## Clip-Worthy Moment Criteria

When mining episodes, look for these 8 types of moments:

### 1. Tactical Specificity
**What it is:** Concrete, actionable advice with specific numbers or steps
**Example:** "Call 10 FSBOs every Tuesday at 9am" (not "work hard")
**Why it works:** Immediately implementable, high perceived value

### 2. Contrarian Take
**What it is:** Goes against conventional real estate wisdom
**Example:** "Stop doing open houses — here's what works instead"
**Why it works:** Pattern interrupt, creates debate/engagement

### 3. Emotional Resonance
**What it is:** Story that hits you in the gut
**Example:** Guest shares their lowest moment before breakthrough
**Why it works:** Builds connection, memorable, shareable

### 4. Memorable One-Liner
**What it is:** Quotable phrase that sticks
**Example:** "Your database is your retirement account"
**Why it works:** Easy to remember, shareable, brand-building

### 5. Pattern Reveal
**What it is:** Contrasts what most do vs. what top performers do
**Example:** "Most agents prospect when they need deals. Top producers prospect when they don't."
**Why it works:** Creates "aha" moment, aspirational

### 6. Surprising Statistic
**What it is:** Numbers that make you stop scrolling
**Example:** "87% of agents quit within 5 years — here's why the 13% survive"
**Why it works:** Credibility, pattern interrupt, curiosity

### 7. Permission Slip
**What it is:** Frees agents from guilt or shame
**Example:** "It's okay to fire bad clients"
**Why it works:** Emotional relief, builds trust and loyalty

### 8. Mindset Shift
**What it is:** Reframes how you see the business
**Example:** "You're not in the real estate business — you're in the relationship business"
**Why it works:** Transformative, memorable, shareable

## 60-Second Video Script Format

```
**HOOK (0:00-0:08)**
[Pattern interrupt — surprising statement, question, or bold claim that stops the scroll]

**SETUP (0:08-0:18)**
[Context — who is this about, what's the situation, why should they care]

**INSIGHT (0:18-0:40)**
[The meat — the actual advice, tactic, or story. Be specific and tactical.]

**REFRAME/APPLICATION (0:40-0:52)**
[Why this matters, how to apply it to their business]

**CTA (0:52-0:60)**
[What to do next — question to ponder, action to take, or invitation to engage]
```

### Hook Formulas That Work

| Formula | Example |
|---------|---------|
| Contrarian statement | "Stop asking for referrals. Do this instead." |
| Surprising stat | "The top 1% of agents do this one thing differently..." |
| Question | "What if everything you learned about cold calling was wrong?" |
| Story tease | "This agent was about to quit. Then she discovered..." |
| Permission slip | "You're allowed to hate open houses." |
| Pattern interrupt | "I interviewed 700 top producers. They all said the same thing." |

## Recruitment Integration

**Strategy Pivot (Feb 2026):** Content now serves TWO purposes:
1. **External** - Attract new agents via social
2. **Internal** - Make current Kale agents feel valued so they refer friends

See: `~/Downloads/jennica-workflow 4/docs/REFERRAL_RECRUITING_STRATEGY.md`

### External: Content to Conversation

1. **Viewer engages** with video (like, comment, share)
2. **DM sequence** triggered or manual outreach
3. **Discovery call** scheduled
4. **Episode recommendations** sent based on their stated challenges
5. **Nurture sequence** continues with relevant content
6. **Recruitment conversation** when timing is right

### Internal: Agent Appreciation ("Thought of You" Play)

1. **Jennica identifies** agent challenge (from CRM notes, conversations)
2. **Matches to clip** that addresses their specific problem
3. **Sends personalized message**: "Saw this, thought of you"
4. **Builds goodwill** → agent more likely to refer friends

**Daily target:** 5 personalized clip sends per day

### Tracking Content-Sourced Leads

In Close CRM, track:
- Source: Which video brought them in (Video - Instagram, Video - TikTok, etc.)
- Content pillar that resonated
- Avatar type based on engagement
- Clips sent as follow-up
- Conversion to recruit
- Referring agent (if from warm intro)
