[00:01:16] And now, onto our show.
[00:01:31] I am Happy Debug with the Keeping It Realist Seniors.
[00:01:35] I'm Kim Bukberg and today I'm talking about two things your videos for social media must have.
[00:01:41] We're talking about this because obviously you're listening to this.
[00:01:45] Maybe you're in your car.
[00:01:46] You're on the subway.
[00:01:47] I don't know.
[00:01:48] Maybe you're on a boat.
[00:01:49] And it's very important to understand the top two things.
[00:01:53] I think there's so much advice out there about social media.
[00:01:55] But I think there's really two things you need to adhere to as you build your social plan.
[00:01:59] My name is Kim Bukberg.
[00:02:01] I love teaching real estate agents how to grow their business with video.
[00:02:04] That is basically what I do.
[00:02:06] I spent 20 years in media and I won six awards for my video marketing work.
[00:02:10] And what I do now is I lead a program called Video Boot Camp and I do one-on-one work with
[00:02:15] agents across the country.
[00:02:17] And one thing that I see a lot of people doing, there's like two different things that I'm going to
[00:02:22] tweak and make easier and give you the right advice on today in this episode.
[00:02:28] You can find me online at KimBurgRITP ERG and I have a free download.
[00:02:33] 10 tips to make amazing videos that grow your revenue and how to shine on cameras.
[00:02:39] These are like downloads that you absolutely need and it'll be linked down to the show notes.
[00:02:42] So when we're talking about the two things you need for video, I've broken it down to the two
[00:02:49] seas. Connection and credibility.
[00:02:54] So a lot of people honestly have that personal content covered, which I like to put under the
[00:03:02] connection piece. Like there are a lot of content people feel comfort with doing where it's
[00:03:09] making you look a human, right? Whether it's content about your family, your kids, your dog,
[00:03:14] whatever. I find that people are broken into, they either have that connection content,
[00:03:20] but then they don't have the credibility, which is a second-see, one or the other.
[00:03:25] They lean in towards one or the other. So the connection is having people know you like you
[00:03:31] trust you. The credibility piece is someone going to feel that you, I don't want to say you're
[00:03:41] deserving of, but are they going to trust you with a huge transaction, right? Their home is a huge
[00:03:46] transaction. So the second-see is credibility and you really need both pieces for social media
[00:03:52] videos, but not just video, but all content to really work. So I'm going to give you some ideas
[00:03:57] right now on pieces of content that you can make that align with the two Cs that will grow your
[00:04:02] business. So in terms of connection, that's that more personal type of content.
[00:04:09] So a way to start thinking about that, and I have a little sheet of like thought starters that
[00:04:14] you can ask yourself, you know, questions that will work for this is what lights you up? That's
[00:04:22] always a great way to start when you're coming up with more personal type of content. What lights
[00:04:27] you up? What do you love talking about? And sometimes I try to push people a lot of times I find that
[00:04:34] when agents come to me, there's actually too much personal content and not enough of the credibility
[00:04:38] content, but I'm going to start just for explanation sake in the connection piece. So you can start
[00:04:43] asking questions like, what lights you up? What makes you laugh? Why did you do this? The professional
[00:04:49] content? Why did you do this? What are you into? Like do you have any hobbies? Personal but professional
[00:04:56] stories. So that can be a crazy deal you did or a really hard deal you did. Something family related.
[00:05:05] Now the way to start doing this is to take the questions I just asked you, write them down,
[00:05:11] and answer them to the camera one at a time. That's the easiest and still very effective way to
[00:05:17] start creating social content that will really help people get to know you. I think we all know this,
[00:05:23] of course, you know this, you're a real estate agent. It's all about relationships. So don't worry,
[00:05:28] like, oh, why am I posting a video about my family on vacation? You will get a lot more engagement
[00:05:35] on your family vacation image than you will on your expert video. That's okay. But don't forget
[00:05:41] part of what you're doing on social media is staying in people's, staying top of mind for people.
[00:05:47] So it's very important to realize that it's not like wrong or bad or whatever to show a video about
[00:05:53] your family vacation. In fact, it's important because most people know you, right? They know you as a
[00:05:59] whole person, a parent, a dog owner, a Italian speaker, a unicycle writer. I don't think you're a
[00:06:07] unicycle writer. But so as long as you're bringing people into your world, you're doing it right.
[00:06:14] However, now having said that, you do need that other piece. So I'm going to recap on what you need
[00:06:20] for connection. Connection is the content that are going to help you, that is going to help you
[00:06:27] connect with people. It's going to help them feel like they know you. That can be personal content,
[00:06:32] it could be hobby based content. That can be you answering questions about why you do real estate.
[00:06:38] Maybe you pivoted. Maybe you did another job before. How did you get into real estate?
[00:06:42] Now, the important thing when you're answering these questions is to feel personal.
[00:06:47] Is to answer the question in a warm way, not robotic. You're excited to talk about the stuff.
[00:06:53] So let's make sure we're getting that energy and enthusiasm. I always remember the phrase is not
[00:06:58] just what you say. It's how you say it. So if I say, I love making, I love helping people make
[00:07:05] videos. You're like, no, you don't. But if I say, I love helping people make videos. That's that.
[00:07:13] By the way, my voice is like a little raspy right now because I got up early and I couldn't
[00:07:18] really sleep because the sun came in. So before the kids are awake, I'm recording my episode.
[00:07:22] But in my voice is a little scratchy because that's what it sounds like when it's 6.45 in the
[00:07:27] morning, friends, okay, a little insight. Maybe that's too much information, but maybe it's not.
[00:07:31] Drop me a note on Instagram if that's you. If you like, get up before the kids and you're like,
[00:07:35] I'm just going to get 45 minutes of work done. Okay, anyway, we move you all. So we have that
[00:07:41] C connection piece. And then the other C is credibility. A lot of people, I really see this missing
[00:07:48] from their pages. So at the very base level, credibility is expert content. It lets people see
[00:07:56] that you're an expert. So that could be advice. That could be awards you're getting. Maybe you're
[00:08:04] the top five offices in the area. Maybe you're top 20 agent. Maybe you're top 1% agent, whatever.
[00:08:11] If you don't have these awards yet, don't worry. You can lean into the expert content.
[00:08:17] And I'm not a big advocate of the just list of just sold videos because I don't think that they
[00:08:22] let people know who you are. However, I do understand that they're important because it shows people
[00:08:27] A, that you're working. And even let's those sellers or buyers love you. You know, let's
[00:08:32] those sellers love you. They see that you're giving their home love and you're excited about it. So
[00:08:37] I do think it's important. But just just listen, just so that there's not going to grow your business.
[00:08:41] People do not know you from that. So the credibility piece, the credibility piece is how when you
[00:08:49] want to sit down and really teach people. A good way to start with this. And by the way, it's
[00:08:54] very, very hard to just sit down and say, what do I want to teach people? It's very hard to have
[00:08:58] like a blank sheet of paper in front of you and start digging at it. So the one thing I would say
[00:09:03] for that is start writing down the questions you are asked. Start writing down the questions you
[00:09:10] are asked most often. And I want you to sit down with the camera and start answering them.
[00:09:16] That is the easiest and most straightforward way to start making expert content.
[00:09:21] Another thing you can do, and this is a great tool for tech GBT, you can put in your demo. I got
[00:09:27] this actually from an amazing real estate agent that I work with me, Randy. You can put in who you
[00:09:33] are. Hi, I'm an agent based in New York City. My demo are, you know, first time home buyers.
[00:09:41] They're interested in this. Please give me 20 questions, 20 questions, 20 answers that they're
[00:09:47] interested in. And then I wouldn't just read back the answers that GBT gives you. I would really
[00:09:52] like make sure to put your spin on it as the world becomes more robotic. It's important for you to
[00:09:57] be even more human. But that's a great place to start. If GBT, Google, all that are giving you
[00:10:04] these questions that people are asking, that's a wonderful place to start. So I would definitely
[00:10:09] start with that. And other expert content is really, I think that we all have, you can say,
[00:10:18] well, I can talk about anything. We all have an area that we're more excited about or that we
[00:10:22] get asked more often or that we could talk about for like an hour. So if you're going to talk
[00:10:26] about something for an hour, what would those things be? Sit down and start recording. When you
[00:10:31] first start, feel free to have a friend help you out. It's hard to just talk to a camera. It's
[00:10:36] hard to talk to an inanimate object. I understand that. So have somebody sit behind the camera and
[00:10:41] help you feel more comfortable. I'm now, even though I'm a little more smart. I'm very comfortable
[00:10:48] on camera. I have been doing this for quite a while. I have a weekly podcast called the exit
[00:10:52] interview where I have every Friday, I drop a five minute mini marketing masterclass. And
[00:10:59] everyone's there. I interview self-employed folks who have advice on how to grow your business and
[00:11:03] also find balance. I now talk to inanimate objects like my microphones all the time. So I'm
[00:11:10] very comfortable on camera. But you get there. The only way you got there is through practicing.
[00:11:15] And so it's important to keep putting yourself on camera. So my challenge for you today is A,
[00:11:20] I want you to follow me so we can stay in touch on Instagram at Kim Rickard or LinkedIn.
[00:11:24] And I want you to make either a connection or a credibility video today,
[00:11:30] maybe tomorrow if you're filling if you're in the car, maybe tomorrow. I want you to film a video
[00:11:36] like that. For a connection video, that can be you answering the question, what's a crazy deal I did?
[00:11:42] Maybe it's a video of you doing something you love, talking about something you love. Maybe it's
[00:11:47] a video of you on a family vacation. One of those three and you're going to post that, you're going
[00:11:51] to tag me. And then the other one, the other option is credibility. And when you talk to the camera
[00:11:57] and giving your expert advice. So I want you to remember the two C's connection and credibility are
[00:12:02] the key to growing your videos and social media content. It's the key to growing on social media.
[00:12:08] So don't forget to grab my free download. It's at KimRitburg.com,
[00:12:13] slash newsletter, or just like pops up when you go to my website. And make sure to follow me on

[00:12:33] all of those things messaging and content to grow your business. So that's really fun. And when
[00:12:37] stays are self-employed folks. All right, I hope you have an awesome day. And I hope this was helpful.
[00:12:42] I know a lot of people are on summer vacation, so I hope you're enjoying wherever you are.
