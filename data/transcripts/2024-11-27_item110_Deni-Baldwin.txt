[00:02:28] One.
[00:02:37] MUSIC
[00:02:42] Today on the show, our guest is Denny Baldwin with ProVision
[00:02:46] Well.
[00:02:46] They are headquartered in Arizona.
[00:02:48] However, they work with REALTORS from all over the United
[00:02:54] States.
[00:02:55] So they just happen to be based in Arizona.
[00:02:56] But let me tell you more about Denny.
[00:02:58] Now, Denny is a certified public accountant.
[00:03:00] She's a CPA.
[00:03:01] She has over 24 years of public accounting experience
[00:03:04] at her time at ProVision.
[00:03:06] She is specialized in working with entrepreneurs.
[00:03:08] She has served all types of clients ranging from large,
[00:03:12] publicly held corporations to closely held partnerships
[00:03:15] and LLCs.
[00:03:16] She is experienced or she is experienced

[00:03:42] in the show notes.
[00:03:43] But ProVisionWelf.com is where you go to learn more.
[00:03:46] Denny, welcome to the show.
[00:03:48] Thank you very much.
[00:03:49] Well, I am excited to talk to you.
[00:03:50] And it's fun because normally tax stuff maybe is a bit dry.
[00:03:55] But it's not dry for me because it actually
[00:03:58] is a nice break from normally what we do on the show,
[00:04:01] which is just talk to talk to top producers
[00:04:03] and say, how'd you build your business?
[00:04:04] And that's really fun.
[00:04:05] But it's nice once in a while to also say,
[00:04:08] hey, by the way, while you're building your business,
[00:04:10] all of our listeners, what are some of the best strategies
[00:04:13] to not pay more in taxes than you ought to?
[00:04:16] And maybe even some ways to save or at least be more efficient
[00:04:20] in your finances.
[00:04:21] So we excited to have this chat.
[00:04:23] But let's start with you.
[00:04:25] Were you always wanting to be an accountant?
[00:04:27] How'd you get into being a CPA?
[00:04:30] It's probably not the most exciting career out there.
[00:04:34] But I knew from the time I was very young
[00:04:36] that I wanted to be an accountant.
[00:04:39] Oh my gosh.
[00:04:40] Says, nobody ever.
[00:04:42] Nobody ever.
[00:04:42] Nobody ever.
[00:04:43] So one time I was young, I was probably seven
[00:04:46] and I went to my grandma's accountant with her.
[00:04:48] We walked in tax season.
[00:04:50] I didn't know.
[00:04:51] But I walked into this office
[00:04:52] and the funniest thing is there's this plush maroon carpet.
[00:04:56] And the office is gorgeous.
[00:04:58] And this is in the late 80s or early 90s, let's say.
[00:05:02] And I'm just like, wow, this must be a good profession.
[00:05:05] You must make a lot of money.
[00:05:06] This place is really cool.
[00:05:09] That sticks in the back of my mind.
[00:05:11] But in high school, I specialized
[00:05:13] and took a lot of business classes and that type of thing.
[00:05:16] And just the numbers really were fun to me and they made sense.
[00:05:20] So just kind of stumbled upon it.
[00:05:23] And I actually worked at a small CPA firm in high school.
[00:05:25] That same CPA firm.
[00:05:26] Oh my gosh.
[00:05:27] Oh, that is wild.
[00:05:31] So that's amazing.
[00:05:32] And you know too, I was thinking about my own accountant
[00:05:33] who I care, I like very much.
[00:05:36] I'm not sure she wanted to be an accountant, you know,
[00:05:39] eight years old.
[00:05:41] But, but if I were to choose an accountant
[00:05:43] if I didn't have one, I would want one.
[00:05:45] That was like, I knew from the age of seven or eight.
[00:05:48] I mean, it sounds silly, but it really is kind of a neat thing
[00:05:51] and I'm glad that you're in this industry, you know,
[00:05:53] most young women or girls want to be
[00:05:57] ballerinas or astronauts or whatever princesses.
[00:06:00] And I like that that you are more business minded
[00:06:03] and here you are all these years later.
[00:06:06] And obviously providing tremendous value to people.
[00:06:09] So we all, you know, Texas are one of those things
[00:06:11] where we don't, none of us really like to do it as far,
[00:06:15] at least I shouldn't speak for everyone.
[00:06:16] I don't like to do it.
[00:06:17] But I certainly appreciate a good CPA who can do a lot of it for me
[00:06:22] and tell me, oh, you should do something this way
[00:06:23] as opposed to that way.
[00:06:24] And that's our intention on the show.
[00:06:26] Just, oh, by the way, I want to make a quick disclaimer.
[00:06:29] We, we meaning the royal we of the people
[00:06:32] who put this podcast together.
[00:06:34] We are not tax-strad specialists like Denny.
[00:06:36] So take everything that Denny talks about today
[00:06:39] with as entertainment.
[00:06:41] Do not take it as specific tax advice.
[00:06:43] Your situation may be very different
[00:06:45] and go get your own advice from a registered CPA.
[00:06:50] Or if you don't have a CPA, please,
[00:06:52] Provision wealth would love to talk to you.
[00:06:53] Their CPAs are amazing like Denny.
[00:06:55] So just wanted to make that quick disclaimer.
[00:06:57] This is not tax advice,
[00:06:58] but it is a conversation about tax strategies
[00:07:01] that these top agents utilize
[00:07:03] and maybe you can consider using as well.
[00:07:05] Okay, Denny, let's get into it.
[00:07:07] So let's first talk about,
[00:07:10] I would like to start with kind of maybe,
[00:07:13] things that people who aren't working with a CPA
[00:07:17] might not know.
[00:07:19] So these would be real estate agents
[00:07:21] who are getting paid as independent contractors
[00:07:24] and they are paying their taxes on their own.
[00:07:30] What's the difference between that
[00:07:33] and deciding and incorporating?
[00:07:35] So let's sort of talk about why somebody
[00:07:38] would consider incorporating
[00:07:40] or maybe why they should stay as an independent contractor.
[00:07:43] Sure, yeah, and there's some texts reasons why,
[00:07:47] but there's also some legal reasons, right?
[00:07:49] And so I'm not an attorney,
[00:07:51] DJ's not an attorney.
[00:07:52] However, generally speaking,
[00:07:54] if you're a sole proprietor and you're just a contractor,
[00:07:58] you don't have that liability protection, right?
[00:08:01] So even if you decide to maybe create an entity
[00:08:05] but not incorporate,
[00:08:07] that will give you some sort of asset protection.
[00:08:09] So that being said,
[00:08:11] you probably need to consult with an asset protection attorney
[00:08:13] from that standpoint to make sure
[00:08:15] you're doing everything right from
[00:08:16] an asset protection standpoint, right?
[00:08:18] So I wanted to kind of start from there.
[00:08:20] Then when we talk about tax purposes,
[00:08:23] really you want to make sure that it doesn't matter
[00:08:26] either way, you're still entitled to deductions
[00:08:29] whether or not you're a sole proprietorship
[00:08:31] or if you have an entity of some sort,
[00:08:34] whether it be an LLC taxed as a sole proprietorship
[00:08:37] or an LLC taxed as an S-corp,
[00:08:40] you're still entitled to take the same deductions.
[00:08:43] It just gives you a little bit,
[00:08:45] there's pros and cons to both.
[00:08:46] Yeah, let's go through that.
[00:08:48] So let's start with independent contractor pros and cons.
[00:08:52] Yep, so E's is a pro.
[00:08:54] Or I should say sole proprietors slash independent contractor.
[00:08:57] So this is a situation where you as an agent,
[00:09:00] you don't have a true corporation,
[00:09:04] you are getting paid directly to yourself
[00:09:06] from the brokerage that you work at.
[00:09:09] Those checks are made payable to you,
[00:09:11] to taxes are not taken out,
[00:09:12] and then you are responsible for making those payments.
[00:09:14] So, okay, just wanted to set the stage.
[00:09:16] Yep, nope, thank you.
[00:09:17] So really the first reason people do it
[00:09:20] is for one, they may not know, right?
[00:09:23] Second is it's the easiest way, right?
[00:09:25] You get the checks, you put them in your bank account,
[00:09:28] and then you have to track expenses separately,
[00:09:30] but it's easy.
[00:09:31] You don't have to file a separate tax return
[00:09:34] for that type of situation.
[00:09:38] And that's probably the easiest thing is the pros, okay?
[00:09:42] The cons are, you don't have the asset protection
[00:09:45] that I talked about before,
[00:09:46] having a legal entity if something were to happen.
[00:09:49] Second is that, you know, for the most part,
[00:09:55] you don't have options in the future,
[00:09:57] you don't have the flexibility to potentially become
[00:10:00] a corporation if it's gonna benefit you.
[00:10:02] And so there's really not a lot of differences
[00:10:04] between a sole proprietor and being a LLC,
[00:10:09] which is a limited liability corporate company
[00:10:11] with you being the only member, right?
[00:10:14] There's really not a whole lot of difference.
[00:10:16] From a tax perspective, it's reported exactly the same way
[00:10:19] on your tax return, okay?
[00:10:21] The only difference is legally
[00:10:23] are you protected or are you not for the most part?
[00:10:25] And that's a good point because we should talk about
[00:10:28] being a sole proprietor and independent contractor,
[00:10:32] the idea of asset protection has to do with maybe
[00:10:35] lawsuits essentially, right?
[00:10:36] So what we're talking about is, you know,
[00:10:38] you're maybe you're on a showing with somebody,
[00:10:42] they slip and fall, or maybe that's,
[00:10:45] and I don't even know if that would qualify,
[00:10:46] but let's just say somebody thought you didn't do
[00:10:49] what you were supposed to do as a real estate agent
[00:10:51] and goes to sue your business to say,
[00:10:54] hey, I think I'm owed some damages here
[00:10:56] for whatever happens in an independent contractor relationship
[00:11:01] that that person's assets, personal assets are at play
[00:11:06] possibly in that scenario, correct?
[00:11:08] If they're independent contractor.
[00:11:09] And then if they, if they sue you, they're suing you, right?
[00:11:14] If you have an LLC, you know, then you have that LLC.
[00:11:18] Now, once again, there's a lot more to it
[00:11:21] from a legal standpoint, but just high level, absolutely.
[00:11:25] There's an extra layer of possible protection.
[00:11:27] Protection, yep, correct.
[00:11:29] Yeah, so that's, that's an important thing to know
[00:11:30] because right now with the NAR,
[00:11:32] which you probably wouldn't know a lot about,
[00:11:35] but the National Association of REALTORS within our industry
[00:11:37] had a big settlement recently, you know,
[00:11:40] a lot of people saw this in the news as well.
[00:11:42] But what it really meant for real estate agencies,
[00:11:44] they're now having commission, commission conversations
[00:11:47] that they really in the past probably weren't having.
[00:11:50] So it, it probably does open up a little bit more
[00:11:53] into, you know, people being attorneys being more lit,
[00:11:57] just sort of litigious and wanting to sort of take advantage
[00:12:00] of some of this now.
[00:12:01] So it's a really good thing to consider
[00:12:03] just because you haven't been sued before.
[00:12:06] Does it mean it won't happen in the future?
[00:12:08] And if you're an independent contractor, there's,
[00:12:10] there's risk there.
[00:12:11] Right.
[00:12:11] And honestly, in most cases, setting up an LLC is very easy.
[00:12:16] You know, you could do it with your state corporation commission.
[00:12:19] It's very easy to do.
[00:12:21] You don't necessarily have to, you know,
[00:12:22] pay somebody to do it.
[00:12:23] Some people like to just to make sure that it's done correctly,
[00:12:26] but the amount of protection you have
[00:12:28] and flex the billy going forward is big.
[00:12:32] Yeah, let's, let's talk about the,
[00:12:34] the difference between independent contractor
[00:12:38] and corporation as far as what are the main benefits
[00:12:42] of incorporating?
[00:12:44] Great question.
[00:12:45] Okay, so generally whether you're an independent contractor
[00:12:48] or you have your single member LLC, either way,
[00:12:53] every dollar of net income.
[00:12:55] So what I mean is that is any 1099,
[00:12:57] you get as your gross revenue,
[00:12:58] minus your expenditures is net income.
[00:13:01] Every dollar of net income in those two entity types
[00:13:06] means you're going to be subject to income tax
[00:13:09] at whatever your tax rate is for the year.
[00:13:12] However, in addition, every dollar is subject
[00:13:15] to what we call self-employment tax.
[00:13:18] And so most of your REALTOR, you probably know
[00:13:20] it's self-employment taxes,
[00:13:21] but for those of you that may not, let me explain.
[00:13:24] So if you are a W2,
[00:13:26] let's say that you work for Starbucks or McDonald's,
[00:13:30] you work, you get your W2,
[00:13:31] and in that case, you have social security
[00:13:34] and Medicare withheld,
[00:13:35] but at the same token you may not know,
[00:13:38] your employer is also paying, matching that tax
[00:13:41] and their paying social security and Medicare
[00:13:44] on your wages as well.
[00:13:46] Okay, well, when you look back and you are the employer
[00:13:49] and the employee, guess what?
[00:13:51] You get hit with both.
[00:13:52] So for the most part, 50,000 foot view,
[00:13:55] you're going to be paying an additional 15.3%,
[00:13:59] maybe less than that because there's some other things,
[00:14:01] but self-employment tax is very, very expensive.
[00:14:05] And there's no way to really reduce that.
[00:14:07] There's tax deductions that could reduce net income,
[00:14:10] but self-employment tax is just in addition to.
[00:14:13] So when you have self-proprirationship
[00:14:16] or just an dependent contractor,
[00:14:19] you're going to be paying self-employment tax on 100%.
[00:14:22] So that tax is 15.3%,
[00:14:25] and then the bottom end, that's a deduction,
[00:14:27] or that's a tax,
[00:14:28] but then you do get actual deduction for about half of that.
[00:14:31] So you do get some benefit there,
[00:14:33] but that self-employment tax adds up very, very quickly.
[00:14:37] Okay?
[00:14:37] Yeah, it's amazing.
[00:14:38] $15 out of every 100.
[00:14:40] And again, you getting some of that back in deduction,
[00:14:43] which basically means you don't really get the full amount back,
[00:14:46] you get whatever the taxable amount
[00:14:48] or the tax rate is,
[00:14:49] so maybe you get 30% of it back of that additional amount.
[00:14:53] Either way, it can add up as you said.
[00:14:56] Okay, so that's self-proprirationship independent contractor.
[00:14:59] What if we create an S corporation?
[00:15:02] Yeah, so there's a couple different ways
[00:15:04] that you could actually create a S corporation.
[00:15:06] You could either create an LLC and be taxed as an S corporation,
[00:15:11] or you could create a corporation
[00:15:13] and make an election to be taxed as an S corporation.
[00:15:17] And LLC is more flexible in a way where if you create an LLC
[00:15:21] from the beginning, if you're smaller
[00:15:23] and you don't need to make an S election
[00:15:25] in the beginning years, then fine.
[00:15:27] You have the protection of the LLC, as I mentioned,
[00:15:30] but you don't have to file a separate tax return.
[00:15:32] It just shows up on your schedule,
[00:15:33] see on your personal 1040.
[00:15:35] However, when you get big enough,
[00:15:37] where you have enough income where it makes sense
[00:15:38] to be an S court, then it's flexible enough,
[00:15:42] you can make your S election.
[00:15:43] And then, of course, at that point,
[00:15:46] start filing an S corporation return, so on and so forth.
[00:15:49] But the difference is once you're an S corporation,
[00:15:52] that same net income is no longer subject
[00:15:55] to self-employment tax, which is fantastic, okay?
[00:15:58] Yes, so we're gonna get there.
[00:16:00] So thank you.
[00:16:01] I wanna go back one step only because I know this can be
[00:16:05] a bit heady for our listeners.
[00:16:07] So independent contractor, sole proprietorship,
[00:16:09] we've talked about sort of pros and cons.
[00:16:10] And then LLC, again, just to not,
[00:16:14] so we're not talking about S corp yet,
[00:16:15] we're talking about just setting up an LLC.
[00:16:17] An LLC is a limited liability corporation,
[00:16:19] and that is exactly what it does.
[00:16:21] It limits possible exposure to litigation,
[00:16:26] to, you know, it's basically an asset protection strategy.
[00:16:30] I know a lot of real estate agents who own investment properties
[00:16:34] tend to put those properties in LLCs for specific tax reasons.
[00:16:40] So that's how that works, and then switching over to,
[00:16:44] okay, then why would somebody maybe move
[00:16:47] from LLC to S corp?
[00:16:49] Yep, so really the main reason is to save
[00:16:52] on that self-employment income,
[00:16:53] because you're protected once you have an LLC
[00:16:56] of corporation of some sort, you're protected.
[00:16:59] And I do wanna go back, LLC stands for
[00:17:01] Limited Lively Company.
[00:17:03] Sorry, thank you.
[00:17:04] I said corporation, my apologies, yes, that's correct.
[00:17:09] I'm gonna switch the main benefit, okay, now.
[00:17:11] That being said, you just don't want to create an LLC today
[00:17:15] and make an S election, and now you have to file an 1120S,
[00:17:19] unless it's beneficial to you, okay?
[00:17:21] So generally speaking, there's kind of a break-even point
[00:17:26] that you're making enough income
[00:17:28] that it makes sense for you to make the S election,
[00:17:30] and have to go through and file a whole separate tax return.
[00:17:34] You also then at that point, no longer just have
[00:17:36] to report your income and expenditures.
[00:17:38] You also then have to report your balance sheet,
[00:17:41] which is a little bit more disclosure,
[00:17:43] and it's quite a bit more worth
[00:17:45] than just doing it on a schedule C.
[00:17:48] Now, one step further, as I mentioned,
[00:17:51] being an S corporation, you're no longer subject
[00:17:54] to that self-employment tax.
[00:17:55] However, the IRS won't let you off 100% free and clear.
[00:18:00] At that point, then once you get that acceptance
[00:18:03] from the IRS, you then have to become
[00:18:05] an employee of your own S corporation, okay?
[00:18:09] Which means you're playing unemployment tax
[00:18:12] because you are now an employee.
[00:18:14] So an S corporation essentially is,
[00:18:17] I have a corporation, if I'm the sole owner,
[00:18:20] I own this corporation, which I have one of these,
[00:18:23] actually I have a few of these,
[00:18:24] and I am the sole owner, and I'm also an employee.
[00:18:28] So as a result, I get a W2, believe it or not,
[00:18:32] from my corporation, so what happens is,
[00:18:34] now, for listeners, they know that I'm not a practicing
[00:18:37] REALTOR, but let's just assume that I am a practicing
[00:18:39] REALTOR, because I'm actually paid very similarly
[00:18:42] to how REALTORS get paid.
[00:18:44] So my company, my brokerage pays my,
[00:18:47] I'm sorry, my corporation, and my corporation
[00:18:49] then pays me as an employee, I get a salary,
[00:18:52] and there's tremendous value there.
[00:18:55] Now, before we get into the meat of the S corporation,
[00:19:00] and I know there isn't a hard line in the sand about this,
[00:19:03] but approximately what income level might somebody start
[00:19:07] to explore, hey, it does make sense to maybe consider
[00:19:11] moving away from sole proprietorship to a corporation.
[00:19:15] Yeah, I think somewhere between $40,000,
[00:19:19] you wanna start thinking about it,
[00:19:20] and then by the time you hit 50,
[00:19:23] that's kind of a good break even point.
[00:19:25] And of course, your tax situation could be different,
[00:19:28] because you might have a spouse that has a lot higher income,
[00:19:31] that your tax rate's higher or lower,
[00:19:33] and so that's kind of a ballpark to start talking to your
[00:19:37] accountant about it and thinking about it is a good rule of thumb.
[00:19:41] So great, thank you for that.
[00:19:43] So basically, once you get to $40,000 or above,
[00:19:45] it's a good idea to talk to a CPA,
[00:19:47] see if it makes sense to make that transition up.
[00:19:50] And yes, and I know my accountant told me,
[00:19:53] there was a year or two where it didn't make sense
[00:19:56] for me to do it and said, don't worry,
[00:19:57] you're not there yet, once you're,
[00:19:59] and then we got there, eventually.
[00:20:00] And one of the main things that we've mentioned
[00:20:05] is you're now an employee, you get a salary,
[00:20:07] or rather you get paid in a W2 sort of structure
[00:20:11] from your corporation.
[00:20:12] Now that might seem confusing to you because as REALTORS,
[00:20:16] you're not receiving steady income,
[00:20:17] that's easily able to be distributed,
[00:20:20] unless of course you're doing a ton of transactions,
[00:20:22] but for the rest of us, we go through peaks and valleys
[00:20:25] in our business.
[00:20:26] So this idea of having to pay myself a salary
[00:20:29] might seem daunting.
[00:20:31] Is it okay if I don't pay myself every pay period?
[00:20:35] Like are there any rules around, I'm an employee,
[00:20:37] I need to get paid a certain number of times per year
[00:20:40] by my employer.
[00:20:42] I mean, every situation's a little bit different.
[00:20:46] One of the guidelines, and so really kind of depends
[00:20:49] on your circumstances, but generally,
[00:20:52] you don't want to set yourself up on a payroll
[00:20:55] in January that you end up paying yourself
[00:20:57] in creating a loss with your company.
[00:21:00] That doesn't make any sense.
[00:21:01] So in the IRS's eyes, they want to make sure
[00:21:04] that you're paying yourself a fair and reasonable salary
[00:21:07] for what you're doing.
[00:21:09] So the way that I like to explain that to clients
[00:21:12] because I don't understand what that means.
[00:21:14] So let me just run through quick numbers,
[00:21:16] real simple numbers.
[00:21:18] Let's say that you make 200,000 gross coming
[00:21:21] from your brokerage.
[00:21:23] Right, so that's all of the commission I earned.
[00:21:26] My brokerage has paid me or my company.
[00:21:28] I guess in this case, has paid my company,
[00:21:30] my S corporation, $200,000 in commissions.
[00:21:34] Yep, and then let's just say that you have
[00:21:37] 50,000 of expenditures.
[00:21:38] I mean, that could be office expense, vehicle expense.
[00:21:42] And, you know, I know you've got all the things,
[00:21:44] all the things, right?
[00:21:45] So let's say before anything else, you have,
[00:21:48] let's say $150,000 of net income, all right?
[00:21:51] So the IRS would frown upon you paying yourself
[00:21:54] a salary of $10,000, right?
[00:21:56] Right, because that is, they would say
[00:21:58] that's not fair and reasonable.
[00:22:00] Correct.
[00:22:01] However, on the other hand, really 150 probably
[00:22:04] isn't fair and reasonable either,
[00:22:05] because if you were going to do that,
[00:22:07] why wouldn't you just stay in a single member
[00:22:09] a little seat, right?
[00:22:10] And so the general rule is that, remember,
[00:22:13] when you have your own corporation now,
[00:22:16] you're the employer and you're the owner of the company, right?
[00:22:20] So in that situation, you actually get paid two ways.
[00:22:23] You get paid via your W2 that you're paying yourself.
[00:22:26] As an employee.
[00:22:27] As an employee.
[00:22:28] And then you're going to pay tax on any remaining net income.
[00:22:33] And then of course, you get to take that as a distribution.
[00:22:35] We won't get into that right now.
[00:22:37] You know, but that being said,
[00:22:39] what we always tell clients in industries,
[00:22:42] you pretend for a second that,
[00:22:44] and you can't really do this
[00:22:46] when you're your only employee.
[00:22:48] But theoretically, if you were going to never, ever,
[00:22:53] sell another home and you need to hire somebody
[00:22:56] to do that work for you,
[00:22:57] how much would you need to pay them?
[00:22:59] In many situations and industries,
[00:23:02] that is considered a fair and reasonable compensation.
[00:23:05] If they have 20 years of experience,
[00:23:06] maybe it's more or less or whatever.
[00:23:08] But it works a little different
[00:23:10] when you're the only employee and you are your business.
[00:23:14] But it really just depends on your facts and circumstances.
[00:23:17] And really, you know, on the amount of income
[00:23:20] and how much you're really working
[00:23:21] to generate that revenue.
[00:23:23] Yeah. And so your CPA will help determine
[00:23:27] what is what they believe a fair and reasonable salary is.
[00:23:32] And it's interesting because there really are no specific
[00:23:34] guidelines from the IRS around,
[00:23:36] you have to pay yourself a certain percentage of net income.
[00:23:39] Like they don't really have that rule.
[00:23:41] It's kind of a just do it in a reasonable way.
[00:23:45] And hopefully we won't audit you kind of scenario.
[00:23:49] And essentially, right, it's kind of like,
[00:23:51] let's probably err on the side of conservative
[00:23:54] just to be safe.
[00:23:55] But at the same time, what's nice about that is,
[00:23:57] so if you have a $200,000 company income,
[00:24:02] that's the amount of income you earned in your business,
[00:24:05] you have 150,000 net income after expenses, as you said.
[00:24:08] So I'm just making this number up.
[00:24:11] I know nothing about what fair and reasonable might be
[00:24:13] for 150,000.
[00:24:14] But let's just say it's 75,000.
[00:24:16] We'll just say it's half of, you know,
[00:24:18] and maybe that's reasonable.
[00:24:19] Now you might say, well, I can't really survive on 75,000.
[00:24:23] Right?
[00:24:23] In other words, my expenses are beyond that.
[00:24:26] So what does somebody do in that scenario?
[00:24:28] Where we think, okay, 75 seems like the right number
[00:24:31] for fair and reasonable.
[00:24:32] Your CPA will tell you.
[00:24:33] And if you're like, ooh, that doesn't really cover everything.
[00:24:36] So then what?
[00:24:37] Yep, great question.
[00:24:39] So what you have to remember is go back to what I said,
[00:24:42] you're the employer and the employee of the company,
[00:24:46] you're the owner.
[00:24:47] So you're gonna be taxed on your W2.
[00:24:49] So if you take that 150,
[00:24:51] you're paying yourself compensation of 75,000,
[00:24:53] you have 75,000 left of net income after your cable.
[00:24:57] Okay, so that is going to,
[00:25:00] once you prepare your S corporate turn,
[00:25:02] you're gonna receive what's called a K1.
[00:25:04] Which is, it's the S corporations form
[00:25:08] that tells you what your income should be
[00:25:11] when you're doing your personal return
[00:25:12] and what you pick up an income.
[00:25:14] So on your personal return,
[00:25:15] you're picking up 75,000 of W2.
[00:25:18] And then you happen to be picking up 75,000
[00:25:20] of business income from the S corporation.
[00:25:23] So your taxed on 150, okay?
[00:25:25] Now remember that being said,
[00:25:28] you've only been paid out to 75.
[00:25:31] So because you're paying tax on that remaining 75,000,
[00:25:35] it's in the S court,
[00:25:36] but you're entitled to take that out of your S corporation
[00:25:39] anytime you want to.
[00:25:40] Because you're paying tax on it.
[00:25:42] And so it's yours.
[00:25:43] And you get to take it out
[00:25:45] with no additional tax consequence.
[00:25:47] And yes, so the main,
[00:25:50] so for everyone listening,
[00:25:51] you've 150,000 in this example of net income,
[00:25:55] you're paying yourself a salary,
[00:25:57] a W2 salary of 75,000.
[00:25:59] There's an extra 75,000 now sitting in the bank
[00:26:01] for the corporations bank account.
[00:26:04] And yes, you can make distributions
[00:26:07] to cover additional,
[00:26:08] I mean, you are the owner of the company assumingly
[00:26:11] and you still have access to that money.
[00:26:15] Okay, cool.
[00:26:16] I think we got through that.
[00:26:17] So, but we should also mention there's some,
[00:26:20] there's a potential negative with S corporations.
[00:26:23] We already talked about if you don't make enough money
[00:26:25] and S corporation probably doesn't make enough sense.
[00:26:27] If the business doesn't make enough money,
[00:26:28] it probably doesn't make sense.
[00:26:29] Also, I believe, and please correct me if I'm wrong,
[00:26:32] but S corporations do not necessarily protect
[00:26:36] as well against litigation, correct?
[00:26:39] Is that versus LLC?
[00:26:42] Well, for the most part,
[00:26:44] you know, you have an LLC or you have a corporation
[00:26:48] and both of them are separate legal entities.
[00:26:51] And so, honestly, I would talk to an asset protection
[00:26:54] attorney because I can't advise you.
[00:26:56] Gotcha.
[00:26:57] As I remember, LLCs are actually created via the states, right?
[00:27:03] Different states have different rules.
[00:27:05] And so, there's a whole bucket of different discussion
[00:27:10] with regards to that that asset protection attorneys,
[00:27:14] that's what they do.
[00:27:15] You know, I can't really tell you with certainty
[00:27:18] the pros and cons of all of the litigation.
[00:27:20] Sure.
[00:27:21] Yeah, definitely reach out to an attorney
[00:27:24] to find out what makes the most sense.
[00:27:27] I know it gets, it seems that a lot of people
[00:27:29] with an investment, real estate portfolios
[00:27:33] tend to put those, their buildings,
[00:27:35] their real property in LLCs for some sort of protection
[00:27:41] standpoint.
[00:27:42] And then for commissions and things,
[00:27:45] real estate agents tend to use S corporations again,
[00:27:48] talk to your accountant and your attorney.
[00:27:51] Quick question.
[00:27:53] And I only know this because I've set up both an LLC
[00:27:55] and an S Corp.
[00:27:57] At least in my state, and I don't know if this is
[00:28:00] applicable in all states,
[00:28:01] but the S corporation was much less expensive to set up
[00:28:05] than the LLC.
[00:28:06] I don't know if that's a universal thing.
[00:28:09] And oh, no, I'm sorry, the S corporation
[00:28:10] was more expensive.
[00:28:11] My apologies.
[00:28:12] I had that backwards.
[00:28:13] What state was that in?
[00:28:15] Illinois.
[00:28:16] Okay.
[00:28:17] So generally, each state, once again,
[00:28:19] when you create entities,
[00:28:21] you do it in each particular state.
[00:28:24] So for example, if you create an LLC in the state of California,
[00:28:28] it's 800 bucks a year just to maintain that LLC.
[00:28:31] Oh, wow.
[00:28:32] Whereas like in many other states,
[00:28:34] you set up an entity and it costs 25 bucks,
[00:28:38] 50 bucks, 75, 100, and you never pay anything.
[00:28:41] So every state is different.
[00:28:43] Now I will tell you just from a high level,
[00:28:47] and this piggybacks on what you said,
[00:28:49] generally speaking, when you have an operating trader business
[00:28:52] where you like real estate, business,
[00:28:55] where you're earning money
[00:28:57] and you're actually doing something providing a service,
[00:29:00] and a corporation, an S corporation, remember,
[00:29:04] you can become an S corporation either through an LLC
[00:29:06] where it's very flexible or create the,
[00:29:08] either way, it's tax of the S corporation.
[00:29:10] So there's legal entities.
[00:29:11] There's either sole proprietor,
[00:29:12] which gives you no protection, LLC or corporation.
[00:29:16] Those are really the only legal ways to form a company
[00:29:20] or a business, I should say.
[00:29:22] And then you get the choice,
[00:29:23] whether you wanna be a partnership in some cases
[00:29:26] and S corporation or a C court,
[00:29:27] and that's all for tax purposes.
[00:29:29] So it's, you're kind of splitting hairs
[00:29:31] in certain situations depending on language.
[00:29:34] So when you're talking to either an attorney or CPA,
[00:29:37] you need to make sure you're clear
[00:29:38] on are they talking about
[00:29:39] from a legal perspective or a tax perspective?
[00:29:42] I wanna ask just a thank you.
[00:29:44] I wanna ask just a more of a sort of outer,
[00:29:48] I don't know, maybe more of a question
[00:29:50] that people probably have heard at some point in their life
[00:29:52] and see if this applies in this scenario.
[00:29:55] Would it ever make sense?
[00:29:57] We, you know, a lot of people know that in Delaware,
[00:29:59] for example, there are some benefits to opening a business
[00:30:03] in Delaware.
[00:30:05] And is there any benefit for real estate ages
[00:30:08] to consider doing that
[00:30:09] if they don't live in Delaware, for example?
[00:30:13] I would tell every state's again different.
[00:30:16] Now generally speaking,
[00:30:18] when you are providing a service
[00:30:20] that LLC needs to be created
[00:30:23] or the industry,
[00:30:24] in this state and get you're doing the work, okay?
[00:30:26] Now, stating that, putting that aside,
[00:30:30] when you are dealing with real estate, right?
[00:30:33] And we do a lot of real estate like investing
[00:30:35] and you had mentioned, you know,
[00:30:38] a lot of people prefer to set those up as LLCs
[00:30:41] versus S-Corp's.
[00:30:42] And let me tell you the reason why real quick.
[00:30:43] So generally speaking,
[00:30:45] when you're providing a service
[00:30:46] and S-Corp is beneficial
[00:30:47] from the self employment tax standpoint,
[00:30:50] which we talked about,
[00:30:51] but when you actually hold what's called appreciating assets,
[00:30:55] like real estate buildings and houses and things like that,
[00:30:58] you generally do not want those in a corporation
[00:31:01] because if you end up wanting to refinance down the road,
[00:31:06] if there's any appreciation,
[00:31:09] the act of refinancing could trigger gain.
[00:31:12] And all you're trying to do is get out some of your money.
[00:31:14] So it's very, very important
[00:31:16] to make sure that you're consulting an accountant
[00:31:18] or CPA before putting things in entities
[00:31:23] because once it's in,
[00:31:25] I have clients come to me all the time
[00:31:26] that have real estate in an S corporation
[00:31:28] and they're like, well, what do I do?
[00:31:30] And I'm like, let's see,
[00:31:32] let's see how much it's appreciated.
[00:31:33] And then we make decisions based on that.
[00:31:36] Yeah, that makes sense.
[00:31:37] That's a really good point.
[00:31:38] So again, all of these decisions should not be made
[00:31:41] by anyone other than a licensed professional CPA
[00:31:44] because these are really important decisions to make
[00:31:48] and you know, odds are you're just not going to know
[00:31:51] as much of course as a seasoned professional.
[00:31:54] Let's talk about some other things
[00:31:56] that real estate agents deal with
[00:31:58] and how that may affect whether,
[00:32:01] how if they're incorporated or not.
[00:32:02] So as an independent contractor,
[00:32:05] most real estate agents start out as independent contractors
[00:32:08] and they are not often given group health insurance.
[00:32:11] It's not usually a thing that's provided.
[00:32:13] Independent contractors is very difficult
[00:32:14] to get group health insurance.
[00:32:16] So a lot of us go out onto the market
[00:32:19] and we purchase our own major medical policies
[00:32:22] from you know, Blue Cross or whatever provider you choose.
[00:32:28] And then my question is,
[00:32:31] are those premiums in an independent contractor relationships
[00:32:34] or anything we can do, sorry,
[00:32:36] an independent contractor or sole proprietors structure,
[00:32:39] do those health insurance premiums,
[00:32:41] is there any benefit to doing that
[00:32:43] buying my own health insurance?
[00:32:45] Is it smarter to do that?
[00:32:46] And again, I know there isn't a clear cut answer necessarily
[00:32:49] but in an independent or in a sole proprietor
[00:32:51] or in a corporation.
[00:32:55] Yeah, so you actually get a tax deduction via business
[00:33:00] if you purchase health insurance.
[00:33:03] Now there are, the IRS is very particular
[00:33:06] in the way that you have to do that.
[00:33:08] So let me give you an example.
[00:33:09] So if you're going to be an S corporation
[00:33:11] or if you're in S corporation,
[00:33:13] you purchase health insurance, it's very specific
[00:33:16] and there's actually an IRS write up on this.
[00:33:18] But what they say is if you're in S court,
[00:33:21] the policy could either be in your name or the business name
[00:33:24] and you can pay the premiums or the business
[00:33:27] could pay the premiums.
[00:33:29] But the key in order to get the legitimate deduction
[00:33:32] is that that amount, let's say that it's $15,000
[00:33:35] for the health insurance,
[00:33:36] that amount needs to be included in your W2.
[00:33:40] So what ends up happening is the expense actually happens
[00:33:44] at the entity level.
[00:33:46] But on your W2, and there's certain boxes,
[00:33:49] Box 1 and Box 14 that need to have,
[00:33:53] I believe it's Box 14, need to have that self-employed
[00:33:57] health insurance number in them.
[00:33:58] That tells you're accountant when they're doing your
[00:34:00] personal return, it's included in your line 1,
[00:34:04] which just inflated your W2 income.
[00:34:07] But Box 14 tells you that you actually get a deduction
[00:34:12] offsetting that.
[00:34:13] So on your personal return, it's an in and out
[00:34:16] and you get the deduction on the entity.
[00:34:18] But if you don't report it that way,
[00:34:19] then the IRS could come in and disallow that deduction
[00:34:22] completely.
[00:34:22] Just by doing a couple simple things,
[00:34:24] making sure you're doing it right,
[00:34:26] you now get a deduction for $15,000.
[00:34:29] Wow, and there are some really fun deductions
[00:34:34] inside of S corporations that you get to do
[00:34:37] that you don't necessarily get to do as an independent
[00:34:41] contractor, sole proprietor.
[00:34:43] For example, because you are in Scapiration,
[00:34:46] there are shareholders, it might just be you,
[00:34:48] but there are shareholders, you can host shareholder meetings.
[00:34:51] And you can host those, I think they allow one a month,
[00:34:55] I don't quote me on that, I believe there's some sort
[00:34:57] of allocation there that you can do regular meetings.
[00:35:00] And you could even do parties.
[00:35:02] I think they allow a couple of parties a year as well.
[00:35:04] So there's really interesting things that you can do
[00:35:06] because if you think if you were a much bigger corporation,
[00:35:09] you would have, you would have these pretty intense
[00:35:11] shareholder meetings, you probably have a board of directors,
[00:35:13] you'd have other people who have a financial stake
[00:35:16] in the company and you would need to be reporting to them
[00:35:18] on a regular basis.
[00:35:19] So these meetings make sense.
[00:35:20] Well, if you're an independent, sorry, if you're the sole owner
[00:35:23] and sole employee, you can have those meetings
[00:35:25] with yourself technically, again, talk to your account
[00:35:28] and about what's reasonable and what's fair
[00:35:31] and what the IRS won't go, well, wait a minute,
[00:35:34] there's a lot of these meetings going on,
[00:35:36] when you're just a sole owner,
[00:35:37] but there are some neat deductions that will open up
[00:35:40] as a result, is that accurate to say?
[00:35:43] Yeah, so there's a lot of different deductions
[00:35:45] that you're entitled to get.
[00:35:46] Now remember, when you're operating a business,
[00:35:49] the key, and as we talked about,
[00:35:51] the IRS always likes to have these,
[00:35:55] like phrases, like reasonable compensation, right?
[00:35:59] So when you're thinking about a business,
[00:36:00] it's ordinary and necessary deductions, right?
[00:36:04] So what you want to kind of keep in mind,
[00:36:06] is generally speaking, if you're thinking about it,
[00:36:09] and you say, okay, I wonder if this is deductible,
[00:36:11] which for one, always check with your CPA, right?
[00:36:14] However, when you think about it and talk about it,
[00:36:17] it's like, are all the other agents out there
[00:36:20] doing the same thing and, or am I being unreasonable, right?
[00:36:25] So, if let's say, let's talk about meals, for example, right?
[00:36:29] Let's say that I'm an agent, and I'm gonna go meet
[00:36:32] my CPA for lunch, and I pick up the tab,
[00:36:35] and all you talk about is business,
[00:36:37] then that's gonna be a deductible meal.
[00:36:39] So the IRS says that you get a 50% deduction
[00:36:42] for tax purposes on meals, okay?
[00:36:45] Which is great, because I mean,
[00:36:47] what I'm talking about is, those things
[00:36:50] that are ordinary, necessary, are absolutely deductible,
[00:36:53] okay, in the IRS's eyes.
[00:36:55] What is not deductible is every day you're driving into
[00:36:58] the office, or to go show a client,
[00:37:00] stopping at Dunkin' Donuts or Starbucks
[00:37:02] to get your daily Joe, that's not deductible,
[00:37:06] because you're not talking business.
[00:37:08] I mean, you have to eat every day,
[00:37:09] your everyday meals are not included,
[00:37:12] but true business meals are, true business meetings are.
[00:37:16] Personal uses of vehicles is absolutely allowed,
[00:37:21] all of those things, including home office, right?
[00:37:24] I'm kind of talking about a lot of different topics
[00:37:26] we might wanna dive into a couple of those a little bit more,
[00:37:29] but those are the types of things,
[00:37:30] if you as an agent, sin think about,
[00:37:33] what do I do during a business day?
[00:37:36] Okay, should this be a deduction?
[00:37:39] Those are things you could be talking,
[00:37:40] should be talking to your accountant about,
[00:37:42] just to make sure that you're following the rules
[00:37:43] and not being absorbed or, you know,
[00:37:46] outside of ordinary, necessary.
[00:37:49] So we're talking about things like, again,
[00:37:51] home office, a space and supplies.
[00:37:54] We're talking about vehicle.
[00:37:56] If you are driving to business and doing business
[00:37:58] in your vehicle, we're talking about
[00:38:02] possible entertainment expenses,
[00:38:03] if you're going out and meeting with clients
[00:38:06] and picking up the tab,
[00:38:08] and really all sorts of marketing and advertising
[00:38:11] and really necessary and reasonable expenses
[00:38:16] that any business would consider
[00:38:19] to be a business expense.
[00:38:20] Absolutely, yep.
[00:38:22] Now, a question is about,
[00:38:26] one question I have regarding sort of taxation is,
[00:38:33] well, let me back up a little, one other step.
[00:38:36] So if we talk about taxes in the respect of paying them,
[00:38:43] oh, I wanted, I know what I wanted to ask you
[00:38:44] about S corporations,
[00:38:44] how often are you paying taxes in an S corporation?
[00:38:49] Correct question.
[00:38:50] And this is something we haven't talked about.
[00:38:52] So there's actually two types of corporations,
[00:38:54] just for everybody's knowledge.
[00:38:56] There's a C Corp in an S Corp.
[00:38:58] Generally speaking, a C Corp is its own entity
[00:39:01] and pays its own tax, okay?
[00:39:03] And for the most part, those are reserved for, you know,
[00:39:07] many, many big businesses, worldwide companies,
[00:39:09] that type of thing, unless there's a special use for them.
[00:39:13] But what we deal with most in, with entrepreneurs
[00:39:16] on a day to day basis is an S Corp.
[00:39:18] And an S Corp and a partnership and a single member LLC
[00:39:22] are all considered to be what we call flow through entities.
[00:39:25] So there is actually no tax income tax paid
[00:39:29] at the S Corp level, okay?
[00:39:30] So let's dive into that a little bit.
[00:39:32] Let me go back to my example,
[00:39:34] when we had 75,000 of W2 income,
[00:39:36] remember, throughout the year you get to choose
[00:39:39] how much federal and state with holding you have
[00:39:43] coming out of that 75,000 to pay Uncle Sam for the year.
[00:39:47] You get to choose.
[00:39:49] However, the other 75,000 that is actually coming
[00:39:52] from the business, you've paid no income tax on, right?
[00:39:56] So generally speaking, the IRS wants their money
[00:40:00] every quarter, okay?
[00:40:02] Which is every April 15th, June 15th, September 15th
[00:40:08] and January 15th.
[00:40:09] And I know those aren't four months apart.
[00:40:12] I know, some are closer than others,
[00:40:15] but in general, that's the rule.
[00:40:17] And so the IRS says, you know,
[00:40:19] even though you're not a W2 and you get paid, you know,
[00:40:23] quarterly or monthly or biweekly or semi-monthly or whatever,
[00:40:28] we're getting our money through payroll deposits
[00:40:31] on an ongoing basis.
[00:40:33] Now we want you to pay that remaining liability quarterly.
[00:40:37] So in many cases, you can talk to your CPA,
[00:40:40] there's a couple different ways to handle it.
[00:40:42] You can either increase your W2 with holdings
[00:40:45] to cover your estimated taxes that's coming
[00:40:48] from your income of your S corporation
[00:40:52] or you can do a combination where you're taking
[00:40:55] with holding on the W2 and then you're also then
[00:40:58] having them help you estimate what that tax
[00:41:01] is gonna be and you pay it quarterly
[00:41:03] or you don't have to do any withholding at all
[00:41:06] and you could pay it all in via your withholdings.
[00:41:08] It really depends, you know, on you and kind of your situation
[00:41:13] and kind of how you budget and how it's gonna work best for you,
[00:41:16] but the IRS does tell you as long as you have paid in at least
[00:41:20] 90% of your current liability or 110%
[00:41:26] of the prior your liability, then you can go ahead
[00:41:30] and they know you're not gonna know exactly
[00:41:32] what you're making throughout the year.
[00:41:33] They know that.
[00:41:34] But if you get reasonably close, then you will not get penalized.
[00:41:38] It's actually called the safe harbor
[00:41:39] and you can pay any remaining tax by April 15th
[00:41:44] and you're in great shape.
[00:41:45] Yeah, I know for me just to give an example.
[00:41:48] So I have an NS corporation where I, my business
[00:41:51] that money the business makes that does not come to my income
[00:41:56] as an employee, that we pay quarterly on to the Fed
[00:42:01] and then, and I also am paying my own withholding
[00:42:05] for my own personal every quarter as well.
[00:42:07] So I knock them out every quarter and, but again,
[00:42:11] there's other ways to do that, I guess.
[00:42:13] But if you were not incorporated,
[00:42:16] if you were an independent contractor for 1099 employee,
[00:42:20] you could technically pay every,
[00:42:23] all of your taxes at the end.
[00:42:25] Is that accurate or do you have to pay quarterly
[00:42:26] in an independent?
[00:42:27] You can, the challenge is is you might get paid,
[00:42:31] hit with what's called an estimated,
[00:42:33] underpayment of estimated tax penalty,
[00:42:35] and there's penalties for all different things,
[00:42:39] but you would need to run those numbers
[00:42:40] with your accountant to determine
[00:42:42] whether or not that makes sense for you.
[00:42:44] Some people say, I don't wanna pay anything until April
[00:42:48] and they would rather get hit with the penalty
[00:42:49] because they could earn more on their money
[00:42:52] than they would have to pay the IRS.
[00:42:53] And so it's really a calculation
[00:42:56] and kind of what fits you best, to be honest.
[00:42:58] What is estimated payment penalties tend to look like?
[00:43:03] Is it like a percentage?
[00:43:04] Is it a flat cash?
[00:43:07] That's a percentage.
[00:43:07] 
[00:43:07] And I don't remember off the top of my head when it is,
[00:43:10] but it's not big.
[00:43:11] It's not big.
[00:43:12] So if you really wanted to roll the dice,
[00:43:14] you could take all of that money, invest it,
[00:43:16] in something, hopefully that's reasonable and safe.
[00:43:19] And then you would be earning more, hopefully,
[00:43:22] by the end of the year,
[00:43:24] and then that would actually be possibly a smarter play.
[00:43:27] But you'd have to be very disciplined
[00:43:28] and you'd really have to know what you were doing
[00:43:30] because nobody wants to get to the,
[00:43:31] April 15th and go, oh, I forgot I have 30,000 in taxes.
[00:43:36] Now here's something I do want to bring up
[00:43:37] about one of the potential.
[00:43:40] I don't want to call it a challenge,
[00:43:42] but it may be a perceived challenge
[00:43:44] because at first when this happened to me,
[00:43:46] I was like, oh no, I ruined my ability to get loans.
[00:43:51] So in an S corporation, again,
[00:43:52] we'll use the example of the 200,000 going into the company
[00:43:55] we're paying ourselves 75,000 fair and reasonable,
[00:43:58] as we believe that, and again,
[00:44:00] this is just for illustrative purposes.
[00:44:01] And so now we have to,
[00:44:03] we want to go refinance our home,
[00:44:05] or rather, we want to buy a property,
[00:44:07] a primary residence where they're going to look at our income.
[00:44:11] Now, let's say you're buying a $500,000 property
[00:44:15] and you're putting down a certain percentage,
[00:44:17] but on paper, the 75,000 that you earn personally
[00:44:21] as an employee might not really be in what a lender would like
[00:44:27] to see for income for somebody
[00:44:29] buying that sort of priced property.
[00:44:32] So I know this has happened to me where they go,
[00:44:34] oh, it doesn't look like you make very much money at all,
[00:44:37] based on what you're showing us here,
[00:44:39] your paystubs and your tax return.
[00:44:42] So let's talk about what happens in that scenario.
[00:44:45] I mean, I've been through it a number of times,
[00:44:47] but I just want to quell everybody's fears
[00:44:49] about when that happens, there are solutions to that.
[00:44:53] There are, there are.
[00:44:54] Now, and of course, every lender's different,
[00:44:56] and as agents, you guys might have dealt with this
[00:44:58] with your own clients, we were, they have a financing problem,
[00:45:03] but generally, when you're dealing with the Freddie
[00:45:06] and Fannies of the world, the people who are doing
[00:45:09] all of the legwork, they're checking boxes, right?
[00:45:13] I mean, do you have a W2 check, check, check?
[00:45:15] If you're self-employed in any capacity,
[00:45:17] that adds a complexity factor, in my opinion.
[00:45:21] And so it becomes a little bit more challenging
[00:45:23] and you need to make sure that the lender
[00:45:25] is a lender that you're working with,
[00:45:27] understand self-employed people.
[00:45:29] And so really, they still should be considering
[00:45:32] your income coming from your escorpiration,
[00:45:35] absolutely.
[00:45:36] And so it is trickier than if it was all on a W2,
[00:45:40] but either way, whether you're self-employed 50% or 100%
[00:45:44] or whatever, it gets a little bit more complicated
[00:45:46] from the lender's point of view.
[00:45:47] Yeah, so just, I'll tell people my experience.
[00:45:50] So oftentimes, when I walk, I'm not refinancing now,
[00:45:53] because I did, or actually got alone during the wonderful times
[00:45:58] of 3% rates.
[00:46:00] And so as a result, I won't be refinancing anytime soon
[00:46:04] and probably never again on that particular property.
[00:46:06] But what I will tell you is, in past properties,
[00:46:09] when I have needed to refinance
[00:46:11] because the rate was cheaper, then yeah,
[00:46:14] the lender would look at my W2 and come and go,
[00:46:17] hmm, this doesn't seem like it's enough
[00:46:19] to be able to support your current mortgage
[00:46:21] that you're paying.
[00:46:22] So what, but we get to include all of the assets
[00:46:28] that the company has, meaning that other,
[00:46:30] in this case, the other 75,000 that's sitting in the company.
[00:46:34] Because again, you're the sole owner,
[00:46:35] you have access to that money, you can take distributions.
[00:46:38] So don't worry too much when you go for loans.
[00:46:41] You, what I've done is just explained to lenders,
[00:46:44] here is actually, you know, you would send
[00:46:46] in your company information, lenders understand this,
[00:46:48] they know what S-corp's are, they deal with this every single day,
[00:46:51] this is not unusual.
[00:46:53] But if you just were to send your W2 income,
[00:46:55] they might say, hmm, this isn't enough.
[00:46:58] And the reason why you're doing an S-corp,
[00:47:00] is to not pay yourself as much as you might
[00:47:04] pay yourself in other structures.
[00:47:06] So this is a very common thing.
[00:47:08] Don't worry about it too much,
[00:47:10] but talk to your lender about what they need
[00:47:12] in order to satisfy, you know,
[00:47:14] because they're the ones putting up the risk.
[00:47:16] Absolutely.
[00:47:17] Awesome. Now, how long does it take to set up
[00:47:23] an S-corperation or an LLC or a C-corp?
[00:47:27] Like how quickly does it take months?
[00:47:30] Does it take, is it instant?
[00:47:32] For because we have people that are,
[00:47:33] you know, it's getting towards the end of the year.
[00:47:35] If they wanted, oh, let me back up one more time.
[00:47:37] I'm sorry, let's ask a different question.
[00:47:39] If somebody still wanted to for 2024,
[00:47:43] this is now recording on November 20th of the year.
[00:47:47] We're almost at the end of the year.
[00:47:48] Can somebody go back and say, you know what?
[00:47:51] I started my corporation on January 1st of this year
[00:47:54] or at this point is it too late,
[00:47:56] we have to start over in 2025.
[00:47:59] Good question and the answer to that is it depends, okay?
[00:48:02] So if you are currently structured as an LLC
[00:48:06] as of 1-1 of 2024,
[00:48:08] you can absolutely go ahead and make a retroactive S-election
[00:48:13] back to 1-1 of 24.
[00:48:16] Conversely, if you are just a single member LLC,
[00:48:20] the answer is no, because there's no entity
[00:48:24] to be able to incorporate, right?
[00:48:27] So the question really comes down to,
[00:48:29] do you have, are you already,
[00:48:31] do you already have an entity that you're operating out of?
[00:48:33] If the answer is yes,
[00:48:34] then you have an opportunity to make an S-election.
[00:48:36] If the answer is no, unfortunately, you don't.
[00:48:38] However, guess what?
[00:48:40] We're only about 40 days to the end of the year.
[00:48:43] 1-1, 25 might be a good time to start a new LLC.
[00:48:48] I love that.
[00:48:49] Yeah, okay.
[00:48:50] This has been such a wonderful conversation.
[00:48:53] I don't want to get too far in the weeds with our listeners
[00:48:56] because I think you've given a ton of great information,
[00:48:59] but really at the end of the day,
[00:49:00] what we're really saying is get yourself a CPA.
[00:49:03] Get yourself a CPA that you know like and trust
[00:49:06] and ask them, let's look at everything I have
[00:49:10] and you tell me what the best thing to do.
[00:49:12] And I wholeheartedly recommend, you know,
[00:49:15] ProVisionWelfth, that is Denny's,
[00:49:17] the company Denny's at,
[00:49:18] and they can work with you in all 50 states.
[00:49:21] So what everyone needs to visit,
[00:49:24] ProVisionWelfth.com, ProVisionWelfth.com,
[00:49:26] and they have all sorts of ways to get in touch.
[00:49:30] And by the way, they even talk about this on their website,
[00:49:34] the average client of their saves anywhere from it,
[00:49:36] and again, you know, individual results will vary,
[00:49:39] but they, you know, an average like 10 to 40% savings
[00:49:43] just by going with somebody who really knows what they're doing.
[00:49:46] So I know I'd like to save 10 to 40% in my taxes,
[00:49:50] so I am going to have ProVision take a look at mine
[00:49:54] just to make sure that I am dealing with a good CPA myself.
[00:49:57] It's always good to get a second opinion.
[00:49:59] So I always recommend get a second opinion.
[00:50:02] Let's do it with ProVision, ProVisionWelfth.com,
[00:50:05] reach out to Denny Denny,
[00:50:05] what's the best way somebody should reach out to you?
[00:50:08] Yeah, they can either reach out to us,
[00:50:10] go straight to the website,
[00:50:11] there's a contact option on there, reach out.
[00:50:15] Our team will get you scheduled to figure out
[00:50:17] if if ProVision's a good fit for you
[00:50:18] and just to have a discussion,
[00:50:20] doesn't mean you know you have to become a client,
[00:50:22] but just having that discussion to see
[00:50:23] if we may be a good fit for you,
[00:50:26] and you might be a good fit for us
[00:50:27] with the best place to start,
[00:50:29] or you could call us our phone number 480-467-4400.
[00:50:35] And let's remember to that CPA expense or costs,
[00:50:40] okay, it'd be tax deductible,
[00:50:42] in fact most cases they are.
[00:50:43] So another great reason, it's yes,
[00:50:45] you're gonna pay for the service, of course,
[00:50:47] better than just doing it online
[00:50:50] with one of the online tax software,
[00:50:53] so there's a lot, you do get to deduct
[00:50:55] those expenses as well.
[00:50:56] So anyway, I want everybody to get a second opinion,
[00:50:59] if you have a CPA, if you don't have a CPA,
[00:51:01] get a first opinion from ProVisionWelf.com,
[00:51:03] go to ProVisionWelf.com, tell them that you've heard
[00:51:06] about the adenee on our site, we appreciate that,
[00:51:09] and let's get our taxes in line for 2025,
[00:51:12] and let's save as much as we can.
[00:51:14] One last question, and this is not a political opinion question,
[00:51:18] but I'm curious with the results of the presidential election
[00:51:22] of here in the United States that we just had,
[00:51:26] do we think tax companies and individuals,
[00:51:32] do we anticipate that being a beneficial thing
[00:51:36] for, I'm trying to think the best way to say this,
[00:51:40] do we think taxes are going to be more difficult
[00:51:43] for companies and individuals to pay,
[00:51:46] or do we think they'll be lesser restrictions
[00:51:48] or more benefits with the outcome of the election?
[00:51:53] Yeah, good question.
[00:51:53] So remember the tax, the last big tax cut,
[00:52:00] or tax act, was really when it came to tax rates
[00:52:04] that impacts individuals, was the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017,
[00:52:09] which if you rewind, that was when Trump was in office
[00:52:12] during his first period.
[00:52:17] Now that being said, so I don't think taxes are going to change
[00:52:20] much through 2024, well, 2024 is almost over,
[00:52:24] but a lot of the things that were set back in 2017
[00:52:28] are scheduled to sunset in 2025.
[00:52:32] So I think for 2025, they're probably going to be similar,
[00:52:37] but all bets are off, 26th and future,
[00:52:41] because there's a whole lot of different priorities now,
[00:52:44] then eight years ago, really.
[00:52:46] And so I think they're going to be revisiting some things
[00:52:49] and I've already read some things on what they're wanting to do,
[00:52:52] now that the Republicans are in control of both houses
[00:52:55] and the White House.
[00:52:58] And so that being said, they still want to make some changes.
[00:53:02] If you may or may not be aware,
[00:53:05] bonus appreciation could be a very, very beneficial thing
[00:53:08] for business owners, and that has been phasing out,
[00:53:11] and that was the result of the tax cuts and jobs act.
[00:53:13] If you get benefit here, you have to balance,
[00:53:15] so you have to take something away,
[00:53:17] and now is the time that that is actually sunsetty.
[00:53:20] So we're kind of paying for that now,
[00:53:22] but I do know that that's one of the big things
[00:53:24] that Trump said he wants to get reinstated,
[00:53:26] because that's huge for big business
[00:53:28] and entrepreneurs altogether.
[00:53:30] So I think we're pretty safe for the most part for 2025.
[00:53:34] After that, I think we're going to have to take a,
[00:53:36] they're going to take a bigger look,
[00:53:38] but we have some time for that, which is nice.
[00:53:40] Well, thank you, Denny, that's fantastic news, at least for her,
[00:53:44] at least from a tax perspective,
[00:53:47] at least for the next year or two,
[00:53:48] and then we'll see what happens from there.

OK, let's get to it. My conversation with Denny Baldwin. One. MUSIC Today on the show, our guest is Denny Baldwin with ProVision Well. They are headquartered in Arizona. However, they work with REALTORS from all over the United States. So they just happen to be based in Arizona. But let me tell you more about Denny. Now, Denny is a certified public accountant. She's a CPA. She has over 24 years of public accounting experience at her time at ProVision. She is specialized in working with entrepreneurs. She has served all types of clients ranging from large, publicly held corporations to closely held partnerships and LLCs. She is experienced or she is experienced in many different industries, including real estate, manufacturing, tech, and education.

I mean, they're on all the social networks, of course. But LinkedIn is kind of where they shine. So we'll have a link to all their social channels in the show notes. But ProVisionWelf.com is where you go to learn more. Denny, welcome to the show. Thank you very much. Well, I am excited to talk to you. And it's fun because normally tax stuff maybe is a bit dry. But it's not dry for me because it actually is a nice break from normally what we do on the show, which is just talk to talk to top producers and say, how'd you build your business? And that's really fun. But it's nice once in a while to also say, hey, by the way, while you're building your business, all of our listeners, what are some of the best strategies to not pay more in taxes than you ought to? And maybe even some ways to save or at least be more efficient in your finances. So we excited to have this chat. But let's start with you. Were you always wanting to be an accountant? How'd you get into being a CPA? It's probably not the most exciting career out there. But I knew from the time I was very young that I wanted to be an accountant. Oh my gosh. Says, nobody ever. Nobody ever. Nobody ever. So one time I was young, I was probably seven and I went to my grandma's accountant with her. We walked in tax season. I didn't know. But I walked into this office and the funniest thing is there's this plush maroon carpet. And the office is gorgeous. And this is in the late 80s or early 90s, let's say. And I'm just like, wow, this must be a good profession. You must make a lot of money. This place is really cool. That sticks in the back of my mind. But in high school, I specialized and took a lot of business classes and that type of thing. And just the numbers really were fun to me and they made sense. So just kind of stumbled upon it. And I actually worked at a small CPA firm in high school. That same CPA firm. Oh my gosh. Oh, that is wild. So that's amazing. And you know too, I was thinking about my own accountant who I care, I like very much. I'm not sure she wanted to be an accountant, you know, eight years old. But, but if I were to choose an accountant if I didn't have one, I would want one. That was like, I knew from the age of seven or eight. I mean, it sounds silly, but it really is kind of a neat thing and I'm glad that you're in this industry, you know, most young women or girls want to be ballerinas or astronauts or whatever princesses. And I like that that you are more business minded and here you are all these years later. And obviously providing tremendous value to people. So we all, you know, Texas are one of those things where we don't, none of us really like to do it as far, at least I shouldn't speak for everyone. I don't like to do it. But I certainly appreciate a good CPA who can do a lot of it for me and tell me, oh, you should do something this way as opposed to that way. And that's our intention on the show. Just, oh, by the way, I want to make a quick disclaimer. We, we meaning the royal we of the people who put this podcast together. We are not tax-strad specialists like Denny. So take everything that Denny talks about today with as entertainment. Do not take it as specific tax advice. Your situation may be very different and go get your own advice from a registered CPA. Or if you don't have a CPA, please, Provision wealth would love to talk to you. Their CPAs are amazing like Denny. So just wanted to make that quick disclaimer. This is not tax advice, but it is a conversation about tax strategies that these top agents utilize and maybe you can consider using as well. Okay, Denny, let's get into it. So let's first talk about, I would like to start with kind of maybe, things that people who aren't working with a CPA might not know. So these would be real estate agents who are getting paid as independent contractors and they are paying their taxes on their own. What's the difference between that and deciding and incorporating? So let's sort of talk about why somebody would consider incorporating or maybe why they should stay as an independent contractor. Sure, yeah, and there's some texts reasons why, but there's also some legal reasons, right? And so I'm not an attorney, DJ's not an attorney. However, generally speaking, if you're a sole proprietor and you're just a contractor, you don't have that liability protection, right? So even if you decide to maybe create an entity but not incorporate, that will give you some sort of asset protection. So that being said, you probably need to consult with an asset protection attorney from that standpoint to make sure you're doing everything right from an asset protection standpoint, right? So I wanted to kind of start from there. Then when we talk about tax purposes, really you want to make sure that it doesn't matter either way, you're still entitled to deductions whether or not you're a sole proprietorship or if you have an entity of some sort, whether it be an LLC taxed as a sole proprietorship or an LLC taxed as an S-corp, you're still entitled to take the same deductions. It just gives you a little bit, there's pros and cons to both. Yeah, let's go through that. So let's start with independent contractor pros and cons. Yep, so E's is a pro. Or I should say sole proprietors slash independent contractor. So this is a situation where you as an agent, you don't have a true corporation, you are getting paid directly to yourself from the brokerage that you work at. Those checks are made payable to you, to taxes are not taken out, and then you are responsible for making those payments. So, okay, just wanted to set the stage. Yep, nope, thank you. So really the first reason people do it is for one, they may not know, right? Second is it's the easiest way, right? You get the checks, you put them in your bank account, and then you have to track expenses separately, but it's easy. You don't have to file a separate tax return for that type of situation. And that's probably the easiest thing is the pros, okay? The cons are, you don't have the asset protection that I talked about before, having a legal entity if something were to happen. Second is that, you know, for the most part, you don't have options in the future, you don't have the flexibility to potentially become a corporation if it's gonna benefit you. And so there's really not a lot of differences between a sole proprietor and being a LLC, which is a limited liability corporate company with you being the only member, right? There's really not a whole lot of difference. From a tax perspective, it's reported exactly the same way on your tax return, okay? The only difference is legally are you protected or are you not for the most part? And that's a good point because we should talk about being a sole proprietor and independent contractor, the idea of asset protection has to do with maybe lawsuits essentially, right? So what we're talking about is, you know, you're maybe you're on a showing with somebody, they slip and fall, or maybe that's, and I don't even know if that would qualify, but let's just say somebody thought you didn't do what you were supposed to do as a real estate agent and goes to sue your business to say, hey, I think I'm owed some damages here for whatever happens in an independent contractor relationship that that person's assets, personal assets are at play possibly in that scenario, correct? If they're independent contractor. And then if they, if they sue you, they're suing you, right? If you have an LLC, you know, then you have that LLC. Now, once again, there's a lot more to it from a legal standpoint, but just high level, absolutely. There's an extra layer of possible protection. Protection, yep, correct. Yeah, so that's, that's an important thing to know because right now with the NAR, which you probably wouldn't know a lot about, but the National Association of REALTORS within our industry had a big settlement recently, you know, a lot of people saw this in the news as well. But what it really meant for real estate agencies, they're now having commission, commission conversations that they really in the past probably weren't having. So it, it probably does open up a little bit more into, you know, people being attorneys being more lit, just sort of litigious and wanting to sort of take advantage of some of this now. So it's a really good thing to consider just because you haven't been sued before. Does it mean it won't happen in the future? And if you're an independent contractor, there's, there's risk there. Right. And honestly, in most cases, setting up an LLC is very easy. You know, you could do it with your state corporation commission. It's very easy to do. You don't necessarily have to, you know, pay somebody to do it. Some people like to just to make sure that it's done correctly, but the amount of protection you have and flex the billy going forward is big. Yeah, let's, let's talk about the, the difference between independent contractor and corporation as far as what are the main benefits of incorporating? Great question. Okay, so generally whether you're an independent contractor or you have your single member LLC, either way, every dollar of net income. So what I mean is that is any 1099, you get as your gross revenue, minus your expenditures is net income. Every dollar of net income in those two entity types means you're going to be subject to income tax at whatever your tax rate is for the year. However, in addition, every dollar is subject to what we call self-employment tax. And so most of your REALTOR, you probably know it's self-employment taxes, but for those of you that may not, let me explain. So if you are a W2, let's say that you work for Starbucks or McDonald's, you work, you get your W2, and in that case, you have social security and Medicare withheld, but at the same token you may not know, your employer is also paying, matching that tax and their paying social security and Medicare on your wages as well. Okay, well, when you look back and you are the employer and the employee, guess what? You get hit with both. So for the most part, 50,000 foot view, you're going to be paying an additional 15.3%, maybe less than that because there's some other things, but self-employment tax is very, very expensive. And there's no way to really reduce that. There's tax deductions that could reduce net income, but self-employment tax is just in addition to. So when you have self-proprirationship or just an dependent contractor, you're going to be paying self-employment tax on 100%. So that tax is 15.3%, and then the bottom end, that's a deduction, or that's a tax, but then you do get actual deduction for about half of that. So you do get some benefit there, but that self-employment tax adds up very, very quickly. Okay? Yeah, it's amazing. $15 out of every 100. And again, you getting some of that back in deduction, which basically means you don't really get the full amount back, you get whatever the taxable amount or the tax rate is, so maybe you get 30% of it back of that additional amount. Either way, it can add up as you said. Okay, so that's self-proprirationship independent contractor. What if we create an S corporation? Yeah, so there's a couple different ways that you could actually create a S corporation. You could either create an LLC and be taxed as an S corporation, or you could create a corporation and make an election to be taxed as an S corporation. And LLC is more flexible in a way where if you create an LLC from the beginning, if you're smaller and you don't need to make an S election in the beginning years, then fine. You have the protection of the LLC, as I mentioned, but you don't have to file a separate tax return. It just shows up on your schedule, see on your personal 1040. However, when you get big enough, where you have enough income where it makes sense to be an S court, then it's flexible enough, you can make your S election. And then, of course, at that point, start filing an S corporation return, so on and so forth. But the difference is once you're an S corporation, that same net income is no longer subject to self-employment tax, which is fantastic, okay? Yes, so we're gonna get there. So thank you. I wanna go back one step only because I know this can be a bit heady for our listeners. So independent contractor, sole proprietorship, we've talked about sort of pros and cons. And then LLC, again, just to not, so we're not talking about S corp yet, we're talking about just setting up an LLC. An LLC is a limited liability corporation, and that is exactly what it does. It limits possible exposure to litigation, to, you know, it's basically an asset protection strategy. I know a lot of real estate agents who own investment properties tend to put those properties in LLCs for specific tax reasons. So that's how that works, and then switching over to, okay, then why would somebody maybe move from LLC to S corp? Yep, so really the main reason is to save on that self-employment income, because you're protected once you have an LLC of corporation of some sort, you're protected. And I do wanna go back, LLC stands for Limited Lively Company. Sorry, thank you. I said corporation, my apologies, yes, that's correct. I'm gonna switch the main benefit, okay, now. That being said, you just don't want to create an LLC today and make an S election, and now you have to file an 1120S, unless it's beneficial to you, okay? So generally speaking, there's kind of a break-even point that you're making enough income that it makes sense for you to make the S election, and have to go through and file a whole separate tax return. You also then at that point, no longer just have to report your income and expenditures. You also then have to report your balance sheet, which is a little bit more disclosure, and it's quite a bit more worth than just doing it on a schedule C. Now, one step further, as I mentioned, being an S corporation, you're no longer subject to that self-employment tax. However, the IRS won't let you off 100% free and clear. At that point, then once you get that acceptance from the IRS, you then have to become an employee of your own S corporation, okay? Which means you're playing unemployment tax because you are now an employee. So an S corporation essentially is, I have a corporation, if I'm the sole owner, I own this corporation, which I have one of these, actually I have a few of these, and I am the sole owner, and I'm also an employee. So as a result, I get a W2, believe it or not, from my corporation, so what happens is, now, for listeners, they know that I'm not a practicing REALTOR, but let's just assume that I am a practicing REALTOR, because I'm actually paid very similarly to how REALTORS get paid. So my company, my brokerage pays my, I'm sorry, my corporation, and my corporation then pays me as an employee, I get a salary, and there's tremendous value there. Now, before we get into the meat of the S corporation, and I know there isn't a hard line in the sand about this, but approximately what income level might somebody start to explore, hey, it does make sense to maybe consider moving away from sole proprietorship to a corporation. Yeah, I think somewhere between $40,000, you wanna start thinking about it, and then by the time you hit 50, that's kind of a good break even point. And of course, your tax situation could be different, because you might have a spouse that has a lot higher income, that your tax rate's higher or lower, and so that's kind of a ballpark to start talking to your accountant about it and thinking about it is a good rule of thumb. So great, thank you for that. So basically, once you get to $40,000 or above, it's a good idea to talk to a CPA, see if it makes sense to make that transition up. And yes, and I know my accountant told me, there was a year or two where it didn't make sense for me to do it and said, don't worry, you're not there yet, once you're, and then we got there, eventually. And one of the main things that we've mentioned is you're now an employee, you get a salary, or rather you get paid in a W2 sort of structure from your corporation. Now that might seem confusing to you because as REALTORS, you're not receiving steady income, that's easily able to be distributed, unless of course you're doing a ton of transactions, but for the rest of us, we go through peaks and valleys in our business. So this idea of having to pay myself a salary might seem daunting. Is it okay if I don't pay myself every pay period? Like are there any rules around, I'm an employee, I need to get paid a certain number of times per year by my employer. I mean, every situation's a little bit different. One of the guidelines, and so really kind of depends on your circumstances, but generally, you don't want to set yourself up on a payroll in January that you end up paying yourself in creating a loss with your company. That doesn't make any sense. So in the IRS's eyes, they want to make sure that you're paying yourself a fair and reasonable salary for what you're doing. So the way that I like to explain that to clients because I don't understand what that means. So let me just run through quick numbers, real simple numbers. Let's say that you make 200,000 gross coming from your brokerage. Right, so that's all of the commission I earned. My brokerage has paid me or my company. I guess in this case, has paid my company, my S corporation, $200,000 in commissions. Yep, and then let's just say that you have 50,000 of expenditures. I mean, that could be office expense, vehicle expense. And, you know, I know you've got all the things, all the things, right? So let's say before anything else, you have, let's say $150,000 of net income, all right? So the IRS would frown upon you paying yourself a salary of $10,000, right? Right, because that is, they would say that's not fair and reasonable. Correct. However, on the other hand, really 150 probably isn't fair and reasonable either, because if you were going to do that, why wouldn't you just stay in a single member a little seat, right? And so the general rule is that, remember, when you have your own corporation now, you're the employer and you're the owner of the company, right? So in that situation, you actually get paid two ways. You get paid via your W2 that you're paying yourself. As an employee. As an employee. And then you're going to pay tax on any remaining net income. And then of course, you get to take that as a distribution. We won't get into that right now. You know, but that being said, what we always tell clients in industries, you pretend for a second that, and you can't really do this when you're your only employee. But theoretically, if you were going to never, ever, sell another home and you need to hire somebody to do that work for you, how much would you need to pay them? In many situations and industries, that is considered a fair and reasonable compensation. If they have 20 years of experience, maybe it's more or less or whatever. But it works a little different when you're the only employee and you are your business. But it really just depends on your facts and circumstances. And really, you know, on the amount of income and how much you're really working to generate that revenue. Yeah. And so your CPA will help determine what is what they believe a fair and reasonable salary is. And it's interesting because there really are no specific guidelines from the IRS around, you have to pay yourself a certain percentage of net income. Like they don't really have that rule. It's kind of a just do it in a reasonable way. And hopefully we won't audit you kind of scenario. And essentially, right, it's kind of like, let's probably err on the side of conservative just to be safe. But at the same time, what's nice about that is, so if you have a $200,000 company income, that's the amount of income you earned in your business, you have 150,000 net income after expenses, as you said. So I'm just making this number up. I know nothing about what fair and reasonable might be for 150,000. But let's just say it's 75,000. We'll just say it's half of, you know, and maybe that's reasonable. Now you might say, well, I can't really survive on 75,000. Right? In other words, my expenses are beyond that. So what does somebody do in that scenario? Where we think, okay, 75 seems like the right number for fair and reasonable. Your CPA will tell you. And if you're like, ooh, that doesn't really cover everything. So then what? Yep, great question. So what you have to remember is go back to what I said, you're the employer and the employee of the company, you're the owner. So you're gonna be taxed on your W2. So if you take that 150, you're paying yourself compensation of 75,000, you have 75,000 left of net income after your cable. Okay, so that is going to, once you prepare your S corporate turn, you're gonna receive what's called a K1. Which is, it's the S corporations form that tells you what your income should be when you're doing your personal return and what you pick up an income. So on your personal return, you're picking up 75,000 of W2. And then you happen to be picking up 75,000 of business income from the S corporation. So your taxed on 150, okay? Now remember that being said, you've only been paid out to 75. So because you're paying tax on that remaining 75,000, it's in the S court, but you're entitled to take that out of your S corporation anytime you want to. Because you're paying tax on it. And so it's yours. And you get to take it out with no additional tax consequence. And yes, so the main, so for everyone listening, you've 150,000 in this example of net income, you're paying yourself a salary, a W2 salary of 75,000. There's an extra 75,000 now sitting in the bank for the corporations bank account. And yes, you can make distributions to cover additional, I mean, you are the owner of the company assumingly and you still have access to that money. Okay, cool. I think we got through that. So, but we should also mention there's some, there's a potential negative with S corporations. We already talked about if you don't make enough money and S corporation probably doesn't make enough sense. If the business doesn't make enough money, it probably doesn't make sense. Also, I believe, and please correct me if I'm wrong, but S corporations do not necessarily protect as well against litigation, correct? Is that versus LLC? Well, for the most part, you know, you have an LLC or you have a corporation and both of them are separate legal entities. And so, honestly, I would talk to an asset protection attorney because I can't advise you. Gotcha. As I remember, LLCs are actually created via the states, right? Different states have different rules. And so, there's a whole bucket of different discussion with regards to that that asset protection attorneys, that's what they do. You know, I can't really tell you with certainty the pros and cons of all of the litigation. Sure. Yeah, definitely reach out to an attorney to find out what makes the most sense. I know it gets, it seems that a lot of people with an investment, real estate portfolios tend to put those, their buildings, their real property in LLCs for some sort of protection standpoint. And then for commissions and things, real estate agents tend to use S corporations again, talk to your accountant and your attorney. Quick question. And I only know this because I've set up both an LLC and an S Corp. At least in my state, and I don't know if this is applicable in all states, but the S corporation was much less expensive to set up than the LLC. I don't know if that's a universal thing. And oh, no, I'm sorry, the S corporation was more expensive. My apologies. I had that backwards. What state was that in? Illinois. Okay. So generally, each state, once again, when you create entities, you do it in each particular state. So for example, if you create an LLC in the state of California, it's 800 bucks a year just to maintain that LLC. Oh, wow. Whereas like in many other states, you set up an entity and it costs 25 bucks, 50 bucks, 75, 100, and you never pay anything. So every state is different. Now I will tell you just from a high level, and this piggybacks on what you said, generally speaking, when you have an operating trader business where you like real estate, business, where you're earning money and you're actually doing something providing a service, and a corporation, an S corporation, remember, you can become an S corporation either through an LLC where it's very flexible or create the, either way, it's tax of the S corporation. So there's legal entities. There's either sole proprietor, which gives you no protection, LLC or corporation. Those are really the only legal ways to form a company or a business, I should say. And then you get the choice, whether you wanna be a partnership in some cases and S corporation or a C court, and that's all for tax purposes. So it's, you're kind of splitting hairs in certain situations depending on language. So when you're talking to either an attorney or CPA, you need to make sure you're clear on are they talking about from a legal perspective or a tax perspective? I wanna ask just a thank you. I wanna ask just a more of a sort of outer, I don't know, maybe more of a question that people probably have heard at some point in their life and see if this applies in this scenario. Would it ever make sense? We, you know, a lot of people know that in Delaware, for example, there are some benefits to opening a business in Delaware. And is there any benefit for real estate ages to consider doing that if they don't live in Delaware, for example? I would tell every state's again different. Now generally speaking, when you are providing a service that LLC needs to be created or the industry, in this state and get you're doing the work, okay? Now, stating that, putting that aside, when you are dealing with real estate, right? And we do a lot of real estate like investing and you had mentioned, you know, a lot of people prefer to set those up as LLCs versus S-Corp's. And let me tell you the reason why real quick. So generally speaking, when you're providing a service and S-Corp is beneficial from the self employment tax standpoint, which we talked about, but when you actually hold what's called appreciating assets, like real estate buildings and houses and things like that, you generally do not want those in a corporation because if you end up wanting to refinance down the road, if there's any appreciation, the act of refinancing could trigger gain. And all you're trying to do is get out some of your money. So it's very, very important to make sure that you're consulting an accountant or CPA before putting things in entities because once it's in, I have clients come to me all the time that have real estate in an S corporation and they're like, well, what do I do? And I'm like, let's see, let's see how much it's appreciated. And then we make decisions based on that. Yeah, that makes sense. That's a really good point. So again, all of these decisions should not be made by anyone other than a licensed professional CPA because these are really important decisions to make and you know, odds are you're just not going to know as much of course as a seasoned professional. Let's talk about some other things that real estate agents deal with and how that may affect whether, how if they're incorporated or not. So as an independent contractor, most real estate agents start out as independent contractors and they are not often given group health insurance. It's not usually a thing that's provided. Independent contractors is very difficult to get group health insurance. So a lot of us go out onto the market and we purchase our own major medical policies from you know, Blue Cross or whatever provider you choose. And then my question is, are those premiums in an independent contractor relationships or anything we can do, sorry, an independent contractor or sole proprietors structure, do those health insurance premiums, is there any benefit to doing that buying my own health insurance? Is it smarter to do that? And again, I know there isn't a clear cut answer necessarily but in an independent or in a sole proprietor or in a corporation. Yeah, so you actually get a tax deduction via business if you purchase health insurance. Now there are, the IRS is very particular in the way that you have to do that. So let me give you an example. So if you're going to be an S corporation or if you're in S corporation, you purchase health insurance, it's very specific and there's actually an IRS write up on this. But what they say is if you're in S court, the policy could either be in your name or the business name and you can pay the premiums or the business could pay the premiums. But the key in order to get the legitimate deduction is that that amount, let's say that it's $15,000 for the health insurance, that amount needs to be included in your W2. So what ends up happening is the expense actually happens at the entity level. But on your W2, and there's certain boxes, Box 1 and Box 14 that need to have, I believe it's Box 14, need to have that self-employed health insurance number in them. That tells you're accountant when they're doing your personal return, it's included in your line 1, which just inflated your W2 income. But Box 14 tells you that you actually get a deduction offsetting that. So on your personal return, it's an in and out and you get the deduction on the entity. But if you don't report it that way, then the IRS could come in and disallow that deduction completely. Just by doing a couple simple things, making sure you're doing it right, you now get a deduction for $15,000. Wow, and there are some really fun deductions inside of S corporations that you get to do that you don't necessarily get to do as an independent contractor, sole proprietor. For example, because you are in Scapiration, there are shareholders, it might just be you, but there are shareholders, you can host shareholder meetings. And you can host those, I think they allow one a month, I don't quote me on that, I believe there's some sort of allocation there that you can do regular meetings. And you could even do parties. I think they allow a couple of parties a year as well. So there's really interesting things that you can do because if you think if you were a much bigger corporation, you would have, you would have these pretty intense shareholder meetings, you probably have a board of directors, you'd have other people who have a financial stake in the company and you would need to be reporting to them on a regular basis. So these meetings make sense. Well, if you're an independent, sorry, if you're the sole owner and sole employee, you can have those meetings with yourself technically, again, talk to your account and about what's reasonable and what's fair and what the IRS won't go, well, wait a minute, there's a lot of these meetings going on, when you're just a sole owner, but there are some neat deductions that will open up as a result, is that accurate to say? Yeah, so there's a lot of different deductions that you're entitled to get. Now remember, when you're operating a business, the key, and as we talked about, the IRS always likes to have these, like phrases, like reasonable compensation, right? So when you're thinking about a business, it's ordinary and necessary deductions, right? So what you want to kind of keep in mind, is generally speaking, if you're thinking about it, and you say, okay, I wonder if this is deductible, which for one, always check with your CPA, right? However, when you think about it and talk about it, it's like, are all the other agents out there doing the same thing and, or am I being unreasonable, right? So, if let's say, let's talk about meals, for example, right? Let's say that I'm an agent, and I'm gonna go meet my CPA for lunch, and I pick up the tab, and all you talk about is business, then that's gonna be a deductible meal. So the IRS says that you get a 50% deduction for tax purposes on meals, okay? Which is great, because I mean, what I'm talking about is, those things that are ordinary, necessary, are absolutely deductible, okay, in the IRS's eyes. What is not deductible is every day you're driving into the office, or to go show a client, stopping at Dunkin' Donuts or Starbucks to get your daily Joe, that's not deductible, because you're not talking business. I mean, you have to eat every day, your everyday meals are not included, but true business meals are, true business meetings are. Personal uses of vehicles is absolutely allowed, all of those things, including home office, right? I'm kind of talking about a lot of different topics we might wanna dive into a couple of those a little bit more, but those are the types of things, if you as an agent, sin think about, what do I do during a business day? Okay, should this be a deduction? Those are things you could be talking, should be talking to your accountant about, just to make sure that you're following the rules and not being absorbed or, you know, outside of ordinary, necessary. So we're talking about things like, again, home office, a space and supplies. We're talking about vehicle. If you are driving to business and doing business in your vehicle, we're talking about possible entertainment expenses, if you're going out and meeting with clients and picking up the tab, and really all sorts of marketing and advertising and really necessary and reasonable expenses that any business would consider to be a business expense. Absolutely, yep. Now, a question is about, one question I have regarding sort of taxation is, well, let me back up a little, one other step. So if we talk about taxes in the respect of paying them, oh, I wanted, I know what I wanted to ask you about S corporations, how often are you paying taxes in an S corporation? Correct question. And this is something we haven't talked about. So there's actually two types of corporations, just for everybody's knowledge. There's a C Corp in an S Corp. Generally speaking, a C Corp is its own entity and pays its own tax, okay? And for the most part, those are reserved for, you know, many, many big businesses, worldwide companies, that type of thing, unless there's a special use for them. But what we deal with most in, with entrepreneurs on a day to day basis is an S Corp. And an S Corp and a partnership and a single member LLC are all considered to be what we call flow through entities. So there is actually no tax income tax paid at the S Corp level, okay? So let's dive into that a little bit. Let me go back to my example, when we had 75,000 of W2 income, remember, throughout the year you get to choose how much federal and state with holding you have coming out of that 75,000 to pay Uncle Sam for the year. You get to choose. However, the other 75,000 that is actually coming from the business, you've paid no income tax on, right? So generally speaking, the IRS wants their money every quarter, okay? Which is every April 15th, June 15th, September 15th and January 15th. And I know those aren't four months apart. I know, some are closer than others, but in general, that's the rule. And so the IRS says, you know, even though you're not a W2 and you get paid, you know, quarterly or monthly or biweekly or semi-monthly or whatever, we're getting our money through payroll deposits on an ongoing basis. Now we want you to pay that remaining liability quarterly. So in many cases, you can talk to your CPA, there's a couple different ways to handle it. You can either increase your W2 with holdings to cover your estimated taxes that's coming from your income of your S corporation or you can do a combination where you're taking with holding on the W2 and then you're also then having them help you estimate what that tax is gonna be and you pay it quarterly or you don't have to do any withholding at all and you could pay it all in via your withholdings. It really depends, you know, on you and kind of your situation and kind of how you budget and how it's gonna work best for you, but the IRS does tell you as long as you have paid in at least 90% of your current liability or 110% of the prior your liability, then you can go ahead and they know you're not gonna know exactly what you're making throughout the year. They know that. But if you get reasonably close, then you will not get penalized. It's actually called the safe harbor and you can pay any remaining tax by April 15th and you're in great shape. Yeah, I know for me just to give an example. So I have an NS corporation where I, my business that money the business makes that does not come to my income as an employee, that we pay quarterly on to the Fed and then, and I also am paying my own withholding for my own personal every quarter as well. So I knock them out every quarter and, but again, there's other ways to do that, I guess. But if you were not incorporated, if you were an independent contractor for 1099 employee, you could technically pay every, all of your taxes at the end. Is that accurate or do you have to pay quarterly in an independent? You can, the challenge is is you might get paid, hit with what's called an estimated, underpayment of estimated tax penalty, and there's penalties for all different things, but you would need to run those numbers with your accountant to determine whether or not that makes sense for you. Some people say, I don't wanna pay anything until April and they would rather get hit with the penalty because they could earn more on their money than they would have to pay the IRS. And so it's really a calculation and kind of what fits you best, to be honest. What is estimated payment penalties tend to look like? Is it like a percentage? Is it a flat cash? That's a percentage. And I don't remember off the top of my head when it is, but it's not big. It's not big. So if you really wanted to roll the dice, you could take all of that money, invest it, in something, hopefully that's reasonable and safe. And then you would be earning more, hopefully, by the end of the year, and then that would actually be possibly a smarter play. But you'd have to be very disciplined and you'd really have to know what you were doing because nobody wants to get to the, April 15th and go, oh, I forgot I have 30,000 in taxes. Now here's something I do want to bring up about one of the potential. I don't want to call it a challenge, but it may be a perceived challenge because at first when this happened to me, I was like, oh no, I ruined my ability to get loans. So in an S corporation, again, we'll use the example of the 200,000 going into the company we're paying ourselves 75,000 fair and reasonable, as we believe that, and again, this is just for illustrative purposes. And so now we have to, we want to go refinance our home, or rather, we want to buy a property, a primary residence where they're going to look at our income. Now, let's say you're buying a $500,000 property and you're putting down a certain percentage, but on paper, the 75,000 that you earn personally as an employee might not really be in what a lender would like to see for income for somebody buying that sort of priced property. So I know this has happened to me where they go, oh, it doesn't look like you make very much money at all, based on what you're showing us here, your paystubs and your tax return. So let's talk about what happens in that scenario. I mean, I've been through it a number of times, but I just want to quell everybody's fears about when that happens, there are solutions to that. There are, there are. Now, and of course, every lender's different, and as agents, you guys might have dealt with this with your own clients, we were, they have a financing problem, but generally, when you're dealing with the Freddie and Fannies of the world, the people who are doing all of the legwork, they're checking boxes, right? I mean, do you have a W2 check, check, check? If you're self-employed in any capacity, that adds a complexity factor, in my opinion. And so it becomes a little bit more challenging and you need to make sure that the lender is a lender that you're working with, understand self-employed people. And so really, they still should be considering your income coming from your escorpiration, absolutely. And so it is trickier than if it was all on a W2, but either way, whether you're self-employed 50% or 100% or whatever, it gets a little bit more complicated from the lender's point of view. Yeah, so just, I'll tell people my experience. So oftentimes, when I walk, I'm not refinancing now, because I did, or actually got alone during the wonderful times of 3% rates. And so as a result, I won't be refinancing anytime soon and probably never again on that particular property. But what I will tell you is, in past properties, when I have needed to refinance because the rate was cheaper, then yeah, the lender would look at my W2 and come and go, hmm, this doesn't seem like it's enough to be able to support your current mortgage that you're paying. So what, but we get to include all of the assets that the company has, meaning that other, in this case, the other 75,000 that's sitting in the company. Because again, you're the sole owner, you have access to that money, you can take distributions. So don't worry too much when you go for loans. You, what I've done is just explained to lenders, here is actually, you know, you would send in your company information, lenders understand this, they know what S-corp's are, they deal with this every single day, this is not unusual. But if you just were to send your W2 income, they might say, hmm, this isn't enough. And the reason why you're doing an S-corp, is to not pay yourself as much as you might pay yourself in other structures. So this is a very common thing. Don't worry about it too much, but talk to your lender about what they need in order to satisfy, you know, because they're the ones putting up the risk. Absolutely. Awesome. Now, how long does it take to set up an S-corperation or an LLC or a C-corp? Like how quickly does it take months? Does it take, is it instant? For because we have people that are, you know, it's getting towards the end of the year. If they wanted, oh, let me back up one more time. I'm sorry, let's ask a different question. If somebody still wanted to for 2024, this is now recording on November 20th of the year. We're almost at the end of the year. Can somebody go back and say, you know what? I started my corporation on January 1st of this year or at this point is it too late, we have to start over in 2025. Good question and the answer to that is it depends, okay? So if you are currently structured as an LLC as of 1-1 of 2024, you can absolutely go ahead and make a retroactive S-election back to 1-1 of 24. Conversely, if you are just a single member LLC, the answer is no, because there's no entity to be able to incorporate, right? So the question really comes down to, do you have, are you already, do you already have an entity that you're operating out of? If the answer is yes, then you have an opportunity to make an S-election. If the answer is no, unfortunately, you don't. However, guess what? We're only about 40 days to the end of the year. 1-1, 25 might be a good time to start a new LLC. I love that. Yeah, okay. This has been such a wonderful conversation. I don't want to get too far in the weeds with our listeners because I think you've given a ton of great information, but really at the end of the day, what we're really saying is get yourself a CPA. Get yourself a CPA that you know like and trust and ask them, let's look at everything I have and you tell me what the best thing to do. And I wholeheartedly recommend, you know, ProVisionWelfth, that is Denny's, the company Denny's at, and they can work with you in all 50 states. So what everyone needs to visit, ProVisionWelfth.com, ProVisionWelfth.com, and they have all sorts of ways to get in touch. And by the way, they even talk about this on their website, the average client of their saves anywhere from it, and again, you know, individual results will vary, but they, you know, an average like 10 to 40% savings just by going with somebody who really knows what they're doing. So I know I'd like to save 10 to 40% in my taxes, so I am going to have ProVision take a look at mine just to make sure that I am dealing with a good CPA myself. It's always good to get a second opinion. So I always recommend get a second opinion. Let's do it with ProVision, ProVisionWelfth.com, reach out to Denny Denny, what's the best way somebody should reach out to you? Yeah, they can either reach out to us, go straight to the website, there's a contact option on there, reach out. Our team will get you scheduled to figure out if if ProVision's a good fit for you and just to have a discussion, doesn't mean you know you have to become a client, but just having that discussion to see if we may be a good fit for you, and you might be a good fit for us with the best place to start, or you could call us our phone number 480-467-4400. And let's remember to that CPA expense or costs, okay, it'd be tax deductible, in fact most cases they are. So another great reason, it's yes, you're gonna pay for the service, of course, better than just doing it online with one of the online tax software, so there's a lot, you do get to deduct those expenses as well. So anyway, I want everybody to get a second opinion, if you have a CPA, if you don't have a CPA, get a first opinion from ProVisionWelf.com, go to ProVisionWelf.com, tell them that you've heard about the adenee on our site, we appreciate that, and let's get our taxes in line for 2025, and let's save as much as we can. One last question, and this is not a political opinion question, but I'm curious with the results of the presidential election of here in the United States that we just had, do we think tax companies and individuals, do we anticipate that being a beneficial thing for, I'm trying to think the best way to say this, do we think taxes are going to be more difficult for companies and individuals to pay, or do we think they'll be lesser restrictions or more benefits with the outcome of the election? Yeah, good question. So remember the tax, the last big tax cut, or tax act, was really when it came to tax rates that impacts individuals, was the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017, which if you rewind, that was when Trump was in office during his first period. Now that being said, so I don't think taxes are going to change much through 2024, well, 2024 is almost over, but a lot of the things that were set back in 2017 are scheduled to sunset in 2025. So I think for 2025, they're probably going to be similar, but all bets are off, 26th and future, because there's a whole lot of different priorities now, then eight years ago, really. And so I think they're going to be revisiting some things and I've already read some things on what they're wanting to do, now that the Republicans are in control of both houses and the White House. And so that being said, they still want to make some changes. If you may or may not be aware, bonus appreciation could be a very, very beneficial thing for business owners, and that has been phasing out, and that was the result of the tax cuts and jobs act. If you get benefit here, you have to balance, so you have to take something away, and now is the time that that is actually sunsetty.
