[00:01:16] Today's episode is brought to you by corded.io.
[00:01:20] Are you looking for agents to join your brokerage or team?
[00:01:23] Now as a real estate recruiter, I can tell you the answer is always yes.
[00:01:28] But most agents aren't looking to move right now.
[00:01:31] So how do you know who to contact?
[00:01:33] Well, what if I were to tell you there's a recruiting and retention tool powered by
[00:01:37] artificial intelligence that shows you exactly which agents in your local market are looking
[00:01:42] to leave their brokerage right now and which agents at your own firm are also looking
[00:01:48] to leave you?
[00:01:49] Now I've been recruiting REALTORS for 15 years and I've hired over 2000 agents.
[00:01:54] I can tell you with no exaggeration, this is the tool I've been waiting for.
[00:01:58] Corded's AI looks for trends across dozens of variables for each agent in your market
[00:02:03] and shows you which agents they believe are likely to move.
[00:02:06] Not only does it do that, but corded's AI went and visited my recruiting website and
[00:02:11] read everything I offer.
[00:02:13] So now when I'm recruiting, corded's AI tells me exactly what to say based on that
[00:02:18] agent's needs and what my brokerage can offer.
[00:02:21] It even writes emails for me.
[00:02:23] I've never seen anything like it and I use it every single day.
[00:02:27] Now, if you are looking to grow your brokerage, corded.io is the best tool out there.

[00:04:11] We're excited to do even some more creatively different things in 2026.
[00:04:18] We're not staying straight from our existing formula, but we are adding on some cool ideas.
[00:04:24] And I'm in some talks with some companies right now to do some really fun stuff.
[00:04:27] So I'm hopeful to bring that news to you shortly.
[00:04:30] All right, let's get right to it.
[00:04:31] My conversation with Tim Barat.
[00:04:47] Past advice you've received in real estate.
[00:04:51] A bee authentic.
[00:04:53] Don't try to be somebody else.
[00:04:54] Don't try to copy somebody else's program.
[00:04:56] Be authentic.
[00:04:57] Just have be your real self and have empathy for the people that you're working with.
[00:05:02] Because it's that connection that you'll establish with your clients that will prove your
[00:05:06] worth.
[00:05:09] Authenticity.
[00:05:09] I like it.
[00:05:10] And empathy.
[00:05:11] That's what I'm hearing.
[00:05:13] Now worst advice you've received in real estate.
[00:05:17] Prospect like crazy and try to work with absolutely everybody.
[00:05:20] The thing that is delightful about getting a little bit older is I only work with people
[00:05:24] I like.
[00:05:26] And it makes a huge difference because do you really want referrals from people that
[00:05:31] you can't stand because they're going to refer you people just like them.
[00:05:34] You'll get more people you can't stand.
[00:05:36] So select who you want to work with.
[00:05:40] So be willing to walk away.
[00:05:42] Oh yes.
[00:05:42] And sometimes it's just delightful moments when you fire a client.
[00:05:46] It's just has a great feeling of, you know, there's some people that I really enjoy
[00:05:54] what I do.
[00:05:54] I really like to help people get into houses and it just makes me feel absolutely fabulous
[00:05:58] when I've personally I take a lot of people that otherwise can't get into a home and folks
[00:06:04] that buy houses are 40 times wealthier than people that don't buy houses.
[00:06:08] I look where they'll work with a lot of people that are not being facilitated by the real
[00:06:12] estate community.
[00:06:13] To me that is huge.
[00:06:16] But you know, the thing that really does, you know, does my heart good these things
[00:06:22] to that nature.
[00:06:23] So, you know, taking people to deserve it and work with the people that deserve it and
[00:06:27] use all of your greatest efforts and all your empathy to do the absolute best you can.
[00:06:31] And don't let the, don't let the bombs work you down.
[00:06:36] I love it.
[00:06:37] And since we haven't introduced you yet, so I'm about to, but I'm going to throw one at
[00:06:42] you that you did not know is coming because you have 45 years of experience here.
[00:06:46] And I would like to ask you one last question.
[00:06:49] If you could give advice to your youngest, your younger self, maybe 45 years ago, starting
[00:06:56] in real estate, what would you, what would you say to yourself?
[00:07:02] Invest in real estate earlier.
[00:07:05] You know, I do a tremendous amount of work to get other people real estate in homes and
[00:07:11] investments.
[00:07:12] And the thing that would have been smarter if I'd started investing in the product that
[00:07:15] I know so well, even earlier in my life.
[00:07:19] I love it.
[00:07:21] Tim Burrell is our guest and he is an amazing, amazing person.
[00:07:26] He's a triple threat.
[00:07:27] He's, by the way, Tim Burrell is with RE/MAX United.
[00:07:29] He's in California.
[00:07:30] You are all over, but mostly Orange County, County area, is that accurate?
[00:07:36] Once upon a time, I was in palace 30s.
[00:07:38] I've sighted a lot of sandals.
[00:07:40] I still have a lot of friends there.
[00:07:42] But for a brief time, I had a real estate team in palace, where he's at the same time,
[00:07:47] I had a real estate team in Raleigh.
[00:07:49] Currently, I'm just in Raleigh and do a large amount of work and anything that touches
[00:07:53] Wake County, which is the capital county in North Carolina.
[00:07:59] Oh, my goodness.
[00:08:00] I am so sorry.
[00:08:00] I thought you were West for some reason.
[00:08:01] I thought you were Orange County.
[00:08:03] Maybe I was looking at the RE/MAX United and maybe that's headquarter is there for some
[00:08:08] reason.
[00:08:08] So North Carolina, that is amazing.
[00:08:10] So Tim Burrell is our guest.
[00:08:12] He is a rare triple threat and he is a licensed REALTOR.
[00:08:15] He's an attorney and he's a general contractor.
[00:08:17] I mean, it's really an amazing set of skills.
[00:08:20] There are 45 years experience hands on turning complex deals in the profitable outcomes.
[00:08:24] He's graduate of UCLA School of Law and inductee into the prestigious RE/MAX Hall of Fame.
[00:08:30] He's channeled that hard one expertise into three must read books on negotiating, create
[00:08:35] a great deal, the art of real estate negotiating, and his newest one, which I'm most excited
[00:08:40] about the AI negotiator.
[00:08:41] We're going to be talking about that here.
[00:08:43] And soon to be published another book, his fourth book coming is called AI real estate
[00:08:48] investing, practical guides that show agents and investors how to leverage both timeless
[00:08:52] negotiating principles and cutting edge artificial intelligence to gain a decisive competitive
[00:08:58] edge.
[00:08:58] I want everybody to go pick up the AI negotiator.
[00:09:01] It's called dominate real estate deals with the power of artificial intelligence.
[00:09:05] That is available on Amazon.
[00:09:06] We will have a link to that on the show notes.
[00:09:08] And I want also everybody to check out Tim in all of the things he does.
[00:09:13] He does negotiation, consulting.
[00:09:15] He will help you with continuing education.
[00:09:18] And you want to go to negotiation consult negotiation, negotiate consultant.com.
[00:09:24] Tim, I just want to make sure I got that right.
[00:09:26] Actually, it's negotiating consultant.com.
[00:09:29] I apologize.
[00:09:29] I apologize.
[00:09:30] We have negotiating consult.
[00:09:32] We will have that link in the show notes.
[00:09:34] You don't have to type it in.
[00:09:35] Don't listen to me.
[00:09:36] And just click away.
[00:09:38] And check out Tim.
[00:09:39] He is the real deal.
[00:09:40] Tim, let's jump right into it.
[00:09:43] Your newest book, artificial intelligence and dominating deals with artificial intelligence
[00:09:48] through negotiating.
[00:09:49] So tell us about how AI is changing real estate negotiating.
[00:09:54] One of the most important parts about negotiating is establishing some kind of rapport with the
[00:09:59] other people.
[00:10:00] I really advocate collaborative negotiating and working together.
[00:10:04] If you're doing negotiating right, it's a communal puzzle solving.
[00:10:08] We are not adversaries.
[00:10:10] We're not enemies.
[00:10:11] We are counter parts.
[00:10:11] We're both parts of solving that puzzle.
[00:10:15] And to get to that mindset, you need to establish some kind of rapport.
[00:10:19] And one of the things that AI does particularly well is to give you information about the other person.
[00:10:26] And so it's so interesting.
[00:10:27] I love that.
[00:10:29] Yeah.
[00:10:29] So what I've got a super prompt that I use before I talk with almost anybody and find out something about them.
[00:10:36] The best illustration I can give you on how not to do this is a wonderful ad that all state is running now.
[00:10:44] Where this family is there, there are all of UNC people with the proper color of blue.
[00:10:50] And they're getting ready for this game and the daughter is having this boyfriend over for the first time.
[00:10:56] And he shows up at the front door in Duke, Jersey.
[00:10:59] Big adversary.
[00:11:00] They slam the door on him and throw him out.
[00:11:03] Well, there's a lot of REALTORS that start their negotiating process in a similar manner by being tough, confrontational and difficult.
[00:11:11] Instead, find out something which you've got in common.
[00:11:14] Establish some sort of rapport, get some kind of relationship going and then work on solving the problem.
[00:11:21] So I pass out this super prompt rather regularly if you want.
[00:11:26] If somebody wants a super prompt, all you do is send me an email with super prompt in the title.
[00:11:33] I'll be happy to send it to you and share it with you for free.
[00:11:36] And what's that email address?
[00:11:38] Yeah, it's Tim at TimBarell.com.
[00:11:41] And you can see that.
[00:11:42] And two ours and two Ls in Barell.
[00:11:44] Tim at TimBarell.com.
[00:11:46] We will have a link to that in the show notes.
[00:11:48] Super prompts are everything when it comes to AI.
[00:11:51] And most agents, I haven't really been taught what we call prompt engineering, which is how to write these incredible.
[00:11:57] And I just wrote a prompt for a friend of mine who wanted to do a marketing audit.
[00:12:02] And I had of course, AI write the prompt because what knows AI better than AI?
[00:12:07] And I am not kidding you.
[00:12:09] We took the prompt.
[00:12:10] I took the prompt and put it into a PDF because it was so long.
[00:12:13] It was 14 pages long was the actual prompt.
[00:12:17] Yeah.
[00:12:17] And I presented it to him and I said, copy.
[00:12:21] You know, he had to fill in a little bit of it.
[00:12:22] It wasn't entirely plug and play, but it was almost.
[00:12:26] And he was like, this is the biggest prompt I've ever seen.
[00:12:28] But it was doing an entire brand audit.
[00:12:30] And it was that intent.
[00:12:31] So yes, Tim has great prompts for you.
[00:12:35] Don't try to just write everything because a good prompt takes a while to write.
[00:12:38] It really does.
[00:12:40] And Tim's got some for you.
[00:12:42] So thank you.
[00:12:43] But the idea, let's get back to the idea first real quick.
[00:12:46] Because the idea is getting information about the person on the other side of the deal.
[00:12:52] What kind of information do you get when you end up running these prompts?
[00:12:56] Basically what I want to find out is something we have to come in.
[00:13:01] And something we can establish something.
[00:13:03] You know, for example, your kids both play soccer.
[00:13:06] You went to similar schools.
[00:13:07] You you root for the same teams.
[00:13:09] You have any kind of connection that you can put together.
[00:13:15] You have quite a bit of background in technology that's greatly exceeds mine.
[00:13:20] But I'm sort of fascinated by it.
[00:13:21] So you and I could could talk a few of those items to begin with.
[00:13:25] Now, you know, there's quite a bigger range of different information I get.
[00:13:31] But in the prompt, it gives me the other person's background, their education,
[00:13:36] their experience in terms of business.
[00:13:39] What things are important to them, certain other social aspects,
[00:13:42] goes through all their social media, highlights some of those things,
[00:13:46] looks for things in my social media, compares it to theirs.
[00:13:49] Mine's something we have in common.
[00:13:51] And then begin with that goes with that.
[00:13:54] That's also one of the things that you're exactly right in terms of teaching
[00:13:57] REALTORS about the values of prompts.
[00:13:59] Because in the end, negotiated book, I spend quite a bit of time going over,
[00:14:05] this is how you prompt.
[00:14:06] And then there is a appendix in there that has seven steps to get.
[00:14:12] A great prompt virtually every single time.
[00:14:14] You know, as you've done, start with the persona and then just work out of the way
[00:14:18] down on all the different other topics that can get and find it end up with
[00:14:23] detailed instructions on exactly what you want.
[00:14:26] Then once it comes out with something, then talk with it.
[00:14:30] Go back and reprompt.
[00:14:31] You know, that previous answer was pretty good.
[00:14:34] Well, what do you need for me in order to get me a 10 out of 10 answer?
[00:14:38] And then it'll tell you just how to prompt.
[00:14:40] Just like you were saying.
[00:14:41] Yeah.
[00:14:42] Who knows prompting better than AI?
[00:14:44] 
[00:14:44] Yeah.
[00:14:45] Tim, you know, I have to compliment you because this is really funny.
[00:14:49] So I didn't, this didn't occur to me until you were just telling me what kind of,
[00:14:52] when I said what kind of information you get, you said, well, I knew you had
[00:14:55] a technology background.
[00:14:56] It was funny as earlier, Tim and I were, we were, the software we're using,
[00:15:00] we were having a slight challenge and we were working out a problem.
[00:15:03] And then Tim said, yeah, you know, you have this technology background.
[00:15:05] And I thought, oh, he's just, he's saying that because I'm helping him with this
[00:15:09] particular challenge, I didn't realize that you had done research on me.
[00:15:13] And that's what you were referencing.
[00:15:15] And now that I know that, if we wouldn't have had that challenge,
[00:15:18] I wouldn't have thought of that.
[00:15:19] I would have gone, wow, this guy like did his research on me,
[00:15:22] which of course you are doing.
[00:15:24] And I just wanted to tell you that is a very flattering position,
[00:15:29] even though you do this for everyone that you're meeting with.
[00:15:32] It feels very, very affirming.
[00:15:36] It's like, wow, this person spent time to get to know me.
[00:15:40] And that is a report builder to the, I mean, that's what Dale Cardigey wrote,
[00:15:44] a hundred years ago, is find out, ask them about them or find out about them.
[00:15:48] And that is, you know, I was telling agents to do a version of this,
[00:15:51] you know, on the way to a showing.
[00:15:53] If you were going to a showing and you have never been there before it,
[00:15:56] I think maybe that's not the best way to do it.
[00:15:58] If you've never been to the property, maybe see if you can visit it ahead of time.
[00:16:01] But if you can't or even if you have throw in a prompt on the way there,
[00:16:05] tell me everything you know, chat, chat, GBT or clot or whoever about XYZ address.
[00:16:11] What, what would somebody who's looking to buy this place want to know?
[00:16:15] You know, what's, is there any cool history or trivia or facts about the area?
[00:16:19] Amenities, things like that, a buyer would want.
[00:16:21] And of course, you want to act, use a persona.
[00:16:24] So maybe as a travel guide, you could, you could use the persona or,
[00:16:27] or a top agent who's the number one listing agent in this area.
[00:16:31] What would they say about this property?
[00:16:33] What are some of the facts?
[00:16:34] And it's amazing.
[00:16:35] Like you said, you found out my background, which is amazing.
[00:16:37] I've never even run that for myself.
[00:16:40] And now I realize I need to do that for all of my guests.
[00:16:42] So you just gave me a great, but this, this is amazing.
[00:16:45] Because you can use this not just in negotiation.
[00:16:47] You could use it anytime you're going to, you know, maybe a showing
[00:16:51] and the other agent's going to be there, right?
[00:16:53] You could do this and you should do it.
[00:16:55] And you could say, hey, by the way, I know that we're both Cubs fans.
[00:16:58] Or I know that we've both been in the business 15 years or,
[00:17:00] or, or it seems like you do a lot of X, Y, or Z.
[00:17:04] Boy, I can't imagine how much good will that generates.
[00:17:08] Well, and so many people get off on the wrong foot, you know,
[00:17:11] you should come in the spit on their shoes and it's not going to,
[00:17:14] it's not going to work out after that.
[00:17:16] Now, particularly, you know, my style of negotiating is all collaborative.
[00:17:20] And what you need is a certain amount of trust.
[00:17:22] And you're not going to share information with the other person.
[00:17:25] If you can share information, find out what's important to them.
[00:17:27] And I find out what you know, I know what's important to me.
[00:17:31] Then we know what the key ingredients in the negotiation are.
[00:17:34] There is so much more breadth to negotiating than most people think.
[00:17:38] Almost everybody concentrates only on price.
[00:17:41] Sure.
[00:17:41] And if you can broaden that out, there are different trades that you can make up.
[00:17:45] The fancy word is asymmetry.
[00:17:48] What you're looking for is something that doesn't cost me much that I can give you.
[00:17:52] But you value incredibly highly.
[00:17:54] Well, if I give you that incredibly valuable thing for you,
[00:17:58] I can get something in return.
[00:18:01] And so, you know, as a result of this, you've got to start on the right foot to get that
[00:18:07] trust feeling.
[00:18:08] Because otherwise, if you share information with somebody who's not going to respond,
[00:18:12] who is not going to be trustworthy, who's not going to work with you,
[00:18:14] you're digging your own grave.
[00:18:16] You're giving them something they can use against you without getting something in return.
[00:18:22] If instead you can start on the right foot, the establishment of poor
[00:18:25] have a B so that everybody shares and everybody uses this for some kind of good result.
[00:18:31] You're going to come out with a completely different result.
[00:18:34] Negotiating is collaborating and is working together.
[00:18:37] And frankly, you know, we mentioned empathy at the very beginning.
[00:18:40] The biggest factor in negotiating is empathy.
[00:18:44] The Harvard Project and Negotiating has tremendous number of very esoteric books.
[00:18:48] For one of the best things I learned from them is each year,
[00:18:51] the interview of the person who has had the best result in some major negotiation.
[00:18:57] And the winner almost always left, they asked him what's the most important factor,
[00:19:01] and it's almost always empathy.
[00:19:03] So that's one of the things that we REALTORS excel at.
[00:19:06] We read people.
[00:19:07] We can have some feeling for who they are.
[00:19:10] Of course, it's important to them.
[00:19:11] And if we can utilize that empathy to understand, okay, what is it that they really want?
[00:19:16] As an example, after you and I hang out, I'm working with a gentleman who called me back.
[00:19:22] I fixed and flipped properties and he bought one.
[00:19:25] Well, he happened to inherit one.
[00:19:27] Unfortunately, his daughter diagnosed it's horrendous loss to him.
[00:19:31] But he's there and when we talked about he's looking at some of the online places where
[00:19:36] you can just sell it, but he says, I don't want to put it on the market.
[00:19:39] I don't want to deal with this property.
[00:19:40] I don't want to have to go back here anymore again.
[00:19:43] A lot of bad feelings, sure.
[00:19:44] Yeah.
[00:19:44] Yeah.
[00:19:45] He says, the thing I value about you is I can hand you the keys you're just going to take care of it.
[00:19:51] That's really important.
[00:19:53] And that factor in the negotiation, I need to get it used in price.
[00:19:57] And I need to make the flip work.
[00:20:00] But the value I can offer him is that particular non-monitorial value.
[00:20:04] And I can get something in return for that.
[00:20:07] So that's the best illustration that people need to understand
[00:20:11] negotiating is not just about one item.
[00:20:14] Negotiating has this huge breadth that you can utilize all kinds of different factors to succeed.
[00:20:20] And mostly emotion.
[00:20:22] There's more value in emotion in negotiating.
[00:20:25] You know, win more deals on emotions than you are on logic every day of the week.
[00:20:29] And if you know, I'm sure there's research on what we would call reciprocation, where we are
[00:20:35] providing some sort of value, whether it's a, hey, I know about you.
[00:20:39] I know about you as an individual, a human outside of this transaction,
[00:20:44] which is what your prompt helps find some commonality perhaps.
[00:20:48] Or just I know your background, I know your history, I know things about you,
[00:20:52] which again is very affirming.
[00:20:54] You know, people will, I would assume will offer favorable,
[00:20:59] favorable conditions to people they like.
[00:21:01] Right?
[00:21:01] So even if I assume it just not only does it obviously make the
[00:21:06] negotiation go more smoothly, but it probably helps in your favor, even if you're just
[00:21:13] building rapport because the person goes, I like this person.
[00:21:16] This person seems.
[00:21:17] 
[00:21:17] 
[00:21:18] 
[00:21:18] Robert, Robert Chaudin is writing several great books on influence.
[00:21:22] Yes.
[00:21:23] He's the master of persuasion and influence.
[00:21:25] Yeah.
[00:21:26] Exactly.
[00:21:26] And that's one of his biggest things is people will do things
[00:21:30] with other folks they like and trust.
[00:21:32] And they won't, unless you have this trust and rapport.
[00:21:35] So, you know, in the other part about doing the research, you know, like you're saying on a super
[00:21:40] prompt, as opposed in addition to studying the person, let's say you're going to go into a
[00:21:45] negotiation.
[00:21:46] Wouldn't it be really handy if you're playing poker, if you know what the other person's cards are?
[00:21:51] You can do something very similar to that using AI by studying the house and the other person's
[00:21:57] situation.
[00:21:57] Just do a whole bunch of research and you find out what cards they're holding.
[00:22:02] Okay, this person has a bunch of financial pressure.
[00:22:05] Therefore, and they're and needs to get this wrapped up quickly.
[00:22:09] Therefore, if I can offer a deal that closes eight, number one for sure,
[00:22:13] absolute certainty, but number two, quickly, then that's the value they're going to be looking for.
[00:22:19] So, if you before you start your negotiation, you do your research not only on the other
[00:22:23] party, the other wheelchair, but also on the personal owns of property and the house,
[00:22:28] then get that background to know what cards they're holding, then you know how to play the hand.
[00:22:34] And AI is a wonderful thing, you know, it's if it takes a bit of effort, it takes a while to learn.
[00:22:41] I'm glad you mentioned Claw, I really prefer that to a chat G-P-T.
[00:22:46] But there's a broad range of different AI tools that you can use.
[00:22:50] And frankly, that's another fun part.
[00:22:52] Ask AI, which is the best tool for which one item?
[00:22:55] And they'll tell you which one, the other tools they ought to be producing.
[00:22:57] We're for you to somebody who is their competition, but it works out particularly well.
[00:23:03] It is amazing how earnest AI seems to be, especially the Clawed's model.
[00:23:08] I've noticed that it seems to be fairly generous in talking about competitors in a helpful way.
[00:23:15] So yeah, I agree. But yeah, and Gemini now is apparently,
[00:23:19] is Star starting to beat chat G-P-T and its answers.
[00:23:22] So we're seeing all sorts of injuries.
[00:23:23] There used to be just chat G-P-T and now there's Clawed and I mean, you know, Grock is also one.
[00:23:29] And you pick one and you probably stick with it.
[00:23:31] But you know, you're right to say, we use it as a research machine.
[00:23:36] It's, I think most agents just think to use it as a listing description rewriter, which is fine.
[00:23:42] And it can be done, although I think I actually built a tool to help you do that better.
[00:23:47] It's totally free, listing.joincail.com.
[00:23:50] It will rewrite it seven different times from seven different personas, merge it together,
[00:23:54] everything from like a best-selling author to a journalist, to somebody who writes
[00:23:58] the trailers for movies, to a top 1% agent and it merges it together and it won't look like
[00:24:04] everyone else's. But again, you have to know how to write these prompts.
[00:24:07] And so this is what we're talking about.
[00:24:09] Yeah.
[00:24:10] I particularly liked that one because I tried it out and I've written something to,
[00:24:15] I've used some things to do mine and I tried yours.
[00:24:18] Oh, you did?
[00:24:18] Oh, did it work?
[00:24:19] Yeah.
[00:24:20] Yeah.
[00:24:20] Yeah, it was great.
[00:24:21] Now, but one thing, the one thing it's very interesting is if AI loves the word nestled,
[00:24:27] if you sit there, you're going to remove that.
[00:24:29] Well, we'll have it not use that.
[00:24:31] No, no, it's a very appealing word.
[00:24:34] But if you do a lot of AI work, you can sit there and look at other people's descriptions.
[00:24:39] If you see the word nestled, I'll use a little AI.
[00:24:42] Yeah.
[00:24:42] There's, you know, it's funny.
[00:24:43] I can follow that.
[00:24:45] I can follow that.
[00:24:45] Well, it's funny.
[00:24:46] You say the reason I said we're going to remove it is because I specifically have instructions
[00:24:50] in there not to use AI common speak.
[00:24:53] So that's one that it must have missed because we all know some of those,
[00:24:57] those phrases get used over and over again.
[00:24:59] And anyway, but, but so this is wonderful.
[00:25:02] So you've given two unbelievably great suggestions for our, our, our audience about specifically
[00:25:08] how to use AI and the AI and a go shader is the book way I'll have a link to that.
[00:25:14] And this has all sorts of prompting more importantly it teaches you how to build your own
[00:25:18] prompts.
[00:25:19] And what else tells more about the book?
[00:25:23] It came about just because I'm rather fascinated by the different breadth you can add to your
[00:25:29] own ability, you know, in developing an AI, you know, AI tools and add prompts.
[00:25:36] One of the other things is particularly handy in using AI is you can find out something about
[00:25:42] the other people's personality types.
[00:25:46] Say, you know, I use the DISC personality profiles to, to jerk it in different different ways
[00:25:51] to do anything.
[00:25:52] And if you're presenting something to a D, you want to hit three bullet points and that's about it.
[00:25:58] If you're presenting to somebody who's just see the, the engineer of CPA type,
[00:26:03] you want to give them a nauseating amount of detail, you know, something that, you know,
[00:26:07] I find nauseating, they find delightful.
[00:26:09] And so there's a number of, a number of different AI tools that you can use.
[00:26:15] I go through a wide range of different choices that you can use just to find out what personality
[00:26:21] type you're probably dealing with.
[00:26:23] And so then you know how to structure your pitch and structure your presentation.
[00:26:27] You know, if you're going to send an email and hope that the other agents just
[00:26:30] can afford it, if you're doing it to a D, just have a couple of good bullet points and those
[00:26:34] real high things, if it's going to be a C attached four pages of charts and graphs.
[00:26:40] And you know, there's, there's several different, different tools, AI,
[00:26:45] AI things that you can use in there.
[00:26:48] And the thing that's fun about writing a book on AI though is it changes so rapidly.
[00:26:52] You know, the book just came out.
[00:26:54] I'm probably going to have to rewrite it every six months.
[00:26:57] And, you know, go through updating and well, that's why the second book is coming out for investors.
[00:27:03] You know, I love this and I was just thinking you talk about the disk assessment.
[00:27:07] So disk set is a very common sort of personality type test to or just assessment to let somebody
[00:27:13] know kind of what how people make decisions, how they think, and it gives you some insight into
[00:27:19] what is going to work for them and how to.
[00:27:23] And so one thing I encourage are, you know, I never thought to do this.
[00:27:29] I'm a recruiter.
[00:27:30] I recruit real estate agents.
[00:27:31] I should be using this before I meet with any of my potential recruits instead of trying to figure
[00:27:36] out, are they a D and I, etc, etc. on the call.
[00:27:42] I need to, I can probably get a good sense.
[00:27:44] How accurate do you, do you find it to be for guessing what somebody's personality type is?
[00:27:49] Is it fairly accurate?
[00:27:51] Yeah, well, it'd be good.
[00:27:52] And you bring up the other thing about AI because it hallucinates.
[00:27:56] Sure.
[00:27:57] It's getting much better.
[00:27:59] When I first started in it, it hallucinated a lot.
[00:28:02] My best illustration is, you know, some attorneys would sit there and take a
[00:28:06] and let it right there and breathe for some minute.
[00:28:09] And yeah, it would cite a case that didn't exist.
[00:28:13] And my, my, my, yeah, my fiance's, she's a trial attorney and she was, would use it from time
[00:28:19] to time just to do research, say, hey, come up with some cases that fit this particular argument.
[00:28:24] And it would literally hallucinate cases that never happened.
[00:28:28] Yeah.
[00:28:29] 
[00:28:29] Yeah.
[00:28:30] So one of the things that I find is if you put it into one place, as example,
[00:28:34] the chat or Claude and run it through there and take and flip it over in a
[00:28:39] complexity and have it double checks it.
[00:28:41] The thing I like about perplexity is it gives you the sources.
[00:28:45] And so right in the, it's answer you can click on the sources.
[00:28:48] And for example, I, I, I used to be a trial lawyer.
[00:28:52] But one of the things that I don't, I don't practice law anymore.
[00:28:56] But every now and then there's something that I have to look up.
[00:28:59] But one of the things that I'll do is look it up in general and then go into
[00:29:03] perplexity and then occasionally if there's something that just doesn't quite feel right,
[00:29:07] you click on the source, it'll give you the case.
[00:29:11] So then I read the entire case and then I know that what I've got is accurate information
[00:29:15] before I open my mouth.
[00:29:16] This, this is also your biggest thing about establishing a poor
[00:29:19] in credibility is you do something that's completely wrong.
[00:29:24] You just lost it.
[00:29:26] You know, trust, trust is hard to establish and it's real easy to lose.
[00:29:30] And so this is one of the things about a, as you've had a double check it before you,
[00:29:34] you know, if you're just taking copy it and paste it and spit it out,
[00:29:38] there's a decent chance that there's going to be something wrong.
[00:29:41] Now, that's not horrendous.
[00:29:43] Every one of us makes mistakes.
[00:29:45] I mean, you're never going to talk to somebody who is never going to make a mistake,
[00:29:47] who's never going to say something wrong.
[00:29:49] So, you know, that's normal.
[00:29:51] So it's not that we're lots of people who call this,
[00:29:53] this AI is this horrible tool because it makes mistakes.
[00:29:57] Yeah, don't we all?
[00:29:59] And so if you just adapt to that, to the fact that it's not perfect and double check before
[00:30:03] you spit it out, you're going to be fine.
[00:30:07] I couldn't agree with you more.
[00:30:09] And so one thing that I've done with AI,
[00:30:12] I assume you've probably done the same, is AI is very often,
[00:30:17] and maybe it's getting better, but it was very,
[00:30:21] I've noticed it would flatter me a lot,
[00:30:23] and it would tell me that all every idea I had was a brilliant idea.
[00:30:27] And when many of them weren't so brilliant,
[00:30:30] and it would tell me that any business sort of venture I was thinking about
[00:30:34] to going into was great.
[00:30:36] And I would go down these rabbit holes of like, wow, AI is on my side.
[00:30:39] It really thinks there's an opportunity here.
[00:30:41] And I have learned to, I have instructed it to not do that.
[00:30:45] And tell me what it's actual, you know,
[00:30:48] it's actual assessment of maybe an idea I have, or, you know,
[00:30:52] I'm working on a CRM right now that I'm kind of building from scratch.
[00:30:56] And I'm having it go through and say, let's go through the sales process.
[00:31:00] Is my sales process sound?
[00:31:01] Where do I have holes?
[00:31:03] Do not just tell me it's great.
[00:31:04] Look for holes, look for challenges.
[00:31:06] So I imagine you've probably instructed yours to do something similar.
[00:31:09] Yeah, actually that's something I need to do more.
[00:31:12] And frankly, I've learned something by being here,
[00:31:14] because I just sit there and try to ignore it.
[00:31:18] But instead, instead, if I just said, we don't need flattery,
[00:31:22] we need accurate, unbarnished facts.
[00:31:25] If it's something really stupid, put capital letters,
[00:31:29] S-T-U-P-I-D, you know, I want to know, as opposed to,
[00:31:33] oh, yes, I agree, I agree.
[00:31:35] No, no, no, it's like having a non-friend.
[00:31:37] You know, somebody who always agrees with you,
[00:31:39] somebody always who will, you know,
[00:31:41] no, you want to have something, because, you know,
[00:31:44] a real discourse and the difference of opinion
[00:31:46] and a different relationship that you can have.
[00:31:49] And, yeah, frankly, I haven't gone in and been instructed.
[00:31:51] I try to just myself overcome it and ignore it.
[00:31:54] I think you got a better idea.
[00:31:56] I know that just why it's different from just like,
[00:31:58] you know, you know, you have a name for your, for your,
[00:32:03] AI.
[00:32:03] And so I want to go in and give it more instruction saying,
[00:32:06] okay, one more thing you need to know about me,
[00:32:08] no flattery.
[00:32:10] You know, if, if I need to hear something unvarnished,
[00:32:13] you need to spit it out before I learn it the hard way.
[00:32:16] With, with chat, GPT, I have it,
[00:32:19] some, some engineer had written this long prompt
[00:32:22] to put into its permanent memory.
[00:32:24] Claude, I don't think works exactly the same way.
[00:32:26] I'd have to see if how to do this with Claude.
[00:32:28] But chat, GPT does have this and it's permanent memory for, you know,
[00:32:32] as a user, where you can, I have it now, give me a,
[00:32:36] an assessment at the end of the answer to say,
[00:32:39] how confident are, are they in this answer?
[00:32:43] And it is only able, you know,
[00:32:45] assuming it's following orders to tell me the truth
[00:32:48] and it will give me a flag, a, what they call a confidence flag.
[00:32:51] And it will say, hey, we think this is it,
[00:32:53] but don't take our word for it.
[00:32:55] Look, you know, and that really helps.
[00:32:57] And so I see some update to, to any of your AI books
[00:33:01] is a chapter on how to sort of tame AI and train it to,
[00:33:05] to be super honest and forthright and more objective versus subjective.
[00:33:11] So I see, I see that as a, a good thing is let's, let's prime,
[00:33:16] let's prime a not to just be our friend because it's really not our friend.
[00:33:20] It's just, it's a tool.
[00:33:21] It's a tool.
[00:33:22] Yeah.
[00:33:23] So and great, you know, thank goodness I haven't published a second book yet.
[00:33:26] I've got to go back to do a little rewrite on the chapter.
[00:33:28] So well, I love this and AI really does, you know,
[00:33:33] what is it done for your business as far as, you know,
[00:33:37] how much time has it saved you?
[00:33:38] How much more effective has it made you?
[00:33:41] It's dramatic.
[00:33:42] Now, you know, I've been in business a long time and I've gone sort of big career.
[00:33:46] I used to run a large team and I don't think.
[00:33:49] And so this is much more effective for me just to be able to do a whole lot of other things
[00:33:56] quickly and repetitive repetitive tasks.
[00:33:59] It's accepted.
[00:33:59] The way something where it's supposed to check this, that and the other
[00:34:03] and give you flags and alerts when you're not on schedule.
[00:34:06] That's one of the other things that you can use very effectively
[00:34:09] and negotiate or it was after you have put a deal together.
[00:34:13] It'll sit there and walk you through and keep you on track and make sure that you don't miss deadlines.
[00:34:19] Don't miss other things.
[00:34:20] And there's a lot of others off for that to do that.
[00:34:23] But it really has decreased the number of people I needed to have on my team.
[00:34:27] And the AI is not particularly expensive.
[00:34:30] The other people on my team, they cost a little bit now.
[00:34:36] And frankly, they made more mistakes than AI does.
[00:34:38] So this is greatly improved my ability to perform more effectively with the people that I like.
[00:34:46] Now, with negotiating with AI, my first thought was around what price should I offer.
[00:34:52] Are you relying on or are you using AI to help guide you in pricing strategy?
[00:35:00] Fandos, because what you can do is take an AI,
[00:35:06] cloud works better, Chatton will do this fairly well.
[00:35:08] But go in there and say, okay, this is their situation.
[00:35:11] Here's my situation.
[00:35:12] This is what I'm going to offer for the high probability of the outcome.
[00:35:16] What do you think their response is going to be?
[00:35:20] Because one of the things you're anchoring is a big effect in negotiating.
[00:35:25] If you have an initial point that you start lower, you're going to end up lower.
[00:35:29] For example, I'm trying to buy something.
[00:35:31] If I can get a persuasive number that people will give some respect to that is low,
[00:35:37] the studies show that we're going to end up at a lower price than so I'm going to do.
[00:35:40] But however, there's also a point where if you go way too low, it's insulting.
[00:35:46] And you're not going to end up better.
[00:35:47] They're going to make you apologize.
[00:35:49] And so instead of trying that out real life and running up the flag call and see what they do,
[00:35:55] go ahead and put it into AI.
[00:35:57] So take your offer and say, ask it for what's the most probable response.
[00:36:01] The other thing you can do is ask it for three different probable responses.
[00:36:06] So you can, as opposed to, you know, there's a whole lot of negotiations where at the very end,
[00:36:10] you look back and say, oh, God, I should have done this.
[00:36:13] Why didn't I think of that?
[00:36:14] Well, this way you can do it beforehand.
[00:36:17] It'll let you think of that before you have ruined the, you know, the relationship.
[00:36:22] And it'll give you some feedback in terms of should you do this or should you not do this.
[00:36:26] But yeah, it's really good on, just go ahead and roll play.
[00:36:31] And you practice it with them and it'll give you a response.
[00:36:33] It'll give you the probabilities of success or the probabilities of really making them mad.
[00:36:39] You know, you have given so many great reasons to why to use AI for negotiating.
[00:36:45] We talked about preparing for the negotiation, learning about the person on the other side,
[00:36:49] maybe learning about the deal, the property, the situation, building rapport,
[00:36:54] utilizing AI to get some commonality because we know like a tends to favor like and
[00:37:00] those negotiations tend to go more smoothly and possibly better for your side.
[00:37:05] And also winning from the start, you know, I know was also something is just, you know,
[00:37:09] crafting offers, knowing something about that personality type or the type of, you know,
[00:37:13] situation we're dealing with.
[00:37:15] Well, the thing we didn't talk about, which I know is in your book that I just want to spend a
[00:37:19] moment on because I think this is this is kind of blowing my mind, is real time coaching.
[00:37:24] So this idea that during the negotiation, you have this kind of real time coach to kind of guide
[00:37:30] you through, okay, now this is happening and do this. Can you speak just for a moment on that?
[00:37:35] Yeah, there's a number of AI apps that will sit there and analyze the interaction.
[00:37:41] For example, we'll read their emails and read their discussions and we'll flag certain things
[00:37:45] where it'll notice a change in the tone and make the change in the attitude and flag that these
[00:37:52] people are getting mad. Or, you know, so you're losing it and it'll give you a heads up.
[00:37:59] Autor, a lot of people use Autor just to record, you know, what's happening, you know, say you're
[00:38:03] on a meeting and you use Autor to do it. Well, one of the functions it has is it will give you a flag
[00:38:09] this saying, you're going off the rails here. That was something who's not going well.
[00:38:14] Now, I don't use it that much. One of the things I actually, you know, I like to point out things in
[00:38:22] my books that aren't something that I use, but it shouldn't be me who decides for the reader what
[00:38:27] it is that's best for them. You know, they need to know what's complete amount or what's available.
[00:38:32] I don't use those things that much because they distract me. I really like to focus on the people
[00:38:38] and really actively listen, you know, take a lot of effort on the listening, repeat that what
[00:38:44] they're saying, ask them again, you know, further depth of the question of why that's important
[00:38:49] with them and if we do that, what will that do for them, things of that nature. And so I've,
[00:38:54] on infill cases, I've tried it, but my own personal preference is to use my own judgment of,
[00:39:00] I hope that feedback is supposed to be AI's judgment. If people didn't get better, you know,
[00:39:06] and if you don't have the 45 year career with law and real estate that you have, you can,
[00:39:13] you can utilize AI to help give you some of that wisdom that it can find online. So yes, you
[00:39:20] have this amazing real life experience that you can draw from that you are very confident in.
[00:39:25] And for all of everyone else out there who's maybe new to the business, use AI for this sort of
[00:39:30] thing, especially, and I know this is also in your book, and this is, I think, incredibly valuable,
[00:39:35] which is handling conflict. How do you actually deal? Because conflict we know is part of every
[00:39:40] negotiation. It's built into the process and it is the most important part of relationships is
[00:39:45] handling, resolving conflict and AI can really help you. Can you speak for a moment on conflict?
[00:39:52] Yeah, frankly, one of my best tools on, one of my best tools on conflict is frankly getting old
[00:39:59] enough to where you're comfortable in your skin and you don't always have to be right. And one
[00:40:04] of the simplest ways to get the conflict to be over is everybody is sitting there. See, you don't
[00:40:10] want to let negotiating get into a situation. Well, I need to win this one. I got to win this one.
[00:40:14] I got to win this one. You've got this puzzle that you have to accomplish and you have to put
[00:40:18] all together. And so when you do find the conflict and when you can find something, you know,
[00:40:27] I've one of my best tools, frankly, is to apologize. And most people think that's nuts,
[00:40:33] you know, because you're showing weakness. No, you're not. You're showing strength. You're
[00:40:37] showing the ability to recognize that there is something you could have done better. So if you
[00:40:41] back off a little bit and you apologize and indicate that there was something that you are part
[00:40:46] of the problem that I created part of this issue. And maybe I could have done better ahead. We
[00:40:51] done this. If you change the whole attitude where you show some humanity and offer that humanity,
[00:40:58] you mentioned us across the earlier, but you're going to get some reciprocity back by just,
[00:41:04] you know, not having this pound, pound, pound, you know, attack attack attack attitude. If instead,
[00:41:10] it's we're working together here and collectively smarter than we are individually.
[00:41:15] So if you find something that you know, can justifyably, you know, apologize, maybe too strong
[00:41:23] the word, but if you can indicate that you recognize that you were part of the problem and that
[00:41:27] there's a better way that we could have done it. And I want to offer this as a better solution
[00:41:32] than what we've done before. That really helps. And the AI can point out a lot of the different
[00:41:39] possibilities and a lot of the different bits of information that you can use to reestablish
[00:41:44] that before. Now, as you should before, it will it will point out a lot of the things where things
[00:41:50] are going on, you know, the real time coaching. And then you have to be smart enough to figure out,
[00:41:54] okay, now that we've gotten into this mess, how do we get out of this mess? AI will give you a lot
[00:41:59] of data, but you've got to negotiate in some art. The event I have to art form under your belt and
[00:42:05] the ability to figure out, okay, this is where we are. This is not where we want to be. What are we
[00:42:14] trying to do? That's where the art of negotiate. Well, that's why I make a few dollars off of
[00:42:19] being the negotiating consultant. People will frequently get themselves in their own mess and I'll
[00:42:23] help them get out of it. But you know, same concept. When you get into conflict, you need to have the
[00:42:28] tools. And AI will give you some of the tools, but then you also have some of the training and some
[00:42:33] of that empathy and some of that gut feeling to be big enough to say, you know, I could have done
[00:42:39] better and if you start saying you could have done better and you want to offer some
[00:42:45] correction to what you've done, the other person will reciprocate you'll both get back on track.
[00:42:50] Yeah. And taking accountability is huge. And I found I couldn't believe as I got older into
[00:42:56] adulthood, how many adults found it seem seemingly challenging to say I'm sorry. A cell for the
[00:43:03] ones that do, oh boy, we love people that say they're sorry, don't we? Negotiationconsultant.com
[00:43:09] is the website. I want everybody I think Tim has made an incredible case to purchase this book.
[00:43:16] The AI negotiator dominate real estate deals with the power of artificial intelligence. I mean,
[00:43:21] just in this tax, the tips and tactics you've provided during this conversation, I have just been
[00:43:27] so impressed and Tim really knows his stuff and he has a lot of real world experience to as well
[00:43:33] to throw in to really help you navigate AI to make sure you're utilizing it correctly and not
[00:43:37] over relying upon it to make sure that you're holding it accountable for some clarity and some
[00:43:44] objective empirical information versus sometimes the hallucinations that we've experienced with it.
[00:43:50] But the AI negotiator will get you through negotiations so that it does truly become collaborative
[00:43:56] and resolves conflict and really just helps guide you from literally the beginning to the end.
[00:44:01] Not just price, not just on resolving the end part, but literally before starting,
[00:44:06] it actually gives you information that there's be very difficult for somebody to get ahead of time
[00:44:11] without artificial intelligence. So Tim, I love this idea. I think this is a brilliant idea and book
[00:44:17] and I really want our audience to pick it up. You can find it anywhere, you can find anywhere online,
[00:44:22] of course, but you can actually order it directly from Negotiatingconsultant.com. There's a link
[00:44:26] there. You can go to Amazon. It's there. It's got great reviews and I'm excited for version two
[00:44:31] that will come out later, but get this version now because very few agents are using it for
[00:44:37] negotiations. They're still just throwing it in for listing descriptions or getting information
[00:44:41] about a property. They're not really getting going as deep as Tim goes with you and this will give
[00:44:45] you a huge leg up. So Negotiating, Negotiatingconsultant.com is the website and AI negotiator is the book
[00:44:52] Find It on Amazon and on behalf of all of our audience, Tim, thank you for your time. Thank you for
[00:44:58] your 45 years of experience, bring that to our audience. We appreciate it. And if you're an agent
[00:45:04] that is not in the Raleigh area and you are interested and you have people that move to Raleigh,
[00:45:10] give Tim a call. He might be a good referral source for you and vice versa. If you have people
[00:45:14] that come from Raleigh, maybe they move down further south, although Raleigh is a pretty great
[00:45:18] place to stay all year round. But if they if you are one of those places where that's a feeder market,
[00:45:22] you know, reach out to Tim. He might be able to have some great referrals for you as well. Tim,
[00:45:26] thank you. Also, we're going to have a link to your email. We're going to send you can send out
[00:45:31] that super prompt as an as an example for everyone. We appreciate you. That was in the show notes.
[00:45:36] On behalf of everyone, thank you on behalf of Tim and myself. Thank you for sticking around to the
[00:45:41] end of the episode. Thank you for for being one of our lovely listeners and also please tell a friend.
[00:45:46] Think of one other agent that needs to hear this, which is every agent right now. So anyone in your
[00:45:51] office that does isn't currently a listener, please let them know about our show really helps us out.
[00:45:56] And we we appreciate you thanks to our sponsors. And we will see everybody on the next episode. Thanks, Tim.
[00:46:03] Thank you. Really enjoyed it.

So thank you on behalf of all of us for an amazing 2025. We're excited to do even some more creatively different things in 2026. We're not staying straight from our existing formula, but we are adding on some cool ideas. And I'm in some talks with some companies right now to do some really fun stuff. So I'm hopeful to bring that news to you shortly. All right, let's get right to it. My conversation with Tim Barat. Past advice you've received in real estate. A bee authentic. Don't try to be somebody else. Don't try to copy somebody else's program. Be authentic. Just have be your real self and have empathy for the people that you're working with. Because it's that connection that you'll establish with your clients that will prove your worth. Authenticity. I like it. And empathy. That's what I'm hearing. Now worst advice you've received in real estate. Prospect like crazy and try to work with absolutely everybody. The thing that is delightful about getting a little bit older is I only work with people I like. And it makes a huge difference because do you really want referrals from people that you can't stand because they're going to refer you people just like them. You'll get more people you can't stand. So select who you want to work with. So be willing to walk away. Oh yes. And sometimes it's just delightful moments when you fire a client. It's just has a great feeling of, you know, there's some people that I really enjoy what I do. I really like to help people get into houses and it just makes me feel absolutely fabulous when I've personally I take a lot of people that otherwise can't get into a home and folks that buy houses are 40 times wealthier than people that don't buy houses. I look where they'll work with a lot of people that are not being facilitated by the real estate community. To me that is huge. But you know, the thing that really does, you know, does my heart good these things to that nature. So, you know, taking people to deserve it and work with the people that deserve it and use all of your greatest efforts and all your empathy to do the absolute best you can. And don't let the, don't let the bombs work you down. I love it. And since we haven't introduced you yet, so I'm about to, but I'm going to throw one at you that you did not know is coming because you have 45 years of experience here. And I would like to ask you one last question. If you could give advice to your youngest, your younger self, maybe 45 years ago, starting in real estate, what would you, what would you say to yourself? Invest in real estate earlier. You know, I do a tremendous amount of work to get other people real estate in homes and investments. And the thing that would have been smarter if I'd started investing in the product that I know so well, even earlier in my life. I love it. Tim Burrell is our guest and he is an amazing, amazing person. He's a triple threat. He's, by the way, Tim Burrell is with RE/MAX United. He's in California. You are all over, but mostly Orange County, County area, is that accurate? Once upon a time, I was in palace 30s. I've sighted a lot of sandals. I still have a lot of friends there. But for a brief time, I had a real estate team in palace, where he's at the same time, I had a real estate team in Raleigh. Currently, I'm just in Raleigh and do a large amount of work and anything that touches Wake County, which is the capital county in North Carolina. Oh, my goodness. I am so sorry. I thought you were West for some reason. I thought you were Orange County. Maybe I was looking at the RE/MAX United and maybe that's headquarter is there for some reason. So North Carolina, that is amazing. So Tim Burrell is our guest. He is a rare triple threat and he is a licensed REALTOR. He's an attorney and he's a general contractor. I mean, it's really an amazing set of skills. There are 45 years experience hands on turning complex deals in the profitable outcomes. He's graduate of UCLA School of Law and inductee into the prestigious RE/MAX Hall of Fame. He's channeled that hard one expertise into three must read books on negotiating, create a great deal, the art of real estate negotiating, and his newest one, which I'm most excited about the AI negotiator. We're going to be talking about that here. And soon to be published another book, his fourth book coming is called AI real estate investing, practical guides that show agents and investors how to leverage both timeless negotiating principles and cutting edge artificial intelligence to gain a decisive competitive edge. I want everybody to go pick up the AI negotiator. It's called dominate real estate deals with the power of artificial intelligence. That is available on Amazon. We will have a link to that on the show notes. And I want also everybody to check out Tim in all of the things he does. He does negotiation, consulting. He will help you with continuing education. And you want to go to negotiation consult negotiation, negotiate consultant.com. Tim, I just want to make sure I got that right. Actually, it's negotiating consultant.com. I apologize. I apologize. We have negotiating consult. We will have that link in the show notes. You don't have to type it in. Don't listen to me. And just click away. And check out Tim. He is the real deal. Tim, let's jump right into it. Your newest book, artificial intelligence and dominating deals with artificial intelligence through negotiating. So tell us about how AI is changing real estate negotiating. One of the most important parts about negotiating is establishing some kind of rapport with the other people. I really advocate collaborative negotiating and working together. If you're doing negotiating right, it's a communal puzzle solving. We are not adversaries. We're not enemies. We are counter parts. We're both parts of solving that puzzle. And to get to that mindset, you need to establish some kind of rapport. And one of the things that AI does particularly well is to give you information about the other person. And so it's so interesting. I love that. Yeah. So what I've got a super prompt that I use before I talk with almost anybody and find out something about them. The best illustration I can give you on how not to do this is a wonderful ad that all state is running now. Where this family is there, there are all of UNC people with the proper color of blue. And they're getting ready for this game and the daughter is having this boyfriend over for the first time. And he shows up at the front door in Duke, Jersey. Big adversary. They slam the door on him and throw him out. Well, there's a lot of REALTORS that start their negotiating process in a similar manner by being tough, confrontational and difficult. Instead, find out something which you've got in common. Establish some sort of rapport, get some kind of relationship going and then work on solving the problem. So I pass out this super prompt rather regularly if you want. If somebody wants a super prompt, all you do is send me an email with super prompt in the title. I'll be happy to send it to you and share it with you for free. And what's that email address? Yeah, it's Tim at TimBarell.com. And you can see that. And two ours and two Ls in Barell. Tim at TimBarell.com. We will have a link to that in the show notes. Super prompts are everything when it comes to AI. And most agents, I haven't really been taught what we call prompt engineering, which is how to write these incredible. And I just wrote a prompt for a friend of mine who wanted to do a marketing audit. And I had of course, AI write the prompt because what knows AI better than AI? And I am not kidding you. We took the prompt. I took the prompt and put it into a PDF because it was so long. It was 14 pages long was the actual prompt. Yeah. And I presented it to him and I said, copy. You know, he had to fill in a little bit of it. It wasn't entirely plug and play, but it was almost. And he was like, this is the biggest prompt I've ever seen. But it was doing an entire brand audit. And it was that intent. So yes, Tim has great prompts for you. Don't try to just write everything because a good prompt takes a while to write. It really does. And Tim's got some for you. So thank you. But the idea, let's get back to the idea first real quick. Because the idea is getting information about the person on the other side of the deal. What kind of information do you get when you end up running these prompts? Basically what I want to find out is something we have to come in. And something we can establish something. You know, for example, your kids both play soccer. You went to similar schools. You you root for the same teams. You have any kind of connection that you can put together. You have quite a bit of background in technology that's greatly exceeds mine. But I'm sort of fascinated by it. So you and I could could talk a few of those items to begin with. Now, you know, there's quite a bigger range of different information I get. But in the prompt, it gives me the other person's background, their education, their experience in terms of business. What things are important to them, certain other social aspects, goes through all their social media, highlights some of those things, looks for things in my social media, compares it to theirs. Mine's something we have in common. And then begin with that goes with that. That's also one of the things that you're exactly right in terms of teaching REALTORS about the values of prompts. Because in the end, negotiated book, I spend quite a bit of time going over, this is how you prompt. And then there is a appendix in there that has seven steps to get. A great prompt virtually every single time. You know, as you've done, start with the persona and then just work out of the way down on all the different other topics that can get and find it end up with detailed instructions on exactly what you want. Then once it comes out with something, then talk with it. Go back and reprompt. You know, that previous answer was pretty good. Well, what do you need for me in order to get me a 10 out of 10 answer? And then it'll tell you just how to prompt. Just like you were saying. Yeah. Who knows prompting better than AI? Yeah. Tim, you know, I have to compliment you because this is really funny. So I didn't, this didn't occur to me until you were just telling me what kind of, when I said what kind of information you get, you said, well, I knew you had a technology background. It was funny as earlier, Tim and I were, we were, the software we're using, we were having a slight challenge and we were working out a problem. And then Tim said, yeah, you know, you have this technology background. And I thought, oh, he's just, he's saying that because I'm helping him with this particular challenge, I didn't realize that you had done research on me. And that's what you were referencing. And now that I know that, if we wouldn't have had that challenge, I wouldn't have thought of that. I would have gone, wow, this guy like did his research on me, which of course you are doing. And I just wanted to tell you that is a very flattering position, even though you do this for everyone that you're meeting with. It feels very, very affirming. It's like, wow, this person spent time to get to know me. And that is a report builder to the, I mean, that's what Dale Cardigey wrote, a hundred years ago, is find out, ask them about them or find out about them. And that is, you know, I was telling agents to do a version of this, you know, on the way to a showing. If you were going to a showing and you have never been there before it, I think maybe that's not the best way to do it. If you've never been to the property, maybe see if you can visit it ahead of time. But if you can't or even if you have throw in a prompt on the way there, tell me everything you know, chat, chat, GBT or clot or whoever about XYZ address. What, what would somebody who's looking to buy this place want to know? You know, what's, is there any cool history or trivia or facts about the area? Amenities, things like that, a buyer would want. And of course, you want to act, use a persona. So maybe as a travel guide, you could, you could use the persona or, or a top agent who's the number one listing agent in this area. What would they say about this property? What are some of the facts? And it's amazing. Like you said, you found out my background, which is amazing. I've never even run that for myself. And now I realize I need to do that for all of my guests. So you just gave me a great, but this, this is amazing. Because you can use this not just in negotiation. You could use it anytime you're going to, you know, maybe a showing and the other agent's going to be there, right? You could do this and you should do it. And you could say, hey, by the way, I know that we're both Cubs fans. Or I know that we've both been in the business 15 years or, or, or it seems like you do a lot of X, Y, or Z. Boy, I can't imagine how much good will that generates. Well, and so many people get off on the wrong foot, you know, you should come in the spit on their shoes and it's not going to, it's not going to work out after that. Now, particularly, you know, my style of negotiating is all collaborative. And what you need is a certain amount of trust. And you're not going to share information with the other person. If you can share information, find out what's important to them. And I find out what you know, I know what's important to me. Then we know what the key ingredients in the negotiation are. There is so much more breadth to negotiating than most people think. Almost everybody concentrates only on price. Sure. And if you can broaden that out, there are different trades that you can make up. The fancy word is asymmetry. What you're looking for is something that doesn't cost me much that I can give you. But you value incredibly highly. Well, if I give you that incredibly valuable thing for you, I can get something in return. And so, you know, as a result of this, you've got to start on the right foot to get that trust feeling. Because otherwise, if you share information with somebody who's not going to respond, who is not going to be trustworthy, who's not going to work with you, you're digging your own grave. You're giving them something they can use against you without getting something in return. If instead you can start on the right foot, the establishment of poor have a B so that everybody shares and everybody uses this for some kind of good result. You're going to come out with a completely different result. Negotiating is collaborating and is working together. And frankly, you know, we mentioned empathy at the very beginning. The biggest factor in negotiating is empathy. The Harvard Project and Negotiating has tremendous number of very esoteric books. For one of the best things I learned from them is each year, the interview of the person who has had the best result in some major negotiation. And the winner almost always left, they asked him what's the most important factor, and it's almost always empathy. So that's one of the things that we REALTORS excel at. We read people. We can have some feeling for who they are. Of course, it's important to them. And if we can utilize that empathy to understand, okay, what is it that they really want? As an example, after you and I hang out, I'm working with a gentleman who called me back. I fixed and flipped properties and he bought one. Well, he happened to inherit one. Unfortunately, his daughter diagnosed it's horrendous loss to him. But he's there and when we talked about he's looking at some of the online places where you can just sell it, but he says, I don't want to put it on the market. I don't want to deal with this property. I don't want to have to go back here anymore again. A lot of bad feelings, sure. Yeah. Yeah. He says, the thing I value about you is I can hand you the keys you're just going to take care of it. That's really important. And that factor in the negotiation, I need to get it used in price. And I need to make the flip work. But the value I can offer him is that particular non-monitorial value. And I can get something in return for that. So that's the best illustration that people need to understand negotiating is not just about one item. Negotiating has this huge breadth that you can utilize all kinds of different factors to succeed. And mostly emotion. There's more value in emotion in negotiating. You know, win more deals on emotions than you are on logic every day of the week. And if you know, I'm sure there's research on what we would call reciprocation, where we are providing some sort of value, whether it's a, hey, I know about you. I know about you as an individual, a human outside of this transaction, which is what your prompt helps find some commonality perhaps. Or just I know your background, I know your history, I know things about you, which again is very affirming. You know, people will, I would assume will offer favorable, favorable conditions to people they like. Right? So even if I assume it just not only does it obviously make the negotiation go more smoothly, but it probably helps in your favor, even if you're just building rapport because the person goes, I like this person. This person seems. Robert, Robert Chaudin is writing several great books on influence. Yes. He's the master of persuasion and influence. Yeah. Exactly. And that's one of his biggest things is people will do things with other folks they like and trust. And they won't, unless you have this trust and rapport. So, you know, in the other part about doing the research, you know, like you're saying on a super prompt, as opposed in addition to studying the person, let's say you're going to go into a negotiation. Wouldn't it be really handy if you're playing poker, if you know what the other person's cards are? You can do something very similar to that using AI by studying the house and the other person's situation. Just do a whole bunch of research and you find out what cards they're holding. Okay, this person has a bunch of financial pressure. Therefore, and they're and needs to get this wrapped up quickly. Therefore, if I can offer a deal that closes eight, number one for sure, absolute certainty, but number two, quickly, then that's the value they're going to be looking for. So, if you before you start your negotiation, you do your research not only on the other party, the other wheelchair, but also on the personal owns of property and the house, then get that background to know what cards they're holding, then you know how to play the hand. And AI is a wonderful thing, you know, it's if it takes a bit of effort, it takes a while to learn. I'm glad you mentioned Claw, I really prefer that to a chat G-P-T. But there's a broad range of different AI tools that you can use. And frankly, that's another fun part. Ask AI, which is the best tool for which one item? And they'll tell you which one, the other tools they ought to be producing. We're for you to somebody who is their competition, but it works out particularly well. It is amazing how earnest AI seems to be, especially the Clawed's model. I've noticed that it seems to be fairly generous in talking about competitors in a helpful way. So yeah, I agree. But yeah, and Gemini now is apparently, is Star starting to beat chat G-P-T and its answers. So we're seeing all sorts of injuries. There used to be just chat G-P-T and now there's Clawed and I mean, you know, Grock is also one. And you pick one and you probably stick with it. But you know, you're right to say, we use it as a research machine. It's, I think most agents just think to use it as a listing description rewriter, which is fine. And it can be done, although I think I actually built a tool to help you do that better. It's totally free, listing.joincail.com. It will rewrite it seven different times from seven different personas, merge it together, everything from like a best-selling author to a journalist, to somebody who writes the trailers for movies, to a top 1% agent and it merges it together and it won't look like everyone else's. But again, you have to know how to write these prompts. And so this is what we're talking about. Yeah. I particularly liked that one because I tried it out and I've written something to, I've used some things to do mine and I tried yours. Oh, you did? Oh, did it work? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, it was great. Now, but one thing, the one thing it's very interesting is if AI loves the word nestled, if you sit there, you're going to remove that. Well, we'll have it not use that. No, no, it's a very appealing word. But if you do a lot of AI work, you can sit there and look at other people's descriptions. If you see the word nestled, I'll use a little AI. Yeah. There's, you know, it's funny. I can follow that. I can follow that. Well, it's funny. You say the reason I said we're going to remove it is because I specifically have instructions in there not to use AI common speak. So that's one that it must have missed because we all know some of those, those phrases get used over and over again. And anyway, but, but so this is wonderful. So you've given two unbelievably great suggestions for our, our, our audience about specifically how to use AI and the AI and a go shader is the book way I'll have a link to that. And this has all sorts of prompting more importantly it teaches you how to build your own prompts. And what else tells more about the book? It came about just because I'm rather fascinated by the different breadth you can add to your own ability, you know, in developing an AI, you know, AI tools and add prompts. One of the other things is particularly handy in using AI is you can find out something about the other people's personality types. Say, you know, I use the DISC personality profiles to, to jerk it in different different ways to do anything. And if you're presenting something to a D, you want to hit three bullet points and that's about it. If you're presenting to somebody who's just see the, the engineer of CPA type, you want to give them a nauseating amount of detail, you know, something that, you know, I find nauseating, they find delightful. And so there's a number of, a number of different AI tools that you can use. I go through a wide range of different choices that you can use just to find out what personality type you're probably dealing with. And so then you know how to structure your pitch and structure your presentation. You know, if you're going to send an email and hope that the other agents just can afford it, if you're doing it to a D, just have a couple of good bullet points and those real high things, if it's going to be a C attached four pages of charts and graphs. And you know, there's, there's several different, different tools, AI, AI things that you can use in there. And the thing that's fun about writing a book on AI though is it changes so rapidly. You know, the book just came out. I'm probably going to have to rewrite it every six months. And, you know, go through updating and well, that's why the second book is coming out for investors. You know, I love this and I was just thinking you talk about the disk assessment. So disk set is a very common sort of personality type test to or just assessment to let somebody know kind of what how people make decisions, how they think, and it gives you some insight into what is going to work for them and how to. And so one thing I encourage are, you know, I never thought to do this. I'm a recruiter. I recruit real estate agents. I should be using this before I meet with any of my potential recruits instead of trying to figure out, are they a D and I, etc, etc. on the call. I need to, I can probably get a good sense. How accurate do you, do you find it to be for guessing what somebody's personality type is? Is it fairly accurate? Yeah, well, it'd be good. And you bring up the other thing about AI because it hallucinates. Sure. It's getting much better. When I first started in it, it hallucinated a lot. My best illustration is, you know, some attorneys would sit there and take a and let it right there and breathe for some minute. And yeah, it would cite a case that didn't exist. And my, my, my, yeah, my fiance's, she's a trial attorney and she was, would use it from time to time just to do research, say, hey, come up with some cases that fit this particular argument. And it would literally hallucinate cases that never happened. Yeah. Yeah. So one of the things that I find is if you put it into one place, as example, the chat or Claude and run it through there and take and flip it over in a complexity and have it double checks it. The thing I like about perplexity is it gives you the sources. And so right in the, it's answer you can click on the sources. And for example, I, I, I used to be a trial lawyer. But one of the things that I don't, I don't practice law anymore. But every now and then there's something that I have to look up. But one of the things that I'll do is look it up in general and then go into perplexity and then occasionally if there's something that just doesn't quite feel right, you click on the source, it'll give you the case. So then I read the entire case and then I know that what I've got is accurate information before I open my mouth. This, this is also your biggest thing about establishing a poor in credibility is you do something that's completely wrong. You just lost it. You know, trust, trust is hard to establish and it's real easy to lose. And so this is one of the things about a, as you've had a double check it before you, you know, if you're just taking copy it and paste it and spit it out, there's a decent chance that there's going to be something wrong. Now, that's not horrendous. Every one of us makes mistakes. I mean, you're never going to talk to somebody who is never going to make a mistake, who's never going to say something wrong. So, you know, that's normal. So it's not that we're lots of people who call this, this AI is this horrible tool because it makes mistakes. Yeah, don't we all? And so if you just adapt to that, to the fact that it's not perfect and double check before you spit it out, you're going to be fine. I couldn't agree with you more. And so one thing that I've done with AI, I assume you've probably done the same, is AI is very often, and maybe it's getting better, but it was very, I've noticed it would flatter me a lot, and it would tell me that all every idea I had was a brilliant idea. And when many of them weren't so brilliant, and it would tell me that any business sort of venture I was thinking about to going into was great. And I would go down these rabbit holes of like, wow, AI is on my side. It really thinks there's an opportunity here. And I have learned to, I have instructed it to not do that. And tell me what it's actual, you know, it's actual assessment of maybe an idea I have, or, you know, I'm working on a CRM right now that I'm kind of building from scratch. And I'm having it go through and say, let's go through the sales process. Is my sales process sound? Where do I have holes? Do not just tell me it's great. Look for holes, look for challenges. So I imagine you've probably instructed yours to do something similar. Yeah, actually that's something I need to do more. And frankly, I've learned something by being here, because I just sit there and try to ignore it. But instead, instead, if I just said, we don't need flattery, we need accurate, unbarnished facts. If it's something really stupid, put capital letters, S-T-U-P-I-D, you know, I want to know, as opposed to, oh, yes, I agree, I agree. No, no, no, it's like having a non-friend. You know, somebody who always agrees with you, somebody always who will, you know, no, you want to have something, because, you know, a real discourse and the difference of opinion and a different relationship that you can have. And, yeah, frankly, I haven't gone in and been instructed. I try to just myself overcome it and ignore it. I think you got a better idea. I know that just why it's different from just like, you know, you know, you have a name for your, for your, AI. And so I want to go in and give it more instruction saying, okay, one more thing you need to know about me, no flattery. You know, if, if I need to hear something unvarnished, you need to spit it out before I learn it the hard way. With, with chat, GPT, I have it, some, some engineer had written this long prompt to put into its permanent memory. Claude, I don't think works exactly the same way. I'd have to see if how to do this with Claude. But chat, GPT does have this and it's permanent memory for, you know, as a user, where you can, I have it now, give me a, an assessment at the end of the answer to say, how confident are, are they in this answer? And it is only able, you know, assuming it's following orders to tell me the truth and it will give me a flag, a, what they call a confidence flag. And it will say, hey, we think this is it, but don't take our word for it. Look, you know, and that really helps. And so I see some update to, to any of your AI books is a chapter on how to sort of tame AI and train it to, to be super honest and forthright and more objective versus subjective. So I see, I see that as a, a good thing is let's, let's prime, let's prime a not to just be our friend because it's really not our friend. It's just, it's a tool. It's a tool. Yeah. So and great, you know, thank goodness I haven't published a second book yet. I've got to go back to do a little rewrite on the chapter. So well, I love this and AI really does, you know, what is it done for your business as far as, you know, how much time has it saved you? How much more effective has it made you? It's dramatic. Now, you know, I've been in business a long time and I've gone sort of big career. I used to run a large team and I don't think. And so this is much more effective for me just to be able to do a whole lot of other things quickly and repetitive repetitive tasks. It's accepted. The way something where it's supposed to check this, that and the other and give you flags and alerts when you're not on schedule. That's one of the other things that you can use very effectively and negotiate or it was after you have put a deal together. It'll sit there and walk you through and keep you on track and make sure that you don't miss deadlines. Don't miss other things. And there's a lot of others off for that to do that. But it really has decreased the number of people I needed to have on my team. And the AI is not particularly expensive. The other people on my team, they cost a little bit now. And frankly, they made more mistakes than AI does. So this is greatly improved my ability to perform more effectively with the people that I like. Now, with negotiating with AI, my first thought was around what price should I offer. Are you relying on or are you using AI to help guide you in pricing strategy? Fandos, because what you can do is take an AI, cloud works better, Chatton will do this fairly well. But go in there and say, okay, this is their situation. Here's my situation. This is what I'm going to offer for the high probability of the outcome. What do you think their response is going to be? Because one of the things you're anchoring is a big effect in negotiating. If you have an initial point that you start lower, you're going to end up lower. For example, I'm trying to buy something. If I can get a persuasive number that people will give some respect to that is low, the studies show that we're going to end up at a lower price than so I'm going to do. But however, there's also a point where if you go way too low, it's insulting. And you're not going to end up better. They're going to make you apologize. And so instead of trying that out real life and running up the flag call and see what they do, go ahead and put it into AI. So take your offer and say, ask it for what's the most probable response. The other thing you can do is ask it for three different probable responses. So you can, as opposed to, you know, there's a whole lot of negotiations where at the very end, you look back and say, oh, God, I should have done this. Why didn't I think of that? Well, this way you can do it beforehand. It'll let you think of that before you have ruined the, you know, the relationship. And it'll give you some feedback in terms of should you do this or should you not do this. But yeah, it's really good on, just go ahead and roll play. And you practice it with them and it'll give you a response. It'll give you the probabilities of success or the probabilities of really making them mad. You know, you have given so many great reasons to why to use AI for negotiating. We talked about preparing for the negotiation, learning about the person on the other side, maybe learning about the deal, the property, the situation, building rapport, utilizing AI to get some commonality because we know like a tends to favor like and those negotiations tend to go more smoothly and possibly better for your side. And also winning from the start, you know, I know was also something is just, you know, crafting offers, knowing something about that personality type or the type of, you know, situation we're dealing with. Well, the thing we didn't talk about, which I know is in your book that I just want to spend a moment on because I think this is this is kind of blowing my mind, is real time coaching. So this idea that during the negotiation, you have this kind of real time coach to kind of guide you through, okay, now this is happening and do this. Can you speak just for a moment on that? Yeah, there's a number of AI apps that will sit there and analyze the interaction. For example, we'll read their emails and read their discussions and we'll flag certain things where it'll notice a change in the tone and make the change in the attitude and flag that these people are getting mad. Or, you know, so you're losing it and it'll give you a heads up. Autor, a lot of people use Autor just to record, you know, what's happening, you know, say you're on a meeting and you use Autor to do it. Well, one of the functions it has is it will give you a flag this saying, you're going off the rails here. That was something who's not going well. Now, I don't use it that much. One of the things I actually, you know, I like to point out things in my books that aren't something that I use, but it shouldn't be me who decides for the reader what it is that's best for them. You know, they need to know what's complete amount or what's available. I don't use those things that much because they distract me. I really like to focus on the people and really actively listen, you know, take a lot of effort on the listening, repeat that what they're saying, ask them again, you know, further depth of the question of why that's important with them and if we do that, what will that do for them, things of that nature. And so I've, on infill cases, I've tried it, but my own personal preference is to use my own judgment of, I hope that feedback is supposed to be AI's judgment. If people didn't get better, you know, and if you don't have the 45 year career with law and real estate that you have, you can, you can utilize AI to help give you some of that wisdom that it can find online. So yes, you have this amazing real life experience that you can draw from that you are very confident in. And for all of everyone else out there who's maybe new to the business, use AI for this sort of thing, especially, and I know this is also in your book, and this is, I think, incredibly valuable, which is handling conflict. How do you actually deal? Because conflict we know is part of every negotiation. It's built into the process and it is the most important part of relationships is handling, resolving conflict and AI can really help you. Can you speak for a moment on conflict? Yeah, frankly, one of my best tools on, one of my best tools on conflict is frankly getting old enough to where you're comfortable in your skin and you don't always have to be right. And one of the simplest ways to get the conflict to be over is everybody is sitting there. See, you don't want to let negotiating get into a situation. Well, I need to win this one. I got to win this one. I got to win this one. You've got this puzzle that you have to accomplish and you have to put all together. And so when you do find the conflict and when you can find something, you know, I've one of my best tools, frankly, is to apologize. And most people think that's nuts, you know, because you're showing weakness. No, you're not. You're showing strength. You're showing the ability to recognize that there is something you could have done better. So if you back off a little bit and you apologize and indicate that there was something that you are part of the problem that I created part of this issue. And maybe I could have done better ahead. We done this. If you change the whole attitude where you show some humanity and offer that humanity, you mentioned us across the earlier, but you're going to get some reciprocity back by just, you know, not having this pound, pound, pound, you know, attack attack attack attitude. If instead, it's we're working together here and collectively smarter than we are individually. So if you find something that you know, can justifyably, you know, apologize, maybe too strong the word, but if you can indicate that you recognize that you were part of the problem and that there's a better way that we could have done it. And I want to offer this as a better solution than what we've done before. That really helps. And the AI can point out a lot of the different possibilities and a lot of the different bits of information that you can use to reestablish that before. Now, as you should before, it will it will point out a lot of the things where things are going on, you know, the real time coaching. And then you have to be smart enough to figure out, okay, now that we've gotten into this mess, how do we get out of this mess? AI will give you a lot of data, but you've got to negotiate in some art. The event I have to art form under your belt and the ability to figure out, okay, this is where we are. This is not where we want to be. What are we trying to do? That's where the art of negotiate. Well, that's why I make a few dollars off of being the negotiating consultant. People will frequently get themselves in their own mess and I'll help them get out of it. But you know, same concept. When you get into conflict, you need to have the tools. And AI will give you some of the tools, but then you also have some of the training and some of that empathy and some of that gut feeling to be big enough to say, you know, I could have done better and if you start saying you could have done better and you want to offer some correction to what you've done, the other person will reciprocate you'll both get back on track. Yeah. And taking accountability is huge. And I found I couldn't believe as I got older into adulthood, how many adults found it seem seemingly challenging to say I'm sorry. A cell for the ones that do, oh boy, we love people that say they're sorry, don't we? Negotiationconsultant.com is the website. I want everybody I think Tim has made an incredible case to purchase this book. The AI negotiator dominate real estate deals with the power of artificial intelligence. I mean, just in this tax, the tips and tactics you've provided during this conversation, I have just been so impressed and Tim really knows his stuff and he has a lot of real world experience to as well to throw in to really help you navigate AI to make sure you're utilizing it correctly and not over relying upon it to make sure that you're holding it accountable for some clarity and some objective empirical information versus sometimes the hallucinations that we've experienced with it. But the AI negotiator will get you through negotiations so that it does truly become collaborative and resolves conflict and really just helps guide you from literally the beginning to the end. Not just price, not just on resolving the end part, but literally before starting, it actually gives you information that there's be very difficult for somebody to get ahead of time without artificial intelligence. So Tim, I love this idea. I think this is a brilliant idea and book and I really want our audience to pick it up. You can find it anywhere, you can find anywhere online, of course, but you can actually order it directly from Negotiatingconsultant.com. There's a link there. You can go to Amazon. It's there. It's got great reviews and I'm excited for version two that will come out later, but get this version now because very few agents are using it for negotiations. They're still just throwing it in for listing descriptions or getting information about a property. They're not really getting going as deep as Tim goes with you and this will give you a huge leg up. So Negotiating, Negotiatingconsultant.com is the website and AI negotiator is the book Find It on Amazon and on behalf of all of our audience, Tim, thank you for your time. Thank you for your 45 years of experience, bring that to our audience. We appreciate it. And if you're an agent that is not in the Raleigh area and you are interested and you have people that move to Raleigh, give Tim a call. He might be a good referral source for you and vice versa. If you have people that come from Raleigh, maybe they move down further south, although Raleigh is a pretty great place to stay all year round. But if they if you are one of those places where that's a feeder market, you know, reach out to Tim. He might be able to have some great referrals for you as well. Tim, thank you. Also, we're going to have a link to your email. We're going to send you can send out that super prompt as an as an example for everyone. We appreciate you. That was in the show notes. On behalf of everyone, thank you on behalf of Tim and myself. Thank you for sticking around to the end of the episode. Thank you for for being one of our lovely listeners and also please tell a friend. Think of one other agent that needs to hear this, which is every agent right now. So anyone in your office that does isn't currently a listener, please let them know about our show really helps us out. And we we appreciate you thanks to our sponsors. And we will see everybody on the next episode. Thanks, Tim. Thank you. Really enjoyed it.
