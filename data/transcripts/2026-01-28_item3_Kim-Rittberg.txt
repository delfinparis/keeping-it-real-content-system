[00:01:17] Today's episode is brought to you by corded.io.
[00:01:20] Are you looking for agents to join your brokerage or team?
[00:01:24] Now, as a real estate recruiter, I can tell you the answer is always yes.
[00:01:29] But most agents aren't looking to move right now.
[00:01:31] So how do you know who to contact?
[00:01:34] Well, what if I were to tell you there's a recruiting and retention tool powered by
[00:01:37] artificial intelligence that shows you exactly which agents in your local market
[00:01:42] are looking to leave their brokerage right now and which agents at your own firm are also
[00:01:48] looking to leave you?
[00:01:49] Now, I've been recruiting REALTORS for 15 years and I've hired over 2000 agents.
[00:01:54] I can tell you with no exaggeration, this is the tool I've been waiting for.
[00:01:58] Corded's AI looks for trends across dozens of variables for each agent in your market
[00:02:03] and shows you which agents they believe are likely to move.
[00:02:07] Not only does it do that, but corded's AI went and visited my recruiting website
[00:02:11] and read everything I offer.
[00:02:13] So now when I'm recruiting, corded's AI tells me exactly what to say based on that
[00:02:19] agent's needs and what my brokerage can offer.
[00:02:21] It even writes emails for me.
[00:02:23] I've never seen anything like it and I use it every single day.
[00:02:28] Now, if you are looking to grow your brokerage, corded.io is the best tool out there.
[00:02:33] Visit corded.io to schedule a demo again.
[00:02:36] That's corded.io.
[00:02:38] And now, onto the show.
[00:02:54] Hello, Keke Montgomery.
[00:02:55] My name is Kim Rick Berg.
[00:02:57] I am an award-winning video coach and I'm excited to talk to you today about first impressions
[00:03:02] on social media.
[00:03:03] And what I mean by that is I'm going to help take you through what the very front page of
[00:03:09] your social media handles should look like.
[00:03:11] My I'm so passionate about this is because I see so many agents coming to me and they're
[00:03:16] really knowledgeable, hard working, smart.
[00:03:19] But when you go to their page, it just doesn't show it.
[00:03:22] So I'm going to go through what your page should look like and some small tweaks that
[00:03:25] you should make.
[00:03:26] And by the way, if you are looking to do video in 2026, I have a free webinar coming up.
[00:03:31] Make sure to message me.
[00:03:32] I'm at Kim Rick Berg, K-I-M-R-I-T-T-B-E-R-G.
[00:03:37] On Instagram, LinkedIn, Facebook, YouTube.
[00:03:40] So you can find me there.
[00:03:41] Just drop me a note.
[00:03:42] You can go to KimRickberg.com slash webinar to sign up.
[00:03:45] And so about the front page.
[00:03:48] So this is something that's really, really important to me.
[00:03:50] And my background is in TV.
[00:03:52] I worked at Inside Edition, Netflix.
[00:03:54] It was a journalist for many years.
[00:03:55] And now I coach agents around the country.
[00:03:58] I do a lot of keynote speaking.
[00:03:59] And I meet a lot of agents when I go to their page.
[00:04:02] That page does not show them as the expert they are.
[00:04:05] And I want to help you with that.
[00:04:06] So first things first, when you think about what to write in your bio, that's something
[00:04:11] you should actually sit down and put a lot of time and thought into.
[00:04:15] Bios are searchable for the most part on social media platform.
[00:04:19] Meaning Google is going to search it.
[00:04:21] So you really want to make sure that what you're writing is exactly right for people searching for it.
[00:04:27] For example, I live in New York.
[00:04:29] So actually I work with a lot of agents in New York.
[00:04:32] If I'm a New York agent and I focus specifically on Brooklyn, not all of New York City,
[00:04:37] maybe Brooklyn, I would want to have that in there.
[00:04:40] Really R.E. Agent, Real Estate Agent, Brooklyn, New York.
[00:04:44] You want to make sure you have your area.
[00:04:46] For some people, it's a section.
[00:04:48] For some people, it's three neighborhoods.
[00:04:50] Right, I have one of my clients in Minnesota.
[00:04:51] He's focusing on three neighborhoods.
[00:04:53] Have that be searchable.
[00:04:54] You want people who are looking for an agent in your area to land on your page.
[00:04:59] It might now seem like is that really going to happen?
[00:05:02] It does happen when you do the right steps.
[00:05:04] So that front page should have searchable name.
[00:05:08] A searchable title, your name, your actual full name.
[00:05:12] And then any accolades awards that you've won, meaning like top five in your area,
[00:05:18] you could put your total amount, right?
[00:05:19] It can be X million sold.
[00:05:22] How many years you've been in business, anything that really makes somebody think you're not the new kid on the block.
[00:05:26] And if you are the new kid on the block,
[00:05:28] come up with some other way to do that, right?
[00:05:30] We, and message me we can brainstorm on other ways to do that.
[00:05:33] You can talk about other like things that you can showcase that you have been able to do.
[00:05:39] Client wins, things like that.
[00:05:41] So everybody has things they can brag about.
[00:05:44] All right, now we're talking about content.
[00:05:47] What content to do me making.
[00:05:49] And again, if you really want to learn how to make content,
[00:05:52] then definitely join me on that free live workshop.
[00:05:55] It's going to be interactive.
[00:05:56] We're going to learn so much.
[00:05:58] When people are coming to your page,
[00:06:00] maybe they searched for you, maybe they met you,
[00:06:03] and they're looking online to confirm that you are legit, right?
[00:06:07] Those are kind of the ways you're thinking about people landing.
[00:06:10] It's like your storefront.
[00:06:11] So when they're on your page, and they're looking at your website,
[00:06:14] and they're looking at your social,
[00:06:16] I want to see you posting content like this.
[00:06:21] One is about me, who you are, what you're about,
[00:06:24] and how you can help people.
[00:06:26] Yes, people want to know who you are and what you're about.
[00:06:28] However, they really want to know how you can help them.
[00:06:32] So make sure that is in there.
[00:06:35] Who do you sell to?
[00:06:36] Who do you focus on?
[00:06:37] Do you focus on buyers?
[00:06:38] Do you focus on sellers?
[00:06:39] Do you focus on a certain cohort?
[00:06:42] Do you have?
[00:06:43] Have you been in business for two, 20 years?
[00:06:46] Have you landed as number five in your area?
[00:06:48] Anything like that can really separate you,
[00:06:51] but also show somebody.
[00:06:52] You really love this.
[00:06:53] You love doing this.
[00:06:53] You're super successful.
[00:06:55] So in that video.
[00:06:57] And again, that can be simple.
[00:06:59] Eventually, you'll want to have one that's a little more built out.
[00:07:02] But we can talk about that message me if you have any questions.
[00:07:04] We can talk it through.
[00:07:06] So really you want to introduce yourself to people.
[00:07:10] What you want to do this?
[00:07:11] When someone is considering working with you,
[00:07:13] they want to learn more about you.
[00:07:14] And you want to have more information on your page.
[00:07:17] So when they hop on the phone, they're like,
[00:07:19] I know who you are.
[00:07:20] I know your energy.
[00:07:21] I trust you.
[00:07:22] I like you.
[00:07:22] Let's work together.
[00:07:23] So your social media can do more of that warmly in building.
[00:07:30] We got that about me video.
[00:07:32] Now what else?
[00:07:33] On your page, I want to see the next video.
[00:07:36] Show casing that you are an expert.
[00:07:41] So when I work with people,
[00:07:42] I have this amazing program called Video Bootcamp.
[00:07:44] Before we hit record, we always narrow down who you are and what you focus on.
[00:07:50] So I want you to have very much a lot of clarity about exactly who you're working with.
[00:07:57] And we're going to use that information to build you an expert video.
[00:08:01] Something that showcases your knowledge.
[00:08:03] So you're going to be answering,
[00:08:04] answering a question,
[00:08:05] sharing advice to your clients,
[00:08:08] your ideal clients in that video.
[00:08:10] So someone can go to that, right?
[00:08:12] So for example,
[00:08:13] I'm in New York,
[00:08:14] maybe my, you know, in my area.
[00:08:16] I've been in New York City.
[00:08:18] It's a lot of apartments, right?
[00:08:19] We have co-ops who condos.
[00:08:21] Sometimes I was a lot of apartment buildings.
[00:08:24] So, you know, a good,
[00:08:25] a good video would be focusing on co-ops or condos or one neighborhood versus another neighborhood.
[00:08:30] If you're in that neighborhood, right?
[00:08:32] So I might say Brooklyn Heights versus Cobble Hill.
[00:08:35] Right. Those are just two areas in Brooklyn.
[00:08:36] So again, you're getting really specific about your expertise.
[00:08:41] It could be financial advice.
[00:08:43] It could be selling advice, right?
[00:08:47] And so, I'll just get really,
[00:08:48] really, really specific about who your clients are.
[00:08:51] Everyone has Google.
[00:08:52] Everyone has to add to you.
[00:08:54] Don't just take the phone to the internet and say it.
[00:08:57] Really think about what is your opinion,
[00:08:58] what is your take?
[00:08:59] How are you going to guide your client?
[00:09:01] That is the sort of expertise someone's looking for to trust you with an investment,
[00:09:05] like a home.
[00:09:07] So video on,
[00:09:08] we have the about me.
[00:09:09] Video to we have the expert.
[00:09:10] Video three can be a variety of things.
[00:09:12] I don't like to be too stringent.
[00:09:14] If you're focusing on becoming kind of the local expert,
[00:09:18] trying to be the mayor of your area,
[00:09:19] I'd love to see a video that shows you out and about
[00:09:22] in your neighborhood and talking about it.
[00:09:24] It really shows people that you're the expert in the neighborhood
[00:09:27] when you're sharing your advice,
[00:09:29] you're taking people around,
[00:09:31] you're letting them know you understand the nuances
[00:09:34] of this corner versus that corner.
[00:09:35] This micro neighborhood versus that neighborhood.
[00:09:39] That is a way to build that credibility
[00:09:42] and that trust so that they want to work with you.
[00:09:45] So now when we're talking about that storefront,
[00:09:48] people are going to go there and they're going to say,
[00:09:50] oh, I get who you are, I get what you're about.
[00:09:54] And for some people, honestly,
[00:09:56] you're starting from scratch.
[00:09:57] For other people, it's kind of like a facelift.
[00:09:59] Maybe you have some of it,
[00:10:01] maybe you have all of it, but it doesn't look good.
[00:10:02] It doesn't, it's not searchable.
[00:10:04] And maybe you're somewhere in the middle
[00:10:05] where you need a couple of things added,
[00:10:08] tweaking a little bit.
[00:10:09] It's okay, no matter where you are,
[00:10:11] you really want to think about leveling up
[00:10:12] that front page is treated as your storefront.
[00:10:16] All right, I'm going to keep this one short.
[00:10:17] I feel like I gave you a lot of information
[00:10:19] for this short amount of time,
[00:10:20] but if you really want to learn more about video,
[00:10:22] getting confident on camera,
[00:10:23] what to make to actually get leads and clients
[00:10:25] if you're one of those agents who's like,
[00:10:27] oh, I'm making all this content,
[00:10:29] but like nothing's happening or I say I'm getting a camera,
[00:10:31] I'm really not getting on camera.
[00:10:33] Come to this workshop, it's going to be fun.
[00:10:35] It's a free live workshop message me,
[00:10:37] Kim Rittberg, R-I-T-T-E-E-R-G,
