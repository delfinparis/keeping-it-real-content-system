[00:02:45] My conversation with top producer Sarah Stone.
[00:02:57] OK, tonight, my guest is Sarah Stone from Douglas element.
[00:03:04] She's in Fairfield.
[00:03:05] County, Connecticut, Greenwich, Westport,
[00:03:08] and also in New York and Westchester as well.
[00:03:11] Let me tell you more about Sarah.
[00:03:12] Sarah, this is really an impressive biography.
[00:03:16] So I really want you guys to clue in on this
[00:03:17] because we're gonna touch about a lot of what
[00:03:19] I'm about to mention here.
[00:03:21] So Sarah was a top producing broker at Douglas
[00:03:23] Elements Manhattan office at 575 Madison Avenue
[00:03:26] for a decade.
[00:03:27] She was rookie of the year during her tenure there
[00:03:29] in Manhattan.
[00:03:31] She sold many, many high profile properties,
[00:03:33] including 65th East 76th, 800 Park Avenue,
[00:03:37] and the world famous Dakota building,
[00:03:39] which is at one west 72nd.
[00:03:41] She has now taken her experience, knowledge,
[00:03:43] and famed sales experience and expanded it
[00:03:46] from New York into the Connecticut suburbs,
[00:03:49] specializing in the purchase and sale of fine homes
[00:03:52] in both Fairfield and Westchester counties.
[00:03:55] Sarah also has a fine eye for exterior interior design.
[00:03:58] She's an expert in staging and decorating a home.
[00:04:02] She's resided and raised children in both Bedford, New York
[00:04:04] and Greenwich, Connecticut.
[00:04:06] She is the perfect guide to find
[00:04:08] or sell your own suburban splendor.
[00:04:10] A former nationally ranked tennis player,
[00:04:13] which I would love to ask a few questions
[00:04:14] to improve my own game.
[00:04:16] Sarah spends her free time playing tennis and also pickable.
[00:04:19] And I do wanna talk about pickable
[00:04:20] because I am, the noise of it is my only issue
[00:04:24] with pickable is noise, but it is a fun game.
[00:04:27] In one of Greenwich's most beautiful town parks
[00:04:30] or clubs, Sarah can also be spotted driving around
[00:04:32] in her vintage Mercedes convertible.
[00:04:35] I want everybody to follow Sarah on her Instagram.
[00:04:38] She has an amazing Instagram following Sarah Stone style.
[00:04:42] So S, S, S Sarah with an H stone style.
[00:04:46] We will, so at Sarah Stone style,
[00:04:47] we'll have a link to that in the show notes
[00:04:49] and also a link to her Douglas Elliman website.
[00:04:53] Definitely check her out on social.
[00:04:54] She does some really super cool things.
[00:04:56] Sarah, welcome to the show.
[00:04:57] Well, thank you.
[00:04:58] That was an extraordinary intro.
[00:05:00] I really appreciate that.
[00:05:02] Thank you very much.
[00:05:04] We really appreciate you coming on.
[00:05:06] Thank you.
[00:05:07] We appreciate you and coming on our show
[00:05:09] is a big deal for us.
[00:05:10] We know just how busy top producers like you are
[00:05:14] and it's been the biggest and loveliest surprise for me
[00:05:17] as starting the show like five or six years ago
[00:05:20] in thinking, oh, none of these top producers
[00:05:22] are ever going to have time for this.
[00:05:24] And yet here we are like 500 episodes later
[00:05:26] and still being able to get top producers like you
[00:05:30] to give us some time that I know is in short supply for you.
[00:05:34] So thank you, thank you.
[00:05:36] Absolutely, my pleasure.
[00:05:38] Let's start at the beginning.
[00:05:41] So how did you get into real estate and why?
[00:05:44] So my journey to real estate actually started,
[00:05:50] I'd say fairly early on relatively speaking,
[00:05:54] I graduated with a degree in economics
[00:05:58] from Tulane University down south.
[00:06:02] And I, at that time, my goal was let's,
[00:06:09] let me get a job that will make me the most amount of money
[00:06:14] the quickest.
[00:06:16] I wasn't like, what's my passion?
[00:06:18] I'm one of my good at it.
[00:06:20] I was like, let me get into Wall Street
[00:06:23] and let's get cracking.
[00:06:26] Sure.
[00:06:26] And that's what I did.
[00:06:27] I worked for a mutual fund called Lord Abbott.
[00:06:33] That was my first.
[00:06:33] Sure.
[00:06:34] Sure.
[00:06:35] That I was in the GM building on 58th Street
[00:06:41] right across from the Plaza Hotel.
[00:06:43] And I got my Series 7, my Series 7 and 63.
[00:06:51] I had those both as well.
[00:06:53] My first job as a financial advisor.
[00:06:54] So I know that world.
[00:06:55] Yeah.
[00:06:57] So I was working as, I was selling,
[00:07:04] working with regional managers to sell our various funds.
[00:07:09] And I did that for a little bit there.
[00:07:11] And then I moved on to another bank, DLJ,
[00:07:15] which is back from that sort of a 90s,
[00:07:19] was a boutique kind of bank back then
[00:07:23] that was bought by Credit Suisse First Boston while I was there.
[00:07:27] When, as I was working at DLJ,
[00:07:33] I worked at the registered sales assistant
[00:07:35] for the bigger brokers, retail brokers there.
[00:07:40] And it's a very fast, hasty pressure,
[00:07:45] male dominated, especially that.
[00:07:48] Sell, sell, sell, business.
[00:07:52] And it's frantically paced, although not to say that this business isn't.
[00:07:59] But it was just, it was something like,
[00:08:02] oh, did I kick the right thing for me?
[00:08:08] And this is when my introspective examination
[00:08:12] of my thoughts and goals really untrurally were.
[00:08:19] And this is another bit of diversion.
[00:08:23] But I was always into, I wanted to be into acting,
[00:08:29] theater, modeling, and that kind of thing.
[00:08:32] So I said, okay, I'm going to try,
[00:08:36] I'm going to go for all that stuff.
[00:08:38] I'm going to go for my dreams, but the pay isn't so great
[00:08:41] when you're starting out.
[00:08:43] So I said, I'm going to subsidize that with,
[00:08:46] I'll be also some real estate on the side.
[00:08:48] I had gone through the process of renting an apartment in Manhattan.
[00:08:53] And I saw, I got a little bit of a window
[00:08:58] into how all that worked.
[00:09:00] And I asked my broker a lot of questions.
[00:09:05] And in Manhattan, especially, I mean,
[00:09:08] you're paying back then, you're paying a 15% commission
[00:09:13] to the two-year broker at the end.
[00:09:15] Yeah, let's talk about this.
[00:09:17] Let's pause for a second because this is a very important distinction.
[00:09:21] What Sarah's like, oh, okay, I really am acting, modeling.
[00:09:25] I want to pursue that.
[00:09:26] And I'll do some real estate on the side.
[00:09:28] What she, what if you don't know rentals in New York City,
[00:09:33] one of the things that she's explaining right now,
[00:09:35] and I apologize for being rude and interrupting,
[00:09:36] but I want to make sure everyone understands this.
[00:09:38] It's very different from pretty much every major market.
[00:09:41] Maybe Boston's a little bit this way too.
[00:09:43] But Boston in New York, I think,
[00:09:45] are the only two markets that do this,
[00:09:46] where oftentimes the renter pays the commission,
[00:09:50] which is a tough sell, right?
[00:09:53] That is hard.
[00:09:55] Oh, by the way, I need an extra $5,000.
[00:09:57] It is.
[00:09:58] Yeah, on top of, I mean,
[00:10:00] you know, on top of first month, last month.
[00:10:03] First month, last month, and your security deposit.
[00:10:06] And here's another 15% of the year's rent.
[00:10:12] So yeah, definitely it was something that I made note of
[00:10:17] when I was going through the process, like,
[00:10:19] oh, doing the math, you know, let's see.
[00:10:23] And this is just rentals, you know,
[00:10:25] I wasn't even thinking about the sales game then.
[00:10:28] So I had sort of a connection at Douglas Salomon.
[00:10:35] And they, well, you know, they said,
[00:10:38] let's give a shot, do your thing.
[00:10:41] And that first year, I made 10 times
[00:10:46] what I made doing the acting modeling gig in real estate.
[00:10:51] So amazing.
[00:10:52] I found that I really had a knack for it.
[00:10:55] And not only that, I really enjoyed,
[00:10:59] I enjoyed getting, because I just love New York City so much.
[00:11:04] And I found that I really had so much passion
[00:11:08] for just checking it all out and getting to know
[00:11:11] all the different neighborhoods.
[00:11:14] And, you know, and like, how great is that?
[00:11:16] Like, my job is just kind of cruising around the city
[00:11:19] and checking out all kind, I mean, especially in those early days,
[00:11:24] you wouldn't believe like what I was,
[00:11:27] wasn't all glamour, trust me.
[00:11:30] I was, you know, I was trying like to sell this studio
[00:11:35] that was above subway, sandwich shop that smelled like bread all the time.
[00:11:42] That's subway bread.
[00:11:43] I still to this day.
[00:11:44] I can't.
[00:11:45] It's burned into my sense memory.
[00:11:47] I get locked into a subway.
[00:11:48] I can't, it just takes me back to like, you know,
[00:11:51] I was probably, I must have shown that thing over 50 times.
[00:11:54] So I spend a lot of time in that apartment.
[00:11:58] But that's sort of like how it was,
[00:12:02] it was definitely the money was great at that time.
[00:12:06] And it was, I found that I really enjoyed it
[00:12:11] and it was something that I was really good at.
[00:12:13] So I just sort of morphed more and more
[00:12:17] making that into my full-time occupation.
[00:12:21] And so you really built your career in the city
[00:12:25] and then you've then made, eventually made a move.
[00:12:28] And so essentially, I mean, it wasn't like you moved across the country
[00:12:32] so it was neighboring, but still far enough
[00:12:34] away where it's a different world,
[00:12:35] at least a bit of a different world.
[00:12:37] And having to sort of start over essentially is in incredible.
[00:12:43] It's almost like, it's almost like an attorney
[00:12:45] who passes the bar in New York.
[00:12:48] And then all of a sudden it's like, you know,
[00:12:49] I think I really want to live in Arizona.
[00:12:51] It's like, well, they don't have to,
[00:12:52] they no have to go do it all over again in Arizona.
[00:12:54] Right, right, right.
[00:12:56] You know, and so you essentially had a similar kind of experience
[00:12:59] where you were moving from Manhattan,
[00:13:01] which is insanely a challenging market to be a REALTOR
[00:13:04] and whether you're doing rentals, sales.
[00:13:07] I've interviewed tons of people, even from your firm,
[00:13:09] who work in New York, how challenging,
[00:13:12] of course we all know how challenging it is.
[00:13:14] And then to then go somewhere else and say,
[00:13:17] I'm just like to start all over essentially.
[00:13:18] And again, I understand it's not completely starting over,
[00:13:20] but essentially it is.
[00:13:21] So that is even more amazing is that you've sort of,
[00:13:25] you were rookie of the year in New York
[00:13:27] and then back into the suburbs as your life changed.
[00:13:32] And so what was that transition like,
[00:13:34] like going to a new market, a new area
[00:13:36] and trying to build your business again?
[00:13:38] Well, it was, I was, I'm very grateful for my firm,
[00:13:45] Douglas Aliment, because that,
[00:13:48] the fact that they are the biggest mover of real estate
[00:13:51] in Manhattan and they had opened up an element office
[00:13:58] in Greenwich about five years prior to my joining.
[00:14:02] So they had nice established referral thing going on
[00:14:08] on their own.
[00:14:09] I stepped in with some,
[00:14:12] a lot of pre-existing relationships with brokers
[00:14:14] that I had worked with in Manhattan while I was there.
[00:14:18] And while I was in the city, I should mention,
[00:14:22] I worked in three different offices while I was there.
[00:14:26] I was at 575, but I was also on the upper west side
[00:14:29] for a little bit.
[00:14:31] I worked at 980 Madison for a little while.
[00:14:34] So I really got to know a lot of brokers
[00:14:38] and in this business you'll find,
[00:14:41] I mean, people go 20 years in this business easy.
[00:14:46] So there's a lot, there was a lot of people
[00:14:47] that are still very much active in their careers
[00:14:51] that I have worked with back then.
[00:14:53] So it was a very, I was very lucky to be able to light up
[00:14:57] those relationships and knock on,
[00:15:00] knock and call people up and say,
[00:15:04] hey, I'm back in the game, what have you got?
[00:15:06] Let's go.
[00:15:07] And it was the timing,
[00:15:09] couldn't have been better, obviously,
[00:15:11] with that the start of the pandemic
[00:15:14] and the major shift,
[00:15:16] the demographic shift that we all saw
[00:15:18] from the city to the suburbs.
[00:15:21] Yeah, that really was good timing.
[00:15:24] I'm sure it wasn't, it was accidentally good for you.
[00:15:26] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:15:27] What a fortunate thing.
[00:15:30] And yet still, there's still a lot of competition,
[00:15:33] of course, where you are.
[00:15:34] And there's a lot of great REALTORS.
[00:15:37] And so, you know, you,
[00:15:39] I'm assuming you were able to take a lot of the
[00:15:42] sort of habits and disciplines
[00:15:44] and that you learned, you know,
[00:15:46] work and see.
[00:15:47] Oh, yeah.
[00:15:47] I mean, I think, you know, being a good salesperson
[00:15:50] is being a good salesperson.
[00:15:52] You know, like, you remember the,
[00:15:54] the wolf of Wall Street.
[00:15:56] Sure.
[00:15:57] And that last thing, you know,
[00:15:59] he had gone to the federal prison for,
[00:16:03] for, you know, his, his tax evasion and fraud,
[00:16:07] wire, fraud and all the stuff that he had done.
[00:16:11] And he got out and then he was giving seminars
[00:16:15] across the country and holding, he said,
[00:16:19] sell me the pen.
[00:16:20] 
[00:16:21] Yeah.
[00:16:22] Right.
[00:16:22] And, and that's sort of the,
[00:16:25] that's the spirit.
[00:16:26] You know, like when, if you have this skill,
[00:16:29] it can, it can really work across a lot of different platforms.
[00:16:35] So, well, I was good at doing it at,
[00:16:37] and I was, you know, a REALTOR in Manhattan
[00:16:40] selling co-ops and condos.
[00:16:42] It, my skills that was very applicable as far as,
[00:16:46] as selling homes here, here up in the suburbs.
[00:16:51] It's just, you know, we didn't have,
[00:16:52] have septic tanks and we didn't worry about that,
[00:16:56] like, sewage and all that stuff.
[00:17:01] Roots, there's a whole other aspects of real estate
[00:17:06] that goes on here that isn't necessarily,
[00:17:08] I mean, back in the city,
[00:17:09] you have to worry about co-op or packages,
[00:17:11] which forget about it.
[00:17:13] I don't miss those whatsoever.
[00:17:15] I always loved when my sister bought a condo,
[00:17:19] or sorry, co-op in the West Village many, many years ago.
[00:17:23] And my sister's kind of a little superstar
[00:17:25] in her own, in the industry she's in.
[00:17:28] And she was certainly more than qualified to buy this co-op.
[00:17:32] And she, you know, they got the offer accepted.
[00:17:35] And this is like a million years ago
[00:17:37] and I didn't know anything about real estate.
[00:17:38] She's like, oh, and now I have to go for my interview
[00:17:40] and I was like, your interview.
[00:17:41] You're my, I was like, what is that?
[00:17:43] And so if no one's ever dealt with co-ops
[00:17:45] before you can obviously look this up,
[00:17:47] but there's typically an interview process
[00:17:48] to make sure that the, because co-ops are slightly different,
[00:17:51] it's ownership share.
[00:17:52] So everyone's kind of owning everything to a degree.
[00:17:56] So they want to make sure that you're not some total bozo
[00:17:58] who's going to screw everything up for everyone.
[00:17:59] And so oftentimes you do have to go in front
[00:18:02] of the board and forget about, forget about that
[00:18:04] you put 100% down or whatever.
[00:18:07] They're not evaluating that.
[00:18:09] They want to make sure personality wise
[00:18:11] that you're not a total joke.
[00:18:12] They want to know who your best friend was in second grade.
[00:18:16] They want to know your blood type.
[00:18:17] They want to feel your bank accounts.
[00:18:19] I mean, they, they want to know every little detail about you.
[00:18:24] And you, they have a package about that thick in front of you.
[00:18:27] 
[00:18:27] Did you ever see it?
[00:18:28] Did you ever have a deal go south
[00:18:30] because the personalities didn't line up?
[00:18:32] Did that, oh, yeah.
[00:18:34] Oh, yeah.
[00:18:35] Oh, it was, I learned that game very quickly.
[00:18:41] It was my very first, one of my first co-op deals
[00:18:47] I remember I was dealing with a, the building on the upper east side
[00:18:51] that was a very snooty, you know,
[00:18:55] considered themselves quite a and established
[00:18:58] and, you know, prestigious building.
[00:19:02] It was a 50% down requirement.
[00:19:04] You had to put down at least half.
[00:19:06] And then you had to have at least three times the amount
[00:19:09] of the apartment in liquid assets.
[00:19:12] In liquid assets, oh nice.
[00:19:14] In liquid up, yep, on hand.
[00:19:16] So I mean, I have like $4 million sitting in cash.
[00:19:20] Yeah.
[00:19:21] Yeah.
[00:19:22] And, and my, I had a client who was like,
[00:19:25] I'm paying all cash and PSI have $50 million in the bank account.
[00:19:31] Let's, let's rock and roll.
[00:19:33] The board came back and said, okay,
[00:19:36] we'd like to do the interview in July 15th.
[00:19:42] They, my client said, no, July's no good.
[00:19:45] What do you have in August?
[00:19:48] So that was all they needed.
[00:19:51] That was it.
[00:19:51] That was the end.
[00:19:52] Sorry, you're not a fit.
[00:19:53] We need you to come in July.
[00:19:55] I just said, yeah, amazing.
[00:19:57] That was it.
[00:19:58] They said, if this guy's,
[00:20:00] if that's how he's going to play it, forget.
[00:20:01] I mean, you have to, as though you're approaching,
[00:20:05] you're getting an introduction with the queen.
[00:20:07] I mean, that's how you have to think of it.
[00:20:09] Like you have to be so honored.
[00:20:11] You have to, like if you've got plans and stuff.
[00:20:13] Kisht the ring.
[00:20:14] Forget it.
[00:20:15] We don't care.
[00:20:16] Let's go.
[00:20:17] Like, isn't that amazing?
[00:20:18] Oh, yeah.
[00:20:19] When they call you, calm.
[00:20:21] And I learned that very quickly.
[00:20:23] 
[00:20:24] And you probably have to then prepare your clients
[00:20:27] for those interviews and say, like, okay, here's,
[00:20:29] here's some suggestions about like, don't speak in the spoke.
[00:20:32] You know, whatever, you know, only give the right answer.
[00:20:34] Don't, you know, whatever, whatever the, you know,
[00:20:37] the same sort of thing if you're going in for like being
[00:20:38] deposed by the attorneys, don't say anything that you don't.
[00:20:43] 
[00:20:43] But it's like happy and ethical and, you know,
[00:20:48] talk about your golf handicap.
[00:20:49] And kind of smash earlier that day.
[00:20:52] And that's about it.
[00:20:54] So, so moving out to the suburbs, moving away from the co-ops,
[00:20:58] the condos, more single family homes,
[00:21:01] and really kind of learning a new inventory, I'm guessing,
[00:21:05] you know, is going out there and really trying to learn that.
[00:21:09] Real quickly, though, just curious.
[00:21:11] I want to go just briefly back to your very first year doing,
[00:21:15] you know, rentals and maybe some sales in the city.
[00:21:18] In New York, how do you think or why do you think
[00:21:22] you did so much better than so many other rookies that year?
[00:21:26] Was there anything that you can say, you know,
[00:21:28] I was really good at X, Y, or Z,
[00:21:31] or I just did things that other people wouldn't do?
[00:21:33] Just curious on what you thought made the difference for you.
[00:21:36] Well, for me, it was, I worked as an assistant
[00:21:40] to one of the top producers in a legend.
[00:21:45] And I was very lucky to work for this man.
[00:21:48] His name's Robbie Brown.
[00:21:50] He is no longer with us.
[00:21:52] He passed away a couple of years ago,
[00:21:54] but he is a legend in the industry and an incredible guy.
[00:22:02] And not at all like a typical broker.
[00:22:07] Like he was laid back, he rode a bike around the city,
[00:22:11] he would ride a bike to, you know,
[00:22:14] to your listing appointments.
[00:22:16] He was so cool and casual about it.
[00:22:21] But that was on the exterior.
[00:22:25] Meantime, he was hustling like nobody's business.
[00:22:29] You know, he was a great networker.
[00:22:34] He went to every party.
[00:22:36] He went to the opening of an envelope, you know, he was there.
[00:22:39] He mailed the world, you know,
[00:22:43] he had people working for him that he just grinded.
[00:22:46] It just sent, you know, postcards out, blanketing the city
[00:22:50] with mailings, you know, like that old age old adage
[00:22:56] that we love so much if you throw enough shit on the wall.
[00:22:58] Some of it's going to stick type thing.
[00:23:00] I bet this really applies when it comes to this.
[00:23:04] And the other thing that I learned from him
[00:23:07] is the value of relationships.
[00:23:10] He had certain clients that he worked with,
[00:23:15] that it always goes back to the, you know,
[00:23:20] it being a referral business, right?
[00:23:22] So like he had certain people that he worked with,
[00:23:29] that provided a pretty steady flow of listings.
[00:23:34] And one of those sources was from estate attorneys.
[00:23:39] Huge, huge, brilliant.
[00:23:42] And I thought, you know, when I,
[00:23:47] so when I went out on my own, I emulated him to the tee.
[00:23:51] And I, first thing I did was I targeted attorneys.
[00:23:55] So smart.
[00:23:56] And I, and it didn't take that, it didn't take too many.
[00:24:01] You know, I had probably two or three estate attorneys
[00:24:05] and I have one divorce attorney.
[00:24:07] Kind of that I really worked on developing
[00:24:10] those relationships with.
[00:24:11] I would show up in the office with lunch.
[00:24:15] I would send, you know, bring donuts in the morning.
[00:24:18] I went around and drew to myself dropping business cards.
[00:24:22] Thank hello to everybody in the office.
[00:24:25] You know, to the point where they started
[00:24:29] throwing me some listings, you know, smaller ones at first.
[00:24:33] And then when those would go well,
[00:24:35] they give me the bigger ones.
[00:24:36] And that's how I ended up getting that decodal listing
[00:24:39] was through this estate attorney.
[00:24:42] Yes.
[00:24:43] Yeah. So it really is it, you know,
[00:24:45] if you have, if you think about it,
[00:24:47] it makes all the sense in the world.
[00:24:49] If you have a loved one that that died
[00:24:51] and owns a Manhattan apartment,
[00:24:56] of course, you're going to go with who your attorney
[00:24:59] recommends you use.
[00:25:02] Especially if you're not, if you, you know,
[00:25:04] if you're the benefactor of the estate,
[00:25:08] you don't live locally or you just hand it right over.
[00:25:14] And so I would have to say that that was really the most,
[00:25:19] that was a critical move that I made
[00:25:23] that differentiated me from the rest of my pack.
[00:25:28] Let's call it my incoming class.
[00:25:31] And it's funny because I've certainly heard of attorneys
[00:25:35] calling divorce attorneys and of course,
[00:25:37] estate planning attorneys make all the sense in the world.
[00:25:39] I don't know why that wouldn't have occurred to me.
[00:25:41] But I think you might be the first person in all the hundreds of episodes
[00:25:44] we've done that have mentioned a state planning attorney.
[00:25:46] So I'm, I'm almost thinking they may be a bigger opportunity
[00:25:50] in certain ways because a lot of agents maybe do think
[00:25:55] I should call a divorce attorney and get,
[00:25:56] and you should do that, of course,
[00:25:58] should build those relationships.
[00:25:59] But a state planning attorneys maybe go a little bit,
[00:26:01] a little bit forgotten.
[00:26:03] Yeah.
[00:26:03] Call it over to the radar.
[00:26:05] But yeah,
[00:26:05] completely that brilliant.
[00:26:07] Yeah, that's a thousand percent.
[00:26:10] That even more seven divorce attorneys,
[00:26:12] I'd say because you know, divorce is complicated.
[00:26:15] And typically, especially if there are two people
[00:26:21] that are two parties that are, have vested interest in that apartment.
[00:26:26] Usually, you know, somebody knows somebody,
[00:26:29] they've lived in the town.
[00:26:30] They've got somebody they want to use.
[00:26:32] You know, they're less likely to need the referral than an estate attorney.
[00:26:37] Great point.
[00:26:38] Because a lot of times when mom and dad pass
[00:26:41] and the kids now are to deal with all the estate stuff
[00:26:44] or one of them, it's people are either moving
[00:26:47] or they're living in different places.
[00:26:49] Kids live in this Wisconsin.
[00:26:51] I love that.
[00:26:53] Yeah, they don't want to know from that.
[00:26:55] They just, you know, they go to the probate court
[00:26:58] and go through probate, I should say.
[00:27:02] And they'll trust their attorneys to handle it for them.
[00:27:07] And that's a really good spot.
[00:27:10] If you have a few relationships with some very,
[00:27:15] you know, some successful attorneys that have quite a few clients
[00:27:20] or states that they handle it,
[00:27:22] definitely, that is a huge place for inventory.
[00:27:28] I could see two people of REALTORS doing webinars
[00:27:32] or in-person events where it's like,
[00:27:36] hey, if you haven't done your estate plan,
[00:27:38] I'm going to bring my estate planning attorney
[00:27:40] and we'll do a little combo of like, you know,
[00:27:43] a little presentation.
[00:27:43] Right, right.
[00:27:44] I could see that being.
[00:27:46] Yeah, absolutely.
[00:27:47] Oh, totally, definitely.
[00:27:49] That's very much the case.
[00:27:50] Again, with attorneys, you know,
[00:27:54] it's, you're not supposed to, you can't technically,
[00:27:57] you cannot get, they're not entitled to a commission on that.
[00:28:02] Like you can't say, oh, I'll kick it back to you, you know,
[00:28:05] but you can, in other ways, you know,
[00:28:10] try to have them benefit from your business
[00:28:14] as you are from theirs.
[00:28:16] And that is one way is bringing them in
[00:28:19] for something like what you're saying,
[00:28:22] like a seminar or recommending them to,
[00:28:25] Sure.
[00:28:26] I answer your sphere of influence, you know,
[00:28:29] that's definitely.
[00:28:31] It's actually even more brilliant in a way
[00:28:34] that I'm thinking, at least from my perspective,
[00:28:36] because everybody who owns a home needs a will, right?
[00:28:39] So it's like every single person you work with
[00:28:42] could potentially be a referral to, I mean,
[00:28:44] it depends on what that estate planning attorney,
[00:28:46] what kind of client they want.
[00:28:47] But like every single person who owns a home
[00:28:50] should have some sort of a state plan in place,
[00:28:53] even if it's just some, you know, easy will that they could do.
[00:28:56] But it's a really smart because not everyone gets divorced.
[00:29:00] So it's, it's like, well, somebody's getting divorced.
[00:29:02] I can certainly refer them to my, to my, the attorney I like,
[00:29:05] but everybody needs an estate plan.
[00:29:07] So it's, it's actually, you,
[00:29:09] Everybody got to do two things.
[00:29:11] You got to pay taxes and you got to die.
[00:29:14] Those two things are, are,
[00:29:16] and we don't know when.
[00:29:18] Yeah. Yeah.
[00:29:19] 
[00:29:20] Let's, let's talk about, I want to talk about the state
[00:29:22] of the market today because you're a huge producer.
[00:29:25] And the market is, at least I'm in Chicago.
[00:29:28] We have about 800 agents here at our firm.
[00:29:31] All I hear about in our agents are great.
[00:29:34] I'm not here criticizing them at all,
[00:29:36] but I hear a lot of people being nervous about rate,
[00:29:42] where rates are with lending,
[00:29:43] obviously, are higher than,
[00:29:45] then I mean, they're always too high for anyone really,
[00:29:48] but they're certainly higher today than they were,
[00:29:50] you know, two, three years ago.
[00:29:51] And you know, we're approaching the sevens for,
[00:29:53] you know, almost 30 year fixes and fixed.
[00:29:56] And then, and then also inventory being because there's this
[00:30:01] disincentive to move right now, right?
[00:30:02] So if like, if I have a 3% mortgage, which I do,
[00:30:06] you'd have to really make a strong, not you,
[00:30:09] but, but a REALTOR would have to make a very strong case for me to go,
[00:30:11] I want to go from 3% to 7%, like that's a tough,
[00:30:15] tough thing to swallow, tough little swallow.
[00:30:18] What are you experiencing and how are you coaching
[00:30:22] some of your clients through this so that they're,
[00:30:26] so that they're can, it can make sense for them
[00:30:28] to make these decisions.
[00:30:30] Well, it's been, it's been tough
[00:30:33] and that it really is a double whammy
[00:30:36] because we're just coming off of COVID,
[00:30:40] you know, the pandemic surge,
[00:30:42] where a lot of people that were sort of teetering
[00:30:46] or on the fence about selling, you know,
[00:30:49] it was in their five year plan, let's say.
[00:30:52] And then this thing happens that drives the value of their,
[00:30:56] of their investment up to some 20, 30%
[00:31:01] and you're like, well, actually, I better cash in.
[00:31:04] So we had a lot in the last two, three years,
[00:31:07] we've seen a lot of that where people are,
[00:31:11] are caching in their chips.
[00:31:13] So you've got a pause in the,
[00:31:19] in the action of those,
[00:31:21] those people that would have been putting their homes
[00:31:24] on the market, they've already sold.
[00:31:26] So we've got, we're taking a hit from that side
[00:31:29] and then we're taking another from the interest rate side
[00:31:33] because like you said, I mean,
[00:31:36] people are sitting and join their two, three percent rates,
[00:31:40] but they're not seeing a dip in prices
[00:31:43] to incentivize them to, if they wanna, you know,
[00:31:47] look downsize, get something bigger, if they want, you know,
[00:31:51] we're just not, it's just not,
[00:31:53] there's no incentive for them to move
[00:31:56] unless you're moving to an entirely different area
[00:32:00] or if you, you know, let's say you're in a certain zip code
[00:32:04] because of the school system and, you know,
[00:32:07] you wanna move to a town where,
[00:32:10] or a different part of the country
[00:32:12] where the cost of living is much different.
[00:32:15] It's, or it's really like,
[00:32:19] it's not a choice, like you got to move
[00:32:22] because of your job or because of a divorce or a death,
[00:32:25] it's just, you know, one of those instances.
[00:32:28] So we're really suffering with the inventory
[00:32:31] and buyers are frustrated.
[00:32:34] It's a really tough time.
[00:32:36] I mean, I can't even imagine, you know,
[00:32:43] I'm working with buyers right now that are in, you know,
[00:32:46] and I've got buyers that are in the 5 million plus range
[00:32:49] and then I've got several buyers that are in like,
[00:32:52] one to three range.
[00:32:55] And the one to three range is just forget it.
[00:33:00] It is so, so much competition.
[00:33:02] So much competition and they're in there going in,
[00:33:05] they're putting in offers, they're waving contingencies,
[00:33:09] you know, mortgage contingency,
[00:33:11] a pravile contingency inspection contingency, forget it.
[00:33:15] You know, we'll pay, like we'll pay off cash,
[00:33:18] we'll close when you want, we'll like, you know,
[00:33:22] we'll put a statue of your family in the backyard
[00:33:25] for the rest of the end of time for us to worship at your feet.
[00:33:30] I mean, you, but you're going against 30 other applicants
[00:33:34] like there, that you are in a bidding work amongst,
[00:33:38] you know, there are literally, we're going against
[00:33:42] 20, 25 different things.
[00:33:45] So how do you win?
[00:33:47] I mean, it is so, so tough.
[00:33:50] So a lot of times like right now,
[00:33:53] when I'm doing with my buyers,
[00:33:54] I'm looking at, you know, expired listings.
[00:33:58] I'm looking at, you know, I'm locking on doors.
[00:34:01] I'm trying to go off market because once you get involved
[00:34:06] with all of that craziness, when you are,
[00:34:12] first two, four weeks to market on the MLS,
[00:34:16] if you're priced appropriately,
[00:34:17] it's going to be a madhouse.
[00:34:20] I mean, if you're overpriced, you're overpriced
[00:34:22] and that's that you can't do anything about that.
[00:34:24] But like, if you're, you know, you're listing a mat
[00:34:28] in the one to three range,
[00:34:30] it is going to be an absolute zoo
[00:34:32] and you're competing against the same people
[00:34:35] over and over and over again,
[00:34:37] and it's incredibly frustrating.
[00:34:39] Are there any, any tips you have to stand out in those offers?
[00:34:44] Any suggestions of, you know, obviously,
[00:34:47] you don't have a ton of control over all those multiple offers,
[00:34:50] but just anything that has helped you get a little bit of an edge
[00:34:55] when you're submitting, you know, an offer
[00:34:57] that you know is getting a dozen or more other offers.
[00:35:01] Well, so again, this is where relationships do play a big part
[00:35:06] because when you start to do a lot of business
[00:35:09] in a certain market, you get to know all the players, right?
[00:35:11] So like, if I know the listing broker,
[00:35:15] I know I've got an advantage
[00:35:17] because I can talk, or even better yet,
[00:35:21] if I've done a deal with that listing broker
[00:35:23] and we know each other, we can trust each other,
[00:35:26] then I know that I can go,
[00:35:28] I can talk with that listing broker more frankly
[00:35:32] and get more information for my client than some, than an unknown.
[00:35:37] So that's where experience really is crucial.
[00:35:41] Like you want to work with someone
[00:35:42] who's been around the block a few times to,
[00:35:47] because knowing the landscape, knowing the players
[00:35:50] really makes a huge difference
[00:35:53] because if it's between you and your client
[00:35:57] or, you know, Joe Schmo that from some firm you've never heard of,
[00:36:02] with the exact same offer, you're gonna win.
[00:36:05] Yeah.
[00:36:05] Right, you're gonna get it.
[00:36:07] So I would say that does play a part for sure.
[00:36:13] The other thing I recommend doing is, you know,
[00:36:16] the family resume always helps like that cheesy kind of,
[00:36:22] like we love your house and we-
[00:36:24] Like the love letter, yeah.
[00:36:26] Right, and the photos with the family and like, you know,
[00:36:30] because people, you know, homes are very,
[00:36:33] they're very sentimental meaningful things
[00:36:36] to people who've raised a family in a home
[00:36:39] and spent decades of their life caring for this home.
[00:36:44] They really want to make sure that that home goes
[00:36:48] to somebody who's going to do the same thing, you know.
[00:36:52] That's just, it's almost like,
[00:36:54] there is such a powerful emotional connection
[00:36:59] to a home that you've lived in and raised your family in.
[00:37:03] And you really, you don't want to sell that home
[00:37:05] until like a developer, you know, or some investor,
[00:37:11] like somebody representing like a, some guy in, you know,
[00:37:17] and some Russian oligarch or something, sorry.
[00:37:22] You know, like if you're a nice, nice,
[00:37:25] if you're a nice people that have, you know,
[00:37:28] like you wanna, you like the school system,
[00:37:31] you're a nice family, you absolutely wanna present that
[00:37:35] to the sellers.
[00:37:37] And there is, you can get an edge.
[00:37:40] I mean, I just, we just experienced this recently
[00:37:44] with a deal that I'm doing at the moment
[00:37:50] in Bedford, New York and Westchester County.
[00:37:53] It was between my people and,
[00:37:58] and, or it was gonna go to this developer
[00:38:01] who actually had put in a higher offer than we did.
[00:38:05] But this is, you know, they're young couple,
[00:38:09] they wanna raise a family in this home.
[00:38:12] They love so, this is another thing that's,
[00:38:16] this is a tip that people love getting compliments
[00:38:20] on the work that they've done
[00:38:22] or the upgrades that they've done on the home.
[00:38:25] So, you know, knowing like this was in 1930,
[00:38:30] just almost, it's a gorgeous home.
[00:38:34] But they did so much work to it,
[00:38:37] upgrading it, decorating it and painting
[00:38:41] and the moldings and the chandelier
[00:38:44] and they did all the fireplaces over.
[00:38:47] They really did a wonderful job.
[00:38:49] So, we wanted to just throw,
[00:38:53] we wanted to tell them what a brilliant job
[00:38:55] that they had done, how much we loved the,
[00:39:00] the materials that they used in their kitchen.
[00:39:03] And we love the kitchen island that granite.
[00:39:06] It's like, you know, get detailed.
[00:39:09] People love that stuff.
[00:39:11] They love like painting.
[00:39:13] They, you know, why do we do anything, right?
[00:39:16] Like why do we renovate our kitchens and bathrooms
[00:39:19] and put all this stuff on the wall?
[00:39:22] Cause we want people our guests to come in and say,
[00:39:26] ooh, wow, great.
[00:39:28] I'm like, that's why we do it, right?
[00:39:30] So like to get that recognition to get that kind of,
[00:39:34] like that's going to get,
[00:39:36] that's going to work in your favor.
[00:39:38] People do appreciate that.
[00:39:39] What percentage, what would you guess?
[00:39:42] Cause you are up against multiple offers,
[00:39:44] of course, in the price ranges you're at.
[00:39:48] And, you know, you're coming in with some of the more
[00:39:52] human parts of it that like, ooh,
[00:39:54] we really love what you did with the kitchen, the blah, blah.
[00:39:56] You know, and you can talk about that
[00:39:58] or even maybe the buying couple can record a little video
[00:40:01] or type out a letter or, you know,
[00:40:04] hey, oh my God, it's so amazing.
[00:40:07] What percentage of offers do you think do that?
[00:40:10] Is it, it's, I know it was more popular during the pandemic
[00:40:14] when there were so many offers
[00:40:16] where it was like you had to do something to stand out,
[00:40:18] but now that that's subsided,
[00:40:19] but inventory is still low and there's a lot
[00:40:21] of multiple offers now.
[00:40:22] Is that a common thing or is that just something
[00:40:24] that like, I imagine most REALTORS don't do that.
[00:40:27] They just put in the offer, see what happens.
[00:40:30] Yeah, I guess it depends, you know, on the deal.
[00:40:33] It depends on, you know, like, for example,
[00:40:37] if I'm representing one of those estates
[00:40:40] from the, you know, referral from a state attorney,
[00:40:42] like those kids in Wisconsin, they just want,
[00:40:45] they want to divvy up the mud,
[00:40:46] they got it split up for a ways they don't care.
[00:40:49] Or something, you know, it doesn't work all of it,
[00:40:51] but that's not all the time.
[00:40:54] I guess it's it, I would apply it as needed.
[00:40:56] It's a situational kind of a vibe, vibe out.
[00:41:02] You gotta suck it out and see when it's appropriate
[00:41:05] and when it's appropriate.
[00:41:07] And of course, like if it's appropriate for your client too,
[00:41:11] because maybe you're not representing a really nice family,
[00:41:14] like maybe you are representing, you know,
[00:41:17] an investor or somebody that wants to put a sub-divided
[00:41:23] or do all or gut it or who knows.
[00:41:27] So it really, it's that sort of a, yeah,
[00:41:31] apply as needed as what, as how I would phrase that.
[00:41:36] And that's something that a good broker can vibe out.
[00:41:42] And especially if you are,
[00:41:44] if you've worked without listing broker before,
[00:41:48] you know, that's in the due diligence information gathering stage,
[00:41:52] a good broker should be able to guide you through that.
[00:41:56] Yeah, no, for sure.
[00:41:58] I love that tip is if we think that the sellers
[00:42:02] have an emotional attachment to the upgrades they've made,
[00:42:07] that can be something that the agent can ask the other agent,
[00:42:10] hey, my client really loves what you guys did with the kitchen.
[00:42:14] And then they can, you know, can figure out how much you want
[00:42:17] to press that in the offer.
[00:42:20] But certainly people are always loved to be complimented
[00:42:24] on their work.
[00:42:25] So that is, you know, even even if it doesn't win the,
[00:42:29] win the bid, it certainly is a, is a good practice to compliment
[00:42:34] people on what they've done right with their house.
[00:42:38] Because also if they're like most of us, I think most of us,
[00:42:42] like we look in the mirror and we see the little imperfections
[00:42:45] in ourselves.
[00:42:46] And I think most people think about that way with their home as well.
[00:42:49] It's like, yeah, I did this project,
[00:42:51] but then there's like 10 other projects I had didn't get to.
[00:42:53] So most people look at their home and they're like, Oh, God,
[00:42:55] I have so many things I have to do and I haven't done.
[00:42:57] And then when somebody comes in and it's like, Oh, that thing you did
[00:42:59] is really cool.
[00:43:00] It's like, Oh, yeah, that's right.
[00:43:01] I did do that thing.
[00:43:02] And that's really it's a nice little reminder.
[00:43:05] Yeah.
[00:43:06] I mean, your home is yet an extension of yourself.
[00:43:08] And it's a representation of yourself.
[00:43:11] Absolutely.
[00:43:12] And just like you said, we look, we, when we're living in it,
[00:43:16] we don't see how that we look and see the flaws.
[00:43:20] And we think everyone's going to comment and say like,
[00:43:23] that is like the wall color sheep.
[00:43:27] Like that, you know, I remember when I first got my first apartment on the
[00:43:32] Upper West side and I stained the floors really dark.
[00:43:37] You know, so I was like this prewar apartment and like the walls were
[00:43:43] this really high ceiling with like these moldings beautiful,
[00:43:47] like a classic six apartment on the Upper West side.
[00:43:51] And I stained them like I just went for it.
[00:43:56] I stand in like a bany color, you know, so really shiny and kind of
[00:44:01] contrasted the white walls and everything.
[00:44:03] But of course, I was like, Oh, God, is it like so?
[00:44:09] Is it too dark?
[00:44:10] Like did I put the right shade?
[00:44:13] And I remember like walking, I would, I would walk in to get my first impression
[00:44:18] of the place and then walk back out and then walk back in to like get a fresh.
[00:44:24] Like I must have, I probably did that 20 times.
[00:44:28] And you know, my husband at the time was probably like, Oh my God,
[00:44:33] she's, she's totally gone.
[00:44:36] Deserk, but it was that first brand that came over.
[00:44:40] I remember her name's Eve.
[00:44:42] We went to college together.
[00:44:43] She came over and she said, I love your floors.
[00:44:47] And then you never had to think about it again.
[00:44:49] And it was like, Oh my God, God bless.
[00:44:52] Like, yeah, it's just, yeah, you need affirmation.
[00:44:55] We all, we all love and need affirmation.
[00:44:59] Well, I have, I have an all white condo.
[00:45:02] Everything's white or in like white and black, the fixtures are black, you know,
[00:45:07] but like the counter tops the floor is light.
[00:45:10] All the walls are white.
[00:45:11] And I can't wait for like 10 years from now, somebody will walk in and go,
[00:45:15] what were they thinking?
[00:45:17] Because everything changes, you know, at some point, like the all white thing will
[00:45:21] just not be cool anymore.
[00:45:22] And everything is going to look goofy at some point in history.
[00:45:26] So it's funny.
[00:45:28] So, you know, I just, I'm looking forward to that kind of,
[00:45:32] because I remember when I bought my condo before in 2005 and we were doing certain
[00:45:36] things with granite and that was real popular.
[00:45:38] And now it's like, we look at those goofy granite, some of the goofy or granite
[00:45:42] colors were like, what were they thinking?
[00:45:43] It's like, no, that was in back in 2005.
[00:45:46] And now, you know, the white thing has kind of been in for the last five years.
[00:45:50] And it's probably on its way out.
[00:45:51] And it was like, it's up.
[00:45:52] We reached floors that was not how to ride.
[00:45:55] I was like, you know, those like leech wood and nan tuckety kind of shingles and
[00:46:01] that like everything's just like been in the sun for too long kind of.
[00:46:06] It is, it is funny, but it is, it's important.
[00:46:09] I think agents sometimes forget that that like there are real,
[00:46:14] if you're representing buyers, there's real human beings on the stellar side.
[00:46:17] And if you have a good relationship with that, with the listing agent.
[00:46:22] And that's where it's really important to play nice in the sandbox, right?
[00:46:25] It's like always.
[00:46:26] And look, I know, especially I think women get, I mean, I don't want to generalize based on gender,
[00:46:32] but I think women get this much worse than men is that there's just a lot of jerks
[00:46:36] that are REALTORS in the industry too.
[00:46:38] And I know a lot of women who are very successful in real estate who are like,
[00:46:42] you would not believe the way I get spoken to by other REALTORS on a regular basis.
[00:46:47] Like nice, nice, you see, you're not in your head.
[00:46:50] And it's like, well, who could ever be mean to Sarah?
[00:46:52] She's like a lovely sweet person.
[00:46:54] Oh, she has to deal with this too.
[00:46:56] And the reality of it is, it only is ultimately going to hurt the other agent
[00:46:59] if they're a jerk to you because you're not going to forget that.
[00:47:03] Yeah.
[00:47:03] I mean, especially like the whole like listing broker buying broker dynamic.
[00:47:09] Like if you're the listing broker, you are like too cool for school.
[00:47:14] Like you are, you know, you should be grateful if you get a return phone call
[00:47:18] from the listing broker.
[00:47:21] Like it's just that's the market that we're in right now.
[00:47:25] It's a seller's market, right?
[00:47:26] So like if you want to be on the sell side and like we're all the buyer side,
[00:47:32] we're all sweating away.
[00:47:34] Like please, can we show it?
[00:47:37] Oh, you'll let us like you just have to be so nice and, you know,
[00:47:42] catch more flies with honey type thing.
[00:47:45] And the listing broker stuff, it's like,
[00:47:49] like can we just lose the attitude?
[00:47:52] You know, like I, it's just like pleat.
[00:47:55] I don't understand it.
[00:47:57] You know, like it's one of those like, you know, when there's like an event
[00:48:02] for a cocktail for brokers or network event for brokers and people are like,
[00:48:06] why am I going to go to that?
[00:48:07] I don't want to meet a bunch of brokers.
[00:48:09] Like I'm not selling a broker's.
[00:48:11] And it's like, uh, no, you go to those, you go to all those cocktail parties.
[00:48:16] You, you meet everybody, you handshake, you throw cards up because you never
[00:48:21] know when that relationship is going to be important.
[00:48:25] And the thing your network, you know, the more that that business is going,
[00:48:29] it's going to inevitably build.
[00:48:31] If you put it out there, it's going to build.
[00:48:34] Yes.
[00:48:35] And you, you could not be more, more accurate there.
[00:48:38] And I've just heard that said over the years on the show by just about every
[00:48:43] person we've ever had on is, is be really, really nice to other agents.
[00:48:48] And also realize that other agents might be having a bad day too and give them a
[00:48:53] bit of grace when they falter and maybe are less than professional,
[00:48:58] even though that's never acceptable to be less than professional, but it happens.
[00:49:02] And it's one of those things where, um, you know, the, the top agents I know,
[00:49:09] kind of learn how to grin and bear it a little bit more.
[00:49:12] It's not quite as personal to them when somebody's awful to them.
[00:49:16] And obviously that sucks.
[00:49:17] Where to ever have somebody be awful to anybody.
[00:49:20] But this idea of like, I'm just going to catalog that.
[00:49:23] I'm going to remember that.
[00:49:25] And, you know, maybe in the future, that maybe won't serve that person that was
[00:49:29] crappy to me.
[00:49:29] Maybe, maybe, maybe, oh, but I, you know, and, and we all want to.
[00:49:34] Karma happen.
[00:49:35] It's a car.
[00:49:35] McWorthen function.
[00:49:36] It happens.
[00:49:37] And especially, you know, in a market like Grunitsch, where, you know,
[00:49:43] it's a, it's a big market, but there are a few very strong players that you'll,
[00:49:48] you'll see again and again.
[00:49:50] And, um, and, you know, and that, the beauty of our business too is like,
[00:49:56] a deal has a beginning and an end, right?
[00:49:59] Like you can tolerate anybody for it through the, the length of time that it
[00:50:04] takes to, to sign a contract and get to a closing.
[00:50:10] It's not like you're going to have to go to a nine to five job and see this person
[00:50:14] every day for the rest of your life, you know, like, they, when the deal is done,
[00:50:19] the deal is done.
[00:50:20] And that's what I love.
[00:50:21] I love like the sense of, of completion, the, of achievement of, of finale,
[00:50:28] you know, it's over.
[00:50:29] So you can move on to the next one, but you just need to make it through.
[00:50:34] That can make it keep everybody happy so we get to the finish line.
[00:50:38] I, I agree.
[00:50:40] I think that is, that makes all the sense in the world.
[00:50:43] Um, one thing I wanted to mention because I know we're, we're kind of running
[00:50:47] coming up on near the end of our, our time.
[00:50:50] I was, um, thinking about, um, your, you know, what you're, oh, I, I know I
[00:50:57] wanted to ask you, it was about what you do in between your deals.
[00:51:00] So you just talked about like there's a beginning and an end to the relationship.
[00:51:03] You know, some, some clients are easier to work with than others.
[00:51:06] Some you're like, I can't wait to be the, this person's friend forever.
[00:51:09] And others are like, you know, um, that was a nice experience.
[00:51:12] And we don't need to, you know, keep, keep, you know, keep, keep, uh, communicating.
[00:51:16] But what do you do in between those transactions so that the clients
[00:51:21] don't forget about you, right?
[00:51:23] Like, obviously you can't be friends with everybody.
[00:51:25] Um, but are you doing, because you know, if somebody's only really
[00:51:29] utilizing you every, let's say five to seven years or whatever the cycle is in
[00:51:33] your area, um, what are you doing so that they don't forget?
[00:51:36] Oh, who did we use five years ago?
[00:51:37] Not that you're forgettable.
[00:51:38] You are not forgettable.
[00:51:39] But let's assume that we're all forgettable.
[00:51:41] You know, we're all, we're all forgettable.
[00:51:43] Um, and, and so, you know, we, what, what are you doing to make sure your clients
[00:51:48] don't forget you?
[00:51:49] I mean, you got to do all the stuff to stay top of mind, right?
[00:51:53] Like we all know the stuff.
[00:51:55] It's just there.
[00:51:55] It's, it's a, it's not, this is the gritty pan in the ass stuff that we all,
[00:52:01] it's all like we're not looking forward to it.
[00:52:05] We don't love coming up in your inbox all the time and being so annoying and
[00:52:10] videos, not, you know, like being in your face type thing.
[00:52:14] But it really, it, it matters.
[00:52:17] It's important.
[00:52:18] Like you have to stay top of mind.
[00:52:20] And that means we continuously marketing yourself, reaching out, you know,
[00:52:28] to, to your network.
[00:52:29] Um, blasting out those emails, sending postcards, social media, obviously,
[00:52:36] is incredibly important.
[00:52:38] And I always say it's more, it's more like if, if it's not like you're,
[00:52:43] I personally don't get my, my phone's not ringing off the hook from my social media.
[00:52:49] You know, it's not like someone's looking at a TikTok that I made and like,
[00:52:54] oh my god, Sarah, like it's you.
[00:52:57] You are the one you have to sell our, but it, what it does provide is like,
[00:53:03] it's a, um, when they go to do some due diligence on you and they go to check
[00:53:08] you out, a would be client, they're, they're going to see all that stuff.
[00:53:12] And they're going to feel nice and safe and snugly found that they're in
[00:53:17] good hands with, with you.
[00:53:19] Like, so that stuff all really, it accumulates.
[00:53:23] It makes you, as the time goes on and you've got more, more history,
[00:53:27] it's, it's all the better.
[00:53:29] So you really just, you can't be afraid to put yourself out there.
[00:53:33] And I know that that's so, it's not easy to do.
[00:53:37] It's, it's like, it's really, it, you got to take the good, but the bad,
[00:53:41] when it comes to that stuff, but you really, it's in this day and age,
[00:53:45] and it's crucial to not only maintaining your business, but really growing your
[00:53:50] business. You, you need to stay, uh, relevant to the conversation.
[00:53:56] It also gives people access, right?
[00:53:58] Like it allows people to feel like they have a connection with you,
[00:54:02] even at three in the morning, when you're asleep, if they're awake,
[00:54:05] scrolling through Instagram or wherever and they're now seeing like, Oh,
[00:54:10] oh, that's a, maybe I know Sarah or maybe I don't.
[00:54:12] Maybe I'm being introduced to her through a TikTok or whatever,
[00:54:15] but it allows people access to you more about you without you having to make
[00:54:21] pick up the phone and, and you know, call, make these cold calls, which you've
[00:54:25] done, you've done cold walking, you've done a lot of these more difficult,
[00:54:28] um, you know, sort of cold introductions, whereas, you know, social media is a
[00:54:33] great way for people just to remember, might be reminded of what you do,
[00:54:37] right? So it's like, you can continually pump out content about all this cool
[00:54:42] stuff you're doing in real estate in, in sort of the thought that like the
[00:54:46] right people will see it.
[00:54:47] My followers might see it, that at least be reminded I'm still in the game
[00:54:50] and doing x, y and z for, for as a REALTOR. Um, so I, I think for it's,
[00:54:55] it's a lot of just a branding thing, right? It's like, it's not, it's more than
[00:54:58] that. But I think from a branding perspective, it's, you know, we know most
[00:55:02] people scroll, uh, you know, scroll in, in some sort of social media channel,
[00:55:06] uh, once or twice during the day, might as well be one of the things they come
[00:55:11] across, right? Exactly. And I mean, if you're not doing it, somebody else is
[00:55:16] doing it. I can guarantee you that. And like, and the more that we are in,
[00:55:20] in an online business, you know, I mean, I think Zilla was a real game
[00:55:27] changer in, in the way that we, um, we have the availability of, of
[00:55:34] understanding your market and, and knowing what's on the market. Um, we didn't
[00:55:40] have this pretty 2000. I mean, the, the client had to slowly rely on the
[00:55:47] REALTOR to show you what was available on the market at that time. So now,
[00:55:54] they have access to pretty much almost every platform that you do. So how are
[00:56:02] you going to add value to that, for example, you know, how, how are you going
[00:56:06] to enhance that experience for them or provide, provide them an experience
[00:56:14] buying or selling a home that, and a, a different agent can't, you know,
[00:56:18] yeah. So that's really, you got to find exactly that your brand, your vision.
[00:56:24] What's really cool is you get to lean into that now. Whatever your thing is,
[00:56:28] like, could be outside of real estate even, maybe you're passionate about
[00:56:32] something a hobby or, you know, particular belief system or group or whatever.
[00:56:37] You're just into X. And what's really cool as an agent with social media,
[00:56:42] one of the good parts of social media is you get to not only find all the
[00:56:46] other people that are into X, but even if you don't have a community of people
[00:56:50] that are into the same thing you are, you can start posting about that on your
[00:56:54] real estate page. If you're really into something, maybe it tangentially relates
[00:56:58] to real estate or maybe it doesn't, but if you're into surfing or whatever you
[00:57:02] might be into, you know, you can do that. And then people start to feel like,
[00:57:07] oh, that's pretty cool. This is what this versus it to. And you'll,
[00:57:09] and you can start attracting, you know, surfers or a people who are in that
[00:57:13] space, simply by posting a lot of good quality content that a
[00:57:18] surfer might want or that somebody that's across that or whatever it might
[00:57:21] be. Right. And you get to be yourself, which is really cool.
[00:57:25] Blow up an entire different demographic that you wouldn't have had access to.
[00:57:32] And that's like this job, you're always working, even when you're socializing
[00:57:38] and just generally having fun, you know, like you're actually, you're working.
[00:57:43] You're always, you're meeting people, you're interacting with people.
[00:57:48] It's an opportunity to let that person know who you are and what you do,
[00:57:54] you know, so that's why it's so important to, I mean, obviously working
[00:58:01] your career is important. But when I'm, you know, playing tennis or I'm
[00:58:07] playing pickle ball, or even if I'm going to, you know, an event, a
[00:58:11] fancy granite, a gala or something like that, that's always an
[00:58:17] opportunity to connect with somebody and to grow your business. So like,
[00:58:23] it's a kind of a cool way to not feel guilty sometimes, like sometimes when,
[00:58:28] you know, you're doing something that's not work, work, work, work, you're like,
[00:58:33] but really when I'm, I mean, I've gotten a lot of business from playing tennis
[00:58:37] because we women love to chat when we're playing a double match, like we're on
[00:58:43] the on the changeover. And like, who doesn't love to talk about real estate?
[00:58:48] You know, like, everyone's got to live somewhere. Right. And like,
[00:58:52] it's such, it's so easy to casually be like, Oh my God, you guys, this showing
[00:58:57] that I had earlier today, let me tell you. And they'll lean right in the,
[00:59:02] the, they want to know. And my goal is always to make sure not don't ever leave
[00:59:08] any social situation without them knowing that I'm a REALTOR. Like that's
[00:59:14] all I have to do. That's all you have to do. I don't, I don't need to push it
[00:59:18] down there. I don't want to ram it down their throat and ask them where they
[00:59:21] live. And are they interested in selling in the next five years?
[00:59:26] You know, all I need to do is have them register that somewhere in their
[00:59:32] peripheral that, Oh, I played tennis with this lady and she's a real estate
[00:59:37] broker. And you just don't know how that's going to Germany, you know,
[00:59:43] and it might, and it might be that like that person's brother is a real
[00:59:48] tor. And so you're not going to get that business, but they might say, Oh, my
[00:59:51] friend, you need to talk to my friend, she would be awesome because, you know,
[00:59:55] so yeah, you're right, you never know where it's going to germinate. I love
[00:59:58] what you just said, every, your job is as a marketer part of being a REALTOR
[01:00:05] is to make sure that everybody who you come across that you interact with
[01:00:09] understands what you do for a living. It does, right, pushing is always, to
[01:00:13] me, I'm not a big fan of people. But I want to know, I want to know what
[01:00:17] all of my friends do. I want to know where they work. Like I haven't, I've
[01:00:21] an interest in that when I meet somebody, you know, oftentimes what they do
[01:00:24] for a living might be the least interesting thing. But I still ask and I still
[01:00:27] am like, Oh, what are you into? What do you do? That's really, really important.
[01:00:31] We shouldn't be, again, it and also everyone's got to live somewhere. So they're
[01:00:35] going to need a REALTOR anyway. So you might as well, it's not like you're
[01:00:38] trying to sell them aluminum siding or something that they may or may not need
[01:00:41] or want. Right? You're not selling something that's not important. You're
[01:00:45] actually like, well, you're going to use a REALTOR anyway. So it's a good
[01:00:47] idea to make sure that people know that that's what I do. So I want to end with
[01:00:52] that because I think that is such an important, create an important thing. For
[01:00:57] everyone listening, let's make it a goal that everybody in your life this year
[01:01:01] is going to get some sort of reach out from you in a gentle way to remind
[01:01:06] them that you are in the business and you can figure out the best way to do
[01:01:10] that. Everyone's got their own individual style. Make sure that everybody in
[01:01:14] your end that you're consistently dripping something on them. Maybe not
[01:01:18] every week, maybe not every even month, but a few times a year at a minimum,
[01:01:22] they're getting some sort of reminder that you are a REALTOR. So Sarah, thank
[01:01:27] you so much. And I also want to say for everyone before, before leaving, don't
[01:01:30] leave you shut because I would like to remind everyone that Sarah is always,
[01:01:37] as we talked about having relationships with other REALTORS, Sarah gets a lot of
[01:01:41] her business from referrals because she's just that good. So if you have any
[01:01:46] clients that are moving in and out of Connecticut, even parts of New York,
[01:01:51] it doesn't even matter where. Just reach out to Sarah. She can't help you. She'll
[01:01:55] know who to refer to, but she would love to connect with you specifically around
[01:02:00] Connecticut, parts of New York as well. So we're talking Fairfield County,
[01:02:05] Greenwich Westport Westchester County, Westchester County, right up
[01:02:08] to the city. Those are my wheelhouses and I love referrals. I think you'll,
[01:02:17] you would, I never chance me with referral fees. And Sarah's clients oftentimes
[01:02:25] have other homes elsewhere or move. So if you are in an area that people may be
[01:02:31] retired to, you know, or Florida, Florida is the big one. Yeah. So let's,
[01:02:37] let's, you know, this, this is a two way street sort of scenario. So definitely
[01:02:41] reach out to Sarah. Also, if you're a REALTOR in Connecticut and you're like,
[01:02:45] God, I would love to work with someone like Sarah. I would love for her to be
[01:02:49] on, to be on her team and learn from her. She learned from one of the best. You
[01:02:53] can learn from her. She's one of the best now. So, you know, reap now,
[01:02:56] obviously, she's, they can't take everyone. But if you think you could add value
[01:03:01] to her team or if you think, you know, she could add value to your business,
[01:03:05] reach out to her. This is, well, let's, let's build a relationship. So Sarah,
[01:03:09] if there is another REALTOR who wants to connect with you either for referral
[01:03:12] or maybe they're interested in looking at Douglas element or your team,
[01:03:15] what's the best way they should reach out to you? Well, they can always,
[01:03:18] they can find me on my Insta, which is at Sarah Stone style. And if not that,
[01:03:24] you know, my, my cell phone, my, my email, which I don't know if you can provide

[01:03:49] The total pleasure. I can chat with you all day. Yeah, it was, it was so much fun.

OK, tonight, my guest is Sarah Stone from Douglas element. She's in Fairfield. County, Connecticut, Greenwich, Westport, and also in New York and Westchester as well. Let me tell you more about Sarah. Sarah, this is really an impressive biography. So I really want you guys to clue in on this because we're gonna touch about a lot of what I'm about to mention here. So Sarah was a top producing broker at Douglas Elements Manhattan office at 575 Madison Avenue for a decade. She was rookie of the year during her tenure there in Manhattan. She sold many, many high profile properties, including 65th East 76th, 800 Park Avenue, and the world famous Dakota building, which is at one west 72nd. She has now taken her experience, knowledge, and famed sales experience and expanded it from New York into the Connecticut suburbs, specializing in the purchase and sale of fine homes in both Fairfield and Westchester counties. Sarah also has a fine eye for exterior interior design. She's an expert in staging and decorating a home. She's resided and raised children in both Bedford, New York and Greenwich, Connecticut. She is the perfect guide to find or sell your own suburban splendor. A former nationally ranked tennis player, which I would love to ask a few questions to improve my own game. Sarah spends her free time playing tennis and also pickable. And I do wanna talk about pickable because I am, the noise of it is my only issue with pickable is noise, but it is a fun game. In one of Greenwich's most beautiful town parks or clubs, Sarah can also be spotted driving around in her vintage Mercedes convertible. I want everybody to follow Sarah on her Instagram. She has an amazing Instagram following Sarah Stone style. So S, S, S Sarah with an H stone style. We will, so at Sarah Stone style, we'll have a link to that in the show notes and also a link to her Douglas Elliman website. Definitely check her out on social. She does some really super cool things. Sarah, welcome to the show. Well, thank you. That was an extraordinary intro. I really appreciate that. Thank you very much. We really appreciate you coming on. Thank you. We appreciate you and coming on our show is a big deal for us. We know just how busy top producers like you are and it's been the biggest and loveliest surprise for me as starting the show like five or six years ago in thinking, oh, none of these top producers are ever going to have time for this. And yet here we are like 500 episodes later and still being able to get top producers like you to give us some time that I know is in short supply for you. So thank you, thank you. Absolutely, my pleasure. Let's start at the beginning. So how did you get into real estate and why? So my journey to real estate actually started, I'd say fairly early on relatively speaking, I graduated with a degree in economics from Tulane University down south. And I, at that time, my goal was let's, let me get a job that will make me the most amount of money the quickest. I wasn't like, what's my passion? I'm one of my good at it. I was like, let me get into Wall Street and let's get cracking. Sure. And that's what I did. I worked for a mutual fund called Lord Abbott. That was my first. Sure. Sure. That I was in the GM building on 58th Street right across from the Plaza Hotel. And I got my Series 7, my Series 7 and 63. I had those both as well. My first job as a financial advisor. So I know that world. Yeah. So I was working as, I was selling, working with regional managers to sell our various funds. And I did that for a little bit there. And then I moved on to another bank, DLJ, which is back from that sort of a 90s, was a boutique kind of bank back then that was bought by Credit Suisse First Boston while I was there. When, as I was working at DLJ, I worked at the registered sales assistant for the bigger brokers, retail brokers there. And it's a very fast, hasty pressure, male dominated, especially that. Sell, sell, sell, business. And it's frantically paced, although not to say that this business isn't. But it was just, it was something like, oh, did I kick the right thing for me? And this is when my introspective examination of my thoughts and goals really untrurally were. And this is another bit of diversion. But I was always into, I wanted to be into acting, theater, modeling, and that kind of thing. So I said, okay, I'm going to try, I'm going to go for all that stuff. I'm going to go for my dreams, but the pay isn't so great when you're starting out. So I said, I'm going to subsidize that with, I'll be also some real estate on the side. I had gone through the process of renting an apartment in Manhattan. And I saw, I got a little bit of a window into how all that worked. And I asked my broker a lot of questions. And in Manhattan, especially, I mean, you're paying back then, you're paying a 15% commission to the two-year broker at the end. Yeah, let's talk about this. Let's pause for a second because this is a very important distinction. What Sarah's like, oh, okay, I really am acting, modeling. I want to pursue that. And I'll do some real estate on the side. What she, what if you don't know rentals in New York City, one of the things that she's explaining right now, and I apologize for being rude and interrupting, but I want to make sure everyone understands this. It's very different from pretty much every major market. Maybe Boston's a little bit this way too. But Boston in New York, I think, are the only two markets that do this, where oftentimes the renter pays the commission, which is a tough sell, right? That is hard. Oh, by the way, I need an extra $5,000. It is. Yeah, on top of, I mean, you know, on top of first month, last month. First month, last month, and your security deposit. And here's another 15% of the year's rent. So yeah, definitely it was something that I made note of when I was going through the process, like, oh, doing the math, you know, let's see. And this is just rentals, you know, I wasn't even thinking about the sales game then. So I had sort of a connection at Douglas Salomon. And they, well, you know, they said, let's give a shot, do your thing. And that first year, I made 10 times what I made doing the acting modeling gig in real estate. So amazing. I found that I really had a knack for it. And not only that, I really enjoyed, I enjoyed getting, because I just love New York City so much. And I found that I really had so much passion for just checking it all out and getting to know all the different neighborhoods. And, you know, and like, how great is that? Like, my job is just kind of cruising around the city and checking out all kind, I mean, especially in those early days, you wouldn't believe like what I was, wasn't all glamour, trust me. I was, you know, I was trying like to sell this studio that was above subway, sandwich shop that smelled like bread all the time. That's subway bread. I still to this day. I can't. It's burned into my sense memory. I get locked into a subway. I can't, it just takes me back to like, you know, I was probably, I must have shown that thing over 50 times. So I spend a lot of time in that apartment. But that's sort of like how it was, it was definitely the money was great at that time. And it was, I found that I really enjoyed it and it was something that I was really good at. So I just sort of morphed more and more making that into my full-time occupation. And so you really built your career in the city and then you've then made, eventually made a move. And so essentially, I mean, it wasn't like you moved across the country so it was neighboring, but still far enough away where it's a different world, at least a bit of a different world. And having to sort of start over essentially is in incredible. It's almost like, it's almost like an attorney who passes the bar in New York. And then all of a sudden it's like, you know, I think I really want to live in Arizona. It's like, well, they don't have to, they no have to go do it all over again in Arizona. Right, right, right. You know, and so you essentially had a similar kind of experience where you were moving from Manhattan, which is insanely a challenging market to be a REALTOR and whether you're doing rentals, sales. I've interviewed tons of people, even from your firm, who work in New York, how challenging, of course we all know how challenging it is. And then to then go somewhere else and say, I'm just like to start all over essentially. And again, I understand it's not completely starting over, but essentially it is. So that is even more amazing is that you've sort of, you were rookie of the year in New York and then back into the suburbs as your life changed. And so what was that transition like, like going to a new market, a new area and trying to build your business again? Well, it was, I was, I'm very grateful for my firm, Douglas Aliment, because that, the fact that they are the biggest mover of real estate in Manhattan and they had opened up an element office in Greenwich about five years prior to my joining. So they had nice established referral thing going on on their own. I stepped in with some, a lot of pre-existing relationships with brokers that I had worked with in Manhattan while I was there. And while I was in the city, I should mention, I worked in three different offices while I was there. I was at 575, but I was also on the upper west side for a little bit. I worked at 980 Madison for a little while. So I really got to know a lot of brokers and in this business you'll find, I mean, people go 20 years in this business easy. So there's a lot, there was a lot of people that are still very much active in their careers that I have worked with back then. So it was a very, I was very lucky to be able to light up those relationships and knock on, knock and call people up and say, hey, I'm back in the game, what have you got? Let's go. And it was the timing, couldn't have been better, obviously, with that the start of the pandemic and the major shift, the demographic shift that we all saw from the city to the suburbs. Yeah, that really was good timing. I'm sure it wasn't, it was accidentally good for you. Yeah, yeah, yeah. What a fortunate thing. And yet still, there's still a lot of competition, of course, where you are. And there's a lot of great REALTORS. And so, you know, you, I'm assuming you were able to take a lot of the sort of habits and disciplines and that you learned, you know, work and see. Oh, yeah. I mean, I think, you know, being a good salesperson is being a good salesperson. You know, like, you remember the, the wolf of Wall Street. Sure. And that last thing, you know, he had gone to the federal prison for, for, you know, his, his tax evasion and fraud, wire, fraud and all the stuff that he had done. And he got out and then he was giving seminars across the country and holding, he said, sell me the pen. Yeah. Right. And, and that's sort of the, that's the spirit. You know, like when, if you have this skill, it can, it can really work across a lot of different platforms. So, well, I was good at doing it at, and I was, you know, a REALTOR in Manhattan selling co-ops and condos. It, my skills that was very applicable as far as, as selling homes here, here up in the suburbs. It's just, you know, we didn't have, have septic tanks and we didn't worry about that, like, sewage and all that stuff. Roots, there's a whole other aspects of real estate that goes on here that isn't necessarily, I mean, back in the city, you have to worry about co-op or packages, which forget about it. I don't miss those whatsoever. I always loved when my sister bought a condo, or sorry, co-op in the West Village many, many years ago. And my sister's kind of a little superstar in her own, in the industry she's in. And she was certainly more than qualified to buy this co-op. And she, you know, they got the offer accepted. And this is like a million years ago and I didn't know anything about real estate. She's like, oh, and now I have to go for my interview and I was like, your interview. You're my, I was like, what is that? And so if no one's ever dealt with co-ops before you can obviously look this up, but there's typically an interview process to make sure that the, because co-ops are slightly different, it's ownership share. So everyone's kind of owning everything to a degree. So they want to make sure that you're not some total bozo who's going to screw everything up for everyone. And so oftentimes you do have to go in front of the board and forget about, forget about that you put 100% down or whatever. They're not evaluating that. They want to make sure personality wise that you're not a total joke. They want to know who your best friend was in second grade. They want to know your blood type. They want to feel your bank accounts. I mean, they, they want to know every little detail about you. And you, they have a package about that thick in front of you. Did you ever see it? Did you ever have a deal go south because the personalities didn't line up? Did that, oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, it was, I learned that game very quickly. It was my very first, one of my first co-op deals I remember I was dealing with a, the building on the upper east side that was a very snooty, you know, considered themselves quite a and established and, you know, prestigious building. It was a 50% down requirement. You had to put down at least half. And then you had to have at least three times the amount of the apartment in liquid assets. In liquid assets, oh nice. In liquid up, yep, on hand. So I mean, I have like $4 million sitting in cash. Yeah. Yeah. And, and my, I had a client who was like, I'm paying all cash and PSI have $50 million in the bank account. Let's, let's rock and roll. The board came back and said, okay, we'd like to do the interview in July 15th. They, my client said, no, July's no good. What do you have in August? So that was all they needed. That was it. That was the end. Sorry, you're not a fit. We need you to come in July. I just said, yeah, amazing. That was it. They said, if this guy's, if that's how he's going to play it, forget. I mean, you have to, as though you're approaching, you're getting an introduction with the queen. I mean, that's how you have to think of it. Like you have to be so honored. You have to, like if you've got plans and stuff. Kisht the ring. Forget it. We don't care. Let's go. Like, isn't that amazing? Oh, yeah. When they call you, calm. And I learned that very quickly. And you probably have to then prepare your clients for those interviews and say, like, okay, here's, here's some suggestions about like, don't speak in the spoke. You know, whatever, you know, only give the right answer. Don't, you know, whatever, whatever the, you know, the same sort of thing if you're going in for like being deposed by the attorneys, don't say anything that you don't. But it's like happy and ethical and, you know, talk about your golf handicap. And kind of smash earlier that day. And that's about it. So, so moving out to the suburbs, moving away from the co-ops, the condos, more single family homes, and really kind of learning a new inventory, I'm guessing, you know, is going out there and really trying to learn that. Real quickly, though, just curious. I want to go just briefly back to your very first year doing, you know, rentals and maybe some sales in the city. In New York, how do you think or why do you think you did so much better than so many other rookies that year? Was there anything that you can say, you know, I was really good at X, Y, or Z, or I just did things that other people wouldn't do? Just curious on what you thought made the difference for you. Well, for me, it was, I worked as an assistant to one of the top producers in a legend. And I was very lucky to work for this man. His name's Robbie Brown. He is no longer with us. He passed away a couple of years ago, but he is a legend in the industry and an incredible guy. And not at all like a typical broker. Like he was laid back, he rode a bike around the city, he would ride a bike to, you know, to your listing appointments. He was so cool and casual about it. But that was on the exterior. Meantime, he was hustling like nobody's business. You know, he was a great networker. He went to every party. He went to the opening of an envelope, you know, he was there. He mailed the world, you know, he had people working for him that he just grinded. It just sent, you know, postcards out, blanketing the city with mailings, you know, like that old age old adage that we love so much if you throw enough shit on the wall. Some of it's going to stick type thing. I bet this really applies when it comes to this. And the other thing that I learned from him is the value of relationships. He had certain clients that he worked with, that it always goes back to the, you know, it being a referral business, right? So like he had certain people that he worked with, that provided a pretty steady flow of listings. And one of those sources was from estate attorneys. Huge, huge, brilliant. And I thought, you know, when I, so when I went out on my own, I emulated him to the tee. And I, first thing I did was I targeted attorneys. So smart. And I, and it didn't take that, it didn't take too many. You know, I had probably two or three estate attorneys and I have one divorce attorney. Kind of that I really worked on developing those relationships with. I would show up in the office with lunch. I would send, you know, bring donuts in the morning. I went around and drew to myself dropping business cards. Thank hello to everybody in the office. You know, to the point where they started throwing me some listings, you know, smaller ones at first. And then when those would go well, they give me the bigger ones. And that's how I ended up getting that decodal listing was through this estate attorney. Yes. Yeah. So it really is it, you know, if you have, if you think about it, it makes all the sense in the world. If you have a loved one that that died and owns a Manhattan apartment, of course, you're going to go with who your attorney recommends you use. Especially if you're not, if you, you know, if you're the benefactor of the estate, you don't live locally or you just hand it right over. And so I would have to say that that was really the most, that was a critical move that I made that differentiated me from the rest of my pack. Let's call it my incoming class. And it's funny because I've certainly heard of attorneys calling divorce attorneys and of course, estate planning attorneys make all the sense in the world. I don't know why that wouldn't have occurred to me. But I think you might be the first person in all the hundreds of episodes we've done that have mentioned a state planning attorney. So I'm, I'm almost thinking they may be a bigger opportunity in certain ways because a lot of agents maybe do think I should call a divorce attorney and get, and you should do that, of course, should build those relationships. But a state planning attorneys maybe go a little bit, a little bit forgotten. Yeah. Call it over to the radar. But yeah, completely that brilliant. Yeah, that's a thousand percent. That even more seven divorce attorneys, I'd say because you know, divorce is complicated. And typically, especially if there are two people that are two parties that are, have vested interest in that apartment. Usually, you know, somebody knows somebody, they've lived in the town. They've got somebody they want to use. You know, they're less likely to need the referral than an estate attorney. Great point. Because a lot of times when mom and dad pass and the kids now are to deal with all the estate stuff or one of them, it's people are either moving or they're living in different places. Kids live in this Wisconsin. I love that. Yeah, they don't want to know from that. They just, you know, they go to the probate court and go through probate, I should say. And they'll trust their attorneys to handle it for them. And that's a really good spot. If you have a few relationships with some very, you know, some successful attorneys that have quite a few clients or states that they handle it, definitely, that is a huge place for inventory. I could see two people of REALTORS doing webinars or in-person events where it's like, hey, if you haven't done your estate plan, I'm going to bring my estate planning attorney and we'll do a little combo of like, you know, a little presentation. Right, right. I could see that being. Yeah, absolutely. Oh, totally, definitely. That's very much the case. Again, with attorneys, you know, it's, you're not supposed to, you can't technically, you cannot get, they're not entitled to a commission on that. Like you can't say, oh, I'll kick it back to you, you know, but you can, in other ways, you know, try to have them benefit from your business as you are from theirs. And that is one way is bringing them in for something like what you're saying, like a seminar or recommending them to, Sure. I answer your sphere of influence, you know, that's definitely. It's actually even more brilliant in a way that I'm thinking, at least from my perspective, because everybody who owns a home needs a will, right? So it's like every single person you work with could potentially be a referral to, I mean, it depends on what that estate planning attorney, what kind of client they want. But like every single person who owns a home should have some sort of a state plan in place, even if it's just some, you know, easy will that they could do. But it's a really smart because not everyone gets divorced. So it's, it's like, well, somebody's getting divorced. I can certainly refer them to my, to my, the attorney I like, but everybody needs an estate plan. So it's, it's actually, you, Everybody got to do two things. You got to pay taxes and you got to die. Those two things are, are, and we don't know when. Yeah. Yeah. Let's, let's talk about, I want to talk about the state of the market today because you're a huge producer. And the market is, at least I'm in Chicago. We have about 800 agents here at our firm. All I hear about in our agents are great. I'm not here criticizing them at all, but I hear a lot of people being nervous about rate, where rates are with lending, obviously, are higher than, then I mean, they're always too high for anyone really, but they're certainly higher today than they were, you know, two, three years ago. And you know, we're approaching the sevens for, you know, almost 30 year fixes and fixed. And then, and then also inventory being because there's this disincentive to move right now, right? So if like, if I have a 3% mortgage, which I do, you'd have to really make a strong, not you, but, but a REALTOR would have to make a very strong case for me to go, I want to go from 3% to 7%, like that's a tough, tough thing to swallow, tough little swallow. What are you experiencing and how are you coaching some of your clients through this so that they're, so that they're can, it can make sense for them to make these decisions. Well, it's been, it's been tough and that it really is a double whammy because we're just coming off of COVID, you know, the pandemic surge, where a lot of people that were sort of teetering or on the fence about selling, you know, it was in their five year plan, let's say. And then this thing happens that drives the value of their, of their investment up to some 20, 30% and you're like, well, actually, I better cash in. So we had a lot in the last two, three years, we've seen a lot of that where people are, are caching in their chips. So you've got a pause in the, in the action of those, those people that would have been putting their homes on the market, they've already sold. So we've got, we're taking a hit from that side and then we're taking another from the interest rate side because like you said, I mean, people are sitting and join their two, three percent rates, but they're not seeing a dip in prices to incentivize them to, if they wanna, you know, look downsize, get something bigger, if they want, you know, we're just not, it's just not, there's no incentive for them to move unless you're moving to an entirely different area or if you, you know, let's say you're in a certain zip code because of the school system and, you know, you wanna move to a town where, or a different part of the country where the cost of living is much different. It's, or it's really like, it's not a choice, like you got to move because of your job or because of a divorce or a death, it's just, you know, one of those instances. So we're really suffering with the inventory and buyers are frustrated. It's a really tough time. I mean, I can't even imagine, you know, I'm working with buyers right now that are in, you know, and I've got buyers that are in the 5 million plus range and then I've got several buyers that are in like, one to three range. And the one to three range is just forget it. It is so, so much competition. So much competition and they're in there going in, they're putting in offers, they're waving contingencies, you know, mortgage contingency, a pravile contingency inspection contingency, forget it. You know, we'll pay, like we'll pay off cash, we'll close when you want, we'll like, you know, we'll put a statue of your family in the backyard for the rest of the end of time for us to worship at your feet. I mean, you, but you're going against 30 other applicants like there, that you are in a bidding work amongst, you know, there are literally, we're going against 20, 25 different things. So how do you win? I mean, it is so, so tough. So a lot of times like right now, when I'm doing with my buyers, I'm looking at, you know, expired listings. I'm looking at, you know, I'm locking on doors. I'm trying to go off market because once you get involved with all of that craziness, when you are, first two, four weeks to market on the MLS, if you're priced appropriately, it's going to be a madhouse. I mean, if you're overpriced, you're overpriced and that's that you can't do anything about that. But like, if you're, you know, you're listing a mat in the one to three range, it is going to be an absolute zoo and you're competing against the same people over and over and over again, and it's incredibly frustrating. Are there any, any tips you have to stand out in those offers? Any suggestions of, you know, obviously, you don't have a ton of control over all those multiple offers, but just anything that has helped you get a little bit of an edge when you're submitting, you know, an offer that you know is getting a dozen or more other offers. Well, so again, this is where relationships do play a big part because when you start to do a lot of business in a certain market, you get to know all the players, right? So like, if I know the listing broker, I know I've got an advantage because I can talk, or even better yet, if I've done a deal with that listing broker and we know each other, we can trust each other, then I know that I can go, I can talk with that listing broker more frankly and get more information for my client than some, than an unknown. So that's where experience really is crucial. Like you want to work with someone who's been around the block a few times to, because knowing the landscape, knowing the players really makes a huge difference because if it's between you and your client or, you know, Joe Schmo that from some firm you've never heard of, with the exact same offer, you're gonna win. Yeah. Right, you're gonna get it. So I would say that does play a part for sure. The other thing I recommend doing is, you know, the family resume always helps like that cheesy kind of, like we love your house and we- Like the love letter, yeah. Right, and the photos with the family and like, you know, because people, you know, homes are very, they're very sentimental meaningful things to people who've raised a family in a home and spent decades of their life caring for this home. They really want to make sure that that home goes to somebody who's going to do the same thing, you know. That's just, it's almost like, there is such a powerful emotional connection to a home that you've lived in and raised your family in. And you really, you don't want to sell that home until like a developer, you know, or some investor, like somebody representing like a, some guy in, you know, and some Russian oligarch or something, sorry. You know, like if you're a nice, nice, if you're a nice people that have, you know, like you wanna, you like the school system, you're a nice family, you absolutely wanna present that to the sellers. And there is, you can get an edge. I mean, I just, we just experienced this recently with a deal that I'm doing at the moment in Bedford, New York and Westchester County. It was between my people and, and, or it was gonna go to this developer who actually had put in a higher offer than we did. But this is, you know, they're young couple, they wanna raise a family in this home. They love so, this is another thing that's, this is a tip that people love getting compliments on the work that they've done or the upgrades that they've done on the home. So, you know, knowing like this was in 1930, just almost, it's a gorgeous home. But they did so much work to it, upgrading it, decorating it and painting and the moldings and the chandelier and they did all the fireplaces over. They really did a wonderful job. So, we wanted to just throw, we wanted to tell them what a brilliant job that they had done, how much we loved the, the materials that they used in their kitchen. And we love the kitchen island that granite. It's like, you know, get detailed. People love that stuff. They love like painting. They, you know, why do we do anything, right? Like why do we renovate our kitchens and bathrooms and put all this stuff on the wall? Cause we want people our guests to come in and say, ooh, wow, great. I'm like, that's why we do it, right? So like to get that recognition to get that kind of, like that's going to get, that's going to work in your favor. People do appreciate that. What percentage, what would you guess? Cause you are up against multiple offers, of course, in the price ranges you're at. And, you know, you're coming in with some of the more human parts of it that like, ooh, we really love what you did with the kitchen, the blah, blah. You know, and you can talk about that or even maybe the buying couple can record a little video or type out a letter or, you know, hey, oh my God, it's so amazing. What percentage of offers do you think do that? Is it, it's, I know it was more popular during the pandemic when there were so many offers where it was like you had to do something to stand out, but now that that's subsided, but inventory is still low and there's a lot of multiple offers now. Is that a common thing or is that just something that like, I imagine most REALTORS don't do that. They just put in the offer, see what happens. Yeah, I guess it depends, you know, on the deal. It depends on, you know, like, for example, if I'm representing one of those estates from the, you know, referral from a state attorney, like those kids in Wisconsin, they just want, they want to divvy up the mud, they got it split up for a ways they don't care. Or something, you know, it doesn't work all of it, but that's not all the time. I guess it's it, I would apply it as needed. It's a situational kind of a vibe, vibe out. You gotta suck it out and see when it's appropriate and when it's appropriate. And of course, like if it's appropriate for your client too, because maybe you're not representing a really nice family, like maybe you are representing, you know, an investor or somebody that wants to put a sub-divided or do all or gut it or who knows. So it really, it's that sort of a, yeah, apply as needed as what, as how I would phrase that. And that's something that a good broker can vibe out. And especially if you are, if you've worked without listing broker before, you know, that's in the due diligence information gathering stage, a good broker should be able to guide you through that. Yeah, no, for sure. I love that tip is if we think that the sellers have an emotional attachment to the upgrades they've made, that can be something that the agent can ask the other agent, hey, my client really loves what you guys did with the kitchen. And then they can, you know, can figure out how much you want to press that in the offer. But certainly people are always loved to be complimented on their work. So that is, you know, even even if it doesn't win the, win the bid, it certainly is a, is a good practice to compliment people on what they've done right with their house. Because also if they're like most of us, I think most of us, like we look in the mirror and we see the little imperfections in ourselves. And I think most people think about that way with their home as well. It's like, yeah, I did this project, but then there's like 10 other projects I had didn't get to. So most people look at their home and they're like, Oh, God, I have so many things I have to do and I haven't done. And then when somebody comes in and it's like, Oh, that thing you did is really cool. It's like, Oh, yeah, that's right. I did do that thing. And that's really it's a nice little reminder. Yeah. I mean, your home is yet an extension of yourself. And it's a representation of yourself. Absolutely. And just like you said, we look, we, when we're living in it, we don't see how that we look and see the flaws. And we think everyone's going to comment and say like, that is like the wall color sheep. Like that, you know, I remember when I first got my first apartment on the Upper West side and I stained the floors really dark. You know, so I was like this prewar apartment and like the walls were this really high ceiling with like these moldings beautiful, like a classic six apartment on the Upper West side. And I stained them like I just went for it. I stand in like a bany color, you know, so really shiny and kind of contrasted the white walls and everything. But of course, I was like, Oh, God, is it like so? Is it too dark? Like did I put the right shade? And I remember like walking, I would, I would walk in to get my first impression of the place and then walk back out and then walk back in to like get a fresh. Like I must have, I probably did that 20 times. And you know, my husband at the time was probably like, Oh my God, she's, she's totally gone. Deserk, but it was that first brand that came over. I remember her name's Eve. We went to college together. She came over and she said, I love your floors. And then you never had to think about it again. And it was like, Oh my God, God bless. Like, yeah, it's just, yeah, you need affirmation. We all, we all love and need affirmation. Well, I have, I have an all white condo. Everything's white or in like white and black, the fixtures are black, you know, but like the counter tops the floor is light. All the walls are white. And I can't wait for like 10 years from now, somebody will walk in and go, what were they thinking? Because everything changes, you know, at some point, like the all white thing will just not be cool anymore. And everything is going to look goofy at some point in history. So it's funny. So, you know, I just, I'm looking forward to that kind of, because I remember when I bought my condo before in 2005 and we were doing certain things with granite and that was real popular. And now it's like, we look at those goofy granite, some of the goofy or granite colors were like, what were they thinking? It's like, no, that was in back in 2005. And now, you know, the white thing has kind of been in for the last five years. And it's probably on its way out. And it was like, it's up. We reached floors that was not how to ride. I was like, you know, those like leech wood and nan tuckety kind of shingles and that like everything's just like been in the sun for too long kind of. It is, it is funny, but it is, it's important. I think agents sometimes forget that that like there are real, if you're representing buyers, there's real human beings on the stellar side. And if you have a good relationship with that, with the listing agent. And that's where it's really important to play nice in the sandbox, right? It's like always. And look, I know, especially I think women get, I mean, I don't want to generalize based on gender, but I think women get this much worse than men is that there's just a lot of jerks that are REALTORS in the industry too. And I know a lot of women who are very successful in real estate who are like, you would not believe the way I get spoken to by other REALTORS on a regular basis. Like nice, nice, you see, you're not in your head. And it's like, well, who could ever be mean to Sarah? She's like a lovely sweet person. Oh, she has to deal with this too. And the reality of it is, it only is ultimately going to hurt the other agent if they're a jerk to you because you're not going to forget that. Yeah. I mean, especially like the whole like listing broker buying broker dynamic. Like if you're the listing broker, you are like too cool for school. Like you are, you know, you should be grateful if you get a return phone call from the listing broker. Like it's just that's the market that we're in right now. It's a seller's market, right? So like if you want to be on the sell side and like we're all the buyer side, we're all sweating away. Like please, can we show it? Oh, you'll let us like you just have to be so nice and, you know, catch more flies with honey type thing. And the listing broker stuff, it's like, like can we just lose the attitude? You know, like I, it's just like pleat. I don't understand it. You know, like it's one of those like, you know, when there's like an event for a cocktail for brokers or network event for brokers and people are like, why am I going to go to that? I don't want to meet a bunch of brokers. Like I'm not selling a broker's. And it's like, uh, no, you go to those, you go to all those cocktail parties. You, you meet everybody, you handshake, you throw cards up because you never know when that relationship is going to be important. And the thing your network, you know, the more that that business is going, it's going to inevitably build. If you put it out there, it's going to build. Yes. And you, you could not be more, more accurate there. And I've just heard that said over the years on the show by just about every person we've ever had on is, is be really, really nice to other agents. And also realize that other agents might be having a bad day too and give them a bit of grace when they falter and maybe are less than professional, even though that's never acceptable to be less than professional, but it happens. And it's one of those things where, um, you know, the, the top agents I know, kind of learn how to grin and bear it a little bit more. It's not quite as personal to them when somebody's awful to them. And obviously that sucks. Where to ever have somebody be awful to anybody. But this idea of like, I'm just going to catalog that. I'm going to remember that. And, you know, maybe in the future, that maybe won't serve that person that was crappy to me. Maybe, maybe, maybe, oh, but I, you know, and, and we all want to. Karma happen. It's a car. McWorthen function. It happens. And especially, you know, in a market like Grunitsch, where, you know, it's a, it's a big market, but there are a few very strong players that you'll, you'll see again and again. And, um, and, you know, and that, the beauty of our business too is like, a deal has a beginning and an end, right? Like you can tolerate anybody for it through the, the length of time that it takes to, to sign a contract and get to a closing. It's not like you're going to have to go to a nine to five job and see this person every day for the rest of your life, you know, like, they, when the deal is done, the deal is done. And that's what I love. I love like the sense of, of completion, the, of achievement of, of finale, you know, it's over. So you can move on to the next one, but you just need to make it through. That can make it keep everybody happy so we get to the finish line. I, I agree. I think that is, that makes all the sense in the world. Um, one thing I wanted to mention because I know we're, we're kind of running coming up on near the end of our, our time. I was, um, thinking about, um, your, you know, what you're, oh, I, I know I wanted to ask you, it was about what you do in between your deals. So you just talked about like there's a beginning and an end to the relationship. You know, some, some clients are easier to work with than others. Some you're like, I can't wait to be the, this person's friend forever. And others are like, you know, um, that was a nice experience. And we don't need to, you know, keep, keep, you know, keep, keep, uh, communicating. But what do you do in between those transactions so that the clients don't forget about you, right? Like, obviously you can't be friends with everybody. Um, but are you doing, because you know, if somebody's only really utilizing you every, let's say five to seven years or whatever the cycle is in your area, um, what are you doing so that they don't forget? Oh, who did we use five years ago? Not that you're forgettable. You are not forgettable. But let's assume that we're all forgettable. You know, we're all, we're all forgettable. Um, and, and so, you know, we, what, what are you doing to make sure your clients don't forget you? I mean, you got to do all the stuff to stay top of mind, right? Like we all know the stuff. It's just there. It's, it's a, it's not, this is the gritty pan in the ass stuff that we all, it's all like we're not looking forward to it. We don't love coming up in your inbox all the time and being so annoying and videos, not, you know, like being in your face type thing. But it really, it, it matters. It's important. Like you have to stay top of mind. And that means we continuously marketing yourself, reaching out, you know, to, to your network. Um, blasting out those emails, sending postcards, social media, obviously, is incredibly important. And I always say it's more, it's more like if, if it's not like you're, I personally don't get my, my phone's not ringing off the hook from my social media. You know, it's not like someone's looking at a TikTok that I made and like, oh my god, Sarah, like it's you. You are the one you have to sell our, but it, what it does provide is like, it's a, um, when they go to do some due diligence on you and they go to check you out, a would be client, they're, they're going to see all that stuff. And they're going to feel nice and safe and snugly found that they're in good hands with, with you. Like, so that stuff all really, it accumulates. It makes you, as the time goes on and you've got more, more history, it's, it's all the better. So you really just, you can't be afraid to put yourself out there. And I know that that's so, it's not easy to do. It's, it's like, it's really, it, you got to take the good, but the bad, when it comes to that stuff, but you really, it's in this day and age, and it's crucial to not only maintaining your business, but really growing your business. You, you need to stay, uh, relevant to the conversation. It also gives people access, right? Like it allows people to feel like they have a connection with you, even at three in the morning, when you're asleep, if they're awake, scrolling through Instagram or wherever and they're now seeing like, Oh, oh, that's a, maybe I know Sarah or maybe I don't. Maybe I'm being introduced to her through a TikTok or whatever, but it allows people access to you more about you without you having to make pick up the phone and, and you know, call, make these cold calls, which you've done, you've done cold walking, you've done a lot of these more difficult, um, you know, sort of cold introductions, whereas, you know, social media is a great way for people just to remember, might be reminded of what you do, right? So it's like, you can continually pump out content about all this cool stuff you're doing in real estate in, in sort of the thought that like the right people will see it. My followers might see it, that at least be reminded I'm still in the game and doing x, y and z for, for as a REALTOR. Um, so I, I think for it's, it's a lot of just a branding thing, right? It's like, it's not, it's more than that. But I think from a branding perspective, it's, you know, we know most people scroll, uh, you know, scroll in, in some sort of social media channel, uh, once or twice during the day, might as well be one of the things they come across, right? Exactly. And I mean, if you're not doing it, somebody else is doing it. I can guarantee you that. And like, and the more that we are in, in an online business, you know, I mean, I think Zilla was a real game changer in, in the way that we, um, we have the availability of, of understanding your market and, and knowing what's on the market. Um, we didn't have this pretty 2000. I mean, the, the client had to slowly rely on the REALTOR to show you what was available on the market at that time. So now, they have access to pretty much almost every platform that you do. So how are you going to add value to that, for example, you know, how, how are you going to enhance that experience for them or provide, provide them an experience buying or selling a home that, and a, a different agent can't, you know, yeah. So that's really, you got to find exactly that your brand, your vision. What's really cool is you get to lean into that now. Whatever your thing is, like, could be outside of real estate even, maybe you're passionate about something a hobby or, you know, particular belief system or group or whatever. You're just into X. And what's really cool as an agent with social media, one of the good parts of social media is you get to not only find all the other people that are into X, but even if you don't have a community of people that are into the same thing you are, you can start posting about that on your real estate page. If you're really into something, maybe it tangentially relates to real estate or maybe it doesn't, but if you're into surfing or whatever you might be into, you know, you can do that. And then people start to feel like, oh, that's pretty cool. This is what this versus it to. And you'll, and you can start attracting, you know, surfers or a people who are in that space, simply by posting a lot of good quality content that a surfer might want or that somebody that's across that or whatever it might be. Right. And you get to be yourself, which is really cool. Blow up an entire different demographic that you wouldn't have had access to. And that's like this job, you're always working, even when you're socializing and just generally having fun, you know, like you're actually, you're working. You're always, you're meeting people, you're interacting with people. It's an opportunity to let that person know who you are and what you do, you know, so that's why it's so important to, I mean, obviously working your career is important. But when I'm, you know, playing tennis or I'm playing pickle ball, or even if I'm going to, you know, an event, a fancy granite, a gala or something like that, that's always an opportunity to connect with somebody and to grow your business. So like, it's a kind of a cool way to not feel guilty sometimes, like sometimes when, you know, you're doing something that's not work, work, work, work, you're like, but really when I'm, I mean, I've gotten a lot of business from playing tennis because we women love to chat when we're playing a double match, like we're on the on the changeover. And like, who doesn't love to talk about real estate? You know, like, everyone's got to live somewhere. Right. And like, it's such, it's so easy to casually be like, Oh my God, you guys, this showing that I had earlier today, let me tell you. And they'll lean right in the, the, they want to know. And my goal is always to make sure not don't ever leave any social situation without them knowing that I'm a REALTOR. Like that's all I have to do. That's all you have to do. I don't, I don't need to push it down there. I don't want to ram it down their throat and ask them where they live. And are they interested in selling in the next five years? You know, all I need to do is have them register that somewhere in their peripheral that, Oh, I played tennis with this lady and she's a real estate broker. And you just don't know how that's going to Germany, you know, and it might, and it might be that like that person's brother is a REALTOR. And so you're not going to get that business, but they might say, Oh, my friend, you need to talk to my friend, she would be awesome because, you know, so yeah, you're right, you never know where it's going to germinate. I love what you just said, every, your job is as a marketer part of being a REALTOR is to make sure that everybody who you come across that you interact with understands what you do for a living. It does, right, pushing is always, to me, I'm not a big fan of people. But I want to know, I want to know what all of my friends do. I want to know where they work. Like I haven't, I've an interest in that when I meet somebody, you know, oftentimes what they do for a living might be the least interesting thing. But I still ask and I still am like, Oh, what are you into? What do you do? That's really, really important. We shouldn't be, again, it and also everyone's got to live somewhere. So they're going to need a REALTOR anyway. So you might as well, it's not like you're trying to sell them aluminum siding or something that they may or may not need or want. Right? You're not selling something that's not important. You're actually like, well, you're going to use a REALTOR anyway. So it's a good idea to make sure that people know that that's what I do. So I want to end with that because I think that is such an important, create an important thing. For everyone listening, let's make it a goal that everybody in your life this year is going to get some sort of reach out from you in a gentle way to remind them that you are in the business and you can figure out the best way to do that. Everyone's got their own individual style. Make sure that everybody in your end that you're consistently dripping something on them. Maybe not every week, maybe not every even month, but a few times a year at a minimum, they're getting some sort of reminder that you are a REALTOR. So Sarah, thank you so much. And I also want to say for everyone before, before leaving, don't leave you shut because I would like to remind everyone that Sarah is always, as we talked about having relationships with other REALTORS, Sarah gets a lot of her business from referrals because she's just that good. So if you have any clients that are moving in and out of Connecticut, even parts of New York, it doesn't even matter where. Just reach out to Sarah. She can't help you. She'll know who to refer to, but she would love to connect with you specifically around Connecticut, parts of New York as well. So we're talking Fairfield County, Greenwich Westport Westchester County, Westchester County, right up to the city. Those are my wheelhouses and I love referrals. I think you'll, you would, I never chance me with referral fees. And Sarah's clients oftentimes have other homes elsewhere or move. So if you are in an area that people may be retired to, you know, or Florida, Florida is the big one. Yeah. So let's, let's, you know, this, this is a two way street sort of scenario. So definitely reach out to Sarah. Also, if you're a REALTOR in Connecticut and you're like, God, I would love to work with someone like Sarah. I would love for her to be on, to be on her team and learn from her. She learned from one of the best. You can learn from her. She's one of the best now. So, you know, reap now, obviously, she's, they can't take everyone. But if you think you could add value to her team or if you think, you know, she could add value to your business, reach out to her. This is, well, let's, let's build a relationship. So Sarah, if there is another REALTOR who wants to connect with you either for referral or maybe they're interested in looking at Douglas element or your team, what's the best way they should reach out to you? Well, they can always, they can find me on my Insta, which is at Sarah Stone style. And if not that, you know, my, my cell phone, my, my email, which I don't know if you can provide that in the notes. Sure. But yeah, always reach out. My website is element.com slash Sarah stone.
