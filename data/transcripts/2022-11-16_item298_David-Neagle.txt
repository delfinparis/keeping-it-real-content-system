[00:05:13] David. Welcome to the show. Thanks for having me, it's an honor to be here. Well, it's an honor to
[00:05:18] have you. I am always interested. I've always been fascinated by consultants because I just love
[00:05:25] essentially they're problem solvers and this idea of real estate agents are so often their own
[00:05:32] CEO, their own customer service team, a lot of times so many of our listeners, it's just them,
[00:05:38] and they're running the entire company. They have to wear every single hat and this idea of
[00:05:43] getting a coaching experience or having some third party person come in and say, hey,
[00:05:50] here's some tweaks that you may want to consider. It's very, very exciting and most of our listeners
[00:05:55] just don't have that, so I'm excited to get some insight into you about maybe ways they could
[00:06:00] improve their mindset or part of their behavior to help actually get them more results, but without
[00:06:08] just working more hours, I know that's a huge one of your tenences. There's ways to become more
[00:06:13] productive without just pushing and grinding it out more, but before we get to all that, I want to
[00:06:18] hear more about you and your story. Can you tell us a little bit about your journey in the business
[00:06:23] world and how you ended up in consulting? Yeah, it's an interesting journey. It's a very interesting
[00:06:28] journey. As we were talking about off-air, I was born and raised in Chicago and from about 13 on,
[00:06:39] my life was kind of taking a bit of a different twist because my parents got divorced and we were
[00:06:44] kind of just left alone, me and my brother, to really kind of bring ourselves up. There was not
[00:06:49] a lot of engagement or near as much as there should have been. So I was making a lot of mistakes,
[00:06:57] and I never liked school as a kid. I didn't like to read. I have a library that's over 4,000 books
[00:07:04] that I've read them all. So it's a really weird twist, but at 17 years old, I quit high school.
[00:07:10] I went into the army, got out of the army, came home, got married, but I had no skills.
[00:07:16] I guarded nuclear bases in the army in Germany. So I didn't really have anything that transferred
[00:07:24] over into a skill. I got my GED in the army, but I had no other formal education. So I just went to
[00:07:32] work, got married, we had a couple of kids, and I found out really quickly that I was creating more
[00:07:39] responsibility that I had the ability to actually stand up and handle. I didn't have the skill sets
[00:07:43] to be able to provide financially for my family, but I didn't know what to do to change it.
[00:07:49] And the other thing was that I was around, the people that I was around, I would ask for help.
[00:07:55] Like, can you give me some advice as to what to do? And all they would say to me is you should
[00:07:59] not quit high school. It's like, yeah, how do you get that now? I realized the error, okay,
[00:08:05] but I can't go back and change that. So what do I do now? But they really couldn't give me any
[00:08:10] advice. They would just say work harder, work all the overtime that you can. In the late 80s, I had a
[00:08:15] brief stint working for metropolitan life insurance company selling insurance, which was actually going
[00:08:21] well until the savings and loan crisis hit. And then my policies were dropped. Like people were
[00:08:27] dropping policies left and right, right? They just couldn't afford them. So my paycheck went down
[00:08:32] so low that I couldn't stay working there. And the only other thing I could do was drive a truck or
[00:08:37] drive a forklift. So I went to work for a warehouse in Lyle, Illinois, Keehee Foods. And at the time,
[00:08:46] Mr. Keehee was the largest food importer in the country. And most of the things that we get
[00:08:51] and appreciate are because he brought those things in and really supplied, especially really heavily
[00:08:57] supplied them to the Midwest area of the country. So I was working there, but I wasn't doing well.
[00:09:03] I hated what I did. I didn't like it. I didn't see any future for myself. I felt extremely stuck
[00:09:08] and things are progressively getting worse. So I wake up one morning and our cars repossessed, right?
[00:09:17] And we end up filing for bankruptcy. We have to leave our apartment in the middle of the night
[00:09:21] because we can no longer afford to live there. So we have to move to a really bad neighborhood
[00:09:26] way down south by Joliet and I have to work, have to drive in to Lyle to go to work. So it's
[00:09:33] things are getting really bad. And I was more and more humiliated by the day where we were living,
[00:09:44] where we were bringing our kids up. The stories that I was hearing about was happening there
[00:09:48] during the day while I was at work. Sure. And I got to work one day and I got reprimanded twice
[00:09:55] before I even punched it. So I was already in the worst possible mood. I was tired. I was exhausted.
[00:10:01] I was working six and a half days a week. And I was in this trailer. I was loading food into this
[00:10:06] trailer and I broke down and just started crying. And I was like, God, please show me something. Anything
[00:10:10] how to get out of this. I don't know how to turn this around. Because my thought was I have to go
[00:10:15] to college, but I need time and money to do that. This is before the internet. I mean, there was no,
[00:10:20] you had to go to a physical building. You had to, you know, spend time to go get an education.
[00:10:26] And it was not a possibility at that time in my life. So I had this voice in my head said,
[00:10:31] change your attitude that night. Like it was very, it was like very loud in my head. It said,
[00:10:37] change your attitude. And I started playing with that idea and really long story short. I changed
[00:10:43] three things in my attitude. And I said, I am really going to see if there's anything to this.
[00:10:48] Like it can this work because it wasn't that I hadn't heard that before. That's a teacher who
[00:10:53] used to tell my parents when I was a kid. You know, like, Dave's a pretty smart guy. If he would change
[00:10:58] his attitude about school, he would do well. But I hated school. I just couldn't stand it.
[00:11:02] He just hated being there. So I started acting like I loved what I did. I started treating people
[00:11:08] with respect because actually what it wasn't that I was the mean person. I was angry and didn't
[00:11:13] know what to do with that anger. So I was taking it out disrespectfully to other people. And I really
[00:11:18] wasn't doing the best job that I could because nobody ever showed me how to do that. So I was working
[00:11:23] to go home. I was raised in a in a in a union environment, so to speak in in Chicago. And it was
[00:11:31] only about doing what you're paid for. Wasn't there was no attitude about really trying to work
[00:11:36] your way to the top doing more than you're paid for, right? That kind of a of an ideal. I did not
[00:11:42] have that. So in I changed this and make this change. I'm like, I'm going to do this for a year
[00:11:48] and see if it if anything changes in my life because I didn't know what else to do. In 30 days,
[00:11:54] I tripled my income. Wow. Yeah. Well, I was right. How did that happen? How did that happen?
[00:12:00] In a year, well, I'm 20,000 a year to 62,000 in 30 days. And it's so spun my head around
[00:12:08] that I thought to myself, how can this possibly be? How can I how can I make this change and have
[00:12:15] this happen in in 30 days? And what what became very interesting to observe was that the opportunity
[00:12:26] to do that had been around me for two years, but I didn't see it as an opportunity because I was
[00:12:31] looking through a lens of being angry and blaming and victimized everywhere that I went.
[00:12:39] And what happened was there was this guy that used to come to our dock at Kiihi Foods twice a
[00:12:45] week, every Tuesday and every Thursday. And he drove a fuel truck out of Lamont, okay? A company
[00:12:51] called Asco Fuel, okay? They did a big red truck. She probably seen them downtown. Yeah. Right?
[00:12:57] So he would come, he would come every Tuesday, every Thursday and he filled our trucks with fuel.
[00:13:03] And he also filled the trailers because they were refrigerated trailers. So they had to fill them
[00:13:07] with diesel fuel. Part of my job was to make sure that he filled the right ones, the ones that we
[00:13:11] loaded with food. Check his ticket off and then, you know, let's send him on his way. But the guy
[00:13:17] always wreaked a diesel fuel like he really stuck. He had to be outside working, whether it was like
[00:13:24] a hundred degrees in mosquitoes and humans that gets in Chicago or if it was 20 below out there or
[00:13:30] if it was pouring rain, he was always out in the element. And I used to think to myself, at least I'm
[00:13:36] underneath this dock, you know, I got this dock over my head like this is some big. This guy's got
[00:13:40] a real bad. Yeah, exactly. And I get to know this guy over two years. His name was Drew Batti. He
[00:13:53] said, I think this change, he comes up to me one day and he says, how long are you going to stay
[00:13:59] here? Is he new that I wanted to get out that I was looking for something else? And I'm like, Drew,
[00:14:04] I don't know, you know, I have, I have absolutely no idea. Like I would so do something if I only
[00:14:08] knew what to do. And he said, why don't you come to work with me like come to work,
[00:14:13] run work. And I'm like, and I started ripping on the guy, right? I started in front of him. And
[00:14:19] I'm like, dude, you drive a bomb on wheels. You deliver fuel. Like I don't want to do that. I said,
[00:14:24] I actually said this, said this to him. I'm like, is anybody ever died? Drive me one. That's a
[00:14:29] reasonable question. I thought so. And he says to me, yes, last year, a guy, a guy going down 65,
[00:14:38] and he driving down the Indiana flips it and he burns to death. And I'm like, say what I mean,
[00:14:42] I don't want to come work for. I don't want to work with you. And I made this, I made the real
[00:14:47] insulting comment to him. I said, besides all of that, I said, how much could you possibly be
[00:14:53] making? Well, last year, I made 50,000. Wow. And I went, what? And like get out of here. You
[00:15:01] didn't make no 50,000 driving that thing. I don't know what I was thinking. Like I don't know what I
[00:15:07] was comparing it to in my mind, but it was pure ignorance on my part. Sure. And he says, I will
[00:15:12] bring you my check stuff next week when I come in. I'll show you. You don't believe me. I'm like,
[00:15:18] yeah, you do that, right? Next week he comes and he shows me and he had made a little over 50,000.
[00:15:24] And I'm like, you're kidding me. So all of a sudden, I'm now looking at this, like, maybe this
[00:15:30] is an opportunity. Pay attention here. I had a ton of questions. I had to get over all kinds of
[00:15:35] personal fear about what this was. Sure. Long story short, though, I went, I went there within a
[00:15:41] week. I got hired. I started working in my income triple instantly. Amazing. And the thing was this,
[00:15:49] because this could have been a story where I went to work there. I acted like I got lucky.
[00:15:56] I worked really hard in either state of truck driver there for the rest of my life because
[00:16:00] there were guys that did that. They're like their whole career drive in those fuel trucks.
[00:16:04] Or maybe I could have gotten into management. It was a small family on company. So that was kind of
[00:16:09] rare. But I didn't look at it as luck. I didn't believe in luck. I thought to myself, I did something
[00:16:17] that caused this. I just don't know what it is. And what, so I started, I pulled out a copy of
[00:16:24] Think and Grow Rich that I had when I worked for Metropolitan life. And in the introduction,
[00:16:31] there's a, there's a thing called the Slime Disguises of Opportunity. And Hill says that most people
[00:16:38] miss opportunity because they don't see it as opportunity. They see it as being unfortunate or
[00:16:44] misfortune or temporary defeat. They don't actually see the opportunity that's in front of them.
[00:16:49] And when I read that, I thought to myself, that's what this is. That's why I didn't see this for two
[00:16:54] years because I was looking at it as something that it's not. I got so fascinated by that idea. I'm
[00:17:00] like I got to learn more. So I started reading everything I could get my hands on. I started going
[00:17:05] to seminars. I went to like Tony Robbins in like 1993 and everybody's like, RAH-RAH. I thought it
[00:17:11] was like, this is the coolest thing in the world. I didn't even know this world existed. And I was
[00:17:16] on this path for about seven years. And I started working with people because everybody saw my life
[00:17:22] changing. It just kept getting better and better and better. I started out at this company driving
[00:17:25] a truck when I left. I was in charge of expanding the company across the country. And I never went
[00:17:30] to school. I just kept learning on the job and playing myself the best that I could. And people
[00:17:36] would say to me, can I fix my business? Do you have any idea what I could do different? And I would
[00:17:42] give them advice and they would do it and they would start winning. And I'm like, this is a business.
[00:17:48] It's actually this month on 1999, October of 1999 is when I started the business 24 years ago.
[00:17:57] And I started it. I walked away from what I was doing and I never went back. And it's been a
[00:18:02] journey of a lifetime. It's just been unbelievable. Well, you have, first of all, congratulations on
[00:18:08] 24 years in the consulting business. And also thank you for your service as well. I know that you
[00:18:15] said that earlier in the story, but something that that, you know, I think is important to
[00:18:20] for us that are not in military service to realize that sometimes, you know, soldiers or people that
[00:18:28] you know are in the military, whether they're soldiers or not, are coming home. They're finishing
[00:18:32] up their commitment. And maybe they don't, I mean, I'm sure there's more opportunities now for
[00:18:37] them to develop skills than then existed when you when you were there. But some people come back and
[00:18:41] they don't know what to do and they don't have those skills. So it's important. Remember that.
[00:18:45] Yeah. And they're mess. Yeah. So, you know, here, I was interviewing a Lieutenant Curl at my own
[00:18:52] podcast a couple of weeks ago and he told me he said, you know, we lost about 7,000 men and women
[00:18:57] in the Afghan war. He said, but we've lost over 30,000 due to suicide since they've come back.
[00:19:03] And he was telling me just, you know, the PTSD, the mental illness is horrific and we're not
[00:19:15] yes. And obviously there is. So if any of us know veterans and people that come back like, let's
[00:19:21] let's put on our empathy and compassion hats and let's figure out how what we can do to help serve
[00:19:26] them as they served us. But I also wanted to to mention you, as you were talking about your own
[00:19:32] journey, I was thinking about it's probably the name of a book. It certainly isn't a phrase I made up,
[00:19:38] although I'd love to say that I did. But it sounded like a lot of it was this gift of desperation,
[00:19:43] right? You had responsibilities. You know, if you were had been a single guy and, you know, early
[00:19:49] on in life where you sort of like, yeah, I have a crappy job. I'm not, you know, I don't see a lot
[00:19:53] of room for improvement, but it's only me. I'm only so dealing with my own self that maybe isn't
[00:19:59] for some people as painful as, oh, I have, you know, a family to support. I have, you know,
[00:20:04] trying to figure out I have bills to pay. I have all these responsibilities and I'm stuck. And I
[00:20:09] think a lot of even our listeners who who get in get their real estate license probably a big chunk
[00:20:16] of the reason why is they want freedom. They want the freedom to work when they'd like to. They want
[00:20:20] the ability to be their own boss. Of course, nobody tells them like that's a lot to do. And it's not
[00:20:26] the easiest thing to figure out on your own, which is why coaching exists and consultants. And
[00:20:33] but it's a really hard thing for an individual practitioner to figure out. But I love the fact that
[00:20:40] as you sort of, you know, progress through your career, even though you were in what, you know,
[00:20:46] admittedly lower level or lower skilled jobs, you said your idea was, well, if I change my attitude,
[00:20:53] let's just let's just test this out and see, is there an empirical result? Is there, you know,
[00:21:00] is my life actually going to look differently? And it tripled your salary because you did identify
[00:21:06] an opportunity that at first glance was not an opportunity. It was like, oh, that would be a
[00:21:11] demotion. If I were to come work for you, I might, I might, you know, have injury or die. And also,
[00:21:18] there's way you make it any money or you're the guy filling our trucks. And sure enough, no,
[00:21:23] there was because, you know, that person was was kind enough to to look past some of the
[00:21:29] Joaquin salts and go, actually, I do pretty well. And you should come work with me. And you were
[00:21:35] smart enough or maybe desperate enough or whatever that part is to be able to go, oh, okay,
[00:21:42] this is a real thing. And then take action. And I think you're right. It's like mindset really
[00:21:47] allows people like you were saying in the Napoleon Hill book, you know, to some of some of,
[00:21:51] some of these opportunities that come to us don't seem like opportunities. They almost might even
[00:21:56] seem like problems. And this idea of keeping your mind open enough to see a different path
[00:22:04] is exactly what you did. And then when you went to work for this, this smaller company, which you
[00:22:08] said, really didn't have a lot of obvious opportunity because it's a family run business.
[00:22:13] They're going to be promoting probably from within. I don't know if I'm even going to progress.
[00:22:18] But the one thing that I'm sorry to keep going on and on, but I just wanted to you reminded me
[00:22:23] of something that I think is so important, which is which I wish, in my parents did a wonderful
[00:22:29] job raising me. But one thing I wish it would have been drilled into me a little bit more was that
[00:22:33] even I was like a dishwasher when I was a teenager and I had those super low skill level jobs.
[00:22:39] And it's really hard work is working in a warehouse is crazy hard. I did construction. I did a
[00:22:45] lot of those kind of tasks. And every boss at any of those companies, whether it's a small
[00:22:51] family firm or a large, they really are just looking for somebody to shine in whatever position it is.
[00:22:56] And like the boss goes, Oh, thank God, this person cares. And we're going to keep our eye on this
[00:23:01] person. And opportunities do become available not every time, but but in a lot of instances.
[00:23:06] Or if the company you're at doesn't recognize how well you're doing other people will. And
[00:23:12] and they'll might extend opportunities to you. So I love that story. Okay, so thank you for that.
[00:23:19] And I really was just really taken in by by your journey. And it's really obviously very inspiring.
[00:23:26] So as you I know you you know work with with a lot of different businesses and also with real estate
[00:23:32] agents, I want to talk about mindset because you're really talked about you know changing attitude,
[00:23:37] you know whether we call it attitude mindset. Love to hear sort of what your thoughts are on how
[00:23:44] somebody could actually start to to to identify maybe mindset challenges that they're experiencing
[00:23:50] and then what they can do about it. Let me tell you about a couple of interesting things that
[00:23:54] happened to me with real estate people along my journey. Very early on, one of the first that I can
[00:24:01] remember real estate people that I that that hired me was a guy who was doing land deals, right.
[00:24:09] And he was pretty successful here in the States doing land deals and then the Chinese started to
[00:24:15] come in and they were buying up enormous plots of land. These were $100 million deals. And where
[00:24:23] he was succeeding before he was completely failing. So I don't remember how he got introduced to me.
[00:24:28] And I had never really done anything with real estate before but I had a conversation with
[00:24:33] him and he hired me and I said well tell me what's going on. He was like I can't figure it out like
[00:24:38] I'm succeeding over here. He says but every every one of these huge deals that I try to close with
[00:24:43] the Chinese it's like it's just going out the window. Well when here's something that's interesting
[00:24:48] I had some experience working with some Chinese companies and they do business different.
[00:24:55] You know there are number one they're very meticulous about the bottom line and all the different
[00:25:03] pieces of a contract that may not be important to us here but they're very important it's very
[00:25:09] important to them. So anyway so he's telling me the story and I said well where are you losing the
[00:25:15] deal. And he's like it's at the contract. We're losing the deal at the contract. We can't we
[00:25:25] like how tell me what's going on. So I don't remember the exact stories but what he was telling me
[00:25:29] and I started listening to the story was telling me it and when it became
[00:25:35] very relevant to me was that what was important to the Chinese was not important to him.
[00:25:40] And he could not see why these other things were important to them and it was a cultural issue.
[00:25:47] So I started talking to him about the reasons why these things were important to them and that
[00:25:52] he needed to give great importance to these and he immediately went out and closed a $100 million
[00:25:58] deal and then he closed a $200 million deal after that. And the guy just I mean that was it. I mean
[00:26:06] he was just he was on a rocket ship from that point on but he said something to me that was also
[00:26:12] the huge breakthrough for me. He's like I cannot believe that this was right in front of me and I
[00:26:18] couldn't see it and I'm literally losing tens of millions of dollars in commission because I
[00:26:24] can't see this problem and I'm like it's the craziest thing isn't it? You know it's like we see
[00:26:29] through this bias of our own and we try to make everything fit into that. So another another story
[00:26:36] short one was that a woman contacted me who was working through some other company that I did work
[00:26:42] for and she said maybe a chance do you work with real estate agents and I said well I have
[00:26:47] an occasion you know broker here broker there type of thing she said she said my brother is in
[00:26:52] the top 1% of real estate agents with potential reality in the company and this was right around
[00:27:00] when the the crisis happened in 08 and they're really having trouble right? Would you would you talk
[00:27:07] to them? And I said yeah sure I'll talk to them. So I started talking to them and by shifting what
[00:27:13] they were focusing on traditionally for them not considering what had changed because of this crisis
[00:27:20] that we were in they all became stuck and I had them up and selling within like 10 days
[00:27:26] from that but but they were so stuck in their mind that nobody would sell because of the crash
[00:27:33] in the market like they they had made up their mind that they couldn't do business. So after
[00:27:38] reframing it and getting them to reframe the idea of okay because here's something that I
[00:27:44] recognized very early on we're and actually I learned this working with salespeople.
[00:27:51] Salespeople would come up with the idea that because of some situation or reason people stop buying
[00:27:56] right? Oh people aren't buying because it's summer or it's a Christmas holiday or their kids are
[00:28:01] going back to school and I'm like that's all BS. It's complete BS there's two different value
[00:28:05] systems. You have people that have all the reasons not to buy because of search situations or
[00:28:11] circumstances in life possibly even the amount of money that's coming in or out of their life.
[00:28:16] Those things that value is higher on their on their priority than somebody else who has a
[00:28:22] different value set and what's more important to them right? They they buy with a different
[00:28:28] idea in their mind. If you change who your market is based on you're looking for a different value set
[00:28:34] instantly you will move from people that aren't buying to people that are buying and they had never
[00:28:39] thought of that before. So when they would do that they would go from not selling to selling instantly
[00:28:44] just by just by doing that. And of course then you have the people that don't believe you at all
[00:28:48] and they're just going to dig their heels in that they're right you're wrong. Sure. Yeah no this
[00:28:54] makes so much sense. You know I was thinking back to the Napoleon Hill quote and I forgot exactly
[00:29:00] how it was phrased the Sly opportunities this I do but opportunities that do this early.
[00:29:05] Sly disguises of opportunity. Sly disguises of opportunity I love that it reminds me of another phrase
[00:29:10] called called the elusive obvious. It's like it's right there but it's elusive. It's right in front
[00:29:17] of you and and you're absolutely right you know and that's happening right now in the in most
[00:29:22] REALTORS businesses today we have rates you know have doubled since they're lows of a few years ago
[00:29:28] even though rates are still relatively low in comparison to two years ago you know REALTORS are
[00:29:35] are going oh my gosh people people don't want to buy right now and it's like okay maybe the people
[00:29:40] that wanted to buy two years ago with a 3% interest rate yeah now that maybe they don't want to
[00:29:44] take a loan out for six and a half percent right now even though to me that's still pretty
[00:29:48] reasonable but maybe to them it isn't but there are lots of people who who will find opportunities
[00:29:54] to purchase or to sell property now that that but you're right it result it requires a shift in
[00:30:03] mindset for the agent to say okay where are these people that are are interested in taking advantage
[00:30:09] it's almost like buying a stock when it's undervalued that's right yes it's not it's it's harder to find
[00:30:13] people that you know we'll do that because it it goes against some just general sort of human
[00:30:19] behavior of oh it's it's it's it's you know at a loss right now do I want to buy something at a
[00:30:23] loss yes you do if you think it's going to go up but the vast majority of people don't maybe
[00:30:28] operate or think that way so you do have to change your mindset and then go okay well where are
[00:30:33] these people hanging out it reminds me of a quick story I heard from a release successful car
[00:30:37] dealer when this was back during the the oil embargo in the in the 70s when there was oil
[00:30:45] just massive oil or sorry gasoline shortages and so you know people weren't buying big cars because
[00:30:52] they it was too difficult to get gas and so these car salespeople were struggling and the really
[00:30:58] successful ones went well where do I where can I go where people don't care that much about this
[00:31:03] who can still buy luxury cars like oh what if I go hang out at a country club what if I drive
[00:31:07] one of my our fancy cars over there are those people still buying cars probably those are people
[00:31:12] least affected by something like that so so yes you're right there's always opportunity but
[00:31:17] you're right it's about understanding how do I how do I shift and it requires your right a
[00:31:22] shift in belief and attitude how do you say how do you suggest people start to examine their
[00:31:28] beliefs and then and then change them well that's that so that's a great point right there because
[00:31:33] you you talked about people coming into being a real estate agent or a broker because they would
[00:31:39] give them freedom but psychologically with the average business person does that's going to start
[00:31:45] their own business is they sell with the level that they believe is easiest for them sure right so
[00:31:51] they're so they may not go after the guy that sell the $10 million house they might go after somebody
[00:31:56] selling $130,000 house because that's what they see themselves as so part of it is to address that
[00:32:02] right how what lens are you actually seeing the business world through is it at your comfort level
[00:32:09] because just like you said with the go into the country club there are a ton of people out there
[00:32:14] that want to buy and sell right now because they have different reasons for buying and selling
[00:32:18] they're not nickel and diming their their ideas of what they want to commit to it that 3%
[00:32:25] doesn't mean anything to them they could care less right what the percentage is they just want to
[00:32:30] move or need to move for various different reasons and they're probably looking at at much
[00:32:35] bigger sales when they actually do that so the first thing that I say is if they're not seeing if
[00:32:41] they're actually not seeing that that opportunity then I challenge them to look at their own comfort
[00:32:49] zone for who they're actually selling to right because now that that opportunity has shifted the
[00:32:55] only way that they're going to be successful is if they grow out of that if they grow out of that
[00:32:59] level themselves then they have to actually start to see the opportunity at a different level so how
[00:33:05] can they internally shift their value set to go after a different type of a client maybe even
[00:33:12] increase their own goals in their life you know really go after more when that starts to click
[00:33:19] generally you see the alternative of that go like they'll start looking other people I got a
[00:33:24] 21 year old kid that is a broker he is a friend of my daughters and he's probably doing about
[00:33:32] 5 million a year right now man he just he's would he just goes after commercial real estate like he
[00:33:37] learned he watched he goes in he negotiates he finds things he looks for reasons people want to sell
[00:33:44] and he's just not going to debt and he's a he's a young guy with no experience I want to pause for a
[00:33:50] moment to talk about our episode sponsor are one of my favorite companies out there follow up boss

[00:35:05] boss with follow up boss and now back to our episode yeah it's it's really it's really impressive we
[00:35:12] we we bring on a lot of agents who are in their 20s who are killing it and because I always find like
[00:35:18] boy that just impresses me again most most people I knew in my early to mid 20s weren't buying and
[00:35:25] selling home so it wasn't like oh I could just you know hit up my friends who were buying condos no
[00:35:28] they weren't buying condos they were renting and living with roommates and all of that but
[00:35:32] you're you're absolutely right I think you know for anyone listening I think there's this if you
[00:35:40] get a little tinge in your stomach of discomfort when you think about well I would like to sell
[00:35:45] you know maybe it's more luxury properties or I want to make the switch to commercial if I'm
[00:35:49] residential or I just want to do something a little different than what is in my comfort zone you
[00:35:54] know if I'm selling homes that are 100 and you know like you said 140,000 and I really want to sell
[00:35:58] homes that are 300,000 and above you know it's it but it scares me like that I think is is an
[00:36:05] important thing to note is if you get a little bit scared but you know it's like the next part for
[00:36:10] you it's probably the right path so there's a little bit about getting comfortable with discomfort
[00:36:15] right I think that's like if you can tolerate that little pit in this near stomach and realize
[00:36:20] that's a signal that I'm a little bit scared to the next level but people get to the next level
[00:36:25] people do it and and so what would you recommend if you're like okay I want to get to that next level
[00:36:31] you know and I and I I'm not exactly sure you know but I you know I'm scared because I don't maybe
[00:36:37] I don't have the skill set yet to do that or I don't know how to reach those people you know what
[00:36:43] would you what would you recommend so the first thing that I recommend is I ask them what they really
[00:36:47] want what are your goals what do you really want because if you're really being honest with yourself
[00:36:53] part of your inner direction of what you desire will begin to lead you into the outer possibility of
[00:36:59] whatever that is that you're looking for but most people are not raised in an environment where
[00:37:04] it's okay for them to want what they want right so they're right you kind of raised with this idea
[00:37:08] like you don't need that only by which you need don't spend more than you need or you don't deserve it
[00:37:13] that's it that's absolutely absolutely so they so they so they get stuck in a financial frame in
[00:37:19] their mind that keeps them at a very low level and then when they do business they're they're
[00:37:23] actually looking for people who are struggling just like them so so that's one of the first things
[00:37:28] that I do there the other thing is is that kind of reframe the idea of fear because
[00:37:33] most people will say to me David how do I get rid of this fear like I just got all the all this
[00:37:38] fear and I'm like you don't you don't in a matter of fact you don't want to right here is actually a
[00:37:43] good thing it keeps us alive if we were removed all of your fear you'd probably be dead in a couple
[00:37:48] weeks because you wouldn't be alert to things that could actually kill you so the idea is what is
[00:37:55] fear doing for you all it's doing is it say hey here's something you should pay attention to
[00:38:00] it's not saying follow the fear it's not saying listen to the fear it's saying pay attention
[00:38:05] because there's something outside of the way that we're wired that is possible threat so pay
[00:38:11] attention but then you're supposed to use your intellect to evaluate whether or not this is a
[00:38:16] fear and if so why and if why then what is it that you need to do so that so it's about teaching
[00:38:22] a person how to think through the possibility of whatever fear is suggesting because it's not
[00:38:28] an absolute it's just a suggestion and it should be a suggestion that keeps us on our toes
[00:38:34] for what we're doing it helps us make better decisions the other thing is that if you make a
[00:38:39] decision and you made the wrong decision that's not a bad thing it's a great thing because it gives
[00:38:46] you real world data to reevaluate how you made the decision and then to go back and make a different
[00:38:52] right every entrepreneur fails their way to their success that I want I want to pause for a second
[00:39:00] because that is the most true thing I I have experienced I read that a lot certainly when I was
[00:39:07] growing up and yeah yeah yeah all you see all I would see is the success and of course you don't
[00:39:11] see the failures it's almost like looking on Instagram you don't you don't see as much of the
[00:39:16] botched meals that people make or you know the pictures of their spouses that haven't been retouched
[00:39:21] in the you know it's like we're not seeing videos of them yelling at having an argument with
[00:39:26] their children on you know but but this idea that learning actually comes from failure and failure
[00:39:32] not failure is probably the wrong word but but would not not getting the results you want or if you
[00:39:38] you know step on your own success and you you know make a mistake that that you know feels like it
[00:39:44] costs you you're absolutely right the most successful entrepreneurs I know are the ones that fail the
[00:39:49] most yeah absolutely and in our company we my CEO has developed something called sunshine in your
[00:39:58] mistakes which is you're we want you to make mistakes here right because if you're not making
[00:40:04] mistakes we're not stretching enough and if we're not stretching enough we're not learning and growing
[00:40:07] so it's constantly it's fine to make mistakes but it's weird because well it's not really weird
[00:40:13] anymore but it is an interesting thing that when people come to work for with us and they you
[00:40:20] start to bring them into that culture they're a little standoffish about it and the reason is
[00:40:25] is because people are taught mistakes are not okay we start learning that message in grade school
[00:40:30] and it's like no you've got to get it right you've got to get it perfect you can't you know you'll
[00:40:34] never be able to hold down a job if you screw things up and then you people that are paralyzed
[00:40:39] in the decision making process and nothing like you don't have any information until you make a
[00:40:46] decision you have to make a decision it doesn't matter whether it's right or wrong just make the decision
[00:40:51] and then we'll pick up the pieces as we go and make new ones yeah I agree um really well said I
[00:40:59] I have nothing more to add to that because it is so important to what's like that old expression feel
[00:41:06] the fear and do it anyway right like yes the fear is there pay attention and then I identify as this
[00:41:11] you know someone chasing me with a knife do I really need to run and and get out of harm's way
[00:41:16] maybe and then okay great and if it's if it's oh I'm just worried about failing I'm worried about
[00:41:22] you know taking my career to the next level good now you know what you're afraid of and now you can
[00:41:27] work to uh to reframe that and and learn whatever skills you need because again fear is like you
[00:41:33] said providing information to us there's something that's stopping me from moving forward now I
[00:41:38] identified what it is um oh it's this this glitch I have because my parents always told me I wouldn't
[00:41:43] be successful or whatever whatever the the backstory is okay that's your story that's that's fine
[00:41:48] and yes thankfully there there are paths forward um one of the things I wanted to talk about because
[00:41:54] I think REALTORS oftentimes you know as I said at the beginning they're wearing so many different
[00:41:59] hats they're basically every part of their company um and of course one person skill set uh
[00:42:05] inherent skill set to their their you know makeup a genetic makeup is probably not going to be
[00:42:10] sufficient to do every part of a business which is why you know uh why why there are employees at
[00:42:16] businesses that can do things that maybe other people can't do so I want to talk about delegation
[00:42:21] like delegating work because so many REALTORS are just solo practitioners um and I'm curious about
[00:42:27] your thoughts about how to delegate and and how somebody should identify parts of their business
[00:42:33] that they should step away from and and have someone else do for them great question so we have a saying
[00:42:39] when when there's a problem that shows up or there's too much work that shows up the question
[00:42:44] in your mind should be who not how who not how because you're not supposed to be doing all the work
[00:42:51] the uh the idea of a self-made person is a ridiculous idea there's no such thing
[00:42:58] and you know you're probably only really good at one or two things everything else you need to
[00:43:04] find people that are better than you so the so that you should be consistently thinking who not how
[00:43:08] and I need to build in the direction that I want to go I should not be hiring based on an emergency
[00:43:14] in my company but then it always comes down to well how are you going to pay for it well first of
[00:43:19] all you have to hire strategically but the idea is that the hiring of a person is supposed to free you
[00:43:25] up to go make more sales not bog you down to so that you can't actually pay for the person and
[00:43:31] what's really fascinating is that if you look at companies that really hire in with the idea of
[00:43:38] in the direction they want to grow as a company they always find a way to pay the people but you don't
[00:43:43] need to pay a person till you make a decision to actually hire the person to begin with right so
[00:43:49] when you make that decision you change yourself over to a completely different type of desire
[00:43:55] and necessity in your life to happen so you actually start manifesting more business by taking
[00:44:01] on more responsibility this is a really important point and and it isn't just a sort of a nice thing
[00:44:09] to say because it sounds good this is really important and and I think we all all of us listening have
[00:44:15] been in a situation where we wanted to get to some next level whether it's our career our
[00:44:21] relationships are our great great example so if we're not in a relationship we desire to be in one
[00:44:26] and we really work through what we want kind of partner we want the kind of partner we're going to be
[00:44:32] all of a sudden once that's kind of worked out and it doesn't work this way for everybody but for
[00:44:36] people who really put a lot of time in to going okay I want to get serious about you know finding a
[00:44:41] partner it does eventually show up it usually the right exact time but but it does it or some people
[00:44:49] just get lucky I guess and it happens you know when they least expect it but for most of us once we
[00:44:54] put our mind to something you're right all of a sudden the blinders almost come off and it's like our
[00:45:00] field of vision expands almost and I know that's kind of a you know it's a bit of a metaphor but
[00:45:05] but it actually sort of does happen you're right opportunities just start presenting themselves I
[00:45:10] I'll give you a perfect example so I've always been I didn't think of myself I realized I was
[00:45:16] very sensitive and I didn't know what that meant I just knew that I felt things maybe more deeply than
[00:45:21] than certain other people in my life and I I felt disconnected sometimes and I was you know I
[00:45:27] I cry easily and a few other things and so I started I was thinking about it not a couple of years
[00:45:33] ago I was in an airport and I go I wonder if there's a condition or not a condition but I wonder if
[00:45:37] there's something that there's like a category of people like I can't be the only person out there
[00:45:42] but my whole life I had just been told oh you're just too sensitive or you're whatever or and I
[00:45:47] would tell myself that and then I I just got to be some other people out there like me and so I
[00:45:51] Google it well sure enough there's a whole temperament it affects 20% of the population it's not
[00:45:56] a negative it's just a temperament and it's called highly sensitive and it's actually a legitimate
[00:46:00] thing and because I just said maybe this isn't a DJ thing maybe there's you know other people that
[00:46:07] that could you know help give me some guidance about what to do with the sensitivity it's not a
[00:46:11] bad thing it's just something you have to learn how to cope right all of a sudden I found this whole
[00:46:16] community and I went oh I'm not one out of every five people's like me and oh and there's all
[00:46:21] sorts of help I can get to help me learn skills to cope with this thing that I thought is a massive
[00:46:26] disadvantage for me it turns out it's not a disadvantage at all but but this idea you know 44
[00:46:32] years of my life I was like oh this is this awful burden I have to carry it's like actually you know
[00:46:37] now I can because I opened up my mind to maybe there's a there's this is called something and it's like
[00:46:42] oh wow and and now I've gotten immersed in that community and it's like oh yeah this is but you're
[00:46:47] right it's like it's about changing one's mindset and seeing what opportunities exist it's a great
[00:46:52] gift being an empath I mean the your sensitivity allows you to see things in people and read people
[00:47:01] in ways that other people can't even begin to understand yeah that is a fantastic gift to have
[00:47:07] it sure is and and back to delegating for a second because did you ever think that we would live
[00:47:14] at a time where we now can access work from all over the globe from people who don't live down the
[00:47:23] street who don't live in our local communities and if and if you can hire people locally that's
[00:47:28] awesome as well and I but not everyone can right away maybe the the finances just aren't there but
[00:47:33] you know you need help I mean it was a lot tougher to do that you know 20 years ago even and now
[00:47:39] you know with the with with us just being connected globally we can find help from all corners of
[00:47:45] the of the globe and oftentimes for for less money than maybe it that we couldn't afford to hire
[00:47:51] somebody locally for it that's right that's right yeah and we teach people how to do that all the time
[00:47:56] because it is a major it's a major obstacle in the mind of the person but I want to challenge
[00:48:02] everybody that's listening this like I'm not saying you have to believe me do investigate yourself
[00:48:08] listen to our podcast and you'll you'll begin to understand it because it does take a bit of time
[00:48:13] to understand it but let's let's be aware of something very important if your parents were not
[00:48:18] entrepreneurial you were basically raised middle class working class the rules and values for surviving
[00:48:25] financially when that's the class that you're raised by are completely different than if you're
[00:48:30] in business for yourself and I'm not saying it's bad I'm not doing a good bad comparison I'm just
[00:48:34] saying different and and and and and justifiably so if somebody else is completely in control of your
[00:48:41] income you're working for another person you have to make decisions based on that reality because
[00:48:46] you don't have the ability to increase your income it will but when you're in your own business
[00:48:50] you do have that ability so the more you understand that ability and you have the ability to exercise
[00:48:56] it it comes down to this I only have to be concerned about hiring somebody even if I don't have
[00:49:02] the money I only have to be concerned about hiring somebody if I'm not willing to do the work to
[00:49:07] pay for if I'm willing to do the work to pay for this person I can go ahead and hire anybody that I
[00:49:11] want and I can make that I can make the determination to make the money to be able to do it
[00:49:16] and I become extremely focused in that direction and we do that with companies every day
[00:49:22] every day and they're just astounded by the idea that they were just psychologically stuck that
[00:49:28] they couldn't do it because they didn't necessarily have the cash in hand to do it I'm like you
[00:49:33] don't need to have the cash in the hand you need to make the decision to do it and you need to make
[00:49:37] the decision that you're going to work in in in your sales to bring the money in to be able to do it.
[00:49:45] Changes it it really does and it's it's it almost appears as if sometimes by magic and and it isn't
[00:49:52] magic but there's a magical element to it that when we put our minds to something and we really commit
[00:49:59] and you know like I'm I'm I'm going to head to the gym here shortly and I nobody hates the gym
[00:50:05] more than me but all I did was I said look here's the reality I cannot I will not go by myself and I
[00:50:13] I'm I at the time was 44 years old I'm like I know myself I would love to go to the gym on my own
[00:50:18] it's not going to happen and there's a little defeatist attitude there but it was very honest I
[00:50:24] was like look I've been living in this body for 44 years I pretty much know what I motivated to do
[00:50:29] and not do but is there a solution can I still get fit well I had to go I'm just going to have to
[00:50:35] do the expensive option and hire a trainer and I thought I can't afford it it's it and it is an
[00:50:41] incredible amount of money and yet here I am two years later it's not that my income has dramatically
[00:50:47] shifted where I just now have so much money that I can hire trainers no I I did it even when I
[00:50:52] really couldn't afford it and sure enough the money showed up it just kept showing up it's not like
[00:50:58] you know it's it's not it showed enough showed up where I could continue to do that and here I am
[00:51:04] now two years later and it and I all I did was change my attitude I just went I'm going to have to pay
[00:51:09] for this I'm going to have to figure out a way to pay for this or else I'm not going to be healthy
[00:51:12] and and it was really that simple and you're absolutely right like I never thought I could
[00:51:17] afford to pay for that and somehow I did yeah yeah it's a it's a it's a very interesting dynamic with
[00:51:23] human beings when we are split focused on something all we do is see the confusion and the reasons
[00:51:29] that we can't when we make a decision we really focus in on what it is that we need and we have to
[00:51:35] understand something we're programmed to manifest what we need we will always get what we need but
[00:51:41] people aren't consciously aware of that will you become consciously aware of that everything in
[00:51:45] your life changes because you're like holy crap I had no idea that this would actually work if I
[00:51:51] if I did it but you have to be willing to try it in in order to be able to do it you got to step
[00:51:56] into those decisions to do it it I mean it completely changed my life and I got the first
[00:52:02] semblance of that when I made the decision to change my attitude and all of a sudden everything
[00:52:07] in my life changed because of it I'm like wait a minute what what thing matrix did I just walk
[00:52:13] through this isn't supposed to happen to a 17 year old dropout like it's not I'm not supposed to
[00:52:19] triple my income in a month but then you get and so that from there I went to from 50,000 a year
[00:52:24] to 50,000 a month and then over a million and then beyond that and it was like
[00:52:30] did it it just kept getting better but I kept doing the same principles that I was learning
[00:52:34] along the way and it's everybody else around me could not even begin to understand
[00:52:41] how this could even be possible except for the people that have gone before you
[00:52:46] of course who know it and and they look at you and go oh he's one of us he gets it and and and the
[00:52:53] good news too about pretty much every local community you know whether you live in rural Montana
[00:52:59] or Iowa or you're in a major city like you're you're outside of Charlotte I'm here in in Chicago
[00:53:05] there are people that have done this and and I would encourage you to beg plead with them to
[00:53:12] to develop a friendship or a relationship or at least take them out to coffee and say tell me about
[00:53:18] how do you start your day what do you what do you say when you wake up tears you know when you come
[00:53:22] across a problem or a challenge what are you doing and it's amazing success leaves clues doesn't it
[00:53:27] I mean people will just not even clues people will just tell you this is what I do yeah yeah and and
[00:53:32] the higher you go as far as successful people the more information that they'll give you
[00:53:38] because if you want to help people right I mean I want to help people that's when I learned
[00:53:42] how to do what I did when I became aware of it I'm like I thought at the time this is the greatest
[00:53:47] secret on the planet nobody knows that right I found something out I can't believe and and it was
[00:53:53] very true that many people don't know most people are not raised and that would that kind of a mindset
[00:53:58] and people will say to me well not you know come on mindset really isn't that like you know
[00:54:06] ooki gookie or you know and I'm like no it isn't mindset is the way you do anything right it is the
[00:54:12] way you think about things the way that you learn about things and your mindset is biased to the way
[00:54:17] that you are raised yeah so that's the only thing that you know but there's things way beyond what
[00:54:22] you know they can have an amazing impact like you said it's almost like magic on your life
[00:54:28] if people just don't know it and it might not come in the time frame that you're expecting in fact
[00:54:33] it likely won't it'll either take longer or shorter so that's also that another challenge is to
[00:54:39] is to commit to the activity or the discipline and trust that you know the answers will reveal
[00:54:46] themselves at the right time it just might not be the time that's most convenient for you absolutely
[00:54:52] tell us about the podcast so we've been talking about it and I want our audience to have a resource
[00:54:57] where they can go and reset their mind their expectations and again this is not from you know
[00:55:04] David's not a guy who knows the the sort of you know cool sounding phrases and things to say
[00:55:10] he actually consults businesses he you know he's worked with multi-billion dollar businesses
[00:55:15] this is somebody who is paid to get results so so I love that you have a podcast and you're not
[00:55:21] just a a self-help guy which you know some self-help guys are amazing but I like people that get
[00:55:27] results in the real world too and so tell us about the successful mind podcast so in in 2017
[00:55:35] I was I just I got the idea like I want to try a podcast at that point there were about 500,000
[00:55:42] podcasts today there's four million alone in in the United States right that's grown that much
[00:55:48] yeah so I I started it and I was doing it and me and my partner Steph Tuss
[00:55:55] what we were having a meeting with Gary Vangerchuk in New York in his office and we were sitting
[00:56:00] around just kind of shooting a shit with him and we were talking and he was like how's the podcast
[00:56:04] going and we're telling him and he says to me what what information are you putting out in the
[00:56:09] podcast right and we had been doing it for about a year at this point and I was telling him and
[00:56:13] he said is that your best information and I said what do you mean best he's like is that the
[00:56:18] results driven information that you would give a private client I'm like no and he said I want
[00:56:23] you to start giving he said I challenge you to start giving that information for free on the
[00:56:27] podcast and I'm like are you kidding me he's like my secret sauce I can't give that for free yeah so
[00:56:34] then he says something to me that really kind of changed my my vision on something he's told me
[00:56:38] he's a David let me ask you a question he said just honest just between us is there anything that
[00:56:44] you teach that if a person knew what it was they couldn't find it on the internet right and I'm
[00:56:50] like that's a good point he's like it's the same thing with me he said so they're not paying for
[00:56:56] the information they're paying for contact right so when you get when you consult somebody they're
[00:57:00] paying for contact they're paying for strategy they're paying for that but the information itself
[00:57:05] they could get anywhere they just don't know what it is he said so if you give enough of that
[00:57:10] information you're going to grow your business and or they don't know who to trust they don't know
[00:57:14] whose information is accurate and and you can build your brand through a podcast of hey I
[00:57:21] I am an authority figure here I do actually have real world experience and results let me let me
[00:57:27] tell you what I do and then you're right even though it maybe you didn't you know create all of
[00:57:34] your own learning you've learned it through others and through other experience you still can be
[00:57:38] of incredible value to people even if you give away the secret sauce yes and that's so that's
[00:57:43] started doing we're like okay I'm gonna give this a try and see what happens our major concern was
[00:57:47] that it would piss off our private clients that like they get angry because they're going we're
[00:57:51] paying for this we never had one of them even even say that it wasn't even a thought on their mind
[00:57:56] but what did happen was that every time that we would do a live event or a seminar or a speaking
[00:58:03] engagement or something one of the one of the things that we would ask people out of form would be how
[00:58:08] did you hear about us and almost overnight we started getting tons of people going the podcast the
[00:58:14] podcast yeah that was our first introduction now it's hard to measure that as you know right I mean
[00:58:19] because you don't get this much data very little unfortunately very little exactly right it's not
[00:58:25] like you it's not like your regular marketing campaigns that give you tons of information but
[00:58:30] you do get the information on the opposite side when you ask people how did you first hear about
[00:58:34] us and they tell you it's the podcast you know that thing is working and you know I mean we went
[00:58:40] over two million views in a relatively short period of time without any marketing agenda on our end
[00:58:46] just putting it out there so it's spread by word of mouth so it's a it's a really great thing
[00:58:51] and there's a ton of teaching on there and there's also we just started something new me and
[00:58:56] Steph Tuss she's my CEO of my company and we were currently once a week we're telling stories based
[00:59:03] on real challenges the companies that we work with have and how we're actually fixing those things
[00:59:09] for people so so that so we're doing that and people are loving what they're loving it so check it out
[00:59:15] yeah so everyone I want everyone to consider no I'm not don't consider just subscribe listen to one
[00:59:21] episode see if you like it because you know all sometimes what you what you all you really need is
[00:59:28] a different voice telling you this telling you in some cases things you already know sure but
[00:59:32] if it's coming from an outside source that you trust and that has authority a lot of times that
[00:59:38] can sort of sink in a lot a lot easier than trying to convince yourself of something that you know maybe
[00:59:43] you read in a book at some point but never implemented so give give David's voice and and his
[00:59:49] partners voice a shot because they get results so everyone subscribe to the successful mind

[01:00:38] improvements and adjustments along the way but am I putting out my very best content I I need to
[01:00:44] examine that and think about you know what I could be adding or subtracting from the show to
[01:00:49] make it better so the best way that you guys can help me do that is by letting me know what you

Thanks for having me, it's an honor to be here. Well, it's an honor to have you. I am always interested. I've always been fascinated by consultants because I just love essentially they're problem solvers and this idea of real estate agents are so often their own CEO, their own customer service team, a lot of times so many of our listeners, it's just them, and they're running the entire company. They have to wear every single hat and this idea of getting a coaching experience or having some third party person come in and say, hey, here's some tweaks that you may want to consider. It's very, very exciting and most of our listeners just don't have that, so I'm excited to get some insight into you about maybe ways they could improve their mindset or part of their behavior to help actually get them more results, but without just working more hours, I know that's a huge one of your tenences. There's ways to become more productive without just pushing and grinding it out more, but before we get to all that, I want to hear more about you and your story. Can you tell us a little bit about your journey in the business world and how you ended up in consulting? Yeah, it's an interesting journey. It's a very interesting journey. As we were talking about off-air, I was born and raised in Chicago and from about 13 on, my life was kind of taking a bit of a different twist because my parents got divorced and we were kind of just left alone, me and my brother, to really kind of bring ourselves up. There was not a lot of engagement or near as much as there should have been. So I was making a lot of mistakes, and I never liked school as a kid. I didn't like to read. I have a library that's over 4,000 books that I've read them all. So it's a really weird twist, but at 17 years old, I quit high school. I went into the army, got out of the army, came home, got married, but I had no skills. I guarded nuclear bases in the army in Germany. So I didn't really have anything that transferred over into a skill. I got my GED in the army, but I had no other formal education. So I just went to work, got married, we had a couple of kids, and I found out really quickly that I was creating more responsibility that I had the ability to actually stand up and handle. I didn't have the skill sets to be able to provide financially for my family, but I didn't know what to do to change it. And the other thing was that I was around, the people that I was around, I would ask for help. Like, can you give me some advice as to what to do? And all they would say to me is you should not quit high school. It's like, yeah, how do you get that now? I realized the error, okay, but I can't go back and change that. So what do I do now? But they really couldn't give me any advice. They would just say work harder, work all the overtime that you can. In the late 80s, I had a brief stint working for metropolitan life insurance company selling insurance, which was actually going well until the savings and loan crisis hit. And then my policies were dropped. Like people were dropping policies left and right, right? They just couldn't afford them. So my paycheck went down so low that I couldn't stay working there. And the only other thing I could do was drive a truck or drive a forklift. So I went to work for a warehouse in Lyle, Illinois, Keehee Foods. And at the time, Mr. Keehee was the largest food importer in the country. And most of the things that we get and appreciate are because he brought those things in and really supplied, especially really heavily supplied them to the Midwest area of the country. So I was working there, but I wasn't doing well. I hated what I did. I didn't like it. I didn't see any future for myself. I felt extremely stuck and things are progressively getting worse. So I wake up one morning and our cars repossessed, right? And we end up filing for bankruptcy. We have to leave our apartment in the middle of the night because we can no longer afford to live there. So we have to move to a really bad neighborhood way down south by Joliet and I have to work, have to drive in to Lyle to go to work. So it's things are getting really bad. And I was more and more humiliated by the day where we were living, where we were bringing our kids up. The stories that I was hearing about was happening there during the day while I was at work. Sure. And I got to work one day and I got reprimanded twice before I even punched it. So I was already in the worst possible mood. I was tired. I was exhausted. I was working six and a half days a week. And I was in this trailer. I was loading food into this trailer and I broke down and just started crying. And I was like, God, please show me something. Anything how to get out of this. I don't know how to turn this around. Because my thought was I have to go to college, but I need time and money to do that. This is before the internet. I mean, there was no, you had to go to a physical building. You had to, you know, spend time to go get an education. And it was not a possibility at that time in my life. So I had this voice in my head said, change your attitude that night. Like it was very, it was like very loud in my head. It said, change your attitude. And I started playing with that idea and really long story short. I changed three things in my attitude. And I said, I am really going to see if there's anything to this. Like it can this work because it wasn't that I hadn't heard that before. That's a teacher who used to tell my parents when I was a kid. You know, like, Dave's a pretty smart guy. If he would change his attitude about school, he would do well. But I hated school. I just couldn't stand it. He just hated being there. So I started acting like I loved what I did. I started treating people with respect because actually what it wasn't that I was the mean person. I was angry and didn't know what to do with that anger. So I was taking it out disrespectfully to other people. And I really wasn't doing the best job that I could because nobody ever showed me how to do that. So I was working to go home. I was raised in a in a in a union environment, so to speak in in Chicago. And it was only about doing what you're paid for. Wasn't there was no attitude about really trying to work your way to the top doing more than you're paid for, right? That kind of a of an ideal. I did not have that. So in I changed this and make this change. I'm like, I'm going to do this for a year and see if it if anything changes in my life because I didn't know what else to do. In 30 days, I tripled my income. Wow. Yeah. Well, I was right. How did that happen? How did that happen? In a year, well, I'm 20,000 a year to 62,000 in 30 days. And it's so spun my head around that I thought to myself, how can this possibly be? How can I how can I make this change and have this happen in in 30 days? And what what became very interesting to observe was that the opportunity to do that had been around me for two years, but I didn't see it as an opportunity because I was looking through a lens of being angry and blaming and victimized everywhere that I went. And what happened was there was this guy that used to come to our dock at Kiihi Foods twice a week, every Tuesday and every Thursday. And he drove a fuel truck out of Lamont, okay? A company called Asco Fuel, okay? They did a big red truck. She probably seen them downtown. Yeah. Right? So he would come, he would come every Tuesday, every Thursday and he filled our trucks with fuel. And he also filled the trailers because they were refrigerated trailers. So they had to fill them with diesel fuel. Part of my job was to make sure that he filled the right ones, the ones that we loaded with food. Check his ticket off and then, you know, let's send him on his way. But the guy always wreaked a diesel fuel like he really stuck. He had to be outside working, whether it was like a hundred degrees in mosquitoes and humans that gets in Chicago or if it was 20 below out there or if it was pouring rain, he was always out in the element. And I used to think to myself, at least I'm underneath this dock, you know, I got this dock over my head like this is some big. This guy's got a real bad. Yeah, exactly. And I get to know this guy over two years. His name was Drew Batti. He said, I think this change, he comes up to me one day and he says, how long are you going to stay here? Is he new that I wanted to get out that I was looking for something else? And I'm like, Drew, I don't know, you know, I have, I have absolutely no idea. Like I would so do something if I only knew what to do. And he said, why don't you come to work with me like come to work, run work. And I'm like, and I started ripping on the guy, right? I started in front of him. And I'm like, dude, you drive a bomb on wheels. You deliver fuel. Like I don't want to do that. I said, I actually said this, said this to him. I'm like, is anybody ever died? Drive me one. That's a reasonable question. I thought so. And he says to me, yes, last year, a guy, a guy going down 65, and he driving down the Indiana flips it and he burns to death. And I'm like, say what I mean, I don't want to come work for. I don't want to work with you. And I made this, I made the real insulting comment to him. I said, besides all of that, I said, how much could you possibly be making? Well, last year, I made 50,000. Wow. And I went, what? And like get out of here. You didn't make no 50,000 driving that thing. I don't know what I was thinking. Like I don't know what I was comparing it to in my mind, but it was pure ignorance on my part. Sure. And he says, I will bring you my check stuff next week when I come in. I'll show you. You don't believe me. I'm like, yeah, you do that, right? Next week he comes and he shows me and he had made a little over 50,000. And I'm like, you're kidding me. So all of a sudden, I'm now looking at this, like, maybe this is an opportunity. Pay attention here. I had a ton of questions. I had to get over all kinds of personal fear about what this was. Sure. Long story short, though, I went, I went there within a week. I got hired. I started working in my income triple instantly. Amazing. And the thing was this, because this could have been a story where I went to work there. I acted like I got lucky. I worked really hard in either state of truck driver there for the rest of my life because there were guys that did that. They're like their whole career drive in those fuel trucks. Or maybe I could have gotten into management. It was a small family on company. So that was kind of rare. But I didn't look at it as luck. I didn't believe in luck. I thought to myself, I did something that caused this. I just don't know what it is. And what, so I started, I pulled out a copy of Think and Grow Rich that I had when I worked for Metropolitan life. And in the introduction, there's a, there's a thing called the Slime Disguises of Opportunity. And Hill says that most people miss opportunity because they don't see it as opportunity. They see it as being unfortunate or misfortune or temporary defeat. They don't actually see the opportunity that's in front of them. And when I read that, I thought to myself, that's what this is. That's why I didn't see this for two years because I was looking at it as something that it's not. I got so fascinated by that idea. I'm like I got to learn more. So I started reading everything I could get my hands on. I started going to seminars. I went to like Tony Robbins in like 1993 and everybody's like, RAH-RAH. I thought it was like, this is the coolest thing in the world. I didn't even know this world existed. And I was on this path for about seven years. And I started working with people because everybody saw my life changing. It just kept getting better and better and better. I started out at this company driving a truck when I left. I was in charge of expanding the company across the country. And I never went to school. I just kept learning on the job and playing myself the best that I could. And people would say to me, can I fix my business? Do you have any idea what I could do different? And I would give them advice and they would do it and they would start winning. And I'm like, this is a business. It's actually this month on 1999, October of 1999 is when I started the business 24 years ago. And I started it. I walked away from what I was doing and I never went back. And it's been a journey of a lifetime. It's just been unbelievable. Well, you have, first of all, congratulations on 24 years in the consulting business. And also thank you for your service as well. I know that you said that earlier in the story, but something that that, you know, I think is important to for us that are not in military service to realize that sometimes, you know, soldiers or people that you know are in the military, whether they're soldiers or not, are coming home. They're finishing up their commitment. And maybe they don't, I mean, I'm sure there's more opportunities now for them to develop skills than then existed when you when you were there. But some people come back and they don't know what to do and they don't have those skills. So it's important. Remember that. Yeah. And they're mess. Yeah. So, you know, here, I was interviewing a Lieutenant Curl at my own podcast a couple of weeks ago and he told me he said, you know, we lost about 7,000 men and women in the Afghan war. He said, but we've lost over 30,000 due to suicide since they've come back. And he was telling me just, you know, the PTSD, the mental illness is horrific and we're not yes. And obviously there is. So if any of us know veterans and people that come back like, let's let's put on our empathy and compassion hats and let's figure out how what we can do to help serve them as they served us. But I also wanted to to mention you, as you were talking about your own journey, I was thinking about it's probably the name of a book. It certainly isn't a phrase I made up, although I'd love to say that I did. But it sounded like a lot of it was this gift of desperation, right? You had responsibilities. You know, if you were had been a single guy and, you know, early on in life where you sort of like, yeah, I have a crappy job. I'm not, you know, I don't see a lot of room for improvement, but it's only me. I'm only so dealing with my own self that maybe isn't for some people as painful as, oh, I have, you know, a family to support. I have, you know, trying to figure out I have bills to pay. I have all these responsibilities and I'm stuck. And I think a lot of even our listeners who who get in get their real estate license probably a big chunk of the reason why is they want freedom. They want the freedom to work when they'd like to. They want the ability to be their own boss. Of course, nobody tells them like that's a lot to do. And it's not the easiest thing to figure out on your own, which is why coaching exists and consultants. And but it's a really hard thing for an individual practitioner to figure out. But I love the fact that as you sort of, you know, progress through your career, even though you were in what, you know, admittedly lower level or lower skilled jobs, you said your idea was, well, if I change my attitude, let's just let's just test this out and see, is there an empirical result? Is there, you know, is my life actually going to look differently? And it tripled your salary because you did identify an opportunity that at first glance was not an opportunity. It was like, oh, that would be a demotion. If I were to come work for you, I might, I might, you know, have injury or die. And also, there's way you make it any money or you're the guy filling our trucks. And sure enough, no, there was because, you know, that person was was kind enough to to look past some of the Joaquin salts and go, actually, I do pretty well. And you should come work with me. And you were smart enough or maybe desperate enough or whatever that part is to be able to go, oh, okay, this is a real thing. And then take action. And I think you're right. It's like mindset really allows people like you were saying in the Napoleon Hill book, you know, to some of some of, some of these opportunities that come to us don't seem like opportunities. They almost might even seem like problems. And this idea of keeping your mind open enough to see a different path is exactly what you did. And then when you went to work for this, this smaller company, which you said, really didn't have a lot of obvious opportunity because it's a family run business. They're going to be promoting probably from within. I don't know if I'm even going to progress. But the one thing that I'm sorry to keep going on and on, but I just wanted to you reminded me of something that I think is so important, which is which I wish, in my parents did a wonderful job raising me. But one thing I wish it would have been drilled into me a little bit more was that even I was like a dishwasher when I was a teenager and I had those super low skill level jobs. And it's really hard work is working in a warehouse is crazy hard. I did construction. I did a lot of those kind of tasks. And every boss at any of those companies, whether it's a small family firm or a large, they really are just looking for somebody to shine in whatever position it is. And like the boss goes, Oh, thank God, this person cares. And we're going to keep our eye on this person. And opportunities do become available not every time, but but in a lot of instances. Or if the company you're at doesn't recognize how well you're doing other people will. And and they'll might extend opportunities to you. So I love that story. Okay, so thank you for that. And I really was just really taken in by by your journey. And it's really obviously very inspiring. So as you I know you you know work with with a lot of different businesses and also with real estate agents, I want to talk about mindset because you're really talked about you know changing attitude, you know whether we call it attitude mindset. Love to hear sort of what your thoughts are on how somebody could actually start to to to identify maybe mindset challenges that they're experiencing and then what they can do about it. Let me tell you about a couple of interesting things that happened to me with real estate people along my journey. Very early on, one of the first that I can remember real estate people that I that that hired me was a guy who was doing land deals, right. And he was pretty successful here in the States doing land deals and then the Chinese started to come in and they were buying up enormous plots of land. These were $100 million deals. And where he was succeeding before he was completely failing. So I don't remember how he got introduced to me. And I had never really done anything with real estate before but I had a conversation with him and he hired me and I said well tell me what's going on. He was like I can't figure it out like I'm succeeding over here. He says but every every one of these huge deals that I try to close with the Chinese it's like it's just going out the window. Well when here's something that's interesting I had some experience working with some Chinese companies and they do business different. You know there are number one they're very meticulous about the bottom line and all the different pieces of a contract that may not be important to us here but they're very important it's very important to them. So anyway so he's telling me the story and I said well where are you losing the deal. And he's like it's at the contract. We're losing the deal at the contract. We can't we like how tell me what's going on. So I don't remember the exact stories but what he was telling me and I started listening to the story was telling me it and when it became very relevant to me was that what was important to the Chinese was not important to him. And he could not see why these other things were important to them and it was a cultural issue. So I started talking to him about the reasons why these things were important to them and that he needed to give great importance to these and he immediately went out and closed a $100 million deal and then he closed a $200 million deal after that. And the guy just I mean that was it. I mean he was just he was on a rocket ship from that point on but he said something to me that was also the huge breakthrough for me. He's like I cannot believe that this was right in front of me and I couldn't see it and I'm literally losing tens of millions of dollars in commission because I can't see this problem and I'm like it's the craziest thing isn't it? You know it's like we see through this bias of our own and we try to make everything fit into that. So another another story short one was that a woman contacted me who was working through some other company that I did work for and she said maybe a chance do you work with real estate agents and I said well I have an occasion you know broker here broker there type of thing she said she said my brother is in the top 1% of real estate agents with potential reality in the company and this was right around when the the crisis happened in 08 and they're really having trouble right? Would you would you talk to them? And I said yeah sure I'll talk to them. So I started talking to them and by shifting what they were focusing on traditionally for them not considering what had changed because of this crisis that we were in they all became stuck and I had them up and selling within like 10 days from that but but they were so stuck in their mind that nobody would sell because of the crash in the market like they they had made up their mind that they couldn't do business. So after reframing it and getting them to reframe the idea of okay because here's something that I recognized very early on we're and actually I learned this working with salespeople. Salespeople would come up with the idea that because of some situation or reason people stop buying right? Oh people aren't buying because it's summer or it's a Christmas holiday or their kids are going back to school and I'm like that's all BS. It's complete BS there's two different value systems. You have people that have all the reasons not to buy because of search situations or circumstances in life possibly even the amount of money that's coming in or out of their life. Those things that value is higher on their on their priority than somebody else who has a different value set and what's more important to them right? They they buy with a different idea in their mind. If you change who your market is based on you're looking for a different value set instantly you will move from people that aren't buying to people that are buying and they had never thought of that before. So when they would do that they would go from not selling to selling instantly just by just by doing that. And of course then you have the people that don't believe you at all and they're just going to dig their heels in that they're right you're wrong. Sure. Yeah no this makes so much sense. You know I was thinking back to the Napoleon Hill quote and I forgot exactly how it was phrased the Sly opportunities this I do but opportunities that do this early. Sly disguises of opportunity. Sly disguises of opportunity I love that it reminds me of another phrase called called the elusive obvious. It's like it's right there but it's elusive. It's right in front of you and and you're absolutely right you know and that's happening right now in the in most REALTORS businesses today we have rates you know have doubled since they're lows of a few years ago even though rates are still relatively low in comparison to two years ago you know REALTORS are are going oh my gosh people people don't want to buy right now and it's like okay maybe the people that wanted to buy two years ago with a 3% interest rate yeah now that maybe they don't want to take a loan out for six and a half percent right now even though to me that's still pretty reasonable but maybe to them it isn't but there are lots of people who who will find opportunities to purchase or to sell property now that that but you're right it result it requires a shift in mindset for the agent to say okay where are these people that are are interested in taking advantage it's almost like buying a stock when it's undervalued that's right yes it's not it's it's harder to find people that you know we'll do that because it it goes against some just general sort of human behavior of oh it's it's it's it's you know at a loss right now do I want to buy something at a loss yes you do if you think it's going to go up but the vast majority of people don't maybe operate or think that way so you do have to change your mindset and then go okay well where are these people hanging out it reminds me of a quick story I heard from a release successful car dealer when this was back during the the oil embargo in the in the 70s when there was oil just massive oil or sorry gasoline shortages and so you know people weren't buying big cars because they it was too difficult to get gas and so these car salespeople were struggling and the really successful ones went well where do I where can I go where people don't care that much about this who can still buy luxury cars like oh what if I go hang out at a country club what if I drive one of my our fancy cars over there are those people still buying cars probably those are people least affected by something like that so so yes you're right there's always opportunity but you're right it's about understanding how do I how do I shift and it requires your right a shift in belief and attitude how do you say how do you suggest people start to examine their beliefs and then and then change them well that's that so that's a great point right there because you you talked about people coming into being a real estate agent or a broker because they would give them freedom but psychologically with the average business person does that's going to start their own business is they sell with the level that they believe is easiest for them sure right so they're so they may not go after the guy that sell the $10 million house they might go after somebody selling $130,000 house because that's what they see themselves as so part of it is to address that right how what lens are you actually seeing the business world through is it at your comfort level because just like you said with the go into the country club there are a ton of people out there that want to buy and sell right now because they have different reasons for buying and selling they're not nickel and diming their their ideas of what they want to commit to it that 3% doesn't mean anything to them they could care less right what the percentage is they just want to move or need to move for various different reasons and they're probably looking at at much bigger sales when they actually do that so the first thing that I say is if they're not seeing if they're actually not seeing that that opportunity then I challenge them to look at their own comfort zone for who they're actually selling to right because now that that opportunity has shifted the only way that they're going to be successful is if they grow out of that if they grow out of that level themselves then they have to actually start to see the opportunity at a different level so how can they internally shift their value set to go after a different type of a client maybe even increase their own goals in their life you know really go after more when that starts to click generally you see the alternative of that go like they'll start looking other people I got a 21 year old kid that is a broker he is a friend of my daughters and he's probably doing about 5 million a year right now man he just he's would he just goes after commercial real estate like he learned he watched he goes in he negotiates he finds things he looks for reasons people want to sell and he's just not going to debt and he's a he's a young guy with no experience I want to pause for a moment to talk about our episode sponsor are one of my favorite companies out there follow

boss with follow up boss and now back to our episode yeah it's it's really it's really impressive we we we bring on a lot of agents who are in their 20s who are killing it and because I always find like boy that just impresses me again most most people I knew in my early to mid 20s weren't buying and selling home so it wasn't like oh I could just you know hit up my friends who were buying condos no they weren't buying condos they were renting and living with roommates and all of that but you're you're absolutely right I think you know for anyone listening I think there's this if you get a little tinge in your stomach of discomfort when you think about well I would like to sell you know maybe it's more luxury properties or I want to make the switch to commercial if I'm residential or I just want to do something a little different than what is in my comfort zone you know if I'm selling homes that are 100 and you know like you said 140,000 and I really want to sell homes that are 300,000 and above you know it's it but it scares me like that I think is is an important thing to note is if you get a little bit scared but you know it's like the next part for you it's probably the right path so there's a little bit about getting comfortable with discomfort right I think that's like if you can tolerate that little pit in this near stomach and realize that's a signal that I'm a little bit scared to the next level but people get to the next level people do it and and so what would you recommend if you're like okay I want to get to that next level you know and I and I I'm not exactly sure you know but I you know I'm scared because I don't maybe I don't have the skill set yet to do that or I don't know how to reach those people you know what would you what would you recommend so the first thing that I recommend is I ask them what they really want what are your goals what do you really want because if you're really being honest with yourself part of your inner direction of what you desire will begin to lead you into the outer possibility of whatever that is that you're looking for but most people are not raised in an environment where it's okay for them to want what they want right so they're right you kind of raised with this idea like you don't need that only by which you need don't spend more than you need or you don't deserve it that's it that's absolutely absolutely so they so they so they get stuck in a financial frame in their mind that keeps them at a very low level and then when they do business they're they're actually looking for people who are struggling just like them so so that's one of the first things that I do there the other thing is is that kind of reframe the idea of fear because most people will say to me David how do I get rid of this fear like I just got all the all this fear and I'm like you don't you don't in a matter of fact you don't want to right here is actually a good thing it keeps us alive if we were removed all of your fear you'd probably be dead in a couple weeks because you wouldn't be alert to things that could actually kill you so the idea is what is fear doing for you all it's doing is it say hey here's something you should pay attention to it's not saying follow the fear it's not saying listen to the fear it's saying pay attention because there's something outside of the way that we're wired that is possible threat so pay attention but then you're supposed to use your intellect to evaluate whether or not this is a fear and if so why and if why then what is it that you need to do so that so it's about teaching a person how to think through the possibility of whatever fear is suggesting because it's not an absolute it's just a suggestion and it should be a suggestion that keeps us on our toes for what we're doing it helps us make better decisions the other thing is that if you make a decision and you made the wrong decision that's not a bad thing it's a great thing because it gives you real world data to reevaluate how you made the decision and then to go back and make a different right every entrepreneur fails their way to their success that I want I want to pause for a second because that is the most true thing I I have experienced I read that a lot certainly when I was growing up and yeah yeah yeah all you see all I would see is the success and of course you don't see the failures it's almost like looking on Instagram you don't you don't see as much of the botched meals that people make or you know the pictures of their spouses that haven't been retouched in the you know it's like we're not seeing videos of them yelling at having an argument with their children on you know but but this idea that learning actually comes from failure and failure not failure is probably the wrong word but but would not not getting the results you want or if you you know step on your own success and you you know make a mistake that that you know feels like it costs you you're absolutely right the most successful entrepreneurs I know are the ones that fail the most yeah absolutely and in our company we my CEO has developed something called sunshine in your mistakes which is you're we want you to make mistakes here right because if you're not making mistakes we're not stretching enough and if we're not stretching enough we're not learning and growing so it's constantly it's fine to make mistakes but it's weird because well it's not really weird anymore but it is an interesting thing that when people come to work for with us and they you start to bring them into that culture they're a little standoffish about it and the reason is is because people are taught mistakes are not okay we start learning that message in grade school and it's like no you've got to get it right you've got to get it perfect you can't you know you'll never be able to hold down a job if you screw things up and then you people that are paralyzed in the decision making process and nothing like you don't have any information until you make a decision you have to make a decision it doesn't matter whether it's right or wrong just make the decision and then we'll pick up the pieces as we go and make new ones yeah I agree um really well said I I have nothing more to add to that because it is so important to what's like that old expression feel the fear and do it anyway right like yes the fear is there pay attention and then I identify as this you know someone chasing me with a knife do I really need to run and and get out of harm's way maybe and then okay great and if it's if it's oh I'm just worried about failing I'm worried about you know taking my career to the next level good now you know what you're afraid of and now you can work to uh to reframe that and and learn whatever skills you need because again fear is like you said providing information to us there's something that's stopping me from moving forward now I identified what it is um oh it's this this glitch I have because my parents always told me I wouldn't be successful or whatever whatever the the backstory is okay that's your story that's that's fine and yes thankfully there there are paths forward um one of the things I wanted to talk about because I think REALTORS oftentimes you know as I said at the beginning they're wearing so many different hats they're basically every part of their company um and of course one person skill set uh inherent skill set to their their you know makeup a genetic makeup is probably not going to be sufficient to do every part of a business which is why you know uh why why there are employees at businesses that can do things that maybe other people can't do so I want to talk about delegation like delegating work because so many REALTORS are just solo practitioners um and I'm curious about your thoughts about how to delegate and and how somebody should identify parts of their business that they should step away from and and have someone else do for them great question so we have a saying when when there's a problem that shows up or there's too much work that shows up the question in your mind should be who not how who not how because you're not supposed to be doing all the work the uh the idea of a self-made person is a ridiculous idea there's no such thing and you know you're probably only really good at one or two things everything else you need to find people that are better than you so the so that you should be consistently thinking who not how and I need to build in the direction that I want to go I should not be hiring based on an emergency in my company but then it always comes down to well how are you going to pay for it well first of all you have to hire strategically but the idea is that the hiring of a person is supposed to free you up to go make more sales not bog you down to so that you can't actually pay for the person and what's really fascinating is that if you look at companies that really hire in with the idea of in the direction they want to grow as a company they always find a way to pay the people but you don't need to pay a person till you make a decision to actually hire the person to begin with right so when you make that decision you change yourself over to a completely different type of desire and necessity in your life to happen so you actually start manifesting more business by taking on more responsibility this is a really important point and and it isn't just a sort of a nice thing to say because it sounds good this is really important and and I think we all all of us listening have been in a situation where we wanted to get to some next level whether it's our career our relationships are our great great example so if we're not in a relationship we desire to be in one and we really work through what we want kind of partner we want the kind of partner we're going to be all of a sudden once that's kind of worked out and it doesn't work this way for everybody but for people who really put a lot of time in to going okay I want to get serious about you know finding a partner it does eventually show up it usually the right exact time but but it does it or some people just get lucky I guess and it happens you know when they least expect it but for most of us once we put our mind to something you're right all of a sudden the blinders almost come off and it's like our field of vision expands almost and I know that's kind of a you know it's a bit of a metaphor but but it actually sort of does happen you're right opportunities just start presenting themselves I I'll give you a perfect example so I've always been I didn't think of myself I realized I was very sensitive and I didn't know what that meant I just knew that I felt things maybe more deeply than than certain other people in my life and I I felt disconnected sometimes and I was you know I I cry easily and a few other things and so I started I was thinking about it not a couple of years ago I was in an airport and I go I wonder if there's a condition or not a condition but I wonder if there's something that there's like a category of people like I can't be the only person out there but my whole life I had just been told oh you're just too sensitive or you're whatever or and I would tell myself that and then I I just got to be some other people out there like me and so I Google it well sure enough there's a whole temperament it affects 20% of the population it's not a negative it's just a temperament and it's called highly sensitive and it's actually a legitimate thing and because I just said maybe this isn't a DJ thing maybe there's you know other people that that could you know help give me some guidance about what to do with the sensitivity it's not a bad thing it's just something you have to learn how to cope right all of a sudden I found this whole community and I went oh I'm not one out of every five people's like me and oh and there's all sorts of help I can get to help me learn skills to cope with this thing that I thought is a massive disadvantage for me it turns out it's not a disadvantage at all but but this idea you know 44 years of my life I was like oh this is this awful burden I have to carry it's like actually you know now I can because I opened up my mind to maybe there's a there's this is called something and it's like oh wow and and now I've gotten immersed in that community and it's like oh yeah this is but you're right it's like it's about changing one's mindset and seeing what opportunities exist it's a great gift being an empath I mean the your sensitivity allows you to see things in people and read people in ways that other people can't even begin to understand yeah that is a fantastic gift to have it sure is and and back to delegating for a second because did you ever think that we would live at a time where we now can access work from all over the globe from people who don't live down the street who don't live in our local communities and if and if you can hire people locally that's awesome as well and I but not everyone can right away maybe the the finances just aren't there but you know you need help I mean it was a lot tougher to do that you know 20 years ago even and now you know with the with with us just being connected globally we can find help from all corners of the of the globe and oftentimes for for less money than maybe it that we couldn't afford to hire somebody locally for it that's right that's right yeah and we teach people how to do that all the time because it is a major it's a major obstacle in the mind of the person but I want to challenge everybody that's listening this like I'm not saying you have to believe me do investigate yourself listen to our podcast and you'll you'll begin to understand it because it does take a bit of time to understand it but let's let's be aware of something very important if your parents were not entrepreneurial you were basically raised middle class working class the rules and values for surviving financially when that's the class that you're raised by are completely different than if you're in business for yourself and I'm not saying it's bad I'm not doing a good bad comparison I'm just saying different and and and and and justifiably so if somebody else is completely in control of your income you're working for another person you have to make decisions based on that reality because you don't have the ability to increase your income it will but when you're in your own business you do have that ability so the more you understand that ability and you have the ability to exercise it it comes down to this I only have to be concerned about hiring somebody even if I don't have the money I only have to be concerned about hiring somebody if I'm not willing to do the work to pay for if I'm willing to do the work to pay for this person I can go ahead and hire anybody that I want and I can make that I can make the determination to make the money to be able to do it and I become extremely focused in that direction and we do that with companies every day every day and they're just astounded by the idea that they were just psychologically stuck that they couldn't do it because they didn't necessarily have the cash in hand to do it I'm like you don't need to have the cash in the hand you need to make the decision to do it and you need to make the decision that you're going to work in in in your sales to bring the money in to be able to do it. Changes it it really does and it's it's it almost appears as if sometimes by magic and and it isn't magic but there's a magical element to it that when we put our minds to something and we really commit and you know like I'm I'm I'm going to head to the gym here shortly and I nobody hates the gym more than me but all I did was I said look here's the reality I cannot I will not go by myself and I I'm I at the time was 44 years old I'm like I know myself I would love to go to the gym on my own it's not going to happen and there's a little defeatist attitude there but it was very honest I was like look I've been living in this body for 44 years I pretty much know what I motivated to do and not do but is there a solution can I still get fit well I had to go I'm just going to have to do the expensive option and hire a trainer and I thought I can't afford it it's it and it is an incredible amount of money and yet here I am two years later it's not that my income has dramatically shifted where I just now have so much money that I can hire trainers no I I did it even when I really couldn't afford it and sure enough the money showed up it just kept showing up it's not like you know it's it's not it showed enough showed up where I could continue to do that and here I am now two years later and it and I all I did was change my attitude I just went I'm going to have to pay for this I'm going to have to figure out a way to pay for this or else I'm not going to be healthy and and it was really that simple and you're absolutely right like I never thought I could afford to pay for that and somehow I did yeah yeah it's a it's a it's a very interesting dynamic with human beings when we are split focused on something all we do is see the confusion and the reasons that we can't when we make a decision we really focus in on what it is that we need and we have to understand something we're programmed to manifest what we need we will always get what we need but people aren't consciously aware of that will you become consciously aware of that everything in your life changes because you're like holy crap I had no idea that this would actually work if I if I did it but you have to be willing to try it in in order to be able to do it you got to step into those decisions to do it it I mean it completely changed my life and I got the first semblance of that when I made the decision to change my attitude and all of a sudden everything in my life changed because of it I'm like wait a minute what what thing matrix did I just walk through this isn't supposed to happen to a 17 year old dropout like it's not I'm not supposed to triple my income in a month but then you get and so that from there I went to from 50,000 a year to 50,000 a month and then over a million and then beyond that and it was like did it it just kept getting better but I kept doing the same principles that I was learning along the way and it's everybody else around me could not even begin to understand how this could even be possible except for the people that have gone before you of course who know it and and they look at you and go oh he's one of us he gets it and and and the good news too about pretty much every local community you know whether you live in rural Montana or Iowa or you're in a major city like you're you're outside of Charlotte I'm here in in Chicago there are people that have done this and and I would encourage you to beg plead with them to to develop a friendship or a relationship or at least take them out to coffee and say tell me about how do you start your day what do you what do you say when you wake up tears you know when you come across a problem or a challenge what are you doing and it's amazing success leaves clues doesn't it I mean people will just not even clues people will just tell you this is what I do yeah yeah and and the higher you go as far as successful people the more information that they'll give you because if you want to help people right I mean I want to help people that's when I learned how to do what I did when I became aware of it I'm like I thought at the time this is the greatest secret on the planet nobody knows that right I found something out I can't believe and and it was very true that many people don't know most people are not raised and that would that kind of a mindset and people will say to me well not you know come on mindset really isn't that like you know ooki gookie or you know and I'm like no it isn't mindset is the way you do anything right it is the way you think about things the way that you learn about things and your mindset is biased to the way that you are raised yeah so that's the only thing that you know but there's things way beyond what you know they can have an amazing impact like you said it's almost like magic on your life if people just don't know it and it might not come in the time frame that you're expecting in fact it likely won't it'll either take longer or shorter so that's also that another challenge is to is to commit to the activity or the discipline and trust that you know the answers will reveal themselves at the right time it just might not be the time that's most convenient for you absolutely tell us about the podcast so we've been talking about it and I want our audience to have a resource where they can go and reset their mind their expectations and again this is not from you know David's not a guy who knows the the sort of you know cool sounding phrases and things to say he actually consults businesses he you know he's worked with multi-billion dollar businesses this is somebody who is paid to get results so so I love that you have a podcast and you're not just a a self-help guy which you know some self-help guys are amazing but I like people that get results in the real world too and so tell us about the successful mind podcast so in in 2017 I was I just I got the idea like I want to try a podcast at that point there were about 500,000 podcasts today there's four million alone in in the United States right that's grown that much yeah so I I started it and I was doing it and me and my partner Steph Tuss what we were having a meeting with Gary Vangerchuk in New York in his office and we were sitting around just kind of shooting a shit with him and we were talking and he was like how's the podcast going and we're telling him and he says to me what what information are you putting out in the podcast right and we had been doing it for about a year at this point and I was telling him and he said is that your best information and I said what do you mean best he's like is that the results driven information that you would give a private client I'm like no and he said I want you to start giving he said I challenge you to start giving that information for free on the podcast and I'm like are you kidding me he's like my secret sauce I can't give that for free yeah so then he says something to me that really kind of changed my my vision on something he's told me he's a David let me ask you a question he said just honest just between us is there anything that you teach that if a person knew what it was they couldn't find it on the internet right and I'm like that's a good point he's like it's the same thing with me he said so they're not paying for the information they're paying for contact right so when you get when you consult somebody they're paying for contact they're paying for strategy they're paying for that but the information itself they could get anywhere they just don't know what it is he said so if you give enough of that information you're going to grow your business and or they don't know who to trust they don't know whose information is accurate and and you can build your brand through a podcast of hey I I am an authority figure here I do actually have real world experience and results let me let me tell you what I do and then you're right even though it maybe you didn't you know create all of your own learning you've learned it through others and through other experience you still can be of incredible value to people even if you give away the secret sauce yes and that's so that's started doing we're like okay I'm gonna give this a try and see what happens our major concern was that it would piss off our private clients that like they get angry because they're going we're paying for this we never had one of them even even say that it wasn't even a thought on their mind but what did happen was that every time that we would do a live event or a seminar or a speaking engagement or something one of the one of the things that we would ask people out of form would be how did you hear about us and almost overnight we started getting tons of people going the podcast the podcast yeah that was our first introduction now it's hard to measure that as you know right I mean because you don't get this much data very little unfortunately very little exactly right it's not like you it's not like your regular marketing campaigns that give you tons of information but you do get the information on the opposite side when you ask people how did you first hear about us and they tell you it's the podcast you know that thing is working and you know I mean we went over two million views in a relatively short period of time without any marketing agenda on our end just putting it out there so it's spread by word of mouth so it's a it's a really great thing and there's a ton of teaching on there and there's also we just started something new me and Steph Tuss she's my CEO of my company and we were currently once a week we're telling stories based on real challenges the companies that we work with have and how we're actually fixing those things for people so so that so we're doing that and people are loving what they're loving it so check it out yeah so everyone I want everyone to consider no I'm not don't consider just subscribe
