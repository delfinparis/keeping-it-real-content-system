[00:02:30] Today, on the show, we have Leah Canfield from Mountain Home Struke with Cold Wall
[00:02:35] Banker Mountain Properties in Breckenridge and all of Summit County in Colorado.
[00:02:41] Let me tell you more about Leah.
[00:02:42] Leah Canfield is a real estate agent in her hometown of Breckenridge, Colorado.
[00:02:47] She grew up ski racing and was at the peak of her career, the fastest junior super
[00:02:53] G skier in the country.

[00:03:14] She loves to ski mountain bike and travel.
[00:03:18] I want you to visit Leah at her group's homepage, which is mountainhomesgroup.com.
[00:03:25] Again, mountainhomesgroup.com.
[00:03:27] That link will be in our show notes.
[00:03:29] Leah, welcome to the show.
[00:03:31] Thank you.
[00:03:32] What an intro.
[00:03:33] Well, I will tell you the intro doesn't even begin to really explain how excited I am because we've done, I think I don't know what number episode this will be some 400, the low 400s.
[00:03:47] And I oftentimes, this is a little embarrassing.
[00:03:50] I sometimes don't get to do the prep for the show until pretty close to the show.
[00:03:54] I have people that help put together notes for me.
[00:03:58] And I was really excited this morning when I got to the office and started reading about you because not only, of course, you know, you have this sort of impressive background with competitive skiing and being an athlete, but also having a tremendous success pretty early on in the business career of being a real state agent.
[00:04:19] And you also gave us some talking points that we're going to get into about grind culture and your thoughts on that.
[00:04:25] So I am really, really excited to chat with you.
[00:04:28] So thank you for coming on the show.
[00:04:30] I don't always get to say that or don't always even feel that sometimes with all of the guests that we have as much as I love our guests.
[00:04:37] This one really speaks to me this topic of grind culture.
[00:04:40] So I would love to start all the way at the beginning of sort of where you entered.
[00:04:47] I'd love to start really at the beginning of competitive skiing and move our way into real estate because I think there's probably some parallels and some disciplines that that translated over.
[00:04:58] But tell us about this.
[00:04:59] How did had you been skiing your entire life starting out very young or did you get into it when you were okay.
[00:05:04] Now, yeah, I started very young, learned skiing. I was two.
[00:05:08] My dad actually a whole different story, but he's an amputee above the knee. He was a big skier and he was a parent, a parent, a parent, a fiance.
[00:05:14] So he really got me into the sport.
[00:05:18] And I ski raised through my whole childhood, through being a young adult.
[00:05:22] I got to travel internationally to ski race, which was very cool.
[00:05:26] I don't think I even realized how cool it was until now.
[00:05:30] And I started to get some really good success.
[00:05:34] But I was one of those people that was always going like 120%.
[00:05:37] So that led to actually quite a bit of injury in my career.
[00:05:40] I had five knee surgeries before I turned 20.
[00:05:43] And that was really, they have quite a long recovery time period.
[00:05:47] So for like five or six years, I was just under the knife and in physical therapy and just always trying to get back into sport and then re-enduring myself.
[00:05:56] So that was where the injuries were the injuries due to like falling or were they like wearing out the cartilage or
[00:06:04] Yeah, it was a little bit of bold. It was some like coming back to sport too soon or too aggressively some certainly crashing.
[00:06:12] Some actually were due, I think to some procedures that in the medical field, they thought we're going to be very successful and actually had a pretty high failure rate.
[00:06:22] So some failed kind of installations of you know ligaments and so forth.
[00:06:27] But yeah, it was it was a lot. So ultimately that was going to be my career path. I had decided for myself.
[00:06:34] Were you were you thinking like were you looking Olympics?
[00:06:37] Was that sort of that was the ball?
[00:06:39] Yeah, yeah, absolutely. Yeah, that was going to be this was my life.
[00:06:42] But I decided, hey, look, this is my body's not designed for this and this is too much.
[00:06:48] I'm not going to get that much in my I quit.
[00:06:49] Yeah, which was tough. But then after that, I wasn't sure what to do. I worked at a coffee shop down, which is still here in breakfast plants for a few years and I was like, OK, I got it.
[00:07:01] I got to do something. I could felt like I had to do something. So I went to a local community college just for like the summer. I went to a few classes.
[00:07:11] Sure.
[00:07:12] How did an economics teacher who said hey, like buy these books, buy these business books.
[00:07:16] So I bought them and my now husband at the time was like, what a waste of money. Like those are going to put you to sleep.
[00:07:22] You're never going to read those.
[00:07:24] I like to tell that story now because they literally changed our lives. We just started our journey into learning about like financial freedom and personal finance and how real estate can have such a huge role in this developing net worth and
[00:07:40] like freedom of your own life really.
[00:07:42] 
[00:07:43] Yeah, all those great topics. So do you mind sharing one or more of those titles just to say if they changed your life, I want to hear about major. They did. And there's so many good ones, but like some of the real basics learning like what an asset is, what a liability is.
[00:07:58] Yeah, for Shadcorded. I read that. I like light bulb.
[00:08:01] You know, some people love that book. Some people hate it. But I felt like it was life changing for me.
[00:08:05] Can I ask you a question about that book? Cause I always want to ask someone.
[00:08:09] Do is a primary residence in asset. I know this is a debatable topic.
[00:08:14] You know, okay.
[00:08:17] I think it depends. I can't just say I don't know because the definition of an asset in my mind and probably from you know, reading verbatim from the book is something that makes you money.
[00:08:27] Right, which this does not only on the day you sell it.
[00:08:32] Exactly.
[00:08:32] You can make you money. Yeah.
[00:08:33] Exactly. And we've taken this approach with our primary residence at least that we decided to build this and build it as an investment.
[00:08:40] But you know, the fact that we didn't sell it after a couple years and we're still living here.
[00:08:44] It's questionable. You know, so it's a lifestyle.
[00:08:47] Maybe someday.
[00:08:48] It's a lifestyle investment. But I will say that we were very intentional about the equity we had in our house, the location, making sure that we were treating it not just as a primary residence, but also as an investment.
[00:09:02] So we had our most one had on when we pursued our home.
[00:09:06] And I think we always kind of will. But it depends.
[00:09:10] The only reason I'm bringing that up is I feel that oftentimes I'll ask REALTORS not so much on the show, but just in my, you know, my day to day, understand.
[00:09:18] And sometimes they've never been asked that question. And I've always thought it's a really important thing to have a position on whether it's yes, it's an asset. No, it's not or it depends.
[00:09:28] And I think it depends.
[00:09:28] Have an answer because there are a lot of people who will be having questions like that. And anyway, so I'm sorry, I don't want to get us in what's an asset.
[00:09:37] Just because you mentioned that I wanted to hear your perspective.
[00:09:40] I would say that it's a really important savings account, especially for people who maybe aren't very actively investing, having equity built in your home is some of the.
[00:09:48] It's the only way for some people that they can actually successfully retire. So if you're not an active investor and you're not having buying, you know, and cash,
[00:09:56] holding invests and properties and building up your 401k or your retirement and sometimes the home is your only real worth in when it comes to networks.
[00:10:04] So I think it's extremely important for a lot of people.
[00:10:07] So anyway, you read, read books like rich dad,
[00:10:12] and how did you decide to get into get into real estate as not just maybe an investor or as somebody who's going to be selling it?
[00:10:20] Yes, so we started on the investment side. I actually then went to see you Boulder got my degree in finance and real estate during which time we started a very small investment company like a few people and bought a little house and fixed it up and rented it out and then sold it and then did that a handful of times.
[00:10:36] And after the first time we bought that house, I was like, we bought this and I have absolutely no idea what just happened. Right.
[00:10:43] You know, I went to school to study this and I'm like, what, you know, so then I realized I need to get my real estate license to learn what I'm doing in order to be a real investor who takes herself seriously.
[00:10:54] So I started and just found my license to support the investment side and then it really grew from there.
[00:11:01] And I realized just how number one, it was much more challenging than I thought it was going to be and number two was more lucrative than I thought it could ever be and more fun.
[00:11:11] So yeah, it grew.
[00:11:13] And how long have you been practicing as a REALTOR?
[00:11:16] It's been almost seven years, so 2015.
[00:11:19] Yeah.
[00:11:20] 
[00:11:20] So you got it. You really got into it pretty quickly after so your ski career sort of came to a conclusion then it was college and then right into sort of investing real estate.
[00:11:34] Yeah.
[00:11:34] Yeah. And being a REALTOR.
[00:11:37] So let's go back seven years only because so seven years doing the quick math on that.
[00:11:44] Okay.
[00:11:44] Yeah.
[00:11:46] Yeah. Yeah.
[00:11:47] 2015ish.
[00:11:47] I was trying to think of what the market conditions were at that time.
[00:11:50] What was it like starting a career in real estate?
[00:11:53] Now, yes, you, you imagine you have some sort of public notoriety being from Breckenridge being being a competitive skier that that's probably been in the newspapers a lot and sort of the, you know, whatever publications people there read.
[00:12:08] So I'm sure you're known to some degree in your community, although there's probably a lot of competitive skiers there too.
[00:12:14] There's some incredible aspects there.
[00:12:16] But did, you know, but making a pivot.
[00:12:18] Oh, I'm sure making a pivot from professional being a professional athlete to then selling a real estate.
[00:12:25] It is a person in their early twenties.
[00:12:28] What was that like?
[00:12:29] I imagine that couldn't have been necessarily an easy thing.
[00:12:32] No, it really wasn't.
[00:12:34] People did don't mean for sure, but they weren't, they knew me as like someone's kid. They knew my parents.
[00:12:39] They knew me because I have done here since I was like mine.
[00:12:43] Right. And so they weren't, you know, when it comes time for them to sell their multi million dollar home, they're not like, yeah, let's hire, let's hire a fun.
[00:12:50] And so that was certainly tough.
[00:12:53] And not only that, but our market is extremely saturated with agents.
[00:12:57] There's like this running joke that, you know, if you've already been our party, they've had people that are real estate agents.
[00:13:03] And so it was highly competitive as well.
[00:13:05] So my initial strategy actually wasn't to go after clientele of local people that I knew because they also already knew it doesn't are more agent, but it's been in a business much longer than me.
[00:13:17] So that wasn't my initial approach.
[00:13:19] I started really focusing on one of our our number one feeder market, which is the Denver Front Range area and working on getting those people as they come into town and stroll mainstream and also making really good connections with the agents that work in Denver that have clients who say, hey, we're thinking about finding something in the mountains.
[00:13:37] So that was my approach and I think that that really helped me get a foothold in the industry instead of, you know, it's another one of those books that I read that's great as the blue ocean strategy.
[00:13:47] I don't know the sweet say that one more time blue ocean.
[00:13:50] Yeah, so the blue ocean and it's just in a nutshell, it's like, you know, you have your red ocean, which is highly competitive.
[00:13:57] You know, I think it's like the local Breckenridge agent is red ocean.
[00:14:02] Competing with the, you know, for the same clients that everyone was competing for and the blue ocean strategy is like, hey, what's the way that you can look at your business a little differently where you have a lot less competition.
[00:14:12] And that was the way that I did that was say, hey, I'm not going to compete for this one client that has, you know, a dozen REALTOR friends.
[00:14:19] I'm going to go after this person who doesn't know anybody in Brecken.
[00:14:22] Yeah, I love that.
[00:14:23] So you made, you made friends with, with REALTORS in the Denver area.
[00:14:27] Yeah, because you don't support the Denver area personally or no, and they don't support Breckenridge.
[00:14:33] So this is, this is, that makes, boy, that makes so much sense.
[00:14:37] Really a great opportunity for any of our listeners who either, you know, live in areas where people buy vacation homes or maybe where they retire to or in the flip side, you have people that are leaving to go elsewhere in Illinois, Florida is,
[00:14:53] is a place where a lot of for tax purposes, people retire for, obviously, the weather and, you know, whatever other reasons, they might go there.
[00:15:00] And so that would be, you know, anyone who's a Florida agent, you should be just calling every REALTOR you know in the country and saying, hey, if they're thinking of moving here.
[00:15:09] So that's very interesting.
[00:15:10] So how, so, so you then you was more about building relationships.
[00:15:15] And you also said something also as, as the people from Denver were coming into town, how were you sort of intercepting?
[00:15:23] Well, so I don't know if all the offices have like a Florida agent, right? So I was working on floor a lot.
[00:15:29] I was at, and we have an office right on Main Street.
[00:15:33] And that was extremely difficult for me because I had to overcome this sense that there was like something wrong with sales people that they were like bad people.
[00:15:40] And I had that somehow ingrained in me that like, if I was going to sell something to someone, I was like doing a bad thing, right?
[00:15:47] So I was not a natural one sales person.
[00:15:50] And so it was very awkward the first few times I interacted with people.
[00:15:53] I like blocked out the person and locked in. They walked out. I was like, what's up?
[00:15:56] And, but you know, everything takes practice. And eventually I got at the confidence to just be personal, be myself and chat with these guys.
[00:16:04] And it also took me acknowledging that, hey, I'm not just like, I'm not trying to take advantage of someone trying to, you know, help them because I am and a resource for them.
[00:16:13] So once I kind of shifted my mindset that a sales person is not like a parasite, but instead a, you know, a source of wealth of information and, you know, a friend, someone who can help you with something that you need.
[00:16:28] Once I made that shift, it was a lot easier for me.
[00:16:30] Yeah, I, I, I so agree with that. And for anyone out there who's struggling with what Leo was talking about, this idea of, I'm bothering people.
[00:16:39] They don't want to talk to me. They think I'm gross because I'm a sales person and nobody likes sales people and all of that.
[00:16:46] Yes, there's truth in all of that, of course.
[00:16:49] But if you're not a gross, um, slimy sales person, you don't have to worry about coming off the slimy and gross.
[00:16:57] It's what I say to guys all the time who go, I wonder if that girl thinks I'm a creep. I'm like, are you a creep? If you're not, you don't, you can go ask her out.
[00:17:05] It's okay because if you're not a creep, you don't have to worry about being perceived as creepy and the same thing to sales people.
[00:17:11] If you're not a horrible human being, then you can go ahead and talk to people who by the way, 99% chance they're going to use a REALTOR anyway.
[00:17:21] So this isn't even something like, hey, you really need to get into this bizarre insurance that you don't even know about, but I'm going to try to convince you you need, which by the way is a perfectly fine industry as well.
[00:17:32] I love insurance agents, but that's a much tougher sale sometimes because it's selling things that people don't even know they need.
[00:17:38] But in your case, they're going to use a REALTOR. So I just wanted to really honor you for saying that because I think it's so easy to forget that everybody's when they, everybody starts out in this business, it's, it's, it's a little nerve wracking to have your first open house to sit.
[00:17:53] And I love the fact that you live in an area where people still walk into offices that is not as common in the country, but it's a little bit of a trial by fire because they're coming in.
[00:18:05] And or, you know, they're walking by and you're not having to strike up a conversation.
[00:18:09] Yeah, or at the end of it, I would be walking out on to Main Street, like, hey, what are you looking at in this window? Let's talk about it.
[00:18:16] So yeah, took a little confidence boost.
[00:18:19] I love that. So, so you really jumped in and again, you're still a young person, but I guess I guess it to make sense because you talked about everybody in town knows me as, you know, I'm a skier.
[00:18:32] I'm, I'm my father's daughter. I am, you know, I'm a kid, you know, and I'm a kid in my early 20s. I'm an adult technically, but people in town maybe not only do they maybe see me a certain way they also have, you know, a handful of other agents that maybe their best friends with who are probably going to get the listings, you know, above you just because that's how things work.
[00:18:53] So let's talk about it. So you started working at, you know, in the office and, and, you know, dealing with floor time and sort of trial by fire, I sort of would say is having direct one on one conversations.
[00:19:06] And then how did you grow from there?
[00:19:09] Yeah, so, you know, I started pretty early on coming up with a business plan. And I think that those two words together caused people some lot of anxiety.
[00:19:19] But I don't remember who said this might have been mark you, but he's like, hey, if you can't come up with a business plan in the amount of time that it takes you to drink the can of soda like you're doing it wrong.
[00:19:27] And that stuck with me because it was like, okay, don't overcomplicate it. I get a small piece of paper or a post it note or whatever.
[00:19:35] And I write down what I want to do in sales, you know, how does that translate? What's my average sales price? What do I think is attainable? How many sales is that?
[00:19:42] How many appointments do I need to do? Do I need to make? And then I also did some really crude math of approximately how many people do I think I need my database?
[00:19:51] Sure.
[00:19:52] I went to a ninja class. I think they said something like, you know, every person your database translates to something like $10,000 of income or something something along those lines might be misquoting.
[00:20:02] But I said, look, I need to start building my database like nobody I need to start putting my name. We can't feel next to luxury real estate in as many instances I can.
[00:20:12] So I started putting more and more people in my database and coming up with a plan that they saw my face and heard my name next to real estate.
[00:20:19] I also started doing some like something I learned from Barbara Corcoran, which is reach out to your local newspaper like these these people are just usually young and hungry and overworked and have to come up with content for the newspaper and they don't know like they have to do it every single day.
[00:20:40] And so if you help them and say, hey, look, this is super interesting. This is happening in our market nine times out of 10. They're going to call you back and say, hey, can you explain us to me? And can I quote you on this? And then all of a sudden, your name is in the newspaper next to luxury real estate or whatever you decide.
[00:20:54] That's really. I'm going to pause you. That is incredibly interesting. Nobody has ever ever made that suggestion on this podcast. So super exclusive for us.
[00:21:04] So I want to I want to just just unwind that a little bit so that our audience really hits. I thought you were going to go a different way with it, which is I do have this kind of cool story about my background as a you know a junior skier who was you know headed to to Olympics and now I've pivoted because of injuries.
[00:21:23] And like that's a very interesting story just in and of itself that a newspaper might be interested in, but that's a one off. And so I thought we were going to say, well, I just wanted to sort of trade in a little bit on my notoriety and get some publicity, which that would have made all the sense in the world to me too.
[00:21:39] But you actually went a totally different way. I want their reporters to call me when they need a quote or they need help with definitions or that is beyond brilliant because you're absolutely right.
[00:21:54] These are people that work on incredible deadlines. They're underworked. They are certain they're overworked and underpaid. Yeah, sorry. There are very overworked and underpaid and it's a stressful position.
[00:22:05] And you can help actually make their lives a little easier. And so people say that the reporter started using you in stories, I guess.
[00:22:13] Yeah, yeah. And I still try at least once a month to send them something interesting that's happening because I pull data for my news, whatever month I'm looking at, you know, what's happening this month in our market, what are some you know sales that are very interesting or what you know we've seen some really crazy stuff in our market, right?
[00:22:29] Like sure 200% appreciation of this and you know, that's a great new story. Yeah, right. And it's a headline. So anytime I see something that I'm like, this would be a good headline. I send it.
[00:22:40] So how often how often do they end up using your your ideas? I'm just 70% of the time, you know, everyone's like, oh my gosh, but most of the time they're like, they call me back to might be two weeks or three weeks later. And they're like, hey, just circling back to this.
[00:22:56] Can you tell me more about that? And then it ends up, yeah.
[00:23:00] That is that is so incredibly smart. I, I'm a little bit sort of gobsmacked with that. I really apps, which is a great word that I'm just starting to incorporate more into my, it's one of those words that sort of makes you seem smarter than saying I'm stunned.
[00:23:15] But, but I am, I am gobsmacked and or stunned because that is an absolutely brilliant strategy. So thank you for that. So okay, started. Yeah. So you started doing that that helped. I imagine get your name out there.
[00:23:29] It did get helped with more of my like my sometimes my older clientele. Maybe I would get a referral to someone who wanted to sell. And they're like, wait, keep seeing your name in the newspaper. And so that gives you credibility.
[00:23:41] So my struggle was credibility, right? I was maybe they knew my parents, you know, maybe they knew that I grew up here. But they certainly didn't trust me to sell their luxury home. And so I had to kind of chip away at that credibility.
[00:23:54] And my goal is when someone thinks of love at a real estate, they think of me.
[00:23:59] So anytime I could put my name next to luxury real estate in people's minds, then that's the win.
[00:24:06] Really, what it really all what what you what you could really do for those of us thinking, well, what kind of stories. I mean, you literally just can look at data and the MLS.
[00:24:16] I mean, it really interesting statistic that is like a little shocking even you send that over go guys. I have an idea for you.
[00:24:23] Yeah. And don't you don't give them too much. I mean, like I said, these guys are overworked. Don't put more than five sentences in your email, right? Give them a give them a clip, give them a taste and see if they're interested. They'll call you.
[00:24:34] Love it. Yeah. So yeah, I did that. I started.
[00:24:40] I also realized pretty early on that I was very interested in new construction and developments.
[00:24:50] And I learned that when a town or a county wants to hire a contractor, they have to go through a very transparent process because the last thing I'm municipality wants to be accused of is, you know, like taking kickbacks and hiring their friends for a job.
[00:25:07] And so when a town wants to hire a real estate agent to sell a town built project, they have to go through an RFP request for proposal process.
[00:25:18] And I learned about this pretty early on in my career, like in a year and a half and maybe.
[00:25:24] And had a friend, he just got her license and we were like, should we put a proposal in for this project. We're a total long shot, but it was for a local project is still pretty big. It's 25 million dollar project.
[00:25:36] And we ended up winning the bid because people felt we just went in and created a very professional looking proposal. We took it very seriously and they felt that we would be a good face for the project. We got it.
[00:25:49] So that is also something that's interesting for people to know is that oftentimes you're like towns and counties have are doing some of their own real estate development because in so many areas, there's a lack of.
[00:26:02] And so if you're a job employee or local housing and they're trying to address up themselves, anyone can apply for those for those sales jobs. So that's how I really got started in the development world and that I learned a ton doing that project.
[00:26:15] And it was a really great experience. And then I faced kind of another challenge after that, which was okay. Now people kind of know me as the like employee housing person. How do I pivot and become.
[00:26:26] You know, luxury salesperson, which is more of the area that I was interested in at the time.
[00:26:31] And so I just kept kept doing what I was talking about earlier, which is, hey, put my name next to lugger real estate. We're sending a newsletter. We have luxury listings in there.
[00:26:40] Right. We made comments. We're talking about the luxury market because that's really one of me. You kind of like manifest your your goals that way.
[00:26:48] Yeah, that it makes sense is you you you really I think what we're really talking about is branding. It sounds like you you very, very early on, you know, sort of developed your brand.
[00:27:00] You were clear about what you wanted your brand to represent. And yes, you're not going to turn down a $25 million development deal from a local municipality. Simply because it doesn't necessarily fit the the brand, you know, I deal.
[00:27:14] But it's a great opportunity, a great learning experience and how awesome to be chosen. So you're going to do that. And then you're going to you're going to still return to your north star, which is luxury.
[00:27:24] Yeah, yeah, your stars is and I want to mention to that a lot of times agents. I'm curious to get your thoughts on this. And you see this as well with other agents. I'm sure in your market is a lot of times the way agents think about branding is it's all about the visual.
[00:27:39] So they're doing a lot on social Instagram Facebook. There's a lot of, you know, but you don't really that's not really your path.
[00:27:49] Now that's a very that's a very unique way. So talk about is is social a part of your marketing strategy or I'm just curious what the importance of it is.
[00:27:59] Yeah, I think it's more important than we give it credit for we could certainly improve on it. We're always talking about it and everyone. I've since built a team which we can talk about, but everyone on my team is like, we need to do better at this. So certainly, like anyone, we're not perfect and social media is one of those things that we can really improve on, but we, you know, you don't have to be good at everything. You have to do everything.
[00:28:22] You're just going to be great to be great. You just have to be great at a few things. And so I think we're kind of leaning into the things that we're really good at and it kind of makes up for some of our things that we're not so great at, which is like social media.
[00:28:36] But I'm not saying that to identify something that's that's you're not strong and I was and I hope hopefully you didn't get that impression.
[00:28:43] I'm not sure if that's like that. No.
[00:28:44] Good because I really was saying it as as a huge differentiator that that that obviously you could always, you know, get good at social if you want to, but that's not how you built your luxury brand.
[00:28:56] And you really sort of avoided that, which again, you could have traded in a lot of your previous success as a skier as you could have really leaned into some of these accolades that you've, you've received and and made that a big push on social, but you didn't do that.
[00:29:15] And I think that's particularly interesting.
[00:29:17] And I think again, it, it sort of creates a more of a red ocean opportunity for you to find other, find other.
[00:29:24] Yeah, yeah, red ocean.
[00:29:26] Yeah, we have. So yeah, I think branding can be very simple. Honestly, for me, like I said, my, my mountain decline was the credibility mountain, right, because I was young.
[00:29:36] I was a girl.
[00:29:38] A lot of people knew me as someone's kid. So I had to, I had to convince people that I was legit.
[00:29:41] Something I actually haven't really told anyone, which is that when I first started, I didn't ever sent, I had was like going towards some investment because we were so into investing.
[00:29:52] And so I didn't really ever save up to like, buy a nice car.
[00:29:55] So I drove this kind of beat up little Subaru. And I certainly couldn't, you know, with a straight face, bring a luxury client into it and tour them on these luxury homes.
[00:30:04] So I, my parents, I live in Bracken region. And anytime I would have a client or a walk and I'd tell my mom who drove a Lexus. And I was like, can I use your likes and choose the best mom ever. She's like, yes, you can.
[00:30:15] And so I'm coming right down to just like how, how you present your not, I'm not trying to say that anyone who wants to become a luxury REALTOR needs to drive a Lexus or a luxury car.
[00:30:24] But, but presenting yourself in the most professional way that you can, anytime you can, the way that you dress, the way that you speak, the, you know, how we arrive, all of that makes an impact and all of that does attribute to your branding.
[00:30:38] It's not just who you are online because even though social media has exploded so much, I'm still in the generation where I was here before, you know, the internet.
[00:30:51] And, and your brand really is who you are when you're standing in front of your client.
[00:30:57] And so how can you be the person that you want to be in, you know, if you want to be a luxury real estate agent, what does that look like? And if you have to fake it and say, make it the time to drive your mom Lexus around or your friend, you know, you pay your friend.
[00:31:12] 50 bucks every time she lends you her BMW because you drive a beat up Subaru do it, you know, find ways that you can present yourself as the brand you want to be and that helped me as well with even it also helps with confidence, you know, dress to impress you feel, you feel more confident.
[00:31:30] So yeah, yeah, I agree that's I think that's that's really really great advice.
[00:31:35] And so, let's talk about grind culture because before we get into this, I want to hear you're more you are firmly in the anti grind culture camp.
[00:31:48] And I love that because so often we hear about outworking our competition, working more hours, especially in real estate, where so much happens outside of the traditional business hours.
[00:32:02] Yeah, you know, our listeners are getting text messages, voice mails, you know, all sorts of things late into the evening boundaries are hard to set their hard to follow it's also an unstructured job from the REALTOR side so it's it's tough.
[00:32:19] And it's easy to just keep going and going and going because the text thread really never ends until they get the keys.
[00:32:26] And then until you forget to respond until you forget to respond.
[00:32:31] Yeah, yeah, and that's yeah, so let's talk about that let's talk about grind culture and and what what why you've taken sort of a stance against it.
[00:32:40] Okay, so I live in Brecknerage, I love the listeners are familiar, but it's a gorgeous mountain town in Colorado, no first skiing biking outdoor activities.
[00:32:49] And when I first started in real estate, I, I was a one one woman show as most people are, and I really wanted to be successful and I'm a competitive person, right.
[00:33:00] So I threw everything at it just like I did with with ski racing and I remember we we went on this vacation, my now husband and I and I just worked the entire time.
[00:33:13] And we were at the beach and I was on my computer when I was going back to the room and I was like calls and I was and I was just I was just running and I was on vacation and I came back and I was like that was not a vacation.
[00:33:23] That was that was relaxing at all, you know, and then I also really realized I just did a little bit of reflection and said like what do I really want my life to look like because I only get one life and there's no point in living a life that I'm not excited about because like there's no take backs, right.
[00:33:39] And so I live here in this gorgeous place because I love to go skiing, I love to go mountain biking, I love to go for hikes, I love to be outside and I can't do all of that if I'm on all the time.
[00:33:51] And so I decided that this job, you know, there's multiple things can be true at the same time.
[00:33:57] Yes.
[00:33:58] Number one, I want to provide a really high level of service to my clients, right.
[00:34:03] Number two, I'm not perfect.
[00:34:06] I one of my very first deals, I like completely dropped the ball on this thing and I was like, oh my gosh, what am I doing ice.
[00:34:13] Look at this.
[00:34:14] And it helped me realize that I.
[00:34:19] The person who's going to do everything at all times, otherwise my life is not going to be what I want it to be.
[00:34:27] And so we should we should mention that some people can somehow eat that out. Some people can seemingly do.
[00:34:34] Some people are designed for that.
[00:34:35] Some people are designed for it.
[00:34:37] I think the majority of us probably I'm not either.
[00:34:40] And so and I, you know, when I'm out on a mountain bike ride and I get a call from a client, I want to be able to help them, but I also don't want to take the call because I'm on a mountain bike ride.
[00:34:49] And that's my time to, you know, clear my head.
[00:34:52] And so what I settled on was I need help and I will plug another book that changed my life called the e-mix.
[00:35:00] Oh, sure.
[00:35:00] Yeah, the entrepreneurship myth. I recommend if you haven't read it every real church of read it.
[00:35:05] It's about the importance of building a business like a real business and recognizing what roles you play.
[00:35:12] Because if you are one man show, you are the CEO, you are the, you know, COO, you're all the whole executive suite.
[00:35:20] You're also the receptionist and you're you're you're the marketing customer service.
[00:35:25] You're the social media.
[00:35:26] Sales team.
[00:35:27] Right. So write it down. Say like, Hey, I'm all these people. Am I good at all plus am I a good receptionist or am I bad at answering the phone.
[00:35:36] If I'm bad at answering the phone or if I don't like it, then hire someone to help you with it.
[00:35:41] And so going back to that project that we did with the town of Breck, that that project having that almost like guaranteed future income of that development gave me the confidence to bring on my first assistant.
[00:35:52] And that was a game changer because I realized that I can provide the level of service that I want to my clients while also enjoying my life.
[00:36:01] And not only that, I could provide a better level of service to my clients than if I was just grinding it up alone because I started.
[00:36:09] I think a lot of real terms become a victim of their own success. They're like, OK, if only I can reach this sales number.
[00:36:15] If only I could have a few more contracts or a few more clients and then they get there and they're like, whoa, I've got 10 things under contract fully mully and they're like going crazy.
[00:36:24] And then they're like, I don't have time to put together a monthly newsletter this month.
[00:36:27] Like I have 10 contracts, right? I don't have time to prospect. I don't have time to send these whatever the mailers, whatever your strategy is.
[00:36:34] And so they start dropping the ball and the things that are not urgent because you have to you're not going to drop the ball on your contract, right?
[00:36:41] Hopefully. And so having that assistant having a team built around you helps so that when you do get busy, your monthly newsletter still goes out on the first of the month.
[00:36:52] Right. And you can have a more consistent, reliable level of service to your clients because you have built a system and you understood that, hey, I cannot do it all by myself.
[00:37:04] And I'm actually I'm doing a disservice to my client trying to do everything myself because I also get sick and I also get burnt out in my awesome competition.
[00:37:13] Well, and that that probably is a lesson. A lot of a lot of that you probably learned as a teenager being a competitive, you know, supergie scare because you you you can pardon the pun, get to the top of the mountain and be on that Olympic team or even win, win, you know, whatever event of the Olympics you were going for.
[00:37:33] And then you can I mean all of those are possible. They certainly were possible in your life. And yet, how happy, you know, the happiness that you're that that you're sort of wanting or the fulfillment you're wanting may come at a significant cost because the level of sort of output that that requires to get to the top of the mountain as a singular person is, well, you know, it's incredible amount of demand on your body on your mind on your time.
[00:38:01] And so I have a question about texting a very specific question. So you were talking about, you know, you get the phone call your mountain biking. Now you're like, okay, assistance going to grab that I get it. You'll you'll have that routed to the assistant. What about text messages.
[00:38:16] Yeah, text messages are tough. They are really tough. I would say that if it's something that I either don't have the mental space for or I have something else going on right now, I will just screen grab that and send it to my.
[00:38:31] Send it to my assistant and say can you help me with this or you know, I'll say, hey, my this, this person reached out to me about this. Can you help me because and I like to recognize it. I've learned at the beginning of the correspondence because if you're really busy and you start communicating with me, you know,
[00:38:45] you're talking with your client and then you train loop someone in, then they're like, no, I'm talking to you about this. But if they start asking you about something right away and you can say, you know, you loop someone in immediately, then that person is the point person.
[00:39:00] So I don't have a perfect answer. Texting is really tricky and I would be lying if I said that, you know, I haven't forgotten about a text and woken up in the middle of the night like, oh, never responded to that text, right.
[00:39:10] But I do love that the new iPhone, I think you can like mark them as unread. I don't have the newest iPhones. I'm excited to get that so that I can like if I open up a text and I'm not prepared to deal with it, I can mark it as unread and treat it more like a.
[00:39:23] You know, I want to pause for a moment to talk about our episode sponsor are one of my favorite companies out there follow up boss now after interviewing hundreds of top REALTORS in the country for the podcast.

[00:40:45] But but that I think that's helpful because it also to we know when you start communicating you're setting via tax you're also setting in motion like a response time that now there's an expectation there and do you do set sort of clear boundaries around.
[00:41:03] I do my I do my own way not I don't do it up front i'm not like hey these are my business always some people who thought I really will stop that but I do it sometimes you meet you have a client or you meet someone who you kind of can tell is like a pusher you know they're going to kind of push you and push you to kind of see what your limit is and when I have a client or someone like that I I make an effort to not respond like it let's say someone who I'm not going to do it.
[00:41:31] Who's who's that personality type text me I have a client i'll just give you a little I have a client who I showed them a property.
[00:41:38] Followed up with them they kind of go sit me for like a week and then a week later I like 10 feet up they texted me and they were like hey we're ready for an offer if we could you know my husband has.
[00:41:49] work in the morning but if you could have it ready you know before he leaves for work then we can.
[00:41:54] I was like you know what i'm not responding to this because that is in my way how i'm going to set my boundaries and if I don't respond to this it's not going to set a precedent that for the whole contract period i'm available to be work for you during the night hours.
[00:42:06] Right because you're in a position when that text comes in you're in a position to either defend why you can't do it.
[00:42:12] Yeah which is a Louis situation or or you're going to grind it out and try to get it done at the cost of sleep and energy and other things and.
[00:42:21] I know now also reinforcing their behavior yeah now they're going they're going to it's not like they're magically going to snap to.
[00:42:28] Oh going forward we're going to you know not text you pass five o'clock know you just told them it's perfectly okay what you just did.
[00:42:35] So yes that's you're exactly right I don't want to reinforce that behavior and and there's with some clients in certain instances you know i've a client who's a.
[00:42:42] A surgeon and his hours are super tough and you wanted to have a call to be like 8 30 and it's like okay I get it and I can tell he's not that personality he's going to start calling me.
[00:42:51] I'm not a 30 so I feel like I can read people and I don't set exact hours I respect the people who do but I think that it's important before you you know if you don't feel like you want to respond to someone because of the time of day or because of.
[00:43:08] You know mostly it's a time of day time right if you're on vacation hopefully you have coverage from someone but if it's in the middle of the night thing don't do it if it's that person who's going to just keep.
[00:43:19] Because sometimes you work with these clients for like years if they don't find anything or they get to other house and so then all of a sudden it's a lot harder to real back.
[00:43:29] No once you've opened those floodgates of yeah let me get that done for you to let me.
[00:43:33] I um I I agree wholeheartedly I I just think it's such a it's it's a conversation I like to have because.
[00:43:41] Text communication really is very complicated in sort of what it what it represents in different different parts of the business and so it's something that every agent really needs to think through what's my policy around x y and z and yes when I have the you know the guy who's the surgeon who's who just got out of a 16 hour surgery and and he needs to talk to me at eight o'clock at night I get it he's not trying to push my buttons or push me he's just that's when he's available of course we get that.
[00:44:10] But but we also understand that you know there there's certain ways we can set you know temporary boundaries around yeah around sort of our general behavior.
[00:44:18] I also really and I don't talk about this enough but I think we have a lot of women who come on our show and I oftentimes forget as a guy I don't think as much about this and I should but I want to talk about sort of gut feelings and I know you.
[00:44:34] Tell me a little bit about the importance of trusting your gut i mean I imagine as an athlete you have to know you know you have to listen to signals to be a competitive athlete but you know I'm curious about sort of gut instinct and how that's you know manifested in your.
[00:44:51] Yeah I'm not a very.
[00:44:57] I would say I'm a more logical person than anything else I don't know if they call it left brained I'm more logical.
[00:45:03] And so it's easy for me and I think people like me to dismiss certain feelings that they have because they're different than our contradictory maybe it's the logic yeah like hey this client is prepared to spend 10 million dollars and then you're you're feeling is like walk away right but your head is like let me have that commission before I've earned it right.
[00:45:23] And so sometimes when you have those conflicting feelings it can be tough especially if you're more of a logical person because you can dismiss these feelings that's just that right people have feelings.
[00:45:32] Because the facts the facts aren't in yet but the facts say everything looks okay but something inside of me that's more intangible and invisible is giving me pause and my logical brain is going shut up other part of you you don't you don't have any facts this is just you know whatever you're getting scared or whatever might be.
[00:45:53] And so the and by the way this is this happens all the time so I'm so glad we're talking about go ahead I'm sorry.
[00:45:59] Yeah no that's that's good so I think there's a lot of us not to get into biology but there's a lot of the human body that I think we don't totally understand most about the least.
[00:46:09] And we are hardwired with certain instincts right for eating and resting and yeah for all sorts of things that have helped protect us over however many.
[00:46:20] Um however long in history we've been a species right and so I think once I recognize that hey sometimes I got feeling is a culmination of various instincts that my body has those are legitimate actually those are just as legitimate as as you know my logical part of my brain potentially even more more so because they're older they're older and they're bypassing consciousness which consciousness.
[00:46:48] Consciousness can steer us wrong right as consciousness can tell us you know things are not the way they appear because we are imperfect our brains are imperfect instincts however 10 10 to once you're able to identify what an instinct is and and what and the difference between instinct and you know maybe.
[00:47:08] Things you know fears and things that might be getting the way yeah so I'm sorry I don't mean to.
[00:47:14] No yeah you're right you're right they're there they're to protect you your instincts are there to protect you for the most part so listen to them um you know being.
[00:47:22] Being a woman in the business I think maybe comes at a little bit higher risk um I don't generally really ever feel unsafe in the business but I have that instances where um it's become clear to me after working with a client that they're they're really trying to just fun time with me um and not they're not a real client um and either with one instance in particular whether or not.
[00:47:44] That happened I was working with someone for a lot of selling season and ended up putting it in an offer on something and and uh you know I referred him to some local unders that he could call and one of the lenders called me and he's like this guy has no has nothing right in the whole time he's of course hyping himself up like um you know I just saw this business I have all this money I believe houses and and so there's a lot that I learned from that because you know the lenders like doesn't have money for down payment doesn't have a job can't get alone no assets no one's going to loan him anything and I realized.
[00:48:15] Over the years I realized that people with real wealth first of all don't want it like that the people who do that's an immediate roadblocks and you know people who will come in the office and they start talking about how rich and successful they are there's very few of those people who actually have the means to become a real client of yours um and and maybe that's just our market I know different parts different areas are different right have different people but in our laid back mountain market the people who can afford a five million dollar house aren't aren't talking to you about their net worth.
[00:48:44] You know in the first conversation you hop with them and how the house is successful they are.
[00:48:48] So anyways it turns out this guy that I was working with had like a criminal history and I should have been a background check on him and um certainly had no means to buy a house and I had that that feeling right at the beginning and I didn't listen to it and so I said look I'm just gonna I spend a lot of time with this guy um who I think is the best way to do it.
[00:49:08] Yeah it's hard to exit something like that because because it could it could affect your reputation meaning yeah it could go online and scorched earth this REALTOR dropped me as a client I was a serious buyer blah blah blah they they you know men do weird things when women when they feel rejected.
[00:49:27] Yeah yeah so I was you know I ultimately did have to drop him because he came back and wanted to work me again and I thought you know we need to get through fall by this time he's like well you don't trust me you don't believe in the money I have.
[00:49:37] When people say you don't trust me as a question you can just not trust them that's yeah so you know a couple of things I learned from that number one we have a really good resource with our MLS um where you can do like three background check some people.
[00:49:50] Oh that's great.
[00:49:51] Yeah and I think a lot of MLS is have that they're working on that so especially if you're gonna be you know we have a lot of remote areas with like no cell service and we're out showing property um you know me and some guy that I met 21 years ago uh so that's something that's key I think
[00:50:07] we're just looking up I could have found this out by doing a Google search on the spy and I just didn't do it and then you know find ways to yes you can ask all of your clients for a pre-qualification letter or a pre-finished prior to looking at homes and I don't think there's anything wrong with that but there's also just another layer of you know I had a bad gut feeling when I met this guy and I just didn't listen to it and and there have been instances since then where I've had a similar feeling and I have listened to it and I've never regretted it.
[00:50:34] Even no matter how much because usually with these clients they're waving you know money in your face which is a first word flag but um you know it's become a lot easier for me as I've become more successful to realize I don't need this you know and it's not just about that sort of instance there's also a lot of people who aren't respectful right or they don't respect you as a professional or the industry um you know I was just in a listening appointment where the guys like look I'm not gonna sugarcoat it I think real estate professionals are overpaid and I think
[00:51:04] it's a the whole thing is a racket and you know blah blah blah and I just you know I'm gonna beat you on that I'm gonna change your mind
[00:51:11] right what are the odds that you're gonna change that person yeah yeah and also I'm not gonna I'm not gonna
[00:51:17] grovel for your business if you think that I um you know my place in the industry is unwanted because I don't
[00:51:25] actually need I don't need this I I can find success working with people who are like me who um see the
[00:51:33] bigger picture and who are respectful you know and and that's also just been a lifestyle decision for me
[00:51:39] as like hey not only do I want to respect my own boundaries of when I when I want to be working and
[00:51:45] when I don't want to be working but I also want to set my own boundaries of like who do I want to
[00:51:49] work it because this is my life you know and and work is a big part of my life and so I would rather
[00:51:55] sell 80% of of what I could sell and just work with good you know honest people and I'm not saying
[00:52:04] you know any to anyone in the luxury field knows that not every client not every luxury
[00:52:08] fine is easy I'm not trying to say hey this guy's gonna be hard let's ditch it because we work with
[00:52:13] our fair share of of difficult clients and I can be difficult myself so we all have our own things
[00:52:18] right but when you get the feeling that someone is um you know not trustworthy or trying to
[00:52:25] lie about who knows what or um just like not a good person you get that feeling I think you should
[00:52:31] listen to it because why spend your time working with bad people question has your gut ever since you
[00:52:40] become a REALTOR has your gut ever steered you wrong no honestly it hasn't and it's been so hard
[00:52:45] for me because that's not my personality to yes your logical yeah oriented look at the data
[00:52:53] uh and and it's so hard because I can't explain you know I can't explain like why you can't walk it
[00:52:59] back and say oh the reason I had that feeling was because uh x y and z it's like no the feeling showed
[00:53:05] up before I was aware of anything yeah and I and I'm still not perfect like I just um I still have
[00:53:11] instances where I have this this gut feeling of like this isn't gonna end well you know maybe I
[00:53:16] should decline this and then I kind of like work work past it and work through it and then sure
[00:53:20] enough my gut was right and I'm like okay so it's not like I have you know just the perfect you know
[00:53:25] instinct that I'm always listening to sometimes I'm like you know that up I should have listened to
[00:53:30] I should have listened to how I felt but um I think that's an important thing that we don't really
[00:53:34] talk about enough it just in general is that it's listen listen to how you feel because also if
[00:53:42] if for nothing less than when when someone calls you if you immediately get a
[00:53:47] pay in your stomach I mean you're gonna get a pay in your stomach every single time you need to talk
[00:53:51] to this person and you need to you need to figure out whether or not you want to live with a
[00:53:56] pay in your stomach because that's not a way to live right so try and find a way try and find a way
[00:54:02] to to be at peace with the people that you work with and um it's okay to say no sometimes you know
[00:54:11] so as you've stepped away from sort of grinding it out which I imagine you know as the
[00:54:16] at the athlete part of you understands grinding it out and that's how you achieve and it really is
[00:54:22] you know in many ways such a significant part of an athlete's life yeah sort of dropping that and
[00:54:28] trusting that that you can still progress and achieve and scale the mountain without necessarily
[00:54:35] burning you know the candle at both ends what does your life look like now is it more balanced um
[00:54:41] you know and how are you able to still achieve more which you know you're still in the early
[00:54:47] early phase of your real estate career where you're doing more and more and more and obviously
[00:54:51] you know this year's kind of you know a different year for most REALTORS but you're still
[00:54:56] moving forward and achieving how do you do that while maintaining balance what what does that look
[00:55:02] like for you yeah um well so so I will kind of like there's this I'll mention this adage that I
[00:55:09] have heard that I really appreciate I think it's an old African adage hopefully I'm not misquoting it
[00:55:14] but um it says if you want to go fast go alone and if you want to go far go as a team and I think
[00:55:22] that they meant it very literally like if you need to get somewhere fast you better start running by
[00:55:27] yourself and if you need to cross a great distance you better go with the people um and I
[00:55:34] I really like that saying because I I am kind of alone wolf in my by nature um like I only did
[00:55:42] I didn't do team sports I did individual sports right and I was extremely competitive as an
[00:55:47] individual and um I burnt myself out and was plagued with injury and the thing that meant most to
[00:55:54] me at that time which was experiencing and I did I did get to a pretty high level but I I didn't
[00:56:04] I think um and so I realized that you know I should take something away from that which is
[00:56:12] life hopefully for for most of us is quite long and if you want to have success in in something
[00:56:20] and you want to have elongated success then it's important that you work with a team whatever
[00:56:25] that looks like for you I'm not saying every single person needs to start a real estate team
[00:56:29] but it's important that you recognize the going out of the loan it's it's tough to you know it's
[00:56:35] tough to do stuff alone so if that just means you have a support group or a group of agents that
[00:56:38] you meet with to like you know talk to about your your highs and lows together whatever that may be
[00:56:44] so um that that wasn't really the answer to your question so to answer your question what my life
[00:56:48] head looks like now is uh it's certainly and my business it's not perfect there's always things where
[00:56:54] I'm like oh I need to improve on this or we should be doing this and um and so it's I think
[00:56:59] it's always going to be like that though so I've just kind of I become comfortable with that feeling
[00:57:06] of this is not perfect and I don't love that a little bit of a perfectionist so but that's okay
[00:57:11] right I'm I'm I have to tell myself it's okay to get my business is not perfect because it's
[00:57:17] improving and well you said something at the beginning that um probably skated by a lot of us
[00:57:24] but you said two things can be true right and and that's yeah that's I think that's called like
[00:57:28] dialectical thinking this idea of yeah uh two things that could be in opposition can also be true
[00:57:34] right we all know if we have a romantic partner we can love that person with all our heart and
[00:57:40] really be annoyed at something they did at the exact same time yeah and and letting one of those
[00:57:45] emotions totally take over is probably not not the healthiest thing is understanding yes there's
[00:57:51] times I'm annoyed with you and there's times I love you more than anything and all of those can be
[00:57:55] true at the exact moment um yeah and so a life can be out of balance and by the way I don't think
[00:58:01] balance I'm not even sure balance is possible but the striving to sort of balance is is very you
[00:58:07] know important and this idea that you can be uh because you are good at things and also not good at
[00:58:14] things simultaneously right like you were saying yeah right so so yeah I would agree I think
[00:58:20] finding um I think I've heard of it maybe it's called like a false dichotomy where it's like well
[00:58:24] it has to be this or that right that I have to either enjoy my life or have a successful career
[00:58:28] and I can't be happy until yeah right right right I can either um enjoy my life or I can save all
[00:58:37] money writing it's like well you can do both right so I think I think it's extremely important for
[00:58:42] people in our profession they take their real estate class if you're new in the industry or if
[00:58:46] you've been doing it forever um there's no like you said earlier it's not really defined you know
[00:58:51] no one gives you like a manual and says here's your job description they're like hey go good luck
[00:58:56] you know sell stuff because that's how you get paid so um it's really important to have the headspace
[00:59:04] to be able to be a little bit introspective and figure out what you want your life to look like
[00:59:09] because it's one of the best careers in the world to be able to design your own life around it
[00:59:14] you could say hey look I'm I don't really feel that competitive I only really want to sell
[00:59:20] enough to pay my rent and go surfing every day and you can do that right or you can say like hey
[00:59:27] I want to become the top agent in this market you know let's start coming up with some ways
[00:59:32] that you can do that and also go on for vacations here or hold whatever you want to do because
[00:59:39] the most successful people aren't going out of the lung you know the most successful businesses
[00:59:45] aren't one person and every single one of us runs a business so I think we're just I think that
[00:59:51] the grind you know grind to you die lifestyle it doesn't take that into consideration that
[01:00:00] you're you're cutting yourself short and you're doing a disservice to your clients because
[01:00:06] you really can't like we are human we have to sleep right and we have to take a rest and if we
[01:00:14] really want to develop a good business we need to sometimes take days off so that we can have a
[01:00:19] creative thought so that we're not just like when learned is money deadline when okay did I
[01:00:23] review that title commitment and I gotta gotta get to this appointment because if your if your
[01:00:27] mind is constantly on to do lists you can't operate in a creative space that way you can't come up
[01:00:33] with new ways to to do things better than other people so you know give yourself some space headspace
[01:00:42] by taking a few things off your plate so you're not just like running around like a chicken with
[01:00:47] her head cut off and you can actually have an original thought like this is something no one else
[01:00:54] in my market is doing what if we did that right and I think that's only possible if you if you can get
[01:01:01] some help and make and make space right and getting help oftentimes makes that space as as you
[01:01:07] were saying and and you know too for those of us listening who are solo practitioners who are
[01:01:12] thinking well I can't afford to hire you know a an assistant well there as you know there are
[01:01:18] websites where you can post jobs that all over the world people will bid for your business and they
[01:01:23] don't have to live in your immediate market for for certain tasks and there's you know there's
[01:01:28] lots of things that these are can be highly skilled people that live in in areas where the
[01:01:34] compensation is much different than it is here and oftentimes much lower and you're offering them
[01:01:40] an opportunity to make a good living for them and also get the help that you need where maybe you
[01:01:46] can afford to to get a full-time you know local assistant right away and yeah there's a lot of
[01:01:52] there's a lot of creative solutions like that I mean you can if you live there a college
[01:01:56] people need to intern and they don't they don't necessarily even need to be paid right and or if
[01:02:02] you have a group of agents in your office and you guys don't even work together but you're like hey
[01:02:06] I can't afford someone salary but I could afford one fifth of someone salary but about you right so
[01:02:13] there's a lot of different ways you can accomplish this but I I do think that if you're going to take
[01:02:17] your business seriously you know and and you pick up the email and you read it and you realize
[01:02:23] that you're both the CEO and the receptionist of your business everything in between
[01:02:28] there's a better way yeah better for your life too and I just want to circle back and
[01:02:33] this last thing I'll mention because I think it's really important and you said this and it's
[01:02:37] quite profound um this idea of making space for ideas to emerge so you're talking about it reminded
[01:02:44] me of of the saying which is technically it's not even a saying it's it's just true is that
[01:02:51] music that that we enjoy it it's not actually the notes that that are that we're sort of
[01:02:56] interpreting we're actually interpreting the silence between the notes because otherwise it's
[01:03:00] just one continuous sound right yeah so we all okay yeah we get that but the point of it is
[01:03:05] is that in order for us to appreciate things we really do have to give it our attention which means
[01:03:11] making space which means putting down maybe the phone or the TV or yeah and and and blocking out
[01:03:19] some actual time to sit alone and think for a few minutes here and there about let's let's
[01:03:24] brainstorm some ideas of making you know X better or or changing Y um and and but if you don't
[01:03:31] spend that time it's unlikely do we merge because we do live in this culture of cons I mean we
[01:03:37] have a device in our pocket that is unlimited it's unlimited and it's ability to entertain us
[01:03:42] it's completely unlimited it's the most powerful thing that we could have ever imagined now
[01:03:47] sits in our pocket and can give us any sort of feeling we wanted any given time we just can
[01:03:52] dial it up so it's it's almost quite it's actually quite dangerous in a sense so it's extremely
[01:03:57] difficult thanks a lot Steve jobs it's all his fault but I mean I I struggle with it I I will mind
[01:04:06] lessly open apps on my phone and I'm like what am I doing you know and and I will say that if
[01:04:13] sounds overwhelming to set everything aside and have a brainstorming session some people are like
[01:04:18] what's that even mean it you don't have to go forward with always having a purpose to something
[01:04:24] and and that is something that I've learned as I've gotten older because you know what when I was
[01:04:29] younger and when I was a ski racer I couldn't just like go for a stroll right I have to do like
[01:04:33] intervals right sprinting for 30 seconds and then recovering and sprinting and recovering and
[01:04:38] all my friends were like you're crazy can you just come on a walk with us I'm like no actually I can't
[01:04:41] have to train and so now it's okay to just be right if you can figure out a way to just be
[01:04:48] so if you if you don't want to turn your phone off and do a brainstorming session for your job
[01:04:54] or you know for your business turn your phone off and just go for a walk or take a shower or
[01:05:01] you know if you like to paint paint just make space for you not to be so um
[01:05:09] turned on all the time because all of a sudden you will be on that walk with no intention
[01:05:14] of coming up with any ideas for your business and you will be like hey how did I not think of this
[01:05:19] sooner because all of a sudden your mind has the capacity to actually problem solve um and
[01:05:26] that's just burnout the grind culture doesn't allow it doesn't have that space so you got to make it
[01:05:33] I think that's perfectly said and great place for us to wrap what I would like to say for
[01:05:38] everyone listening is that Breckenridge is a town where people oftentimes have you know a condo
[01:05:44] that they go to visit and ski in or maybe they have a second home because they enjoy you know
[01:05:50] everything about that part of the country which it's like such a perfect sort of place um and
[01:05:56] and so this is an opportunity for anyone listening if you do have clients that love to ski or love
[01:06:01] to be outdoors and are looking in areas to maybe retire to or even have a second home you know
[01:06:07] Leah and her team would love the opportunity to connect with you um Leah or and of course if
[01:06:13] anyone's listening out there who is looking to purchase or or list a property in the Breckenridge
[01:06:18] in some county area I mean Leah and her team obviously are a great choice they are not only one
[01:06:24] of the top teams in the area their Leah and her team is literally one of the top agents in all
[01:06:29] of Coldwell Baker including not just this country but the entire world so if somebody out there
[01:06:34] is looking to connect with you and in some way Leah what's the best way that they should do that
[01:06:39] oh man you know here's the thing about being a REALTOR you could just look up my name and you will
[01:06:43] find all of my personal information so you it's pretty easy to find my phone number my website
[01:06:49] my email but yeah we can send everyone right over to the website which is mounthomesgroup.com
[01:06:57] again mounthomespluralgroup.com the link will be in our show notes and you can find all things
[01:07:04] Leah there you can connect with her it should you you know want to you know set up a referral system
[01:07:09] and by the way Leah also has I'm sure clients that move from the area as well so probably a good
[01:07:16] person to connect with um so and so Leah we we are so excited congratulations again on the

[01:07:35] course seeming seems very well deserved and we wish you the very best as you're you know again

I want you to visit Leah at her group's homepage, which is mountainhomesgroup.com. Again, mountainhomesgroup.com. That link will be in our show notes. Leah, welcome to the show. Thank you. What an intro. Well, I will tell you the intro doesn't even begin to really explain how excited I am because we've done, I think I don't know what number episode this will be some 400, the low 400s. And I oftentimes, this is a little embarrassing. I sometimes don't get to do the prep for the show until pretty close to the show. I have people that help put together notes for me. And I was really excited this morning when I got to the office and started reading about you because not only, of course, you know, you have this sort of impressive background with competitive skiing and being an athlete, but also having a tremendous success pretty early on in the business career of being a real state agent. And you also gave us some talking points that we're going to get into about grind culture and your thoughts on that. So I am really, really excited to chat with you. So thank you for coming on the show. I don't always get to say that or don't always even feel that sometimes with all of the guests that we have as much as I love our guests. This one really speaks to me this topic of grind culture. So I would love to start all the way at the beginning of sort of where you entered. I'd love to start really at the beginning of competitive skiing and move our way into real estate because I think there's probably some parallels and some disciplines that that translated over. But tell us about this. How did had you been skiing your entire life starting out very young or did you get into it when you were okay. Now, yeah, I started very young, learned skiing. I was two. My dad actually a whole different story, but he's an amputee above the knee. He was a big skier and he was a parent, a parent, a parent, a fiance. So he really got me into the sport. And I ski raised through my whole childhood, through being a young adult. I got to travel internationally to ski race, which was very cool. I don't think I even realized how cool it was until now. And I started to get some really good success. But I was one of those people that was always going like 120%. So that led to actually quite a bit of injury in my career. I had five knee surgeries before I turned 20. And that was really, they have quite a long recovery time period. So for like five or six years, I was just under the knife and in physical therapy and just always trying to get back into sport and then re-enduring myself. So that was where the injuries were the injuries due to like falling or were they like wearing out the cartilage or Yeah, it was a little bit of bold. It was some like coming back to sport too soon or too aggressively some certainly crashing. Some actually were due, I think to some procedures that in the medical field, they thought we're going to be very successful and actually had a pretty high failure rate. So some failed kind of installations of you know ligaments and so forth. But yeah, it was it was a lot. So ultimately that was going to be my career path. I had decided for myself. Were you were you thinking like were you looking Olympics? Was that sort of that was the ball? Yeah, yeah, absolutely. Yeah, that was going to be this was my life. But I decided, hey, look, this is my body's not designed for this and this is too much. I'm not going to get that much in my I quit. Yeah, which was tough. But then after that, I wasn't sure what to do. I worked at a coffee shop down, which is still here in breakfast plants for a few years and I was like, OK, I got it. I got to do something. I could felt like I had to do something. So I went to a local community college just for like the summer. I went to a few classes. Sure. How did an economics teacher who said hey, like buy these books, buy these business books. So I bought them and my now husband at the time was like, what a waste of money. Like those are going to put you to sleep. You're never going to read those. I like to tell that story now because they literally changed our lives. We just started our journey into learning about like financial freedom and personal finance and how real estate can have such a huge role in this developing net worth and like freedom of your own life really. Yeah, all those great topics. So do you mind sharing one or more of those titles just to say if they changed your life, I want to hear about major. They did. And there's so many good ones, but like some of the real basics learning like what an asset is, what a liability is. Yeah, for Shadcorded. I read that. I like light bulb. You know, some people love that book. Some people hate it. But I felt like it was life changing for me. Can I ask you a question about that book? Cause I always want to ask someone. Do is a primary residence in asset. I know this is a debatable topic. You know, okay. I think it depends. I can't just say I don't know because the definition of an asset in my mind and probably from you know, reading verbatim from the book is something that makes you money. Right, which this does not only on the day you sell it. Exactly. You can make you money. Yeah. Exactly. And we've taken this approach with our primary residence at least that we decided to build this and build it as an investment. But you know, the fact that we didn't sell it after a couple years and we're still living here. It's questionable. You know, so it's a lifestyle. Maybe someday. It's a lifestyle investment. But I will say that we were very intentional about the equity we had in our house, the location, making sure that we were treating it not just as a primary residence, but also as an investment. So we had our most one had on when we pursued our home. And I think we always kind of will. But it depends. The only reason I'm bringing that up is I feel that oftentimes I'll ask REALTORS not so much on the show, but just in my, you know, my day to day, understand. And sometimes they've never been asked that question. And I've always thought it's a really important thing to have a position on whether it's yes, it's an asset. No, it's not or it depends. And I think it depends. Have an answer because there are a lot of people who will be having questions like that. And anyway, so I'm sorry, I don't want to get us in what's an asset. Just because you mentioned that I wanted to hear your perspective. I would say that it's a really important savings account, especially for people who maybe aren't very actively investing, having equity built in your home is some of the. It's the only way for some people that they can actually successfully retire. So if you're not an active investor and you're not having buying, you know, and cash, holding invests and properties and building up your 401k or your retirement and sometimes the home is your only real worth in when it comes to networks. So I think it's extremely important for a lot of people. So anyway, you read, read books like rich dad, and how did you decide to get into get into real estate as not just maybe an investor or as somebody who's going to be selling it? Yes, so we started on the investment side. I actually then went to see you Boulder got my degree in finance and real estate during which time we started a very small investment company like a few people and bought a little house and fixed it up and rented it out and then sold it and then did that a handful of times. And after the first time we bought that house, I was like, we bought this and I have absolutely no idea what just happened. Right. You know, I went to school to study this and I'm like, what, you know, so then I realized I need to get my real estate license to learn what I'm doing in order to be a real investor who takes herself seriously. So I started and just found my license to support the investment side and then it really grew from there. And I realized just how number one, it was much more challenging than I thought it was going to be and number two was more lucrative than I thought it could ever be and more fun. So yeah, it grew. And how long have you been practicing as a REALTOR? It's been almost seven years, so 2015. Yeah. So you got it. You really got into it pretty quickly after so your ski career sort of came to a conclusion then it was college and then right into sort of investing real estate. Yeah. Yeah. And being a REALTOR. So let's go back seven years only because so seven years doing the quick math on that. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. 2015ish. I was trying to think of what the market conditions were at that time. What was it like starting a career in real estate? Now, yes, you, you imagine you have some sort of public notoriety being from Breckenridge being being a competitive skier that that's probably been in the newspapers a lot and sort of the, you know, whatever publications people there read. So I'm sure you're known to some degree in your community, although there's probably a lot of competitive skiers there too. There's some incredible aspects there. But did, you know, but making a pivot. Oh, I'm sure making a pivot from professional being a professional athlete to then selling a real estate. It is a person in their early twenties. What was that like? I imagine that couldn't have been necessarily an easy thing. No, it really wasn't. People did don't mean for sure, but they weren't, they knew me as like someone's kid. They knew my parents. They knew me because I have done here since I was like mine. Right. And so they weren't, you know, when it comes time for them to sell their multi million dollar home, they're not like, yeah, let's hire, let's hire a fun. And so that was certainly tough. And not only that, but our market is extremely saturated with agents. There's like this running joke that, you know, if you've already been our party, they've had people that are real estate agents. And so it was highly competitive as well. So my initial strategy actually wasn't to go after clientele of local people that I knew because they also already knew it doesn't are more agent, but it's been in a business much longer than me. So that wasn't my initial approach. I started really focusing on one of our our number one feeder market, which is the Denver Front Range area and working on getting those people as they come into town and stroll mainstream and also making really good connections with the agents that work in Denver that have clients who say, hey, we're thinking about finding something in the mountains. So that was my approach and I think that that really helped me get a foothold in the industry instead of, you know, it's another one of those books that I read that's great as the blue ocean strategy. I don't know the sweet say that one more time blue ocean. Yeah, so the blue ocean and it's just in a nutshell, it's like, you know, you have your red ocean, which is highly competitive. You know, I think it's like the local Breckenridge agent is red ocean. Competing with the, you know, for the same clients that everyone was competing for and the blue ocean strategy is like, hey, what's the way that you can look at your business a little differently where you have a lot less competition. And that was the way that I did that was say, hey, I'm not going to compete for this one client that has, you know, a dozen REALTOR friends. I'm going to go after this person who doesn't know anybody in Brecken. Yeah, I love that. So you made, you made friends with, with REALTORS in the Denver area. Yeah, because you don't support the Denver area personally or no, and they don't support Breckenridge. So this is, this is, that makes, boy, that makes so much sense. Really a great opportunity for any of our listeners who either, you know, live in areas where people buy vacation homes or maybe where they retire to or in the flip side, you have people that are leaving to go elsewhere in Illinois, Florida is, is a place where a lot of for tax purposes, people retire for, obviously, the weather and, you know, whatever other reasons, they might go there. And so that would be, you know, anyone who's a Florida agent, you should be just calling every REALTOR you know in the country and saying, hey, if they're thinking of moving here. So that's very interesting. So how, so, so you then you was more about building relationships. And you also said something also as, as the people from Denver were coming into town, how were you sort of intercepting? Well, so I don't know if all the offices have like a Florida agent, right? So I was working on floor a lot. I was at, and we have an office right on Main Street. And that was extremely difficult for me because I had to overcome this sense that there was like something wrong with sales people that they were like bad people. And I had that somehow ingrained in me that like, if I was going to sell something to someone, I was like doing a bad thing, right? So I was not a natural one sales person. And so it was very awkward the first few times I interacted with people. I like blocked out the person and locked in. They walked out. I was like, what's up? And, but you know, everything takes practice. And eventually I got at the confidence to just be personal, be myself and chat with these guys. And it also took me acknowledging that, hey, I'm not just like, I'm not trying to take advantage of someone trying to, you know, help them because I am and a resource for them. So once I kind of shifted my mindset that a sales person is not like a parasite, but instead a, you know, a source of wealth of information and, you know, a friend, someone who can help you with something that you need. Once I made that shift, it was a lot easier for me. Yeah, I, I, I so agree with that. And for anyone out there who's struggling with what Leo was talking about, this idea of, I'm bothering people. They don't want to talk to me. They think I'm gross because I'm a sales person and nobody likes sales people and all of that. Yes, there's truth in all of that, of course. But if you're not a gross, um, slimy sales person, you don't have to worry about coming off the slimy and gross. It's what I say to guys all the time who go, I wonder if that girl thinks I'm a creep. I'm like, are you a creep? If you're not, you don't, you can go ask her out. It's okay because if you're not a creep, you don't have to worry about being perceived as creepy and the same thing to sales people. If you're not a horrible human being, then you can go ahead and talk to people who by the way, 99% chance they're going to use a REALTOR anyway. So this isn't even something like, hey, you really need to get into this bizarre insurance that you don't even know about, but I'm going to try to convince you you need, which by the way is a perfectly fine industry as well. I love insurance agents, but that's a much tougher sale sometimes because it's selling things that people don't even know they need. But in your case, they're going to use a REALTOR. So I just wanted to really honor you for saying that because I think it's so easy to forget that everybody's when they, everybody starts out in this business, it's, it's, it's a little nerve wracking to have your first open house to sit. And I love the fact that you live in an area where people still walk into offices that is not as common in the country, but it's a little bit of a trial by fire because they're coming in. And or, you know, they're walking by and you're not having to strike up a conversation. Yeah, or at the end of it, I would be walking out on to Main Street, like, hey, what are you looking at in this window? Let's talk about it. So yeah, took a little confidence boost. I love that. So, so you really jumped in and again, you're still a young person, but I guess I guess it to make sense because you talked about everybody in town knows me as, you know, I'm a skier. I'm, I'm my father's daughter. I am, you know, I'm a kid, you know, and I'm a kid in my early 20s. I'm an adult technically, but people in town maybe not only do they maybe see me a certain way they also have, you know, a handful of other agents that maybe their best friends with who are probably going to get the listings, you know, above you just because that's how things work. So let's talk about it. So you started working at, you know, in the office and, and, you know, dealing with floor time and sort of trial by fire, I sort of would say is having direct one on one conversations. And then how did you grow from there? Yeah, so, you know, I started pretty early on coming up with a business plan. And I think that those two words together caused people some lot of anxiety. But I don't remember who said this might have been mark you, but he's like, hey, if you can't come up with a business plan in the amount of time that it takes you to drink the can of soda like you're doing it wrong. And that stuck with me because it was like, okay, don't overcomplicate it. I get a small piece of paper or a post it note or whatever. And I write down what I want to do in sales, you know, how does that translate? What's my average sales price? What do I think is attainable? How many sales is that? How many appointments do I need to do? Do I need to make? And then I also did some really crude math of approximately how many people do I think I need my database? Sure. I went to a ninja class. I think they said something like, you know, every person your database translates to something like $10,000 of income or something something along those lines might be misquoting. But I said, look, I need to start building my database like nobody I need to start putting my name. We can't feel next to luxury real estate in as many instances I can. So I started putting more and more people in my database and coming up with a plan that they saw my face and heard my name next to real estate. I also started doing some like something I learned from Barbara Corcoran, which is reach out to your local newspaper like these these people are just usually young and hungry and overworked and have to come up with content for the newspaper and they don't know like they have to do it every single day. And so if you help them and say, hey, look, this is super interesting. This is happening in our market nine times out of 10. They're going to call you back and say, hey, can you explain us to me? And can I quote you on this? And then all of a sudden, your name is in the newspaper next to luxury real estate or whatever you decide. That's really. I'm going to pause you. That is incredibly interesting. Nobody has ever ever made that suggestion on this podcast. So super exclusive for us. So I want to I want to just just unwind that a little bit so that our audience really hits. I thought you were going to go a different way with it, which is I do have this kind of cool story about my background as a you know a junior skier who was you know headed to to Olympics and now I've pivoted because of injuries. And like that's a very interesting story just in and of itself that a newspaper might be interested in, but that's a one off. And so I thought we were going to say, well, I just wanted to sort of trade in a little bit on my notoriety and get some publicity, which that would have made all the sense in the world to me too. But you actually went a totally different way. I want their reporters to call me when they need a quote or they need help with definitions or that is beyond brilliant because you're absolutely right. These are people that work on incredible deadlines. They're underworked. They are certain they're overworked and underpaid. Yeah, sorry. There are very overworked and underpaid and it's a stressful position. And you can help actually make their lives a little easier. And so people say that the reporter started using you in stories, I guess. Yeah, yeah. And I still try at least once a month to send them something interesting that's happening because I pull data for my news, whatever month I'm looking at, you know, what's happening this month in our market, what are some you know sales that are very interesting or what you know we've seen some really crazy stuff in our market, right? Like sure 200% appreciation of this and you know, that's a great new story. Yeah, right. And it's a headline. So anytime I see something that I'm like, this would be a good headline. I send it. So how often how often do they end up using your your ideas? I'm just 70% of the time, you know, everyone's like, oh my gosh, but most of the time they're like, they call me back to might be two weeks or three weeks later. And they're like, hey, just circling back to this. Can you tell me more about that? And then it ends up, yeah. That is that is so incredibly smart. I, I'm a little bit sort of gobsmacked with that. I really apps, which is a great word that I'm just starting to incorporate more into my, it's one of those words that sort of makes you seem smarter than saying I'm stunned. But, but I am, I am gobsmacked and or stunned because that is an absolutely brilliant strategy. So thank you for that. So okay, started. Yeah. So you started doing that that helped. I imagine get your name out there. It did get helped with more of my like my sometimes my older clientele. Maybe I would get a referral to someone who wanted to sell. And they're like, wait, keep seeing your name in the newspaper. And so that gives you credibility. So my struggle was credibility, right? I was maybe they knew my parents, you know, maybe they knew that I grew up here. But they certainly didn't trust me to sell their luxury home. And so I had to kind of chip away at that credibility. And my goal is when someone thinks of love at a real estate, they think of me. So anytime I could put my name next to luxury real estate in people's minds, then that's the win. Really, what it really all what what you what you could really do for those of us thinking, well, what kind of stories. I mean, you literally just can look at data and the MLS. I mean, it really interesting statistic that is like a little shocking even you send that over go guys. I have an idea for you. Yeah. And don't you don't give them too much. I mean, like I said, these guys are overworked. Don't put more than five sentences in your email, right? Give them a give them a clip, give them a taste and see if they're interested. They'll call you. Love it. Yeah. So yeah, I did that. I started. I also realized pretty early on that I was very interested in new construction and developments. And I learned that when a town or a county wants to hire a contractor, they have to go through a very transparent process because the last thing I'm municipality wants to be accused of is, you know, like taking kickbacks and hiring their friends for a job. And so when a town wants to hire a real estate agent to sell a town built project, they have to go through an RFP request for proposal process. And I learned about this pretty early on in my career, like in a year and a half and maybe. And had a friend, he just got her license and we were like, should we put a proposal in for this project. We're a total long shot, but it was for a local project is still pretty big. It's 25 million dollar project. And we ended up winning the bid because people felt we just went in and created a very professional looking proposal. We took it very seriously and they felt that we would be a good face for the project. We got it. So that is also something that's interesting for people to know is that oftentimes you're like towns and counties have are doing some of their own real estate development because in so many areas, there's a lack of. And so if you're a job employee or local housing and they're trying to address up themselves, anyone can apply for those for those sales jobs. So that's how I really got started in the development world and that I learned a ton doing that project. And it was a really great experience. And then I faced kind of another challenge after that, which was okay. Now people kind of know me as the like employee housing person. How do I pivot and become. You know, luxury salesperson, which is more of the area that I was interested in at the time. And so I just kept kept doing what I was talking about earlier, which is, hey, put my name next to lugger real estate. We're sending a newsletter. We have luxury listings in there. Right. We made comments. We're talking about the luxury market because that's really one of me. You kind of like manifest your your goals that way. Yeah, that it makes sense is you you you really I think what we're really talking about is branding. It sounds like you you very, very early on, you know, sort of developed your brand. You were clear about what you wanted your brand to represent. And yes, you're not going to turn down a $25 million development deal from a local municipality. Simply because it doesn't necessarily fit the the brand, you know, I deal. But it's a great opportunity, a great learning experience and how awesome to be chosen. So you're going to do that. And then you're going to you're going to still return to your north star, which is luxury. Yeah, yeah, your stars is and I want to mention to that a lot of times agents. I'm curious to get your thoughts on this. And you see this as well with other agents. I'm sure in your market is a lot of times the way agents think about branding is it's all about the visual. So they're doing a lot on social Instagram Facebook. There's a lot of, you know, but you don't really that's not really your path. Now that's a very that's a very unique way. So talk about is is social a part of your marketing strategy or I'm just curious what the importance of it is. Yeah, I think it's more important than we give it credit for we could certainly improve on it. We're always talking about it and everyone. I've since built a team which we can talk about, but everyone on my team is like, we need to do better at this. So certainly, like anyone, we're not perfect and social media is one of those things that we can really improve on, but we, you know, you don't have to be good at everything. You have to do everything. You're just going to be great to be great. You just have to be great at a few things. And so I think we're kind of leaning into the things that we're really good at and it kind of makes up for some of our things that we're not so great at, which is like social media. But I'm not saying that to identify something that's that's you're not strong and I was and I hope hopefully you didn't get that impression. I'm not sure if that's like that. No. Good because I really was saying it as as a huge differentiator that that that obviously you could always, you know, get good at social if you want to, but that's not how you built your luxury brand. And you really sort of avoided that, which again, you could have traded in a lot of your previous success as a skier as you could have really leaned into some of these accolades that you've, you've received and and made that a big push on social, but you didn't do that. And I think that's particularly interesting. And I think again, it, it sort of creates a more of a red ocean opportunity for you to find other, find other. Yeah, yeah, red ocean. Yeah, we have. So yeah, I think branding can be very simple. Honestly, for me, like I said, my, my mountain decline was the credibility mountain, right, because I was young. I was a girl. A lot of people knew me as someone's kid. So I had to, I had to convince people that I was legit. Something I actually haven't really told anyone, which is that when I first started, I didn't ever sent, I had was like going towards some investment because we were so into investing. And so I didn't really ever save up to like, buy a nice car. So I drove this kind of beat up little Subaru. And I certainly couldn't, you know, with a straight face, bring a luxury client into it and tour them on these luxury homes. So I, my parents, I live in Bracken region. And anytime I would have a client or a walk and I'd tell my mom who drove a Lexus. And I was like, can I use your likes and choose the best mom ever. She's like, yes, you can. And so I'm coming right down to just like how, how you present your not, I'm not trying to say that anyone who wants to become a luxury REALTOR needs to drive a Lexus or a luxury car. But, but presenting yourself in the most professional way that you can, anytime you can, the way that you dress, the way that you speak, the, you know, how we arrive, all of that makes an impact and all of that does attribute to your branding. It's not just who you are online because even though social media has exploded so much, I'm still in the generation where I was here before, you know, the internet. And, and your brand really is who you are when you're standing in front of your client. And so how can you be the person that you want to be in, you know, if you want to be a luxury real estate agent, what does that look like? And if you have to fake it and say, make it the time to drive your mom Lexus around or your friend, you know, you pay your friend. 50 bucks every time she lends you her BMW because you drive a beat up Subaru do it, you know, find ways that you can present yourself as the brand you want to be and that helped me as well with even it also helps with confidence, you know, dress to impress you feel, you feel more confident. So yeah, yeah, I agree that's I think that's that's really really great advice. And so, let's talk about grind culture because before we get into this, I want to hear you're more you are firmly in the anti grind culture camp. And I love that because so often we hear about outworking our competition, working more hours, especially in real estate, where so much happens outside of the traditional business hours. Yeah, you know, our listeners are getting text messages, voice mails, you know, all sorts of things late into the evening boundaries are hard to set their hard to follow it's also an unstructured job from the REALTOR side so it's it's tough. And it's easy to just keep going and going and going because the text thread really never ends until they get the keys. And then until you forget to respond until you forget to respond. Yeah, yeah, and that's yeah, so let's talk about that let's talk about grind culture and and what what why you've taken sort of a stance against it. Okay, so I live in Brecknerage, I love the listeners are familiar, but it's a gorgeous mountain town in Colorado, no first skiing biking outdoor activities. And when I first started in real estate, I, I was a one one woman show as most people are, and I really wanted to be successful and I'm a competitive person, right. So I threw everything at it just like I did with with ski racing and I remember we we went on this vacation, my now husband and I and I just worked the entire time. And we were at the beach and I was on my computer when I was going back to the room and I was like calls and I was and I was just I was just running and I was on vacation and I came back and I was like that was not a vacation. That was that was relaxing at all, you know, and then I also really realized I just did a little bit of reflection and said like what do I really want my life to look like because I only get one life and there's no point in living a life that I'm not excited about because like there's no take backs, right. And so I live here in this gorgeous place because I love to go skiing, I love to go mountain biking, I love to go for hikes, I love to be outside and I can't do all of that if I'm on all the time. And so I decided that this job, you know, there's multiple things can be true at the same time. Yes. Number one, I want to provide a really high level of service to my clients, right. Number two, I'm not perfect. I one of my very first deals, I like completely dropped the ball on this thing and I was like, oh my gosh, what am I doing ice. Look at this. And it helped me realize that I. The person who's going to do everything at all times, otherwise my life is not going to be what I want it to be. And so we should we should mention that some people can somehow eat that out. Some people can seemingly do. Some people are designed for that. Some people are designed for it. I think the majority of us probably I'm not either. And so and I, you know, when I'm out on a mountain bike ride and I get a call from a client, I want to be able to help them, but I also don't want to take the call because I'm on a mountain bike ride. And that's my time to, you know, clear my head. And so what I settled on was I need help and I will plug another book that changed my life called the e-mix. Oh, sure. Yeah, the entrepreneurship myth. I recommend if you haven't read it every real church of read it. It's about the importance of building a business like a real business and recognizing what roles you play. Because if you are one man show, you are the CEO, you are the, you know, COO, you're all the whole executive suite. You're also the receptionist and you're you're you're the marketing customer service. You're the social media. Sales team. Right. So write it down. Say like, Hey, I'm all these people. Am I good at all plus am I a good receptionist or am I bad at answering the phone. If I'm bad at answering the phone or if I don't like it, then hire someone to help you with it. And so going back to that project that we did with the town of Breck, that that project having that almost like guaranteed future income of that development gave me the confidence to bring on my first assistant. And that was a game changer because I realized that I can provide the level of service that I want to my clients while also enjoying my life. And not only that, I could provide a better level of service to my clients than if I was just grinding it up alone because I started. I think a lot of real terms become a victim of their own success. They're like, OK, if only I can reach this sales number. If only I could have a few more contracts or a few more clients and then they get there and they're like, whoa, I've got 10 things under contract fully mully and they're like going crazy. And then they're like, I don't have time to put together a monthly newsletter this month. Like I have 10 contracts, right? I don't have time to prospect. I don't have time to send these whatever the mailers, whatever your strategy is. And so they start dropping the ball and the things that are not urgent because you have to you're not going to drop the ball on your contract, right? Hopefully. And so having that assistant having a team built around you helps so that when you do get busy, your monthly newsletter still goes out on the first of the month. Right. And you can have a more consistent, reliable level of service to your clients because you have built a system and you understood that, hey, I cannot do it all by myself. And I'm actually I'm doing a disservice to my client trying to do everything myself because I also get sick and I also get burnt out in my awesome competition. Well, and that that probably is a lesson. A lot of a lot of that you probably learned as a teenager being a competitive, you know, supergie scare because you you you can pardon the pun, get to the top of the mountain and be on that Olympic team or even win, win, you know, whatever event of the Olympics you were going for. And then you can I mean all of those are possible. They certainly were possible in your life. And yet, how happy, you know, the happiness that you're that that you're sort of wanting or the fulfillment you're wanting may come at a significant cost because the level of sort of output that that requires to get to the top of the mountain as a singular person is, well, you know, it's incredible amount of demand on your body on your mind on your time. And so I have a question about texting a very specific question. So you were talking about, you know, you get the phone call your mountain biking. Now you're like, okay, assistance going to grab that I get it. You'll you'll have that routed to the assistant. What about text messages. Yeah, text messages are tough. They are really tough. I would say that if it's something that I either don't have the mental space for or I have something else going on right now, I will just screen grab that and send it to my. Send it to my assistant and say can you help me with this or you know, I'll say, hey, my this, this person reached out to me about this. Can you help me because and I like to recognize it. I've learned at the beginning of the correspondence because if you're really busy and you start communicating with me, you know, you're talking with your client and then you train loop someone in, then they're like, no, I'm talking to you about this. But if they start asking you about something right away and you can say, you know, you loop someone in immediately, then that person is the point person. So I don't have a perfect answer. Texting is really tricky and I would be lying if I said that, you know, I haven't forgotten about a text and woken up in the middle of the night like, oh, never responded to that text, right. But I do love that the new iPhone, I think you can like mark them as unread. I don't have the newest iPhones. I'm excited to get that so that I can like if I open up a text and I'm not prepared to deal with it, I can mark it as unread and treat it more like a. You know, I want to pause for a moment to talk about our episode sponsor are one of my favorite companies out there follow up boss now after interviewing hundreds of top REALTORS in the country for the podcast.

But but that I think that's helpful because it also to we know when you start communicating you're setting via tax you're also setting in motion like a response time that now there's an expectation there and do you do set sort of clear boundaries around. I do my I do my own way not I don't do it up front i'm not like hey these are my business always some people who thought I really will stop that but I do it sometimes you meet you have a client or you meet someone who you kind of can tell is like a pusher you know they're going to kind of push you and push you to kind of see what your limit is and when I have a client or someone like that I I make an effort to not respond like it let's say someone who I'm not going to do it. Who's who's that personality type text me I have a client i'll just give you a little I have a client who I showed them a property. Followed up with them they kind of go sit me for like a week and then a week later I like 10 feet up they texted me and they were like hey we're ready for an offer if we could you know my husband has. work in the morning but if you could have it ready you know before he leaves for work then we can. I was like you know what i'm not responding to this because that is in my way how i'm going to set my boundaries and if I don't respond to this it's not going to set a precedent that for the whole contract period i'm available to be work for you during the night hours. Right because you're in a position when that text comes in you're in a position to either defend why you can't do it. Yeah which is a Louis situation or or you're going to grind it out and try to get it done at the cost of sleep and energy and other things and. I know now also reinforcing their behavior yeah now they're going they're going to it's not like they're magically going to snap to. Oh going forward we're going to you know not text you pass five o'clock know you just told them it's perfectly okay what you just did. So yes that's you're exactly right I don't want to reinforce that behavior and and there's with some clients in certain instances you know i've a client who's a. A surgeon and his hours are super tough and you wanted to have a call to be like 8 30 and it's like okay I get it and I can tell he's not that personality he's going to start calling me. I'm not a 30 so I feel like I can read people and I don't set exact hours I respect the people who do but I think that it's important before you you know if you don't feel like you want to respond to someone because of the time of day or because of. You know mostly it's a time of day time right if you're on vacation hopefully you have coverage from someone but if it's in the middle of the night thing don't do it if it's that person who's going to just keep. Because sometimes you work with these clients for like years if they don't find anything or they get to other house and so then all of a sudden it's a lot harder to real back. No once you've opened those floodgates of yeah let me get that done for you to let me. I um I I agree wholeheartedly I I just think it's such a it's it's a conversation I like to have because. Text communication really is very complicated in sort of what it what it represents in different different parts of the business and so it's something that every agent really needs to think through what's my policy around x y and z and yes when I have the you know the guy who's the surgeon who's who just got out of a 16 hour surgery and and he needs to talk to me at eight o'clock at night I get it he's not trying to push my buttons or push me he's just that's when he's available of course we get that. But but we also understand that you know there there's certain ways we can set you know temporary boundaries around yeah around sort of our general behavior. I also really and I don't talk about this enough but I think we have a lot of women who come on our show and I oftentimes forget as a guy I don't think as much about this and I should but I want to talk about sort of gut feelings and I know you. Tell me a little bit about the importance of trusting your gut i mean I imagine as an athlete you have to know you know you have to listen to signals to be a competitive athlete but you know I'm curious about sort of gut instinct and how that's you know manifested in your. Yeah I'm not a very. I would say I'm a more logical person than anything else I don't know if they call it left brained I'm more logical. And so it's easy for me and I think people like me to dismiss certain feelings that they have because they're different than our contradictory maybe it's the logic yeah like hey this client is prepared to spend 10 million dollars and then you're you're feeling is like walk away right but your head is like let me have that commission before I've earned it right. And so sometimes when you have those conflicting feelings it can be tough especially if you're more of a logical person because you can dismiss these feelings that's just that right people have feelings. Because the facts the facts aren't in yet but the facts say everything looks okay but something inside of me that's more intangible and invisible is giving me pause and my logical brain is going shut up other part of you you don't you don't have any facts this is just you know whatever you're getting scared or whatever might be. And so the and by the way this is this happens all the time so I'm so glad we're talking about go ahead I'm sorry. Yeah no that's that's good so I think there's a lot of us not to get into biology but there's a lot of the human body that I think we don't totally understand most about the least. And we are hardwired with certain instincts right for eating and resting and yeah for all sorts of things that have helped protect us over however many. Um however long in history we've been a species right and so I think once I recognize that hey sometimes I got feeling is a culmination of various instincts that my body has those are legitimate actually those are just as legitimate as as you know my logical part of my brain potentially even more more so because they're older they're older and they're bypassing consciousness which consciousness. Consciousness can steer us wrong right as consciousness can tell us you know things are not the way they appear because we are imperfect our brains are imperfect instincts however 10 10 to once you're able to identify what an instinct is and and what and the difference between instinct and you know maybe. Things you know fears and things that might be getting the way yeah so I'm sorry I don't mean to. No yeah you're right you're right they're there they're to protect you your instincts are there to protect you for the most part so listen to them um you know being. Being a woman in the business I think maybe comes at a little bit higher risk um I don't generally really ever feel unsafe in the business but I have that instances where um it's become clear to me after working with a client that they're they're really trying to just fun time with me um and not they're not a real client um and either with one instance in particular whether or not. That happened I was working with someone for a lot of selling season and ended up putting it in an offer on something and and uh you know I referred him to some local unders that he could call and one of the lenders called me and he's like this guy has no has nothing right in the whole time he's of course hyping himself up like um you know I just saw this business I have all this money I believe houses and and so there's a lot that I learned from that because you know the lenders like doesn't have money for down payment doesn't have a job can't get alone no assets no one's going to loan him anything and I realized. Over the years I realized that people with real wealth first of all don't want it like that the people who do that's an immediate roadblocks and you know people who will come in the office and they start talking about how rich and successful they are there's very few of those people who actually have the means to become a real client of yours um and and maybe that's just our market I know different parts different areas are different right have different people but in our laid back mountain market the people who can afford a five million dollar house aren't aren't talking to you about their net worth. You know in the first conversation you hop with them and how the house is successful they are. So anyways it turns out this guy that I was working with had like a criminal history and I should have been a background check on him and um certainly had no means to buy a house and I had that that feeling right at the beginning and I didn't listen to it and so I said look I'm just gonna I spend a lot of time with this guy um who I think is the best way to do it. Yeah it's hard to exit something like that because because it could it could affect your reputation meaning yeah it could go online and scorched earth this REALTOR dropped me as a client I was a serious buyer blah blah blah they they you know men do weird things when women when they feel rejected. Yeah yeah so I was you know I ultimately did have to drop him because he came back and wanted to work me again and I thought you know we need to get through fall by this time he's like well you don't trust me you don't believe in the money I have. When people say you don't trust me as a question you can just not trust them that's yeah so you know a couple of things I learned from that number one we have a really good resource with our MLS um where you can do like three background check some people. Oh that's great. Yeah and I think a lot of MLS is have that they're working on that so especially if you're gonna be you know we have a lot of remote areas with like no cell service and we're out showing property um you know me and some guy that I met 21 years ago uh so that's something that's key I think we're just looking up I could have found this out by doing a Google search on the spy and I just didn't do it and then you know find ways to yes you can ask all of your clients for a pre-qualification letter or a pre-finished prior to looking at homes and I don't think there's anything wrong with that but there's also just another layer of you know I had a bad gut feeling when I met this guy and I just didn't listen to it and and there have been instances since then where I've had a similar feeling and I have listened to it and I've never regretted it. Even no matter how much because usually with these clients they're waving you know money in your face which is a first word flag but um you know it's become a lot easier for me as I've become more successful to realize I don't need this you know and it's not just about that sort of instance there's also a lot of people who aren't respectful right or they don't respect you as a professional or the industry um you know I was just in a listening appointment where the guys like look I'm not gonna sugarcoat it I think real estate professionals are overpaid and I think it's a the whole thing is a racket and you know blah blah blah and I just you know I'm gonna beat you on that I'm gonna change your mind right what are the odds that you're gonna change that person yeah yeah and also I'm not gonna I'm not gonna grovel for your business if you think that I um you know my place in the industry is unwanted because I don't actually need I don't need this I I can find success working with people who are like me who um see the bigger picture and who are respectful you know and and that's also just been a lifestyle decision for me as like hey not only do I want to respect my own boundaries of when I when I want to be working and when I don't want to be working but I also want to set my own boundaries of like who do I want to work it because this is my life you know and and work is a big part of my life and so I would rather sell 80% of of what I could sell and just work with good you know honest people and I'm not saying you know any to anyone in the luxury field knows that not every client not every luxury fine is easy I'm not trying to say hey this guy's gonna be hard let's ditch it because we work with our fair share of of difficult clients and I can be difficult myself so we all have our own things right but when you get the feeling that someone is um you know not trustworthy or trying to lie about who knows what or um just like not a good person you get that feeling I think you should listen to it because why spend your time working with bad people question has your gut ever since you become a REALTOR has your gut ever steered you wrong no honestly it hasn't and it's been so hard for me because that's not my personality to yes your logical yeah oriented look at the data uh and and it's so hard because I can't explain you know I can't explain like why you can't walk it back and say oh the reason I had that feeling was because uh x y and z it's like no the feeling showed up before I was aware of anything yeah and I and I'm still not perfect like I just um I still have instances where I have this this gut feeling of like this isn't gonna end well you know maybe I should decline this and then I kind of like work work past it and work through it and then sure enough my gut was right and I'm like okay so it's not like I have you know just the perfect you know instinct that I'm always listening to sometimes I'm like you know that up I should have listened to I should have listened to how I felt but um I think that's an important thing that we don't really talk about enough it just in general is that it's listen listen to how you feel because also if if for nothing less than when when someone calls you if you immediately get a pay in your stomach I mean you're gonna get a pay in your stomach every single time you need to talk to this person and you need to you need to figure out whether or not you want to live with a pay in your stomach because that's not a way to live right so try and find a way try and find a way to to be at peace with the people that you work with and um it's okay to say no sometimes you know so as you've stepped away from sort of grinding it out which I imagine you know as the at the athlete part of you understands grinding it out and that's how you achieve and it really is you know in many ways such a significant part of an athlete's life yeah sort of dropping that and trusting that that you can still progress and achieve and scale the mountain without necessarily burning you know the candle at both ends what does your life look like now is it more balanced um you know and how are you able to still achieve more which you know you're still in the early early phase of your real estate career where you're doing more and more and more and obviously you know this year's kind of you know a different year for most REALTORS but you're still moving forward and achieving how do you do that while maintaining balance what what does that look like for you yeah um well so so I will kind of like there's this I'll mention this adage that I have heard that I really appreciate I think it's an old African adage hopefully I'm not misquoting it but um it says if you want to go fast go alone and if you want to go far go as a team and I think that they meant it very literally like if you need to get somewhere fast you better start running by yourself and if you need to cross a great distance you better go with the people um and I I really like that saying because I I am kind of alone wolf in my by nature um like I only did I didn't do team sports I did individual sports right and I was extremely competitive as an individual and um I burnt myself out and was plagued with injury and the thing that meant most to me at that time which was experiencing and I did I did get to a pretty high level but I I didn't I think um and so I realized that you know I should take something away from that which is life hopefully for for most of us is quite long and if you want to have success in in something and you want to have elongated success then it's important that you work with a team whatever that looks like for you I'm not saying every single person needs to start a real estate team but it's important that you recognize the going out of the loan it's it's tough to you know it's tough to do stuff alone so if that just means you have a support group or a group of agents that you meet with to like you know talk to about your your highs and lows together whatever that may be so um that that wasn't really the answer to your question so to answer your question what my life head looks like now is uh it's certainly and my business it's not perfect there's always things where I'm like oh I need to improve on this or we should be doing this and um and so it's I think it's always going to be like that though so I've just kind of I become comfortable with that feeling of this is not perfect and I don't love that a little bit of a perfectionist so but that's okay right I'm I'm I have to tell myself it's okay to get my business is not perfect because it's improving and well you said something at the beginning that um probably skated by a lot of us but you said two things can be true right and and that's yeah that's I think that's called like dialectical thinking this idea of yeah uh two things that could be in opposition can also be true right we all know if we have a romantic partner we can love that person with all our heart and really be annoyed at something they did at the exact same time yeah and and letting one of those emotions totally take over is probably not not the healthiest thing is understanding yes there's times I'm annoyed with you and there's times I love you more than anything and all of those can be true at the exact moment um yeah and so a life can be out of balance and by the way I don't think balance I'm not even sure balance is possible but the striving to sort of balance is is very you know important and this idea that you can be uh because you are good at things and also not good at things simultaneously right like you were saying yeah right so so yeah I would agree I think finding um I think I've heard of it maybe it's called like a false dichotomy where it's like well it has to be this or that right that I have to either enjoy my life or have a successful career and I can't be happy until yeah right right right I can either um enjoy my life or I can save all money writing it's like well you can do both right so I think I think it's extremely important for people in our profession they take their real estate class if you're new in the industry or if you've been doing it forever um there's no like you said earlier it's not really defined you know no one gives you like a manual and says here's your job description they're like hey go good luck you know sell stuff because that's how you get paid so um it's really important to have the headspace to be able to be a little bit introspective and figure out what you want your life to look like because it's one of the best careers in the world to be able to design your own life around it you could say hey look I'm I don't really feel that competitive I only really want to sell enough to pay my rent and go surfing every day and you can do that right or you can say like hey I want to become the top agent in this market you know let's start coming up with some ways that you can do that and also go on for vacations here or hold whatever you want to do because the most successful people aren't going out of the lung you know the most successful businesses aren't one person and every single one of us runs a business so I think we're just I think that the grind you know grind to you die lifestyle it doesn't take that into consideration that you're you're cutting yourself short and you're doing a disservice to your clients because you really can't like we are human we have to sleep right and we have to take a rest and if we really want to develop a good business we need to sometimes take days off so that we can have a creative thought so that we're not just like when learned is money deadline when okay did I review that title commitment and I gotta gotta get to this appointment because if your if your mind is constantly on to do lists you can't operate in a creative space that way you can't come up with new ways to to do things better than other people so you know give yourself some space headspace by taking a few things off your plate so you're not just like running around like a chicken with her head cut off and you can actually have an original thought like this is something no one else in my market is doing what if we did that right and I think that's only possible if you if you can get some help and make and make space right and getting help oftentimes makes that space as as you were saying and and you know too for those of us listening who are solo practitioners who are thinking well I can't afford to hire you know a an assistant well there as you know there are websites where you can post jobs that all over the world people will bid for your business and they don't have to live in your immediate market for for certain tasks and there's you know there's lots of things that these are can be highly skilled people that live in in areas where the compensation is much different than it is here and oftentimes much lower and you're offering them an opportunity to make a good living for them and also get the help that you need where maybe you can afford to to get a full-time you know local assistant right away and yeah there's a lot of there's a lot of creative solutions like that I mean you can if you live there a college people need to intern and they don't they don't necessarily even need to be paid right and or if you have a group of agents in your office and you guys don't even work together but you're like hey I can't afford someone salary but I could afford one fifth of someone salary but about you right so there's a lot of different ways you can accomplish this but I I do think that if you're going to take your business seriously you know and and you pick up the email and you read it and you realize that you're both the CEO and the receptionist of your business everything in between there's a better way yeah better for your life too and I just want to circle back and this last thing I'll mention because I think it's really important and you said this and it's quite profound um this idea of making space for ideas to emerge so you're talking about it reminded me of of the saying which is technically it's not even a saying it's it's just true is that music that that we enjoy it it's not actually the notes that that are that we're sort of interpreting we're actually interpreting the silence between the notes because otherwise it's just one continuous sound right yeah so we all okay yeah we get that but the point of it is is that in order for us to appreciate things we really do have to give it our attention which means making space which means putting down maybe the phone or the TV or yeah and and and blocking out some actual time to sit alone and think for a few minutes here and there about let's let's brainstorm some ideas of making you know X better or or changing Y um and and but if you don't spend that time it's unlikely do we merge because we do live in this culture of cons I mean we have a device in our pocket that is unlimited it's unlimited and it's ability to entertain us it's completely unlimited it's the most powerful thing that we could have ever imagined now sits in our pocket and can give us any sort of feeling we wanted any given time we just can dial it up so it's it's almost quite it's actually quite dangerous in a sense so it's extremely difficult thanks a lot Steve jobs it's all his fault but I mean I I struggle with it I I will mindlessly open apps on my phone and I'm like what am I doing you know and and I will say that if sounds overwhelming to set everything aside and have a brainstorming session some people are like what's that even mean it you don't have to go forward with always having a purpose to something and and that is something that I've learned as I've gotten older because you know what when I was younger and when I was a ski racer I couldn't just like go for a stroll right I have to do like intervals right sprinting for 30 seconds and then recovering and sprinting and recovering and all my friends were like you're crazy can you just come on a walk with us I'm like no actually I can't have to train and so now it's okay to just be right if you can figure out a way to just be so if you if you don't want to turn your phone off and do a brainstorming session for your job or you know for your business turn your phone off and just go for a walk or take a shower or you know if you like to paint paint just make space for you not to be so um turned on all the time because all of a sudden you will be on that walk with no intention of coming up with any ideas for your business and you will be like hey how did I not think of this sooner because all of a sudden your mind has the capacity to actually problem solve um and that's just burnout the grind culture doesn't allow it doesn't have that space so you got to make it I think that's perfectly said and great place for us to wrap what I would like to say for everyone listening is that Breckenridge is a town where people oftentimes have you know a condo that they go to visit and ski in or maybe they have a second home because they enjoy you know everything about that part of the country which it's like such a perfect sort of place um and and so this is an opportunity for anyone listening if you do have clients that love to ski or love to be outdoors and are looking in areas to maybe retire to or even have a second home you know Leah and her team would love the opportunity to connect with you um Leah or and of course if anyone's listening out there who is looking to purchase or or list a property in the Breckenridge in some county area I mean Leah and her team obviously are a great choice they are not only one of the top teams in the area their Leah and her team is literally one of the top agents in all of Coldwell Baker including not just this country but the entire world so if somebody out there is looking to connect with you and in some way Leah what's the best way that they should do that oh man you know here's the thing about being a REALTOR you could just look up my name and you will find all of my personal information so you it's pretty easy to find my phone number my website my email but yeah we can send everyone right over to the website which is
