[00:01:18] Today's episode is brought to you by corded.io.
[00:01:22] Are you looking for agents to join your brokerage team?
[00:01:26] Now, as a real estate recruiter, I can tell you the answer is always yes.
[00:01:30] But most agents aren't looking to move right now.
[00:01:33] So how do you know who to contact?
[00:01:35] Well, what if I were to tell you there's a recruiting and retention tool powered by
[00:01:39] artificial intelligence that shows you exactly which agents in your local market
[00:01:43] are looking to leave their brokerage right now and which agents at your own firm are also
[00:01:49] looking to leave you? Now, I've been recruiting REALTORS for 15 years and I've hired over 2000 agents.
[00:01:56] I can tell you with no exaggeration, this is the tool I've been waiting for.
[00:02:00] Corded's AI looks for trends across dozens of variables for each agent in your market
[00:02:05] and shows you which agents they believe are likely to move.
[00:02:08] Not only does it do that, but corded's AI went and visited my recruiting website
[00:02:13] and read everything I offer.
[00:02:15] So now when I'm recruiting, corded's AI tells me exactly what to say
[00:02:19] based on that agent's needs and what my brokerage can offer.
[00:02:23] It even writes emails for me.
[00:02:25] I've never seen anything like it and I use it every single day.
[00:02:29] Now, if you are looking to grow your brokerage, corded.io is the best tool out there.

[00:07:09] Well, also, please subscribe to Happy Agent podcast.
[00:07:12] That will also be in the show notes as well.
[00:07:15] You've got a lot going on, which is so exciting.
[00:07:17] 
[00:07:17] Things.
[00:07:18] Yes.
[00:07:19] So let's, yeah, let's get started.
[00:07:21] So tell me your stories.
[00:07:23] So how did you get into real estate?
[00:07:24] It was a happy circumstance.
[00:07:27] I was a senior in college at University of Maryland in 2004.
[00:07:32] And I was just looking to make money.
[00:07:35] I wanted to make six figures.
[00:07:37] And I had two job opportunities.
[00:07:38] So I could go into new construction sales with PULTY Homes,
[00:07:42] or I could sell drugs, legal ones, pharmaceuticals with Eli Lilly.
[00:07:47] And I opted to sell homes in the Metro DC area for PULTY Homes.
[00:07:51] So at the ripe age of 21, I was selling multimillion dollar
[00:07:56] mick mansions.
[00:07:57] And really, I look back and I had no business doing so.
[00:08:01] It's amazing.
[00:08:02] Like people were giving you their, you know, life savings in some cases,
[00:08:06] or not giving it to you, but trust me.
[00:08:08] No, it's so wild.
[00:08:09] Yes.
[00:08:09] It is.
[00:08:10] And because I think like would I give,
[00:08:13] you know, that sort of power to a 21, 22 year old,
[00:08:16] I don't know, probably not.
[00:08:18] I mean, I appreciate those agents that can do it.
[00:08:20] And I think it's great because it means you sort of trial by fire.
[00:08:23] Like if you can do it at that age, you could do it at an age, right?
[00:08:26] Oh, for sure.
[00:08:27] And it was such a great training ground for me because the company gave me
[00:08:30] really boot camp and real estate,
[00:08:32] mortgage construction sales.
[00:08:35] We were lean means selling machines.
[00:08:37] So when the market crashed in 2007, 2008,
[00:08:41] I transitioned over into general brokerage.
[00:08:43] And the Washington DC market first time buyers finally had a affordability coming back.
[00:08:48] So that was my niche.
[00:08:50] And I was able to sell 6 million my first years in agent and basically just
[00:08:55] rode that wave.
[00:08:56] And I bounced around from a big brokerage to a mid size to a boutique.
[00:09:00] And in 2011, I decided to open city chic real estate.
[00:09:05] Wow.
[00:09:06] Now what was the reason for opening your own firm?
[00:09:08] I guess you tried others and just couldn't find the right match.
[00:09:11] Yeah, really what it was was they were all so archaic and traditional.
[00:09:15] And I personally have a background in marketing and tech.
[00:09:18] So I started designing websites when I was 14.
[00:09:21] I got my bachelor's in marketing.
[00:09:23] And so for me, I really couldn't find the right fit of a brokerage that was able to support
[00:09:29] a millennial agent like me.
[00:09:31] And so I wanted to create a brokerage that you actually got something for your split.
[00:09:37] So they actually helped you with marketing and helped you be cutting edge in terms of technology.
[00:09:42] And they also just helped you run your business.
[00:09:44] And so that essentially was my mission in 2011 was create a brokerage that was just
[00:09:50] hyper supportive of their agents.
[00:09:52] So they could have a life.
[00:09:54] And that is my mission even today is that I want my agents to be top producers,
[00:09:58] but I don't want to take over their life.
[00:10:00] Yeah, and that's a difficult balancing act.
[00:10:02] We I think in particular women in particular, this is,
[00:10:06] you know, there's more women,
[00:10:07] REALTORS than there are.
[00:10:08] Yeah.
[00:10:08] Of course.
[00:10:09] And women have a tremendous number of responsibilities in more sort of traditional
[00:10:16] thoughts and norms.
[00:10:18] And they have to do a lot.
[00:10:19] And they're expected to do a lot.
[00:10:20] And it isn't easy to do any of it.
[00:10:22] And I think a spend could off a little easier than the women.
[00:10:25] But there's just a lot to juggle.
[00:10:27] There's family.
[00:10:28] There's children.
[00:10:29] There's your job.
[00:10:31] And there's also, of course, real estate happening all over the board.
[00:10:35] It doesn't just happen from nine to five, of course.
[00:10:37] So that is it is really tough to juggle.
[00:10:40] And that's one of the biggest challenges.
[00:10:41] I think any agent experiences when they get into the business sort of maybe
[00:10:45] not understanding that and how to set those boundaries and also how to succeed and do it.
[00:10:51] 
[00:10:52] So yeah, let's talk about how to create a since balance is impossible.
[00:10:58] A more close to balanced life.
[00:11:01] Because we could all use that.
[00:11:02] I think there's always, you know, rough, rough spots in anyone's business that could be smooth over.
[00:11:08] And it's usually about, you know, sort of tweaking little things here and there.
[00:11:12] So you do it through reverse engineering.
[00:11:15] So tell us about what reverse engineering is and why and how we can do it.
[00:11:20] So traditional business planning or traditional real estate advice tends to start with your business first.
[00:11:26] And so we kind of flip that on its head and we start with your life first.
[00:11:31] So we look at what kind of life do you want to have and what really makes you happy.
[00:11:37] What do you want your schedule to look like and then we back the business into that dream or
[00:11:43] that vision. So I have a three step process that I like to run clients through when we start,
[00:11:49] we have the exercise called start with joy and that's the free workbook that you guys can download.
[00:11:53] But the first step is all about doing your joy audit and your joy audit goes through your life
[00:12:00] and your business. So we're going to take a look at all of the admin tasks you do.
[00:12:04] All of your lead generation of marketing tasks that you do.
[00:12:08] All of the clients you have worked with in the past two to three years.
[00:12:12] And then we are going to rank all of them on enjoyment, not profit, not anything else,
[00:12:19] but it's how much did you enjoy it. So do you love that paperwork? Do you love social media?
[00:12:25] What do you love? And so from a one to ten, you are going to rank all of those different things.
[00:12:30] So I think post-it notes are a really good way to do this.
[00:12:32] And we're going to take a look at anything that is a seven to ten.
[00:12:37] So anything that ranges in your seven to ten zone, that's your zone of enjoyment.
[00:12:41] And that's usually where you're going to want to spend the most of your time because it's where
[00:12:46] you enjoy the business. And that's how you avoid burnout. Anything in the one to six range,
[00:12:53] you're going to see if you can delegate it or eliminate it or make it more enjoyable.
[00:12:57] And so that's basically your joy audit for your business. Now in your life,
[00:13:03] I think we forget oftentimes what we like doing. So we're going to go through and take a look at
[00:13:08] what people do you love to spend time with because I'm sure there are relationships that need
[00:13:12] some nurturing and that have slipped through the cracks because it definitely happens to all real
[00:13:17] state agents. How about activities or hobbies or things you actually enjoy doing? And so we're going
[00:13:23] to get that list together of the things you enjoy. And then you are going to design your ideal
[00:13:29] week. And we start with your personal things that you are non-negotiable and that you enjoy. So maybe
[00:13:35] it's my, no for me, my son's baseball games are number one on that list. Also, I am a daily
[00:13:43] meditator. That is absolutely on my schedule and I do not miss it for anything. So those things
[00:13:50] that really fill your cup and bring you happiness and bring you joy, you're making those
[00:13:54] non-negotiables. So going back to that reverse engineering, we're starting with joy first because
[00:14:00] that is the thing that oftentimes gets kicked to the curb the first.
[00:14:04] Yeah, so this would be sort of the opposite approach, which is what we normally do, which is what
[00:14:12] we start with our to-do's really even when we're designing even our business plan. We oftentimes
[00:14:17] start with our what do we have to do right now or in the next week or next month. And it really
[00:14:22] can get in the way because what's seemingly urgent and important in the moment isn't necessarily
[00:14:28] what's urgent and important long term. And so I love this idea of starting at the end and realizing
[00:14:34] hey, these are the things that are most, it reminds me of that saying, achieving to be happy
[00:14:42] versus happily achieving. So this idea that if once we get to X number of sales, then I'll be happy,
[00:14:50] then I'll take time for myself, then I will, once I do XY and Z, then I'll be and I hit whatever
[00:14:57] goals I'm hitting. By the way, I have never found that to be a good way to find happiness. I found
[00:15:03] that in most cases, I'm curious to get your thoughts. When you do achieve those goals, well, the
[00:15:07] things we think are going to lead us to the happiness oftentimes brings massive depression and
[00:15:13] massive sadness. Totally. Yes. It's kind of like this funny joke that doesn't really get talked
[00:15:19] about much. We all think about, you know, when one side at that very perfect weight or I have the
[00:15:25] certain amount of money in the bank, like that's when the happiness kicks in. And it hasn't really
[00:15:30] worked that way for me because because I guess it's just not how we're wired up. But I like this
[00:15:35] idea of starting at the things, the habits that make us happy because those are always guaranteed
[00:15:41] wins, right? So it's that journey versus the destination. So I love that. You're starting with
[00:15:47] the things like going to your Sunspace Ball game, meditating. Those are things that are guaranteed
[00:15:52] wins. They fill your cup and those are going to help you happily achieve. So I know I was a little
[00:15:57] bit all over the place there, but just kind of giving some thoughts around, you know, we should really
[00:16:01] move, I think more into direction than goals. Like I need, I want to head a certain direction.
[00:16:08] And I'm going to do all the things that I need to do to get there and hopefully do them in a way
[00:16:12] that's not going to drive me crazy. And there's probably no real destination. Yeah. That is a perfect
[00:16:18] segue into step number two, which is once we do our joy audit, we go into visioning. So we're going
[00:16:26] to craft your five to 10 year vision, depending on where you're at in your life and your career. So
[00:16:32] my five year vision back when I had my first child in 2025 was that I wanted to move from Washington,
[00:16:38] DC to my hometown in New Hampshire. And that was a five year plan that I had, I just knew in my heart,
[00:16:45] it was what I wanted. And I know we all have those dreams and we don't listen to them. And this one
[00:16:50] back in 2015, this was a crazy, crazy goal because how can you run a real estate brokerage remotely
[00:16:55] from New Hampshire? No one believed that I could, but I just knew it was so important to me that I was
[00:17:00] going to make it happen. And lo and behold, three and a half years later, I did, which is incredible.
[00:17:07] So right now in this phase of life, I want to be work optional by 50 years old. And so I'm putting
[00:17:14] in, it's a different goal, but I now have something else I'm working towards, which is meaningful for me.
[00:17:20] And I think that so often we get in the industry trap of I need to be number one on this list.
[00:17:26] I need 200 million in production, or I need three million in GCI that those,
[00:17:34] those numbers are great if there's a big Y behind them. But if there's not a Y behind them,
[00:17:39] they're completely meaningless. And I know people who make $80,000 a year and they are so incredibly
[00:17:45] happy because that income plays into a bigger Y for them. And I don't think more money would
[00:17:52] necessarily make them happier. And I think that we really need to ship the focus, but our industry
[00:17:58] makes it so hard because we've reward the wrong things. I really do. I think brokerages succeed
[00:18:04] when you make more money. And I think that they have an incentive to really work agents to death.
[00:18:13] And I just think that as real estate agents, you need to realize that that's happening. And social media
[00:18:19] plays into it. Everything plays into that bigger, better mentality. But when is it just enough
[00:18:25] for you to be happy? When is it just enough where you can have the life that you want?
[00:18:30] Yeah, I think that's really important. And for those of us that have earned more money than we
[00:18:35] thought we could in the past. And we see certainly more money when you don't have enough to do certain
[00:18:43] things that you want or need to do. Certainly it can bring happiness, of course, because it just
[00:18:48] brings peace of mind, maybe less anxiety, less fear, less stress. And to me that can result in
[00:18:55] happiness. But it's interesting when we look at the actual studies around happiness, I don't know
[00:18:59] what the most current data shows. But it's something like once you get over 100 and something
[00:19:05] thousand. Yeah, I think it's 120,000. Yeah. Yeah. Once you get over 120,000 and up to an infinite amount
[00:19:13] of money you could be making, your happiness level doesn't change all that much. It doesn't go down,
[00:19:18] but it doesn't necessarily rise to what you think it might. But that sort of rise from making almost
[00:19:25] nothing up to 120,000 is significant. And I guess that's probably because at that level, the mass
[00:19:30] majority of individual people, again, not not saying families, but maybe individual people can kind
[00:19:35] of pay their bills at that point. They can pay their bills. They're not super stressed. So yes, we want,
[00:19:39] we want, of course, to again, I want to make as much money as possible too. So I am not saying do not
[00:19:45] go for more more money because you can do a lot of wonderful things with money, including, but this
[00:19:50] goes back to Lindsay's point knowing your why, even if you just want to give it away, right, you can do
[00:19:55] that. You can do good with it or you can do good for your family or for yourself. Exactly. Yeah.
[00:20:00] Yeah. And I, there are agents that make millions of dollars and I, they're, they're happy,
[00:20:07] but they figured out how to create a business that doesn't take over their life. And they also have
[00:20:13] a meaningful purpose to what they're doing. And I just think that it takes a little while for you
[00:20:19] to figure that out in this industry. Like I had to reach a point of burnout for me to realize that
[00:20:23] I had to stop chasing more and more and more. And I had to start chasing what was important to me.
[00:20:29] And so I think that that's a really important reframe is what's important to you because if you're
[00:20:34] chasing the wrong stuff, you're just going to be miserable. How do you recommend somebody stays
[00:20:38] in touch with their why? Because it's so easy to put that behind in the back of our mind. It's
[00:20:45] so easy to just forget, you know, from time to time when we're hit with something immediate that
[00:20:49] seems urgent and important or you know, following the news, which is, you know, largely, you know,
[00:20:55] the created in a way to inflame, you know, our senses. So it's, it's, it's easy to knock us off our
[00:21:02] game, right? And certainly for me. So how would you recommend that I would should stay? What should I
[00:21:08] do to be able to keep the my wise, you know, in my purview? That's such a good question. And
[00:21:14] that takes me to the third step in starting with joy, which is you need to have three foundational
[00:21:21] pieces for your personal vision and for your professional, professional vision that you're working
[00:21:26] towards. So they're almost like micro goals of your broader goal, your five to 10 year vision.
[00:21:33] And revisiting that, I think that that can be really motivating. So for example,
[00:21:37] if I want to buy two multifamily investment properties, I know that I need $400,000 for a
[00:21:44] down payment to make that happen. I am able to then track where I'm at in that process. And that
[00:21:52] can be pretty motivating. So instead of it just being 400,000 in a vacuum, it's okay, that 400,000
[00:21:58] is going to get me to those two multifamilies, which are then going to provide me with 150,000
[00:22:04] of passive income, which is getting me closer to that goal of being work optional by 50 years old.
[00:22:09] And also going backwards from the 400,000, you can kind of just do the math, right? You can easily see,
[00:22:15] this is, you know, this is my average, you know, commission per deal. This is, you know, and you can
[00:22:21] kind of work back and then it's, okay, well, how many appointments do you need to get a client and
[00:22:25] how many people do you need to reach out to? And so you can chunk it down so granularly that you know
[00:22:31] every day I have to focus on these three, four habits and, you know, there's a pretty predictable path
[00:22:37] there. Exactly. Yeah, it makes it motivating. So instead of just, I need to make $400,000. Yeah,
[00:22:45] it's like, now I need 10 appointments this week or I need to have 50 conversations this week to
[00:22:50] make this happen. So it really is more motivating. But I also think that helps you stay on track. So
[00:22:57] it's not just, this doesn't live in a vacuum. You don't do it once like most business plans.
[00:23:02] It's you really have that vision and it really needs to mean something to you. And then you need to
[00:23:06] hold yourself accountable, whether that's yourself or a friend or a family member or coach. But you
[00:23:11] need to have someone who's like, all right, you said you wanted to do this. These are the three
[00:23:15] micro steps or the three micro goals you're working towards. How are we doing? Hitting those.
[00:23:20] Yeah, let's talk about accountability because I think I personally think that this is one of the
[00:23:27] biggest opportunities for agents to really consider implementing. We all kind of know what we should be
[00:23:33] doing. I mean, if we've been in the business long enough, we know, you know, we should know
[00:23:38] specifically what we're doing. But even if you don't have it down, you sort of know you should be
[00:23:41] reaching out to clients. You should be deepening relationships, meeting new people, putting
[00:23:45] in your database, like setting out CMAs. Like there's, there's things we know to do. And having
[00:23:50] accountability for me is the only thing that works for me. I would love to say that I am so
[00:23:56] disciplined that I hold myself accountable for every part of my life. And did I just get things done?
[00:24:02] Boy, I don't. And most of these funny, I actually, this is funny. You'll get a kick out of this. I did
[00:24:08] a gallop does this. They call it a key strength finder. And they list 34 strengths. It's amazing.
[00:24:15] I encourage everybody to do this. It's like costs like 30 or 40 dollars. And it will tell you exactly
[00:24:19] what your best at and what your weakest at. And they will tell you, don't even try your weakest stuff
[00:24:23] because it's not gonna happen. My 33rd out of 34th skill. So like the second from my least,
[00:24:31] second least, you know, accomplished skill was discipline. And people tell me they think I'm so
[00:24:36] disciplined. The reality is I just have a lot of accountability. I don't have discipline. I wish
[00:24:41] I did. I wish I didn't need people. I have somebody waking me up every morning at 5 or at 6 a.m.
[00:24:47] And then I wake myself up at 5.55 so she doesn't actually have to make the phone call because that
[00:24:50] gets me to do it because I don't really want her to have to call me. I'm 48 years old. I feel like
[00:24:54] a little embarrassed about that. So I went, I set my alarm in 5.55 and that will get me up because I'm
[00:24:59] like, I don't want her to have to call me. So that's accountability. And it sounds silly maybe to
[00:25:04] others or maybe it sounds smart to others. I'm not sure, but it gets it done. And so I think,
[00:25:09] let's talk about accountability. How do you recommend people set up accountability?
[00:25:14] I think there are so many ways, but the first is you just have to know yourself and you know
[00:25:21] yourself. And I love this phone call. It's like, I don't want the shame of having somebody wake me
[00:25:27] up at 6 o'clock. So I'm going to wake myself up. So a little embarrassing. Yeah. No, it's not embarrassing.
[00:25:32] I think it's great. I'm sort of I'm sort of tongue in cheek about it. But my point is the reason
[00:25:38] why it works for me and also I think this is important to understand. It's not actually paying
[00:25:44] somebody do it's because in my mind, that's some have to do that for me. So because of that,
[00:25:51] because of that, because of your wire earlier, so that you have to have to pick up the phone and
[00:25:58] actually make that dot do that. So again, it's just how I'm wired. So you should know how kind of
[00:26:04] ability helps or doesn't help you. Right. So I think accountability can be systems. It can be
[00:26:13] technology. It can be people. And I think it's anything that you want to stick to in terms of
[00:26:19] your goals. You need to figure out an accountability system for those. And so I know for me, my employees
[00:26:26] act like my accountability a lot of the time because they are like, I need this from you Lindsay.
[00:26:30] Like you need to make this happen. And so anything that makes you do something that you don't
[00:26:36] want to do, that's accountability. And so it can be your phone. It can be a person. It could be a
[00:26:42] CRM. It could literally be body doubling on a zoom with somebody. But just making it happen is what
[00:26:49] accountability is all about. I think it's really the missing piece that a lot of us, you know,
[00:26:57] if we think about in a coach, right? And this goes into coaching. How do these partners are
[00:27:03] think of professional eats? They all have a coach. They all, they know they all people help
[00:27:08] and I'm a medical athlete that does it all themselves. They all have a team of helping them. So
[00:27:15] again, accountability partners, we probably need them too. Exactly. There's no shame in that game.
[00:27:21] Like to get to a certain level, you have to have help. And I think that that's another hard
[00:27:27] piece for real estate agents to understand is that you don't have to do it all by yourself. And
[00:27:31] most top producing agents don't. They have a support team that they've built around them and
[00:27:35] accountability is a piece of that. So you've understood, figured out what
[00:27:43] brings us the most habits we need to cultivate. And we have one of the
[00:27:54] these pieces that actually start with that. Then where are we at?
[00:28:02] You're breaking up. Oh, I'm sorry. There.
[00:28:08] There we go. Hold on to you there. Okay.
[00:28:14] Are we still here? Yes.
[00:28:19] Oh, okay. Sorry. We will think that. Can you hear me? Okay.
[00:28:23] Now it's a little bit better. Hello.
[00:28:28] A little bit. Okay.
[00:28:29] 
[00:28:35] With our end. That is very unusual.
[00:28:41] Okay. Am I coming through any better? Yes. That's much better. Nope. That's better.
[00:28:46] Because sorry. Let's go back. So
[00:28:49] wait, hold on. Oh, did you just lose me again? Yes.
[00:28:58] Oh, technology.
[00:29:07] Let's see. Should be good.
[00:29:10] Okay. Yes. What I can do is I can switch my up.
[00:29:14] I think so. Yeah. I think I got you.
[00:29:16] Or do okay. Sorry. I will fix that.
[00:29:22] I will interlitch there. We can hear you. Okay.
[00:29:27] I hear you. I hear you. Now let's hope it sticks.
[00:29:31] Okay. Let's try it. All right. So let us know sort of where we're at now in the process.
[00:29:36] Okay. So we had follow the joy, which was your joy audit.
[00:29:40] So we're going through ranking everything we're doing from one to 10 and seven or more.
[00:29:45] That's your enjoyment zone. So that's where you're going to enjoy the business, the most,
[00:29:48] which is just an important piece to know. The next is you're casting your five to 10-year joy
[00:29:53] vision. So what does your life and business look like in five to 10 years? What are your goals?
[00:29:58] Where do you want to get to? And then the last piece is your found three foundational microgoles
[00:30:04] underneath your life and business joy vision. And then it's staying accountable or putting in
[00:30:10] pieces to your business that you need to make it happen. So maybe you need to hire an assistant.
[00:30:15] Maybe you need to get a buyer's agent on your team. Maybe you need to get a new CRM.
[00:30:20] Maybe you need to really focus on your lead generation or marketing to get to that goal.
[00:30:24] So it's all about then that's your business plan. And so I find again so many agents do it
[00:30:30] backwards where they start with a number that they want to achieve, but they're not reverse
[00:30:34] engineering it by starting with joy, starting with their life goals first. And that's ultimately,
[00:30:42] I have seen so many agents in this business burn out hate their life just absolutely
[00:30:49] flame into the ground and the ones that don't do that practice this. They really are so good
[00:30:57] at knowing why they're doing what they're doing and then optimizing their business for their
[00:31:02] lifestyle and for the time and energy that they do have to invest in their business.
[00:31:07] But their life isn't doesn't get the leftovers. Like their life is always first, whether that's
[00:31:13] your friends, your family, yourself. But it's like that they always come first. And DJ, I'm not
[00:31:19] going to say it's easy. It literally is so hard. Like it is a muscle you have to flex by putting
[00:31:24] yourself first and your needs first. But the more you practice those boundaries, the more you
[00:31:31] really start to put yourself and your time first. It comes easier and it's not it's very uncomfortable
[00:31:38] at first. It's going to feel really weird to tell people that you're not available on a Sunday.
[00:31:42] When you really want to be available on that Sunday because you know you're probably can
[00:31:46] assault something. But maybe you have again a buyer's agent or licensed assistant who can
[00:31:53] step in for you on that Sunday. So once you start setting those boundaries, you can then fill it
[00:31:58] in with the support that you need to make sure you hold those boundaries firm.
[00:32:02] Yeah, I think that's a really, really solid point. Again, happy agent.co is where you can go to
[00:32:08] start this process. The start with Joy workbook is available. It's free. It's right on her website.
[00:32:13] We also have a link to that in the show notes. But yeah, I think you're right. There's this idea of
[00:32:20] really just again, being intentional. It sounds like we're really talking about his intentionality.
[00:32:26] How do we actually structure our day? How do we structure our week? Instead of just letting
[00:32:31] things happen, because again, the market's going to do what it does and our leads are kind of
[00:32:36] kind of do what they do. And our people in our database are going to either use us or they won't.
[00:32:41] And yes, we can influence that and we should and we should be doing all of the behaviors. But
[00:32:46] if we certainly don't have control over a lot of what actually ends up happening other than our
[00:32:51] habits and our behaviors. So I love that we're starting with what we think is going to make us the
[00:32:57] happiest and then getting all the way down to, okay, what are the daily tasks I need to do? And
[00:33:03] can I get some of these off my plate? For those of us thinking, I can't afford that. I can't
[00:33:07] afford to hire an assistant. I can't afford, I will tell you, I have an assistant and I can't
[00:33:13] afford an assistant in the traditional sense. Yet, I have a wonderful assistant. So there are ways
[00:33:19] to do this that are a lot less expensive than you might consider. There are people all over the
[00:33:24] world that are wanting to help you in your business and they have time and they have different needs
[00:33:29] than you. And so they will tell you what they charge and you can find people that are competitive
[00:33:33] and hopefully are within your budget. Yes, exactly. And also you don't necessarily have to pay them
[00:33:39] right away. So with a buyer's agent or a licensed assistant or someone around in that realm,
[00:33:45] they could be have a cut of your deal. So they're getting paid when you have a closing. And that's
[00:33:49] how I started scaling initially was I didn't pay anybody. I just had somebody who was licensed
[00:33:54] to want it to learn the business and wanted to help me. And I was cutting them in on my deals.
[00:33:59] So it doesn't have to cost you money right away. You can get creative. But usually you're hiring
[00:34:05] before you feel comfortable. Have spending the money. But I will tell you it helps you leverage
[00:34:12] so much more quickly. And also I don't think I've ever regretted spending money on leverage.
[00:34:19] Yeah, me neither. It's certainly. And also understanding like what's our hourly value? That's
[00:34:24] another wonderful exercise to really think about, you know, what did you make last year? What was
[00:34:28] your hourly wage depending on how many hours you chose to work? And then also understanding, again,
[00:34:34] I know we're not necessarily starting with the outcome of just money. But figuring out what is my
[00:34:38] hourly wage? If I were to do the number of deals realistically that would stretch, stretched,
[00:34:44] but realistically stretched, what would what would my hourly wage approximately be? And then from
[00:34:50] there, figuring out what tasks am I doing that are really not sort of worth that time because
[00:34:59] that time's valuable. So, you know, if it's better for me to go on Facebook and start messaging
[00:35:04] people and connecting with them and on LinkedIn and liking their posts and calling people that are
[00:35:09] in my life and just checking in on them, if that's actually what generates business, then maybe the
[00:35:14] paperwork side of it could be offloaded to someone else who because that isn't generating the income
[00:35:19] that I'm looking for, it's helping to get a deal closed. And I also think you said something
[00:35:23] really important, which is very, I very rarely hear people say this and I'm so glad you mentioned it,
[00:35:28] which is I can't afford to hire an assistant. You're like, what if you just cut them in on your deals?
[00:35:32] You know, you said, hey, I've got these tasks that I'm not particularly strong at or I just need to
[00:35:37] do other things. If you do these for me, I will give you a cut of, you know, every deal that you work on.
[00:35:42] I think that is as simple as that sounds. That is not how a lot of agents think. So, you know,
[00:35:48] agents think in terms of teams, like if you're on a team, you get a certain cut, but, you know,
[00:35:52] as far as getting some help for other tasks, this is a really, really solid idea. I love that.
[00:35:58] It's also like the market shifting and it's really wonky in a lot of places. So there are agents that
[00:36:04] need the income and if you need the help, it's a win-win for both of them.
[00:36:10] Yeah, I agree. I want to shift gears. I want to ask two questions and I meant to do this at the very
[00:36:15] beginning and I'm going to see if we can catch this into the very beginning because I think this is
[00:36:19] always a fun way to start and I just wasn't thinking and I didn't get it done, but we'll do it now.
[00:36:24] So a question, two questions are and these, you don't know they're coming. So this will be really fun.
[00:36:29] No pressure, of course, just, you know, we expect the perfect answers here. So good luck.
[00:36:33] Oh, me, no, no, they're very, they're, they're, they're, if you need a moment or two to think about it,
[00:36:38] too, no big deal, I can, I can talk, but what's the best piece of advice you ever heard as an agent?
[00:36:45] Oh, I'm so glad you asked this. Okay, so the best, this came from my mentor and over 10 years ago
[00:36:52] and he said, if it is a seven out of 10, ship it, I suffer from perfectionism syndrome and he
[00:37:01] is like, Lindsay, your seven is like everybody else is 10. So if it is a seven out of 10, just get it
[00:37:07] out into the world. Stop overthinking it, stop messing around with it and just ship it. That was
[00:37:12] game-changing advice for this perfectionist because when I find myself over analyzing or getting
[00:37:18] in the weeds on something, I ask, is it a seven out of 10? And normally it is a seven out of 10,
[00:37:22] and I just need to stop tinkering with it. I have the same affliction with certain things,
[00:37:28] other things not, but certain things like my website for repeating, I want it to be the very best
[00:37:34] that that exists and, you know, I want, and of course it can never be fully finished because
[00:37:39] there's always new things to add to it or so yeah, I got you. Yeah, and my boss will say, okay,
[00:37:45] enough, let's just get it up. It's better than 99% of the ones out there. It's not to your
[00:37:49] perfect standard, but it's pretty good yet. Anything that's a seven and a seven and above
[00:37:54] ship it, let's get it out there, let's get it done and we can always refine it later. So,
[00:37:59] Amen. Yep. Absolutely agree with you. Now, here's another question, what's the worst piece of advice
[00:38:04] you ever received as an agent? That there is one prescriptive way to generate business, and I have
[00:38:14] had some very bad coaches in my past 21 years, and I can't tell you how many of them were just like
[00:38:24] make your calls. And I think that that works for a certain type of person and a certain type of
[00:38:32] clientele, but I think that there is not just one size fits all when it comes to marketing and
[00:38:38] lead generation. And I think that that was probably some really bad advice I got because I got
[00:38:43] really discouraged early on in the business because I didn't like any of the activities that
[00:38:49] coach was making me do. And later down the road, I realized that or I learned that there's four
[00:38:55] types of lead generation personalities. And it totally made sense that I didn't resonate with these
[00:39:02] coaches because they were trying to put me in the prospector box and I'm not a prospector. I'm a
[00:39:06] marketer and I'm a converter. And so it was very eye opening for me, but that was some of my worst
[00:39:12] advice was that you need to do this, you need to do this, and it just again going back to building
[00:39:17] a business you love, you have to love the activities you're doing. Yeah, let's teach our audience
[00:39:22] something as you being a millennial would can attest to. And again, this isn't everybody, we're just
[00:39:28] going to generalize, but let's say do millennials like getting phone calls? Are you joking? No.
[00:39:35] And actually what I've realized, and this is kind of related but unrelated, is that I love
[00:39:40] getting voice notes. Yeah. And that is the new phone call to me. I will drop voice notes to my
[00:39:46] agents. I'll drop voice notes to clients, but voice notes are a personal way to touch base with
[00:39:53] somebody without doing the weird intrusiveness of a phone call. So whether it's in the Instagram DMs,
[00:39:59] voice notes or in attacks, it's I feel like millennials don't hate phone calls. We want to hear the
[00:40:05] voice to voice, but it's like we want it to be asynchronous. We don't want to necessarily be on
[00:40:10] the phone with you. Right. We want right now. Here's a question. Voice notes or video notes.
[00:40:17] I like either. I think like either is great. So if you like being on video,
[00:40:22] not care, so I'd like go for it. If you don't want to be on video, I think voice notes are just as
[00:40:26] personal. I love that. Now millennials are the going, you know, they are the largest market right now
[00:40:32] to, you know, potentially buy their first home, their buying homes later. We know that as well. They're
[00:40:37] starting later than previous generations. Late 30s. Now it's about 38 years old. So how would you
[00:40:44] recommend somebody start to communicate with a millennial just to start of the relationship and
[00:40:52] maybe the education process of why this may make sense? How do you think? How do you see that working?
[00:40:58] I think it depends on how they come into your orbit. So we still get people who inquire through our
[00:41:05] website and with those people, our agents will send a calendar link for an initial consultation via
[00:41:11] Zoom. So they're picking time that works for them and then we run through our buyer presentation,
[00:41:16] like teach them about buyer agency, how agents are compensated, all that good stuff, and then
[00:41:21] basically schedule their tour and get them pre-approved and all that. So if they're coming to us,
[00:41:26] we're usually scheduling the consultation right away. Sometimes it's sphere referral, a lot of
[00:41:32] time it's referral and that's a similar process, but a lot of times we're either doing it online via
[00:41:38] Zoom or we're going in person casual coffee date kind of vibe. So I think the biggest thing with the
[00:41:45] millennial demographic is that they're looking for expertise, but they're also looking for authenticity.
[00:41:51] We can smell a faker or somebody who's a phony or just in it for the commission a mile away.
[00:41:58] I can smell commission breath like so badly and I know that millennials can feel that too. So we
[00:42:05] don't want someone who's just putting on a show. We want someone who really puts our interest first,
[00:42:10] which I think is why so much of our business is referral because most of our clients are older
[00:42:15] millennials or I would say like the 35 to 45 demographic, but they're just looking for someone who's
[00:42:22] really has their interest at heart and they're really looking for someone who genuinely wants to help
[00:42:26] them through this process. And I think that lends itself to active listening and for those of us that are
[00:42:34] really looking to up our communication game learn active listening. It's not difficult to learn. It's hard to
[00:42:39] practice. Well it's not too it's not hard to develop a great habit to it, but it'll be hard at first.
[00:42:44] But this is really important. If you want people to sort of feel that you're authentic,
[00:42:49] you have to authentically be interested in them. And that you have to learn how to ask them about
[00:42:55] them and that's a skill as well. And you can find Google videos or sorry YouTube videos. There's
[00:43:00] courses. You probably teach this as well. And you're in your coaching and your different products.
[00:43:05] There are so many ways to learn this, but learn how to get into somebody's sort of
[00:43:12] expassion. Like what are they interested in? Why is it important to them? They're what they're why.
[00:43:17] And if you do that, what you I think what you end up realizing is there's not much competition
[00:43:22] in that particular way. You know, there's definitely better REALTORS and there's people who are
[00:43:27] successful. But when you really take time to get to know somebody and beyond the transaction
[00:43:32] and understanding why the transactions important to them and what they're looking to do and what
[00:43:37] they're vision, what they're five year vision is what do you want to do? How do you want this
[00:43:40] home to look in five years? And you know, doing those kind of things, you think we think all agents do
[00:43:45] that. Most agents don't. They just go, oh, you want to buy home? Cool. Tell me what you want. And I'll
[00:43:49] go find it for you. I have a great example of this literally a couple days ago. I had a woman
[00:43:54] who is downsizing into a condo. And we were having a discussion and I said, do you do realize that
[00:44:00] this building is a walk up and there's no elevator, right? Because I knew she was aging in place.
[00:44:05] And it's like I'd listen to what she was looking for. She wants us to be her last home forever.
[00:44:10] And she's like, no, I had no idea. I had no elevator. I went and I'm like, no, it has no elevator.
[00:44:15] So I don't think this is going to be the right fit for you. And she was so thrilled that I told her
[00:44:22] not to buy this house because it didn't fit her long-term goals because she then referred me to two more
[00:44:27] people. So when you really listen to what it's like the undercurrent, she didn't say, I need an elevator.
[00:44:35] But in my mind, I knew if she's aging here eventually she's probably not going to be able to walk
[00:44:39] upstairs. And so you really have to listen in such a good point you say, like listen, listen,
[00:44:45] listen. It's there it is not hard, but it is so incredibly valuable.
[00:44:51] Yeah, it's way more important than what you say. It's just way more important. It just ultimately gives
[00:44:56] you all the information or most of the information that you need to connect with somebody. And people
[00:45:01] want to feel connected to, especially not just millennials, of course, all generations. People
[00:45:05] want to feel important. They want to feel heard, respected, listened to. And that is, you know, when
[00:45:11] we walk into a store, or at least this is my experience, we walk into like a clothing store. And the
[00:45:15] salesperson comes immediately up like, what does that feel? Does not feel good to me? And it's not
[00:45:20] because there's anything wrong with a salesperson at a clothing store. That's what they should be doing.
[00:45:24] But they should be coming up to me and somehow talking to me. But we all know how it feels when
[00:45:30] they just are clearly looking to make that sale versus saying, hey, let's talk about your lifestyle.
[00:45:35] Like what kind of clothing do you think you're looking for? Because I can go, you just start browsing.
[00:45:40] I'm going to come up with some ideas for you. You know, there's good, there's great people who do
[00:45:44] it. And I get it. Restaurants do this too. I always ask, what's the best thing on the menu?
[00:45:48] Right. I'm sitting down. And yeah. And then, and then I'll say, hey, this is what we're thinking
[00:45:53] of ordering. Did we make any mistakes here? And they'll tell you, right? And so it's about, I want,
[00:45:59] I want expertise, like you were saying. And I want somebody who's who's going to listen to what I
[00:46:04] want. And so I think these are great suggestions. Let's talk about your podcast. So tell us about,
[00:46:09] tell us about the happy agent podcast. So the happy agent called podcast is really focused on
[00:46:16] helping women in real estate build a business that they love. And you
[00:46:22] intro the podcast, this podcast with women have different demands. And it is definitely
[00:46:29] well known that women typically carry most of the mental load when it comes to home life.
[00:46:35] And I know that men are working on it. And we're trying to like, you know, make things better.
[00:46:39] But I will also add with the, we're like the sandwich generation where we're taking care of our
[00:46:44] parents as well as taking care of kids. So that load is very, very, very big. So we talk about
[00:46:52] basically how to, it's all of the things around being a woman in real estate. So it could be
[00:46:58] you're how to manage your time, how to manage your energy, how to implement more strategies that
[00:47:04] make your life more happy and meaningful, how to streamline your systems, how to attract clients
[00:47:10] in a way that's authentically you. So really just trying to make a business that normally makes you

[00:47:22] have to do in your life. I love it. So happy agent podcast. We have a link to that in the show notes.

That will also be in the show notes as well. You've got a lot going on, which is so exciting. Things. Yes. So let's, yeah, let's get started. So tell me your stories. So how did you get into real estate? It was a happy circumstance. I was a senior in college at University of Maryland in 2004. And I was just looking to make money. I wanted to make six figures. And I had two job opportunities. So I could go into new construction sales with PULTY Homes, or I could sell drugs, legal ones, pharmaceuticals with Eli Lilly. And I opted to sell homes in the Metro DC area for PULTY Homes. So at the ripe age of 21, I was selling multimillion dollar mick mansions. And really, I look back and I had no business doing so. It's amazing. Like people were giving you their, you know, life savings in some cases, or not giving it to you, but trust me. No, it's so wild. Yes. It is. And because I think like would I give, you know, that sort of power to a 21, 22 year old, I don't know, probably not. I mean, I appreciate those agents that can do it. And I think it's great because it means you sort of trial by fire. Like if you can do it at that age, you could do it at an age, right? Oh, for sure. And it was such a great training ground for me because the company gave me really boot camp and real estate, mortgage construction sales. We were lean means selling machines. So when the market crashed in 2007, 2008, I transitioned over into general brokerage. And the Washington DC market first time buyers finally had a affordability coming back. So that was my niche. And I was able to sell 6 million my first years in agent and basically just rode that wave. And I bounced around from a big brokerage to a mid size to a boutique. And in 2011, I decided to open city chic real estate. Wow. Now what was the reason for opening your own firm? I guess you tried others and just couldn't find the right match. Yeah, really what it was was they were all so archaic and traditional. And I personally have a background in marketing and tech. So I started designing websites when I was 14. I got my bachelor's in marketing. And so for me, I really couldn't find the right fit of a brokerage that was able to support a millennial agent like me. And so I wanted to create a brokerage that you actually got something for your split. So they actually helped you with marketing and helped you be cutting edge in terms of technology. And they also just helped you run your business. And so that essentially was my mission in 2011 was create a brokerage that was just hyper supportive of their agents. So they could have a life. And that is my mission even today is that I want my agents to be top producers, but I don't want to take over their life. Yeah, and that's a difficult balancing act. We I think in particular women in particular, this is, you know, there's more women, REALTORS than there are. Yeah. Of course. And women have a tremendous number of responsibilities in more sort of traditional thoughts and norms. And they have to do a lot. And they're expected to do a lot. And it isn't easy to do any of it. And I think a spend could off a little easier than the women. But there's just a lot to juggle. There's family. There's children. There's your job. And there's also, of course, real estate happening all over the board. It doesn't just happen from nine to five, of course. So that is it is really tough to juggle. And that's one of the biggest challenges. I think any agent experiences when they get into the business sort of maybe not understanding that and how to set those boundaries and also how to succeed and do it. So yeah, let's talk about how to create a since balance is impossible. A more close to balanced life. Because we could all use that. I think there's always, you know, rough, rough spots in anyone's business that could be smooth over. And it's usually about, you know, sort of tweaking little things here and there. So you do it through reverse engineering. So tell us about what reverse engineering is and why and how we can do it. So traditional business planning or traditional real estate advice tends to start with your business first. And so we kind of flip that on its head and we start with your life first. So we look at what kind of life do you want to have and what really makes you happy. What do you want your schedule to look like and then we back the business into that dream or that vision. So I have a three step process that I like to run clients through when we start, we have the exercise called start with joy and that's the free workbook that you guys can download. But the first step is all about doing your joy audit and your joy audit goes through your life and your business. So we're going to take a look at all of the admin tasks you do. All of your lead generation of marketing tasks that you do. All of the clients you have worked with in the past two to three years. And then we are going to rank all of them on enjoyment, not profit, not anything else, but it's how much did you enjoy it. So do you love that paperwork? Do you love social media? What do you love? And so from a one to ten, you are going to rank all of those different things. So I think post-it notes are a really good way to do this. And we're going to take a look at anything that is a seven to ten. So anything that ranges in your seven to ten zone, that's your zone of enjoyment. And that's usually where you're going to want to spend the most of your time because it's where you enjoy the business. And that's how you avoid burnout. Anything in the one to six range, you're going to see if you can delegate it or eliminate it or make it more enjoyable. And so that's basically your joy audit for your business. Now in your life, I think we forget oftentimes what we like doing. So we're going to go through and take a look at what people do you love to spend time with because I'm sure there are relationships that need some nurturing and that have slipped through the cracks because it definitely happens to all real state agents. How about activities or hobbies or things you actually enjoy doing? And so we're going to get that list together of the things you enjoy. And then you are going to design your ideal week. And we start with your personal things that you are non-negotiable and that you enjoy. So maybe it's my, no for me, my son's baseball games are number one on that list. Also, I am a daily meditator. That is absolutely on my schedule and I do not miss it for anything. So those things that really fill your cup and bring you happiness and bring you joy, you're making those non-negotiables. So going back to that reverse engineering, we're starting with joy first because that is the thing that oftentimes gets kicked to the curb the first. Yeah, so this would be sort of the opposite approach, which is what we normally do, which is what we start with our to-do's really even when we're designing even our business plan. We oftentimes start with our what do we have to do right now or in the next week or next month. And it really can get in the way because what's seemingly urgent and important in the moment isn't necessarily what's urgent and important long term. And so I love this idea of starting at the end and realizing hey, these are the things that are most, it reminds me of that saying, achieving to be happy versus happily achieving. So this idea that if once we get to X number of sales, then I'll be happy, then I'll take time for myself, then I will, once I do XY and Z, then I'll be and I hit whatever goals I'm hitting. By the way, I have never found that to be a good way to find happiness. I found that in most cases, I'm curious to get your thoughts. When you do achieve those goals, well, the things we think are going to lead us to the happiness oftentimes brings massive depression and massive sadness. Totally. Yes. It's kind of like this funny joke that doesn't really get talked about much. We all think about, you know, when one side at that very perfect weight or I have the certain amount of money in the bank, like that's when the happiness kicks in. And it hasn't really worked that way for me because because I guess it's just not how we're wired up. But I like this idea of starting at the things, the habits that make us happy because those are always guaranteed wins, right? So it's that journey versus the destination. So I love that. You're starting with the things like going to your Sunspace Ball game, meditating. Those are things that are guaranteed wins. They fill your cup and those are going to help you happily achieve. So I know I was a little bit all over the place there, but just kind of giving some thoughts around, you know, we should really move, I think more into direction than goals. Like I need, I want to head a certain direction. And I'm going to do all the things that I need to do to get there and hopefully do them in a way that's not going to drive me crazy. And there's probably no real destination. Yeah. That is a perfect segue into step number two, which is once we do our joy audit, we go into visioning. So we're going to craft your five to 10 year vision, depending on where you're at in your life and your career. So my five year vision back when I had my first child in 2025 was that I wanted to move from Washington, DC to my hometown in New Hampshire. And that was a five year plan that I had, I just knew in my heart, it was what I wanted. And I know we all have those dreams and we don't listen to them. And this one back in 2015, this was a crazy, crazy goal because how can you run a real estate brokerage remotely from New Hampshire? No one believed that I could, but I just knew it was so important to me that I was going to make it happen. And lo and behold, three and a half years later, I did, which is incredible. So right now in this phase of life, I want to be work optional by 50 years old. And so I'm putting in, it's a different goal, but I now have something else I'm working towards, which is meaningful for me. And I think that so often we get in the industry trap of I need to be number one on this list. I need 200 million in production, or I need three million in GCI that those, those numbers are great if there's a big Y behind them. But if there's not a Y behind them, they're completely meaningless. And I know people who make $80,000 a year and they are so incredibly happy because that income plays into a bigger Y for them. And I don't think more money would necessarily make them happier. And I think that we really need to ship the focus, but our industry makes it so hard because we've reward the wrong things. I really do. I think brokerages succeed when you make more money. And I think that they have an incentive to really work agents to death. And I just think that as real estate agents, you need to realize that that's happening. And social media plays into it. Everything plays into that bigger, better mentality. But when is it just enough for you to be happy? When is it just enough where you can have the life that you want? Yeah, I think that's really important. And for those of us that have earned more money than we thought we could in the past. And we see certainly more money when you don't have enough to do certain things that you want or need to do. Certainly it can bring happiness, of course, because it just brings peace of mind, maybe less anxiety, less fear, less stress. And to me that can result in happiness. But it's interesting when we look at the actual studies around happiness, I don't know what the most current data shows. But it's something like once you get over 100 and something thousand. Yeah, I think it's 120,000. Yeah. Yeah. Once you get over 120,000 and up to an infinite amount of money you could be making, your happiness level doesn't change all that much. It doesn't go down, but it doesn't necessarily rise to what you think it might. But that sort of rise from making almost nothing up to 120,000 is significant. And I guess that's probably because at that level, the mass majority of individual people, again, not not saying families, but maybe individual people can kind of pay their bills at that point. They can pay their bills. They're not super stressed. So yes, we want, we want, of course, to again, I want to make as much money as possible too. So I am not saying do not go for more more money because you can do a lot of wonderful things with money, including, but this goes back to Lindsay's point knowing your why, even if you just want to give it away, right, you can do that. You can do good with it or you can do good for your family or for yourself. Exactly. Yeah. Yeah. And I, there are agents that make millions of dollars and I, they're, they're happy, but they figured out how to create a business that doesn't take over their life. And they also have a meaningful purpose to what they're doing. And I just think that it takes a little while for you to figure that out in this industry. Like I had to reach a point of burnout for me to realize that I had to stop chasing more and more and more. And I had to start chasing what was important to me. And so I think that that's a really important reframe is what's important to you because if you're chasing the wrong stuff, you're just going to be miserable. How do you recommend somebody stays in touch with their why? Because it's so easy to put that behind in the back of our mind. It's so easy to just forget, you know, from time to time when we're hit with something immediate that seems urgent and important or you know, following the news, which is, you know, largely, you know, the created in a way to inflame, you know, our senses. So it's, it's, it's easy to knock us off our game, right? And certainly for me. So how would you recommend that I would should stay? What should I do to be able to keep the my wise, you know, in my purview? That's such a good question. And that takes me to the third step in starting with joy, which is you need to have three foundational pieces for your personal vision and for your professional, professional vision that you're working towards. So they're almost like micro goals of your broader goal, your five to 10 year vision. And revisiting that, I think that that can be really motivating. So for example, if I want to buy two multifamily investment properties, I know that I need $400,000 for a down payment to make that happen. I am able to then track where I'm at in that process. And that can be pretty motivating. So instead of it just being 400,000 in a vacuum, it's okay, that 400,000 is going to get me to those two multifamilies, which are then going to provide me with 150,000 of passive income, which is getting me closer to that goal of being work optional by 50 years old. And also going backwards from the 400,000, you can kind of just do the math, right? You can easily see, this is, you know, this is my average, you know, commission per deal. This is, you know, and you can kind of work back and then it's, okay, well, how many appointments do you need to get a client and how many people do you need to reach out to? And so you can chunk it down so granularly that you know every day I have to focus on these three, four habits and, you know, there's a pretty predictable path there. Exactly. Yeah, it makes it motivating. So instead of just, I need to make $400,000. Yeah, it's like, now I need 10 appointments this week or I need to have 50 conversations this week to make this happen. So it really is more motivating. But I also think that helps you stay on track. So it's not just, this doesn't live in a vacuum. You don't do it once like most business plans. It's you really have that vision and it really needs to mean something to you. And then you need to hold yourself accountable, whether that's yourself or a friend or a family member or coach. But you need to have someone who's like, all right, you said you wanted to do this. These are the three micro steps or the three micro goals you're working towards. How are we doing? Hitting those. Yeah, let's talk about accountability because I think I personally think that this is one of the biggest opportunities for agents to really consider implementing. We all kind of know what we should be doing. I mean, if we've been in the business long enough, we know, you know, we should know specifically what we're doing. But even if you don't have it down, you sort of know you should be reaching out to clients. You should be deepening relationships, meeting new people, putting in your database, like setting out CMAs. Like there's, there's things we know to do. And having accountability for me is the only thing that works for me. I would love to say that I am so disciplined that I hold myself accountable for every part of my life. And did I just get things done? Boy, I don't. And most of these funny, I actually, this is funny. You'll get a kick out of this. I did a gallop does this. They call it a key strength finder. And they list 34 strengths. It's amazing. I encourage everybody to do this. It's like costs like 30 or 40 dollars. And it will tell you exactly what your best at and what your weakest at. And they will tell you, don't even try your weakest stuff because it's not gonna happen. My 33rd out of 34th skill. So like the second from my least, second least, you know, accomplished skill was discipline. And people tell me they think I'm so disciplined. The reality is I just have a lot of accountability. I don't have discipline. I wish I did. I wish I didn't need people. I have somebody waking me up every morning at 5 or at 6 a.m. And then I wake myself up at 5.55 so she doesn't actually have to make the phone call because that gets me to do it because I don't really want her to have to call me. I'm 48 years old. I feel like a little embarrassed about that. So I went, I set my alarm in 5.55 and that will get me up because I'm like, I don't want her to have to call me. So that's accountability. And it sounds silly maybe to others or maybe it sounds smart to others. I'm not sure, but it gets it done. And so I think, let's talk about accountability. How do you recommend people set up accountability? I think there are so many ways, but the first is you just have to know yourself and you know yourself. And I love this phone call. It's like, I don't want the shame of having somebody wake me up at 6 o'clock. So I'm going to wake myself up. So a little embarrassing. Yeah. No, it's not embarrassing. I think it's great. I'm sort of I'm sort of tongue in cheek about it. But my point is the reason why it works for me and also I think this is important to understand. It's not actually paying somebody do it's because in my mind, that's some have to do that for me. So because of that, because of that, because of your wire earlier, so that you have to have to pick up the phone and actually make that dot do that. So again, it's just how I'm wired. So you should know how kind of ability helps or doesn't help you. Right. So I think accountability can be systems. It can be technology. It can be people. And I think it's anything that you want to stick to in terms of your goals. You need to figure out an accountability system for those. And so I know for me, my employees act like my accountability a lot of the time because they are like, I need this from you Lindsay. Like you need to make this happen. And so anything that makes you do something that you don't want to do, that's accountability. And so it can be your phone. It can be a person. It could be a CRM. It could literally be body doubling on a zoom with somebody. But just making it happen is what accountability is all about. I think it's really the missing piece that a lot of us, you know, if we think about in a coach, right? And this goes into coaching. How do these partners are think of professional eats? They all have a coach. They all, they know they all people help and I'm a medical athlete that does it all themselves. They all have a team of helping them. So again, accountability partners, we probably need them too. Exactly. There's no shame in that game. Like to get to a certain level, you have to have help. And I think that that's another hard piece for real estate agents to understand is that you don't have to do it all by yourself. And most top producing agents don't. They have a support team that they've built around them and accountability is a piece of that. So you've understood, figured out what brings us the most habits we need to cultivate. And we have one of the these pieces that actually start with that. Then where are we at? You're breaking up. Oh, I'm sorry. There. There we go. Hold on to you there. Okay. Are we still here? Yes. Oh, okay. Sorry. We will think that. Can you hear me? Okay. Now it's a little bit better. Hello. A little bit. Okay. With our end. That is very unusual. Okay. Am I coming through any better? Yes. That's much better. Nope. That's better. Because sorry. Let's go back. So wait, hold on. Oh, did you just lose me again? Yes. Oh, technology. Let's see. Should be good. Okay. Yes. What I can do is I can switch my up. I think so. Yeah. I think I got you. Or do okay. Sorry. I will fix that. I will interlitch there. We can hear you. Okay. I hear you. I hear you. Now let's hope it sticks. Okay. Let's try it. All right. So let us know sort of where we're at now in the process. Okay. So we had follow the joy, which was your joy audit. So we're going through ranking everything we're doing from one to 10 and seven or more. That's your enjoyment zone. So that's where you're going to enjoy the business, the most, which is just an important piece to know. The next is you're casting your five to 10-year joy vision. So what does your life and business look like in five to 10 years? What are your goals? Where do you want to get to? And then the last piece is your found three foundational microgoles underneath your life and business joy vision. And then it's staying accountable or putting in pieces to your business that you need to make it happen. So maybe you need to hire an assistant. Maybe you need to get a buyer's agent on your team. Maybe you need to get a new CRM. Maybe you need to really focus on your lead generation or marketing to get to that goal. So it's all about then that's your business plan. And so I find again so many agents do it backwards where they start with a number that they want to achieve, but they're not reverse engineering it by starting with joy, starting with their life goals first. And that's ultimately, I have seen so many agents in this business burn out hate their life just absolutely flame into the ground and the ones that don't do that practice this. They really are so good at knowing why they're doing what they're doing and then optimizing their business for their lifestyle and for the time and energy that they do have to invest in their business. But their life isn't doesn't get the leftovers. Like their life is always first, whether that's your friends, your family, yourself. But it's like that they always come first. And DJ, I'm not going to say it's easy. It literally is so hard. Like it is a muscle you have to flex by putting yourself first and your needs first. But the more you practice those boundaries, the more you really start to put yourself and your time first. It comes easier and it's not it's very uncomfortable at first. It's going to feel really weird to tell people that you're not available on a Sunday. When you really want to be available on that Sunday because you know you're probably can assault something. But maybe you have again a buyer's agent or licensed assistant who can step in for you on that Sunday. So once you start setting those boundaries, you can then fill it in with the support that you need to make sure you hold those boundaries firm. Yeah, I think that's a really, really solid point. Again, happy agent.co is where you can go to start this process. The start with Joy workbook is available. It's free. It's right on her website. We also have a link to that in the show notes. But yeah, I think you're right. There's this idea of really just again, being intentional. It sounds like we're really talking about his intentionality. How do we actually structure our day? How do we structure our week? Instead of just letting things happen, because again, the market's going to do what it does and our leads are kind of kind of do what they do. And our people in our database are going to either use us or they won't. And yes, we can influence that and we should and we should be doing all of the behaviors. But if we certainly don't have control over a lot of what actually ends up happening other than our habits and our behaviors. So I love that we're starting with what we think is going to make us the happiest and then getting all the way down to, okay, what are the daily tasks I need to do? And can I get some of these off my plate? For those of us thinking, I can't afford that. I can't afford to hire an assistant. I can't afford, I will tell you, I have an assistant and I can't afford an assistant in the traditional sense. Yet, I have a wonderful assistant. So there are ways to do this that are a lot less expensive than you might consider. There are people all over the world that are wanting to help you in your business and they have time and they have different needs than you. And so they will tell you what they charge and you can find people that are competitive and hopefully are within your budget. Yes, exactly. And also you don't necessarily have to pay them right away. So with a buyer's agent or a licensed assistant or someone around in that realm, they could be have a cut of your deal. So they're getting paid when you have a closing. And that's how I started scaling initially was I didn't pay anybody. I just had somebody who was licensed to want it to learn the business and wanted to help me. And I was cutting them in on my deals. So it doesn't have to cost you money right away. You can get creative. But usually you're hiring before you feel comfortable. Have spending the money. But I will tell you it helps you leverage so much more quickly. And also I don't think I've ever regretted spending money on leverage. Yeah, me neither. It's certainly. And also understanding like what's our hourly value? That's another wonderful exercise to really think about, you know, what did you make last year? What was your hourly wage depending on how many hours you chose to work? And then also understanding, again, I know we're not necessarily starting with the outcome of just money. But figuring out what is my hourly wage? If I were to do the number of deals realistically that would stretch, stretched, but realistically stretched, what would what would my hourly wage approximately be? And then from there, figuring out what tasks am I doing that are really not sort of worth that time because that time's valuable. So, you know, if it's better for me to go on Facebook and start messaging people and connecting with them and on LinkedIn and liking their posts and calling people that are in my life and just checking in on them, if that's actually what generates business, then maybe the paperwork side of it could be offloaded to someone else who because that isn't generating the income that I'm looking for, it's helping to get a deal closed. And I also think you said something really important, which is very, I very rarely hear people say this and I'm so glad you mentioned it, which is I can't afford to hire an assistant. You're like, what if you just cut them in on your deals? You know, you said, hey, I've got these tasks that I'm not particularly strong at or I just need to do other things. If you do these for me, I will give you a cut of, you know, every deal that you work on. I think that is as simple as that sounds. That is not how a lot of agents think. So, you know, agents think in terms of teams, like if you're on a team, you get a certain cut, but, you know, as far as getting some help for other tasks, this is a really, really solid idea. I love that. It's also like the market shifting and it's really wonky in a lot of places. So there are agents that need the income and if you need the help, it's a win-win for both of them. Yeah, I agree. I want to shift gears. I want to ask two questions and I meant to do this at the very beginning and I'm going to see if we can catch this into the very beginning because I think this is always a fun way to start and I just wasn't thinking and I didn't get it done, but we'll do it now. So a question, two questions are and these, you don't know they're coming. So this will be really fun. No pressure, of course, just, you know, we expect the perfect answers here. So good luck. Oh, me, no, no, they're very, they're, they're, they're, if you need a moment or two to think about it, too, no big deal, I can, I can talk, but what's the best piece of advice you ever heard as an agent? Oh, I'm so glad you asked this. Okay, so the best, this came from my mentor and over 10 years ago and he said, if it is a seven out of 10, ship it, I suffer from perfectionism syndrome and he is like, Lindsay, your seven is like everybody else is 10. So if it is a seven out of 10, just get it out into the world. Stop overthinking it, stop messing around with it and just ship it. That was game-changing advice for this perfectionist because when I find myself over analyzing or getting in the weeds on something, I ask, is it a seven out of 10? And normally it is a seven out of 10, and I just need to stop tinkering with it. I have the same affliction with certain things, other things not, but certain things like my website for repeating, I want it to be the very best that that exists and, you know, I want, and of course it can never be fully finished because there's always new things to add to it or so yeah, I got you. Yeah, and my boss will say, okay, enough, let's just get it up. It's better than 99% of the ones out there. It's not to your perfect standard, but it's pretty good yet. Anything that's a seven and a seven and above ship it, let's get it out there, let's get it done and we can always refine it later. So, Amen. Yep. Absolutely agree with you. Now, here's another question, what's the worst piece of advice you ever received as an agent? That there is one prescriptive way to generate business, and I have had some very bad coaches in my past 21 years, and I can't tell you how many of them were just like make your calls. And I think that that works for a certain type of person and a certain type of clientele, but I think that there is not just one size fits all when it comes to marketing and lead generation. And I think that that was probably some really bad advice I got because I got really discouraged early on in the business because I didn't like any of the activities that coach was making me do. And later down the road, I realized that or I learned that there's four types of lead generation personalities. And it totally made sense that I didn't resonate with these coaches because they were trying to put me in the prospector box and I'm not a prospector. I'm a marketer and I'm a converter. And so it was very eye opening for me, but that was some of my worst advice was that you need to do this, you need to do this, and it just again going back to building a business you love, you have to love the activities you're doing. Yeah, let's teach our audience something as you being a millennial would can attest to. And again, this isn't everybody, we're just going to generalize, but let's say do millennials like getting phone calls? Are you joking? No. And actually what I've realized, and this is kind of related but unrelated, is that I love getting voice notes. Yeah. And that is the new phone call to me. I will drop voice notes to my agents. I'll drop voice notes to clients, but voice notes are a personal way to touch base with somebody without doing the weird intrusiveness of a phone call. So whether it's in the Instagram DMs, voice notes or in attacks, it's I feel like millennials don't hate phone calls. We want to hear the voice to voice, but it's like we want it to be asynchronous. We don't want to necessarily be on the phone with you. Right. We want right now. Here's a question. Voice notes or video notes. I like either. I think like either is great. So if you like being on video, not care, so I'd like go for it. If you don't want to be on video, I think voice notes are just as personal. I love that. Now millennials are the going, you know, they are the largest market right now to, you know, potentially buy their first home, their buying homes later. We know that as well. They're starting later than previous generations. Late 30s. Now it's about 38 years old. So how would you recommend somebody start to communicate with a millennial just to start of the relationship and maybe the education process of why this may make sense? How do you think? How do you see that working? I think it depends on how they come into your orbit. So we still get people who inquire through our website and with those people, our agents will send a calendar link for an initial consultation via Zoom. So they're picking time that works for them and then we run through our buyer presentation, like teach them about buyer agency, how agents are compensated, all that good stuff, and then basically schedule their tour and get them pre-approved and all that. So if they're coming to us, we're usually scheduling the consultation right away. Sometimes it's sphere referral, a lot of time it's referral and that's a similar process, but a lot of times we're either doing it online via Zoom or we're going in person casual coffee date kind of vibe. So I think the biggest thing with the millennial demographic is that they're looking for expertise, but they're also looking for authenticity. We can smell a faker or somebody who's a phony or just in it for the commission a mile away. I can smell commission breath like so badly and I know that millennials can feel that too. So we don't want someone who's just putting on a show. We want someone who really puts our interest first, which I think is why so much of our business is referral because most of our clients are older millennials or I would say like the 35 to 45 demographic, but they're just looking for someone who's really has their interest at heart and they're really looking for someone who genuinely wants to help them through this process. And I think that lends itself to active listening and for those of us that are really looking to up our communication game learn active listening. It's not difficult to learn. It's hard to practice. Well it's not too it's not hard to develop a great habit to it, but it'll be hard at first. But this is really important. If you want people to sort of feel that you're authentic, you have to authentically be interested in them. And that you have to learn how to ask them about them and that's a skill as well. And you can find Google videos or sorry YouTube videos. There's courses. You probably teach this as well. And you're in your coaching and your different products. There are so many ways to learn this, but learn how to get into somebody's sort of expassion. Like what are they interested in? Why is it important to them? They're what they're why. And if you do that, what you I think what you end up realizing is there's not much competition in that particular way. You know, there's definitely better REALTORS and there's people who are successful. But when you really take time to get to know somebody and beyond the transaction and understanding why the transactions important to them and what they're looking to do and what they're vision, what they're five year vision is what do you want to do? How do you want this home to look in five years? And you know, doing those kind of things, you think we think all agents do that. Most agents don't. They just go, oh, you want to buy home? Cool. Tell me what you want. And I'll go find it for you. I have a great example of this literally a couple days ago. I had a woman who is downsizing into a condo. And we were having a discussion and I said, do you do realize that this building is a walk up and there's no elevator, right? Because I knew she was aging in place. And it's like I'd listen to what she was looking for. She wants us to be her last home forever. And she's like, no, I had no idea. I had no elevator. I went and I'm like, no, it has no elevator. So I don't think this is going to be the right fit for you. And she was so thrilled that I told her not to buy this house because it didn't fit her long-term goals because she then referred me to two more people. So when you really listen to what it's like the undercurrent, she didn't say, I need an elevator. But in my mind, I knew if she's aging here eventually she's probably not going to be able to walk upstairs. And so you really have to listen in such a good point you say, like listen, listen, listen. It's there it is not hard, but it is so incredibly valuable. Yeah, it's way more important than what you say. It's just way more important. It just ultimately gives you all the information or most of the information that you need to connect with somebody. And people want to feel connected to, especially not just millennials, of course, all generations. People want to feel important. They want to feel heard, respected, listened to. And that is, you know, when we walk into a store, or at least this is my experience, we walk into like a clothing store. And the salesperson comes immediately up like, what does that feel? Does not feel good to me? And it's not because there's anything wrong with a salesperson at a clothing store. That's what they should be doing. But they should be coming up to me and somehow talking to me. But we all know how it feels when they just are clearly looking to make that sale versus saying, hey, let's talk about your lifestyle. Like what kind of clothing do you think you're looking for? Because I can go, you just start browsing. I'm going to come up with some ideas for you. You know, there's good, there's great people who do it. And I get it. Restaurants do this too. I always ask, what's the best thing on the menu? Right. I'm sitting down. And yeah. And then, and then I'll say, hey, this is what we're thinking of ordering. Did we make any mistakes here? And they'll tell you, right? And so it's about, I want, I want expertise, like you were saying. And I want somebody who's who's going to listen to what I want. And so I think these are great suggestions. Let's talk about your podcast. So tell us about, tell us about the happy agent podcast.
