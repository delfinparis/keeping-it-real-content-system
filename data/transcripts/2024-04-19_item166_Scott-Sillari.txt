[00:04:00] DJ what what a intro. Thank you so much for having me
[00:04:03] I'm super excited to be here and you know just
[00:04:06] Educate and offer some value to your audience
[00:04:09] Yeah, I'm excited. Thank you. So yeah, thank you and really I'm super excited about this because I love
[00:04:16] Products that integrate with other products and this is what it is
[00:04:21] I'm almost not that I would have ever been able to start this company
[00:04:24] But I kicking myself for not having the idea and you and your team obviously have built this incredible
[00:04:30] platform and basically
[00:04:32] Let's just before we dive right in let's get a little bit into your background
[00:04:36] So I mentioned a little bit about your past
[00:04:38] But tell us about how you got started at real sync and what was what were you what are you trying to solve there?
[00:04:45] And where did you come from?
[00:04:46] Yeah, so
[00:04:49] You know
[00:04:50] What kind of start my past that when I got back working with you know business
[00:04:56] You know real estate businesses and consulting
[00:04:59] I became an executive at viral marketing. That's where I kind of spoke to thousands of different clients
[00:05:04] And then one of the one of my partners from that
[00:05:08] You know, we were talking and had this idea. It was like man. There's
[00:05:11] There's all these new technologies coming out. There's nothing to connect them and
[00:05:16] he had sent
[00:05:18] Almost a million dollars on building out sales force and realized he still didn't have all the applications and solutions that he needed for his real estate business
[00:05:28] Because it's not really possible to build this all in one solution
[00:05:31] And because there's always new technologies coming you need something that connects and so we had this idea of
[00:05:36] You know, we we start looking around and there's a company called mule soft
[00:05:40] Which I don't know if you know people outside of the real estate space have heard of but
[00:05:45] They I think they sold to sales force for like six billion dollars a couple years ago
[00:05:51] But basically there's these in other industries there's these middleware platforms that build API to API integrations
[00:05:57] But there was nothing in real estate you were you're pre-limited the zappier and at the time when we started this zappier didn't have a lot of
[00:06:06] Available integrations within the real estate sector in itself right it was in a lot of other industries now
[00:06:12] It's expanded and it's an amazing tool
[00:06:14] But that's kind of how we got started we started you know traveling around going to the different like the in-mins and
[00:06:21] Talking to different software companies like follow boss and boom time
[00:06:25] We literally helped boom time build their API because at the time in 2017 2018 a
[00:06:31] Lot of these technologies, you know had their solutions that the users using
[00:06:36] But there was no external API and the API is the way you connect one app to another right that's kind of where you
[00:06:44] You know where you fast in the bridge on both sides right to keep it non-technical
[00:06:51] And so we were helping some of these different companies like build out their APIs
[00:06:55] As we were building out our solution
[00:06:58] And then you know we specifically were like you know what we want to be a residential real estate agent team broker solution
[00:07:05] where we're
[00:07:06] Connecting to just apps that you'd be using to enable your business to automate and grow right
[00:07:13] Yeah, it's it's a really amazing idea because we do this in other areas of our life if you've ever used
[00:07:21] If this than that that's a common one where you can connect lots of different apps together
[00:07:26] Not mostly not real estate related stuff like social media and other other
[00:07:31] Other technologies, but that's always a fun one to play with
[00:07:34] But this idea that apps can communicate is really important because you said something that I think every one of our listeners
[00:07:41] Can agree with probably was nodding their heads is everybody every
[00:07:45] You know tech firm is like we've got the all-in-one solution
[00:07:48] Well, they probably don't right nobody is yet really built all-in-one solution
[00:07:52] So the odds are you probably have multiple different tech
[00:07:57] providers for your business, you know you have some something for email you have something for your CRM
[00:08:03] Maybe you have a different website provider
[00:08:04] Maybe you have a lead source generator
[00:08:06] Maybe you have a place your buying leads from and you need these
[00:08:10] Systems to really talk to one another otherwise you're logging in and out of all these different systems
[00:08:15] I know it our firm here we
[00:08:18] We have six different systems when an agent joins us that we connect them to
[00:08:21] Well nobody wants to log in and out of six systems
[00:08:24] But that's how it works right now and so we need a tool like this so that they can talk so tell us like what does real sync actually do?
[00:08:33] Yeah, so
[00:08:35] So we have a our actual
[00:08:38] SaaS platform is a proprietary integration platform that we built basically the handle data from multiple
[00:08:45] systems and then you know source and targets send it back and forth right based on certain triggers that happen
[00:08:51] There's certain ways that you work within that system
[00:08:54] One of the biggest things that we talk to agents about is like and you just mentioned that DJ is
[00:08:59] When you bring on new agent like there's six systems
[00:09:02] it's like
[00:09:03] Man just to get them to behave in the way that you want to get into the CRM and update it
[00:09:10] Let alone they have to go then log into five different systems and update the same data or make sure
[00:09:15] They're getting the data out of one or another it's
[00:09:18] It just doesn't happen right? It's just a it's a very complicated thing to to and you don't want your agents really doing that either
[00:09:25] I mean how much time they're wasting having to do that right? So that's where we fit in is you know, we go all right if
[00:09:32] You know if you generate a lead to an inbox
[00:09:35] Rather than having to copy and paste that data
[00:09:38] This is a very basic one that a lot of people struggle with still and I get out in a call all the time is like
[00:09:43] You know you can set up a mail parser for you
[00:09:46] So automates the lead data basically scrapes the data and puts it in the CRM and then we can set up automation the CRM to apply a tag
[00:09:53] A follow-up task
[00:09:55] It can we can assign it to a certain agent depending on what you want or it can be you know
[00:10:00] Into a pond or around rob and depending depending on how you have your CRM set up
[00:10:04] So just that one thing right there
[00:10:07] All of a sudden you're like oh my god, I can sleep at night knowing my leads are just flowing into my CRM
[00:10:12] Right, that's just one example
[00:10:15] And then you start all the different systems you're talking about you know your your email
[00:10:19] Maybe avoid our phone solution like you know call rail dial pad
[00:10:25] Transaction management sky slope dock you sign dot loop. Yeah, you know broker meant alone wolf like all these different solutions that
[00:10:32] You may be using maybe your broker requires you to use certain solutions
[00:10:38] That and and so now you're you have your own personalized tech stack that you're trying to marry with the brokers tech stack
[00:10:44] And it just becomes very overwhelming and complicated and there's a lot of inefficiencies and that's what we fit in our solutions meant
[00:10:50] To integrate all these different solutions now we don't integrate to every app
[00:10:54] I wish I could say we did right now
[00:10:56] But our road map is to as we've been building our new solution
[00:11:00] It's much more scalable for us to add applications quickly
[00:11:03] So that you can come the real thing can go oh my god, they have like all seven of the apps I'm using and I can
[00:11:09] Click click click click click and set up filters and yeah make it all work, you know it's it's
[00:11:16] You know, it's even so much cooler than than that to me because it and yes, that's a great explanation
[00:11:22] I want everybody to do this it not when you if you're driving don't do this right now
[00:11:27] But if you're not driving go to real sync.com and again
[00:11:30] Real s-y-n-c-h.com go to their integrations and just look at the sheer number of different
[00:11:38] Real estate tech services that they connect with I guarantee some of your products or services that every one of our listeners use are in here
[00:11:47] Even if it's just I use Google email. I use Google Calendar. It's in here every
[00:11:51] Everything I mean you say you don't do with everyone, but just about everyone and if you see a tool that isn't in here
[00:12:00] Reach out to Scott and his team and they can consider adding it to their platform
[00:12:03] But basically the way I like to think about these tools is you get let get to let your creativity kind of run wild because now that these
[00:12:12] These integrations are happening and these systems can talk to one another. I always like to say wouldn't it be cool if
[00:12:18] Right and so that's that's what this system does like wouldn't it be cool if every time somebody comes in for an open house
[00:12:25] That lead that I capture on my tablet or wherever goes automatically into my CRM it automatically maybe gets an email
[00:12:33] Maybe there's some text maybe the
[00:12:35] This these this is real sync can connect all the different apps to make this happen
[00:12:40] Yeah, absolutely and one of the things you mentioned too is if like this step back if you come to our platform
[00:12:46] You don't see an app sure we may be able to add it
[00:12:48] But also we have a services part of our business where we'll just
[00:12:51] Find a solution that already connects with it like Zapier is much more expansive now or make
[00:12:57] Yep gets complicated right, but
[00:12:59] We can go and just do it for you as well, which is something that I really
[00:13:05] Love that we offer that part of it part of the business because
[00:13:09] So many times it's like you have this idea and you're like man
[00:13:13] I wish I can just do this and that and like maybe we just haven't created that solution yet
[00:13:17] But we can still try to figure it out for you which is fantastic and
[00:13:22] You're right. It shifts the way you think about technology
[00:13:25] You start thinking about what processes do I have in my business
[00:13:31] That I can maybe add some automation or tech to
[00:13:35] Knowing that there's a company like ours out there to help you make the connection
[00:13:41] Right, so a lot of times just like this idea
[00:13:43] But now you can go you know what I can actually do it
[00:13:46] And so I always tell tell team owners
[00:13:48] Instead of just going and grabbing the shiny new technology
[00:13:52] Step back and think about like what's the life cycle from the time the lead is generated
[00:13:56] Until you're putting it on a nurture campaign after it closes
[00:14:01] And what do you want to happen
[00:14:03] Everything in between whether it's like internal type of system things or towards the consumer
[00:14:09] Or some of the vendors that you know all that different stuff you can think about and then
[00:14:14] Go all right. I need a tech tool for this one part of this process
[00:14:19] It probably exists already we can go find it and add it and connect it, you know
[00:14:23] Yeah, and I also love the fact that your team will also say hey, we don't have that
[00:14:28] But we can give you an idea about how to get this done on make.com or or
[00:14:33] Zapier or if this than that
[00:14:35] There's there are and by the way I subscribe to make.com and because it was the only one that could do this one thing
[00:14:41] That I needed it to do and boy
[00:14:43] I would love to have had your services at that time because
[00:14:47] It is complicated and I'm a pretty tech savvy person and I was struggling
[00:14:52] I am still struggling with make but it's it's cool
[00:14:55] But these guys what I love that you do is you have the ability to just take all these tools get them to talk to one another
[00:15:01] And then you as the agent get to figure out what do you want you get to design your customer experience
[00:15:07] And then leveraging the tools you already have you're just gonna have them talk to one another so there isn't duplication of effort
[00:15:14] You're not going into one system and then another system and another system everything's working in sync
[00:15:20] I but I know you guys are working on a new product too. Can you share anything about your your new
[00:15:26] Development I didn't know that's a wrap's around no no absolutely we can um and
[00:15:31] To reiterate what you just said to before I share yeah
[00:15:36] Yeah, like
[00:15:39] Maximizing the tools you have so many times it's like oh, I gotta go get this other tool right DJ and it's like
[00:15:44] Well, let's look at how we can make sure that everything's efficient automated maximize
[00:15:49] And integrated with what you have before you decide to go get a different tool because you're never really gonna know
[00:15:55] If this tool is perfect for your business or not if you're not using it right so I always recommend that as well
[00:16:01] You know um
[00:16:02] But yeah, man our our new solution. I'm so excited about so
[00:16:08] One of the one of the parents parent one of the big issues that we've had is the way our original platform was built
[00:16:14] It would take us a long time to add another app to the whole suite of apps right so
[00:16:20] Anywhere from like four to six weeks, which is just way too long
[00:16:24] It's just impossible to keep up because new technology is coming out like this right
[00:16:29] Um, so we went on this road map of you know what we need to rebuild our common model how we handle data
[00:16:34] So that we can add an application to our entire suite of apps within two to three days
[00:16:39] Wow, which is what we're doing what what we're doing now when we release the new app so very exciting
[00:16:44] So what it's gonna do is you know that integration page you see right now is gonna
[00:16:50] You know, that's gonna turn from that to you know 150 200 apps over the next year very quickly
[00:16:57] So that really we can say hey we connect to everything that a real estate a residential real estate company
[00:17:03] broker agent would need in their business right and then
[00:17:07] While we were doing that we we were looking and going you know what like
[00:17:12] We're aggregating all this data
[00:17:14] how do we help
[00:17:16] give
[00:17:17] actionable insights
[00:17:19] To our clients that are connecting to our platform. Yeah, so we built our own app real syncs app to where you can connect the follow-up boss or
[00:17:28] Sierra or a boomtown
[00:17:30] Hopefully a brividi
[00:17:32] Syncs when I'm gonna be one of our partners color Williams commands
[00:17:35] Give me one of our partner like we have all these different partners lined up just waiting for us to enable them
[00:17:40] And what it's gonna do
[00:17:42] Is it's gonna allow you to see what's happening in your business
[00:17:47] from an agent activity perspective a volume and sales perspective a lead source ROI perspective
[00:17:56] And just those all that comprehensively and then give you actual insight
[00:18:01] To identify like where the holes are what where do you need to make improvements? What's actually going on your business because
[00:18:08] I've talked to all these different CRM's and the one thing that they are willing to admit is the reporting is not great with a lot of these solutions
[00:18:15] So we're gonna bring it all in where you can connect
[00:18:18] Not just CRM but transaction management. You can connect the
[00:18:22] The lead gen solutions you can connect quick books online like all these different accounting solutions
[00:18:27] So all this data is aggregating and then we're breaking it down is showing you what is most important so you can make those decisions
[00:18:34] Yeah, I love that so you're not just facilitating the communication from one app to another which is amazing and automating a lot of
[00:18:43] Manual processes that we're doing now, but now you're saying hey, by the way since we're passing all this data back and forth
[00:18:49] Let's go ahead and figure out a way to give the end user the REALTOR some
[00:18:53] Some reasons some insight into this data that they can use to actually further their relationships they have with their clients or
[00:19:01] You know and and so I love this does AI play any role in some of the data analysis is AI going to give people like
[00:19:10] Some reason to say hey, we noticed this thing. We want you to reach out for this reason
[00:19:14] Yeah, so and initially no I feel like people just use the term AI when it's not really AI like there's a lot of
[00:19:23] You know if then type
[00:19:26] Data where we're looking at ratios and what they should be and and so you we're gonna get a lot inside like that
[00:19:31] Notifying the owner like hey, you're your conversion for this particular agent from the time they meet in appointment to sign
[00:19:38] Is much lower than the industry average and then eventually we'll have our own averages as we're aggregating data right
[00:19:45] Part of a roadmap though is to add in some AI solutions
[00:19:49] uh, I can't really get into that too much, but it's gonna help you facilitate
[00:19:55] Taking action, which is the biggest thing yep that people get stuck on is like hey all of a sudden
[00:20:01] I gave you like hey there's these 20 leads and haven't been touched that came in and haven't been touching the first 24 hours
[00:20:08] You should probably call them and then they agents like oh, I don't have time and then they can maybe hit a button
[00:20:14] And we we do the calling for them something like that right?
[00:20:17] It's kind of the the roadmap that we're going, but that would be I think you know we're talking
[00:20:23] There's a lot of phases so that'd be something early next year maybe but like that's kind of the idea where
[00:20:27] Where the actionable insights were giving you
[00:20:33] We can also
[00:20:35] Do it for you and that's the wow
[00:20:37] Yeah, well even just getting the actionable insights is incredible because if I'm an agent and I'm wearing every hat
[00:20:46] That I have to wear because I'm a business owner. I'm also
[00:20:50] You know the agent. I'm also my own marketing team. I'm my customer service team and um, you know
[00:20:56] Everything else that REALTORS do psychologists sometimes
[00:20:59] Um, they play a lot of different roles and it's tough and it's hard and it's not always easy to take a step back and analyze this data
[00:21:08] And by the way the same skill set that's good at interpersonal effectiveness like the person to person eyeball to eyeball stuff
[00:21:16] Is not the same skill set that's good at interpreting data right like those are two very different skills and usually different personality types
[00:21:23] So you might be really great at I'm the face-to-face person everyone I meet loves me and wants to hang out with me
[00:21:29] But I don't really have a good sense of what my close ratio is or what my appointment to list ratio is or you know
[00:21:36] How many people do I meet have to meet next year that I don't yet know to hit my my goals
[00:21:42] You have
[00:21:44] Tools that will actually be able to interpret this data and give you actionable insights of like hey, we noticed this
[00:21:50] And that I think is so super cool. Yeah, it's super it's super exciting DJ. We're so stoked about it
[00:21:57] You've been working on it for about a year and um, yeah, and you know also like with that that team owner you just mentioned
[00:22:05] You know like a lot of times it's very tough to put on a sales manager hat if you've hired some agents too
[00:22:11] And especially if you're in production still man. There's just it's just so many different jobs right and technology can really help
[00:22:19] If you add the right thing tools right and you understand where you need to pull the levers and I think a lot of times
[00:22:25] There just isn't that visibility and that's what we're trying to solve is that like you're adding these different solutions
[00:22:32] But you don't know how to maximize um, you don't know if it's really something you need you just adding it because
[00:22:37] Someone else told you to use it
[00:22:40] And you may not know if it's even helping your business. We really want to give you
[00:22:44] A really good visibility into your own business through the window where you can see everything happening
[00:22:49] And go oh, I should pull that lever, you know, yeah, that that lead source here is gonna give me more return
[00:22:55] This thing you know what I mean and things like that where it's like very
[00:23:00] You know, we're coming from a place where we've you know my business partner runs a huge real estate team and
[00:23:05] Um, you know a lot of insight from them, but a lot of insight from our great clients that we've worked with
[00:23:09] I'm like what they're looking for and we're trying to really bring that to the table. Yeah
[00:23:14] Yeah, it's funny. I was I'm kind of going through a process like this myself and I think our audience will
[00:23:20] Can relate to this so
[00:23:22] We I recruit REALTORS is my day job that that's what I do here at kale realty and yeah
[00:23:27] One of the things that's always been a challenge for us is there aren't a lot of good recruiting
[00:23:31] REALTOR solutions. They're just aren't um, there's a few but there's not very many players in the space and which is kind of surprising
[00:23:38] But anyway, I ended up going for our CRM for our recruiters not for our agents
[00:23:44] Just our people who recruit REALTORS we went with Zoho because they're very open and they have a big open
[00:23:49] Platform it's it's really very impressive and
[00:23:53] They and then I wanted to connect all of my other apps to Zoho and Zoho is is pretty pretty flexible with that
[00:23:59] I will tell you it is so and this is not a knock at Zoho. It's just how integration is so complicated
[00:24:06] It is so difficult for me to integrate all of my different apps with Zoho
[00:24:11] I cannot tell you this sheer amount of hours
[00:24:15] I have put into get my VoIP system with with texting in there my
[00:24:19] Calendly, which is how I schedule appointments in there. It's not that easy and I love that you guys make it easy
[00:24:26] Because I needed something like this sadly it was before I met you
[00:24:31] But I cannot tell you the and everybody can relate to this even guys even if you're just thinking
[00:24:37] How do I connect my my Google account to X to my to this other
[00:24:43] Product I have to real geeks or or whatever CRM
[00:24:48] Yes
[00:24:49] There's ways to do this real sync and even help you just sync up your calendar even so
[00:24:56] I'd love to know about any use cases that you've seen
[00:24:59] Have you have any any fun success stories to talk about agents who are using the product or teams that are using it
[00:25:06] A brokerages to help you know become more effective or efficient. Yeah, so I'll give you a couple
[00:25:12] So one is a one story that use case and I kind of mentioned this earlier, but my
[00:25:18] My client longtime friend Misty Solwich. She's out of I think the moan
[00:25:22] I hope I hope she is and I just said the wrong city that be hilarious
[00:25:27] But I'm now missy's a good friend and
[00:25:30] When she came and I started working with her a lot of what we worked on was just like she was generating leads from like home light and upnast and like
[00:25:39] referral exchange and ojo and obsidian and just like it was a disaster in her inbox and
[00:25:47] We started with just you know parsing those leads for her and working on that right and and getting them into her CRM and then
[00:25:55] And then we started working with her about like alright well, what do you what do you want to do with this when it comes in and she realized that like there is all this automation
[00:26:06] And like workflows that she can be putting into place now that she was getting the lead because it was such a chore just to get the lead
[00:26:12] Maley in there she never thought thought through what the next steps were gonna be right and
[00:26:17] I remember getting on a phone call with her a few times after we had spoke and she's like Scott now when I look at my business
[00:26:23] I look at it completely differently every time I look at anything that's happening
[00:26:27] I think about how can I automate it how can I integrate it doesn't fit into what my process is
[00:26:31] And I think it's just a really good example of like once you kind of go through this
[00:26:35] I know it sounds tedious sometimes to do some of this stuff
[00:26:38] But it really can benefit you as you go through it as an owner and you start thinking about the way to use these technologies
[00:26:46] differently and what it can do for the journey of your
[00:26:49] Of the customer as well, you know, and and you've gone through it setting up zaps and make and you understand that like
[00:26:56] It's very complicated, but it's probably given you really good perspective
[00:27:01] On what you can do to make things seamless in your business, you know, so that was one really great example
[00:27:07] Yeah, I love that. I mean I've tried to autumn. I've I don't know about you Scott
[00:27:12] I have to ask I've only found that routines and
[00:27:17] And having a process are the really the only things that work for me in life as far as like running my personal life my business life
[00:27:26] Yeah, this podcast I have to have repeatable and trustworthy systems because if I for example if I leave if I leave a lunch
[00:27:35] Even up for like debate like if I don't bring a lunch to the office one day
[00:27:40] I am likely to make a poor decision
[00:27:42] So if I bring a lunch I'm more likely to eat that particular lunch and that just is what works for me
[00:27:48] So I want everybody who's listening to think about things like that in any efficiencies in your business model
[00:27:55] You know, are you?
[00:27:57] Maybe you're dropping the ball on staying in touch with people
[00:28:01] Maybe you're dropping the ball on follow ups. Maybe you're dropping the ball on not looking at your business stats
[00:28:07] Maybe you're just you know think about you're dropping the ball somewhere everybody drops the ball
[00:28:11] So think about places to which you're like I'm not really good at that or I wish I could do this
[00:28:17] I wish this system could do this with that system
[00:28:19] That's where Scott and his team can come in and it's really fun because you can really let your imagination run run away with you
[00:28:27] And realize that you can use these different systems together and I think that's the most exciting thing
[00:28:33] Totally and I'll give you an example
[00:28:35] That's the outside of the box one as we've been we've been consulting or working this um the Adam briley team and and Kobe sway and their um
[00:28:43] And they came to me and they're like hey like man, you know like
[00:28:48] our mortgage brokers need this lead data to
[00:28:52] And we can't seem to find like a good mortgage broker solution to integrate with
[00:28:57] Like if we just get them a second Sierra account. Can you guys like connect the two Sierra accounts?
[00:29:03] And I was like
[00:29:04] Yeah, probably
[00:29:06] So we looked into it and we integrated two Sierra interactive sites one for his
[00:29:11] The mortgage brokerage which was under there on brela that I think they owned that brokerage right and then one for the real state team
[00:29:18] So then we can trigger all the data from one to the other and then back
[00:29:22] So everyone's visible and what's happening with the lead and there's no like
[00:29:28] sending uh, you know
[00:29:29] Get pre-approved to a seller you know what I mean and like missing like so all of the data is visible for the agent
[00:29:37] That's assigned and the broker the the loan officer that's assigned right and so that was a really unique use case
[00:29:42] But they were already have been working with us. They're already always thinking outside the box like how can we just make things easier
[00:29:49] Because the big pain right now getting the leads over to our mortgage team and there's lots of miscommunication right
[00:29:56] And if you know for anyone listening that thinks well this sounds like how much does this cost?
[00:30:01] It's actually ridiculously affordable
[00:30:04] So this is not an expensive solution. I want I want to make sure that everybody understands is like their lowest tier is like a dollar a day
[00:30:13] Like that's literally how inexpensive this is because what it's really doing it's connecting apps together
[00:30:18] They're in charge of that. They're gonna control and and make sure the data is is syncing
[00:30:23] And you guys get to think about what else can I do with this information like what can I do to make my business more automated
[00:30:31] If you have repeatable systems and you know that and and measurable and
[00:30:37] Reliable systems they have to talk to one another they just do otherwise. It's too much human effort and too much human error
[00:30:45] So what you're really trying to do is eliminate the opportunity for human error and we are imperfect
[00:30:52] And it's important that we remember that especially in our real estate business
[00:30:55] There things were good at and there things were not good at this is an opportunity to fill in the holes a little bit of
[00:31:01] Maybe if something you're not strong and by connecting apps together
[00:31:04] And I know we're sort of talking about it from a high level perspective, but
[00:31:08] There are so many ways you can use these tools to really make sure that your leads don't fall through that you don't miss miss out on lead opportunities
[00:31:18] And and then again with this new sort of actionable insights that are coming in shortly
[00:31:23] That's gonna be really exciting because you're gonna have actually things that you're gonna encourage people to do or maybe even do for us
[00:31:31] But yeah, what where are other ways in which people can use real sync to just make us minor change in their business that would help them
[00:31:39] So I would say
[00:31:41] One of the ones that we have a lot of people that still are signing up constantly that hear about it is just Google contacts
[00:31:46] And really it's your phone
[00:31:49] so
[00:31:51] You add someone into your phone
[00:31:54] Instead of being like ah now I gotta go put it in here and here and here and here yep
[00:31:59] We can automate it from your
[00:32:01] iPhone or your droid phone
[00:32:03] right into
[00:32:05] For the CRM's that are on our net on our platform right now obviously that's gonna end as we release the new app
[00:32:11] um
[00:32:12] But Sierra fall boss boomtown real geeks and basically as long as you have an email or you put a fake one in there
[00:32:18] If you have their name and phone number
[00:32:19] It will automate a new lead into your CRM and then you can decide what you want to do with that lead because the lead source is gonna come in as Google
[00:32:27] Or Google contacts
[00:32:29] Then you can have automation workflows set up for that person right so I think that's a very like simple one
[00:32:36] But it's like it is it's like how it's it's such a perfect example
[00:32:40] Because it's exactly what every one of us struggles with when we get a new contact and we're meeting somebody in person
[00:32:46] Maybe we're at a cocktail party or we're doing a social event
[00:32:50] We're not like in our business and somebody goes hey, uh, I'm thinking about buying or selling
[00:32:55] You know in the next year so stay in touch and you're like okay, let me get your information you get excited
[00:32:59] You're gonna want to put them in a as a contact in your phone and then you got to go
[00:33:03] Okay, now I got to remember when I get home to take it out of my phone drop it into real geeks or whatever CRM
[00:33:08] I'm using as well and all now I need to make sure I send them a welcome email and all of that
[00:33:13] This this could all be done for you once you put it in the phone it can start that workflow
[00:33:19] Imagine if you're standing in front you put it into your phone
[00:33:23] And then bone dings within five seconds with a welcome to you
[00:33:28] Love it right. I mean it and it goes back to like what are what are consumers used to
[00:33:34] DJ right like we're used to going on the Amazon
[00:33:38] Yeah, like just clicking and being like oh, I just bought this thing is coming tomorrow
[00:33:43] I don't have to do anything else. You know simple. That is you don't complicated it probably isn't back end
[00:33:47] Incredible right but the user experience is so simple. That's what people expect now, you know
[00:33:53] Because that's what's happening on the consumer side when it comes to like retail and buying stuff right yeah
[00:33:59] Yeah, I love that too because I love the instant part of that because not only is it great because we're used to
[00:34:06] In we're live in an instant sort of world now
[00:34:08] But also it's a great way to validate that that the information is accurate and that they're seeing it
[00:34:13] Like if you have it automate automatically sending a welcome email for example a text obviously they're going to get an alert
[00:34:19] But you could say hey do me a favor um you're gonna get an email from me
[00:34:23] I just want to make sure it doesn't hit your spam folder if it does let's pull it out you could literally do that within seconds
[00:34:28] A standing in front of the person and this is a great way to to do this and again all you've done is grabbed your phone
[00:34:36] Gone your contacts it with her android or or or or iPhone and you've literally entered them in and put them their information
[00:34:43] Again, you have to set this up, but setting it up is is really the that's what real sync is gonna do for you
[00:34:47] Yeah, so we this one's an out of a box integration too. You can literally do it
[00:34:52] Click click click it's pretty straightforward
[00:34:54] But we also can help you set it up
[00:34:56] But yeah, I mean if you're using an iPad or a tablet or any of that stuff right also like if you decided that you're using a form
[00:35:04] Where you want to get more data and not just put the contact in like if you're at open house like you mentioned earlier
[00:35:10] You know, we can integrate any form like a woofoo form or google form or
[00:35:16] Cognito forms like all these different exactly forms that are custom
[00:35:19] Get all that data into the CRM and still kick off that welcome me in the same way right?
[00:35:24] Yeah, so right now when I do
[00:35:27] I'll do like webinars and things and I get this list this this CSV file of here's all the people that attended
[00:35:33] Right, then I have to drop it into something else because I want to send them a text
[00:35:36] Thank you and then I have to drop it in another system is that I'm an email. Thank you
[00:35:39] And I would love to just have something go here
[00:35:43] I see all the people in your google sheet and I'm gonna go ahead and and run this automation on my own
[00:35:48] It's gonna just happen automatically that would save me
[00:35:51] They've saved me a lot of time actually so I'm
[00:35:53] Well right now not through our platform, but we could set up 43 zappier. We just did something ourselves
[00:35:58] where
[00:35:59] Any leave we get now whether it's website or anywhere else comes into our hub spot
[00:36:04] And then that triggers our simple texting solution that we integrated
[00:36:08] Yep, and then that sends the text automatically and then we send our contact record with our logo to save
[00:36:13] Just like you would do when you're like buying something online, right?
[00:36:17] We have all that set up and it's it's it's possible to do you just got nowhere to look for it right?
[00:36:23] Well, and again, you just have to really dream and and bring your dream to real sync and say
[00:36:29] Could we do this and if they can't do it? They might be able to build it or if they can't do it
[00:36:35] They're nice enough to say we know where you can go to get this done guys absolutely
[00:36:39] I even if you've never used
[00:36:42] Products like this services like this you really need to there is so much value here and this will help automate
[00:36:50] You want things talking to one another right and everybody so here's what I want everybody listening to do if you own your own brokerage
[00:36:57] Reach out to real sync see if they can integrate your tools if you don't own your own brokerage most of our listeners don't
[00:37:03] Talk to your managing broker and say hey, we have all these different systems
[00:37:07] I heard about this tool that integrates these systems and they talk to one another and we can do some cool stuff with it
[00:37:12] And it's not that expensive
[00:37:14] Which is going to be news to the or it's going to be great for the person to hear because it's not an expensive solution
[00:37:20] It's a very powerful and inexpensive solution and have them reach out to real sync
[00:37:26] And see if again, it's going to help the brokerage because it's going to make the brokerage be more appealing to other agents
[00:37:33] And retention is going to improve as a result one of I'm a recruiter guys
[00:37:37] I will tell you one of the biggest reasons why people leave brokerages
[00:37:41] There's a couple reasons one is support while real sync doesn't really solve for that
[00:37:45] That's you know face-to-face or voice-to-voice thing
[00:37:48] But I have all these different systems and I don't love that I have all these different systems
[00:37:53] That is a huge reason why people leave and and this is a solution that can solve for that
[00:37:59] So you don't want people leaving the brokerage for that reason
[00:38:02] So this is a great way if you're a broker-joner or a team and you won't want people leaving your team
[00:38:07] You want to make it so easy for them to stay connected
[00:38:10] This is the way to do that

Scott welcome to the show DJ what what a intro. Thank you so much for having me I'm super excited to be here and you know just Educate and offer some value to your audience Yeah, I'm excited. Thank you. So yeah, thank you and really I'm super excited about this because I love Products that integrate with other products and this is what it is I'm almost not that I would have ever been able to start this company But I kicking myself for not having the idea and you and your team obviously have built this incredible platform and basically Let's just before we dive right in let's get a little bit into your background So I mentioned a little bit about your past But tell us about how you got started at real sync and what was what were you what are you trying to solve there? And where did you come from? Yeah, so You know What kind of start my past that when I got back working with you know business You know real estate businesses and consulting I became an executive at viral marketing. That's where I kind of spoke to thousands of different clients And then one of the one of my partners from that You know, we were talking and had this idea. It was like man. There's There's all these new technologies coming out. There's nothing to connect them and he had sent Almost a million dollars on building out sales force and realized he still didn't have all the applications and solutions that he needed for his real estate business Because it's not really possible to build this all in one solution And because there's always new technologies coming you need something that connects and so we had this idea of You know, we we start looking around and there's a company called mule soft Which I don't know if you know people outside of the real estate space have heard of but They I think they sold to sales force for like six billion dollars a couple years ago But basically there's these in other industries there's these middleware platforms that build API to API integrations But there was nothing in real estate you were you're pre-limited the zappier and at the time when we started this zappier didn't have a lot of Available integrations within the real estate sector in itself right it was in a lot of other industries now It's expanded and it's an amazing tool But that's kind of how we got started we started you know traveling around going to the different like the in-mins and Talking to different software companies like follow boss and boom time We literally helped boom time build their API because at the time in 2017 2018 a Lot of these technologies, you know had their solutions that the users using But there was no external API and the API is the way you connect one app to another right that's kind of where you You know where you fast in the bridge on both sides right to keep it non-technical And so we were helping some of these different companies like build out their APIs As we were building out our solution And then you know we specifically were like you know what we want to be a residential real estate agent team broker solution where we're Connecting to just apps that you'd be using to enable your business to automate and grow right Yeah, it's it's a really amazing idea because we do this in other areas of our life if you've ever used If this than that that's a common one where you can connect lots of different apps together Not mostly not real estate related stuff like social media and other other Other technologies, but that's always a fun one to play with But this idea that apps can communicate is really important because you said something that I think every one of our listeners Can agree with probably was nodding their heads is everybody every You know tech firm is like we've got the all-in-one solution Well, they probably don't right nobody is yet really built all-in-one solution So the odds are you probably have multiple different tech providers for your business, you know you have some something for email you have something for your CRM Maybe you have a different website provider Maybe you have a lead source generator Maybe you have a place your buying leads from and you need these Systems to really talk to one another otherwise you're logging in and out of all these different systems I know it our firm here we We have six different systems when an agent joins us that we connect them to Well nobody wants to log in and out of six systems But that's how it works right now and so we need a tool like this so that they can talk so tell us like what does real sync actually do? Yeah, so So we have a our actual SaaS platform is a proprietary integration platform that we built basically the handle data from multiple systems and then you know source and targets send it back and forth right based on certain triggers that happen There's certain ways that you work within that system One of the biggest things that we talk to agents about is like and you just mentioned that DJ is When you bring on new agent like there's six systems it's like Man just to get them to behave in the way that you want to get into the CRM and update it Let alone they have to go then log into five different systems and update the same data or make sure They're getting the data out of one or another it's It just doesn't happen right? It's just a it's a very complicated thing to to and you don't want your agents really doing that either I mean how much time they're wasting having to do that right? So that's where we fit in is you know, we go all right if You know if you generate a lead to an inbox Rather than having to copy and paste that data This is a very basic one that a lot of people struggle with still and I get out in a call all the time is like You know you can set up a mail parser for you So automates the lead data basically scrapes the data and puts it in the CRM and then we can set up automation the CRM to apply a tag A follow-up task It can we can assign it to a certain agent depending on what you want or it can be you know Into a pond or around rob and depending depending on how you have your CRM set up So just that one thing right there All of a sudden you're like oh my god, I can sleep at night knowing my leads are just flowing into my CRM Right, that's just one example And then you start all the different systems you're talking about you know your your email Maybe avoid our phone solution like you know call rail dial pad Transaction management sky slope dock you sign dot loop. Yeah, you know broker meant alone wolf like all these different solutions that You may be using maybe your broker requires you to use certain solutions That and and so now you're you have your own personalized tech stack that you're trying to marry with the brokers tech stack And it just becomes very overwhelming and complicated and there's a lot of inefficiencies and that's what we fit in our solutions meant To integrate all these different solutions now we don't integrate to every app I wish I could say we did right now But our road map is to as we've been building our new solution It's much more scalable for us to add applications quickly So that you can come the real thing can go oh my god, they have like all seven of the apps I'm using and I can Click click click click click and set up filters and yeah make it all work, you know it's it's You know, it's even so much cooler than than that to me because it and yes, that's a great explanation I want everybody to do this it not when you if you're driving don't do this right now But if you're not driving go to real sync.com and again Real s-y-n-c-h.com go to their integrations and just look at the sheer number of different Real estate tech services that they connect with I guarantee some of your products or services that every one of our listeners use are in here Even if it's just I use Google email. I use Google Calendar. It's in here every Everything I mean you say you don't do with everyone, but just about everyone and if you see a tool that isn't in here Reach out to Scott and his team and they can consider adding it to their platform But basically the way I like to think about these tools is you get let get to let your creativity kind of run wild because now that these These integrations are happening and these systems can talk to one another. I always like to say wouldn't it be cool if Right and so that's that's what this system does like wouldn't it be cool if every time somebody comes in for an open house That lead that I capture on my tablet or wherever goes automatically into my CRM it automatically maybe gets an email Maybe there's some text maybe the This these this is real sync can connect all the different apps to make this happen Yeah, absolutely and one of the things you mentioned too is if like this step back if you come to our platform You don't see an app sure we may be able to add it But also we have a services part of our business where we'll just Find a solution that already connects with it like Zapier is much more expansive now or make Yep gets complicated right, but We can go and just do it for you as well, which is something that I really Love that we offer that part of it part of the business because So many times it's like you have this idea and you're like man I wish I can just do this and that and like maybe we just haven't created that solution yet But we can still try to figure it out for you which is fantastic and You're right. It shifts the way you think about technology You start thinking about what processes do I have in my business That I can maybe add some automation or tech to Knowing that there's a company like ours out there to help you make the connection Right, so a lot of times just like this idea But now you can go you know what I can actually do it And so I always tell tell team owners Instead of just going and grabbing the shiny new technology Step back and think about like what's the life cycle from the time the lead is generated Until you're putting it on a nurture campaign after it closes And what do you want to happen Everything in between whether it's like internal type of system things or towards the consumer Or some of the vendors that you know all that different stuff you can think about and then Go all right. I need a tech tool for this one part of this process It probably exists already we can go find it and add it and connect it, you know Yeah, and I also love the fact that your team will also say hey, we don't have that But we can give you an idea about how to get this done on make.com or or Zapier or if this than that There's there are and by the way I subscribe to make.com and because it was the only one that could do this one thing That I needed it to do and boy I would love to have had your services at that time because It is complicated and I'm a pretty tech savvy person and I was struggling I am still struggling with make but it's it's cool But these guys what I love that you do is you have the ability to just take all these tools get them to talk to one another And then you as the agent get to figure out what do you want you get to design your customer experience And then leveraging the tools you already have you're just gonna have them talk to one another so there isn't duplication of effort You're not going into one system and then another system and another system everything's working in sync I but I know you guys are working on a new product too. Can you share anything about your your new Development I didn't know that's a wrap's around no no absolutely we can um and To reiterate what you just said to before I share yeah Yeah, like Maximizing the tools you have so many times it's like oh, I gotta go get this other tool right DJ and it's like Well, let's look at how we can make sure that everything's efficient automated maximize And integrated with what you have before you decide to go get a different tool because you're never really gonna know If this tool is perfect for your business or not if you're not using it right so I always recommend that as well You know um But yeah, man our our new solution. I'm so excited about so One of the one of the parents parent one of the big issues that we've had is the way our original platform was built It would take us a long time to add another app to the whole suite of apps right so Anywhere from like four to six weeks, which is just way too long It's just impossible to keep up because new technology is coming out like this right Um, so we went on this road map of you know what we need to rebuild our common model how we handle data So that we can add an application to our entire suite of apps within two to three days Wow, which is what we're doing what what we're doing now when we release the new app so very exciting So what it's gonna do is you know that integration page you see right now is gonna You know, that's gonna turn from that to you know 150 200 apps over the next year very quickly So that really we can say hey we connect to everything that a real estate a residential real estate company broker agent would need in their business right and then While we were doing that we we were looking and going you know what like We're aggregating all this data how do we help give actionable insights To our clients that are connecting to our platform. Yeah, so we built our own app real syncs app to where you can connect the follow-up boss or Sierra or a boomtown Hopefully a brividi Syncs when I'm gonna be one of our partners color Williams commands Give me one of our partner like we have all these different partners lined up just waiting for us to enable them And what it's gonna do Is it's gonna allow you to see what's happening in your business from an agent activity perspective a volume and sales perspective a lead source ROI perspective And just those all that comprehensively and then give you actual insight To identify like where the holes are what where do you need to make improvements? What's actually going on your business because I've talked to all these different CRM's and the one thing that they are willing to admit is the reporting is not great with a lot of these solutions So we're gonna bring it all in where you can connect Not just CRM but transaction management. You can connect the The lead gen solutions you can connect quick books online like all these different accounting solutions So all this data is aggregating and then we're breaking it down is showing you what is most important so you can make those decisions Yeah, I love that so you're not just facilitating the communication from one app to another which is amazing and automating a lot of Manual processes that we're doing now, but now you're saying hey, by the way since we're passing all this data back and forth Let's go ahead and figure out a way to give the end user the REALTOR some Some reasons some insight into this data that they can use to actually further their relationships they have with their clients or You know and and so I love this does AI play any role in some of the data analysis is AI going to give people like Some reason to say hey, we noticed this thing. We want you to reach out for this reason Yeah, so and initially no I feel like people just use the term AI when it's not really AI like there's a lot of You know if then type Data where we're looking at ratios and what they should be and and so you we're gonna get a lot inside like that Notifying the owner like hey, you're your conversion for this particular agent from the time they meet in appointment to sign Is much lower than the industry average and then eventually we'll have our own averages as we're aggregating data right Part of a roadmap though is to add in some AI solutions uh, I can't really get into that too much, but it's gonna help you facilitate Taking action, which is the biggest thing yep that people get stuck on is like hey all of a sudden I gave you like hey there's these 20 leads and haven't been touched that came in and haven't been touching the first 24 hours You should probably call them and then they agents like oh, I don't have time and then they can maybe hit a button And we we do the calling for them something like that right? It's kind of the the roadmap that we're going, but that would be I think you know we're talking There's a lot of phases so that'd be something early next year maybe but like that's kind of the idea where Where the actionable insights were giving you We can also Do it for you and that's the wow Yeah, well even just getting the actionable insights is incredible because if I'm an agent and I'm wearing every hat That I have to wear because I'm a business owner. I'm also You know the agent. I'm also my own marketing team. I'm my customer service team and um, you know Everything else that REALTORS do psychologists sometimes Um, they play a lot of different roles and it's tough and it's hard and it's not always easy to take a step back and analyze this data And by the way the same skill set that's good at interpersonal effectiveness like the person to person eyeball to eyeball stuff Is not the same skill set that's good at interpreting data right like those are two very different skills and usually different personality types So you might be really great at I'm the face-to-face person everyone I meet loves me and wants to hang out with me But I don't really have a good sense of what my close ratio is or what my appointment to list ratio is or you know How many people do I meet have to meet next year that I don't yet know to hit my my goals You have Tools that will actually be able to interpret this data and give you actionable insights of like hey, we noticed this And that I think is so super cool. Yeah, it's super it's super exciting DJ. We're so stoked about it You've been working on it for about a year and um, yeah, and you know also like with that that team owner you just mentioned You know like a lot of times it's very tough to put on a sales manager hat if you've hired some agents too And especially if you're in production still man. There's just it's just so many different jobs right and technology can really help If you add the right thing tools right and you understand where you need to pull the levers and I think a lot of times There just isn't that visibility and that's what we're trying to solve is that like you're adding these different solutions But you don't know how to maximize um, you don't know if it's really something you need you just adding it because Someone else told you to use it And you may not know if it's even helping your business. We really want to give you A really good visibility into your own business through the window where you can see everything happening And go oh, I should pull that lever, you know, yeah, that that lead source here is gonna give me more return This thing you know what I mean and things like that where it's like very You know, we're coming from a place where we've you know my business partner runs a huge real estate team and Um, you know a lot of insight from them, but a lot of insight from our great clients that we've worked with I'm like what they're looking for and we're trying to really bring that to the table. Yeah Yeah, it's funny. I was I'm kind of going through a process like this myself and I think our audience will Can relate to this so We I recruit REALTORS is my day job that that's what I do here at kale realty and yeah One of the things that's always been a challenge for us is there aren't a lot of good recruiting REALTOR solutions. They're just aren't um, there's a few but there's not very many players in the space and which is kind of surprising But anyway, I ended up going for our CRM for our recruiters not for our agents Just our people who recruit REALTORS we went with Zoho because they're very open and they have a big open Platform it's it's really very impressive and They and then I wanted to connect all of my other apps to Zoho and Zoho is is pretty pretty flexible with that I will tell you it is so and this is not a knock at Zoho. It's just how integration is so complicated It is so difficult for me to integrate all of my different apps with Zoho I cannot tell you this sheer amount of hours I have put into get my VoIP system with with texting in there my Calendly, which is how I schedule appointments in there. It's not that easy and I love that you guys make it easy Because I needed something like this sadly it was before I met you But I cannot tell you the and everybody can relate to this even guys even if you're just thinking How do I connect my my Google account to X to my to this other Product I have to real geeks or or whatever CRM Yes There's ways to do this real sync and even help you just sync up your calendar even so I'd love to know about any use cases that you've seen Have you have any any fun success stories to talk about agents who are using the product or teams that are using it A brokerages to help you know become more effective or efficient. Yeah, so I'll give you a couple So one is a one story that use case and I kind of mentioned this earlier, but my My client longtime friend Misty Solwich. She's out of I think the moan I hope I hope she is and I just said the wrong city that be hilarious But I'm now missy's a good friend and When she came and I started working with her a lot of what we worked on was just like she was generating leads from like home light and upnast and like referral exchange and ojo and obsidian and just like it was a disaster in her inbox and We started with just you know parsing those leads for her and working on that right and and getting them into her CRM and then And then we started working with her about like alright well, what do you what do you want to do with this when it comes in and she realized that like there is all this automation And like workflows that she can be putting into place now that she was getting the lead because it was such a chore just to get the lead Maley in there she never thought thought through what the next steps were gonna be right and I remember getting on a phone call with her a few times after we had spoke and she's like Scott now when I look at my business I look at it completely differently every time I look at anything that's happening I think about how can I automate it how can I integrate it doesn't fit into what my process is And I think it's just a really good example of like once you kind of go through this I know it sounds tedious sometimes to do some of this stuff But it really can benefit you as you go through it as an owner and you start thinking about the way to use these technologies differently and what it can do for the journey of your Of the customer as well, you know, and and you've gone through it setting up zaps and make and you understand that like It's very complicated, but it's probably given you really good perspective On what you can do to make things seamless in your business, you know, so that was one really great example Yeah, I love that. I mean I've tried to autumn. I've I don't know about you Scott I have to ask I've only found that routines and And having a process are the really the only things that work for me in life as far as like running my personal life my business life Yeah, this podcast I have to have repeatable and trustworthy systems because if I for example if I leave if I leave a lunch Even up for like debate like if I don't bring a lunch to the office one day I am likely to make a poor decision So if I bring a lunch I'm more likely to eat that particular lunch and that just is what works for me So I want everybody who's listening to think about things like that in any efficiencies in your business model You know, are you? Maybe you're dropping the ball on staying in touch with people Maybe you're dropping the ball on follow ups. Maybe you're dropping the ball on not looking at your business stats Maybe you're just you know think about you're dropping the ball somewhere everybody drops the ball So think about places to which you're like I'm not really good at that or I wish I could do this I wish this system could do this with that system That's where Scott and his team can come in and it's really fun because you can really let your imagination run run away with you And realize that you can use these different systems together and I think that's the most exciting thing Totally and I'll give you an example That's the outside of the box one as we've been we've been consulting or working this um the Adam briley team and and Kobe sway and their um And they came to me and they're like hey like man, you know like our mortgage brokers need this lead data to And we can't seem to find like a good mortgage broker solution to integrate with Like if we just get them a second Sierra account. Can you guys like connect the two Sierra accounts? And I was like Yeah, probably So we looked into it and we integrated two Sierra interactive sites one for his The mortgage brokerage which was under there on brela that I think they owned that brokerage right and then one for the real state team So then we can trigger all the data from one to the other and then back So everyone's visible and what's happening with the lead and there's no like sending uh, you know Get pre-approved to a seller you know what I mean and like missing like so all of the data is visible for the agent That's assigned and the broker the the loan officer that's assigned right and so that was a really unique use case But they were already have been working with us. They're already always thinking outside the box like how can we just make things easier Because the big pain right now getting the leads over to our mortgage team and there's lots of miscommunication right And if you know for anyone listening that thinks well this sounds like how much does this cost? It's actually ridiculously affordable So this is not an expensive solution. I want I want to make sure that everybody understands is like their lowest tier is like a dollar a day Like that's literally how inexpensive this is because what it's really doing it's connecting apps together They're in charge of that. They're gonna control and and make sure the data is is syncing And you guys get to think about what else can I do with this information like what can I do to make my business more automated If you have repeatable systems and you know that and and measurable and Reliable systems they have to talk to one another they just do otherwise. It's too much human effort and too much human error So what you're really trying to do is eliminate the opportunity for human error and we are imperfect And it's important that we remember that especially in our real estate business There things were good at and there things were not good at this is an opportunity to fill in the holes a little bit of Maybe if something you're not strong and by connecting apps together And I know we're sort of talking about it from a high level perspective, but There are so many ways you can use these tools to really make sure that your leads don't fall through that you don't miss miss out on lead opportunities And and then again with this new sort of actionable insights that are coming in shortly That's gonna be really exciting because you're gonna have actually things that you're gonna encourage people to do or maybe even do for us But yeah, what where are other ways in which people can use real sync to just make us minor change in their business that would help them So I would say One of the ones that we have a lot of people that still are signing up constantly that hear about it is just Google contacts And really it's your phone so You add someone into your phone Instead of being like ah now I gotta go put it in here and here and here and here yep We can automate it from your iPhone or your droid phone right into For the CRM's that are on our net on our platform right now obviously that's gonna end as we release the new app um But Sierra fall boss boomtown real geeks and basically as long as you have an email or you put a fake one in there If you have their name and phone number It will automate a new lead into your CRM and then you can decide what you want to do with that lead because the lead source is gonna come in as Google Or Google contacts Then you can have automation workflows set up for that person right so I think that's a very like simple one But it's like it is it's like how it's it's such a perfect example Because it's exactly what every one of us struggles with when we get a new contact and we're meeting somebody in person Maybe we're at a cocktail party or we're doing a social event We're not like in our business and somebody goes hey, uh, I'm thinking about buying or selling You know in the next year so stay in touch and you're like okay, let me get your information you get excited You're gonna want to put them in a as a contact in your phone and then you got to go Okay, now I got to remember when I get home to take it out of my phone drop it into real geeks or whatever CRM I'm using as well and all now I need to make sure I send them a welcome email and all of that This this could all be done for you once you put it in the phone it can start that workflow Imagine if you're standing in front you put it into your phone And then bone dings within five seconds with a welcome to you Love it right. I mean it and it goes back to like what are what are consumers used to DJ right like we're used to going on the Amazon Yeah, like just clicking and being like oh, I just bought this thing is coming tomorrow I don't have to do anything else. You know simple. That is you don't complicated it probably isn't back end Incredible right but the user experience is so simple. That's what people expect now, you know Because that's what's happening on the consumer side when it comes to like retail and buying stuff right yeah Yeah, I love that too because I love the instant part of that because not only is it great because we're used to In we're live in an instant sort of world now But also it's a great way to validate that that the information is accurate and that they're seeing it Like if you have it automate automatically sending a welcome email for example a text obviously they're going to get an alert But you could say hey do me a favor um you're gonna get an email from me I just want to make sure it doesn't hit your spam folder if it does let's pull it out you could literally do that within seconds A standing in front of the person and this is a great way to to do this and again all you've done is grabbed your phone Gone your contacts it with her android or or or or iPhone and you've literally entered them in and put them their information Again, you have to set this up, but setting it up is is really the that's what real sync is gonna do for you Yeah, so we this one's an out of a box integration too. You can literally do it Click click click it's pretty straightforward But we also can help you set it up But yeah, I mean if you're using an iPad or a tablet or any of that stuff right also like if you decided that you're using a form Where you want to get more data and not just put the contact in like if you're at open house like you mentioned earlier You know, we can integrate any form like a woofoo form or google form or Cognito forms like all these different exactly forms that are custom Get all that data into the CRM and still kick off that welcome me in the same way right? Yeah, so right now when I do I'll do like webinars and things and I get this list this this CSV file of here's all the people that attended Right, then I have to drop it into something else because I want to send them a text Thank you and then I have to drop it in another system is that I'm an email. Thank you And I would love to just have something go here I see all the people in your google sheet and I'm gonna go ahead and and run this automation on my own It's gonna just happen automatically that would save me They've saved me a lot of time actually so I'm Well right now not through our platform, but we could set up 43 zappier. We just did something ourselves where Any leave we get now whether it's website or anywhere else comes into our hub spot And then that triggers our simple texting solution that we integrated Yep, and then that sends the text automatically and then we send our contact record with our logo to save Just like you would do when you're like buying something online, right? We have all that set up and it's it's it's possible to do you just got nowhere to look for it right? Well, and again, you just have to really dream and and bring your dream to real sync and say Could we do this and if they can't do it? They might be able to build it or if they can't do it They're nice enough to say we know where you can go to get this done guys absolutely I even if you've never used Products like this services like this you really need to there is so much value here and this will help automate You want things talking to one another right and everybody so here's what I want everybody listening to do if you own your own brokerage Reach out to real sync see if they can integrate your tools if you don't own your own brokerage most of our listeners don't Talk to your managing broker and say hey, we have all these different systems I heard about this tool that integrates these systems and they talk to one another and we can do some cool stuff with it And it's not that expensive Which is going to be news to the or it's going to be great for the person to hear because it's not an expensive solution It's a very powerful and inexpensive solution and have them reach out to real sync And see if again, it's going to help the brokerage because it's going to make the brokerage be more appealing to other agents And retention is going to improve as a result one of I'm a recruiter guys I will tell you one of the biggest reasons why people leave brokerages There's a couple reasons one is support while real sync doesn't really solve for that That's you know face-to-face or voice-to-voice thing But I have
