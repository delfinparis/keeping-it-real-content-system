[00:01:34] how do you know who to contact? Well, what if I were to tell you there's a recruiting and
[00:01:38] retention tool powered by artificial intelligence that shows you exactly which agents in your local
[00:01:44] market are looking to leave their brokerage right now and which agents at your own firm are also
[00:01:50] looking to leave you? Now, I've been recruiting REALTORS for 15 years and I've hired over 2000

[00:02:11] but Cordid's AI went and visited my recruiting website and read everything I offer. So now when
[00:02:16] I'm recruiting, Cordid's AI tells me exactly what to say based on that agent's needs and what
[00:02:22] my brokerage can offer. It even writes emails for me. I've never seen anything like it and I use it

[00:05:55] So this is a really exciting session. We did this last month and it was a huge hit. And so I want
[00:06:02] everybody to look into the chat right now. I put a link to something called the agent wheel.
[00:06:08] Put that on your desktop. If you can. And we're going to actually we're going to be following along.
[00:06:14] And Coach Brent is going to show to talk about how to do this. But let's introduce our next
[00:06:19] our next presenter. We have coach Brent Scott from the locker room. By the way, the locker room
[00:06:25] website, TLR Nation dot com. You can learn more about their coaching programs and learn more
[00:06:32] about what what Brent and his team does. And we will have a link to that here in the chat.
[00:06:36] And I'm sure we'll be sending that out to you after the presentation as well. But let me tell you
[00:06:41] more about Brent Scott. Now coach Brent Scott made a bold career shift in 2003, leaving behind a
[00:06:48] senior retail management position to venture into the world of real estate. Like many aspiring
[00:06:53] agents, he faced initial challenges and exited the industry within a few years within two years.
[00:07:00] Now undeterred Brent relocated to Florida in 2005 and made a triumphant for return to real estate
[00:07:08] obtaining his broker's license despite navigating the turbulent market crash. We we're all
[00:07:13] enough. We remember of 2007 to 2008. He persevered and took a leap of faith by establishing his own
[00:07:20] brokerage in 2009, although the venture encountered setbacks ultimately failed in 2010. Brent
[00:07:25] refused to be discouraged. He regrouped, honed his leadership abilities and embraced a mindset of
[00:07:30] learning from failure. Boy, we can all relate to that. 2017, Brent dedicated himself to coaching
[00:07:38] real estate agents full time, launching a highly acclaimed coaching program in Northwest Florida,
[00:07:43] notably 80% of his clients were fresh faces in the industry. And under his guidance,
[00:07:48] they collectively earned over 1 million in gross commission income in 2019. Now presently, Brent holds
[00:07:55] the esteem position of national coach and trainer at the locker room real estate coaching company.
[00:08:01] He shares his expertise through engaging continuing education workshops and provides personalized
[00:08:06] coaching to offices and agents nationwide. Additionally, Brent collaborates with approximately a
[00:08:12] dozen real estate brokers, owners and team leaders leveraging his insights to help them amplify
[00:08:17] the growth of their organization. Brent is also a fractional CEO of a prominent real estate brokerage
[00:08:23] here in Chicago to learn more about Brent's offering TLR Nation.com. We also are going to have
[00:08:30] an invitation for you to schedule some time with Brent. Schedule with Brent.com is that website.
[00:08:36] We'll have that in there and Brent will tell you about sort of how to do that going forward.
[00:08:41] And before we bring Brent on, I'll also talk about who Brent is going to be speaking to today.
[00:08:46] So this is really exciting for me. I, as my first opportunity, sort of getting to see this woman
[00:08:53] who is incredible here in Chicago. She's made a huge splash relatively new to the industry and really
[00:08:59] is just absolutely crushing it. Her name is Melanie Miller. She is with Keller Williams,
[00:09:04] one Chicago here in the city. So let me tell you more about Melanie. Now Melanie Miller, who is
[00:09:10] known as Mel Mill. She's a top producing Chicago land REALTOR specializing in multi-family
[00:09:15] investment properties. She purchased her first multi-unit at 23 and now owns and manages 10 real
[00:09:21] estate doors. A former division one volleyball player, she brings the same drive and dedication to
[00:09:26] real estate earning top industry accolades, including the National Association of REALTORS 30 under 30.
[00:09:33] She's a co-founder of the EUME Group with unique a guild. Melanie helps build wealth through real
[00:09:40] estate. She also takes a stylish approach to marketing, blending her passion for fashion and
[00:09:45] beauty into her brand. While not working, she enjoys family time traveling and attending sports
[00:09:51] events. I want everybody to follow Melanie at Melanie. I'm so sorry. It's, oh, I'm sorry, it's
[00:09:58] Mel Mill underscore the real, the real REALTOR. I'll put that in that chat. We're going to follow her
[00:10:04] there. You don't have to type it out. I'll put it right there for you. And welcome both Brent
[00:10:09] and Melanie. Welcome. Let me just make sure you guys are unmuted. Thanks, DJ. Good to be here.
[00:10:16] Glad to see you. Hey, all right. I will let you two take it from here before we get started.
[00:10:21] Guys, go into the chat. Download the agent wheel. That is a process that coach Brent is going to be
[00:10:27] walking Melanie through. By the way, Melanie, no stranger to being coached as a as a former
[00:10:32] athlete. So she is, she's going to have a great time through this. I will let you two take it
[00:10:37] and enjoy. Well, thank you, DJ. And Mel, it's great to meet you.
[00:10:42] I'd write how are you? I'm fantastic. Tell me what would you like to get out of this conversation
[00:10:47] today? I would say when it comes to my approach to real estate coaching, I actually love when people
[00:10:56] point out holes in my business and show me how to fill those holes. Right. So I would say,
[00:11:04] I want you to pick me apart a little bit. Pick you apart. Okay. And why is that? Why do you find value in
[00:11:10] that? I find that. Mel, you just went on mute. Okay. The hopes to meet me. I don't know. Okay. No,
[00:11:21] I was going to say I feel like when we always kind of know when we're doing the right things because
[00:11:26] if we're doing it right, then we're going to see the results. But you may not even realize that
[00:11:31] what you think you're doing right may be wrong. And it can stop you from jumping to that next level.
[00:11:37] Right. So I always think about volleyball, my volleyball career. I was, you know, great athlete.
[00:11:42] I could hit the ball hard, but no one was picking apart. Like, hey, your arm swing really should
[00:11:47] improve this way because I was still hitting the ball hard. Does that make sense? So that's kind of
[00:11:51] how I approach, you know, real estate and what I would like to see in a coach perspective. Awesome.
[00:11:57] Awesome. Well, I think that I'm going to bring you a little bit of value today or at least I hope
[00:12:02] to that's my intent. And for everybody else, this is an exercise that if you've downloaded the
[00:12:08] worksheet through the chat, you can follow along with yourself. The intent of this exercise or
[00:12:13] this conversation is really to help identify just that. It's helped identify gaps. And the most
[00:12:20] important reason that we want to identify gaps is because number one, we all have them. Right. Mel,
[00:12:25] do you have a couple of gaps in your business that you know? Oh, absolutely. Do you probably have
[00:12:31] a couple that you don't even recognize yet? More than likely, I'd say. Yeah. And so it's number one,
[00:12:37] finding the gaps, but number two, and what I find is most important is prioritizing the gaps.
[00:12:44] Because there's so many things that we can work on in our real estate business all the time.
[00:12:49] That if you work on too much, you don't really move the needle a whole lot in any particular area.
[00:12:56] And vice versa, if you work on something really intentional and really intently for a short period
[00:13:02] of time, you can oftentimes have a pretty radical impact on your business. So that's why I like to
[00:13:08] have this conversation. Mel, I'm going to ask for a couple of things from you. I'm going to ask for
[00:13:15] a little bit of transparency. Sure. I'm going to ask for a little bit of vulnerability. My easy part.
[00:13:24] And above all, as my hat says, be you and be real, right? Just candid. It is. We've all got gaps.
[00:13:30] And so I appreciate you giving us the opportunity to dig a little bit into yours. Okay?
[00:13:36] So let's jump right in. Mel, have you, did you see the last session or have you seen the agent wheel
[00:13:42] before? I have not seen the agent wheel before. So this is new to me. So let me share with you,
[00:13:48] Mel the agent wheel. The agent wheel breaks down a real estate agents business into four main
[00:13:54] quadrants, productivity growth systems and profitability. And then within each one of those quadrants,
[00:14:02] there are three main components of your business that have the largest impact or influence.
[00:14:09] And so what I'm going to ask you to do is as we go through each 12 of these components of your
[00:14:14] business, I'm going to ask you to rate your business as it sits today on a scale from one to 10.
[00:14:22] Now one means needs major improvement. There are no zeros. And 10 means you have it mastered. There
[00:14:31] is no way to get better. Okay? And so I'm going to ask you to rate each one of these sections. We're
[00:14:39] going to maybe dig into a little bit deeper. Some of these different areas. And we're going to see if
[00:14:44] we can identify some gaps. Does that sound all right? Yeah. Perfect. Let's start in this productivity
[00:14:50] quadrant. And so that the first section of the productivity crop, we got you on the wrong screen
[00:14:55] that we got to see if you can switch to the agent wheel. Oh my apologies.
[00:15:04] We on the right screen now? Yes, sir. Perfect. Okay. So when we talk about lead generation,
[00:15:11] this probably makes a lot more sense now that you can see it. When we talk about lead generation,
[00:15:17] we talk about lead generation as an entire system. So we talk about how effective is it? How much does
[00:15:25] it res, you know, what are your results? What are your return on investment? How leveraged is it?
[00:15:32] How systemized is it? How consistent is it? Scale from one to 10. How would you rate your lead
[00:15:38] generation as a system? I would say about a seven. Tell me what a seven looks like in lead generation.
[00:15:48] A seven looks like for me, I'm bringing in a lot of leads, but the system in which I filter
[00:15:55] through the leads and ensure that the leads are being followed up with could use a little bit of
[00:16:01] cleaning up. So you say filter and follow follow up. What do you mean by filter?
[00:16:08] So again, the way I go about garnering leads is they come very frequent, but when that happens,
[00:16:14] you have to do a more like honed in version to make sure, okay, is this just someone who wants to
[00:16:20] just hang out with me? Is this just someone who is probably never going to turn into a true client?
[00:16:27] Basically, again, like the filtering system to make sure that the lead I'm bringing in is actually
[00:16:32] someone that's going to either transact with me or refer me to someone that will transact with me.
[00:16:38] Excellent. Excellent. And how many lead generation levers do you have?
[00:16:43] I have pretty much one main source of lead gen. And what is that?
[00:16:48] Social media. Social media. Love it. Okay. Let's talk about time management.
[00:16:55] So time management is more than time management. It is priority management.
[00:17:00] And so when we think about time management, we think about do you use a calendar? Is everything on
[00:17:07] your calendar that you're responsible for? Do you time block? Do you have an ideal daily or weekly
[00:17:16] calendar? If I looked at your calendar today, would it reflect your priorities? And if I looked at
[00:17:25] your calendar for the last two weeks, what would it tell me your priorities were? So scale from
[00:17:32] one to ten, how would you rate your time management? Four. Four. Talk to me about a four in time management.
[00:17:40] So I managed to get everything done, but I am inherently a people pleaser. So it makes it a little
[00:17:47] bit harder for me to put up those hard boundaries when it comes to my time. I also am not a huge
[00:17:55] calendar user, which is funny because I used to be so scheduledized. And even as a child, I have a planer.
[00:18:02] But I'm transparent, right? It gives me a little bit of anxiety sometimes to look at a calendar
[00:18:08] and see the full, you know, like, oh my god, you know, it gives me anxiety. So I just don't put it on
[00:18:13] a calendar. Now this event, for example, made it to my calendar because I'm like, hey, this is my
[00:18:18] hard, like this is what I have to get done for today. But everything else, sometimes I allow to be a
[00:18:23] little bit more fluid and flexible. Okay. And what would need to happen in order to move that
[00:18:30] from a four to six? Our boundaries. Boundaries. Okay. Boundaries around what?
[00:18:42] What is a working time versus like, oh, I can, I can make it work. I can accommodate. And
[00:18:53] I'd like to see myself be more like, I'm available at this time and this time. Does this work for you?
[00:18:58] If not, let's figure out a time that will work, you know, for my schedule as well. Aha. So appointment slots.
[00:19:05] Correct. Okay. Okay. Awesome. Let's talk about referrals. So referrals are opportunities that are
[00:19:14] presented to you from other people from your sphere of influence, from your vendor partners,
[00:19:21] from other agents. When I talk about referrals, I don't just talk about, do you get them,
[00:19:26] or do you get a lot of them? I talk about the system behind referrals. How do you ask for them?
[00:19:31] How do you present referrals? How do you promote referrals? How do you follow up on referrals?
[00:19:37] And how do you thank people for the referrals that they get? Scale from one to 10. How would you
[00:19:43] rate your referrals as a system? I'd like to say I'm probably at about nine on that one.
[00:19:50] Nine. Tell me about a nine in referrals. So majority of my clients, if not a hundred percent
[00:19:57] of my clients have referred me to someone else to transact with, but I don't just take it again
[00:20:04] from the perspective of like clients, buyers, and sellers. I have a very strong referral network
[00:20:09] from my lenders, from my attorney partners. People really trust in what I do and they refer
[00:20:18] their business, they refer me. Now, when I get the referral, it's also about like, oh my gosh,
[00:20:24] how did you come across me? I like to give also like client giveaways sometimes, ask them for
[00:20:31] the referral. I'm heavy on like no one's going to give you something if you don't ask for it.
[00:20:34] So I will strategically ask my clients for a referral. If they know, hey, if you know anyone else
[00:20:40] that's looking to get a multi unit and become a landlord like you, I would love to have a
[00:20:43] conversation with them. When it comes to again, my lenders, my lenders refer me heavily because
[00:20:50] I'm giving them a lot of quite a few referrals, but also they know that the service level that I'm
[00:20:55] going to provide to that referral is something that's going to reflect well on them as well.
[00:21:00] So I always follow up with all referrals. I'm sure to thank my clients when they give me a referral
[00:21:07] and so I would say that my system around referrals is pretty strong.
[00:21:11] Why did you decide to create such a strong referral system?
[00:21:18] I saw the value, right? Yeah, I mean, that's the best way. I would say that was, that has been my
[00:21:28] most profitable way into the business was the referrals. Yeah, yeah, you don't have to sell
[00:21:38] yourself when somebody else is sold you and referred you to an opportunity. That's awesome.
[00:21:44] I like it. Okay, so that gives us a productivity quadrant score of 21. Let's move into growth.
[00:21:51] So as a function of growth, database is one of the most important components of the business.
[00:21:59] So when we talk about database, I don't just talk about do you have one? I don't just talk about
[00:22:04] is it in a CRM? We're talking about how do you interact with your database? What's the health of
[00:22:10] your database? Do you know the addresses of all the people in your database? Do you engage with your
[00:22:17] database on a regular basis scale from one to 10? How would you rate your database?
[00:22:22] I would rate an eight. Eight. And what does an eight look like?
[00:22:27] So for me, you mentioned something great, which was a daily follow up. Sometimes people look at
[00:22:33] social media as a lead gen, which it is, but truly my social media is me interacting with my database
[00:22:41] on a daily basis. I can go to their Facebook, oh my god, you just had a birthday. Even without
[00:22:47] having to remember it, I can see it. Facebook is going to tell me, I just got a new dog. I'm
[00:22:54] having an event at a dog park. Come on out, bring your dog. I'm going to be able to see, oh,
[00:23:00] you like dogs from your social media, right? From your Facebook. So again, that's giving me
[00:23:04] a daily touch point with my database with my social media. I also like to do, like I said,
[00:23:10] client giveaways. You'll see me on social media like, hey, I want to give someone a hundred dollars
[00:23:17] to go to a restaurant that they love. I'll do those sporadically throughout the year. I do handwritten
[00:23:23] notes to my clients and send out like little Starbucks gift cards. I also make sure I'm tracking my
[00:23:29] database frequently, right? So I go at least probably once a week and go through all the people that
[00:23:35] I've come in contact with and kind of just follow up and say, hey, haven't heard from you in a while.
[00:23:40] I just want to see what's going on. I am actively working my database on a pretty much daily,
[00:23:45] if not weekly, like schedule. Awesome. Awesome. Awesome. Let's move into vendor partners. So you mentioned
[00:23:55] lenders and you mentioned getting referrals from some of your vendor partners previously. When we
[00:24:00] talk about vendor partners, I'm not just talking about your list of preferred vendors or those three
[00:24:06] names that you give out every time somebody asks you for a reference. I'm talking about the vendors
[00:24:11] that are truly partnered with you. I'm talking about they have expectations of you. You have
[00:24:17] expectations of them. I'm talking about the collaboration, the providing resources, whether it be time,
[00:24:26] money or otherwise, the system of showing them appreciation, the system of replacing them when
[00:24:33] they need to be replaced, scale from one to 10. How would you rate your vendor partners? Definitely a
[00:24:39] nine on that one. Nine on the vendor partners. Tell me about your vendor partner system.
[00:24:46] I run a tight ship and they run a tight. So actually this year, Yumi Group has launched something
[00:24:55] unique, I would say, as it pertains to getting in front of our database on a monthly basis.
[00:25:02] So within that, we've asked our vendor partners that we've been giving our business to for the
[00:25:06] last five or six years to have a more active approach to how they continue to help us grow the
[00:25:13] database and work the database, right? So at the beginning of the year, we let our vendor partners
[00:25:19] know what our goals were and how we want to see them be a part of those goals. It's more than just,
[00:25:25] oh, can you sponsor? Can you give us $500 so we can do this? No, we want our vendor partners to be
[00:25:30] present. We want our vendor partners to be relatable. We want our vendor partners to be active at
[00:25:37] the events. And then as a result, we always are rewarding our vendor partners with either again,
[00:25:44] those solid referrals. We like to take our vendor partners out like, hey, we're doing a big event.
[00:25:49] We do a big event at the end of the year, the celebration event. We like to have our vendor partners
[00:25:53] there. So we have a very strong relationship with the vendor partners that we ask to partner with
[00:26:02] us, but we're also very strategic on not everybody can be our vendor partner. Some people will say,
[00:26:08] oh, yeah, I'll give you money. I'll give you money. But it's like, no, it's more than that. Who do you
[00:26:12] actually want to work with? Because you have to close deals with these people. So we're very
[00:26:17] particular about who we allow on to be our vendor partners. Some people are going to, you know,
[00:26:23] say, hey, I want to assist you, but eventually some of them may fall off. And that's just the truth.
[00:26:27] We want to be aligned with people that have a similar goal and a similar vision to the human group.
[00:26:33] And so that's what we're always looking for in our vendor partners. Yeah, it is more than how much
[00:26:39] money can you give or how many open houses can you sponsor? It is who are you? What is your belief?
[00:26:45] What are your vision? What are your what's your value system? What's your culture? And is that
[00:26:50] an alignment with you as an as an organization? Excellent. Let's move to personal growth. So personal
[00:26:57] growth is just that it is working on the six inches between your ears. Or it is also physical.
[00:27:04] Some people look at physical growth as part of the personal growth journey. Either way,
[00:27:09] it requires commitment. It requires a system. It requires focus. It requires effort. It requires you
[00:27:16] putting the time into reading or meeting with mentors or coaches or going to the gym or the things
[00:27:24] that really focus on growing you. Scale from one to 10. How would you rate personal growth as a part
[00:27:31] of your business? I'd say I'm at a seven. Okay. What makes that a seven? I have a very
[00:27:40] scheduled routine when it comes to my workout. So I have had a personal trainer for the last
[00:27:44] two and a half years and even prior to me using him, I had someone else as a personal trainer.
[00:27:50] As DJ mentioned, I'm a former division one athlete. So I'll be honest with you. If I never saw
[00:27:55] a sport again, I would be okay. Trust me. But I realized that it is a severe part of my
[00:28:03] my dedication and just like my mental health to stay on that regimen, to give me like a little outlet
[00:28:09] as well. So I'm very particular about my physical health. In terms of my reading, I am a student
[00:28:18] of the game. I like to learn a lot, but I really like to learn more so on the like one-to-one
[00:28:24] basis situation. Kind of what Danielle was mentioning in the last earlier part of the session,
[00:28:28] where I will volunteer my time and say, hey, I just want to learn from you. Like I want to see
[00:28:34] how you did that. And I'm willing to not have to be paid to do it. I am willing to just partner
[00:28:41] because I know that that mental growth is going to happen from me, emulating the people that I find
[00:28:46] inspirational. I am trying to get better though right now into kind of reading my daily devotionals
[00:28:54] when it comes to actually like my religious beliefs. I believe it keeps me kind of grounded and
[00:28:59] centered. So I do start my day every day with reading a daily devotional now. Excellent.
[00:29:10] What happens if you miss a miss a day of the daily devotional of the exercise of the meeting with
[00:29:18] the personal trainer? I mean, what happens if you skip a beat? Your mind just kind of,
[00:29:25] it's like you feel rush. You don't feel like the routine is going to help you like center yourself.
[00:29:31] So I would say again, like especially with the daily devotional reading it every morning,
[00:29:34] I read it at the same time every morning, like I'm locked into it and it kind of just sets the tone
[00:29:39] for the day. Okay. Does that have an impact on your time management or priority management?
[00:29:46] It's starting to. Okay. Interesting how those things intertwine, isn't it? Yeah. Let's move into
[00:29:53] the systems quadrant transaction management. So this is from the point that you put a property
[00:29:58] under contract until it goes to close. It's all of the things in between all the stuff that has to
[00:30:04] happen in order to make a transaction successful. And I'm not just talking about the mechanics of it.
[00:30:09] I'm more so talking about the experience. I'm talking about the systems. I'm talking about the
[00:30:15] consistency. I'm talking about the leverage. How little time do you actually have to spend in
[00:30:21] transaction management? Scale from one to 10. How would you rate your transaction management as a system?
[00:30:29] Well, that's a, that's a little bit of a way to, I would say maybe I was thinking in eight before
[00:30:34] you said how little time do I spend? So then I'm thinking, okay, am I at a six? Because if you
[00:30:39] ideally want to be spending less time in the transaction management or not, right? So I guess maybe
[00:30:46] we'll settle and I'll put a seven for that one too, because it's like right in the middle.
[00:30:51] I pride myself with my clients being able to kind of be accessible to them, right? So I don't have
[00:31:01] a transaction coordinator. I've never had anyone else step in and handle my transactions.
[00:31:07] I have a very routine approach to dealing with the front end of my client. So most of the time,
[00:31:14] the majority of the work does come in on the transaction management side of things. So I prefer
[00:31:20] a more hands on approach actually. I like to be able to touch base with my clients every two,
[00:31:26] three days and say, hey, this is where we are. We're one step away from the closing table. We're three
[00:31:31] steps away. So yeah, I'll set on a seven on that one. How would leveraging that out more
[00:31:39] impact your business? I think it's the control freak in me that just won't allow me to get to that
[00:31:46] point yet. Okay. Yeah. Alright. Client care. So when we talk about client care, we don't necessarily
[00:31:55] talk about during the transaction. This is more of the entire experience, right? From the moment
[00:32:01] that you meet them through identifying that they have a need for business through the transaction
[00:32:06] and then beyond the transaction. I like to equate that to if your business is a club,
[00:32:13] what does it feel like to be a member of your club? So on a scale from one to 10, how would you rate
[00:32:19] your client care? You mean you're a bit sitting over here. Okay. Like this is where we pride ourselves.
[00:32:28] I know when I got into the business, that was my immediate like I want to give people
[00:32:35] more than just a transaction. I was like if people know me from like when I first got in the
[00:32:41] industry, they know me as the girl who was on Facebook going live on Facebook. Like hey cousin,
[00:32:47] like that was literally me to my clients or my future clients or prospect clients because I want
[00:32:53] all of my clients to feel like they are family to me. I will treat you like the same way I would
[00:32:57] treat my mom. I would treat you the same way. You know, your your mom, I would treat your mom
[00:33:02] the way I would treat my mom, right? So my clients immediately have a different level of trust, I think
[00:33:09] that buying an investment property, I think can sometimes even be a little bit scarier than
[00:33:14] finding a buying a home because now you're responsible for not just your lifestyle but also the
[00:33:19] lifestyle of your tenants. And so I want to help my clients bring their guards down because there
[00:33:26] are like they're like on a 20,000 before they meet me. But when they meet me and they're like oh my
[00:33:32] gosh, you are really making this feel like I can do it. Then I know I've already won. I've already
[00:33:37] closed the deal. Okay. All right. And what is the biggest reward to having such a high focus on
[00:33:46] client care? Oh my gosh, it's so cyclical to all of this, right? So the referrals are going to come
[00:33:52] back around, you know, events just building a club, it's going to come back around. I'm going to
[00:33:59] continue to grow personally because I believe it or not love people, right? So the more people I get
[00:34:05] to interact with and hang out with, like that's my personal growth. I mean, it's just if I wasn't,
[00:34:12] I live in my purpose when I'm doing this, that's the truth. And so by giving my clients that high
[00:34:18] level of care and precision, like that makes me sleep good at night. I don't go to bed with anxiety,
[00:34:23] like did I do enough? As long as I know my clients were like felt value from their interaction with me,
[00:34:30] I'm like perfect. This is bringing joy to my life. Okay. Let's switch to follow up. So follow up is
[00:34:39] that sacred time in between identifying somebody to talk to and them deciding to do business with you,
[00:34:47] i.e. sign a listing agreement, a buyer brokerage agreement, etc. It's that middle time where there's
[00:34:53] opportunity one way or the other and follow up needs to be very systematized. It needs to be very
[00:35:01] consistent. It needs to be very leveraged because they say fortune is in the follow up.
[00:35:08] Gail from one to 10, how would you rate your follow up? Eight. Okay. What are the main strengths of
[00:35:16] your follow up system? I don't like to follow up with people and be like, oh remember you said like
[00:35:22] last March, you're next March you're going to be ready to buy a house. I don't follow up with
[00:35:26] my clients in that way. I like to follow up with my clients again on their personal life.
[00:35:33] Right. So I'll give a good example. I have a client right now. He originally he's been following me
[00:35:38] on social media for quite some time. I've been seeing him, you know, nine times I've attended people
[00:35:42] kind of my social media. They're kind of looking for like that thing, right, which is investing in
[00:35:46] a multi unit. So I noticed he'd been following me. I'll go and I'll like his post, right. I'm not
[00:35:54] going to be scared to make the first move because that's going to break the ice and then he's going to
[00:35:57] be like, okay, cool. Like she's she's not. She's friendly. So that's my first little follow up. As
[00:36:02] soon as we I see them initially tag going to me, I'm like, okay, let me see what's going. I go into
[00:36:07] their page and I kind of like to see their likes and their interest. What do we have in common?
[00:36:11] Right. So this particular client that I'm bringing up, he is a basketball coach for my former
[00:36:16] high school. And he, you know, has been following me. He's like, I know a few people that you've
[00:36:20] worked with. We went, I didn't even realize he went to my high school or worked in my high school
[00:36:24] initially when we kind of had some conversations. But now as he's working through like, okay,
[00:36:29] I had an initial conversation with you. I think I want to start getting pre-approved. I follow up
[00:36:35] with him on the basis of, oh my god, I just saw you guys kill it in that game over the weekend.
[00:36:39] Like amazing. I'm not saying, oh, are you ready yet? Are you ready to get a pre-approval yet?
[00:36:44] No, I'm following up on like, you know, I want to put my son in basketball like, what programs
[00:36:48] are you recommending? Or oh, I'm doing an event next month. We're going to be like looking
[00:36:54] out of sweet at the Bulls game. I would love it if you came through. You know, so like my follow-ups
[00:36:59] again are persistent, but not in the persistent way that you would traditionally think, where it's
[00:37:04] like, oh, are you ready to buy or sell yet? What resonates with me is that your follow-up is
[00:37:10] relationship-based, not transactional-based. Yeah. Okay. All right. Let's move into the
[00:37:17] profitability quadrant. So the first component of profitability is net worth. And when I talk about
[00:37:23] net worth, I am not saying, do you have all the money that you want to have? Okay. When I'm talking
[00:37:28] about within the net worth, there's number one, do you know what your net worth is? Number two,
[00:37:33] do you have an active strategy to grow your net worth? Number three, do how much of your income
[00:37:40] is passive versus active? Number four, how well do you track and who holds you accountable to
[00:37:47] growing your net worth? And then finally, do you feel that you are where you should be at this
[00:37:58] chapter in your life? Scale from one to 10, how would you rate your net worth?
[00:38:05] I would say I'm about at eight on networks. Okay. I do know what my net worth is because I constantly
[00:38:11] am kind of tracking it. You know, as you guys know, I'm more than just like a real estate agent,
[00:38:18] I'm also an investor, right? So when I start looking at my profitability, I also look into why,
[00:38:23] like my assets that I currently own and what I'm looking to continue to acquire.
[00:38:29] So I use my real estate business, obviously, as like my job, you know, this is my tool to continue
[00:38:36] to build assets and along the way, I'm helping other people do the same thing. So again, I do keep
[00:38:42] track of my net worth. I'm constantly working on growing my net worth. I know sometimes as a real
[00:38:49] estate agent, we can pull away from ourselves to put it so much into our clients, but I really like
[00:38:55] to say, like, laser focus on to continue to build my portfolio as well. In addition to investment
[00:39:01] properties, are there any other revenue streams or income generating streams that you have or are
[00:39:07] looking to grow? Well, I did try, you know, like crypto a little bit, but I'll be honest, I like to
[00:39:14] watch my money grow on the dirt. I really do. I feel like it's the most tangible, like I can see it
[00:39:21] growing, but I'm open, right? I tell everybody, like if there's another investment strategy that I'm
[00:39:27] missing, I would totally be down, but like my family, like, invests in real estate. So it's like, I'm
[00:39:33] used to seeing that money in the dirt. Okay. All right. Let's talk about your budget. So your budget is
[00:39:42] knowing how much it's going to cost for your organization to survive for the next three to six months.
[00:39:49] Your budget includes projections for growth or decline. Your budget should include projections for
[00:39:59] expenses, additional leverage, new systems as you continue to grow your organization.
[00:40:04] When I talk about budget as a system, I talk about not only do you have a budget, but how often do
[00:40:10] you review your budget who looks at your budget and holds you accountable to your budget? Scale from
[00:40:16] one to 10. How would you rate your budget? I would say seven. Seven. Okay. What would it take to get
[00:40:26] your budget rating from a seven to a nine? Probably more digging into it a little bit more. It's
[00:40:40] passive. It's not something that I'm looking at on a very prominent basis. I just know that I'm doing
[00:40:48] events or doing things that I'm not having to pay for. So those are things where I'm like, okay,
[00:40:54] I'm it's still a solid budget. I'm not coming out of pockets of foot expenses in the business,
[00:41:00] but I'm not watching it or maybe like a monthly basis or I know some agents that are super like
[00:41:05] honed into their budget. I spit this so I need to get this out of it. I'm not at that level yet,
[00:41:11] but I don't have to come out of my pocket for anything really related to my business right now.
[00:41:17] Okay. And then let's talk about the PNL. So if the budget's looking forward, the PNL is looking
[00:41:24] backwards. If the budget is telling you what you plan to spend, the PNL is telling you what you
[00:41:30] spend. And when we talk about PNL, I talk about not only do you have one, not only do you review it,
[00:41:36] but how systematized is your review, how leveraged is it, how much time do you have to put into
[00:41:42] allocating or classifying expenses or doing things of that nature, who holds you accountable to your
[00:41:50] PNL and compares your PNL to a budget on a month or a quarterly basis. Scale from one to ten,
[00:41:57] how would you rate the PNL component of your business? I'm going to go right back to the time
[00:42:02] management side of things and give it a four. Okay. And why a four? I've never written out a PNL.
[00:42:10] I've reviewed it a few times, you know, if you're Keller Williams, you know. So I've reviewed
[00:42:16] what a PNL looks like, but again, I think because I don't see like me losing any money doing
[00:42:23] the business. I don't feel as like tied to looking at a PNL statement because it's like, I know I
[00:42:31] have lost in money because I'm spent in money, you know. Okay. Okay. So as we look at the agent wheel
[00:42:41] overall, do you feel that this is an accurate representation of where your business stands today?
[00:42:53] Yeah, but it looks pretty good. What stands out to you?
[00:42:58] Well, the wheel itself is very intertwined with one another each positioning. So it's kind of like if
[00:43:06] you look at on this side, on this side, okay, they like balance each other like they're usually around
[00:43:11] about the same score, except for the client care in the time management. Thank goodness the time
[00:43:21] management hasn't started impacting the client care yet yet. But all these things are very,
[00:43:27] again, they're cyclical. So you're going to have kind of that reflective view of each place.
[00:43:34] When you're falling short, you're going to see yourself fall short in the other component that's
[00:43:38] kind of reflective of it. Yeah, yeah, absolutely. What stands out to you as far as the biggest
[00:43:47] opportunity right now, not opportunity for the next 12 months or five years, but today,
[00:43:52] if there was an opportunity that you felt would have the biggest impact in your business, where
[00:43:59] would that opportunity lie? I would say on the productivity. Okay, more specifically,
[00:44:06] which one of those three components? Time management. The time management. So why would time
[00:44:12] management, how would improving time management change your world? Oh, leaps and bounds. I think
[00:44:23] if I had better time management, I would be able to execute on the things that are the side of
[00:44:32] the business that I don't want to work on. For example, the profitability standpoint,
[00:44:38] like that's kind of like a time strung you, like it requires you to sit down at your desk and work
[00:44:44] on your business. I'm super used to still working in my business. So if I'm able to improve my time
[00:44:52] management to take a little bit of time from inside to looking outside, that would be ideally the
[00:44:59] goal to grow even more. So what I'm hearing is that time management, improve time management,
[00:45:05] would also give you the ability to focus more on the profitability quadrant. And so what would be
[00:45:12] the first step in improving your time management? Well, Brent, no, that's what I'm asking you for. No,
[00:45:26] I would say the first step for me is got, I think it's going to be boundaries. Okay. And what does
[00:45:36] boundaries look like? What are some boundaries that you need to reset?
[00:45:42] Some main boundaries that I would probably reset would just be, again, not agreeing to do
[00:45:51] everything on someone else's time and more so agreeing to do things on my time.
[00:45:58] Okay. And so what would the steps be in order to reset those boundaries?
[00:46:06] Hmm.
[00:46:10] Maybe have a better conversation when it comes to expectation.
[00:46:15] And conversation with who? My clients, my kids, my referral partners, you know, just my partner,
[00:46:26] my husband, right? I'm balancing a lot of different things and I have to manage everyone's
[00:46:34] expectation because when people have mismanaged expectations, that's the biggest result of like a
[00:46:40] negative feeling for people. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, that's the gap between expectations and
[00:46:48] reality is where resentment and pain when it lives, right? Mm-hmm. Okay. In addition to expectations,
[00:46:56] if there was one more thing that you could do to improve your time management, what would it be?
[00:47:04] Probably to get over my anxiety and actually write stuff down. Like, look at it, put it on paper
[00:47:11] and like follow a more strict regimen. Okay. All right. So if it's not on your calendar,
[00:47:19] it doesn't exist type of situation. Yeah. Okay. All right. Is there something, and is there anything
[00:47:27] that as it relates to our conversation today? And this may be a little bit of a leading question.
[00:47:33] I'll cheat. Is there anything that you could see would be something that would be valuable for you
[00:47:39] to go ahead and put on your calendar on a regular and consistent basis because you know that it's
[00:47:45] an area that you need to put more focus into? Um, well, like I say, probably with the P&L, I should
[00:47:53] probably be taking a look at it. I'm going to say once a year, right? Let me at least start with once.
[00:47:59] That definitely wouldn't need to go on there. Do you usually look at that around tax time?
[00:48:09] I leave it all up to the higher ups. Like, I don't deal with it at all. Okay. All right.
[00:48:18] I probably should start digging in a little bit. So now that it is tax time, would this be a good
[00:48:25] opportunity for you to have implemented review time frame for your P&L? Absolutely. Yeah. Okay. All right.
[00:48:36] All right. So I hear boundaries. I hear time blocking, putting specific things on the calendar.
[00:48:45] If there was a third thing that you could do in order to improve or move the needle on time
[00:48:52] management, what would it be? I really feel like although the big two things. Okay.
[00:49:07] May I make a recommendation? Please. I improve your prioritization. Are you familiar with the
[00:49:14] Eisenhower metrics or the four quadrants of prioritization? I'm not. Okay. So there's a concept
[00:49:21] called the Eisenhower metrics that talks about how urgent an activity is and how important it is
[00:49:30] that you do it. And when you think about activities that are very urgent and very important that you do
[00:49:38] it, then that falls into the first quadrant, the first D, which is due. If it's an activity that's
[00:49:45] urgent, but it's not important that you do it, that falls into the second quadrant, which is
[00:49:51] delegate. If it's a project or task that is important for you to do, but it's not urgent,
[00:50:00] then that falls into the third quadrant, which is delay. IE, put it on your calendar time,
[00:50:05] blocking hour down the road to work on it. And then finally, that fourth quadrant, if it's not
[00:50:10] important that you do it, and it's not urgent that you do it, delete. Get it off of your list.
[00:50:17] Put it in that someday. I'll do it sometime when I don't have anything better to do.
[00:50:22] But if you use that prioritization metrics in every moment that somebody comes to you and they say,
[00:50:31] I need you to do this. I need you to do that. Or you even go to yourself and say, you know what?
[00:50:36] Maybe I should do something. If you throw it through that Eisenhower metrics quadrant,
[00:50:41] then that will help you perfect your prioritization skills. And I find that time management is not
[00:50:48] a time management issue. We can't manage time. The 24 hours are going to come and go regardless of
[00:50:55] what you do about it. It is prioritization management. And when we can better effectively manage our
[00:51:02] priorities, then we can create those boundaries. We can prioritize the things that are most important
[00:51:09] and most urgent. And the rest of the stuff, yeah, we fit it into that white space as we can.
[00:51:17] So Melanie, anything else that I can do, have I brought you some value? Have I helped you identify
[00:51:23] a couple of gaps that might move your business forward? Yeah, I like this wheel. I haven't come
[00:51:29] across it before, even with my own personal coaching. So this is interesting. And it's good to
[00:51:36] analyze your business in this way. So I like that. And Melanie, or do you have a team? Are you
[00:51:42] moving towards having the team? So I do have a team, but it's just right now we're in Duol. It's
[00:51:47] myself and my co-founder, unique Gil. And so we start UME Group in 2022. And we have not brought on
[00:51:56] any additional support agents or TCs or anything like that. I would say it's something that we've
[00:52:04] discussed, but again, we're controlled for each. So I understand. Well, I tell you, I have a similar
[00:52:10] conversation or exercise that I lead brokers and owners and team leaders through, even aspiring
[00:52:18] team leaders, because sometimes looking at it from a team leader perspective can help you maybe
[00:52:23] identify what six, 12 months needs to look like in order to move towards that trajectory.
[00:52:29] If you would like, I would be happy to schedule a conversation as a follow up to this as a way of
[00:52:35] thanking you for the time today. I'd be happy to schedule a conversation and follow up and maybe
[00:52:40] walk you through that exercise. I love that. Absolutely. And to everybody else, if you have completed
[00:52:49] your agent wheel, if when we went through this conversation, you completed, you scored all your
[00:52:55] 12 areas of your business. And you would like to have a conversation about that. I'm going to ask
[00:53:01] that you go ahead and send me an email. It's Brent at TLRNation.com Brent B-R-E-N-T at TLRNation.com.
[00:53:09] If you send me an email with your agent wheel scores, then I will arrange for a one-on-one conversation
[00:53:16] with one of our locker room coaches to talk about your agent wheel and maybe identify some paths
[00:53:22] forward. So, Mel, I appreciate your time today. Is there anything else that I can do to bring value
[00:53:28] to you today? No, I think you did an amazing job. I would just say I didn't write down my
[00:53:35] my score. I'd love to have it. So if you guys maybe screenshot or something. I'm innocent.
[00:53:41] I'm a send you your wheel after we end our conversation. Perfect. Awesome. Thank you, Mel.
[00:53:46] I appreciate your time. DJ, thank you so much for the opportunity to lead this conversation.
[00:53:54] Thank you both Brent and Melanie. I hope everyone was following along. And if you did or even if you
[00:54:02] didn't, the agent wheel is here in the chat. We will also email that out to everybody after the
[00:54:08] presentation. And everyone Brent has just invited all of us to do this process. We all have areas
[00:54:14] of our business that we can improve. So send an email to Brent at TLRNation.com. There is put
[00:54:21] that in the chat and schedule time to get your own personal agent wheel. It's an amazing thing.
[00:54:28] I was following along and I'll tell a quick story too. I was just yesterday having a doing an
[00:54:34] interview with a this reminded me because of Melanie's athletic past. I was doing an interview with
[00:54:41] a professional former professional skier. And she was a freestyle skier. She was in the ex-games
[00:54:47] and she was very prominent. She had an injury that she had to end her career in her 20s. And now she's
[00:54:52] a top luxury agent in Denver. And I was asking her how she made the transition. And she said,
[00:54:59] the coaching is all she's ever known. She's been on skis since she was a little girl. She grew up
[00:55:04] in Breckenridge. So she's always had coaches. And that she said, I wouldn't have gotten to the ex-games
[00:55:09] without coaching. She said, I wouldn't get to where I'm at now in my business without a coach.
[00:55:14] In fact, she goes, I have two business coaches that I hire. So we know that coaching that every
[00:55:19] athlete, you know, Melanie has had coaches her whole life. And of course, everyone should have a
[00:55:24] coach as well. There's always things coaches can see that we can't. And having that other perspective
[00:55:30] of, you know, somebody that can help you where you're getting stuck is boy, it is so invaluable.
[00:55:36] You can't do it all yourself nor should you try. You need help. So I have a coach. And of
[00:55:43] course, Melanie has coaches. And we encourage all of you to have a coach as well. So shoot that
[00:55:48] email over to Brent at TLRNation.com. And we will, Brett will follow up with you and get you
[00:55:55] into one of his coaching sessions or somebody on his team. And also TLRNation.com is an amazing
[00:56:01] resource for brokerages. If there's anyone out there who doesn't have a great coaching system
[00:56:06] at their own brokerage, take a look to see what they offer. Talk to your managing broker.
[00:56:11] We've employed that here at KL Realty, the locker room. It is awesome. I can't even tell you how
[00:56:16] great it is. It has taken our training and coaching to a totally different level. I mean, we surveyed
[00:56:23] a bunch of programs before we landed on the locker room. And it just blew us away. So check them
[00:56:28] out. They're amazing TLRNation.com. Brent, once thanks again, Melanie. Thank you for your honesty,
[00:56:34] your vulnerability, and your dedication to this business. You are an inspiration. And I'm also
[00:56:41] a friend of unique. So I'm a friend of your partner. I love you. Unique. She is as lovely as you are.
[00:56:46] And what a great team what you guys are. I forgot you guys were team members. So I'm so glad that
[00:56:51] you mentioned that. All right, guys, we will take a short break. We will be back in 10 minutes.
[00:56:56] Thanks, Mel. Thanks coach, Brett. Thank you so much. Thanks guys.

But most agents aren't looking to move right now. So how do you know who to contact? Well, what if I were to tell you there's a recruiting and retention tool powered by artificial intelligence that shows you exactly which agents in your local market are looking to leave their brokerage right now and which agents at your own firm are also looking to leave you? Now, I've been recruiting REALTORS for 15 years and I've hired over 2000 agents. I can tell you with no exaggeration, this is the tool I've been waiting for. Cordid's AI looks for trends across dozens of variables for each agent in your market and shows you which agents they believe are likely to move. Not only does it do that, but Cordid's AI went and visited my recruiting website and read everything I offer. So now when I'm recruiting, Cordid's AI tells me exactly what to say based on that agent's needs and what my brokerage can offer. It even writes emails for me. I've never seen anything like it and I use it every single day. Now, if you are looking to grow your brokerage, Cordid.io is the best tool out there. Visit Cordid.io to schedule a demo again.

We will have again a recording of that that you can listen to. And we're also going to make it an episode. We're going to make all of these sessions episodes on the show. So you'll have an opportunity to listen to them there. But we will be sending out the videos in the next week. So if you missed any of that, you definitely want to go back and watch. We're ready for our next session. So this is a really exciting session. We did this last month and it was a huge hit. And so I want everybody to look into the chat right now. I put a link to something called the agent wheel. Put that on your desktop. If you can. And we're going to actually we're going to be following along. And Coach Brent is going to show to talk about how to do this. But let's introduce our next our next presenter. We have coach Brent Scott from the locker room. By the way, the locker room website, TLR Nation dot com. You can learn more about their coaching programs and learn more about what what Brent and his team does. And we will have a link to that here in the chat. And I'm sure we'll be sending that out to you after the presentation as well. But let me tell you more about Brent Scott. Now coach Brent Scott made a bold career shift in 2003, leaving behind a senior retail management position to venture into the world of real estate. Like many aspiring agents, he faced initial challenges and exited the industry within a few years within two years. Now undeterred Brent relocated to Florida in 2005 and made a triumphant for return to real estate obtaining his broker's license despite navigating the turbulent market crash. We we're all enough. We remember of 2007 to 2008. He persevered and took a leap of faith by establishing his own brokerage in 2009, although the venture encountered setbacks ultimately failed in 2010. Brent refused to be discouraged. He regrouped, honed his leadership abilities and embraced a mindset of learning from failure. Boy, we can all relate to that. 2017, Brent dedicated himself to coaching real estate agents full time, launching a highly acclaimed coaching program in Northwest Florida, notably 80% of his clients were fresh faces in the industry. And under his guidance, they collectively earned over 1 million in gross commission income in 2019. Now presently, Brent holds the esteem position of national coach and trainer at the locker room real estate coaching company. He shares his expertise through engaging continuing education workshops and provides personalized coaching to offices and agents nationwide. Additionally, Brent collaborates with approximately a dozen real estate brokers, owners and team leaders leveraging his insights to help them amplify the growth of their organization. Brent is also a fractional CEO of a prominent real estate brokerage here in Chicago to learn more about Brent's offering TLR Nation.com. We also are going to have an invitation for you to schedule some time with Brent. Schedule with Brent.com is that website. We'll have that in there and Brent will tell you about sort of how to do that going forward. And before we bring Brent on, I'll also talk about who Brent is going to be speaking to today. So this is really exciting for me. I, as my first opportunity, sort of getting to see this woman who is incredible here in Chicago. She's made a huge splash relatively new to the industry and really is just absolutely crushing it. Her name is Melanie Miller. She is with Keller Williams, one Chicago here in the city. So let me tell you more about Melanie. Now Melanie Miller, who is known as Mel Mill. She's a top producing Chicago land REALTOR specializing in multi-family investment properties. She purchased her first multi-unit at 23 and now owns and manages 10 real estate doors. A former division one volleyball player, she brings the same drive and dedication to real estate earning top industry accolades, including the National Association of REALTORS 30 under 30. She's a co-founder of the EUME Group with unique a guild. Melanie helps build wealth through real estate. She also takes a stylish approach to marketing, blending her passion for fashion and beauty into her brand. While not working, she enjoys family time traveling and attending sports events. I want everybody to follow Melanie at Melanie. I'm so sorry. It's, oh, I'm sorry, it's Mel Mill underscore the real, the real REALTOR. I'll put that in that chat. We're going to follow her there. You don't have to type it out. I'll put it right there for you. And welcome both Brent and Melanie. Welcome. Let me just make sure you guys are unmuted. Thanks, DJ. Good to be here. Glad to see you. Hey, all right. I will let you two take it from here before we get started. Guys, go into the chat. Download the agent wheel. That is a process that coach Brent is going to be walking Melanie through. By the way, Melanie, no stranger to being coached as a as a former athlete. So she is, she's going to have a great time through this. I will let you two take it and enjoy. Well, thank you, DJ. And Mel, it's great to meet you. I'd write how are you? I'm fantastic. Tell me what would you like to get out of this conversation today? I would say when it comes to my approach to real estate coaching, I actually love when people point out holes in my business and show me how to fill those holes. Right. So I would say, I want you to pick me apart a little bit. Pick you apart. Okay. And why is that? Why do you find value in that? I find that. Mel, you just went on mute. Okay. The hopes to meet me. I don't know. Okay. No, I was going to say I feel like when we always kind of know when we're doing the right things because if we're doing it right, then we're going to see the results. But you may not even realize that what you think you're doing right may be wrong. And it can stop you from jumping to that next level. Right. So I always think about volleyball, my volleyball career. I was, you know, great athlete. I could hit the ball hard, but no one was picking apart. Like, hey, your arm swing really should improve this way because I was still hitting the ball hard. Does that make sense? So that's kind of how I approach, you know, real estate and what I would like to see in a coach perspective. Awesome. Awesome. Well, I think that I'm going to bring you a little bit of value today or at least I hope to that's my intent. And for everybody else, this is an exercise that if you've downloaded the worksheet through the chat, you can follow along with yourself. The intent of this exercise or this conversation is really to help identify just that. It's helped identify gaps. And the most important reason that we want to identify gaps is because number one, we all have them. Right. Mel, do you have a couple of gaps in your business that you know? Oh, absolutely. Do you probably have a couple that you don't even recognize yet? More than likely, I'd say. Yeah. And so it's number one, finding the gaps, but number two, and what I find is most important is prioritizing the gaps. Because there's so many things that we can work on in our real estate business all the time. That if you work on too much, you don't really move the needle a whole lot in any particular area. And vice versa, if you work on something really intentional and really intently for a short period of time, you can oftentimes have a pretty radical impact on your business. So that's why I like to have this conversation. Mel, I'm going to ask for a couple of things from you. I'm going to ask for a little bit of transparency. Sure. I'm going to ask for a little bit of vulnerability. My easy part. And above all, as my hat says, be you and be real, right? Just candid. It is. We've all got gaps. And so I appreciate you giving us the opportunity to dig a little bit into yours. Okay? So let's jump right in. Mel, have you, did you see the last session or have you seen the agent wheel before? I have not seen the agent wheel before. So this is new to me. So let me share with you, Mel the agent wheel. The agent wheel breaks down a real estate agents business into four main quadrants, productivity growth systems and profitability. And then within each one of those quadrants, there are three main components of your business that have the largest impact or influence. And so what I'm going to ask you to do is as we go through each 12 of these components of your business, I'm going to ask you to rate your business as it sits today on a scale from one to 10. Now one means needs major improvement. There are no zeros. And 10 means you have it mastered. There is no way to get better. Okay? And so I'm going to ask you to rate each one of these sections. We're going to maybe dig into a little bit deeper. Some of these different areas. And we're going to see if we can identify some gaps. Does that sound all right? Yeah. Perfect. Let's start in this productivity quadrant. And so that the first section of the productivity crop, we got you on the wrong screen that we got to see if you can switch to the agent wheel. Oh my apologies. We on the right screen now? Yes, sir. Perfect. Okay. So when we talk about lead generation, this probably makes a lot more sense now that you can see it. When we talk about lead generation, we talk about lead generation as an entire system. So we talk about how effective is it? How much does it res, you know, what are your results? What are your return on investment? How leveraged is it? How systemized is it? How consistent is it? Scale from one to 10. How would you rate your lead generation as a system? I would say about a seven. Tell me what a seven looks like in lead generation. A seven looks like for me, I'm bringing in a lot of leads, but the system in which I filter through the leads and ensure that the leads are being followed up with could use a little bit of cleaning up. So you say filter and follow follow up. What do you mean by filter? So again, the way I go about garnering leads is they come very frequent, but when that happens, you have to do a more like honed in version to make sure, okay, is this just someone who wants to just hang out with me? Is this just someone who is probably never going to turn into a true client? Basically, again, like the filtering system to make sure that the lead I'm bringing in is actually someone that's going to either transact with me or refer me to someone that will transact with me. Excellent. Excellent. And how many lead generation levers do you have? I have pretty much one main source of lead gen. And what is that? Social media. Social media. Love it. Okay. Let's talk about time management. So time management is more than time management. It is priority management. And so when we think about time management, we think about do you use a calendar? Is everything on your calendar that you're responsible for? Do you time block? Do you have an ideal daily or weekly calendar? If I looked at your calendar today, would it reflect your priorities? And if I looked at your calendar for the last two weeks, what would it tell me your priorities were? So scale from one to ten, how would you rate your time management? Four. Four. Talk to me about a four in time management. So I managed to get everything done, but I am inherently a people pleaser. So it makes it a little bit harder for me to put up those hard boundaries when it comes to my time. I also am not a huge calendar user, which is funny because I used to be so scheduledized. And even as a child, I have a planer. But I'm transparent, right? It gives me a little bit of anxiety sometimes to look at a calendar and see the full, you know, like, oh my god, you know, it gives me anxiety. So I just don't put it on a calendar. Now this event, for example, made it to my calendar because I'm like, hey, this is my hard, like this is what I have to get done for today. But everything else, sometimes I allow to be a little bit more fluid and flexible. Okay. And what would need to happen in order to move that from a four to six? Our boundaries. Boundaries. Okay. Boundaries around what? What is a working time versus like, oh, I can, I can make it work. I can accommodate. And I'd like to see myself be more like, I'm available at this time and this time. Does this work for you? If not, let's figure out a time that will work, you know, for my schedule as well. Aha. So appointment slots. Correct. Okay. Okay. Awesome. Let's talk about referrals. So referrals are opportunities that are presented to you from other people from your sphere of influence, from your vendor partners, from other agents. When I talk about referrals, I don't just talk about, do you get them, or do you get a lot of them? I talk about the system behind referrals. How do you ask for them? How do you present referrals? How do you promote referrals? How do you follow up on referrals? And how do you thank people for the referrals that they get? Scale from one to 10. How would you rate your referrals as a system? I'd like to say I'm probably at about nine on that one. Nine. Tell me about a nine in referrals. So majority of my clients, if not a hundred percent of my clients have referred me to someone else to transact with, but I don't just take it again from the perspective of like clients, buyers, and sellers. I have a very strong referral network from my lenders, from my attorney partners. People really trust in what I do and they refer their business, they refer me. Now, when I get the referral, it's also about like, oh my gosh, how did you come across me? I like to give also like client giveaways sometimes, ask them for the referral. I'm heavy on like no one's going to give you something if you don't ask for it. So I will strategically ask my clients for a referral. If they know, hey, if you know anyone else that's looking to get a multi unit and become a landlord like you, I would love to have a conversation with them. When it comes to again, my lenders, my lenders refer me heavily because I'm giving them a lot of quite a few referrals, but also they know that the service level that I'm going to provide to that referral is something that's going to reflect well on them as well. So I always follow up with all referrals. I'm sure to thank my clients when they give me a referral and so I would say that my system around referrals is pretty strong. Why did you decide to create such a strong referral system? I saw the value, right? Yeah, I mean, that's the best way. I would say that was, that has been my most profitable way into the business was the referrals. Yeah, yeah, you don't have to sell yourself when somebody else is sold you and referred you to an opportunity. That's awesome. I like it. Okay, so that gives us a productivity quadrant score of 21. Let's move into growth. So as a function of growth, database is one of the most important components of the business. So when we talk about database, I don't just talk about do you have one? I don't just talk about is it in a CRM? We're talking about how do you interact with your database? What's the health of your database? Do you know the addresses of all the people in your database? Do you engage with your database on a regular basis scale from one to 10? How would you rate your database? I would rate an eight. Eight. And what does an eight look like? So for me, you mentioned something great, which was a daily follow up. Sometimes people look at social media as a lead gen, which it is, but truly my social media is me interacting with my database on a daily basis. I can go to their Facebook, oh my god, you just had a birthday. Even without having to remember it, I can see it. Facebook is going to tell me, I just got a new dog. I'm having an event at a dog park. Come on out, bring your dog. I'm going to be able to see, oh, you like dogs from your social media, right? From your Facebook. So again, that's giving me a daily touch point with my database with my social media. I also like to do, like I said, client giveaways. You'll see me on social media like, hey, I want to give someone a hundred dollars to go to a restaurant that they love. I'll do those sporadically throughout the year. I do handwritten notes to my clients and send out like little Starbucks gift cards. I also make sure I'm tracking my database frequently, right? So I go at least probably once a week and go through all the people that I've come in contact with and kind of just follow up and say, hey, haven't heard from you in a while. I just want to see what's going on. I am actively working my database on a pretty much daily, if not weekly, like schedule. Awesome. Awesome. Awesome. Let's move into vendor partners. So you mentioned lenders and you mentioned getting referrals from some of your vendor partners previously. When we talk about vendor partners, I'm not just talking about your list of preferred vendors or those three names that you give out every time somebody asks you for a reference. I'm talking about the vendors that are truly partnered with you. I'm talking about they have expectations of you. You have expectations of them. I'm talking about the collaboration, the providing resources, whether it be time, money or otherwise, the system of showing them appreciation, the system of replacing them when they need to be replaced, scale from one to 10. How would you rate your vendor partners? Definitely a nine on that one. Nine on the vendor partners. Tell me about your vendor partner system. I run a tight ship and they run a tight. So actually this year, Yumi Group has launched something unique, I would say, as it pertains to getting in front of our database on a monthly basis. So within that, we've asked our vendor partners that we've been giving our business to for the last five or six years to have a more active approach to how they continue to help us grow the database and work the database, right? So at the beginning of the year, we let our vendor partners know what our goals were and how we want to see them be a part of those goals. It's more than just, oh, can you sponsor? Can you give us $500 so we can do this? No, we want our vendor partners to be present. We want our vendor partners to be relatable. We want our vendor partners to be active at the events. And then as a result, we always are rewarding our vendor partners with either again, those solid referrals. We like to take our vendor partners out like, hey, we're doing a big event. We do a big event at the end of the year, the celebration event. We like to have our vendor partners there. So we have a very strong relationship with the vendor partners that we ask to partner with us, but we're also very strategic on not everybody can be our vendor partner. Some people will say, oh, yeah, I'll give you money. I'll give you money. But it's like, no, it's more than that. Who do you actually want to work with? Because you have to close deals with these people. So we're very particular about who we allow on to be our vendor partners. Some people are going to, you know, say, hey, I want to assist you, but eventually some of them may fall off. And that's just the truth. We want to be aligned with people that have a similar goal and a similar vision to the human group. And so that's what we're always looking for in our vendor partners. Yeah, it is more than how much money can you give or how many open houses can you sponsor? It is who are you? What is your belief? What are your vision? What are your what's your value system? What's your culture? And is that an alignment with you as an as an organization? Excellent. Let's move to personal growth. So personal growth is just that it is working on the six inches between your ears. Or it is also physical. Some people look at physical growth as part of the personal growth journey. Either way, it requires commitment. It requires a system. It requires focus. It requires effort. It requires you putting the time into reading or meeting with mentors or coaches or going to the gym or the things that really focus on growing you. Scale from one to 10. How would you rate personal growth as a part of your business? I'd say I'm at a seven. Okay. What makes that a seven? I have a very scheduled routine when it comes to my workout. So I have had a personal trainer for the last two and a half years and even prior to me using him, I had someone else as a personal trainer. As DJ mentioned, I'm a former division one athlete. So I'll be honest with you. If I never saw a sport again, I would be okay. Trust me. But I realized that it is a severe part of my my dedication and just like my mental health to stay on that regimen, to give me like a little outlet as well. So I'm very particular about my physical health. In terms of my reading, I am a student of the game. I like to learn a lot, but I really like to learn more so on the like one-to-one basis situation. Kind of what Danielle was mentioning in the last earlier part of the session, where I will volunteer my time and say, hey, I just want to learn from you. Like I want to see how you did that. And I'm willing to not have to be paid to do it. I am willing to just partner because I know that that mental growth is going to happen from me, emulating the people that I find inspirational. I am trying to get better though right now into kind of reading my daily devotionals when it comes to actually like my religious beliefs. I believe it keeps me kind of grounded and centered. So I do start my day every day with reading a daily devotional now. Excellent. What happens if you miss a miss a day of the daily devotional of the exercise of the meeting with the personal trainer? I mean, what happens if you skip a beat? Your mind just kind of, it's like you feel rush. You don't feel like the routine is going to help you like center yourself. So I would say again, like especially with the daily devotional reading it every morning, I read it at the same time every morning, like I'm locked into it and it kind of just sets the tone for the day. Okay. Does that have an impact on your time management or priority management? It's starting to. Okay. Interesting how those things intertwine, isn't it? Yeah. Let's move into the systems quadrant transaction management. So this is from the point that you put a property under contract until it goes to close. It's all of the things in between all the stuff that has to happen in order to make a transaction successful. And I'm not just talking about the mechanics of it. I'm more so talking about the experience. I'm talking about the systems. I'm talking about the consistency. I'm talking about the leverage. How little time do you actually have to spend in transaction management? Scale from one to 10. How would you rate your transaction management as a system? Well, that's a, that's a little bit of a way to, I would say maybe I was thinking in eight before you said how little time do I spend? So then I'm thinking, okay, am I at a six? Because if you ideally want to be spending less time in the transaction management or not, right? So I guess maybe we'll settle and I'll put a seven for that one too, because it's like right in the middle. I pride myself with my clients being able to kind of be accessible to them, right? So I don't have a transaction coordinator. I've never had anyone else step in and handle my transactions. I have a very routine approach to dealing with the front end of my client. So most of the time, the majority of the work does come in on the transaction management side of things. So I prefer a more hands on approach actually. I like to be able to touch base with my clients every two, three days and say, hey, this is where we are. We're one step away from the closing table. We're three steps away. So yeah, I'll set on a seven on that one. How would leveraging that out more impact your business? I think it's the control freak in me that just won't allow me to get to that point yet. Okay. Yeah. Alright. Client care. So when we talk about client care, we don't necessarily talk about during the transaction. This is more of the entire experience, right? From the moment that you meet them through identifying that they have a need for business through the transaction and then beyond the transaction. I like to equate that to if your business is a club, what does it feel like to be a member of your club? So on a scale from one to 10, how would you rate your client care? You mean you're a bit sitting over here. Okay. Like this is where we pride ourselves. I know when I got into the business, that was my immediate like I want to give people more than just a transaction. I was like if people know me from like when I first got in the industry, they know me as the girl who was on Facebook going live on Facebook. Like hey cousin, like that was literally me to my clients or my future clients or prospect clients because I want all of my clients to feel like they are family to me. I will treat you like the same way I would treat my mom. I would treat you the same way. You know, your your mom, I would treat your mom the way I would treat my mom, right? So my clients immediately have a different level of trust, I think that buying an investment property, I think can sometimes even be a little bit scarier than finding a buying a home because now you're responsible for not just your lifestyle but also the lifestyle of your tenants. And so I want to help my clients bring their guards down because there are like they're like on a 20,000 before they meet me. But when they meet me and they're like oh my gosh, you are really making this feel like I can do it. Then I know I've already won. I've already closed the deal. Okay. All right. And what is the biggest reward to having such a high focus on client care? Oh my gosh, it's so cyclical to all of this, right? So the referrals are going to come back around, you know, events just building a club, it's going to come back around. I'm going to continue to grow personally because I believe it or not love people, right? So the more people I get to interact with and hang out with, like that's my personal growth. I mean, it's just if I wasn't, I live in my purpose when I'm doing this, that's the truth. And so by giving my clients that high level of care and precision, like that makes me sleep good at night. I don't go to bed with anxiety, like did I do enough? As long as I know my clients were like felt value from their interaction with me, I'm like perfect. This is bringing joy to my life. Okay. Let's switch to follow up. So follow up is that sacred time in between identifying somebody to talk to and them deciding to do business with you, i.e. sign a listing agreement, a buyer brokerage agreement, etc. It's that middle time where there's opportunity one way or the other and follow up needs to be very systematized. It needs to be very consistent. It needs to be very leveraged because they say fortune is in the follow up. Gail from one to 10, how would you rate your follow up? Eight. Okay. What are the main strengths of your follow up system? I don't like to follow up with people and be like, oh remember you said like last March, you're next March you're going to be ready to buy a house. I don't follow up with my clients in that way. I like to follow up with my clients again on their personal life. Right. So I'll give a good example. I have a client right now. He originally he's been following me on social media for quite some time. I've been seeing him, you know, nine times I've attended people kind of my social media. They're kind of looking for like that thing, right, which is investing in a multi unit. So I noticed he'd been following me. I'll go and I'll like his post, right. I'm not going to be scared to make the first move because that's going to break the ice and then he's going to be like, okay, cool. Like she's she's not. She's friendly. So that's my first little follow up. As soon as we I see them initially tag going to me, I'm like, okay, let me see what's going. I go into their page and I kind of like to see their likes and their interest. What do we have in common? Right. So this particular client that I'm bringing up, he is a basketball coach for my former high school. And he, you know, has been following me. He's like, I know a few people that you've worked with. We went, I didn't even realize he went to my high school or worked in my high school initially when we kind of had some conversations. But now as he's working through like, okay, I had an initial conversation with you. I think I want to start getting pre-approved. I follow up with him on the basis of, oh my god, I just saw you guys kill it in that game over the weekend. Like amazing. I'm not saying, oh, are you ready yet? Are you ready to get a pre-approval yet? No, I'm following up on like, you know, I want to put my son in basketball like, what programs are you recommending? Or oh, I'm doing an event next month. We're going to be like looking out of sweet at the Bulls game. I would love it if you came through. You know, so like my follow-ups again are persistent, but not in the persistent way that you would traditionally think, where it's like, oh, are you ready to buy or sell yet? What resonates with me is that your follow-up is relationship-based, not transactional-based. Yeah. Okay. All right. Let's move into the profitability quadrant. So the first component of profitability is net worth. And when I talk about net worth, I am not saying, do you have all the money that you want to have? Okay. When I'm talking about within the net worth, there's number one, do you know what your net worth is? Number two, do you have an active strategy to grow your net worth? Number three, do how much of your income is passive versus active? Number four, how well do you track and who holds you accountable to growing your net worth? And then finally, do you feel that you are where you should be at this chapter in your life? Scale from one to 10, how would you rate your net worth? I would say I'm about at eight on networks. Okay. I do know what my net worth is because I constantly am kind of tracking it. You know, as you guys know, I'm more than just like a real estate agent, I'm also an investor, right? So when I start looking at my profitability, I also look into why, like my assets that I currently own and what I'm looking to continue to acquire. So I use my real estate business, obviously, as like my job, you know, this is my tool to continue to build assets and along the way, I'm helping other people do the same thing. So again, I do keep track of my net worth. I'm constantly working on growing my net worth. I know sometimes as a real estate agent, we can pull away from ourselves to put it so much into our clients, but I really like to say, like, laser focus on to continue to build my portfolio as well. In addition to investment properties, are there any other revenue streams or income generating streams that you have or are looking to grow? Well, I did try, you know, like crypto a little bit, but I'll be honest, I like to watch my money grow on the dirt. I really do. I feel like it's the most tangible, like I can see it growing, but I'm open, right? I tell everybody, like if there's another investment strategy that I'm missing, I would totally be down, but like my family, like, invests in real estate. So it's like, I'm used to seeing that money in the dirt. Okay. All right. Let's talk about your budget. So your budget is knowing how much it's going to cost for your organization to survive for the next three to six months. Your budget includes projections for growth or decline. Your budget should include projections for expenses, additional leverage, new systems as you continue to grow your organization. When I talk about budget as a system, I talk about not only do you have a budget, but how often do you review your budget who looks at your budget and holds you accountable to your budget? Scale from one to 10. How would you rate your budget? I would say seven. Seven. Okay. What would it take to get your budget rating from a seven to a nine? Probably more digging into it a little bit more. It's passive. It's not something that I'm looking at on a very prominent basis. I just know that I'm doing events or doing things that I'm not having to pay for. So those are things where I'm like, okay, I'm it's still a solid budget. I'm not coming out of pockets of foot expenses in the business, but I'm not watching it or maybe like a monthly basis or I know some agents that are super like honed into their budget. I spit this so I need to get this out of it. I'm not at that level yet, but I don't have to come out of my pocket for anything really related to my business right now. Okay. And then let's talk about the PNL. So if the budget's looking forward, the PNL is looking backwards. If the budget is telling you what you plan to spend, the PNL is telling you what you spend. And when we talk about PNL, I talk about not only do you have one, not only do you review it, but how systematized is your review, how leveraged is it, how much time do you have to put into allocating or classifying expenses or doing things of that nature, who holds you accountable to your PNL and compares your PNL to a budget on a month or a quarterly basis. Scale from one to ten, how would you rate the PNL component of your business? I'm going to go right back to the time management side of things and give it a four. Okay. And why a four? I've never written out a PNL. I've reviewed it a few times, you know, if you're Keller Williams, you know. So I've reviewed what a PNL looks like, but again, I think because I don't see like me losing any money doing the business. I don't feel as like tied to looking at a PNL statement because it's like, I know I have lost in money because I'm spent in money, you know. Okay. Okay. So as we look at the agent wheel overall, do you feel that this is an accurate representation of where your business stands today? Yeah, but it looks pretty good. What stands out to you? Well, the wheel itself is very intertwined with one another each positioning. So it's kind of like if you look at on this side, on this side, okay, they like balance each other like they're usually around about the same score, except for the client care in the time management. Thank goodness the time management hasn't started impacting the client care yet yet. But all these things are very, again, they're cyclical. So you're going to have kind of that reflective view of each place. When you're falling short, you're going to see yourself fall short in the other component that's kind of reflective of it. Yeah, yeah, absolutely. What stands out to you as far as the biggest opportunity right now, not opportunity for the next 12 months or five years, but today, if there was an opportunity that you felt would have the biggest impact in your business, where would that opportunity lie? I would say on the productivity. Okay, more specifically, which one of those three components? Time management. The time management. So why would time management, how would improving time management change your world? Oh, leaps and bounds. I think if I had better time management, I would be able to execute on the things that are the side of the business that I don't want to work on. For example, the profitability standpoint, like that's kind of like a time strung you, like it requires you to sit down at your desk and work on your business. I'm super used to still working in my business. So if I'm able to improve my time management to take a little bit of time from inside to looking outside, that would be ideally the goal to grow even more. So what I'm hearing is that time management, improve time management, would also give you the ability to focus more on the profitability quadrant. And so what would be the first step in improving your time management? Well, Brent, no, that's what I'm asking you for. No, I would say the first step for me is got, I think it's going to be boundaries. Okay. And what does boundaries look like? What are some boundaries that you need to reset? Some main boundaries that I would probably reset would just be, again, not agreeing to do everything on someone else's time and more so agreeing to do things on my time. Okay. And so what would the steps be in order to reset those boundaries? Hmm. Maybe have a better conversation when it comes to expectation. And conversation with who? My clients, my kids, my referral partners, you know, just my partner, my husband, right? I'm balancing a lot of different things and I have to manage everyone's expectation because when people have mismanaged expectations, that's the biggest result of like a negative feeling for people. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, that's the gap between expectations and reality is where resentment and pain when it lives, right? Mm-hmm. Okay. In addition to expectations, if there was one more thing that you could do to improve your time management, what would it be? Probably to get over my anxiety and actually write stuff down. Like, look at it, put it on paper and like follow a more strict regimen. Okay. All right. So if it's not on your calendar, it doesn't exist type of situation. Yeah. Okay. All right. Is there something, and is there anything that as it relates to our conversation today? And this may be a little bit of a leading question. I'll cheat. Is there anything that you could see would be something that would be valuable for you to go ahead and put on your calendar on a regular and consistent basis because you know that it's an area that you need to put more focus into? Um, well, like I say, probably with the P&L, I should probably be taking a look at it. I'm going to say once a year, right? Let me at least start with once. That definitely wouldn't need to go on there. Do you usually look at that around tax time? I leave it all up to the higher ups. Like, I don't deal with it at all. Okay. All right. I probably should start digging in a little bit. So now that it is tax time, would this be a good opportunity for you to have implemented review time frame for your P&L? Absolutely. Yeah. Okay. All right. All right. So I hear boundaries. I hear time blocking, putting specific things on the calendar. If there was a third thing that you could do in order to improve or move the needle on time management, what would it be? I really feel like although the big two things. Okay. May I make a recommendation? Please. I improve your prioritization. Are you familiar with the Eisenhower metrics or the four quadrants of prioritization? I'm not. Okay. So there's a concept called the Eisenhower metrics that talks about how urgent an activity is and how important it is that you do it. And when you think about activities that are very urgent and very important that you do it, then that falls into the first quadrant, the first D, which is due. If it's an activity that's urgent, but it's not important that you do it, that falls into the second quadrant, which is delegate. If it's a project or task that is important for you to do, but it's not urgent, then that falls into the third quadrant, which is delay. IE, put it on your calendar time, blocking hour down the road to work on it. And then finally, that fourth quadrant, if it's not important that you do it, and it's not urgent that you do it, delete. Get it off of your list. Put it in that someday. I'll do it sometime when I don't have anything better to do. But if you use that prioritization metrics in every moment that somebody comes to you and they say, I need you to do this. I need you to do that. Or you even go to yourself and say, you know what? Maybe I should do something. If you throw it through that Eisenhower metrics quadrant, then that will help you perfect your prioritization skills. And I find that time management is not a time management issue. We can't manage time. The 24 hours are going to come and go regardless of what you do about it. It is prioritization management. And when we can better effectively manage our priorities, then we can create those boundaries. We can prioritize the things that are most important and most urgent. And the rest of the stuff, yeah, we fit it into that white space as we can. So Melanie, anything else that I can do, have I brought you some value? Have I helped you identify a couple of gaps that might move your business forward? Yeah, I like this wheel. I haven't come across it before, even with my own personal coaching. So this is interesting. And it's good to analyze your business in this way. So I like that. And Melanie, or do you have a team? Are you moving towards having the team? So I do have a team, but it's just right now we're in Duol. It's myself and my co-founder, unique Gil. And so we start UME Group in 2022. And we have not brought on any additional support agents or TCs or anything like that. I would say it's something that we've discussed, but again, we're controlled for each. So I understand. Well, I tell you, I have a similar conversation or exercise that I lead brokers and owners and team leaders through, even aspiring team leaders, because sometimes looking at it from a team leader perspective can help you maybe identify what six, 12 months needs to look like in order to move towards that trajectory. If you would like, I would be happy to schedule a conversation as a follow up to this as a way of thanking you for the time today. I'd be happy to schedule a conversation and follow up and maybe walk you through that exercise. I love that. Absolutely. And to everybody else, if you have completed your agent wheel, if when we went through this conversation, you completed, you scored all your 12 areas of your business. And you would like to have a conversation about that. I'm going to ask that you go ahead and send me an email. It's Brent at TLRNation.com Brent B-R-E-N-T at TLRNation.com. If you send me an email with your agent wheel scores, then I will arrange for a one-on-one conversation with one of our locker room coaches to talk about your agent wheel and maybe identify some paths forward. So, Mel, I appreciate your time today. Is there anything else that I can do to bring value to you today? No, I think you did an amazing job. I would just say I didn't write down my my score. I'd love to have it. So if you guys maybe screenshot or something. I'm innocent. I'm a send you your wheel after we end our conversation. Perfect. Awesome. Thank you, Mel. I appreciate your time. DJ, thank you so much for the opportunity to lead this conversation. Thank you both Brent and Melanie. I hope everyone was following along. And if you did or even if you didn't, the agent wheel is here in the chat. We will also email that out to everybody after the presentation. And everyone Brent has just invited all of us to do this process. We all have areas of our business that we can improve. So send an email to Brent at TLRNation.com. There is put that in the chat and schedule time to get your own personal agent wheel. It's an amazing thing. I was following along and I'll tell a quick story too. I was just yesterday having a doing an interview with a this reminded me because of Melanie's athletic past. I was doing an interview with a professional former professional skier. And she was a freestyle skier. She was in the ex-games and she was very prominent. She had an injury that she had to end her career in her 20s. And now she's a top luxury agent in Denver. And I was asking her how she made the transition. And she said, the coaching is all she's ever known. She's been on skis since she was a little girl. She grew up in Breckenridge. So she's always had coaches. And that she said, I wouldn't have gotten to the ex-games without coaching. She said, I wouldn't get to where I'm at now in my business without a coach. In fact, she goes, I have two business coaches that I hire. So we know that coaching that every athlete, you know, Melanie has had coaches her whole life. And of course, everyone should have a coach as well. There's always things coaches can see that we can't. And having that other perspective of, you know, somebody that can help you where you're getting stuck is boy, it is so invaluable. You can't do it all yourself nor should you try. You need help. So I have a coach. And of course, Melanie has coaches. And we encourage all of you to have a coach as well. So shoot that email over to Brent at TLRNation.com. And we will, Brett will follow up with you and get you into one of his coaching sessions or somebody on his team. And also TLRNation.com is an amazing resource for brokerages. If there's anyone out there who doesn't have a great coaching system at their own brokerage, take a look to see what they offer. Talk to your managing broker. We've employed that here at KL Realty, the locker room. It is awesome. I can't even tell you how great it is. It has taken our training and coaching to a totally different level. I mean, we surveyed a bunch of programs before we landed on the locker room. And it just blew us away. So check them out. They're amazing TLRNation.com. Brent, once thanks again, Melanie. Thank you for your honesty, your vulnerability, and your dedication to this business. You are an inspiration. And I'm also a friend of unique. So I'm a friend of your partner. I love you. Unique. She is as lovely as you are. And what a great team what you guys are. I forgot you guys were team members. So I'm so glad that you mentioned that. All right, guys, we will take a short break. We will be back in 10 minutes. Thanks, Mel. Thanks coach, Brett. Thank you so much. Thanks guys.
