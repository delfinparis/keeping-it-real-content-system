[00:04:46] welcome to the show. Thank you so much for having me. I'm really excited to chat with you.
[00:04:51] I'm excited to chat with you as well. You will be our first TikTok agent. I know you're
[00:04:56] a really a TikTok agent, but somebody who's doing well on TikTok. We've done 500 some episodes.
[00:05:03] This is a really fun one for us. But before we get to today, let's go all the way back to the
[00:05:08] beginning. I'd love to hear about why you got into real estate, how you got into real estate,
[00:05:13] what that process was like for you. Amazing. Thanks again for having me. I'm excited to be here.
[00:05:20] I got my real estate license in August of 2000. That's almost 23 years ago. I cannot believe it.
[00:05:29] Moved to New York in 1996 after receiving my Master's of Fine Art degree from Carnegie Mellon
[00:05:34] in the Moscow Art Theatre School in acting. I came to New York and I'm getting these
[00:05:40] dailies from these messages. Let me turn that back. What was the intention to be an actor?
[00:05:45] That was the pattern. Yeah, the intention was to be an actor, but I immediately started
[00:05:49] directing plays. I adopted this play from this Russian novella about a stray dog who gets turned
[00:05:56] into a man by this mad scientist and runs around the city killing cats. That play won a number of
[00:06:04] awards. At the time, I was working for different Broadway producers who encouraged me to get rid of
[00:06:13] my admin job, helping them do their creative endeavors and working on their shows and just to
[00:06:20] pursue my own dreams. For my day job, I went and got my real estate license. There were a couple
[00:06:26] other actors that I had worked with and directed in plays who just got their real estate license.
[00:06:31] I got my real estate license. This was in 2000. I think I was 29, almost 30 years old.
[00:06:41] I started working with a friend who was an actress who was one of the creators of this musical
[00:06:47] called the 25th Annual Putnam County Spelling Bee, which is ran on Broadway once.
[00:06:51] Oh, yeah. That was a big one. I produced all over and I had a theater company with her and a
[00:06:56] couple other people who created that show, including this guy Dan Fogler, who's an actor. He's on all
[00:07:01] the fantastic beasts and where they come from movies. He played Francis Ford Coppola and the offer.
[00:07:06] It was recently on Paramount Plus. He's an amazing guy and great actor. We have this theater company.
[00:07:13] When I wasn't directing plays, I was teaching. I was also walking dogs. I was also
[00:07:20] doing coaching, proctors, and I was running around all over New York City, renting the least
[00:07:28] expensive apartments that you could actually ever find. From down in the East Village and the
[00:07:35] Lower East Side, all the way up to 214th Street in Harlem. I directed a lot of plays between 2000
[00:07:44] and I would say 2008. I probably directed 30 shows. I worked with actors like Jessica Chastain
[00:07:53] and her final show at Juilliard. She was in the same class as Michael Yurrie, who's now on
[00:07:59] show on HBO. They worked together and I directed them and their final show at Juilliard.
[00:08:06] Directed Jeremy Strong, who's one of the lead actors in succession in his first professional
[00:08:12] play in New York, as well as a couple other shows. Some other amazing actors who've gone on to
[00:08:17] win Tony's, Emmys, and Oscars. That was what I was doing while I was renting these tiny little
[00:08:24] apartments. Eventually, I didn't have to walk the dogs or teach in elementary schools. I was
[00:08:32] only directing and then when I finished a show, I'd go back to real estate and make a bunch of
[00:08:39] money doing that. It was really fun. It was a great lifestyle. I got to set my own hours. I enjoyed
[00:08:48] exploring the city and finding my way into a lot of these incredible apartments.
[00:08:57] And sorry about that. I'm going to turn my... Are you still there? I'm here.
[00:09:05] Okay. Sorry for these technical difficulties here. I'm a real estate agent, not the greatest
[00:09:18] computer guy. So let me just as we... As we're paused here, I'm just going to turn this off.
[00:09:32] Yeah, we're really lucky. So my office here in our office here, the company office, is actually just
[00:09:37] down the street from the Steppenwolf Theater here in Chicago. So we're very, very fortunate to be
[00:09:43] that close to the greatness of Steppenwolf. And my coworker who acts as if it's behind me is a big
[00:09:49] step in Wolf guy. And so he goes to see a lot of... We both go to see quite a few productions.
[00:09:53] Oh, that's amazing. I love the Steppenwolf company. I follow them. I've never been to Chicago,
[00:09:58] but definitely all the incredible actors who've come out of there. And so just to get back on track,
[00:10:04] so I was directing plays and I was doing real estate. And after a while, I took a little break
[00:10:10] from directing shows and tried to save up a bunch of money. And went full, full, full into real estate.
[00:10:19] Didn't really do anything else. I spent like six months just trying to save up as much as I can.
[00:10:25] And I was renting... I rented about a hundred apartments that year.
[00:10:32] And...
[00:10:32] By the way, can I pause you for a second?
[00:10:34] Because New York City rentals are very different from most other cities where... And I don't know
[00:10:39] that this was the case in all of 100 rentals, but I'm sure it was at least some of them.
[00:10:44] Whereas in most cities, the landlords or the management companies or the owners of the
[00:10:49] property paid commissions, but in New York, it's not uncommon that the tenant actually pays the
[00:10:54] REALTOR commission. Was that the case for a certain percentage of your... By the way, that just
[00:10:59] seems like a difficult... That's a difficult thing to ask for, at least for all of us that don't
[00:11:05] ever have to ask that question of our renters. So my hat's off to you, because that is a tough one.
[00:11:11] Yeah, so in New York City, the tenants always paid the commission at that time.
[00:11:16] I worked with about 10 landlords that between them owned about 2,000 buildings.
[00:11:23] And we didn't co-broke at all. We only did... We only worked with ourselves.
[00:11:34] And so the landlords didn't want us to co-broke and they were... They didn't ever want to pay the fee,
[00:11:38] so we only charged the tenants the fee. So I would show... We had about 350 units at that time.
[00:11:45] Can you hear these dings? No, no. We can't hear them. So you're good.
[00:11:49] Oh, you can't hear them. So it's just a tough thing. No, no, you're totally good.
[00:11:54] You're a busy writer. You get lots of dings. That's what happens.
[00:11:57] In my wife at this point. So I had about 350 vacancies at any given time.
[00:12:05] And I would... If someone didn't like apartment number one, I'd have two, three, four, and five to show them.
[00:12:12] Then eventually I'd... One of them they would love. I would take them to the bank. This is what we
[00:12:16] used to be able to do in these days. We kept doing this and we don't do this today. But I'd take
[00:12:20] them to the bank and have them fill out an application. I would take a deposit. I would write them a
[00:12:25] receipt and I would take the apartment off the market for them and the apartment would basically be
[00:12:30] theirs. And then I would take them to a like a cookie place and get them some cookies. I did that
[00:12:36] for about eight years, renting a between 120 to 150 apartments a year.
[00:12:42] And it was like 12 hours a day, seven days a week waking up and pounding the pavement.
[00:12:49] I never went into the office except when I needed to hand in commission checks. And it was
[00:12:54] it was really fun. I remember those days as just a great time. I still stayed connected to all of
[00:13:02] my theater and entertainment folks and started then helping them find apartments to rent and eventually
[00:13:08] to buy. And it was nice because I was able to make a living to pay my rent to not stress out about
[00:13:19] where the next utilities bill is going to come from. I started out crashing on a friend's house
[00:13:29] on a friend's couch in Hoboken, New Jersey after I broke up with my girlfriend in downtown New
[00:13:35] York and didn't have a place to live. So I was all my stuff was in a Manhattan mini storage and I
[00:13:40] would commute into the city. I would go to the Manhattan mini storage. I would get in my dog walking
[00:13:46] attire. I'd walk the dogs and I'd go back into my real estate showing attire and I'd show apartments
[00:13:51] all over the city. And eventually I saved enough money to get my own apartment. I was sleeping on
[00:13:57] the floor in a sleeping bag until I rented enough apartments to get a bed. Then I got a bed.
[00:14:02] That was like a huge improvement. And I just really like was tired of the ups and downs of a theater
[00:14:12] career. It's a very much a feast and for famine type of career. And just hyper focused when I was
[00:14:20] working on a play. It was my life. I couldn't think of anything else like that I was supposed to do
[00:14:27] when I was working on a show. But then the show would be over and I would come back to reality and
[00:14:32] think, oh my god, like, how am I going to pay my rent now? And I would be freaking out and have to
[00:14:38] run out and rent a bunch of apartments really fast. So that lifestyle wasn't really great for my
[00:14:44] anxiety levels. Sure enough. The crazy world of real estate is fine for my anxiety levels.
[00:14:50] Ah, oddly enough, you found the one with the one industry that's more stressful than real estate.
[00:14:56] Yeah. Yeah, exactly. But the thing with real estate is I feel like you get as much out of it
[00:15:03] as you put into it. With theater and stuff, you could put a million things into it. And there's
[00:15:09] so many things outside of your competence level or outside of your talent level that have
[00:15:19] that play into it. With real estate, you know, I've found I'm a people person. I've always been a
[00:15:25] people person. I love working with people, helping people. I love the city. I like transact and I like
[00:15:32] negotiating. And I'm able to bring a creativity to it. So I'm still able to bring that part of myself
[00:15:41] to my job. And so I've just found like if I take that exact same work ethic of being able to
[00:15:49] pour myself into my work and enjoy it, that I'm able to kind of reap a reward. You know, the more
[00:15:57] people you help, the more people you're able to have a positive impact in, words, spreads, and
[00:16:02] business kind of comes back to you. So yeah. So eventually after about eight years, I
[00:16:10] met my wife. And I decided that, you know, with her encouragement that let's branch out and really
[00:16:20] focus on sales. You know, where I wouldn't have to work 12-hour days, seven days a week,
[00:16:26] pounding the pavement. I still do work 12 hours, days, seven days a week, but I'm not like pounding
[00:16:31] the streets of New York's show on apartments for 12 hours a day. A lot of my work is on my phone.
[00:16:36] A lot of my work is from the office. I do open houses every Sunday. My team, we do get rentals.
[00:16:42] I'll work on Saturdays as well. But it's a different lifestyle. It's a more
[00:16:49] predictable lifestyle. It's a more manageable lifestyle. Then, you know, when I was renting
[00:16:54] apartments, these were $800 a month studios, $1,000 a month, one bedrooms, $1200 a month, two bedrooms,
[00:17:01] and $1500 a month, three bedrooms. So I went and I just went to the bank to get like a new credit
[00:17:08] card. And I hadn't like on my personal card to have a business account and different accounts
[00:17:13] or whatever. But on my personal account, I haven't gotten like a new credit card since I built up my
[00:17:18] credit. I didn't even have credit when I was like, canton, New York, I had a 570 credit score.
[00:17:23] And I had to get a secured credit card. And I put my income down as 50,000 a year. So she comes
[00:17:29] down and she's like, so what's your income level today? And she shows me what it was when I first
[00:17:33] got the card. And I'm like, wow, you know, $50,000 a year. It was just like that was a whole different
[00:17:39] life time ago. And it was humbling. And I still see myself as that same exact guy. But now we're selling,
[00:17:48] you know, $10, $20, $30 million properties as well as properties into $300,000 because we were,
[00:17:56] I still kept that low, low budget level business and just expanded to a much higher level
[00:18:06] business as well. But I, we do it all on my team. We feel like we want to help every, like our
[00:18:11] mantras, we want to get every New Yorker a great place to live. No matter their budget, no matter,
[00:18:17] you know, we really do specialize in Brooklyn and Manhattan. So when I get people looking for
[00:18:23] in other boroughs, that Nile under Queens or something like that, I have an amazing referral
[00:18:28] network that I refer them to if we can't help them. So, um, so yeah, so that's like my trajectory.
[00:18:35] So started off in 2000, renting these crazy apartments from the East Village up to Harlem.
[00:18:40] And then in 2008 to 2010 is when things started getting more into the sales. And, and I came over
[00:18:49] to Corcoran in 2011. Wow. That's, yeah. It's quite a story. It's, I love it because you basically
[00:18:56] grinded it out and you started, you started with, with a very difficult task again, convincing
[00:19:03] renters to pay you a commission to, you know, because you had access to these properties.
[00:19:08] Is, is not an easy thing that most REALTORS ever have to ask for unless they work in New York and
[00:19:14] Boston, I think, is a little bit that way. And there's a few other cities that were, it's like,
[00:19:18] it's rare. It is rare. Yeah, New York is so different. I mean, yeah, the tenants pay the commissions
[00:19:24] when the property sells itself. A lot of times, especially during the pandemic, you know, we didn't
[00:19:30] want properties to sit around. And so the landlords would pay a commission for a small period of time.
[00:19:37] But usually if the landlord pays the commission here in New York, there's something wrong with the
[00:19:42] property. Right. There's a reason. There's a reason. And I mean, I just rented in a townhouse
[00:19:47] that I put on the market and I had it on the market for about a week. We did one showing and the
[00:19:52] first person to look at it took it, $17,000 a month and they paid the full commission.
[00:19:58] Unbelievable. Yeah. And that was like one day's worth of showings. So it's, it can get very expensive.
[00:20:09] And it just depends on the price point and, and what the particular tenant can afford. If,
[00:20:15] sure, we do also list, you know, much lower priced properties. I own some investment properties
[00:20:21] in a building up on 138th Street. And it's a different, it's a different economic level of,
[00:20:27] renter. And those, those renters, sometimes we do still offer, you know, no fee because someone
[00:20:34] who's renting a $17,000 a month apartment can afford to pay a fee. Someone who's renting a $15,000
[00:20:41] a $2,000 a month apartment, they're in a different financial situation. And so, you know, we, we,
[00:20:51] if you can, and then also I rented something recently and I don't want to just promote myself as
[00:20:57] a rental agent. We do everything. We do sales. But we rented something in Waverly Place where,
[00:21:04] you know, a lot of companies will move their employees to New York City and cover the entire
[00:21:08] moving cost. And that's what happened in that particular situation. Yeah. But it's a different,
[00:21:14] different, a different experience, the, the rental game in New York. And then to transition from that,
[00:21:19] which I know a lot of agents get stuck in the rental game because it's, yeah, it's so continuous.
[00:21:26] I was stuck in it. And I'll say that for those eight years because you get paid immediately.
[00:21:32] You get paid when the lease sign is signed. And here in New York, we want leases signed within 24
[00:21:38] hours of acceptance. So if someone, if I show someone a rental property, they want it. I send them a
[00:21:44] link within 24 hours. They're going to apply if it's a condo or a townhouse, the owner's going to
[00:21:52] approve them, usually within 24 hours. Then we want leases signed within 24 hours of that. And at
[00:21:58] that point, they're going to submit their rent security deposit and broker's fee with sales. You're
[00:22:02] getting paid, you know, 90 days from a contract signing. So if you're lucky, you'll sell something
[00:22:10] within the first three months. And then you have three more months for the deal to close to get paid.
[00:22:17] Now the market, there's not any one. It's hard to say the market here in New York City because
[00:22:23] each different neighborhood is its own sub market. So I listed a home for sale in Brooklyn Heights.
[00:22:29] And I like I said, I work all over Brooklyn in Manhattan. Brooklyn is very, very hot. And it's
[00:22:34] been hot for a while. I listed a home for $3.85 million. I did one open house. We had 30 people there.
[00:22:42] We had five offers. Every offer was all cash. The property went into contract a few days later for
[00:22:47] $4.2 million. And we closed two weeks later. Basically, we did one open house for that property. And
[00:22:55] sold for 10% above the asking price. And the whole thing lasted from like mid-January to mid-February.
[00:23:03] And then it was like pretty much finished. But that's a condo. It's a spru-teak building. The owner
[00:23:10] of the property knew the board. They encouraged them to move quickly. Management companies sometimes
[00:23:15] could take about seven days to process an application. They may have some questions back and forth.
[00:23:21] And that was a very, very quick sale transaction. They're not always that way because you're dealing
[00:23:27] with boards. Yeah. And co-op boards in particular in New York are challenging because oftentimes there's
[00:23:34] an interview process where even though everything looks good, you still got to win over the board and
[00:23:40] make sure you don't say your dog has to win over the board. Sometimes we've been in situations where
[00:23:45] co-ops accept pets on a case-by-case basis. And they actually want the dog to come in there and see
[00:23:52] how friendly the dog is. So you've got to coach your pet on the board interview as well.
[00:23:59] The pets being interviewed. I love it. Yeah. Yeah. It was funny. My sister had a, well,
[00:24:04] I can tell it story later. But my sister had a condo in the West Village. And she's,
[00:24:09] she had to go in front of the board. I mean, everything went fine. But it was, she was like, it's a
[00:24:13] weird experience. And it is. It's a funny experience. Usually if you get a board interview,
[00:24:18] you're pretty much in any way. Because if they, if you weren't in, they wouldn't even give you an
[00:24:24] interview. It's, it's very rare. I don't think it's ever even happened where I've gotten a buyer
[00:24:30] on the buyer side into a board interview and something happened and they didn't get it. Usually,
[00:24:35] you know, we have a list of, you know, top tips, tips for winning a board interview that we provide
[00:24:42] to every client. And it's very much like, you know, be yourself. Don't question the board. Just
[00:24:50] be there for their questions. You know, don't offer too much information outside of the questions.
[00:24:56] They ask you and don't look at it in any sort of like negative way. It's really like, we want to
[00:25:05] meet who our neighbor is going to be. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. Don't be the
[00:25:12] person that they go, Oh, God, that person's going to be a problem. Yeah. Don't, don't just talk
[00:25:17] about all of the work that you're ready to do on your apartment the minute you close.
[00:25:21] Because who knows that board member that you're sitting across the table from might be your downstairs
[00:25:26] neighbor, right? You know, just be like, Oh, the place is great. We might do a couple little things
[00:25:32] here and there. The board knows if you're buying a, in a state sale level property that, that the
[00:25:38] person's going to want to do work. Or if you're buying a turnkey, print, you know, pristine
[00:25:45] apartment, don't talk about how you're going to rip up the floors and put in new floors. You know,
[00:25:50] just keep it simple, keep it brief, get through it, close, and then, you know, do your thing.
[00:25:57] Well, you are not only started out as a successful leasing agent in New York and then transition to
[00:26:03] not just being working with buyers and sellers, but working really in the sort of upper levels of
[00:26:09] luxury properties. But I really don't want to talk as much about that only because you're also
[00:26:16] doing something that I have not yet found from one of our guests yet, which I'm really excited
[00:26:23] to talk about, which is I really want to talk about marketing specifically. I want to hear, I want
[00:26:27] to hear about your social media success because, and I just want to reiterate what we,
[00:26:32] but actually I didn't say this earlier. So Rania's is an incredible social media following. By the way,
[00:26:38] he's not somebody in his early 20s doing this, right, where you would expect the kind of numbers I'm
[00:26:43] about to share with you to be somebody who is, who is just skewing younger, but Rania's actually
[00:26:49] having the success as, as, you know, a man in his 40s, you know, and so I'm sorry, 50s, my apologies.
[00:26:55] I was, I was, I was, yeah, even more impressive. And he has 20,000 Instagram followers, but here's
[00:27:04] the really amazing, amazing 300,000 followers on TikTok. So I would love to talk to you about what
[00:27:10] the role of social media is in your marketing strategy, how it works, and how you think it became
[00:27:16] so, so effective for you. Yeah, I love talking about this because this is where I can really bring
[00:27:21] in my creativity because I'm a storyteller. And as we said earlier, you know, I started in the
[00:27:27] world of theater. I've had the good fortune of being an amazingly fertile group of creative artists
[00:27:35] in the early mid 90s here in New York City, actors who've gone on to win Academy Awards, Emmy Awards,
[00:27:43] Tony Awards, writers who've won Emmy Awards, nominated for Academy Awards. And I bring a lot of
[00:27:50] this creativity into my marketing. And so, you know, what we found is creating fun, engaging
[00:27:59] marketing pieces through video that connect on an emotional level, creates a very meaningful
[00:28:05] connection between myself and potential clients or just audience members. And, and it's really
[00:28:11] been effective and it's spread. You know, I always feel like if you build it, they will come. And so
[00:28:16] we've just put, you know, we've leaned into social media as a way of being able to be authentic
[00:28:23] and show my authentic self to the widest variety of people as possible. So in yeah. No, go ahead,
[00:28:29] go ahead. Yeah. So in January 2021, when we were, when we were quarantined during the pandemic,
[00:28:36] my wife and I started watching this show Emily and Terris, which I don't know if you're familiar.
[00:28:41] And in January of 2021, I called my assistant. I said, we need our own Emily and Terris.
[00:28:48] I, I don't know how to do all of this TikTok stuff, you know, Instagram. I'm just putting videos
[00:28:56] of me and my kids YouTube. I'd make these videos that were great like short films and I still do a
[00:29:03] lot of that. You know, I have some videos going on my YouTube channel at Randy Baruch. And one of
[00:29:08] my first very creative videos is Meet the Randy Baruch team, which is a comedy. It's, it's like
[00:29:14] if the office met million dollar listing with kids. And so I used my son who's like the,
[00:29:21] in an Alex P. Keaton, sorry, for his old fogey fan. Oh, I know, I know. Yeah. Of course.
[00:29:27] But, you know, it's very much done like an episode of the office where we're all talking to the
[00:29:33] camera and then the handheld is showing us at our jobs. And then it's like, and this new
[00:29:38] agent is really doing great. And it's like goes to like max and he's on the phone and he's like,
[00:29:43] listen, you want the deal or not? And it's really, really funny. And that's like a great intro to me
[00:29:48] and my team and our sets of, sense of humor and how much I love the job and stuff like that.
[00:29:53] And these YouTube videos really started taking a life of their own. And I, I did this one that
[00:29:59] looks like a Century 21 commercial from like the late 70s that's in crackling kind of video.
[00:30:05] And I have this incredible video production company called the real estate production network
[00:30:10] that I use. And they really do like, like the production levels of my videos are very much like a
[00:30:15] short film. I did one. I had a 10 million dollar townhouse and I hired a Broadway choreographer,
[00:30:21] who I know from when I used to direct the Williamson Theater Festival. And I said, I want to do a musical.
[00:30:26] And so I hired her. She got a body double. And I always like to reference old movies from the 80s and
[00:30:33] 90s. So this one was like across between American beauty where you get that scene where a net
[00:30:39] vending is cleaning the house before an open house. And she's like, yeah, yeah, yeah, this house.
[00:30:44] And she's actually, she's in her suit and she's cleaning everything. Yeah, yeah.
[00:30:48] It's across between that and the beginning of adventures in babysitting when a little bit
[00:30:52] shoe is dancing through her room getting dressed for a show. So it's basically need dancing through
[00:30:59] this 10 million dollar house cleaning the windows, fluffing the pillows, getting it ready.
[00:31:04] And tap dancing and cartwheeling. And it's amazing. The video is phenomenal. It's won some awards.
[00:31:13] It's a really was a labor of love. And it's it's joy. It's just exuding joy, joyfulness and
[00:31:20] spreading joyfulness. And it's it's a wonderful video. And I encourage people to check it out.
[00:31:24] It's called on your on my toes at 311 less Broadway. We will we will post a link to that in the
[00:31:30] show notes as well. So everyone can watch this because I need to see this. That's something. Yeah. So
[00:31:34] back in 2021, I call my assistant like we need an Emily in Paris. We hired this woman really,
[00:31:41] really cool lady. And she was like 21 years old. She's like, you got to do TikTok. I'm like great.
[00:31:48] So because I've been in the business for so long and I'm fortunate enough to have created really
[00:31:53] trusting good relationships with agents all over New York City and all price ranges. And
[00:32:01] Corcoran Sunshine is one of the biggest marketing marketers of new developments in the city.
[00:32:07] I was able to get access to a 50 million dollar apartment. So 2021 TikTok was still pretty new
[00:32:15] coming off of the pandemic, especially to people in my age range. And especially in real estate,
[00:32:21] there wasn't a lot of other people doing this. And I came up with this idea. I can like almost like
[00:32:27] lifestyles of the rich and famous from the 80s just to open a window into a different world
[00:32:32] that a lot of people don't get to see on their every day. Yeah, totally. So I called them up,
[00:32:37] they gave me access. They allowed me to shoot some video. I said, hey, and the video just starts
[00:32:42] with me saying, hey, you want to see what a 50 million dollar New York City apartment looks like?
[00:32:46] Let's go. And by the way, who doesn't want to see what the inside of a 50 million dollar apartment
[00:32:52] looks like? Everybody wants to see that. Yeah, everyone wants to see that. So we put it to some really
[00:32:57] crazy hip-hop music that the 20-year-olds like. And I'm a hip-hop fan as well. But it's like that video
[00:33:04] overnight went viral. Now since then, it's had over 5 million views. And within a week, I had about
[00:33:10] 90,000 followers. That was my first TikTok video ever. It just went crazy. Then we just expanded it.
[00:33:18] Like she knew what things to highlight, what things not to highlight. She ended up leaving me and
[00:33:28] going full time to a social media company. And then I got another social media manager. And we
[00:33:35] did a video on an off-market 25 million dollar property. That video went viral. It's so far has
[00:33:42] had 17 million views on TikTok. That went crazy. That then someone memes are asking me if I can post
[00:33:51] that on their Instagram channel. I said, yes. And overnight, I went from 5,000 Instagram followers
[00:33:57] to 20,000 Instagram followers from that memes are one. So I'll tell you how crazy it is. I was just in
[00:34:05] London. My wife's English just like last weekend. We just got back on Sunday, just last Sunday from
[00:34:13] London. We went there to for a friend's birthday. I'm at this dinner on Friday night. There was about
[00:34:19] 30 of us at the dinner. And my friends, my wife's best friends, nephew and niece were sitting next to me.
[00:34:26] He's maybe 16. I think he's 17. And the niece was 18 years old. And they're like,
[00:34:31] oh, what are you doing in New York? And I'm like, well, I work in real estate. And we were just like
[00:34:35] chit chatting. And it came up, you know, I wanted to impress them because it's like 18-year-old and 17
[00:34:41] years old. I was like, sure. I'm a TikTok channel. And they're like, oh, do you? You've got a TikTok
[00:34:46] channel. Do you? Very nice. And I'm like, actually, I have about 300,000 followers. I'm like, wow,
[00:34:51] really? I'm like, I told them, you know, I do all these crazy real estate videos. So like,
[00:34:57] let me look you up. They looked me up. And they both follow me. They're like, oh, my God, we follow
[00:35:04] you. Look, and they showed me the video of the $40, $50 million property and the $25 million
[00:35:11] property. And literally these two teenagers in London that I had just met at this dinner are
[00:35:18] our followers of mine on TikTok. Amazing. And then after that dinner, we went to another friend of
[00:35:25] my wife's house and we're chit chatting. And I'm telling his 14-year-old son, this 14-year-old
[00:35:34] daughter and 16-year-old son, the same story. Like, how crazy is it? Like, I'm big with the
[00:35:40] teenagers in London. And literally the son, the older one, the 16-year-old also follows me.
[00:35:48] Amazing. Isn't that funny? So just the reach of TikTok is absolutely amazing. And I'll tell you,
[00:35:57] it's great because it drives traffic to my Instagram channel. It allows TikToks fun because I get
[00:36:03] to be a little bit more irreverent and a little bit sillier because it skews like 16 to 24-year-old.
[00:36:09] Yeah, lower stakes there, yeah, for sure. But the sellers, they love it when I'm pitching a
[00:36:15] listing. I am very adept at reaching wide audiences. I was in New York magazine in October of 2022
[00:36:28] as a real estate influencer. It's brought me to people like yourself where I've been able to do
[00:36:36] podcasts and spread my message of how much I love to help people in their real estate journeys.
[00:36:44] And I really see no downside to it. People ask me if you've gotten business from TikTok or
[00:36:50] gotten business from Instagram. Where I can say yes because I have real estate agents who follow me
[00:36:56] on these various social media channels on YouTube, TikTok, and Instagram who've given me referrals.
[00:37:02] I just am closing one today from someone from Minnesota. I have another one from Silicon Valley,
[00:37:09] someone that I'm helping. And so yeah, absolutely I've gotten business but I don't necessarily look
[00:37:15] at Instagram and TikTok as lead generation tools. I use them as marketing tools. And the marketing
[00:37:24] helps me get more people to follow me, helps me in my lead generation to the individuals here in
[00:37:38] Mexico. I'm also interested in the community. I'm also interested in the community. I'm also
[00:37:47] 
[00:37:47] I think there's a lot going on there. I think number one of course your background and as a creative
[00:37:53] is gets put to use in a fun way that really allows you to talk up to really put these
[00:38:00] productions on and put them on social media with you know you get to write the scripts, you get to
[00:38:04] direct, you get to choreograph, you get to really make as a as a director which is what you are
[00:38:10] and where you get to do that again and cast and do all the sort of it's really you're basically doing
[00:38:16] a very similar thing but honestly like 17 million views on a video that I created. I mean I don't
[00:38:25] know what television show I can create and put on a TV channel and get 17 million viewers on it.
[00:38:32] It's I just came to their understanding and you know I was meeting and and talking with
[00:38:39] a real estate agent who is on a number of these reality shows and stuff and you know really like
[00:38:45] the person and we had a great synergy. Unfortunately I ended up not working out it wasn't the
[00:38:50] really the right thing the right time and we couldn't really figure out the best deal but I thought
[00:38:54] to myself you know what would I can create my own stuff I could create my own shows I have
[00:38:59] through social media there's billions of people out there who are interested in looking at
[00:39:05] the lifestyles of you know properties in New York City and I have a budget from Corcoran and I have
[00:39:13] a budget you know I enhanced that out of pocket and I could create these little 30 second to two
[00:39:20] minute to five minute little vignettes that are entertaining and you know I love entertaining people
[00:39:27] I love making them smile I love you know being on camera and being in front of people that's
[00:39:34] just part of my personality I'm slightly I'm like an extrovert introvert in that way but it's
[00:39:41] really allowed me to do you know enjoy myself and entertain people at the same time spread you know
[00:39:49] grow my business so yeah I love one thing that you said that even sort of surprised me because
[00:39:55] I'm so conditioned when I have guests on who talk about social media in particular it's all about
[00:40:01] how it drives business right and you were like well yes I'm sure it does and but but that's the
[00:40:06] number one that's not really why I do it it's more about my overall marketing strategy because yes
[00:40:12] maybe there aren't a lot of you know people who are buying 20 million dollar homes who are looking
[00:40:17] for their agent on TikTok however somebody in their orbit might might watch this video or they
[00:40:24] might watch this video they might get get a little chuckle and then because of how successful the
[00:40:29] videos are you know other outlets are going to pick up on how successful you are being on the social
[00:40:35] platforms and they're writing about you mentioned you know being in magazine and also winning awards
[00:40:39] and yeah all of those things it's it's all about we're really what we're talking about is branding
[00:40:44] and and you're you're getting to do something that I think most REALTORS don't don't allow
[00:40:50] themselves to do which is to be silly to be fun to be fun I mean you know even if we look at you
[00:40:56] know the photos that REALTORS use that are oftentimes 15 years old you know they don't even have fun
[00:41:02] with their photos and yeah it's a very buttoned down kind of kind of world and you're you're doing
[00:41:07] you know more of who you authentically are and it's certainly not hurting any part of your
[00:41:13] business either in fact it's helping and your reach is insane and yes and I'm able to share my
[00:41:19] knowledge so we do I work with a great social media strategist Kim Ripper of Henry Street Media who
[00:41:27] we discussed and you know she did a deep dive into all of my social media platforms and and we
[00:41:34] discussed what's working what's not working what we could do more of what we could do less of
[00:41:39] and so we temper a lot of these fun videos with educational videos where I could talk about things
[00:41:45] that are really important to buyer sellers renters and investors right now and we're working
[00:41:50] you know we're going through a very complicated complex interesting exciting time with the economy
[00:41:58] in real estate and finance and it's important to share you know my expertise my knowledge my take
[00:42:06] on things in order to help people as well so video is an incredibly effective way to reach people
[00:42:14] without getting having to get in the same room with them it's really hard like getting into the
[00:42:20] same room with a lot of people you know but I could I could text them a video of how I do my marketing
[00:42:28] I could text them a video of how I market a property or text them a video of me talking about
[00:42:34] you know how to be effective in a multiple bid situation on a buy side or a sell side
[00:42:40] and now or even or even to talk and apologize for interrupting or even right now again at the time
[00:42:46] of this taping maybe this will this will be a distant memory but maybe not but talking about hey
[00:42:52] the banks you know we've had three bank failures in the US right now and there's now discussion
[00:42:57] about how that may in fact impact rate lending rates and and again I know you know some a lot of
[00:43:04] the space that you play in loans are as maybe as common although I'm sure they're very they're very
[00:43:09] common I mean we do a lot of cash deals we do a ton of financing deals of course you know and
[00:43:16] real estate and this is me coming from a real estate guy that's one thing that I can understand
[00:43:23] to me stocks I don't have a great understanding of stocks like I don't have a great understanding of
[00:43:30] things that I can't look at look at and touch when I am looking at a home I can go in it I know
[00:43:36] that I can rent it I know that I can do a lot of things with this property and so as a matter of
[00:43:41] fact earlier today we just had an inspection on an investment property that I'm buying in Pennsylvania
[00:43:47] because I'm feeling like what do I want my money sitting in a bank right now better better to put
[00:43:52] it in a property where I can get a rents people will always need a place to live rents my and
[00:43:57] the K one every year to help yeah exactly exactly and so you know there's to me in my
[00:44:07] experience of 23 years of doing this you know real estate's always been if you understand it if
[00:44:14] you have a good you know advice from a financial manager from a CPA and a great real estate agent
[00:44:20] um you know it's always been a very um good way place to put your money and again you could look
[00:44:29] at it you could fix it up you can add value to it you know there's a ton of things and there's
[00:44:34] tax benefits to it as well so you know the video stuff is it's one thing to have all the fun which
[00:44:41] I love doing and again like when I meet someone that's him cold calling someone or prospecting on
[00:44:47] the phone I'm calling a past client or I'm calling a place in my geographic farm they might not
[00:44:54] read all my postcards they might not pick up the phone every time I call but if I text in the video
[00:44:59] that's 30 seconds long they're probably going to look at it but you know what we do all three so I'm
[00:45:05] sending a postcard with a QR code that links to the video that takes them to my website then I'm
[00:45:13] taking that same video I'm dividing it up into 30-second snippets you're clipping it out yeah
[00:45:19] yeah and clipping that out on my social media and then everything then comes back to the property if
[00:45:25] I'm selling that property so all of that helps the property is SEO which will push it higher in a
[00:45:31] Google search and so you know we're we do it all we do print we do video we do digital ads we have
[00:45:40] our website I pick up the phone and call and everything is connected and everything links together
[00:45:46] so that we're really you know reaching people everywhere where they're looking and where they're
[00:45:53] seeing and and it's it's a great way for them to get to get to know me because someone you know
[00:46:00] you call someone up there at work they might not have 10 minutes or even five minutes to like
[00:46:05] chit chat with you and get to know you on the phone but then when I shoot them a text and I say
[00:46:09] hey this is Randy from the courtroom group it was such a pleasure chatting with you please give me a
[00:46:14] ring whenever you're free then they can see my face they can hear my voice it's it's a it's a bit
[00:46:19] of a different connection and so quick quick question with with the text videos only because our
[00:46:23] audience would was gonna email me afterwards they say why didn't you ask this are you using like
[00:46:29] bomb bomb or loom to make those videos are you just doing those natively through your phone or
[00:46:34] yeah you know I used to use bomb bomb and I still have an account with bomb bomb I don't use
[00:46:39] bomb bomb as much because I'm able to to do it in other ways so sometimes I'll just direct I'll
[00:46:47] just send them a text directly um I use mail chimp for my newsletters and there's videos on
[00:46:55] all my mail chimp I like driving people to my website because I'm able to capture a lot of
[00:47:02] their information when they go on my website so when I'm sending a postcard we'll use a QR code
[00:47:08] that links to my website I don't even use business cards anymore I use this um flow code yeah
[00:47:15] flow code just on my phone and whenever I'm meeting people are the convention or on the street
[00:47:21] or wherever and they're like do you have a card I'm just like just take a picture of my flow code
[00:47:25] then my contact information comes up with links to all of my different social media channels and
[00:47:30] it's much better than always remembering a card I do have one card that I carry around with
[00:47:36] my flow code on the back too and if someone wants a card then I give them that card I'll put a
[00:47:40] couple more cards in my wallet as well but um ready I have to say from it's funny your energy is
[00:47:47] not only infectious but but I'll I'll tell you the the sort of the vibe I'm getting and I don't
[00:47:53] even like that word but it's it's an embarrassing word that I wish I had a better word for but
[00:47:57] the the energy that I'm getting from you is you really really enjoy your business and you get
[00:48:03] to be creative you get to do fun things on social media and and so you get to be entertaining on
[00:48:08] social media and educational so you get to sort of do both you want to be silly and put together a
[00:48:12] fun musical you can do that uh short musical or if you want to talk about hey here's here's
[00:48:17] what's happening in the market right now that you should be aware of or hey want to see what the
[00:48:20] inside of this fancy place um you get to have a lot of fun but you're also still grinding it out
[00:48:26] in the business because that's that's the business so it seems like you have a and you have all
[00:48:31] these marketing channels working for you um you're hitting people in all mediums you're hitting them
[00:48:36] with with mailers you're hitting them with texts uh video uh social media uh your website and and
[00:48:42] you're just it seems like you're just having a lot of fun yeah it is it is a lot of fun it's always
[00:48:48] something different I have an awesome team we have an operations manager we have to uh junior agents
[00:48:55] we have a marketing assistant who's also going to be a new junior agent we have a social media manager
[00:49:00] it's really fun dealing with all of these great people who kind of help make the magic happen
[00:49:07] and and also I just love helping people helping people you know back when I was doing the theater stuff
[00:49:14] I loved working with actors I enjoyed being a director more than being an actor because being a
[00:49:19] director you have a you're responsible for a lot of people's success um yeah you're responsible for
[00:49:25] helping them be the best versions of themselves and and getting their own success right um and
[00:49:32] taking people in a certain direction um taking the audience on a journey taking the actors and the
[00:49:38] designers and you know the these these these amazing individuals who put their faith in you
[00:49:44] on on on a on a journey to a successful place and I see my work in real estate in very much
[00:49:51] the same way when I'm hired by a seller you know I'm given a task to help them you know realize
[00:49:58] their dreams you know with the sale of this property or with the purchase of this property there's
[00:50:03] a lot of pressure on on us as real estate professionals to help the um the process go smoothly
[00:50:11] my wife's English I just said this to someone yesterday my mantra is like from Queen Elizabeth keep
[00:50:16] calm and carry on yeah let let let let let let everybody do their thing but I'm a calm calming factor
[00:50:23] in the situation and and I love negotiating I mean that's that's fun too and and because I I
[00:50:31] grinded it out so hardcore in my early years I have that grinding mentality I mean if you're
[00:50:38] trying to make it in New York in anything especially acting directing writing the creative arts
[00:50:46] you've got to grind it out if you're getting into real estate you know a lot of these real estate shows
[00:50:52] they make it seem so easy but they make it seem so easy because the the people on these shows
[00:50:58] have already reached a level in their careers that allowed them to be on the show and make it
[00:51:03] look easy the behind the scenes is like a little hamster in a wheel like running running running
[00:51:08] that's like going on inside me like all the time sure and uh and you know it's it's tough it
[00:51:15] takes work you don't get paid right away in sales and you've got to constantly be looking in
[00:51:21] in all directions you know every single day come to the office and we're like okay how many people
[00:51:27] can I call today how many appointments can I make today how many New Yorkers can I help today
[00:51:32] you know it's not like oh I have a bunch of deals in the in the pipeline or or in contract and
[00:51:38] now I'm ready to go like buy a bunch of fancy shit that nobody needs you know like you're still the
[00:51:46] guy you're still the guy on on the couch or on the floor going I got to make this work I'm going
[00:51:52] to make this work I'm going to work as hard as I can and and you have that mentality that is an
[00:51:57] amazing thing it's a gift yeah I have a lot of people that depend on me I mean I look at you know
[00:52:04] the the brokers the agents that work on my team not as how much money can they make me but like how
[00:52:11] much money can I make of them you know that I want to feed them as much you know give them as many
[00:52:17] tools feed them as much business help them become successful or else number one they're just going to
[00:52:22] leave me and number two it's it's just not who I am like I'm here to make them the best versions
[00:52:30] of themselves I love coaching I want to help them if I help them be great it's just going to come
[00:52:36] back to me I have my kids I have my wife I have you know this whole this whole community that of
[00:52:44] of clients that are depending on me to not take my foot off the gas yeah now I have fun I like to go
[00:52:52] on vacations I like to ski I like to sit out at a beach but I'm the guy who's on the beach still
[00:52:57] looking on my phone answering emails I'm the guy in the chairlift who's still looking on my phone
[00:53:02] and answering the else not and and it's not like oh god I've got to do this now you want to but
[00:53:07] it's like it's like if I don't do this then mr and mr smith aren't going to be able to like
[00:53:14] move to florida and that's like important for me you know I feel responsible for them and so it's
[00:53:21] that emotional connection I could do a deal and get paid a massive fee but if my clients aren't happy
[00:53:27] it doesn't mean anything to me it's like I'm happy that I get to pay my rent and and and help my
[00:53:33] kids go to camp or whatever of course that's a necessity but um but it's it doesn't feel
[00:53:41] as good if the person that I'm helping doesn't it doesn't smile at the end and know that we went
[00:53:46] through something important together and uh not that I need the appreciation at all I just want
[00:53:52] them happy you know yeah well well getting the appreciation is just validation that you met
[00:53:57] someone else's needs and you took care of them in the and that's your responsibility and you
[00:54:01] take that very seriously and you also get to have fun on the side uh meeting you know all your
[00:54:07] all your marketing and and you know your branding efforts your personal stuff that you do with
[00:54:12] your family um we had the best time yesterday I was in dumbo with my social media manager and we
[00:54:18] were touring this penthouse that is just the most spectacular views um just unbelievable views
[00:54:26] absolutely this this beautiful penthouse and then we were walking around dumbo it was a beautiful day
[00:54:33] and my social media manager was asking me questions kind of like this how did I get involved in
[00:54:37] wheel estate what advice do I have to buyers and sellers and you know what not and and then I'm like
[00:54:42] let's let's go to the Brooklyn ice cream factory and get some ice cream you've got to get this
[00:54:46] place is a great business I love highlighting local businesses all around New York and so she's
[00:54:51] then asking me questions is I'm then lying getting ice cream and then we're walking around and I'm
[00:54:55] answering questions walking on the Brooklyn ice promenade with the entire man hot in the back
[00:55:00] yeah not a bad place to be it was just it was it was like this perfect moment where what a new
[00:55:07] York moment I'm so lucky thank god that I was able I'm able to do something that I enjoy
[00:55:13] that I'm able to help people and then I'm able to you know make a difference in some people's
[00:55:18] lives at a intense time yeah I have one last question for you because we we we of course know
[00:55:24] that everybody struggles everyone has challenges everybody makes mistakes as well and it's for
[00:55:30] the first four years to be doing this show I never asked this question because it didn't occur to
[00:55:34] me and then I realized oh sometimes it's good to to identify you know where people struggle right
[00:55:39] and and even somebody like you who's have this amazing success that you've that you've created that
[00:55:46] you are responsible for and you get all that all of that credit I am curious what is a mistake that
[00:55:51] either you made earlier in your career maybe you're making it now or or something that just isn't
[00:55:56] yet perfect just so that our audience knows Randy's a real guy and still struggles like 100 percent
[00:56:01] I struggle all the time like I I was never diagnosed with ADHD because they did not do that in my
[00:56:08] day they just told me I was a dreamer Randy Randy you're always free you can't pay attention yeah you
[00:56:14] can't pay attention you can't focus so you know mistakes would come if I am just kind of all over
[00:56:21] the place right when I'm it's hard for me to focus on a task for more than a certain period of time
[00:56:27] before my attention goes to all these other places and so that's that's something that I've struggled
[00:56:33] with that I continue to struggle with literally every single day and so one way to kind of
[00:56:39] ameliorate that that defector that whatever in my personality my difficulty in kind of that
[00:56:48] hyper if I'm into something you hyper focus yeah I hyper focus like if it's doing a bunch of
[00:56:54] paperwork or writing a listing description it's really hard for me so I found amazingly talented
[00:57:00] people today to delegate some of these responsibilities to I think a lot of real estate agents they want
[00:57:08] to do everything themselves sure some things I'm better at than others some things I'm worse at than
[00:57:13] others I'm not good at the paperwork the admin tasks I'll procrastinate on a lot of that stuff
[00:57:22] I'm very detailed oriented so if it's in real we're talking about applications or board packages
[00:57:28] when I have to do it all myself I'd hyper focus on it but then you know it's hard for me now so
[00:57:33] I'm able to say you know what Randy you've got to give up some of this control you've got to let
[00:57:38] other people who love that kind of stuff do that kind of stuff and it's hard to find great people
[00:57:45] and plus with real estate agents again I feel like a lot of real estate agents look they don't look
[00:57:51] at the big picture they look at each different commission check and feel like they need to get
[00:57:56] all of the money right they need to get as much of that commission check as possible but in but real
[00:58:02] estate I've found we have a pretty good margin like the money that I put into my marketing is
[00:58:10] not 30% of what I'm getting at that commission and when I was working for Broadway producers
[00:58:16] they 30% of their budget is like getting butts in seats yeah sure so I feel like you know
[00:58:25] I invest a lot more in my business that I think a lot of other brokers invest in their business
[00:58:31] simply because I'm looking at my business like a business yeah and I'm trying to always come
[00:58:36] at things from a perspective of abundance rather than a perspective of scarcity that you know what
[00:58:43] I have deals right now in the pipeline I have listings right now on the market and I have certain things
[00:58:48] in contract but but that only takes me down a certain amount of months right I don't know what the
[00:58:58] new listings am I going to list in in October I don't know right I have listings coming on the
[00:59:03] market through the spring a couple things maybe in the summer but beyond that I don't know but guess
[00:59:07] what I've been doing this a while now and I've learned that you know what it will come put yourself
[00:59:14] out there talk to people the member of your community give back and it will come come from a
[00:59:21] place of abundance and so you know I don't know how I got there from my inability to focus but it
[00:59:27] was you know hiring people you know agents need to hire an assistant get an assistant you're going
[00:59:33] to be able to do more of what you're great at if you can hire an assistant to pick up the things
[00:59:38] that you're not great at don't do everything yourself because you're going to make more mistakes
[00:59:42] and you're going to not have as much fun and you know don't don't look at things from scarcity you
[00:59:50] know if you've been in a business for a while trust lean into your community trust the people that
[00:59:56] you've helped over the course of your career if you're new in the business okay don't blow all
[01:00:02] of your first commission on marketing take a third of it put it in your savings account take a third of
[01:00:08] it put it in an account just to run your business take a third of it and put it towards taxes right
[01:00:15] if you can just divide your checks into thirds like that you'll all you'll start building your savings
[01:00:21] you're still building your tax savings and you'll always know that you know what this account
[01:00:26] is to run my business and I'm going to use it to run my business I'm not just going to go out and
[01:00:32] buy crazy stuff or go out to fancy dinners or whatever but go step by step by step and hire great
[01:00:40] people to pick up those tasks that you are not great at and it will just your business will flourish I
[01:00:48] perfectly said in a great place to wrap up I want everyone who's listening to if you have any

I know you're a really a TikTok agent, but somebody who's doing well on TikTok. We've done 500 some episodes. This is a really fun one for us. But before we get to today, let's go all the way back to the beginning. I'd love to hear about why you got into real estate, how you got into real estate, what that process was like for you. Amazing. Thanks again for having me. I'm excited to be here. I got my real estate license in August of 2000. That's almost 23 years ago. I cannot believe it. Moved to New York in 1996 after receiving my Master's of Fine Art degree from Carnegie Mellon in the Moscow Art Theatre School in acting. I came to New York and I'm getting these dailies from these messages. Let me turn that back. What was the intention to be an actor? That was the pattern. Yeah, the intention was to be an actor, but I immediately started directing plays. I adopted this play from this Russian novella about a stray dog who gets turned into a man by this mad scientist and runs around the city killing cats. That play won a number of awards. At the time, I was working for different Broadway producers who encouraged me to get rid of my admin job, helping them do their creative endeavors and working on their shows and just to pursue my own dreams. For my day job, I went and got my real estate license. There were a couple other actors that I had worked with and directed in plays who just got their real estate license. I got my real estate license. This was in 2000. I think I was 29, almost 30 years old. I started working with a friend who was an actress who was one of the creators of this musical called the 25th Annual Putnam County Spelling Bee, which is ran on Broadway once. Oh, yeah. That was a big one. I produced all over and I had a theater company with her and a couple other people who created that show, including this guy Dan Fogler, who's an actor. He's on all the fantastic beasts and where they come from movies. He played Francis Ford Coppola and the offer. It was recently on Paramount Plus. He's an amazing guy and great actor. We have this theater company. When I wasn't directing plays, I was teaching. I was also walking dogs. I was also doing coaching, proctors, and I was running around all over New York City, renting the least expensive apartments that you could actually ever find. From down in the East Village and the Lower East Side, all the way up to 214th Street in Harlem. I directed a lot of plays between 2000 and I would say 2008. I probably directed 30 shows. I worked with actors like Jessica Chastain and her final show at Juilliard. She was in the same class as Michael Yurrie, who's now on show on HBO. They worked together and I directed them and their final show at Juilliard. Directed Jeremy Strong, who's one of the lead actors in succession in his first professional play in New York, as well as a couple other shows. Some other amazing actors who've gone on to win Tony's, Emmys, and Oscars. That was what I was doing while I was renting these tiny little apartments. Eventually, I didn't have to walk the dogs or teach in elementary schools. I was only directing and then when I finished a show, I'd go back to real estate and make a bunch of money doing that. It was really fun. It was a great lifestyle. I got to set my own hours. I enjoyed exploring the city and finding my way into a lot of these incredible apartments. And sorry about that. I'm going to turn my... Are you still there? I'm here. Okay. Sorry for these technical difficulties here. I'm a real estate agent, not the greatest computer guy. So let me just as we... As we're paused here, I'm just going to turn this off. Yeah, we're really lucky. So my office here in our office here, the company office, is actually just down the street from the Steppenwolf Theater here in Chicago. So we're very, very fortunate to be that close to the greatness of Steppenwolf. And my coworker who acts as if it's behind me is a big step in Wolf guy. And so he goes to see a lot of... We both go to see quite a few productions. Oh, that's amazing. I love the Steppenwolf company. I follow them. I've never been to Chicago, but definitely all the incredible actors who've come out of there. And so just to get back on track, so I was directing plays and I was doing real estate. And after a while, I took a little break from directing shows and tried to save up a bunch of money. And went full, full, full into real estate. Didn't really do anything else. I spent like six months just trying to save up as much as I can. And I was renting... I rented about a hundred apartments that year. And... By the way, can I pause you for a second? Because New York City rentals are very different from most other cities where... And I don't know that this was the case in all of 100 rentals, but I'm sure it was at least some of them. Whereas in most cities, the landlords or the management companies or the owners of the property paid commissions, but in New York, it's not uncommon that the tenant actually pays the REALTOR commission. Was that the case for a certain percentage of your... By the way, that just seems like a difficult... That's a difficult thing to ask for, at least for all of us that don't ever have to ask that question of our renters. So my hat's off to you, because that is a tough one. Yeah, so in New York City, the tenants always paid the commission at that time. I worked with about 10 landlords that between them owned about 2,000 buildings. And we didn't co-broke at all. We only did... We only worked with ourselves. And so the landlords didn't want us to co-broke and they were... They didn't ever want to pay the fee, so we only charged the tenants the fee. So I would show... We had about 350 units at that time. Can you hear these dings? No, no. We can't hear them. So you're good. Oh, you can't hear them. So it's just a tough thing. No, no, you're totally good. You're a busy writer. You get lots of dings. That's what happens. In my wife at this point. So I had about 350 vacancies at any given time. And I would... If someone didn't like apartment number one, I'd have two, three, four, and five to show them. Then eventually I'd... One of them they would love. I would take them to the bank. This is what we used to be able to do in these days. We kept doing this and we don't do this today. But I'd take them to the bank and have them fill out an application. I would take a deposit. I would write them a receipt and I would take the apartment off the market for them and the apartment would basically be theirs. And then I would take them to a like a cookie place and get them some cookies. I did that for about eight years, renting a between 120 to 150 apartments a year. And it was like 12 hours a day, seven days a week waking up and pounding the pavement. I never went into the office except when I needed to hand in commission checks. And it was it was really fun. I remember those days as just a great time. I still stayed connected to all of my theater and entertainment folks and started then helping them find apartments to rent and eventually to buy. And it was nice because I was able to make a living to pay my rent to not stress out about where the next utilities bill is going to come from. I started out crashing on a friend's house on a friend's couch in Hoboken, New Jersey after I broke up with my girlfriend in downtown New York and didn't have a place to live. So I was all my stuff was in a Manhattan mini storage and I would commute into the city. I would go to the Manhattan mini storage. I would get in my dog walking attire. I'd walk the dogs and I'd go back into my real estate showing attire and I'd show apartments all over the city. And eventually I saved enough money to get my own apartment. I was sleeping on the floor in a sleeping bag until I rented enough apartments to get a bed. Then I got a bed. That was like a huge improvement. And I just really like was tired of the ups and downs of a theater career. It's a very much a feast and for famine type of career. And just hyper focused when I was working on a play. It was my life. I couldn't think of anything else like that I was supposed to do when I was working on a show. But then the show would be over and I would come back to reality and think, oh my god, like, how am I going to pay my rent now? And I would be freaking out and have to run out and rent a bunch of apartments really fast. So that lifestyle wasn't really great for my anxiety levels. Sure enough. The crazy world of real estate is fine for my anxiety levels. Ah, oddly enough, you found the one with the one industry that's more stressful than real estate. Yeah. Yeah, exactly. But the thing with real estate is I feel like you get as much out of it as you put into it. With theater and stuff, you could put a million things into it. And there's so many things outside of your competence level or outside of your talent level that have that play into it. With real estate, you know, I've found I'm a people person. I've always been a people person. I love working with people, helping people. I love the city. I like transact and I like negotiating. And I'm able to bring a creativity to it. So I'm still able to bring that part of myself to my job. And so I've just found like if I take that exact same work ethic of being able to pour myself into my work and enjoy it, that I'm able to kind of reap a reward. You know, the more people you help, the more people you're able to have a positive impact in, words, spreads, and business kind of comes back to you. So yeah. So eventually after about eight years, I met my wife. And I decided that, you know, with her encouragement that let's branch out and really focus on sales. You know, where I wouldn't have to work 12-hour days, seven days a week, pounding the pavement. I still do work 12 hours, days, seven days a week, but I'm not like pounding the streets of New York's show on apartments for 12 hours a day. A lot of my work is on my phone. A lot of my work is from the office. I do open houses every Sunday. My team, we do get rentals. I'll work on Saturdays as well. But it's a different lifestyle. It's a more predictable lifestyle. It's a more manageable lifestyle. Then, you know, when I was renting apartments, these were $800 a month studios, $1,000 a month, one bedrooms, $1200 a month, two bedrooms, and $1500 a month, three bedrooms. So I went and I just went to the bank to get like a new credit card. And I hadn't like on my personal card to have a business account and different accounts or whatever. But on my personal account, I haven't gotten like a new credit card since I built up my credit. I didn't even have credit when I was like, canton, New York, I had a 570 credit score. And I had to get a secured credit card. And I put my income down as 50,000 a year. So she comes down and she's like, so what's your income level today? And she shows me what it was when I first got the card. And I'm like, wow, you know, $50,000 a year. It was just like that was a whole different life time ago. And it was humbling. And I still see myself as that same exact guy. But now we're selling, you know, $10, $20, $30 million properties as well as properties into $300,000 because we were, I still kept that low, low budget level business and just expanded to a much higher level business as well. But I, we do it all on my team. We feel like we want to help every, like our mantras, we want to get every New Yorker a great place to live. No matter their budget, no matter, you know, we really do specialize in Brooklyn and Manhattan. So when I get people looking for in other boroughs, that Nile under Queens or something like that, I have an amazing referral network that I refer them to if we can't help them. So, um, so yeah, so that's like my trajectory. So started off in 2000, renting these crazy apartments from the East Village up to Harlem. And then in 2008 to 2010 is when things started getting more into the sales. And, and I came over to Corcoran in 2011. Wow. That's, yeah. It's quite a story. It's, I love it because you basically grinded it out and you started, you started with, with a very difficult task again, convincing renters to pay you a commission to, you know, because you had access to these properties. Is, is not an easy thing that most REALTORS ever have to ask for unless they work in New York and Boston, I think, is a little bit that way. And there's a few other cities that were, it's like, it's rare. It is rare. Yeah, New York is so different. I mean, yeah, the tenants pay the commissions when the property sells itself. A lot of times, especially during the pandemic, you know, we didn't want properties to sit around. And so the landlords would pay a commission for a small period of time. But usually if the landlord pays the commission here in New York, there's something wrong with the property. Right. There's a reason. There's a reason. And I mean, I just rented in a townhouse that I put on the market and I had it on the market for about a week. We did one showing and the first person to look at it took it, $17,000 a month and they paid the full commission. Unbelievable. Yeah. And that was like one day's worth of showings. So it's, it can get very expensive. And it just depends on the price point and, and what the particular tenant can afford. If, sure, we do also list, you know, much lower priced properties. I own some investment properties in a building up on 138th Street. And it's a different, it's a different economic level of, renter. And those, those renters, sometimes we do still offer, you know, no fee because someone who's renting a $17,000 a month apartment can afford to pay a fee. Someone who's renting a $15,000 a $2,000 a month apartment, they're in a different financial situation. And so, you know, we, we, if you can, and then also I rented something recently and I don't want to just promote myself as a rental agent. We do everything. We do sales. But we rented something in Waverly Place where, you know, a lot of companies will move their employees to New York City and cover the entire moving cost. And that's what happened in that particular situation. Yeah. But it's a different, different, a different experience, the, the rental game in New York. And then to transition from that, which I know a lot of agents get stuck in the rental game because it's, yeah, it's so continuous. I was stuck in it. And I'll say that for those eight years because you get paid immediately. You get paid when the lease sign is signed. And here in New York, we want leases signed within 24 hours of acceptance. So if someone, if I show someone a rental property, they want it. I send them a link within 24 hours. They're going to apply if it's a condo or a townhouse, the owner's going to approve them, usually within 24 hours. Then we want leases signed within 24 hours of that. And at that point, they're going to submit their rent security deposit and broker's fee with sales. You're getting paid, you know, 90 days from a contract signing. So if you're lucky, you'll sell something within the first three months. And then you have three more months for the deal to close to get paid. Now the market, there's not any one. It's hard to say the market here in New York City because each different neighborhood is its own sub market. So I listed a home for sale in Brooklyn Heights. And I like I said, I work all over Brooklyn in Manhattan. Brooklyn is very, very hot. And it's been hot for a while. I listed a home for $3.85 million. I did one open house. We had 30 people there. We had five offers. Every offer was all cash. The property went into contract a few days later for $4.2 million. And we closed two weeks later. Basically, we did one open house for that property. And sold for 10% above the asking price. And the whole thing lasted from like mid-January to mid-February. And then it was like pretty much finished. But that's a condo. It's a spru-teak building. The owner of the property knew the board. They encouraged them to move quickly. Management companies sometimes could take about seven days to process an application. They may have some questions back and forth. And that was a very, very quick sale transaction. They're not always that way because you're dealing with boards. Yeah. And co-op boards in particular in New York are challenging because oftentimes there's an interview process where even though everything looks good, you still got to win over the board and make sure you don't say your dog has to win over the board. Sometimes we've been in situations where co-ops accept pets on a case-by-case basis. And they actually want the dog to come in there and see how friendly the dog is. So you've got to coach your pet on the board interview as well. The pets being interviewed. I love it. Yeah. Yeah. It was funny. My sister had a, well, I can tell it story later. But my sister had a condo in the West Village. And she's, she had to go in front of the board. I mean, everything went fine. But it was, she was like, it's a weird experience. And it is. It's a funny experience. Usually if you get a board interview, you're pretty much in any way. Because if they, if you weren't in, they wouldn't even give you an interview. It's, it's very rare. I don't think it's ever even happened where I've gotten a buyer on the buyer side into a board interview and something happened and they didn't get it. Usually, you know, we have a list of, you know, top tips, tips for winning a board interview that we provide to every client. And it's very much like, you know, be yourself. Don't question the board. Just be there for their questions. You know, don't offer too much information outside of the questions. They ask you and don't look at it in any sort of like negative way. It's really like, we want to meet who our neighbor is going to be. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. Don't be the person that they go, Oh, God, that person's going to be a problem. Yeah. Don't, don't just talk about all of the work that you're ready to do on your apartment the minute you close. Because who knows that board member that you're sitting across the table from might be your downstairs neighbor, right? You know, just be like, Oh, the place is great. We might do a couple little things here and there. The board knows if you're buying a, in a state sale level property that, that the person's going to want to do work. Or if you're buying a turnkey, print, you know, pristine apartment, don't talk about how you're going to rip up the floors and put in new floors. You know, just keep it simple, keep it brief, get through it, close, and then, you know, do your thing. Well, you are not only started out as a successful leasing agent in New York and then transition to not just being working with buyers and sellers, but working really in the sort of upper levels of luxury properties. But I really don't want to talk as much about that only because you're also doing something that I have not yet found from one of our guests yet, which I'm really excited to talk about, which is I really want to talk about marketing specifically. I want to hear, I want to hear about your social media success because, and I just want to reiterate what we, but actually I didn't say this earlier. So Rania's is an incredible social media following. By the way, he's not somebody in his early 20s doing this, right, where you would expect the kind of numbers I'm about to share with you to be somebody who is, who is just skewing younger, but Rania's actually having the success as, as, you know, a man in his 40s, you know, and so I'm sorry, 50s, my apologies. I was, I was, I was, yeah, even more impressive. And he has 20,000 Instagram followers, but here's the really amazing, amazing 300,000 followers on TikTok. So I would love to talk to you about what the role of social media is in your marketing strategy, how it works, and how you think it became so, so effective for you. Yeah, I love talking about this because this is where I can really bring in my creativity because I'm a storyteller. And as we said earlier, you know, I started in the world of theater. I've had the good fortune of being an amazingly fertile group of creative artists in the early mid 90s here in New York City, actors who've gone on to win Academy Awards, Emmy Awards, Tony Awards, writers who've won Emmy Awards, nominated for Academy Awards. And I bring a lot of this creativity into my marketing. And so, you know, what we found is creating fun, engaging marketing pieces through video that connect on an emotional level, creates a very meaningful connection between myself and potential clients or just audience members. And, and it's really been effective and it's spread. You know, I always feel like if you build it, they will come. And so we've just put, you know, we've leaned into social media as a way of being able to be authentic and show my authentic self to the widest variety of people as possible. So in yeah. No, go ahead, go ahead. Yeah. So in January 2021, when we were, when we were quarantined during the pandemic, my wife and I started watching this show Emily and Terris, which I don't know if you're familiar. And in January of 2021, I called my assistant. I said, we need our own Emily and Terris. I, I don't know how to do all of this TikTok stuff, you know, Instagram. I'm just putting videos of me and my kids YouTube. I'd make these videos that were great like short films and I still do a lot of that. You know, I have some videos going on my YouTube channel at Randy Baruch. And one of my first very creative videos is Meet the Randy Baruch team, which is a comedy. It's, it's like if the office met million dollar listing with kids. And so I used my son who's like the, in an Alex P. Keaton, sorry, for his old fogey fan. Oh, I know, I know. Yeah. Of course. But, you know, it's very much done like an episode of the office where we're all talking to the camera and then the handheld is showing us at our jobs. And then it's like, and this new agent is really doing great. And it's like goes to like max and he's on the phone and he's like, listen, you want the deal or not? And it's really, really funny. And that's like a great intro to me and my team and our sets of, sense of humor and how much I love the job and stuff like that. And these YouTube videos really started taking a life of their own. And I, I did this one that looks like a Century 21 commercial from like the late 70s that's in crackling kind of video. And I have this incredible video production company called the real estate production network that I use. And they really do like, like the production levels of my videos are very much like a short film. I did one. I had a 10 million dollar townhouse and I hired a Broadway choreographer, who I know from when I used to direct the Williamson Theater Festival. And I said, I want to do a musical. And so I hired her. She got a body double. And I always like to reference old movies from the 80s and 90s. So this one was like across between American beauty where you get that scene where a net vending is cleaning the house before an open house. And she's like, yeah, yeah, yeah, this house. And she's actually, she's in her suit and she's cleaning everything. Yeah, yeah. It's across between that and the beginning of adventures in babysitting when a little bit shoe is dancing through her room getting dressed for a show. So it's basically need dancing through this 10 million dollar house cleaning the windows, fluffing the pillows, getting it ready. And tap dancing and cartwheeling. And it's amazing. The video is phenomenal. It's won some awards. It's a really was a labor of love. And it's it's joy. It's just exuding joy, joyfulness and spreading joyfulness. And it's it's a wonderful video. And I encourage people to check it out. It's called on your on my toes at 311 less Broadway. We will we will post a link to that in the show notes as well. So everyone can watch this because I need to see this. That's something. Yeah. So back in 2021, I call my assistant like we need an Emily in Paris. We hired this woman really, really cool lady. And she was like 21 years old. She's like, you got to do TikTok. I'm like great. So because I've been in the business for so long and I'm fortunate enough to have created really trusting good relationships with agents all over New York City and all price ranges. And Corcoran Sunshine is one of the biggest marketing marketers of new developments in the city. I was able to get access to a 50 million dollar apartment. So 2021 TikTok was still pretty new coming off of the pandemic, especially to people in my age range. And especially in real estate, there wasn't a lot of other people doing this. And I came up with this idea. I can like almost like lifestyles of the rich and famous from the 80s just to open a window into a different world that a lot of people don't get to see on their every day. Yeah, totally. So I called them up, they gave me access. They allowed me to shoot some video. I said, hey, and the video just starts with me saying, hey, you want to see what a 50 million dollar New York City apartment looks like? Let's go. And by the way, who doesn't want to see what the inside of a 50 million dollar apartment looks like? Everybody wants to see that. Yeah, everyone wants to see that. So we put it to some really crazy hip-hop music that the 20-year-olds like. And I'm a hip-hop fan as well. But it's like that video overnight went viral. Now since then, it's had over 5 million views. And within a week, I had about 90,000 followers. That was my first TikTok video ever. It just went crazy. Then we just expanded it. Like she knew what things to highlight, what things not to highlight. She ended up leaving me and going full time to a social media company. And then I got another social media manager. And we did a video on an off-market 25 million dollar property. That video went viral. It's so far has had 17 million views on TikTok. That went crazy. That then someone memes are asking me if I can post that on their Instagram channel. I said, yes. And overnight, I went from 5,000 Instagram followers to 20,000 Instagram followers from that memes are one. So I'll tell you how crazy it is. I was just in London. My wife's English just like last weekend. We just got back on Sunday, just last Sunday from London. We went there to for a friend's birthday. I'm at this dinner on Friday night. There was about 30 of us at the dinner. And my friends, my wife's best friends, nephew and niece were sitting next to me. He's maybe 16. I think he's 17. And the niece was 18 years old. And they're like, oh, what are you doing in New York? And I'm like, well, I work in real estate. And we were just like chit chatting. And it came up, you know, I wanted to impress them because it's like 18-year-old and 17 years old. I was like, sure. I'm a TikTok channel. And they're like, oh, do you? You've got a TikTok channel. Do you? Very nice. And I'm like, actually, I have about 300,000 followers. I'm like, wow, really? I'm like, I told them, you know, I do all these crazy real estate videos. So like, let me look you up. They looked me up. And they both follow me. They're like, oh, my God, we follow you. Look, and they showed me the video of the $40, $50 million property and the $25 million property. And literally these two teenagers in London that I had just met at this dinner are our followers of mine on TikTok. Amazing. And then after that dinner, we went to another friend of my wife's house and we're chit chatting. And I'm telling his 14-year-old son, this 14-year-old daughter and 16-year-old son, the same story. Like, how crazy is it? Like, I'm big with the teenagers in London. And literally the son, the older one, the 16-year-old also follows me. Amazing. Isn't that funny? So just the reach of TikTok is absolutely amazing. And I'll tell you, it's great because it drives traffic to my Instagram channel. It allows TikToks fun because I get to be a little bit more irreverent and a little bit sillier because it skews like 16 to 24-year-old. Yeah, lower stakes there, yeah, for sure. But the sellers, they love it when I'm pitching a listing. I am very adept at reaching wide audiences. I was in New York magazine in October of 2022 as a real estate influencer. It's brought me to people like yourself where I've been able to do podcasts and spread my message of how much I love to help people in their real estate journeys. And I really see no downside to it. People ask me if you've gotten business from TikTok or gotten business from Instagram. Where I can say yes because I have real estate agents who follow me on these various social media channels on YouTube, TikTok, and Instagram who've given me referrals. I just am closing one today from someone from Minnesota. I have another one from Silicon Valley, someone that I'm helping. And so yeah, absolutely I've gotten business but I don't necessarily look at Instagram and TikTok as lead generation tools. I use them as marketing tools. And the marketing helps me get more people to follow me, helps me in my lead generation to the individuals here in Mexico. I'm also interested in the community. I'm also interested in the community. I'm also I think there's a lot going on there. I think number one of course your background and as a creative is gets put to use in a fun way that really allows you to talk up to really put these productions on and put them on social media with you know you get to write the scripts, you get to direct, you get to choreograph, you get to really make as a as a director which is what you are and where you get to do that again and cast and do all the sort of it's really you're basically doing a very similar thing but honestly like 17 million views on a video that I created. I mean I don't know what television show I can create and put on a TV channel and get 17 million viewers on it. It's I just came to their understanding and you know I was meeting and and talking with a real estate agent who is on a number of these reality shows and stuff and you know really like the person and we had a great synergy. Unfortunately I ended up not working out it wasn't the really the right thing the right time and we couldn't really figure out the best deal but I thought to myself you know what would I can create my own stuff I could create my own shows I have through social media there's billions of people out there who are interested in looking at the lifestyles of you know properties in New York City and I have a budget from Corcoran and I have a budget you know I enhanced that out of pocket and I could create these little 30 second to two minute to five minute little vignettes that are entertaining and you know I love entertaining people I love making them smile I love you know being on camera and being in front of people that's just part of my personality I'm slightly I'm like an extrovert introvert in that way but it's really allowed me to do you know enjoy myself and entertain people at the same time spread you know grow my business so yeah I love one thing that you said that even sort of surprised me because I'm so conditioned when I have guests on who talk about social media in particular it's all about how it drives business right and you were like well yes I'm sure it does and but but that's the number one that's not really why I do it it's more about my overall marketing strategy because yes maybe there aren't a lot of you know people who are buying 20 million dollar homes who are looking for their agent on TikTok however somebody in their orbit might might watch this video or they might watch this video they might get get a little chuckle and then because of how successful the videos are you know other outlets are going to pick up on how successful you are being on the social platforms and they're writing about you mentioned you know being in magazine and also winning awards and yeah all of those things it's it's all about we're really what we're talking about is branding and and you're you're getting to do something that I think most REALTORS don't don't allow themselves to do which is to be silly to be fun to be fun I mean you know even if we look at you know the photos that REALTORS use that are oftentimes 15 years old you know they don't even have fun with their photos and yeah it's a very buttoned down kind of kind of world and you're you're doing you know more of who you authentically are and it's certainly not hurting any part of your business either in fact it's helping and your reach is insane and yes and I'm able to share my knowledge so we do I work with a great social media strategist Kim Ripper of Henry Street Media who we discussed and you know she did a deep dive into all of my social media platforms and and we discussed what's working what's not working what we could do more of what we could do less of and so we temper a lot of these fun videos with educational videos where I could talk about things that are really important to buyer sellers renters and investors right now and we're working you know we're going through a very complicated complex interesting exciting time with the economy in real estate and finance and it's important to share you know my expertise my knowledge my take on things in order to help people as well so video is an incredibly effective way to reach people without getting having to get in the same room with them it's really hard like getting into the same room with a lot of people you know but I could I could text them a video of how I do my marketing I could text them a video of how I market a property or text them a video of me talking about you know how to be effective in a multiple bid situation on a buy side or a sell side and now or even or even to talk and apologize for interrupting or even right now again at the time of this taping maybe this will this will be a distant memory but maybe not but talking about hey the banks you know we've had three bank failures in the US right now and there's now discussion about how that may in fact impact rate lending rates and and again I know you know some a lot of the space that you play in loans are as maybe as common although I'm sure they're very they're very common I mean we do a lot of cash deals we do a ton of financing deals of course you know and real estate and this is me coming from a real estate guy that's one thing that I can understand to me stocks I don't have a great understanding of stocks like I don't have a great understanding of things that I can't look at look at and touch when I am looking at a home I can go in it I know that I can rent it I know that I can do a lot of things with this property and so as a matter of fact earlier today we just had an inspection on an investment property that I'm buying in Pennsylvania because I'm feeling like what do I want my money sitting in a bank right now better better to put it in a property where I can get a rents people will always need a place to live rents my and the K one every year to help yeah exactly exactly and so you know there's to me in my experience of 23 years of doing this you know real estate's always been if you understand it if you have a good you know advice from a financial manager from a CPA and a great real estate agent um you know it's always been a very um good way place to put your money and again you could look at it you could fix it up you can add value to it you know there's a ton of things and there's tax benefits to it as well so you know the video stuff is it's one thing to have all the fun which I love doing and again like when I meet someone that's him cold calling someone or prospecting on the phone I'm calling a past client or I'm calling a place in my geographic farm they might not read all my postcards they might not pick up the phone every time I call but if I text in the video that's 30 seconds long they're probably going to look at it but you know what we do all three so I'm sending a postcard with a QR code that links to the video that takes them to my website then I'm taking that same video I'm dividing it up into 30-second snippets you're clipping it out yeah yeah and clipping that out on my social media and then everything then comes back to the property if I'm selling that property so all of that helps the property is SEO which will push it higher in a Google search and so you know we're we do it all we do print we do video we do digital ads we have our website I pick up the phone and call and everything is connected and everything links together so that we're really you know reaching people everywhere where they're looking and where they're seeing and and it's it's a great way for them to get to get to know me because someone you know you call someone up there at work they might not have 10 minutes or even five minutes to like chit chat with you and get to know you on the phone but then when I shoot them a text and I say hey this is Randy from the courtroom group it was such a pleasure chatting with you please give me a ring whenever you're free then they can see my face they can hear my voice it's it's a it's a bit of a different connection and so quick quick question with with the text videos only because our audience would was gonna email me afterwards they say why didn't you ask this are you using like bomb bomb or loom to make those videos are you just doing those natively through your phone or yeah you know I used to use bomb bomb and I still have an account with bomb bomb I don't use bomb bomb as much because I'm able to to do it in other ways so sometimes I'll just direct I'll just send them a text directly um I use mail chimp for my newsletters and there's videos on all my mail chimp I like driving people to my website because I'm able to capture a lot of their information when they go on my website so when I'm sending a postcard we'll use a QR code that links to my website I don't even use business cards anymore I use this um flow code yeah flow code just on my phone and whenever I'm meeting people are the convention or on the street or wherever and they're like do you have a card I'm just like just take a picture of my flow code then my contact information comes up with links to all of my different social media channels and it's much better than always remembering a card I do have one card that I carry around with my flow code on the back too and if someone wants a card then I give them that card I'll put a couple more cards in my wallet as well but um ready I have to say from it's funny your energy is not only infectious but but I'll I'll tell you the the sort of the vibe I'm getting and I don't even like that word but it's it's an embarrassing word that I wish I had a better word for but the the energy that I'm getting from you is you really really enjoy your business and you get to be creative you get to do fun things on social media and and so you get to be entertaining on social media and educational so you get to sort of do both you want to be silly and put together a fun musical you can do that uh short musical or if you want to talk about hey here's here's what's happening in the market right now that you should be aware of or hey want to see what the inside of this fancy place um you get to have a lot of fun but you're also still grinding it out in the business because that's that's the business so it seems like you have a and you have all these marketing channels working for you um you're hitting people in all mediums you're hitting them with with mailers you're hitting them with texts uh video uh social media uh your website and and you're just it seems like you're just having a lot of fun yeah it is it is a lot of fun it's always something different I have an awesome team we have an operations manager we have to uh junior agents we have a marketing assistant who's also going to be a new junior agent we have a social media manager it's really fun dealing with all of these great people who kind of help make the magic happen and and also I just love helping people helping people you know back when I was doing the theater stuff I loved working with actors I enjoyed being a director more than being an actor because being a director you have a you're responsible for a lot of people's success um yeah you're responsible for helping them be the best versions of themselves and and getting their own success right um and taking people in a certain direction um taking the audience on a journey taking the actors and the designers and you know the these these these amazing individuals who put their faith in you on on on a on a journey to a successful place and I see my work in real estate in very much the same way when I'm hired by a seller you know I'm given a task to help them you know realize their dreams you know with the sale of this property or with the purchase of this property there's a lot of pressure on on us as real estate professionals to help the um the process go smoothly my wife's English I just said this to someone yesterday my mantra is like from Queen Elizabeth keep calm and carry on yeah let let let let let let everybody do their thing but I'm a calm calming factor in the situation and and I love negotiating I mean that's that's fun too and and because I I grinded it out so hardcore in my early years I have that grinding mentality I mean if you're trying to make it in New York in anything especially acting directing writing the creative arts you've got to grind it out if you're getting into real estate you know a lot of these real estate shows they make it seem so easy but they make it seem so easy because the the people on these shows have already reached a level in their careers that allowed them to be on the show and make it look easy the behind the scenes is like a little hamster in a wheel like running running running that's like going on inside me like all the time sure and uh and you know it's it's tough it takes work you don't get paid right away in sales and you've got to constantly be looking in in all directions you know every single day come to the office and we're like okay how many people can I call today how many appointments can I make today how many New Yorkers can I help today you know it's not like oh I have a bunch of deals in the in the pipeline or or in contract and now I'm ready to go like buy a bunch of fancy shit that nobody needs you know like you're still the guy you're still the guy on on the couch or on the floor going I got to make this work I'm going to make this work I'm going to work as hard as I can and and you have that mentality that is an amazing thing it's a gift yeah I have a lot of people that depend on me I mean I look at you know the the brokers the agents that work on my team not as how much money can they make me but like how much money can I make of them you know that I want to feed them as much you know give them as many tools feed them as much business help them become successful or else number one they're just going to leave me and number two it's it's just not who I am like I'm here to make them the best versions of themselves I love coaching I want to help them if I help them be great it's just going to come back to me I have my kids I have my wife I have you know this whole this whole community that of of clients that are depending on me to not take my foot off the gas yeah now I have fun I like to go on vacations I like to ski I like to sit out at a beach but I'm the guy who's on the beach still looking on my phone answering emails I'm the guy in the chairlift who's still looking on my phone and answering the else not and and it's not like oh god I've got to do this now you want to but it's like it's like if I don't do this then mr and mr smith aren't going to be able to like move to florida and that's like important for me you know I feel responsible for them and so it's that emotional connection I could do a deal and get paid a massive fee but if my clients aren't happy it doesn't mean anything to me it's like I'm happy that I get to pay my rent and and and help my kids go to camp or whatever of course that's a necessity but um but it's it doesn't feel as good if the person that I'm helping doesn't it doesn't smile at the end and know that we went through something important together and uh not that I need the appreciation at all I just want them happy you know yeah well well getting the appreciation is just validation that you met someone else's needs and you took care of them in the and that's your responsibility and you take that very seriously and you also get to have fun on the side uh meeting you know all your all your marketing and and you know your branding efforts your personal stuff that you do with your family um we had the best time yesterday I was in dumbo with my social media manager and we were touring this penthouse that is just the most spectacular views um just unbelievable views absolutely this this beautiful penthouse and then we were walking around dumbo it was a beautiful day and my social media manager was asking me questions kind of like this how did I get involved in wheel estate what advice do I have to buyers and sellers and you know what not and and then I'm like let's let's go to the Brooklyn ice cream factory and get some ice cream you've got to get this place is a great business I love highlighting local businesses all around New York and so she's then asking me questions is I'm then lying getting ice cream and then we're walking around and I'm answering questions walking on the Brooklyn ice promenade with the entire man hot in the back yeah not a bad place to be it was just it was it was like this perfect moment where what a new York moment I'm so lucky thank god that I was able I'm able to do something that I enjoy that I'm able to help people and then I'm able to you know make a difference in some people's lives at a intense time yeah I have one last question for you because we we we of course know that everybody struggles everyone has challenges everybody makes mistakes as well and it's for the first four years to be doing this show I never asked this question because it didn't occur to me and then I realized oh sometimes it's good to to identify you know where people struggle right and and even somebody like you who's have this amazing success that you've that you've created that you are responsible for and you get all that all of that credit I am curious what is a mistake that either you made earlier in your career maybe you're making it now or or something that just isn't yet perfect just so that our audience knows Randy's a real guy and still struggles like 100 percent I struggle all the time like I I was never diagnosed with ADHD because they did not do that in my day they just told me I was a dreamer Randy Randy you're always free you can't pay attention yeah you can't pay attention you can't focus so you know mistakes would come if I am just kind of all over the place right when I'm it's hard for me to focus on a task for more than a certain period of time before my attention goes to all these other places and so that's that's something that I've struggled with that I continue to struggle with literally every single day and so one way to kind of ameliorate that that defector that whatever in my personality my difficulty in kind of that hyper if I'm into something you hyper focus yeah I hyper focus like if it's doing a bunch of paperwork or writing a listing description it's really hard for me so I found amazingly talented people today to delegate some of these responsibilities to I think a lot of real estate agents they want to do everything themselves sure some things I'm better at than others some things I'm worse at than others I'm not good at the paperwork the admin tasks I'll procrastinate on a lot of that stuff I'm very detailed oriented so if it's in real we're talking about applications or board packages when I have to do it all myself I'd hyper focus on it but then you know it's hard for me now so I'm able to say you know what Randy you've got to give up some of this control you've got to let other people who love that kind of stuff do that kind of stuff and it's hard to find great people and plus with real estate agents again I feel like a lot of real estate agents look they don't look at the big picture they look at each different commission check and feel like they need to get all of the money right they need to get as much of that commission check as possible but in but real estate I've found we have a pretty good margin like the money that I put into my marketing is not 30% of what I'm getting at that commission and when I was working for Broadway producers they 30% of their budget is like getting butts in seats yeah sure so I feel like you know I invest a lot more in my business that I think a lot of other brokers invest in their business simply because I'm looking at my business like a business yeah and I'm trying to always come at things from a perspective of abundance rather than a perspective of scarcity that you know what I have deals right now in the pipeline I have listings right now on the market and I have certain things in contract but but that only takes me down a certain amount of months right I don't know what the new listings am I going to list in in October I don't know right I have listings coming on the market through the spring a couple things maybe in the summer but beyond that I don't know but guess what I've been doing this a while now and I've learned that you know what it will come put yourself out there talk to people the member of your community give back and it will come come from a place of abundance and so you know I don't know how I got there from my inability to focus but it was you know hiring people you know agents need to hire an assistant get an assistant you're going to be able to do more of what you're great at if you can hire an assistant to pick up the things that you're not great at don't do everything yourself because you're going to make more mistakes and you're going to not have as much fun and you know don't don't look at things from scarcity you know if you've been in a business for a while trust lean into your community trust the people that you've helped over the course of your career if you're new in the business okay don't blow all of your first commission on marketing take a third of it put it in your savings account take a third of it put it in an account just to run your business take a third of it and put it towards taxes right if you can just divide your checks into thirds like that you'll all you'll start building your savings you're still building your tax savings and you'll always know that you know what this account is to run my business and I'm going to use it to run my business I'm not just going to go out and buy crazy stuff or go out to fancy dinners or whatever but go step by step by step and hire great people to pick up those tasks that you are not great at and it will just your business will flourish I perfectly said in a great place to wrap up I want everyone
