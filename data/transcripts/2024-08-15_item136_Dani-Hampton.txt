[00:03:54] Let me tell you more about Danny out at just 33 years old Danny Hampton's journey began 11 years ago
[00:04:01] When she bought her first home at the age of 19 amazing inspired by the experience of selling that home
[00:04:07] She dove headfirst into the real estate industry obtaining her license at the young age of 22 in just four years

[00:05:38] Thank you DJ
[00:05:40] Super excited to have you you've done a truly impressive
[00:05:46] amount of work in
[00:05:48] 11 years especially
[00:05:50] starting in your early 20s
[00:05:53] Which I can't imagine how difficult that would be to start working in real estate at that time
[00:05:58] I've talked to other agents who have done it, but every time I talk to somebody
[00:06:01] I'm always like how did you do that? So before we get to that you bought your first home at 19
[00:06:07] And then was that the catalyst to sort of say this is what I want to do for my life or how did that come to be?
[00:06:14] I think that it definitely helped because I was already in kind of like the real estate industry
[00:06:21] I didn't see myself going into like REALTOR
[00:06:24] But I was actually working in apartments
[00:06:26] So when I was a leasing agent at an apartment complex
[00:06:30] I kind of saw like okay well if I'm in my early
[00:06:34] I'm about to go into my 20s where I'm already getting asked like am I going to college?
[00:06:38] What are you you know are you going to be a stay at home mom because I was already married
[00:06:41] I got married at 18
[00:06:44] Probably not going to highly recommend that but I am still married to him. So I guess I should
[00:06:51] But we uh now I feel like we really just had
[00:06:56] Everything happened obviously with a purpose in a plan because I think the
[00:07:01] Best buying that first home even though we made no money on it when we sold it two years later
[00:07:07] um
[00:07:08] Introduced us to the REALTOR who planted the seed in my head that said maybe you should get your real estate license
[00:07:15] Wow and so at 22 you did that and I'm sure all of us are thinking
[00:07:20] Well, what buyer or seller in their right mind is going to choose a 22 year old now
[00:07:25] Obviously, you're not out there probably broadcasting. Hey, I'm 22 and I'm a REALTOR
[00:07:29] But at the same time you are 20 or you were 22 and a REALTOR so
[00:07:34] Getting into leasing prior to that makes a lot of sense
[00:07:37] I think that tends to be a little bit
[00:07:40] I wouldn't say easier but certainly more
[00:07:44] Understandable that somebody at that age could help somebody with leasing
[00:07:46] Obviously not as big of a commitment as buying or selling a home
[00:07:49] But you are now a REALTOR at 22
[00:07:51] So how did you start building your business? Did you go back to any of those people that you helped on the leasing side said hey by the way
[00:07:59] Now we should talk about next steps in buying a home or did you have to start from from scratch?
[00:08:03] Rock is a combination. I think that
[00:08:06] So what one thing I knew I needed to do was that I needed to join a real estate team because I knew that
[00:08:15] You know, obviously where am I going to get my leads and if I'm not sitting in a place that has walk ins
[00:08:20] Then I'm essentially like okay, where would leads come from and then of course just already like dipping my toes into that knowing
[00:08:27] Okay, what's the sphere of influence? Where would I how would I build that and
[00:08:32] Knowing my age in itself would be one of the biggest challenges because
[00:08:37] Most of my sphere of influence either you know if they're the parents of the
[00:08:42] The kids I grew up with
[00:08:45] They're they're gonna need to see me in my career and trust me before they would actually go into a professional setting
[00:08:51] And then the the you know my friend group right like half of them. We're still living at home sure
[00:09:00] And or didn't have the money
[00:09:02] So I I knew that I needed to go to a real estate team that had an established business
[00:09:07] And that in itself is where a lot of my confidence got built up and
[00:09:13] just being able to kind of like
[00:09:16] Soak up that it's almost like you're borrowing confidence right if you're working if in proximity with someone who has already an established business
[00:09:24] I feel like the more I was able to hang out hang around those agents
[00:09:28] I was able to kind of soak up that confidence and be able to deliver that which actually a lot of the times
[00:09:34] Not many people asked my age because they felt like I spoke with enough confidence and experience because I was borrowing that from other people
[00:09:44] Yeah, the borrowing
[00:09:45] borrowing experience or borrowing language or borrowing sort of tips and strategies from
[00:09:52] You know their teammates or the team lead or just sort of soaking up
[00:09:57] You know, this is how people talk in this in this industry again probably does solve a lot of those while I'm only 22
[00:10:04] Because it doesn't come up if you're able to effectively provide value I think so so and I also think too getting married at 18 probably helped accelerate
[00:10:13] Your maturity. I mean I would just have to I would assume because you are now forced to
[00:10:18] Live an interpersonal life with someone and be around them 24-7 most you know 18 to 22 year olds don't have that
[00:10:26] Maybe they have roommates or maybe they're in college but other than that it is it is usually a pretty solo experience
[00:10:32] So I suspect you're probably even your interpersonal skills, you know relating to others and being able to you know
[00:10:39] You were living a real life by the age of 22
[00:10:42] And had been for several years whereas the rest of us are like all right
[00:10:45] We just graduated college. What do we do now now what I do and how do I I have to tell you?
[00:10:50] I think really because it's almost like I need to have a bio to my bio because I
[00:10:57] Left my home at the age of 15 I met my husband at that same time
[00:11:02] um, I quickly had to figure out what I needed to do for work how I was gonna finish school. I got my GED
[00:11:12] um
[00:11:13] There were a lot of things that kind of I feel like did catapult me into a
[00:11:20] Older age and I kind of I had actually kind of feel like I adopt his age a little bit because he's three years older than me
[00:11:26] So um, well, I think there's a lot of just like yes
[00:11:30] I had to grow up a little early and
[00:11:33] So there was a lot of like a people would assume I was older because I was married
[00:11:39] I I did have a little bit more inner confidence because I do have at least the social skills
[00:11:46] the life skills
[00:11:48] To be able to you know get people to
[00:11:52] relate to me and you know like me know me and trust me
[00:11:55] Yeah, well, that's that's what it's all about
[00:11:57] So you joined a team which was I think really wise decision at at that age because again your age is going is working
[00:12:05] You know to some degree against you because again your friend group are you know still living at home or renting or certainly
[00:12:12] Most of them aren't purchasing properties
[00:12:14] And again, you're like how am I gonna actually build this business?
[00:12:17] Let's learn from from people who have come before me and I think
[00:12:21] A lot of agents could benefit even if they're one or two years in the business
[00:12:25] If they're not getting the success they need or they don't feel like something's missing and they can't quite solve it
[00:12:31] That I think joining a team is is not a terrible way to go for a few years and really sort of understanding
[00:12:37] Oh, this is how it's done and then eventually you know you can you can leave if you want to
[00:12:42] But I do think it's an underutilized sort of thing and and I do encourage our listeners if you feel that
[00:12:48] You know you could use a
[00:12:49] A leg up and you're not really getting that one-on-one support or training from your firm and not every brokerage provides that
[00:12:55] That is great idea to you know reach out to a team leader up. What I so
[00:13:01] Let's I want to talk a little bit about you know building a team because
[00:13:05] Not only were you part of a team, but then years later you built a team
[00:13:09] And you are still building a team and you're you know consistently you know constantly
[00:13:14] Defining it and and figuring it out along the way and adding people and then people drop off and then you and I know how that works
[00:13:20] Everybody who runs a team knows knows the how that is
[00:13:24] But how did you go about deciding that you wanted to build one yourself?
[00:13:29] Um, so I I knew that I couldn't do it alone
[00:13:33] So I mean even with I think it helped a lot with me being on a real estate team to see how they operated
[00:13:39] Um, so you know, let's just say I already saw the good bat and ugly of real estate teams
[00:13:44] And then I decided okay, I don't know if I had a big picture of what I wanted to build which I would highly recommend that you start there
[00:13:52] um
[00:13:53] But in the moment because I already had a referral system that was coming into my business and because I was already
[00:14:01] Balancing that parent life
[00:14:03] Um, I knew that I had to have somebody else that could at least answer
[00:14:09] My clients when they have questions um, especially someone who would uh help me with paperwork because you know
[00:14:17] And probably every job now they all give you personality assessments
[00:14:21] But they of course did that in the beginning of my career
[00:14:24] And I don't even think I needed an assessment to tell me I'm not great at paperwork
[00:14:28] Um, I'm definitely not the administrator um, so I I knew that I needed
[00:14:34] Assistant help but when I realized
[00:14:38] That I needed to have other agents on the team back hood. I could leverage my listings and help
[00:14:46] Bring more buyers in and I was seeing how the opportunity could really present itself to where hey
[00:14:53] We build a brand and we can also have weeds come into this brand and
[00:14:58] Basically create that win-win because I'm gonna create all the I'll I'll build all the tools and resources for you
[00:15:07] I just need bodies essentially that came when
[00:15:12] You know be there to service the cut the clients and I knew that was probably where the team started to kind of build because my brand
[00:15:21] Everything I did for marketing. This is what I say. I'll do this is what I did right and then this what I did wrong
[00:15:27] Um, I built my brand. I built everything on the marketing side and then I didn't have like the
[00:15:36] foundation of
[00:15:37] standards and
[00:15:38] expectations and
[00:15:41] Basically what
[00:15:43] Those expectations in itself, I think is probably what needs to be highlighted because
[00:15:48] I didn't necessarily know what to expect of team members because I'm only seeing what I'm pouring in
[00:15:55] And when I realized that we didn't
[00:15:58] Communicate what I expected on the other side. I think that's where people start getting that confusion of what does my team provide and what do I provide?
[00:16:08] Yeah, that that does make a lot of sense this idea of standards is really I think really interesting and I think for those that are listening that are thinking about joining a team
[00:16:17] It is important to talk about that when you're interviewing teams to maybe join or when you're building your own team to really have a well-defined
[00:16:25] Standard of standard of practice and and really having
[00:16:28] Okay, when somebody emails us at 11 o'clock at night like what's our process like do we have to respond to it right away?
[00:16:36] Do we respond to it next morning at 8 a.m.? Like whatever whatever
[00:16:40] You know the team wants to do is is you know fine
[00:16:43] But just knowing that okay, I know for sure that's getting responded to within a certain amount of time or you know
[00:16:49] We when this happens. I do you know someone does this
[00:16:53] And that is really really important because of course you've built this incredible brand for yourself
[00:16:59] And you probably do everything you know a very you know meticulously
[00:17:04] And because it's your name it's your brand it's your business and then bringing on team members
[00:17:08] They don't always share the exact level of perfectionism or sort of you know diligence
[00:17:15] And so I think it is probably really important
[00:17:17] So do you do feel like with your team now you have a better well-defined?
[00:17:21] Here's the expectations for you know what what we're gonna do each time we get a client
[00:17:25] Yeah, there's um there has been definitely a learning process over those last five years of
[00:17:31] Just constantly redefining that and revisiting them um, you know some of those standards
[00:17:36] I feel like you know they tend to change because it's either based off the market conditions
[00:17:43] Right, I had to build certain standards and expectations when we had multiple offers all the time sure and then
[00:17:51] Um, and then when they're gets to a market where it's a little bit slower where people are able to sleep at night and put offers in a couple days later
[00:17:59] I mean, I think that expectations just get changed a little bit um, I would say just as a side note for any REALTORS who are listening that I feel like
[00:18:08] You should have expectations and standards for your clients
[00:18:12] Even if you weren't team building I think that
[00:18:15] being that clarity just helps ease both sides
[00:18:19] Um, but as far as like for team members, I think that having those standards and expectations
[00:18:25] I just feel like you have to kind of remind yourself like why you're in that position
[00:18:32] Um, because I feel like as a team agent
[00:18:35] I don't necessarily know if I ever saw myself leaving real estate teams to build my own team
[00:18:42] Until I stop stop seeing the value of the team
[00:18:46] Yeah, and I think that as a team leader we have to own the position of kind of
[00:18:53] consistently reminding them why they're here
[00:18:57] And why we're a team together because as much as it's you know glorious to
[00:19:02] Have a brand that has your name on it and you did all the hard work to put that logo together and everything um
[00:19:10] There was a point I think in the last year that I had a really good like honest and raw conversation with my team that was like
[00:19:17] You guys are making more money than me
[00:19:20] Like I am spending so much money in everything to try to keep this roof over our heads
[00:19:27] And in all honesty getting the conversation of hey, you know, I'm not happy with splits or I don't feel like I'm getting what I need
[00:19:37] Um, it's kind of it's a hard you know, it's a big pill to swallow as a team leader
[00:19:43] And I know other leaders feel this way because I've networked and masterminded with them
[00:19:47] That it's like hey, you know, we kind of we both kind of have to be
[00:19:52] Reminded why we're doing what we're doing um and those unmet expectations sometimes creep up really fast
[00:20:00] Um because they tend to change
[00:20:04] Yeah, I agreed and I think that having a north star sort of the knowing the wise and reminding
[00:20:13] Like you were saying, you know, it's like writing a mission statement for a business and then
[00:20:17] A year later you're like, didn't we do that a year ago? Do you remember what it was?
[00:20:21] So this idea of writing out standards and sort of why we're doing the things we're doing is great
[00:20:27] But our brains are are pretty fickle. They're not great at remembering things and
[00:20:32] We should have a process where regularly we're communicating with our team or our brokerage
[00:20:37] Here's why I do this. Here's what I need. Here's what I can offer
[00:20:42] You know, those those three things I think are really really important
[00:20:46] It's just like again, I'll just repeat them for anyone listening as you know, what do I what do I need from the team or what can I offer the team and
[00:20:54] And why why am I a REALTOR what am I what and what value are we providing would be the fourth, you know
[00:20:59] Why should someone choose our team right and and getting everybody on that same page
[00:21:05] Can be tricky and because people have different specialties and different personalities
[00:21:09] So I can appreciate that hustle, but I think you're so right
[00:21:12] It's the most important thing is to really understand the value of the people you work the values of the people you work with because if you know their values you can
[00:21:21] Somewhat predict their behavior right and if their values if you don't know them then it becomes more erratic
[00:21:26] So I'm curious when when you look for a team member to join you what do you look for what what this is be great
[00:21:34] Advice for any of our listeners who are thinking about maybe joining the team
[00:21:39] Yeah, so I think that um I think having a similar
[00:21:46] Work ethic definitely is one is a key factor for me because I notice that when I
[00:21:54] Am around someone who is a little bit more slower paced
[00:21:58] Um even if it's not said because maybe they want to you know, maybe they want to
[00:22:05] Be influenced by me by by one of my skills or whatever it might be um I don't think people realize how quickly I move
[00:22:13] And so I work really fast um I talk really fast um I talk about a very loud, you know
[00:22:21] tone um
[00:22:22] So there's a lot of things where I'm like I kind of have to know
[00:22:27] Their ability to work in an atmosphere that might feel a little fast paced because
[00:22:34] I think we kind of have to have a similar almost north star
[00:22:37] On my are you able to grow so um something I've actually put into my
[00:22:44] My values is that I I need someone who values personal growth because I think that I'm consistently working on my own personal development
[00:22:54] And I do expect my team members around me to have that name type of guy
[00:23:00] Yeah, I agree. It's funny. I do a similar thing in my personal romantic relationship which um
[00:23:07] The I'm in a newer relationship and one of the things that that we both have
[00:23:13] agreed upon my partner in a high is that if we both continue to grow ourselves and work on our own
[00:23:20] baggage our own insecurities our own glitches whatever you may want to call them
[00:23:24] That likely the relationship will get stronger as a result of working on an individual effort because a lot of times
[00:23:33] Individual challenges show up in the way we treat others sort of you know unconsciously even we we were upset with ourselves
[00:23:40] We take it out on our partner or you know whatever so for us in in a kind of a different way, but in a similar way
[00:23:47] Um, I'm doing the similar thing is like I my my partner and I we talk about the things we're working on individually
[00:23:54] For our personal growth and it's you know, it sounds kind of silly and but it's but it's really helpful because I'm like oh cool
[00:24:01] She's working on this one thing I can start looking for that and and maybe even give her feedback on how it's going if she wants that
[00:24:07] And then you know, we're just more in sync more communication so I firmly I firmly agree that you know
[00:24:14] Whether it's a team we're doing this in our business too. We are all reading a simple a book right now called a 21
[00:24:21] Immutable laws of of leadership
[00:24:24] Or something like that anyway, and we're all taking chapters and every week we report on our chapter and it's a personal growth kind of thing
[00:24:30] And it helps it it helps so I love that that you know looking for that in in a teammate and also too
[00:24:36] If you work on yourself your business will get better your your relationships look at better your health will get better
[00:24:42] Everything everything improves because you're raising your own standards
[00:24:45] Absolutely, I think it definitely creates some kind of balance it gives you connection
[00:24:51] Um, so and that's something to where I feel like as I
[00:24:55] Honestly becoming a team leader has been the biggest blessing in my life because it really has set this higher level of accountability
[00:25:03] And that higher level of accountability to me um because it's kind of like I guess I guess I also see that as parenting
[00:25:10] When you're now responsible for another being then all sudden you start kind of looking inward going
[00:25:17] Oh, how am I showing up and so then when you start that in business um, I mean, it's a very uncomfortable feeling
[00:25:25] But I was like okay, I have to get up to the office at this time because I need to really lead by example and
[00:25:31] There's been a lot of um
[00:25:34] There's been a lot of instances over those last five to six years uh that I believe
[00:25:39] Truly has you know contributed to my own personal growth and development because
[00:25:44] I have people looking at me and it's not just my kids
[00:25:48] It's it's these grown adults and um and shoot some of them are even older than me
[00:25:55] And it doesn't even matter because you know we there's a reason why we're working together. We want to
[00:26:01] Um, we want to improve some area of our life
[00:26:04] Usually they're coming to me because they want to improve their professional and financial world
[00:26:09] Um, but I think that there's so much more to that. I think that's what brings you in the door
[00:26:15] Um, I think that what's
[00:26:17] Has separated team members before has been the fact of like you know what I'm really not willing to grow at that pace
[00:26:25] And I have probably been on like a 10x journey for the last couple of years
[00:26:31] Because I've done that so much inner work in the last two years
[00:26:36] That I feel like it's now going to the other side in the professional world where
[00:26:43] People are like that's way too much um because I I'm I've figured out a lot of stuff that I'm like
[00:26:50] Oh, okay, I'm gonna show up different. I'm gonna be different
[00:26:53] But I also now have higher standards of the people around me
[00:26:58] And if you're not willing to make those changes to meet those standards then I mean we're all gonna be uncomfortable
[00:27:04] Sure
[00:27:05] Yeah, no, no, I it is absolutely right. I mean it's it sort of reminds me of that expression and it well
[00:27:11] I'll have to ask the audience to take a little bit of a leap with me on this one
[00:27:14] But it really has to do with uh, I always love this. I heard it from Brian Tracy. He used to say
[00:27:20] Prospecting solves all problems and he wasn't necessarily speaking about real estate
[00:27:23] But you know if we think about like why do people leave the industry lack of leads lack of business is probably the reason or or burnout
[00:27:30] I guess maybe but burnout I see very rarely I see a lot of people leaving for for the reason of they aren't burnt out
[00:27:37] Because they didn't have enough business. So prospecting you know does kind of solve all problems related to
[00:27:42] Business as far as staying in business because it will you could be the worst REALTOR in the world
[00:27:47] But if you have leads like you're gonna do okay
[00:27:49] And of course you don't want to be a terrible REALTOR
[00:27:52] But you could be if you just had enough leads and you could probably still exist
[00:27:57] And so this idea of of personal growth is kind of the same thing. It's just like you always
[00:28:02] You know personal growth kind of solves all problems because it'll it'll sort of raise your standards
[00:28:08] It raises your output and it then encourages or leading by examples shows other team members. Here's where we're at now
[00:28:15] And again, not all team members will always make that that transition
[00:28:20] And so certainly you know teams can fluctuate over time as standards change
[00:28:26] So I think that's a really really wise thing. So look for surely set a couple of things
[00:28:30] This look for teams that have well-defined standards of practice have well-defined values have some north stars that they really live by and and remind their teammates about
[00:28:42] And then and then also
[00:28:45] You know what what we were just just mentioning. So I think I think that's a that's some great suggestions for team
[00:28:51] Team either leaders or people looking to join
[00:28:54] I want to talk a little bit about your branding because you did something incredible and I'm sure you you guys have had incredible production since this
[00:29:02] But in 2020 this is particularly interesting that somehow you during the pandemic which you know agents largely weren't working
[00:29:10] Of course as much some states they weren't able to work at all
[00:29:13] But you know you were able to work and your team closed a hundred and seven hundred and forty seven homes that year
[00:29:19] That was a tough year to do that
[00:29:20] So tell us and by the way not just close that many homes almost 150 homes
[00:29:26] You weren't buying leads and you weren't making cold calls. So tell us sort of how you did that because I know social media is a big
[00:29:32] Sort of lead gen source for you, but you have a particular sort of unique approach to it
[00:29:36] So do you mind sharing sort of how you approach social media?
[00:29:39] Sure, so um
[00:29:41] I mean first off
[00:29:42] I did a lot of failing forward with social media in the very beginning so as many people keep good into this mindset of
[00:29:50] I need to look a certain way or sound a certain way
[00:29:54] Yeah, you just got a post, you know, just just post and just keep moving forward
[00:29:59] um, but I I noticed what I did differently was um, I'm really just bringing the human aspect into social media
[00:30:07] And I think that so most of this came from Facebook just a clear anything up because now that we're talking about this in
[00:30:15] 2024
[00:30:16] I was not a tiktokker. I was not highly I was not very active on Instagram. I definitely did more on Facebook
[00:30:24] But it was all about trying to create community and I feel like the
[00:30:30] tips that I give and coach agents on with social media is to do it on an organic level
[00:30:36] Is that first of all um, just the general rule in real estate is you've got to be you've you got to get yourself to be a person that someone can like no interest
[00:30:45] Well now figure out how to be someone you can like no interest on social media and um
[00:30:52] When I when I hear that I feel like I'm looking for someone I can relate to
[00:30:57] And I think that the thing the thing that I knew I needed to separate myself
[00:31:02] So I decided I was not going to be the lexas driving REALTOR
[00:31:06] and um, which is funny because I did buy a lexas when I made my first $100,000
[00:31:13] So um after having two lexas I figured out my true identity and I traded it in for a Jeep
[00:31:21] um, I also started just wearing ball caps and t-shirts and man did I piss off a lot of agents in my area
[00:31:29] um
[00:31:30] And I just knew in that moment I finally found that inner confidence with myself that I was doing real estate for just a handful of years that I felt
[00:31:38] I knew who I was so I wanted to show who I was and um, I just knew my life. I was like, nope
[00:31:45] I just don't want to dress up for appointments. Well, I brought that
[00:31:49] Into my social media world because I wanted people to feel comfortable with reaching out to me and being like, you know what guys this
[00:31:57] This is me. This is how I show up and you know, it really brought down that
[00:32:03] I wouldn't say that they didn't treat me like a professional
[00:32:06] But I feel like that trust factor happened a whole lot quicker
[00:32:11] Because I now kind of almost felt like they're REALTOR friend
[00:32:15] And so I feel like my that sphere of influence that I was building became so much larger because I started to get referred
[00:32:23] To more and more people and the way people were able to reach out to me
[00:32:27] Well, be where they are. That's what I tell a lot of people like just go be where they are
[00:32:32] So even if you're calling leads try to find them on social media because that's probably where they're hanging out
[00:32:40] They don't want to be at work. They're probably scrolling their phones
[00:32:44] And so if you're able to connect with someone when they don't have that
[00:32:50] That big wall up right that the don't talk to me like it's the same one that goes up when I go into a mall and all the people in the middle one
[00:33:00] I try to get me to buy something I have that wall up but when I'm on social media accounts
[00:33:06] I'm usually walled down because I want to connect with people
[00:33:10] So I feel like the biggest you know the biggest thing I did was just being a real person online
[00:33:17] Showing who I was giving enough content that allowed people to connect with me and then just being a social person
[00:33:25] So you got to go talk to a lot of people lots of conversations lots of comments
[00:33:33] Yes, and what I like about the sort of um the attire situation where you're talking about hey, I wear a t-shirt. I wear a ball cap
[00:33:43] I I don't have any judgment upon whether that's appropriate for or not because everyone can make up their own decision of whether that fits with their own personal
[00:33:52] You know sort of dress values
[00:33:54] However, here's what it here's what is is is irrefutable if you're showing up every day on social media with your videos and your your pictures
[00:34:03] And you are wearing a ball cap and
[00:34:07] And you know t-shirt and that's your
[00:34:10] costume so to speak or or your
[00:34:12] Your uniform so to speak
[00:34:15] Well, that's what people would expect when they meet you in person too
[00:34:19] So it's not whether it's a good idea or bad idea for for somebody to decide whatever someone's personal brand
[00:34:26] You know style style brand is like that. I don't think it matters
[00:34:30] I just think choose choose something it doesn't have to be where the same close every day
[00:34:34] But have some sort of style and then if you're providing value it almost doesn't matter much what you're wearing
[00:34:41] But this idea of having a brand and also to I think Danny
[00:34:45] I think you're all you're doing yourself a huge service by dressing down
[00:34:49] And I think that would probably fly in the face of a lot of people's sort of assumption that well
[00:34:55] Maybe she's making it harder because she doesn't maybe dresses professional as other agents
[00:34:59] Well, if we look at the results the results seem to suggest that nobody seemed to care
[00:35:03] That at least in 2020 when he sold almost 150 homes
[00:35:07] So the results speak for themselves, but here's where I think it does actually help you because
[00:35:12] If they can see your results and see that you're a high producing team and my brand is that I dress down
[00:35:19] But it's not like you look you know, you know, you don't look sloppy. You're just wearing you know, uh, you know
[00:35:24] Less um business casual type of yeah and
[00:35:28] In a weird way when I see somebody who's at the top of their game or the top of that sort of industry
[00:35:36] dressing down
[00:35:37] I'm like, oh that person must really know a lot because they're not trying to impress me with their
[00:35:42] And I know that sound silly and I'm sure not everybody would have that reaction
[00:35:45] But these are people who have been following you on social media
[00:35:48] They already know what you dress like they already know how you speak what you're into you
[00:35:52] You're you talked about being authentic and honest
[00:35:55] So you you just show up in your in your regular um, you know uniform and
[00:36:01] Of course he would like why it would probably be more unusual if you showed up in in a really you know, it's a fancy dress
[00:36:08] For example, they probably be like I don't I don't know this Danny. I know the other Danny
[00:36:12] I think I actually got a few of those comments before I might have like shown up after some kind of photo shoot that I did or something
[00:36:18] And I did try to dress up and then people be like who is this
[00:36:21] Um, I and I think just did I really tag on to the being authentic and being honest
[00:36:27] I mean the more I showed up as myself and the more that I actually just talked work
[00:36:33] So there's a lot of real estate agents. I feel like that struggle with talking about real estate online
[00:36:39] And it's either that they don't want to be too salesy. I get the word salesy a lot
[00:36:44] And I'm like if you don't want to be too salesy to the people who follow you
[00:36:47] But I'm like, but that's who you want to hire you
[00:36:50] Um, there's been so many listing appointments that I've walked into that I never had to give a presentation to
[00:36:56] They already hired me before I walked in the door. So to me, I'm like because I've shared what I did
[00:37:04] If I didn't tell like the
[00:37:07] Basically the consumers I want to call me. I'm like I'm constantly advertising and
[00:37:14] Yes, you know, there is the
[00:37:16] That atypical
[00:37:19] Just sold just listed types of posts, but that doesn't prove anything to me
[00:37:25] So I'm like to the news like so this is actually what I
[00:37:30] Didn't know I was doing back in 2020 that I actually now have a strategy for
[00:37:35] But it's just truly just going people just need
[00:37:39] Proof and they also need something to connect with so it's super helpful when you're able to go
[00:37:45] Hey, I just helped someone who totally didn't feel ready to list their house
[00:37:50] We went through multiple stages to get their house ready to list
[00:37:54] We did actually do some improvements to their house. I was able to help with that because I have the resources and the people to help them do those things
[00:38:02] So we can improve their value
[00:38:05] Um, just seeing that type of actual proof
[00:38:09] And seeing where that person ended up
[00:38:12] I feel like is that connector because I
[00:38:15] I have actually a story of just someone who I didn't even know was following me
[00:38:20] That was a sibling of one of my past clients. They've been
[00:38:25] Watching all of my even the talking stories just me just getting online and talking
[00:38:31] I
[00:38:32] Apparently one day said something and both the husband and wife called each other and they said did you see Danny's recent things
[00:38:39] And they called me up and they're like we're ready to move because of one thing I said
[00:38:44] And I'm like you just got it
[00:38:47] It's almost like you just kind of got it over share
[00:38:50] And if you're not proud of what you're sharing then that's where you probably need to fix something
[00:38:54] So it's a value piece
[00:38:56] Yeah
[00:38:58] Boy, it that you know it happens to me on the podcast
[00:39:01] Occasionally a smaller version of that where because podcasting podcast listeners often are very passive
[00:39:08] They're not necessarily you know chatting or writing comments or or you know leaving reviews but
[00:39:14] I always love when someone goes you said this one thing or
[00:39:17] But it's usually not me saying it. It's the guest saying it but I heard this one really great thing from one of your guests and
[00:39:23] And you're right and that's that that it can be
[00:39:26] Just that simple and so when we when you think about content for social media
[00:39:32] What kind of content are you putting out in it when I say that I'm specifically asking
[00:39:38] Personal content, you know private life a personal life content that you're willing to share and business content
[00:39:44] So how do you figure that out?
[00:39:47] So um, I guess I kind of feel like a lot of my audience
[00:39:52] Possibly might relate to the things that I'm into or the things that I do every single day
[00:39:59] And so if I'm just balancing life with uh with my kids their ages nine and five
[00:40:04] So the entertainment levels that I have to bring to these kids
[00:40:09] Um because just so you know they're they hate commercials
[00:40:12] They have just they have let me know this weekend that they cannot watch anything that has commercials because it's just the longest three minutes of their life
[00:40:20] Yeah
[00:40:21] But I think as far as um, I just kind of look at my life and I'm just like what's something that someone can relate to?
[00:40:28] So personally in my life every single day. I'm just like what's something that they can relate to
[00:40:33] and um, how can I share it and so uh, this could go from
[00:40:39] I think of all different levels too. I think of like what's the things that people aren't sharing right like what are
[00:40:47] Challenges in life that maybe someone needs to see that someone like me who people could think is you know
[00:40:54] Doing pretty well in life that I'm struggling with and so um
[00:40:59] So yeah, I tend to have vulnerable moments online
[00:41:03] Um, I tried to hopefully lead it somewhere. It's not just the poor meat post. It's more of a
[00:41:10] Hey, you know what life has challenges and this is what I'm doing about it um
[00:41:17] Like even to the point of I think actually after 2020
[00:41:21] When I sold 147 homes I I didn't do anything for myself care. I had no self-care regimen
[00:41:29] No
[00:41:30] Nothing. I was a workhorse
[00:41:33] Um, I didn't do anything to contribute to my marriage. I didn't do much to contribute to my parent life either
[00:41:40] I was really just in survival mode and um, everything since I have been sharing online of
[00:41:48] figuring out that daily routine that fills my cup up before I fill anybody else's cups up and um
[00:41:55] Definitely with my career now. I feel like there probably is a little less real estate and a little bit more personal life
[00:42:02] But I think that's where like I was sharing before people want to connect with people
[00:42:09] And then if you end up building that trust factor as a person in that person's world um
[00:42:16] Then obviously, you know, I start to sprinkle in the
[00:42:19] You know houses were selling or things that we're doing for clients and then they're like oh and they're in real
[00:42:25] State of course, I'm gonna work with them. Yeah
[00:42:28] Yeah, I love this idea
[00:42:29] You know, you mentioned sort of being so busy that other parts of your life, you know took a hit and
[00:42:37] Who couldn't relate to that? It's happened to all of us at some point
[00:42:41] We over-focus in one part of our life and other parts of our life suffer
[00:42:45] And so you talked about hey, you know, I wasn't really giving my marriage the attention that it needed
[00:42:49] Um, you know, maybe my children as well or or whatever
[00:42:53] You know fill in the blank with personal physical health
[00:42:56] The spiritual health emotional health whatever inter personal relationships friends family whatever it might be financial
[00:43:01] um and
[00:43:03] Everybody can relate to that right?
[00:43:05] Because in fact, I suspect that balance is imperfect and there's no way to ever actually achieve balance
[00:43:10] So ever we're always out of balance and it's I think the trick is it getting in balance the trick is knowing where you're unbalanced and just making slight adjustments
[00:43:18] Along the way to where things are as balanced as they could get
[00:43:21] But again, it requires um some vulnerability to talk about these things that maybe aren't always like hey look at me
[00:43:29] I just sold a million dollar home, you know, we want to share the successes because of course those are
[00:43:34] fun and and we know
[00:43:36] That we're going to get a good response to that but sharing the vulnerability sharing the challenges like hey guys
[00:43:41] I had this really great year
[00:43:42] But it really took a toll. I really wasn't able to give my my my
[00:43:46] primary relationship enough attention and can anyone out there relate to that?
[00:43:51] Well, here's how what I'm doing to fix that
[00:43:53] Everybody can relate to that right?
[00:43:54] Anybody in a relationship knows what it's like when a relationship stops growing and people go through you know
[00:43:59] peaks and valleys
[00:44:00] So like that's a universal experience, right?
[00:44:03] So no matter how busy somebody is at some point in a relationship both people
[00:44:07] You know go through a pies where they're just not as actively working on it or one personism
[00:44:11] So I love the idea of sharing something like that on social media because number one
[00:44:15] It's honest. It's vulnerable and it's something that is universal that we can all relate to we've all had these experiences
[00:44:22] And you know we expect people on social media to be super super heroes really we we only see people's best moments
[00:44:30] Most of the time on social so this idea of being like here's the
[00:44:35] Maybe the less perfect parts of of me that I want to you know
[00:44:39] Showcase and the reality of it is is people actually bind to imperfection versus perfection
[00:44:45] We actually bind to struggle and challenge because we all go through struggle and challenge
[00:44:50] So I love that you're talking about that. I mean let me share I
[00:44:53] I shared at the beginning of last year and this is where I feel like I got almost a whole new community
[00:44:59] starting to follow me because
[00:45:01] I shared that I discovered my ADD and
[00:45:05] Which is funny because I feel like a lot of people who've known me has like you just found that out
[00:45:10] Like we've known this your whole life
[00:45:13] And so I think that
[00:45:16] When I finally shared that I actually just decided to to really find a way to to control it and to understand it and to
[00:45:24] To work with it without going to be assumed upon Adderall or
[00:45:30] One of those really big name drugs and so I knew that I needed to
[00:45:36] Share that just so that way maybe it could be another piece that people could relate on and the
[00:45:41] Response to it was just incredible
[00:45:45] To have other people going you know what I didn't even think about you know
[00:45:50] Maybe the some of the challenges you spoke about maybe aren't the
[00:45:54] First thing to think of when you think of ADD
[00:45:58] But because you listed it now. I'm researching it and so you know
[00:46:02] And that's where social media has really changed over the years because I mean there's a lot of us who probably don't watch the news anymore
[00:46:08] Um, there's a lot of us who is kind of going through
[00:46:14] Other people's life experiences and seeing how that's it beat how they're being influenced and so
[00:46:21] Yeah, I'm just con that's I mean that's what's obviously has contributed to my own personal development and everything is because if I can be a positive influence to others
[00:46:30] Um, then that's what I hope for and I kind of been changing my mindset to being someone who lives in abundance
[00:46:38] So in hopes that
[00:46:40] I attract the right clients
[00:46:43] And the right team members and people into my world because of the positive things I'm doing to be to contribute to my community
[00:46:53] Um, that's kind of been my focus especially over this last year and
[00:46:57] Um, the other piece of it too with because you asked about the social media content
[00:47:04] Yes, I'm sharing vulnerable stuff. I'm sharing, you know, the highs and the lows
[00:47:09] I'm sharing even things that I'm doing it. We're doing in our marriage to strengthen it
[00:47:13] um, we're we're going through a lot of that um
[00:47:18] As far as the real estate side
[00:47:20] I think we need REALTORS to really get
[00:47:23] Get a little bit more creative with
[00:47:26] um
[00:47:27] The situations that we have presented to us almost every single day
[00:47:31] But how to actually market that
[00:47:34] Online for people to understand like
[00:47:38] Uh, there's so much more behind the scenes in real estate
[00:47:41] Um, then the just listed and just sold and I think that the facade of
[00:47:48] Someone only calls me when they're ready to make a move
[00:47:50] I've been recently changing a lot of my content to be like actually
[00:47:55] I just had a listing appointment for someone who wants to move in 2025
[00:48:00] Awesome. I you know what? I love that. I love I love that so much um because people need to hear
[00:48:07] That consumers need to hear this that hey, I know you know
[00:48:11] I'm now talking to somebody who is not going to make a move for another year
[00:48:16] And here's what we're doing right now to get that person ready
[00:48:20] So if you are thinking of doing something in a year or two
[00:48:24] Call me because I can start getting you ready. I can start helping you along the way
[00:48:28] So that you know and again a great opportunity because what a REALTOR's typically do when they reach out to their sphere
[00:48:36] And they talk to them and do their you know pleasantries then it's like hey
[00:48:39] Are you looking thinking about making a move right now? No, I'm good for a few years
[00:48:42] So okay, cool. I'll just stay in touch and they're not necessarily thinking okay
[00:48:46] You have two years to go okay great
[00:48:48] I'm gonna start reaching out to you with some some ideas some tips
[00:48:51] Let's let's get you there so that when you are ready or if an opportunity comes up between now and then
[00:48:57] That you are ready to go in it just in the event where you know, maybe the market shifts dramatically
[00:49:02] Again, this idea of just like
[00:49:04] You know helping people where they're at which is what you said is really really important and um
[00:49:11] And of course we know that you know staying in touch and communication is everything
[00:49:14] So I love that you do that. I think that is is well
[00:49:17] And there were other piece of content. I've put together is so we're you know
[00:49:22] We're a husband and wife team and so um
[00:49:25] I think my husband didn't realize that I was just gonna consistently con him into becoming a REALTOR one day and
[00:49:32] You know, I started with you'll work operations and then slowly now he has been working more and more as an agent
[00:49:40] um
[00:49:41] And he's not necessarily like the person who's going out there and doing all the lead generation
[00:49:45] But he kills it on the listing side
[00:49:48] um
[00:49:49] He just has a more analytical way of looking at things and I'm
[00:49:54] I'm definitely all visual and marketing and creative and he's very like data analytics
[00:50:01] Which honestly with the market we're in right now you need someone who's obsessed with the numbers
[00:50:07] And so I am I've honestly taken a drive on my marketing side to be like, you know what
[00:50:14] First of all, I think we can help probably a lot of couples who are just like us who are trying to make a decision
[00:50:21] I'm the emotional one and he's the logic. Where's the logic? Yeah, and it's so I'm like
[00:50:29] We just had a listing appointment the other day and he ended up taking lead because they were they really were just like
[00:50:36] You know what we want to cut past the BS like we already know why we want to move
[00:50:40] We just want to make sure it's a smart decision
[00:50:42] To list our house right now because the numbers might not be in our favor
[00:50:47] Right and um and I was like so you guys really want like the data the numbers that type of information
[00:50:53] They said yes, and I said all right here's a job. I have just I have just the guy for you
[00:50:58] And and by the way, that's another really important reason why teams can be super effective is different people
[00:51:05] Of course have different buying styles different evaluative styles and knowing your style or your preferred style or what you communicate more
[00:51:13] Most effectively and knowing your husband in this case and all your team members
[00:51:16] You know knowing their styles. This of course
[00:51:20] Is you you don't have to try to be something you're not you can just pass the torch be like great my partner right here
[00:51:27] Happens to be my husband he knows all that stuff so I
[00:51:30] What again?
[00:51:33] Just because I've had a team member on my team who um because I like I said I'm loud and I'm fast
[00:51:39] And not a lot of
[00:51:41] I've had buyers in the past who were not loud and fast and they they needed a personnel
[00:51:46] That was just a little softer and just a little slower and
[00:51:51] um
[00:51:51] It does it just helps and I communicated that a lot with the team to be like sometimes you're gonna get leads that don't necessarily match you
[00:52:00] And unless you're able to have that emotional intelligence to
[00:52:05] Adjust and be and match them
[00:52:07] um, it is always in your best interest to pass that lead to an agent who is probably gonna best service them
[00:52:14] Because what you're doing is you're keeping yourself from other opportunities because you you're in constant adjustment mode
[00:52:22] And I I learned that through this 11 years
[00:52:25] To be like, you know what it's uncomfortable to adjust myself all the time
[00:52:29] I'm rather I rather just go figure out who I best work with and then we'll you know
[00:52:35] We'll just be able to have hopefully a team setting that allows everyone to be helped
[00:52:40] You know, and I too, I use it said something so wise and I want to sort of throw this out there for our audience in case
[00:52:46] They didn't also have this thought
[00:52:48] That if you are a solo agent and most agents are most agents are individual practitioners if you have a particular style of communication
[00:52:57] Maybe it's a more of an emotional interpersonal like I can really, you know, make people feel connected to me or
[00:53:03] You know, and again, it's not an either or but or for example
[00:53:06] I'm better at analytics and I'm better at factual logical sort of information or you know, whatever it might be
[00:53:13] What whatever someone's knowing your own personal style that works well for you is really important because again
[00:53:19] When you is an individual agent if you were to find you know somebody who isn't really going to understand the way you communicate
[00:53:26] And maybe you don't have a husband who's in the business who's who has those those traits
[00:53:31] She should have some other agents that you can refer business to saying hey, I got the perfect person for you
[00:53:36] I'm not the right person in this particular scenario, but my buddy or or my friend or my colleague so and so
[00:53:42] They're going to be a so much of a better fit and and then you maybe even consider teaming up with that person
[00:53:47] You know more officially
[00:53:48] But I think having those go-tos and we all think about go-tos with respect to referrals and other states
[00:53:54] Obviously, we have to have a go-to there
[00:53:56] But having a go-to in your own local market and I don't mean just somebody who works in area you don't work
[00:54:01] Somebody who works a client you don't really do well with because if you're closer ratio for these kind of clients is only 50 percent
[00:54:08] But but this other person has like a 90 percent close ratio
[00:54:11] Well, I would rather take 30 percent of the transaction give it to somebody who's going to close it and save myself the headache of trying to
[00:54:19] Communicate in a style that really isn't me
[00:54:22] Now easier said than done because we don't want to of course give up business
[00:54:25] That's hard. That's not easy to do but Danny will tell you
[00:54:29] I'm speaking for her, but I'm sure she will say one of the smartest things you can do is not work with clients who aren't a good fit
[00:54:36] Because they will sort of just wear you down and and drag you down and it's not even their fault
[00:54:41] necessarily
[00:54:41] It's just not a good match
[00:54:42] So if you had those experiences where you wished you would have you know ended a relationship
[00:54:47] A client relationship maybe before the closing itself
[00:54:52] Yep, I think that I have I mean honestly, I think that 2020 experience right like in that moment
[00:54:57] I felt like people were kind of coming in like floods and
[00:55:02] We realized at that moment we accepted everyone and that's where I've been sharing like how agents really need to have their own standards
[00:55:10] When it comes to clients and the way they work in their own standards for themselves because I think that when you
[00:55:17] If you let a client treat you however, they are going to treat you and it might not be personal
[00:55:23] It's just their personality their style whatever and that's again goes back to that inner work stuff
[00:55:29] Right, I now realize why a lot of people react the way they do why
[00:55:33] Maybe why I react the way I do maybe it was the way I you know, I was raised maybe it was the way they were raised
[00:55:39] Whatever it is the communication style is so big
[00:55:43] And if I have someone who basically calls me and is like I'm gonna always need to talk after 10 p.m. At night
[00:55:49] I know I am not my best self after 10 p.m. At night and I'm probably gonna be highly emotional and they're not gonna like
[00:55:57] Who they're getting and so I'm like, you know what then we're not we're not meant to be
[00:56:03] I mean and they might be like in a job that just because they we did have a client who needed to talk to us at a very odd hour
[00:56:09] Because of them being across the world
[00:56:11] sure and
[00:56:12] And that's okay. So it's like if there's another agent out there that the night owl who doesn't mind working in the middle of the night
[00:56:20] Then that might be their clientele for me. I'm gonna say you know what
[00:56:24] Leave me all the messages you want after 10 p.m. At night
[00:56:27] I'm always going to return your messages at this time of day and if that doesn't work then
[00:56:32] Let me find an agent that works best for you. So yeah finding a lot of people who
[00:56:38] Uh
[00:56:39] Need to talk super late at night. I am I am not their girl
[00:56:44] um, and I and I also know for me too the um
[00:56:48] uh, someone who might mean need that handholding which is fine
[00:56:53] but I
[00:56:54] tend to struggle if someone needs that reassurance of maybe why they're buying a house every single day
[00:57:02] While they're buying a house and I'm like if we always feel like we're about to jump off a bridge
[00:57:07] Then I'm so sorry. I didn't do you a favor in our buyer consultation to make sure that you feel felt prepared to go through this experience
[00:57:16] um, so yeah, there's just been so I have like I feel like a whole book of uh
[00:57:22] Of you know different scenarios and I'm like I either could have approached the beginning consultation a whole lot different
[00:57:29] um or also just understand that you know hey
[00:57:34] This is how I like to be treated. This is how I like to work and if it's not okay with you then that's
[00:57:39] You know, that's where we know we're not a good match
[00:57:42] You know, you just said something really really important that I think is probably one of the keys to your success
[00:57:48] Which is here's what you didn't say oh my god. I had this one client. They were the worst and I just had to get rid of them
[00:57:54] By the way does everyone have clients like that in their experience? Of course of course they do
[00:57:59] But Danny didn't say that here's what she said instead and I think this is
[00:58:03] Really important she said, you know, we had the if I have a client who's every day going
[00:58:08] I should still don't know maybe I shouldn't maybe I
[00:58:11] Danny didn't say well, I got this wish you wash your client. She don't know what she's doing
[00:58:15] She said I didn't probably didn't do a good job of you know prepping this person or making sure that this person was ready
[00:58:22] Danny is taking responsibility for the breakdown in communication or or the breakdown in the client not the client
[00:58:29] I love that you said it that way and I don't think it's an accident you said it that way and I'm sure there are
[00:58:34] There are times when you just have crappy clients. You're like I just got rid of this person. They're disaster
[00:58:38] But and that happens of course, but I love that you said it was really me that didn't probably do a particular thing
[00:58:47] Most effectively and if we can think about our clients like that that it's probably us
[00:58:53] More than it is them. It doesn't mean we have to beat ourselves up but taking that responsibility
[00:58:58] Allows for growth right allows for like okay next time that happens. Here's what I'm gonna do
[00:59:02] And I love that you said that and I want to honor you for saying that because I heard it and I don't know that you even meant to say it that way
[00:59:10] But I love that you shared that because I really
[00:59:14] Personal responsibility is something. It's very I find that to be a very
[00:59:17] Common trait among top producers. They take responsibility and you just did that so I just wanted to
[00:59:22] A lot of rights that work for sure and I think that's where I mean
[00:59:27] Going into like the last couple of years
[00:59:29] I've I've just put myself around people that I want a positive influence from and the way their language is huge
[00:59:36] So the language of the people that you surround yourself with or even just the people you follow so
[00:59:42] Something I put in one of my social media classes is that
[00:59:46] You know pay attention to who you're following because these are the people that you're getting influenced by
[00:59:52] And um if someone else is constantly talking and like you know negative about their clients
[00:59:58] Then I kind of feel like that part of your brain is gonna be what's running more when you are with your clients
[01:00:05] You're looking for those things that you can also complain about and
[01:00:10] So yeah, I think that taking that personal responsibility and
[01:00:14] At the end of the day, it is our choice, you know like no one is forcing you to be someone's real estate agent
[01:00:19] Right and so I think that in reality if you talk if you change your mindset into abundance
[01:00:25] You turn if you figure out who is that client that you truly want to help and the more and more
[01:00:32] I got specific about who I want to help and
[01:00:36] Who I'm best fit for
[01:00:39] Absolutely has changed my like my life and my business because I was even speaking about that
[01:00:44] I don't have clients who call me at all times a day
[01:00:48] I don't have clients that they actually don't even call me on the weekends
[01:00:54] They typically send me a message and they say I'm so sorry to bother you at this time of day
[01:00:58] And so I'm like I don't think a lot of real that there's probably a good percentage of agents that don't have that
[01:01:04] Um, and I think it is. It's just how you
[01:01:08] Uh, how you present yourself how you you know hold those standards up and
[01:01:13] And then also start attracting the right people into your world
[01:01:17] So if you are listening and if you are an agent in the Dallas Fort Worth area and
[01:01:23] You're not getting what you feel you need from either the team you're on currently or you're brokerage your managing broker or your coach
[01:01:31] And you want to work with a team that has high standards but also is a lot of fun
[01:01:37] But really has amazing processes if you struggle with process with and by the way we all we all
[01:01:43] So or at least I do I mean I can certainly relate to that and this idea of learning with a team growing with a team being pushed
[01:01:53] I do I think the vast majority of us need accountability
[01:01:57] So the team if nothing else should be a place for you can go for accountability
[01:02:01] If you are looking to wanting to see what else is out there Danny and the Danny Hampton group would love
[01:02:07] To chat with you to see if you'd be a good fit and I would encourage anyone listening who does approach Danny
[01:02:13] Think about what you can offer their team start with that. Hey, I have an idea for you guys
[01:02:17] Or I think I can bring this to your team not just what can I get get get get from Danny and her team come with value
[01:02:24] I'll probably be what but be well received
[01:02:26] And so if anyone out there is interested in learning more about Danny and her team and wants to I mean jeez
[01:02:33] I would I would join your team
[01:02:35] Because you I would save years
[01:02:38] No, and I don't I don't mean that sort of it in a cute sort of way
[01:02:41] I mean that very sincerely because if I move to Dallas for worth I don't nobody
[01:02:44] Uh, I don't have a series of influence. You have all the systems built you started with basically nothing
[01:02:51] So I would appreciate that you you started with you know at a very young age
[01:02:56] And you did it a very specific way and you have a lot of wisdom and you're only 33 and you've been in this business 11 years now
[01:03:01] So there there's a lot of growth that you still have to continue on because your career is still in its infancy
[01:03:08] But you're able to bring people with you as you continue to ascend
[01:03:11] So if you're somebody who's out there looking to join a team like that and you probably should consider it
[01:03:17] Reach out to Danny again. It's the Danny Hampton D.A.N.I. Hampton on Instagram and you can Danny
[01:03:25] What is your website again? I apologize. That's that's good sold by dhd.com
[01:03:30] sold by dhd Danny Hampton groups sold by dhd.com we all have links to that both in the show notes
[01:03:36] I want to on behalf of our audience think Danny for coming on today
[01:03:41] gave a ton of great advice and lots of really impressive strategies for how agents can move their business forward
[01:03:47] Notice we didn't talk about today
[01:03:49] Then NAR settlement inventory being low interest rates being high we didn't because none of those things we can control
[01:03:55] But we can control some of the other things we talked about today
[01:03:58] So let's use this as a great reminder of taking responsibility taking accountability and let's
[01:04:05] Improve our standards right so um
[01:04:08] I want to thank Danny on behalf of the audience
[01:04:09] I want to also thank the audience on behalf of Danny and myself

So before we get to that you bought your first home at 19 And then was that the catalyst to sort of say this is what I want to do for my life or how did that come to be? I think that it definitely helped because I was already in kind of like the real estate industry I didn't see myself going into like REALTOR But I was actually working in apartments So when I was a leasing agent at an apartment complex I kind of saw like okay well if I'm in my early I'm about to go into my 20s where I'm already getting asked like am I going to college? What are you you know are you going to be a stay at home mom because I was already married I got married at 18 Probably not going to highly recommend that but I am still married to him. So I guess I should But we uh now I feel like we really just had Everything happened obviously with a purpose in a plan because I think the Best buying that first home even though we made no money on it when we sold it two years later um Introduced us to the REALTOR who planted the seed in my head that said maybe you should get your real estate license Wow and so at 22 you did that and I'm sure all of us are thinking Well, what buyer or seller in their right mind is going to choose a 22 year old now Obviously, you're not out there probably broadcasting. Hey, I'm 22 and I'm a REALTOR But at the same time you are 20 or you were 22 and a REALTOR so Getting into leasing prior to that makes a lot of sense I think that tends to be a little bit I wouldn't say easier but certainly more Understandable that somebody at that age could help somebody with leasing Obviously not as big of a commitment as buying or selling a home But you are now a REALTOR at 22 So how did you start building your business? Did you go back to any of those people that you helped on the leasing side said hey by the way Now we should talk about next steps in buying a home or did you have to start from from scratch? Rock is a combination. I think that So what one thing I knew I needed to do was that I needed to join a real estate team because I knew that You know, obviously where am I going to get my leads and if I'm not sitting in a place that has walk ins Then I'm essentially like okay, where would leads come from and then of course just already like dipping my toes into that knowing Okay, what's the sphere of influence? Where would I how would I build that and Knowing my age in itself would be one of the biggest challenges because Most of my sphere of influence either you know if they're the parents of the The kids I grew up with They're they're gonna need to see me in my career and trust me before they would actually go into a professional setting And then the the you know my friend group right like half of them. We're still living at home sure And or didn't have the money So I I knew that I needed to go to a real estate team that had an established business And that in itself is where a lot of my confidence got built up and just being able to kind of like Soak up that it's almost like you're borrowing confidence right if you're working if in proximity with someone who has already an established business I feel like the more I was able to hang out hang around those agents I was able to kind of soak up that confidence and be able to deliver that which actually a lot of the times Not many people asked my age because they felt like I spoke with enough confidence and experience because I was borrowing that from other people Yeah, the borrowing borrowing experience or borrowing language or borrowing sort of tips and strategies from You know their teammates or the team lead or just sort of soaking up You know, this is how people talk in this in this industry again probably does solve a lot of those while I'm only 22 Because it doesn't come up if you're able to effectively provide value I think so so and I also think too getting married at 18 probably helped accelerate Your maturity. I mean I would just have to I would assume because you are now forced to Live an interpersonal life with someone and be around them 24-7 most you know 18 to 22 year olds don't have that Maybe they have roommates or maybe they're in college but other than that it is it is usually a pretty solo experience So I suspect you're probably even your interpersonal skills, you know relating to others and being able to you know You were living a real life by the age of 22 And had been for several years whereas the rest of us are like all right We just graduated college. What do we do now now what I do and how do I I have to tell you? I think really because it's almost like I need to have a bio to my bio because I Left my home at the age of 15 I met my husband at that same time um, I quickly had to figure out what I needed to do for work how I was gonna finish school. I got my GED um There were a lot of things that kind of I feel like did catapult me into a Older age and I kind of I had actually kind of feel like I adopt his age a little bit because he's three years older than me So um, well, I think there's a lot of just like yes I had to grow up a little early and So there was a lot of like a people would assume I was older because I was married I I did have a little bit more inner confidence because I do have at least the social skills the life skills To be able to you know get people to relate to me and you know like me know me and trust me Yeah, well, that's that's what it's all about So you joined a team which was I think really wise decision at at that age because again your age is going is working You know to some degree against you because again your friend group are you know still living at home or renting or certainly Most of them aren't purchasing properties And again, you're like how am I gonna actually build this business? Let's learn from from people who have come before me and I think A lot of agents could benefit even if they're one or two years in the business If they're not getting the success they need or they don't feel like something's missing and they can't quite solve it That I think joining a team is is not a terrible way to go for a few years and really sort of understanding Oh, this is how it's done and then eventually you know you can you can leave if you want to But I do think it's an underutilized sort of thing and and I do encourage our listeners if you feel that You know you could use a A leg up and you're not really getting that one-on-one support or training from your firm and not every brokerage provides that That is great idea to you know reach out to a team leader up. What I so Let's I want to talk a little bit about you know building a team because Not only were you part of a team, but then years later you built a team And you are still building a team and you're you know consistently you know constantly Defining it and and figuring it out along the way and adding people and then people drop off and then you and I know how that works Everybody who runs a team knows knows the how that is But how did you go about deciding that you wanted to build one yourself? Um, so I I knew that I couldn't do it alone So I mean even with I think it helped a lot with me being on a real estate team to see how they operated Um, so you know, let's just say I already saw the good bat and ugly of real estate teams And then I decided okay, I don't know if I had a big picture of what I wanted to build which I would highly recommend that you start there um But in the moment because I already had a referral system that was coming into my business and because I was already Balancing that parent life Um, I knew that I had to have somebody else that could at least answer My clients when they have questions um, especially someone who would uh help me with paperwork because you know And probably every job now they all give you personality assessments But they of course did that in the beginning of my career And I don't even think I needed an assessment to tell me I'm not great at paperwork Um, I'm definitely not the administrator um, so I I knew that I needed Assistant help but when I realized That I needed to have other agents on the team back hood. I could leverage my listings and help Bring more buyers in and I was seeing how the opportunity could really present itself to where hey We build a brand and we can also have weeds come into this brand and Basically create that win-win because I'm gonna create all the I'll I'll build all the tools and resources for you I just need bodies essentially that came when You know be there to service the cut the clients and I knew that was probably where the team started to kind of build because my brand Everything I did for marketing. This is what I say. I'll do this is what I did right and then this what I did wrong Um, I built my brand. I built everything on the marketing side and then I didn't have like the foundation of standards and expectations and Basically what Those expectations in itself, I think is probably what needs to be highlighted because I didn't necessarily know what to expect of team members because I'm only seeing what I'm pouring in And when I realized that we didn't Communicate what I expected on the other side. I think that's where people start getting that confusion of what does my team provide and what do I provide? Yeah, that that does make a lot of sense this idea of standards is really I think really interesting and I think for those that are listening that are thinking about joining a team It is important to talk about that when you're interviewing teams to maybe join or when you're building your own team to really have a well-defined Standard of standard of practice and and really having Okay, when somebody emails us at 11 o'clock at night like what's our process like do we have to respond to it right away? Do we respond to it next morning at 8 a.m.? Like whatever whatever You know the team wants to do is is you know fine But just knowing that okay, I know for sure that's getting responded to within a certain amount of time or you know We when this happens. I do you know someone does this And that is really really important because of course you've built this incredible brand for yourself And you probably do everything you know a very you know meticulously And because it's your name it's your brand it's your business and then bringing on team members They don't always share the exact level of perfectionism or sort of you know diligence And so I think it is probably really important So do you do feel like with your team now you have a better well-defined? Here's the expectations for you know what what we're gonna do each time we get a client Yeah, there's um there has been definitely a learning process over those last five years of Just constantly redefining that and revisiting them um, you know some of those standards I feel like you know they tend to change because it's either based off the market conditions Right, I had to build certain standards and expectations when we had multiple offers all the time sure and then Um, and then when they're gets to a market where it's a little bit slower where people are able to sleep at night and put offers in a couple days later I mean, I think that expectations just get changed a little bit um, I would say just as a side note for any REALTORS who are listening that I feel like You should have expectations and standards for your clients Even if you weren't team building I think that being that clarity just helps ease both sides Um, but as far as like for team members, I think that having those standards and expectations I just feel like you have to kind of remind yourself like why you're in that position Um, because I feel like as a team agent I don't necessarily know if I ever saw myself leaving real estate teams to build my own team Until I stop stop seeing the value of the team Yeah, and I think that as a team leader we have to own the position of kind of consistently reminding them why they're here And why we're a team together because as much as it's you know glorious to Have a brand that has your name on it and you did all the hard work to put that logo together and everything um There was a point I think in the last year that I had a really good like honest and raw conversation with my team that was like You guys are making more money than me Like I am spending so much money in everything to try to keep this roof over our heads And in all honesty getting the conversation of hey, you know, I'm not happy with splits or I don't feel like I'm getting what I need Um, it's kind of it's a hard you know, it's a big pill to swallow as a team leader And I know other leaders feel this way because I've networked and masterminded with them That it's like hey, you know, we kind of we both kind of have to be Reminded why we're doing what we're doing um and those unmet expectations sometimes creep up really fast Um because they tend to change Yeah, I agreed and I think that having a north star sort of the knowing the wise and reminding Like you were saying, you know, it's like writing a mission statement for a business and then A year later you're like, didn't we do that a year ago? Do you remember what it was? So this idea of writing out standards and sort of why we're doing the things we're doing is great But our brains are are pretty fickle. They're not great at remembering things and We should have a process where regularly we're communicating with our team or our brokerage Here's why I do this. Here's what I need. Here's what I can offer You know, those those three things I think are really really important It's just like again, I'll just repeat them for anyone listening as you know, what do I what do I need from the team or what can I offer the team and And why why am I a REALTOR what am I what and what value are we providing would be the fourth, you know Why should someone choose our team right and and getting everybody on that same page Can be tricky and because people have different specialties and different personalities So I can appreciate that hustle, but I think you're so right It's the most important thing is to really understand the value of the people you work the values of the people you work with because if you know their values you can Somewhat predict their behavior right and if their values if you don't know them then it becomes more erratic So I'm curious when when you look for a team member to join you what do you look for what what this is be great Advice for any of our listeners who are thinking about maybe joining the team Yeah, so I think that um I think having a similar Work ethic definitely is one is a key factor for me because I notice that when I Am around someone who is a little bit more slower paced Um even if it's not said because maybe they want to you know, maybe they want to Be influenced by me by by one of my skills or whatever it might be um I don't think people realize how quickly I move And so I work really fast um I talk really fast um I talk about a very loud, you know tone um So there's a lot of things where I'm like I kind of have to know Their ability to work in an atmosphere that might feel a little fast paced because I think we kind of have to have a similar almost north star On my are you able to grow so um something I've actually put into my My values is that I I need someone who values personal growth because I think that I'm consistently working on my own personal development And I do expect my team members around me to have that name type of guy Yeah, I agree. It's funny. I do a similar thing in my personal romantic relationship which um The I'm in a newer relationship and one of the things that that we both have agreed upon my partner in a high is that if we both continue to grow ourselves and work on our own baggage our own insecurities our own glitches whatever you may want to call them That likely the relationship will get stronger as a result of working on an individual effort because a lot of times Individual challenges show up in the way we treat others sort of you know unconsciously even we we were upset with ourselves We take it out on our partner or you know whatever so for us in in a kind of a different way, but in a similar way Um, I'm doing the similar thing is like I my my partner and I we talk about the things we're working on individually For our personal growth and it's you know, it sounds kind of silly and but it's but it's really helpful because I'm like oh cool She's working on this one thing I can start looking for that and and maybe even give her feedback on how it's going if she wants that And then you know, we're just more in sync more communication so I firmly I firmly agree that you know Whether it's a team we're doing this in our business too. We are all reading a simple a book right now called a 21 Immutable laws of of leadership Or something like that anyway, and we're all taking chapters and every week we report on our chapter and it's a personal growth kind of thing And it helps it it helps so I love that that you know looking for that in in a teammate and also too If you work on yourself your business will get better your your relationships look at better your health will get better Everything everything improves because you're raising your own standards Absolutely, I think it definitely creates some kind of balance it gives you connection Um, so and that's something to where I feel like as I Honestly becoming a team leader has been the biggest blessing in my life because it really has set this higher level of accountability And that higher level of accountability to me um because it's kind of like I guess I guess I also see that as parenting When you're now responsible for another being then all sudden you start kind of looking inward going Oh, how am I showing up and so then when you start that in business um, I mean, it's a very uncomfortable feeling But I was like okay, I have to get up to the office at this time because I need to really lead by example and There's been a lot of um There's been a lot of instances over those last five to six years uh that I believe Truly has you know contributed to my own personal growth and development because I have people looking at me and it's not just my kids It's it's these grown adults and um and shoot some of them are even older than me And it doesn't even matter because you know we there's a reason why we're working together. We want to Um, we want to improve some area of our life Usually they're coming to me because they want to improve their professional and financial world Um, but I think that there's so much more to that. I think that's what brings you in the door Um, I think that what's Has separated team members before has been the fact of like you know what I'm really not willing to grow at that pace And I have probably been on like a 10x journey for the last couple of years Because I've done that so much inner work in the last two years That I feel like it's now going to the other side in the professional world where People are like that's way too much um because I I'm I've figured out a lot of stuff that I'm like Oh, okay, I'm gonna show up different. I'm gonna be different But I also now have higher standards of the people around me And if you're not willing to make those changes to meet those standards then I mean we're all gonna be uncomfortable Sure Yeah, no, no, I it is absolutely right. I mean it's it sort of reminds me of that expression and it well I'll have to ask the audience to take a little bit of a leap with me on this one But it really has to do with uh, I always love this. I heard it from Brian Tracy. He used to say Prospecting solves all problems and he wasn't necessarily speaking about real estate But you know if we think about like why do people leave the industry lack of leads lack of business is probably the reason or or burnout I guess maybe but burnout I see very rarely I see a lot of people leaving for for the reason of they aren't burnt out Because they didn't have enough business. So prospecting you know does kind of solve all problems related to Business as far as staying in business because it will you could be the worst REALTOR in the world But if you have leads like you're gonna do okay And of course you don't want to be a terrible REALTOR But you could be if you just had enough leads and you could probably still exist And so this idea of of personal growth is kind of the same thing. It's just like you always You know personal growth kind of solves all problems because it'll it'll sort of raise your standards It raises your output and it then encourages or leading by examples shows other team members. Here's where we're at now And again, not all team members will always make that that transition And so certainly you know teams can fluctuate over time as standards change So I think that's a really really wise thing. So look for surely set a couple of things This look for teams that have well-defined standards of practice have well-defined values have some north stars that they really live by and and remind their teammates about And then and then also You know what what we were just just mentioning. So I think I think that's a that's some great suggestions for team Team either leaders or people looking to join I want to talk a little bit about your branding because you did something incredible and I'm sure you you guys have had incredible production since this But in 2020 this is particularly interesting that somehow you during the pandemic which you know agents largely weren't working Of course as much some states they weren't able to work at all But you know you were able to work and your team closed a hundred and seven hundred and forty seven homes that year That was a tough year to do that So tell us and by the way not just close that many homes almost 150 homes You weren't buying leads and you weren't making cold calls. So tell us sort of how you did that because I know social media is a big Sort of lead gen source for you, but you have a particular sort of unique approach to it So do you mind sharing sort of how you approach social media? Sure, so um I mean first off I did a lot of failing forward with social media in the very beginning so as many people keep good into this mindset of I need to look a certain way or sound a certain way Yeah, you just got a post, you know, just just post and just keep moving forward um, but I I noticed what I did differently was um, I'm really just bringing the human aspect into social media And I think that so most of this came from Facebook just a clear anything up because now that we're talking about this in 2024 I was not a tiktokker. I was not highly I was not very active on Instagram. I definitely did more on Facebook But it was all about trying to create community and I feel like the tips that I give and coach agents on with social media is to do it on an organic level Is that first of all um, just the general rule in real estate is you've got to be you've you got to get yourself to be a person that someone can like no interest Well now figure out how to be someone you can like no interest on social media and um When I when I hear that I feel like I'm looking for someone I can relate to And I think that the thing the thing that I knew I needed to separate myself So I decided I was not going to be the lexas driving REALTOR and um, which is funny because I did buy a lexas when I made my first $100,000 So um after having two lexas I figured out my true identity and I traded it in for a Jeep um, I also started just wearing ball caps and t-shirts and man did I piss off a lot of agents in my area um And I just knew in that moment I finally found that inner confidence with myself that I was doing real estate for just a handful of years that I felt I knew who I was so I wanted to show who I was and um, I just knew my life. I was like, nope I just don't want to dress up for appointments. Well, I brought that Into my social media world because I wanted people to feel comfortable with reaching out to me and being like, you know what guys this This is me. This is how I show up and you know, it really brought down that I wouldn't say that they didn't treat me like a professional But I feel like that trust factor happened a whole lot quicker Because I now kind of almost felt like they're REALTOR friend And so I feel like my that sphere of influence that I was building became so much larger because I started to get referred To more and more people and the way people were able to reach out to me Well, be where they are. That's what I tell a lot of people like just go be where they are So even if you're calling leads try to find them on social media because that's probably where they're hanging out They don't want to be at work. They're probably scrolling their phones And so if you're able to connect with someone when they don't have that That big wall up right that the don't talk to me like it's the same one that goes up when I go into a mall and all the people in the middle one I try to get me to buy something I have that wall up but when I'm on social media accounts I'm usually walled down because I want to connect with people So I feel like the biggest you know the biggest thing I did was just being a real person online Showing who I was giving enough content that allowed people to connect with me and then just being a social person So you got to go talk to a lot of people lots of conversations lots of comments Yes, and what I like about the sort of um the attire situation where you're talking about hey, I wear a t-shirt. I wear a ball cap I I don't have any judgment upon whether that's appropriate for or not because everyone can make up their own decision of whether that fits with their own personal You know sort of dress values However, here's what it here's what is is is irrefutable if you're showing up every day on social media with your videos and your your pictures And you are wearing a ball cap and And you know t-shirt and that's your costume so to speak or or your Your uniform so to speak Well, that's what people would expect when they meet you in person too So it's not whether it's a good idea or bad idea for for somebody to decide whatever someone's personal brand You know style style brand is like that. I don't think it matters I just think choose choose something it doesn't have to be where the same close every day But have some sort of style and then if you're providing value it almost doesn't matter much what you're wearing But this idea of having a brand and also to I think Danny I think you're all you're doing yourself a huge service by dressing down And I think that would probably fly in the face of a lot of people's sort of assumption that well Maybe she's making it harder because she doesn't maybe dresses professional as other agents Well, if we look at the results the results seem to suggest that nobody seemed to care That at least in 2020 when he sold almost 150 homes So the results speak for themselves, but here's where I think it does actually help you because If they can see your results and see that you're a high producing team and my brand is that I dress down But it's not like you look you know, you know, you don't look sloppy. You're just wearing you know, uh, you know Less um business casual type of yeah and In a weird way when I see somebody who's at the top of their game or the top of that sort of industry dressing down I'm like, oh that person must really know a lot because they're not trying to impress me with their And I know that sound silly and I'm sure not everybody would have that reaction But these are people who have been following you on social media They already know what you dress like they already know how you speak what you're into you You're you talked about being authentic and honest So you you just show up in your in your regular um, you know uniform and Of course he would like why it would probably be more unusual if you showed up in in a really you know, it's a fancy dress For example, they probably be like I don't I don't know this Danny. I know the other Danny I think I actually got a few of those comments before I might have like shown up after some kind of photo shoot that I did or something And I did try to dress up and then people be like who is this Um, I and I think just did I really tag on to the being authentic and being honest I mean the more I showed up as myself and the more that I actually just talked work So there's a lot of real estate agents. I feel like that struggle with talking about real estate online And it's either that they don't want to be too salesy. I get the word salesy a lot And I'm like if you don't want to be too salesy to the people who follow you But I'm like, but that's who you want to hire you Um, there's been so many listing appointments that I've walked into that I never had to give a presentation to They already hired me before I walked in the door. So to me, I'm like because I've shared what I did If I didn't tell like the Basically the consumers I want to call me. I'm like I'm constantly advertising and Yes, you know, there is the That atypical Just sold just listed types of posts, but that doesn't prove anything to me So I'm like to the news like so this is actually what I Didn't know I was doing back in 2020 that I actually now have a strategy for But it's just truly just going people just need Proof and they also need something to connect with so it's super helpful when you're able to go Hey, I just helped someone who totally didn't feel ready to list their house We went through multiple stages to get their house ready to list We did actually do some improvements to their house. I was able to help with that because I have the resources and the people to help them do those things So we can improve their value Um, just seeing that type of actual proof And seeing where that person ended up I feel like is that connector because I I have actually a story of just someone who I didn't even know was following me That was a sibling of one of my past clients. They've been Watching all of my even the talking stories just me just getting online and talking I Apparently one day said something and both the husband and wife called each other and they said did you see Danny's recent things And they called me up and they're like we're ready to move because of one thing I said And I'm like you just got it It's almost like you just kind of got it over share And if you're not proud of what you're sharing then that's where you probably need to fix something So it's a value piece Yeah Boy, it that you know it happens to me on the podcast Occasionally a smaller version of that where because podcasting podcast listeners often are very passive They're not necessarily you know chatting or writing comments or or you know leaving reviews but I always love when someone goes you said this one thing or But it's usually not me saying it. It's the guest saying it but I heard this one really great thing from one of your guests and And you're right and that's that that it can be Just that simple and so when we when you think about content for social media What kind of content are you putting out in it when I say that I'm specifically asking Personal content, you know private life a personal life content that you're willing to share and business content So how do you figure that out? So um, I guess I kind of feel like a lot of my audience Possibly might relate to the things that I'm into or the things that I do every single day And so if I'm just balancing life with uh with my kids their ages nine and five So the entertainment levels that I have to bring to these kids Um because just so you know they're they hate commercials They have just they have let me know this weekend that they cannot watch anything that has commercials because it's just the longest three minutes of their life Yeah But I think as far as um, I just kind of look at my life and I'm just like what's something that someone can relate to? So personally in my life every single day. I'm just like what's something that they can relate to and um, how can I share it and so uh, this could go from I think of all different levels too. I think of like what's the things that people aren't sharing right like what are Challenges in life that maybe someone needs to see that someone like me who people could think is you know Doing pretty well in life that I'm struggling with and so um So yeah, I tend to have vulnerable moments online Um, I tried to hopefully lead it somewhere. It's not just the poor meat post. It's more of a Hey, you know what life has challenges and this is what I'm doing about it um Like even to the point of I think actually after 2020 When I sold 147 homes I I didn't do anything for myself care. I had no self-care regimen No Nothing. I was a workhorse Um, I didn't do anything to contribute to my marriage. I didn't do much to contribute to my parent life either I was really just in survival mode and um, everything since I have been sharing online of figuring out that daily routine that fills my cup up before I fill anybody else's cups up and um Definitely with my career now. I feel like there probably is a little less real estate and a little bit more personal life But I think that's where like I was sharing before people want to connect with people And then if you end up building that trust factor as a person in that person's world um Then obviously, you know, I start to sprinkle in the You know houses were selling or things that we're doing for clients and then they're like oh and they're in real State of course, I'm gonna work with them. Yeah Yeah, I love this idea You know, you mentioned sort of being so busy that other parts of your life, you know took a hit and Who couldn't relate to that? It's happened to all of us at some point We over-focus in one part of our life and other parts of our life suffer And so you talked about hey, you know, I wasn't really giving my marriage the attention that it needed Um, you know, maybe my children as well or or whatever You know fill in the blank with personal physical health The spiritual health emotional health whatever inter personal relationships friends family whatever it might be financial um and Everybody can relate to that right? Because in fact, I suspect that balance is imperfect and there's no way to ever actually achieve balance So ever we're always out of balance and it's I think the trick is it getting in balance the trick is knowing where you're unbalanced and just making slight adjustments Along the way to where things are as balanced as they could get But again, it requires um some vulnerability to talk about these things that maybe aren't always like hey look at me I just sold a million dollar home, you know, we want to share the successes because of course those are fun and and we know That we're going to get a good response to that but sharing the vulnerability sharing the challenges like hey guys I had this really great year But it really took a toll. I really wasn't able to give my my my primary relationship enough attention and can anyone out there relate to that? Well, here's how what I'm doing to fix that Everybody can relate to that right? Anybody in a relationship knows what it's like when a relationship stops growing and people go through you know peaks and valleys So like that's a universal experience, right? So no matter how busy somebody is at some point in a relationship both people You know go through a pies where they're just not as actively working on it or one personism So I love the idea of sharing something like that on social media because number one It's honest. It's vulnerable and it's something that is universal that we can all relate to we've all had these experiences And you know we expect people on social media to be super super heroes really we we only see people's best moments Most of the time on social so this idea of being like here's the Maybe the less perfect parts of of me that I want to you know Showcase and the reality of it is is people actually bind to imperfection versus perfection We actually bind to struggle and challenge because we all go through struggle and challenge So I love that you're talking about that. I mean let me share I I shared at the beginning of last year and this is where I feel like I got almost a whole new community starting to follow me because I shared that I discovered my ADD and Which is funny because I feel like a lot of people who've known me has like you just found that out Like we've known this your whole life And so I think that When I finally shared that I actually just decided to to really find a way to to control it and to understand it and to To work with it without going to be assumed upon Adderall or One of those really big name drugs and so I knew that I needed to Share that just so that way maybe it could be another piece that people could relate on and the Response to it was just incredible To have other people going you know what I didn't even think about you know Maybe the some of the challenges you spoke about maybe aren't the First thing to think of when you think of ADD But because you listed it now. I'm researching it and so you know And that's where social media has really changed over the years because I mean there's a lot of us who probably don't watch the news anymore Um, there's a lot of us who is kind of going through Other people's life experiences and seeing how that's it beat how they're being influenced and so Yeah, I'm just con that's I mean that's what's obviously has contributed to my own personal development and everything is because if I can be a positive influence to others Um, then that's what I hope for and I kind of been changing my mindset to being someone who lives in abundance So in hopes that I attract the right clients And the right team members and people into my world because of the positive things I'm doing to be to contribute to my community Um, that's kind of been my focus especially over this last year and Um, the other piece of it too with because you asked about the social media content Yes, I'm sharing vulnerable stuff. I'm sharing, you know, the highs and the lows I'm sharing even things that I'm doing it. We're doing in our marriage to strengthen it um, we're we're going through a lot of that um As far as the real estate side I think we need REALTORS to really get Get a little bit more creative with um The situations that we have presented to us almost every single day But how to actually market that Online for people to understand like Uh, there's so much more behind the scenes in real estate Um, then the just listed and just sold and I think that the facade of Someone only calls me when they're ready to make a move I've been recently changing a lot of my content to be like actually I just had a listing appointment for someone who wants to move in 2025 Awesome. I you know what? I love that. I love I love that so much um because people need to hear That consumers need to hear this that hey, I know you know I'm now talking to somebody who is not going to make a move for another year And here's what we're doing right now to get that person ready So if you are thinking of doing something in a year or two Call me because I can start getting you ready. I can start helping you along the way So that you know and again a great opportunity because what a REALTOR's typically do when they reach out to their sphere And they talk to them and do their you know pleasantries then it's like hey Are you looking thinking about making a move right now? No, I'm good for a few years So okay, cool. I'll just stay in touch and they're not necessarily thinking okay You have two years to go okay great I'm gonna start reaching out to you with some some ideas some tips Let's let's get you there so that when you are ready or if an opportunity comes up between now and then That you are ready to go in it just in the event where you know, maybe the market shifts dramatically Again, this idea of just like You know helping people where they're at which is what you said is really really important and um And of course we know that you know staying in touch and communication is everything So I love that you do that. I think that is is well And there were other piece of content. I've put together is so we're you know We're a husband and wife team and so um I think my husband didn't realize that I was just gonna consistently con him into becoming a REALTOR one day and You know, I started with you'll work operations and then slowly now he has been working more and more as an agent um And he's not necessarily like the person who's going out there and doing all the lead generation But he kills it on the listing side um He just has a more analytical way of looking at things and I'm I'm definitely all visual and marketing and creative and he's very like data analytics Which honestly with the market we're in right now you need someone who's obsessed with the numbers And so I am I've honestly taken a drive on my marketing side to be like, you know what First of all, I think we can help probably a lot of couples who are just like us who are trying to make a decision I'm the emotional one and he's the logic. Where's the logic? Yeah, and it's so I'm like We just had a listing appointment the other day and he ended up taking lead because they were they really were just like You know what we want to cut past the BS like we already know why we want to move We just want to make sure it's a smart decision To list our house right now because the numbers might not be in our favor Right and um and I was like so you guys really want like the data the numbers that type of information They said yes, and I said all right here's a job. I have just I have just the guy for you And and by the way, that's another really important reason why teams can be super effective is different people Of course have different buying styles different evaluative styles and knowing your style or your preferred style or what you communicate more Most effectively and knowing your husband in this case and all your team members You know knowing their styles. This of course Is you you don't have to try to be something you're not you can just pass the torch be like great my partner right here Happens to be my husband he knows all that stuff so I What again? Just because I've had a team member on my team who um because I like I said I'm loud and I'm fast And not a lot of I've had buyers in the past who were not loud and fast and they they needed a personnel That was just a little softer and just a little slower and um It does it just helps and I communicated that a lot with the team to be like sometimes you're gonna get leads that don't necessarily match you And unless you're able to have that emotional intelligence to Adjust and be and match them um, it is always in your best interest to pass that lead to an agent who is probably gonna best service them Because what you're doing is you're keeping yourself from other opportunities because you you're in constant adjustment mode And I I learned that through this 11 years To be like, you know what it's uncomfortable to adjust myself all the time I'm rather I rather just go figure out who I best work with and then we'll you know We'll just be able to have hopefully a team setting that allows everyone to be helped You know, and I too, I use it said something so wise and I want to sort of throw this out there for our audience in case They didn't also have this thought That if you are a solo agent and most agents are most agents are individual practitioners if you have a particular style of communication Maybe it's a more of an emotional interpersonal like I can really, you know, make people feel connected to me or You know, and again, it's not an either or but or for example I'm better at analytics and I'm better at factual logical sort of information or you know, whatever it might be What whatever someone's knowing your own personal style that works well for you is really important because again When you is an individual agent if you were to find you know somebody who isn't really going to understand the way you communicate And maybe you don't have a husband who's in the business who's who has those those traits She should have some other agents that you can refer business to saying hey, I got the perfect person for you I'm not the right person in this particular scenario, but my buddy or or my friend or my colleague so and so They're going to be a so much of a better fit and and then you maybe even consider teaming up with that person You know more officially But I think having those go-tos and we all think about go-tos with respect to referrals and other states Obviously, we have to have a go-to there But having a go-to in your own local market and I don't mean just somebody who works in area you don't work Somebody who works a client you don't really do well with because if you're closer ratio for these kind of clients is only 50 percent But but this other person has like a 90 percent close ratio Well, I would rather take 30 percent of the transaction give it to somebody who's going to close it and save myself the headache of trying to Communicate in a style that really isn't me Now easier said than done because we don't want to of course give up business That's hard. That's not easy to do but Danny will tell you I'm speaking for her, but I'm sure she will say one of the smartest things you can do is not work with clients who aren't a good fit Because they will sort of just wear you down and and drag you down and it's not even their fault necessarily It's just not a good match So if you had those experiences where you wished you would have you know ended a relationship A client relationship maybe before the closing itself Yep, I think that I have I mean honestly, I think that 2020 experience right like in that moment I felt like people were kind of coming in like floods and We realized at that moment we accepted everyone and that's where I've been sharing like how agents really need to have their own standards When it comes to clients and the way they work in their own standards for themselves because I think that when you If you let a client treat you however, they are going to treat you and it might not be personal It's just their personality their style whatever and that's again goes back to that inner work stuff Right, I now realize why a lot of people react the way they do why Maybe why I react the way I do maybe it was the way I you know, I was raised maybe it was the way they were raised Whatever it is the communication style is so big And if I have someone who basically calls me and is like I'm gonna always need to talk after 10 p.m. At night I know I am not my best self after 10 p.m. At night and I'm probably gonna be highly emotional and they're not gonna like Who they're getting and so I'm like, you know what then we're not we're not meant to be I mean and they might be like in a job that just because they we did have a client who needed to talk to us at a very odd hour Because of them being across the world sure and And that's okay. So it's like if there's another agent out there that the night owl who doesn't mind working in the middle of the night Then that might be their clientele for me. I'm gonna say you know what Leave me all the messages you want after 10 p.m. At night I'm always going to return your messages at this time of day and if that doesn't work then Let me find an agent that works best for you. So yeah finding a lot of people who Uh Need to talk super late at night. I am I am not their girl um, and I and I also know for me too the um uh, someone who might mean need that handholding which is fine but I tend to struggle if someone needs that reassurance of maybe why they're buying a house every single day While they're buying a house and I'm like if we always feel like we're about to jump off a bridge Then I'm so sorry. I didn't do you a favor in our buyer consultation to make sure that you feel felt prepared to go through this experience um, so yeah, there's just been so I have like I feel like a whole book of uh Of you know different scenarios and I'm like I either could have approached the beginning consultation a whole lot different um or also just understand that you know hey This is how I like to be treated. This is how I like to work and if it's not okay with you then that's You know, that's where we know we're not a good match You know, you just said something really really important that I think is probably one of the keys to your success Which is here's what you didn't say oh my god. I had this one client. They were the worst and I just had to get rid of them By the way does everyone have clients like that in their experience? Of course of course they do But Danny didn't say that here's what she said instead and I think this is Really important she said, you know, we had the if I have a client who's every day going I should still don't know maybe I shouldn't maybe I Danny didn't say well, I got this wish you wash your client. She don't know what she's doing She said I didn't probably didn't do a good job of you know prepping this person or making sure that this person was ready Danny is taking responsibility for the breakdown in communication or or the breakdown in the client not the client I love that you said it that way and I don't think it's an accident you said it that way and I'm sure there are There are times when you just have crappy clients. You're like I just got rid of this person. They're disaster But and that happens of course, but I love that you said it was really me that didn't probably do a particular thing Most effectively and if we can think about our clients like that that it's probably us More than it is them. It doesn't mean we have to beat ourselves up but taking that responsibility Allows for growth right allows for like okay next time that happens. Here's what I'm gonna do And I love that you said that and I want to honor you for saying that because I heard it and I don't know that you even meant to say it that way But I love that you shared that because I really Personal responsibility is something. It's very I find that to be a very Common trait among top producers. They take responsibility and you just did that so I just wanted to A lot of rights that work for sure and I think that's where I mean Going into like the last couple of years I've I've just put myself around people that I want a positive influence from and the way their language is huge So the language of the people that you surround yourself with or even just the people you follow so Something I put in one of my social media classes is that You know pay attention to who you're following because these are the people that you're getting influenced by And um if someone else is constantly talking and like you know negative about their clients Then I kind of feel like that part of your brain is gonna be what's running more when you are with your clients You're looking for those things that you can also complain about and So yeah, I think that taking that personal responsibility and At the end of the day, it is our choice, you know like no one is forcing you to be someone's real estate agent Right and so I think that in reality if you talk if you change your mindset into abundance You turn if you figure out who is that client that you truly want to help and the more and more I got specific about who I want to help and Who I'm best fit for Absolutely has changed my like my life and my business because I was even speaking about that I don't have clients who call me at all times a day I don't have clients that they actually don't even call me on the weekends They typically send me a message and they say I'm so sorry to bother you at this time of day And so I'm like I don't think a lot of real that there's probably a good percentage of agents that don't have that Um, and I think it is. It's just how you Uh, how you present yourself how you you know hold those standards up and And then also start attracting the right people into your world So if you are listening and if you are an agent in the Dallas Fort Worth area and You're not getting what you feel you need from either the team you're on currently or you're brokerage your managing broker or your coach And you want to work with a team that has high standards but also is a lot of fun But really has amazing processes if you struggle with process with and by the way we all we all So or at least I do I mean I can certainly relate to that and this idea of learning with a team growing with a team being pushed I do I think the vast majority of us need accountability So the team if nothing else should be a place for you can go for accountability If you are looking to wanting to see what else is out there Danny and the Danny Hampton group would love To chat with you to see if you'd be a good fit and I would encourage anyone listening who does approach Danny Think about what you can offer their team start with that. Hey, I have an idea for you guys Or I think I can bring this to your team not just what can I get get get get from Danny and her team come with value I'll probably be what but be well received And so if anyone out there is interested in learning more about Danny and her team and wants to I mean jeez I would I would join your team Because you I would save years No, and I don't I don't mean that sort of it in a cute sort of way I mean that very sincerely because if I move to Dallas for worth I don't nobody Uh, I don't have a series of influence. You have all the systems built you started with basically nothing So I would appreciate that you you started with you know at a very young age And you did it a very specific way and you have a lot of wisdom and you're only 33 and you've been in this business 11 years now So there there's a lot of growth that you still have to continue on because your career is still in its infancy But you're able to bring people with you as you continue to ascend So if you're somebody who's out there looking to join a team like that and you probably should consider it Reach out to Danny again.
