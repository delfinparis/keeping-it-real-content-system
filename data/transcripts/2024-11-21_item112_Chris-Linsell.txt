[00:01:24] Today's episode is brought to you by corded.io.
[00:01:27] Are you looking for agents to join your brokerage team?
[00:01:31] Now as a real estate recruiter, I can tell you the answer is always yes.
[00:01:36] But most agents aren't looking to move right now.
[00:01:38] So how do you know who to contact?
[00:01:41] Well, what if I were to tell you there's a recruiting and retention tool powered by
[00:01:44] artificial intelligence that shows you exactly which agents in your local market are
[00:01:49] looking to leave their brokerage right now and which agents at your own firm are also
[00:01:55] looking to leave you?
[00:01:56] Now I've been recruiting REALTORS for 15 years and I've hired over 2,000 agents.

[00:02:10] and shows you which agents they believe are likely to move.
[00:02:14] Not only does it do that, but corded's AI went and visited my recruiting website and
[00:02:19] read everything I offer.
[00:02:20] So now when I'm recruiting, corded's AI tells me exactly what to say based on that
[00:02:26] agent's needs and what my brokerage can offer.
[00:02:28] It even writes emails for me.
[00:02:30] I've never seen anything like it and I use it every single day.

[00:02:45] And now onto the show.
[00:03:00] Welcome to Keeping It Real, the largest podcast made by real estate agents and for real estate
[00:03:06] agents.
[00:03:06] My name is DJ Paris.
[00:03:07] I'm your guide and host to the through the show.
[00:03:10] Today is our monthly series called unpopular real estate opinions with Chris Lincel.
[00:03:14] Chris Lincel is a real estate technology analyst and he is also a director of content at
[00:03:20] large.
[00:03:21] He specializes in new solutions to old questions, constantly exploring the cutting edge of technology
[00:03:26] in the real estate space.
[00:03:28] Chris also has many years of experience as a licensed REALTOR in the state of Michigan
[00:03:31] and has worked as a marketer, digital strategist and a trainer for major national brands like
[00:03:36] Berkshire Hathaway Home Services of Michigan and Coltville Banker Schmitt REALTORS.
[00:03:40] Chris is currently the director of content with luxury presence and Chris will be speaking
[00:03:46] at the NAR convention coming up next week, I believe.
[00:03:50] I'll be there next week, baby.
[00:03:52] Come find it.
[00:03:53] And to find all of Chris's speaking engagements and to connect with him on social media, go
[00:03:58] to his website, ChrisLincel.com.
[00:04:01] That's two L's on Lincel.
[00:04:02] We'll have a link to that in our show notes.
[00:04:05] Chris, welcome once again.
[00:04:07] DJ, good to see you.
[00:04:08] Happy Wednesday.
[00:04:10] Happy Wednesday.
[00:04:11] We're here.
[00:04:12] 
[00:04:12] It's the day after the presidential election.
[00:04:16] So I thought we should, without going into our personal feelings about, you know, the
[00:04:24] results, maybe just talk about how a little bit about how it may affect agents or what
[00:04:30] we think, how we think it might do to the housing market.
[00:04:35] But I will say this just at the top, Chris and I were talking about this ahead of time,
[00:04:39] is that, you know, I assume everyone listening here is not the kind of person that would do
[00:04:46] this, but if you are, maybe give it a second thought before posting anything on social
[00:04:51] media today when emotions are high about your particular feelings.
[00:04:56] You know, I was looking at the popular vote because I was curious and who actually won
[00:05:01] the number of votes versus the electoral college.
[00:05:04] And it was about, it's about 50, 50.
[00:05:06] So keeping in mind that about half the country voted one way and the other half voted a different
[00:05:12] way.
[00:05:13] You know, I would think in this market, which is a challenging market to alienate anybody
[00:05:19] based upon your political beliefs.
[00:05:22] You know, that's, that's a risk that you should consider whether it would be a smart idea
[00:05:27] to take.
[00:05:29] My personal opinion is, you know, why alienate people, but, but that's your decision.
[00:05:36] So just be mindful of that.
[00:05:37] Things on social media do live forever.
[00:05:39] And I've seen some pretty extreme posts already from agents who are also running their
[00:05:45] business to some degree on social media.
[00:05:47] So just be mindful of that, everybody and, you know, make decisions that a year from now,
[00:05:52] as you look back, you would say, hey, that was a, that was a smart play.
[00:05:56] So, yeah, anyway, just a little top of the top of the morning or top of the podcast
[00:06:01] has suggested.
[00:06:02] You know, I would say, you know, I think that's an important message, DJ, and I want to
[00:06:08] add to, I want to add to that idea, the following, the following thought process that I encourage
[00:06:16] real estate professionals to walk themselves through.
[00:06:20] If you've listened to the show before, you've heard me wax poetic about how outlets like
[00:06:28] social media have become what I call verification marketing in the, in the, in the flywheel that
[00:06:39] is the real estate marketing machine.
[00:06:42] And what I mean by verification marketing is this is a place where your clients and your
[00:06:49] prospects and the people who you are being referred to and other community leaders and
[00:06:58] business professionals who you want to network with.
[00:07:00] These are, this is the place, social media, where all of those people are coming to verify
[00:07:07] that you are who you say you are and that you can do what you say you can do.
[00:07:11] And to some degree in uncomplicated times, what that often is, you know, it results in is
[00:07:21] them seeing that yes, you do have experience selling condos on the gold coast or yes, you do
[00:07:28] have experience working with first time home buyers who want to actually consider a duplex and rent
[00:07:35] one half of it and kind of house hack their way into their first purchase.
[00:07:39] That in a simple universe is what they are verifying there.
[00:07:44] But in reality, in the universe, we actually live in, especially in a day and age where real
[00:07:53] estate consumers have a lot of choice between who they work with.
[00:08:01] Many clients are also looking to verify that who they are working with aligns with their personal
[00:08:10] set of values and must have.
[00:08:15] Not to borrow, you know, a phrase from from cheesy kind of real estate speak, but what's your
[00:08:20] list of must have's?
[00:08:21] There are definitely consumers who have must have's on their list for who they work with that
[00:08:29] don't include only your real estate experience.
[00:08:33] 
[00:08:34] And so be mindful of the fact that whatever you share on social media is a component of the
[00:08:41] verification, the book of verification that your clients will use to determine whether or not
[00:08:48] you're a good fit for them.
[00:08:50] Apart from that, I would also encourage folks as you're thinking about the sorts of political
[00:08:57] messaging that is important enough that you share it with your community is to think about
[00:09:07] as a professional.
[00:09:11] What are the things that a donut shop could say online that would cause you to say, you know what,
[00:09:18] I'm not going to get donuts there anymore.
[00:09:20] Right.
[00:09:21] That in itself, just to kind of go through that exercise, to think like one of the things that
[00:09:28] that that donut shop could say online that would cause me to choose to go somewhere else for my
[00:09:32] donuts, donuts are a couple of bucks a piece.
[00:09:36] The threshold there is going to be, or excuse me, the not the threshold, the ramifications,
[00:09:45] like the much more significant for filters, much more significant when your donuts that you're
[00:09:52] selling are actually the $10,000, $20,000 commission checks that you might be getting on, say,
[00:09:58] a luxury property.
[00:09:59] So think to yourself, like if you're running, if you're considering whether or not this donut shop
[00:10:04] has crossed the line, you're running your own donut shop here, guys.
[00:10:08] So don't lose sight of the fact that for better or worse, as real estate professionals,
[00:10:15] we are not just in sales, we are in community.
[00:10:20] And if you choose to build a community that only incorporates a certain political view,
[00:10:29] you are choosing by default who you're not going to include in that community.
[00:10:34] So be thoughtful about that.
[00:10:36] Yeah, inclusivity, I think, is an idea that should work for the effectiveness of getting more
[00:10:47] business. So if we just look at, if I include, if I try not to exclude a certain part of the
[00:10:53] population, because, and again, it's a personal decision, if you feel strongly, you don't want to
[00:10:59] work with people with certain beliefs, that's fine. But they're going to do the same thing to you,
[00:11:04] right? So what you want to do is really be mindful of, yeah, like Chris said, I own a store,
[00:11:10] even though it's maybe not a true brick and mortar, my business is a store. And do I want to
[00:11:17] dissuade people from coming in based on a belief about politics that may or may not even be
[00:11:25] directly related to my business? Yeah, 100%. And like, let's, excuse me, let's gain this out a
[00:11:31] little bit. If you're a team leader or you are a managing broker and you've got people that work
[00:11:36] for you, you don't just have customer considerations here. You got people who are also a component of
[00:11:45] your success by virtue of the business that they bring in that you may alienate one direction or
[00:11:52] another by choosing to use those platforms that are professional verification tools for personal
[00:12:00] messaging. So, you know, this kind of actually leads DJ into what I was hoping we could talk a little
[00:12:06] bit about today. Whenever there are big cultural shifts, like, like the one that happened yesterday,
[00:12:14] via the presidential election for, you know, in one direction or another, whether you think it's a
[00:12:18] good or a bad, it's always a good opportunity to do just a quick recap of not the subjective, not like
[00:12:28] what we believe is whether or not this is good or bad, but to look at the objective signposts
[00:12:35] that are in the ground right now that are indicating the health direction and hopefully
[00:12:43] the opportunity in our markets. Great. Well, I want to start by just talking a little bit about
[00:12:49] a couple of statistics that have dropped in the last week or so. The first one, I want to talk
[00:12:57] a little bit about young and first time home buyers. The average age for first time home buyers
[00:13:04] has gone up significantly. We are now pushing 40 years old as the average age for the first time
[00:13:13] that Americans buy their homes. 38 years old is now the age. This is up significantly even just
[00:13:20] over a year ago from now. Yeah, last year was at 35. And I remember when I first got into this
[00:13:28] business well over 10, maybe 14 years ago, I probably saw this 10 years ago was around 31 was the
[00:13:35] average age. So it is creeping up. Yeah, because it's not creeping up anymore now, it's shooting up.
[00:13:41] Shooting up. And in fact, the average age of a real estate seller in the United States is over 63.
[00:13:51] Which is, you know, that's that's kind of a confusing and almost deceptive
[00:14:00] statistic because it accounts for a lot of different sales. But this age has increased over
[00:14:08] the last year by five years. It was 58 and now it's 63. And it does kind of lend itself to this
[00:14:16] overall trend that is really represented by the fact that that now first time home buyers
[00:14:23] represent less than 25% of sides of real estate transactions in the United States. That's down from
[00:14:31] 32% in 2023. It's pretty wild. So we're seeing less first time home buyers and we're seeing fewer
[00:14:41] first time home buyers in the last 12 months and we're seeing the average age of home buyers and
[00:14:48] sellers raising. That's right. Yeah, that's right. And you know, it's important to think about the
[00:14:54] conditions that are making this reality. Okay, think about the market conditions. And of course
[00:15:01] everybody's conditions are a little bit different. This is something important. People are sick
[00:15:06] of hearing me say this, but I'm going to just keep saying it because there's always going to be
[00:15:09] someone who's the first time you've heard it real estate is a micro market business. And we make
[00:15:15] the mistake often of talking about it in macro terms because that's what's easy to to write about
[00:15:21] in the New York Times, the front pages of the New York Times or on CNBC. We talk about these big
[00:15:26] national averages. And that's nice for a sound bite. But real estate is a micro market business where
[00:15:32] what really matters is what's happening on the streets, on the individual blocks of the communities
[00:15:38] that you serve. But I'm large scale and generally happening in most markets. We have market conditions
[00:15:45] that are not favorable by any means to first time home buyers. Think about think about what's happening
[00:15:51] right now. Money is expensive. Mortgage rates, they have come down, but they are still
[00:15:55] historically high relative to the trends that we've seen in the last five years. Inventory is tight
[00:16:03] despite the fact that we have seen some loosening, there is still way too few houses relative to
[00:16:10] the amount of buyers that are actually in the field right now. Right. So we have inventory that is
[00:16:17] tight. Money is expensive to borrow. So it reduces the buying power of first time home buyers,
[00:16:24] which is typically a limited amount of buying power to begin with. And because buying power,
[00:16:32] because of these factors, many of the property owners of existing homes are holding tighter
[00:16:40] on to their properties because it doesn't make a lot of sense to sell them. What we see now is
[00:16:47] more and more. I bet you there is every every REALTOR listening to this either knows somebody
[00:16:53] who is considered or is doing this instead of selling their current property because they've
[00:16:59] got a mortgage rate that is so favorable. They're going to just keep this bad boy and just try to rent
[00:17:05] it because they can definitely get more in rent than what they're paying in their mortgage and in
[00:17:11] their property taxes. If they're going to buy a new place, they're just going to wind up holding
[00:17:15] that second property and using it as a rental, which might be great for their wealth development,
[00:17:22] but it is not great at all for the housing market and outlook of people trying to enter the
[00:17:29] home ownership space. Yeah. So and we also had a couple of years of pretty significant inflation,
[00:17:37] which also affects people's savings and their ability to save and ability to borrow. So there's
[00:17:44] a lot of challenges for younger first time home buyers that and we were seeing them sort of
[00:17:53] it appears rejecting to some degree the idea of home ownership or wanting it and not being able
[00:18:00] to. It's unclear, you know, is there motivation to buy and is just conditions unfavorable or is it
[00:18:09] that culturally we're shifting away from home ownership as a sort of, you know, assumed goal for
[00:18:17] adulthood? That's a great question. And you know, the same study from the National Association of
[00:18:23] REALTORS has quoted that multi-generational housing purchases are at their all-time high. 17%
[00:18:30] of residential single-family residential homes that were purchased or sold in the United States
[00:18:39] in 2023 and the first half of 2024 included some sort of component of multi-generational occupancy,
[00:18:48] which means we've got an adult child that's living here or maybe grandma and grandpa are going
[00:18:53] to live with us here. Seven that one in eight that is an insane statistic relative to what the
[00:18:59] quote-unquote American dream was just thirty or twenty five years ago. And we've seen this play out too.
[00:19:06] Redfin did a study in February of 2024 around housing affordability as a political concern.
[00:19:15] 91% of Gen Z respondents to the study cited housing affordability not just as a concern but as
[00:19:26] absolutely set the alarm bells off for people both from a market perspective but also from an
[00:19:34] opportunity perspective. We have so many people who are thinking about this and worried about this.
[00:19:41] That is a prime opportunity for real estate professionals to develop expertise around meeting the
[00:19:49] needs that are coming from that worry. You will ingratiate yourself into those communities so fast.
[00:19:57] If you have answers to the questions that that population is asking. That's really interesting and
[00:20:03] I want to just define Gen Z because I was I had forgotten exactly what the parameters were when we
[00:20:10] say Gen Z. So Gen Z is a well-justical current ages in 2024. Gen Z goes all the way down to 12
[00:20:17] year olds up to 27 year olds. So it's a it's a big swath and these are going to be your future
[00:20:23] clients. And to your point I think the multi-generational trend that we're seeing inside of you know
[00:20:33] single family individual homes is is we're starting to see people you know moving back or we've
[00:20:40] seen people move back or or passing along home from generation to generation. I think that my my
[00:20:48] my guess is in most markets. If the family if generations have resided in that community. I would
[00:20:57] think it would be a really really good idea to get in front of as much of the family as possible
[00:21:04] and really immerse yourself in the community of the family because again there may be some home
[00:21:11] sharing there may be some home. I mean we we see it here in Chicago all the time. We see families
[00:21:16] you know have biothree flattened their kids live in one of the units or they have a home and
[00:21:22] one of the kids is going through a tough time so they move back home. It's it's or the parents
[00:21:27] are elderly and the kids need to take care of them. This is very very common and what we're I think it's
[00:21:34] a really interesting play. I was talking to a friend of mine who who was who was with Aria which
[00:21:41] or sorry Naurap the the the Hispanic national I'm sorry the Hispanic Association of
[00:21:47] Organ side the Hispanic Hispanic National Association of Hispanic Real Estate Professionals.
[00:21:53] There you go. Oh my gosh. Oh my gosh. I'm technically I'm Hispanic and I couldn't get that out
[00:21:58] but or I have a Hispanic name at least but anyway she was saying that this is what REALTORS
[00:22:04] who are not Hispanic don't understand about Hispanics is that they they make collective decisions
[00:22:10] here in the US around homes. The whole family is involved in the decision most of the kind and 49
[00:22:16] percent of all home buyers last year were Hispanic or first time home buyers rather. So that is
[00:22:22] an incredible statistic. So we're really talking about community getting involved and understanding
[00:22:28] sort of that it isn't just you know you know uh the eight 21 year old you know getting married
[00:22:36] and moving out on their own. Yeah 100 percent. So let's let's talk for a minute about what
[00:22:43] real estate professionals who are hearing this what you can do to take this information and turn
[00:22:50] it into an opportunity for yourself in 2025. So that's a couple of things that I think are really
[00:22:55] important here. The first is and man I'm going to get some crap for this even just in Boston
[00:23:02] at NAR next week. So if you're listening NAR I'm still excited to come don't cancel me.
[00:23:08] There is a there is a definitely better than 0 percent chance that there's going to be pretty
[00:23:14] significant changes to the National Association of REALTORS policy around clear cooperation coming
[00:23:19] up very soon. I don't have any insider info on this but my gut tells me we're going to have changes
[00:23:26] to clear cooperation that are going to affect the way that real estate professionals market
[00:23:31] properties and it will likely give rise to private listing networks that are servicing specific
[00:23:40] communities. If you are in a housing market where there is a particular
[00:23:49] a particular gap in the inventory and serviceability of first time home buyers this is a chance
[00:23:59] to use a shift that might happen on clear cooperation to either develop or to start planning how you
[00:24:09] can partner with other local professionals around private listing network access that is designed
[00:24:16] specifically to benefit first time home buyers. And I'm talking about it can be something as basic
[00:24:22] as a group text chain. I mean that is that is like the the the the most basic iteration and I'm not
[00:24:31] suggesting you do this right now because it's against clear cooperation and I want you to get in
[00:24:34] but you can be thinking about how you can benefit the specific underservist and clearly
[00:24:44] in need portions of your market by virtue of developing the connections that they need in order to
[00:24:52] stay competitive and ultimately be successful. So that's one thing to think about the other thing
[00:24:57] I want you to think about is in light of the election season there is a whole new swath
[00:25:06] of local representatives who hold some very important positions when it comes to determining
[00:25:15] a lot of stuff including the planning for new construction and housing development. These are folks
[00:25:24] that have either been freshly reelected and are reinvigorated to continue to represent their
[00:25:30] communities and make good decisions based on what their communities need or even better for you
[00:25:36] if you're a real estate agent. They're new to the job and they are looking for wins on how they can
[00:25:42] create value in their position so that the next time election comes around they have a track record
[00:25:50] of positive movement to point to. These are folks that you can go to and I have the list
[00:25:59] I have the list of my locals right here of the new folks who are on the planning commission
[00:26:06] who are the new drain commissioners who are the new township trustees and representatives.
[00:26:14] These are folks who I want personal relationships with and if you are a real estate professional
[00:26:20] there are very few people whose personal relationship is more valuable than the drain commissioner
[00:26:28] than the person who's head of the planning commission than the person or people who are going
[00:26:34] to green light the new multi-family housing complex that is proposed to be built
[00:26:42] on five acres of what was for a long time unused land somewhere. These are your people and if I can
[00:26:53] if I could point to one thing that would be the most effective for supporting first time home
[00:27:02] ownership in communities and just generally loosening the grip that this tight inventory has on
[00:27:09] markets it's new inventory new inventory is not going to come from a whole bunch of people deciding
[00:27:17] to put their home on their existing home on the market right now that's just not going to happen
[00:27:20] that won't let rates go down that's not going to happen it's not going to happen I will bet you
[00:27:27] my list right here I believe you that's just not going to happen if it does that'd be great
[00:27:32] but I'll eat my hat before that happen me frankly the most effective way is going to be
[00:27:39] infusing markets with new inventory new inventory gets infused via new construction new construction
[00:27:49] happens through the gates through the permission gates of these local elected officials you have a
[00:27:56] whole bunch of people who are brand new and looking to make a good impact and develop a positive
[00:28:04] image now is the time their phone numbers are public blow them up before your colleagues do because
[00:28:11] you want to get on their in their good graces before anyone else does yeah and you want to know
[00:28:16] what their agendas are and what their goals are around housing they can if if they're in alignment
[00:28:23] with your goals and if you feel that you know their things are headed in the right direction you
[00:28:29] ask them how can I support you how can I help you create more opportunity in our area and
[00:28:38] we're probably like you said we're probably talking about development and in development you know
[00:28:43] it's funny sort of dub tails into a question I get all the time is how do I get to work with
[00:28:48] developers that sounds really cool I'd like to you know be the exclusive agent on on a new development
[00:28:54] well these are how these are ways in which you can start to immerse yourself in that community instead
[00:29:00] of always directly going just to the developers themselves and saying pick me pick me I would with
[00:29:06] Chris's suggestion which is a wonderful suggestion go to the government uh you know the government
[00:29:12] affairs people the people that actually you know are do handle permits handle zoning and and get a
[00:29:20] sense to say hey I'm a REALTOR in my area I want to keep our you know our micro market here
[00:29:26] thriving and I'd like to know a little bit more about what you know what the goals are of you
[00:29:32] and what I can do to help you and you know how can I encourage more people to live here or
[00:29:39] develop property here and that in and of itself is is going to net you some very interesting
[00:29:45] conversations totally totally and let me let me add one other thing because I know that there were
[00:29:51] not not the there were definitely more than zero ballot initiatives across major housing markets
[00:29:58] in the United States this month that included the ability for homeowners to add accessory dwellings
[00:30:10] onto their single family home with much less restrictions this was something certainly in the
[00:30:16] Midwest that we saw a fair amount of these these ADUs accessory dwelling units which basically in
[00:30:24] layman's terms it's like can I put an apartment above my garage this is an actual way to take your
[00:30:32] existing inventory and turn it into extra housing stock it isn't something you necessarily would sell
[00:30:39] you're not going to build a condo above your garage of your single family home and then sell just
[00:30:44] that condo but you would turn it into a rental unit most of these you know in my local market
[00:30:53] turning these ADUs into rentals requires them to be long-term rentals not short-term rentals
[00:30:58] and even though that's not necessarily the solution to tight inventory for first time home buyers
[00:31:06] it does relieve some pressure from the people who are looking to rent and can't find anything to rent
[00:31:16] and so buying becomes an option for them it does give those folks more options it's just one of these
[00:31:24] realities that when you have a very tight housing market rental the rental market tends to tighten as
[00:31:32] well if you can loosen the rental market a little bit the bottom of the housing market tends to loosen
[00:31:39] just a little bit too it's not going to be enough that it's going to absolutely change the
[00:31:43] complexion of your local housing market but if you are in a situation like many of us were
[00:31:51] not even a year or two years ago where first time home buyers were facing competition against 10 to
[00:31:59] 15-20 different offers even if you could reduce that by 20 percent it would be a meaningful change
[00:32:06] for a lot of folks and hopefully reduce some of that frustration that they're feeling.
[00:32:11] Yeah and going just sort of all the way back to the beginning of our conversation talking about how
[00:32:19] first time home buyers are aging they're getting older and I think my my instinct tells me
[00:32:30] and again Chris you may need to correct me but my instinct is telling me that there's just not a lot
[00:32:38] of education around the benefits of home ownership that the average you know 25-year-old may have
[00:32:47] encountered or learned and I think what what REALTORS can do at this point since we know that you
[00:32:55] know pricing right now it's it's more difficult to purchase a home I think right now is the time
[00:33:01] to really start talking to younger people about the benefits of home ownership why it can make sense
[00:33:09] go through the numbers you know and really start to have those conversations I would be talking to
[00:33:16] renters all day long right now getting them ready say let's let's create a plan well first of all
[00:33:23] let's first make the case that home ownership is what you you know what you may want to do if they're
[00:33:28] on board with that now let's make a plan and once you make a plan then you're you're they're
[00:33:33] they're person you just follow the plan check in with them I see that as you know I would love to
[00:33:39] see that first time home buyer of course all of us would that age come down and the only way I think
[00:33:46] we're going to do that is through education or if rates just drop which they're not going to most
[00:33:50] likely so I would think education is probably the way to go here yeah I agree completely there is
[00:33:58] for for better or worse there is a lot of mediocre information on the internet right now about
[00:34:05] the benefits of home ownership it's not that the the benefits are mediocre literally the information
[00:34:12] and presentation of that information is mediocre because we are experiencing this influx of
[00:34:18] artificial intelligence written content that is is just you know it's it's reading these AI
[00:34:24] plans are reading the content the other AI plans have written and just recycling it recycling it
[00:34:31] recycling it follow my advice from before and treat this topic as a micro market topic yeah what
[00:34:37] are the benefits that the buyers in your market could get if they turn from renter to buyer what are
[00:34:46] the specific benefits that people who live in your community not in my community in your community
[00:34:53] that they could receive if you can create a compelling case around that particular value proposition
[00:35:01] you become the advisor the pre-purchase advisor of a ton of different people who are like yeah I'm
[00:35:10] renting I would love to be a homeowner I'm not ready I don't I don't have the I don't have the
[00:35:15] resources or the facility or the timeline to do so but maybe in a year from now you're going to
[00:35:20] get a lot of that I guarantee you most of the seeds that you plant are going to be long nurture seeds
[00:35:27] but imagine imagine where your business will be if you continue to chug along doing what you're
[00:35:34] doing right now planting a whole bunch of long nurture seeds and then a year from now when it's
[00:35:40] time to start harvesting your transaction volume will be up to three four ten x relative to the
[00:35:46] number of those seeds that you have planted because the reality is in most super tight first time
[00:35:52] home buyer markets there are a ton of renters because they don't have any other place to go if they
[00:35:58] want to live there they have to rent I know for me there are there are nearly as many rental units
[00:36:04] in my local community as there are homes that would even be that would qualify for first time home
[00:36:12] buyers like in terms of the size and price point that they'd be at so there are a ton of people
[00:36:18] that are waiting in the wings start nurturing those people by virtue of value propositions that
[00:36:24] makes sense for them not these generic messages that belong on on PSAs before your local news
[00:36:32] and I would also add to that team up with other businesses in your local market that are looking
[00:36:39] for the same consumer that you're looking for right what there's obvious ones that you can think of
[00:36:46] but there are also restaurants there are clothing shops there are retail establishments that need
[00:36:53] bodies to come into the store to buy things and if you can say to them hey I want to put more bodies
[00:36:59] in this neighborhood to come and support your store can we work together on creating some sort of
[00:37:07] educational movement to get people to want to move to this area or certainly to develop here or
[00:37:12] at least moving from renting to buying why should they do people should have the information so that
[00:37:19] they can make the right decision but what typically happens is people just keep renting yeah so truth
[00:37:25] yeah so I think it's a great place to wrap up it's definitely a strange day in an American history
[00:37:32] we we've had a bunch of firsts today with the election the 47th election and very unusual day so be
[00:37:41] mindful out there be be kind be compassionate and let's look for similarities not differences and
[00:37:47] let's remember this we are in this to to help people with their housing needs and let's just be as
[00:37:56] be as kind as we can yeah agreed be as kind as you can what a great way to end up
[00:38:02] be as kind as you can and if you can't be kind just you know just keep your mouth closed that's
[00:38:07] the easiest way that that's what I would just recommend okay well for all things Chris Chris speaks
[00:38:13] at all sorts of conferences all over the country he's going to be at the National Association of
[00:38:17] REALTORS Conference next week please go check out his sessions and let us know what you think of

[00:38:34] what I call brand tech the the latest and the greatest technology tools that you can use to build
[00:38:42] a differentiated brand in 2025 so I'm going to make some I'm going to make some provocative
[00:38:46] predictions I'm going to call out some platforms as ones you should be using even a couple that
[00:38:52] most people think they should be on but you should absolutely not waste another second on I guarantee
[00:38:58] you I'm going to get a lot of people arguing with me about it in the chat and live afterwards so
[00:39:04] come argue with me I would love to hear from you and I will if anyone from National Association of
[00:39:10] REALTORS is listening to the show please record these the sessions and make them available for

Now as a real estate recruiter, I can tell you the answer is always yes. But most agents aren't looking to move right now. So how do you know who to contact? Well, what if I were to tell you there's a recruiting and retention tool powered by artificial intelligence that shows you exactly which agents in your local market are looking to leave their brokerage right now and which agents at your own firm are also looking to leave you? Now I've been recruiting REALTORS for 15 years and I've hired over 2,000 agents. I can tell you with no exaggeration, this is the tool I've been waiting for. Corded's AI looks for trends across dozens of variables for each agent in your market and shows you which agents they believe are likely to move.

Chris, welcome once again. DJ, good to see you. Happy Wednesday. Happy Wednesday. We're here. It's the day after the presidential election. So I thought we should, without going into our personal feelings about, you know, the results, maybe just talk about how a little bit about how it may affect agents or what we think, how we think it might do to the housing market. But I will say this just at the top, Chris and I were talking about this ahead of time, is that, you know, I assume everyone listening here is not the kind of person that would do this, but if you are, maybe give it a second thought before posting anything on social media today when emotions are high about your particular feelings. You know, I was looking at the popular vote because I was curious and who actually won the number of votes versus the electoral college. And it was about, it's about 50, 50. So keeping in mind that about half the country voted one way and the other half voted a different way. You know, I would think in this market, which is a challenging market to alienate anybody based upon your political beliefs. You know, that's, that's a risk that you should consider whether it would be a smart idea to take. My personal opinion is, you know, why alienate people, but, but that's your decision. So just be mindful of that. Things on social media do live forever. And I've seen some pretty extreme posts already from agents who are also running their business to some degree on social media. So just be mindful of that, everybody and, you know, make decisions that a year from now, as you look back, you would say, hey, that was a, that was a smart play. So, yeah, anyway, just a little top of the top of the morning or top of the podcast has suggested. You know, I would say, you know, I think that's an important message, DJ, and I want to add to, I want to add to that idea, the following, the following thought process that I encourage real estate professionals to walk themselves through. If you've listened to the show before, you've heard me wax poetic about how outlets like social media have become what I call verification marketing in the, in the, in the flywheel that is the real estate marketing machine. And what I mean by verification marketing is this is a place where your clients and your prospects and the people who you are being referred to and other community leaders and business professionals who you want to network with. These are, this is the place, social media, where all of those people are coming to verify that you are who you say you are and that you can do what you say you can do. And to some degree in uncomplicated times, what that often is, you know, it results in is them seeing that yes, you do have experience selling condos on the gold coast or yes, you do have experience working with first time home buyers who want to actually consider a duplex and rent one half of it and kind of house hack their way into their first purchase. That in a simple universe is what they are verifying there. But in reality, in the universe, we actually live in, especially in a day and age where real estate consumers have a lot of choice between who they work with. Many clients are also looking to verify that who they are working with aligns with their personal set of values and must have. Not to borrow, you know, a phrase from from cheesy kind of real estate speak, but what's your list of must have's? There are definitely consumers who have must have's on their list for who they work with that don't include only your real estate experience. And so be mindful of the fact that whatever you share on social media is a component of the verification, the book of verification that your clients will use to determine whether or not you're a good fit for them. Apart from that, I would also encourage folks as you're thinking about the sorts of political messaging that is important enough that you share it with your community is to think about as a professional. What are the things that a donut shop could say online that would cause you to say, you know what, I'm not going to get donuts there anymore. Right. That in itself, just to kind of go through that exercise, to think like one of the things that that that donut shop could say online that would cause me to choose to go somewhere else for my donuts, donuts are a couple of bucks a piece. The threshold there is going to be, or excuse me, the not the threshold, the ramifications, like the much more significant for filters, much more significant when your donuts that you're selling are actually the $10,000, $20,000 commission checks that you might be getting on, say, a luxury property. So think to yourself, like if you're running, if you're considering whether or not this donut shop has crossed the line, you're running your own donut shop here, guys. So don't lose sight of the fact that for better or worse, as real estate professionals, we are not just in sales, we are in community. And if you choose to build a community that only incorporates a certain political view, you are choosing by default who you're not going to include in that community. So be thoughtful about that. Yeah, inclusivity, I think, is an idea that should work for the effectiveness of getting more business. So if we just look at, if I include, if I try not to exclude a certain part of the population, because, and again, it's a personal decision, if you feel strongly, you don't want to work with people with certain beliefs, that's fine. But they're going to do the same thing to you, right? So what you want to do is really be mindful of, yeah, like Chris said, I own a store, even though it's maybe not a true brick and mortar, my business is a store. And do I want to dissuade people from coming in based on a belief about politics that may or may not even be directly related to my business? Yeah, 100%. And like, let's, excuse me, let's gain this out a little bit. If you're a team leader or you are a managing broker and you've got people that work for you, you don't just have customer considerations here. You got people who are also a component of your success by virtue of the business that they bring in that you may alienate one direction or another by choosing to use those platforms that are professional verification tools for personal messaging. So, you know, this kind of actually leads DJ into what I was hoping we could talk a little bit about today. Whenever there are big cultural shifts, like, like the one that happened yesterday, via the presidential election for, you know, in one direction or another, whether you think it's a good or a bad, it's always a good opportunity to do just a quick recap of not the subjective, not like what we believe is whether or not this is good or bad, but to look at the objective signposts that are in the ground right now that are indicating the health direction and hopefully the opportunity in our markets. Great. Well, I want to start by just talking a little bit about a couple of statistics that have dropped in the last week or so. The first one, I want to talk a little bit about young and first time home buyers. The average age for first time home buyers has gone up significantly. We are now pushing 40 years old as the average age for the first time that Americans buy their homes. 38 years old is now the age. This is up significantly even just over a year ago from now. Yeah, last year was at 35. And I remember when I first got into this business well over 10, maybe 14 years ago, I probably saw this 10 years ago was around 31 was the average age. So it is creeping up. Yeah, because it's not creeping up anymore now, it's shooting up. Shooting up. And in fact, the average age of a real estate seller in the United States is over 63. Which is, you know, that's that's kind of a confusing and almost deceptive statistic because it accounts for a lot of different sales. But this age has increased over the last year by five years. It was 58 and now it's 63. And it does kind of lend itself to this overall trend that is really represented by the fact that that now first time home buyers represent less than 25% of sides of real estate transactions in the United States. That's down from 32% in 2023. It's pretty wild. So we're seeing less first time home buyers and we're seeing fewer first time home buyers in the last 12 months and we're seeing the average age of home buyers and sellers raising. That's right. Yeah, that's right. And you know, it's important to think about the conditions that are making this reality. Okay, think about the market conditions. And of course everybody's conditions are a little bit different. This is something important. People are sick of hearing me say this, but I'm going to just keep saying it because there's always going to be someone who's the first time you've heard it real estate is a micro market business. And we make the mistake often of talking about it in macro terms because that's what's easy to to write about in the New York Times, the front pages of the New York Times or on CNBC. We talk about these big national averages. And that's nice for a sound bite. But real estate is a micro market business where what really matters is what's happening on the streets, on the individual blocks of the communities that you serve. But I'm large scale and generally happening in most markets. We have market conditions that are not favorable by any means to first time home buyers. Think about think about what's happening right now. Money is expensive. Mortgage rates, they have come down, but they are still historically high relative to the trends that we've seen in the last five years. Inventory is tight despite the fact that we have seen some loosening, there is still way too few houses relative to the amount of buyers that are actually in the field right now. Right. So we have inventory that is tight. Money is expensive to borrow. So it reduces the buying power of first time home buyers, which is typically a limited amount of buying power to begin with. And because buying power, because of these factors, many of the property owners of existing homes are holding tighter on to their properties because it doesn't make a lot of sense to sell them. What we see now is more and more. I bet you there is every every REALTOR listening to this either knows somebody who is considered or is doing this instead of selling their current property because they've got a mortgage rate that is so favorable. They're going to just keep this bad boy and just try to rent it because they can definitely get more in rent than what they're paying in their mortgage and in their property taxes. If they're going to buy a new place, they're just going to wind up holding that second property and using it as a rental, which might be great for their wealth development, but it is not great at all for the housing market and outlook of people trying to enter the home ownership space. Yeah. So and we also had a couple of years of pretty significant inflation, which also affects people's savings and their ability to save and ability to borrow. So there's a lot of challenges for younger first time home buyers that and we were seeing them sort of it appears rejecting to some degree the idea of home ownership or wanting it and not being able to. It's unclear, you know, is there motivation to buy and is just conditions unfavorable or is it that culturally we're shifting away from home ownership as a sort of, you know, assumed goal for adulthood? That's a great question. And you know, the same study from the National Association of REALTORS has quoted that multi-generational housing purchases are at their all-time high. 17% of residential single-family residential homes that were purchased or sold in the United States in 2023 and the first half of 2024 included some sort of component of multi-generational occupancy, which means we've got an adult child that's living here or maybe grandma and grandpa are going to live with us here. Seven that one in eight that is an insane statistic relative to what the quote-unquote American dream was just thirty or twenty five years ago. And we've seen this play out too. Redfin did a study in February of 2024 around housing affordability as a political concern. 91% of Gen Z respondents to the study cited housing affordability not just as a concern but as absolutely set the alarm bells off for people both from a market perspective but also from an opportunity perspective. We have so many people who are thinking about this and worried about this. That is a prime opportunity for real estate professionals to develop expertise around meeting the needs that are coming from that worry. You will ingratiate yourself into those communities so fast. If you have answers to the questions that that population is asking. That's really interesting and I want to just define Gen Z because I was I had forgotten exactly what the parameters were when we say Gen Z. So Gen Z is a well-justical current ages in 2024. Gen Z goes all the way down to 12 year olds up to 27 year olds. So it's a it's a big swath and these are going to be your future clients. And to your point I think the multi-generational trend that we're seeing inside of you know single family individual homes is is we're starting to see people you know moving back or we've seen people move back or or passing along home from generation to generation. I think that my my my guess is in most markets. If the family if generations have resided in that community. I would think it would be a really really good idea to get in front of as much of the family as possible and really immerse yourself in the community of the family because again there may be some home sharing there may be some home. I mean we we see it here in Chicago all the time. We see families you know have biothree flattened their kids live in one of the units or they have a home and one of the kids is going through a tough time so they move back home. It's it's or the parents are elderly and the kids need to take care of them. This is very very common and what we're I think it's a really interesting play. I was talking to a friend of mine who who was who was with Aria which or sorry Naurap the the the Hispanic national I'm sorry the Hispanic Association of Organ side the Hispanic Hispanic National Association of Hispanic Real Estate Professionals. There you go. Oh my gosh. Oh my gosh. I'm technically I'm Hispanic and I couldn't get that out but or I have a Hispanic name at least but anyway she was saying that this is what REALTORS who are not Hispanic don't understand about Hispanics is that they they make collective decisions here in the US around homes. The whole family is involved in the decision most of the kind and 49 percent of all home buyers last year were Hispanic or first time home buyers rather. So that is an incredible statistic. So we're really talking about community getting involved and understanding sort of that it isn't just you know you know uh the eight 21 year old you know getting married and moving out on their own. Yeah 100 percent. So let's let's talk for a minute about what real estate professionals who are hearing this what you can do to take this information and turn it into an opportunity for yourself in 2025. So that's a couple of things that I think are really important here. The first is and man I'm going to get some crap for this even just in Boston at NAR next week. So if you're listening NAR I'm still excited to come don't cancel me. There is a there is a definitely better than 0 percent chance that there's going to be pretty significant changes to the National Association of REALTORS policy around clear cooperation coming up very soon. I don't have any insider info on this but my gut tells me we're going to have changes to clear cooperation that are going to affect the way that real estate professionals market properties and it will likely give rise to private listing networks that are servicing specific communities. If you are in a housing market where there is a particular a particular gap in the inventory and serviceability of first time home buyers this is a chance to use a shift that might happen on clear cooperation to either develop or to start planning how you can partner with other local professionals around private listing network access that is designed specifically to benefit first time home buyers. And I'm talking about it can be something as basic as a group text chain. I mean that is that is like the the the the most basic iteration and I'm not suggesting you do this right now because it's against clear cooperation and I want you to get in but you can be thinking about how you can benefit the specific underservist and clearly in need portions of your market by virtue of developing the connections that they need in order to stay competitive and ultimately be successful. So that's one thing to think about the other thing I want you to think about is in light of the election season there is a whole new swath of local representatives who hold some very important positions when it comes to determining a lot of stuff including the planning for new construction and housing development. These are folks that have either been freshly reelected and are reinvigorated to continue to represent their communities and make good decisions based on what their communities need or even better for you if you're a real estate agent. They're new to the job and they are looking for wins on how they can create value in their position so that the next time election comes around they have a track record of positive movement to point to. These are folks that you can go to and I have the list I have the list of my locals right here of the new folks who are on the planning commission who are the new drain commissioners who are the new township trustees and representatives. These are folks who I want personal relationships with and if you are a real estate professional there are very few people whose personal relationship is more valuable than the drain commissioner than the person who's head of the planning commission than the person or people who are going to green light the new multi-family housing complex that is proposed to be built on five acres of what was for a long time unused land somewhere. These are your people and if I can if I could point to one thing that would be the most effective for supporting first time home ownership in communities and just generally loosening the grip that this tight inventory has on markets it's new inventory new inventory is not going to come from a whole bunch of people deciding to put their home on their existing home on the market right now that's just not going to happen that won't let rates go down that's not going to happen it's not going to happen I will bet you my list right here I believe you that's just not going to happen if it does that'd be great but I'll eat my hat before that happen me frankly the most effective way is going to be infusing markets with new inventory new inventory gets infused via new construction new construction happens through the gates through the permission gates of these local elected officials you have a whole bunch of people who are brand new and looking to make a good impact and develop a positive image now is the time their phone numbers are public blow them up before your colleagues do because you want to get on their in their good graces before anyone else does yeah and you want to know what their agendas are and what their goals are around housing they can if if they're in alignment with your goals and if you feel that you know their things are headed in the right direction you ask them how can I support you how can I help you create more opportunity in our area and we're probably like you said we're probably talking about development and in development you know it's funny sort of dub tails into a question I get all the time is how do I get to work with developers that sounds really cool I'd like to you know be the exclusive agent on on a new development well these are how these are ways in which you can start to immerse yourself in that community instead of always directly going just to the developers themselves and saying pick me pick me I would with Chris's suggestion which is a wonderful suggestion go to the government uh you know the government affairs people the people that actually you know are do handle permits handle zoning and and get a sense to say hey I'm a REALTOR in my area I want to keep our you know our micro market here thriving and I'd like to know a little bit more about what you know what the goals are of you and what I can do to help you and you know how can I encourage more people to live here or develop property here and that in and of itself is is going to net you some very interesting conversations totally totally and let me let me add one other thing because I know that there were not not the there were definitely more than zero ballot initiatives across major housing markets in the United States this month that included the ability for homeowners to add accessory dwellings onto their single family home with much less restrictions this was something certainly in the Midwest that we saw a fair amount of these these ADUs accessory dwelling units which basically in layman's terms it's like can I put an apartment above my garage this is an actual way to take your existing inventory and turn it into extra housing stock it isn't something you necessarily would sell you're not going to build a condo above your garage of your single family home and then sell just that condo but you would turn it into a rental unit most of these you know in my local market turning these ADUs into rentals requires them to be long-term rentals not short-term rentals and even though that's not necessarily the solution to tight inventory for first time home buyers it does relieve some pressure from the people who are looking to rent and can't find anything to rent and so buying becomes an option for them it does give those folks more options it's just one of these realities that when you have a very tight housing market rental the rental market tends to tighten as well if you can loosen the rental market a little bit the bottom of the housing market tends to loosen just a little bit too it's not going to be enough that it's going to absolutely change the complexion of your local housing market but if you are in a situation like many of us were not even a year or two years ago where first time home buyers were facing competition against 10 to 15-20 different offers even if you could reduce that by 20 percent it would be a meaningful change for a lot of folks and hopefully reduce some of that frustration that they're feeling. Yeah and going just sort of all the way back to the beginning of our conversation talking about how first time home buyers are aging they're getting older and I think my my instinct tells me and again Chris you may need to correct me but my instinct is telling me that there's just not a lot of education around the benefits of home ownership that the average you know 25-year-old may have encountered or learned and I think what what REALTORS can do at this point since we know that you know pricing right now it's it's more difficult to purchase a home I think right now is the time to really start talking to younger people about the benefits of home ownership why it can make sense go through the numbers you know and really start to have those conversations I would be talking to renters all day long right now getting them ready say let's let's create a plan well first of all let's first make the case that home ownership is what you you know what you may want to do if they're on board with that now let's make a plan and once you make a plan then you're you're they're they're person you just follow the plan check in with them I see that as you know I would love to see that first time home buyer of course all of us would that age come down and the only way I think we're going to do that is through education or if rates just drop which they're not going to most likely so I would think education is probably the way to go here yeah I agree completely there is for for better or worse there is a lot of mediocre information on the internet right now about the benefits of home ownership it's not that the the benefits are mediocre literally the information and presentation of that information is mediocre because we are experiencing this influx of artificial intelligence written content that is is just you know it's it's reading these AI plans are reading the content the other AI plans have written and just recycling it recycling it recycling it follow my advice from before and treat this topic as a micro market topic yeah what are the benefits that the buyers in your market could get if they turn from renter to buyer what are the specific benefits that people who live in your community not in my community in your community that they could receive if you can create a compelling case around that particular value proposition you become the advisor the pre-purchase advisor of a ton of different people who are like yeah I'm renting I would love to be a homeowner I'm not ready I don't I don't have the I don't have the resources or the facility or the timeline to do so but maybe in a year from now you're going to get a lot of that I guarantee you most of the seeds that you plant are going to be long nurture seeds but imagine imagine where your business will be if you continue to chug along doing what you're doing right now planting a whole bunch of long nurture seeds and then a year from now when it's time to start harvesting your transaction volume will be up to three four ten x relative to the number of those seeds that you have planted because the reality is in most super tight first time home buyer markets there are a ton of renters because they don't have any other place to go if they want to live there they have to rent I know for me there are there are nearly as many rental units in my local community as there are homes that would even be that would qualify for first time home buyers like in terms of the size and price point that they'd be at so there are a ton of people that are waiting in the wings start nurturing those people by virtue of value propositions that makes sense for them not these generic messages that belong on on PSAs before your local news and I would also add to that team up with other businesses in your local market that are looking for the same consumer that you're looking for right what there's obvious ones that you can think of but there are also restaurants there are clothing shops there are retail establishments that need bodies to come into the store to buy things and if you can say to them hey I want to put more bodies in this neighborhood to come and support your store can we work together on creating some sort of educational movement to get people to want to move to this area or certainly to develop here or at least moving from renting to buying why should they do people should have the information so that they can make the right decision but what typically happens is people just keep renting yeah so truth yeah so I think it's a great place to wrap up it's definitely a strange day in an American history we we've had a bunch of firsts today with the election the 47th election and very unusual day so be mindful out there be be kind be compassionate and let's look for similarities not differences and let's remember this we are in this to to help people with their housing needs and let's just be as be as kind as we can yeah agreed be as kind as you can what a great way to end up be as kind as you can and if you can't be kind just you know just keep your mouth closed that's the easiest way that that's what I would just recommend okay well for all things Chris Chris speaks at all sorts of conferences all over the country he's going to be at the National Association of REALTORS Conference next week please go check out his
