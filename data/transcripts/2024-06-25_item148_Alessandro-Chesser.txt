[00:02:30] Hello and welcome to another episode of keeping it real, the largest podcast
[00:02:34] made by real estate agents and for real estate agents.
[00:02:37] My name is DJ Paris.
[00:02:38] I'm your guide and host through the show.
[00:02:40] And I'm really excited about today.
[00:02:42] In just a moment, I'm going to be speaking with Alessandro Chester from get
[00:02:45] dynastie.com.
[00:02:46] And we're going to talk all about why real estate needs to be in trusts and
[00:02:52] why all of your clients should be doing this and how easy it is to do.
[00:02:56] And we're going to walk you through step by step how to do this.
[00:02:58] This was a brand new piece of information for me.
[00:03:01] I actually didn't know this.
[00:03:03] So I'm hopeful that you guys don't know this either.
[00:03:06] Please let us know if this is like the kind of information that's really
[00:03:09] helpful because I believe this will separate you from all the other agents
[00:03:13] in your area after listening to it.
[00:03:15] So let's just get right to it.
[00:03:16] Before we do, though, please remember to support our sponsors.
[00:03:20] Check out their products and services.
[00:03:22] Also send this episode to one other agent that you know, especially this one.
[00:03:27] I really think most agents do not understand this.
[00:03:30] I didn't.
[00:03:31] So please send it over to them that will help us out a lot.
[00:03:34] But guys, let's get to it.
[00:03:35] My conversation with Alessandro Chester.
[00:03:51] Today on the show, my guest is Alessandro Chester from Git Dynasty.
[00:03:57] Now, Alexander Chester is the co founder and CEO of Git Dynasty.com,
[00:04:01] which is a free and easy living trust creation system.
[00:04:05] Now Git Dynasty's mission is to make it easy for homeowners to put their home
[00:04:10] in a trust.
[00:04:10] Now, prior to starting Git Dynasty, Alessandro was the VP of sales at Carta,
[00:04:16] which was last valued at $8 billion.
[00:04:19] He spent eight years there helping take the company from zero to over 300 million
[00:04:23] in annual revenue.
[00:04:25] He, please to learn more about Git Dynasty.
[00:04:28] And we're really excited to have Alessandro on today because we believe this is
[00:04:32] something that most real estate agents aren't that familiar with.
[00:04:36] And this is a way for you to differentiate yourself from the competition
[00:04:39] and provide incredible value to your clients.
[00:04:43] So I want everybody to visit Git Dynasty.com.
[00:04:46] We will have a link to that in the show notes.
[00:04:48] You can also follow them on all the social channels.
[00:04:50] Just search for Git Dynasty.
[00:04:51] We'll also have links to their social channels as well.
[00:04:54] Alessandro, welcome to the show.
[00:04:56] Thanks for having me.
[00:04:58] By the way, I have two cats.
[00:05:00] Most people are listening, so this doesn't apply to them.
[00:05:02] So forgive me for a moment.
[00:05:04] But if you are watching, you'll see there's two.
[00:05:06] A brother and sister cat that do everything together.
[00:05:09] And I'm working from home today and they might be walking behind me.
[00:05:12] So I apologize if that's distracting anyone or click the
[00:05:15] Alessandro.
[00:05:15] Sorry about that.
[00:05:16] Love it.
[00:05:17] Yeah.
[00:05:18] Yeah, they're still kittens technically.
[00:05:20] So they do pretty silly things.
[00:05:22] But let's get to you and get Dynasty.
[00:05:25] So this is again, a bit of a departure episode for us.
[00:05:28] We traditionally talk to top REALTORS in the country and say,
[00:05:32] Hey, how'd you do that?
[00:05:33] And which is great.
[00:05:34] And we've done, gosh, 600 plus episodes there.
[00:05:37] But I love what I get to talk to people like you who are really
[00:05:40] bringing something new to the table that REALTORS can learn from.
[00:05:44] And again, provide value to their clients.
[00:05:46] So let's start at the very beginning is just how did you get into the
[00:05:50] living trust business like tell us start us all the way back in your career?
[00:05:55] Yeah, so this actually takes me all the way back to the very beginning.
[00:05:58] My very first job at 16 years old and I can literally say everything I've done in my career has led me to this point.
[00:06:04] I mean, like it's the honest truth of my very first job at 16 years old when I was still in high school.
[00:06:09] Was that bank of America in the retail bank?
[00:06:13] It was just part time job and I started off as a teller, but I quickly moved over to the sales side of the retail bank.
[00:06:22] So whenever you know back then, I don't retail banks don't really exist very much anymore.
[00:06:26] But back then you'd walk into a bank and on one side you had the cash handling tellers.
[00:06:31] So on the other side you have the people sitting at the desk. That's what I did. I sat at the desk.
[00:06:35] And you know, I worked with individuals and helped them do mortgages and business accounts and business loans and I referred them over to the investment team.
[00:06:45] And so during that time, I actually was heavily trained in what trust in what living trust are and work.
[00:06:54] I was trained to look through the documents and to know the differences between a revocable trust and errorable trust.
[00:07:00] And your customers would want to retitle their accounts. And so we had to look through the documents and we had to make sure it reflected correctly on the accounts.
[00:07:07] On the opposite side of it when customers, you know, somebody would pass away, they would come in with the trust documents.
[00:07:13] And so I was very familiar with them already just from my close to eight years in financial services.
[00:07:19] And actually, I did Bank of America, I did Union Bank. I ended up at Washington Mutual. I was selling loans during the right leading up to the mortgage crisis, which was a very interesting time period.
[00:07:31] And so I really deep exposure into high net worth individuals and trust specifically.
[00:07:37] Fast forwarding to the kind of a second half of my career, I spent the last decade working for Silicon Valley technology companies.
[00:07:46] It was just a factor of me being born and raised in Silicon Valley. A bunch of my friends worked for, you know, their parents worked for startup companies growing up.
[00:07:55] I always knew I wanted to get into startups. But I didn't think, you know, I kind of had more of a sales background.
[00:08:01] And so I, you know, took me a while to land my first job. But once I did, it led me to joining this company, Carter, in 2014, as the first sales rep.
[00:08:12] Carter, you know, what we did was we digitized legal documents for startup companies and startup investors.
[00:08:19] So before Carter existed, you know, an investor would invest in a startup company like, you know, think about, you know, these companies that are private right now, like Stripe is a private company, you know, used to be like Airbnb and Uber.
[00:08:32] When investors used to invest in these companies, they actually would get a paper stock certificate. That was their proof of ownership.
[00:08:38] Similar to what used to exist in the public markets like 30 years ago, but in the public stock market, everything has been digitized now.
[00:08:47] And so on the private markets, it was just, it was a couple of decades behind. And so that's what we did at Carter. We sucked up all the paper, all the employee option grants, all the investor stocks certificates, and we created the registrar for private securities.
[00:09:00] And really the foundation of the company was just digitizing legal documents. And so during my time at Carter, you know, I went from, you know, company went from 10 employees to 2000 employees from zero revenue to over 300 million in annual revenue.
[00:09:15] And I kind of scaled with the company and I owned sales.
[00:09:19] At one point, I had 200 people reporting to me, a team that I built, brick by brick, you know, hired. And so I got really good experience like building out a software revenue business.
[00:09:33] And really good experience working with the product managers and the engineers. And so that led me to the point of, you know, eventually being able to have the opportunity to start my own company because I became really good friends with the Carter investors.
[00:09:46] And I became really good friends with the original engineer at Carter and the original product manager. And so we knew we wanted to start a company together. We didn't really know what to do. We were going back and forth on different ideas.
[00:09:58] And this idea was actually one that another friend of mine presented to me and he's like, you should digitize trust documents. And it was like a live bulb went off immediately because I already knew the challenges with trust documents. I already know that 95% of Americans don't have trust. Everybody should have one.
[00:10:13] Me personally, you know, I at that point I was married. I have a couple of kids. I was lucky enough to be able to take advantage of a couple of different liquidity transactions. When I worked at Carter, I was able to sell some of my stock.
[00:10:26] I had a nest egg. I had all the reasons to create a trust by still the, and I knew that trust from Port, but I still didn't have one.
[00:10:33] And so it was just a live bulb went off right away. And I knew this was this was something that we needed to fix and same exact playbook. We need digitize it. We need to make it simple and accessible for everybody. And that's how we keep the company off.
[00:10:46] Yeah, I'll tell us more about what gets get dynasty does.
[00:10:50] Yeah, so we are the easiest way for homeowners to put their home on its rest. And so we really narrowed it on homeowners. Very, very important because, you know, I think when you're building a startup company, you want to be, you want to get as focused as you can get the more specific in what your description of what you do the better.
[00:11:09] It's going to describe your strategy for product is going to help inform your partnership strategies.
[00:11:17] And so we knew we wanted to digitize trust, but we took us some time to figure out a very specific point to get into our customers and that's home ownership.
[00:11:27] And the reason why we focus on homeownership is because for most Americans, for most American adults, their home is their most important as their biggest asset.
[00:11:36] And it's a really wide market. There's 80 million homeowners in the United States. And if you look at the data, it's all public is real estate records are public. You can look and see who owns what properties.
[00:11:47] 90 to 95% of homes are not held in a trust or an LLC for that matter. They're just held in personal name. And so that's a huge issue. The richest Americans put their homes in a trust. And so those homes when they die or they become incapacitated, they don't have to go through probacore.
[00:12:07] They can go straight to their children. But for the 90 to 95% of Americans that don't have their home in a trust, if something happens to them, their home is going to get seized by the state government forced into probacore.
[00:12:20] And it's going to take their family on average 18 months to get access to the home and to be able to sell it and take the proceeds.
[00:12:30] And more importantly, this probacore is super expensive. You know, you need lawyers, there's court fees. And it creates a lot of family disputes. It actually grips families apart because the children end up going in and probating.
[00:12:44] They argue, you know, I was supposed to get this much. Even if you have a will, people think that that's what Americans think they need to have is everybody should have a will.
[00:12:52] Now, wills have to be processed through probacore. They still have to go through that 18 one process that costs tens of thousands of dollars if not more depending on the challenges.
[00:13:02] Trust are the only way to avoid probacore. Literally hundreds of billions of dollars a year gets forced into probacore because most Americans don't have their home in a trust.
[00:13:13] And so we want to that's what we want to do. We want to make it simple and easy and we have a free product. Anybody can create a free trust from their cell phone in less than five minutes.
[00:13:21] And you know, we think if you're in the market to buy a new home or you have a home, you should absolutely be putting it into a trust.
[00:13:28] So yeah, let's talk about the benefits of a trust or rather actually, let me rephrase that.
[00:13:33] Let's start with what happens. We talked about, you know, if you pass away, even if you have a will, you're still going through probacore, you're still dealing with that legal process to, you know, distribute your assets as according to your well.
[00:13:45] A lot of Americans don't even have wills, which is a whole nother issue. But let's talk about what does a trust do that a will sort of does it.
[00:13:54] Yeah, so the most important things are going to be privacy control and protection. And so privacy, when you're on your home, you know, if you have a will, you, you own your home that my home is owned by a Los Angeles road chester.
[00:14:10] And because real estate records are public, it's a very simple search. You can just search your records. You can see exactly where I live. Here's my address.
[00:14:16] But also somebody were to walk in front of my house and slip and fall. They can just do a quick search on my address. They can see that I own it and they can sue me directly.
[00:14:25] Right. They could look up your name. They could see that you were part of Carter that's now an $800 billion company.
[00:14:31] This guy might have some deep pockets.
[00:14:33] Yep. Yep. And so, but if I create a trust, I can call my trust whatever I'm wrong. I call it XYZ trust. I can call it the DJ Paris trust. Right.
[00:14:42] I can like literally deter people. And so that when somebody were to look up who owns my home, now they're going to see this trust name, this random trust name.
[00:14:51] And it's a deterrent because they don't know who owns that. They're going to have to, you know, they have to get court order to pierce the trust and figure out who owns it.
[00:14:59] So privacy is a huge reason to have trust, especially if you own real estate.
[00:15:03] The second reason is control. You know, it's direct control. You create the instructions for who's going to inherit your home when you pass away or you become incapacitated.
[00:15:12] If you have a will, you're creating those instructions, but they have to be processed by a judge. And the other day the judge is to get keeper of what happens.
[00:15:19] And oftentimes, you know, people will challenge the will and say, oh, it's unfair. This and that. And, you know, it may not always end up the way that you intended it to go as far as your distribution of your inheritance.
[00:15:31] Versus if you have a trust, it never sees a light of day unless it gets challenged. But if it doesn't get challenged, you know, your what happens is when you die or you becoming incapacitated, your successor takes over the trust and distributes the inheritance according to your wishes.
[00:15:47] And so it doesn't it doesn't go through the pro-bake court system.
[00:15:49] So control is a very big part and protection as well, you know, it's protection mainly from pro-bake court, but also potentially from lawsuits because it services is deterrent because it's harder for people to actually see who owns the property.
[00:16:02] And so it gives you some level of protection from things like lawsuits, which is different than, you know, there's also asset protection trust specifically that will give you even more protection from lawsuits and creditors and divorce and whatnot. But that's a whole different category.
[00:16:18] Is there any reason that a homeowner shouldn't have a trust? Is this applied to every homeowner or are there reasons to maybe consider not doing that?
[00:16:29] Yeah, and so this is a very simple thing to do. Like if you just go to Google and you say like, well, why should somebody not put their home in a trust or, you know, I actually use like the AI, the chat GPT.
[00:16:39] Why should what's the reason not to have the number one the only reason is because it cost that's it.
[00:16:44] And so that's what our platform does. We've removed the cost completely because traditionally you got to go see a lawyer and cost thousands of dollars.
[00:16:52] How do you keep it updated? It's going to cost you more money. It's like friction. They're like for most people, you don't need one.
[00:16:57] Well, that's wrong. If you completely removed costs because we've automated, we've made a digital, we've made it simple. Then there's no excuses. There's zero downside.
[00:17:04] It does not impact your taxes in any way, shape or form. You're going to file your taxes exactly what you've been filing it. All it does is give you the benefits that I just mentioned and that's it.
[00:17:15] That's yeah, that's it's really interesting. I am.
[00:17:19] I love that. So on get dynasty. I know there's there's two different tiers, right? You have the free tier, which allows you to create the trust.
[00:17:27] And then there's a paid tier. Let's talk about those differences and I just love that you can create a trust for free, which is insane.
[00:17:35] And then there's sort of an ongoing care tier that allows you to make changes and edit. So tell us sort of a more about what that is and what those differences are.
[00:17:44] Yeah, so the free tier anybody wants to just create like a starter trust like it's very simple. It has limited functions. You can't make it once you create it can't make any changes to it.
[00:17:55] It's kind of a simple one and done trust.
[00:17:57] Later if you want to make any updates, if you want to add a complexity to it, if you want to talk to customer support person, you want to, you know, you have questions about it. That's all part of our upgraded package for $99 a year.
[00:18:09] And so that's customers usually start with the free and then they upgrade into the paid when they want to start using it more and talk to people.
[00:18:16] And they may want to get it notarized. We have a remote notary baked into the paid plan as well.
[00:18:21] And so, you know, I think most people generally start with the free. Like if you're if you're going to have anything like having no trust is a huge problem.
[00:18:29] Like if you're like a free trust is 100% better than no trust.
[00:18:34] Yeah, no, I love that. And this is something that REALTORS are notoriously not skilled or just ignorant to all right. They just don't have this information.
[00:18:45] They'll think, oh, talk to the estate planning attorney.
[00:18:48] You know, they'll they'll help you figure out your will and your trust and maybe possibly.
[00:18:55] But this is something that you as a real estate agent can actually bring to them and say, hey, have you considered a living trust.
[00:19:01] The answer will be no for your home. They hadn't thought about that. And so, okay, great. Let's talk about that.
[00:19:07] And do you, you know, do you run into any resistance from a state planning attorneys because, of course, I would assuming they charge for living trust.
[00:19:16] So how does that sort of typically play out where you're offering this, you know, free service.
[00:19:20] And does that, you know, how does that work with the state planning attorneys?
[00:19:24] I mean, we're definitely competitive, right. But, you know, we actually have a lot of estate planning attorney partners.
[00:19:30] And I think it's pretty clear. Like the person who's going to go spend $3,000 to create a trust is going to go spend $3,000 to create trust.
[00:19:39] They're going to want them are full service experience.
[00:19:42] Our customers are the people that, you know, they might be a little bit younger. They don't have as much urgency to do it.
[00:19:48] Maybe they haven't had kids yet. Maybe they haven't been married yet.
[00:19:52] And so they don't have as much reasons to do it. The biggest reason is because it's free and it takes you less than five minutes.
[00:19:57] And if you don't do it now, when you're buying a house, you're probably never going to do it.
[00:20:01] Because it's really hard to transfer title into the trust, right. And so that's why we are partnering specifically with real estate agents and mortgage lenders.
[00:20:11] And title companies. Because we think as part of the home buying process, that's the most, it's where you can add tremendous value.
[00:20:21] Because that's when it's actually going to be free and easy. Because like they can create the trust with us in less than five minutes.
[00:20:26] And then when they close on the home, they just tell the mortgage company, hey, put it in my home.
[00:20:29] And mortgage company, tile company, they coordinate and close this straight into the home.
[00:20:33] There's no extra work that has to be done. Besides setting it up in less than five minutes on their phone.
[00:20:39] That's the best time to do it. Because if you don't do it then, and you wait, then you're going to need to try, you know, you've got to create your trust.
[00:20:47] You can do it. That's for free. But you're going to need to transfer title. And that's not free.
[00:20:51] Like if you want us to help you do that, you need to upgrade. Or if you go do that with the lawyer, they're going to want to charge you, you know, at least five hundred dollars, maybe fifteen hundred dollars.
[00:21:01] And it takes time. That, and if you try to do it yourself, you're probably never going to be able to figure it out.
[00:21:05] Like I consider myself to be a pretty savvy person. And I try to transfer my own title in the county, declined me three times in a row.
[00:21:13] And I talked, I called the county recorder. I said, I don't understand. I got the template off the internet because they won't provide the templates for deeds.
[00:21:20] So like why, what's the issue here? And they told me they could not help me. I had to see the turn.
[00:21:24] I was like, what? I was like, why can I walk into my bank and tell them I want to transfer my account to my trust and they just do it.
[00:21:31] Why can't I do that with county with my home? And they're like, it's illegal. It's a legal thing.
[00:21:36] So that's when we really honed in on this home buying process. That's when it makes the most sense. It's the simplest. That's when real estate agents can add a ton of value.
[00:21:46] Because you tell all you have to do is say, do you want to put your home in a trust? Like you're buying home. Are you planning to put in a trust?
[00:21:54] Naturally, the customer is going to say, should I? Well, like there's no reason not to. It just gives you privacy and protection control.
[00:22:00] If you want to know why go to this website, they'll show you they have a free way to do it.
[00:22:05] Every home should be in trust. We very strongly believe that. And so the only time that it's actually going to be free easy is if you took before you buy them.
[00:22:16] If you do it after, then it's going to be a little bit more complicated. Even though we still offer that product, then you're going to have to pay us money for us to help you with that.
[00:22:22] Sure. What does it cost on average? Once a home is closed and maybe it's five years later and then the person goes, I do want to put it in a trust.
[00:22:31] Just not a curiosity. Just ballpark what might they be looking at cost wise?
[00:22:36] Yeah. So you have two different options to create the trust. You can either go to attorney or you can go to one of these online trust creators, which is our main competitors.
[00:22:44] The online, you know, legal zooms, rocket lawyers and the world. The online trust creators, they're going to charge you on average like 500 dollars to create the trust.
[00:22:51] They don't help you transfer title. The little referral you to somebody else, you know, you'll try to get it done that they might charge you another a few hundred dollars. So maybe a thousand bucks, you can get it done.
[00:23:02] But a lot of that working to have to do yourself. It's a pain. Most customers don't finish it. Most online trust that are created. People don't end up transferring title.
[00:23:10] And like if you're not going to put your home in your trust, like you just wasted your money creating the trust for most Americans.
[00:23:15] And like that's your biggest asset and like you didn't even put in the trust. Like your trust is not doing very much.
[00:23:20] The alternative is you go see attorney. And the attorney is going to charge you the full package. They're going to create your trust. They're going to add on all these other things that you may not desperately need immediately like a health directive of power of attorney will all these other things.
[00:23:34] You know, I call it the equivalent of going to you know McDonald's in game the number three supersize are going to add on all these extra options are going to make sure they charge you 25 hundred dollars basically.
[00:23:44] Yeah. And not only that, but it's a pretty extensive process like and they're going to ask you all kinds of you know they want to make sure they justify that 25 hundred dollar charge.
[00:23:53] Sure. So they're going to ask they're going to give you so much complexity that you that honestly for most people all they need is who's going to inherit my home if something happens to me. That's it.
[00:24:03] That's a simple is that that's what that's what you do when you set up a trust who owns the trust and who does it go to later like that knows what the most important things does.
[00:24:13] So going back to the I'm in the process of buying a home and this is sort of the best time to consider putting it in a trust at least it's the most cost effective way and the least complicated way does it impact a homeowner or soon to be homeowners ability to borrow does it affect their mortgage is anything in that sense where now the lender looks at it a little differently.
[00:24:37] Yeah, so it's really interesting we're actually partnered with a really big top three lender and they were very eager to work with us and they know it's a huge value and one of the first questions I asked them was because I remember back in the day.
[00:24:51] You know they used to tell you okay if you're going to buy a home and you want to put in a trust just like put it in your name first and then move it to the trust after.
[00:24:58] And because mortgage company didn't want to you know didn't want it to go straight into trust and so I asked this mortgage partner of ours is big lender why are mortgage companies why do they shy away from letting people put in a trust and the response was because it's changing now it more lenders are becoming open to it.
[00:25:17] But the biggest reason why is because the lenders are lazy and they didn't want to actually they didn't want to actually look at the trust documents to make sure that it's a revulcable because revulcable trust or what you can if you have a that's what we do revulcable trust if it's a revulcable trust and it can go in your home your mortgage everything there's no issues at all it's actually a lot the garden same germane act like nobody can stop you from putting your home with the mortgage into a revulcable trust nobody can stop you from doing that if lenders try to turn you down it's because you're lazy and they don't want to look at the trust.
[00:25:47] So you don't want to ask for a trust document to make sure that it's a revulcable trust well we're solving that problem with these big partners that we're working with on the lending side because they just review our trust documents once and make sure they're good and then any customers they send to us are they don't even have to look at any more there are hundred percent of truth.
[00:26:03] So you know mortgage lenders if they give you a hard time about putting your home in a trust like you push back and there's no reason for them to do that you know any you're your home you can go in a trust by law by law home with the mortgage company.
[00:26:17] can go into a revulcable trust.
[00:26:20] Specifically, the irrevocables are different.
[00:26:22] Irrovulc, and we offer that product as well,
[00:26:23] but that's not for homeowners.
[00:26:25] Irrovulcable trust is where you're giving the asset away now.
[00:26:30] So instead of waiting with a revulcable trust,
[00:26:32] the asset will pass to your children when you die.
[00:26:35] With an irrevocable trust, you're basically saying,
[00:26:38] here's my money, I'm putting it in the revulcable trust,
[00:26:41] and I'm giving it to my children now.
[00:26:43] So I don't know any more.
[00:26:45] And of course, you can't do that with a mortgage on it.
[00:26:48] Of course, you can't give away a home
[00:26:50] that you don't completely own.
[00:26:52] Sure.
[00:26:52] So for mortgages, as long as it's a revulcable trust,
[00:26:57] which is what 99% of people create,
[00:26:58] that's our product, that's our free product,
[00:27:00] and our $99 your product.
[00:27:03] Everybody will let you put your home
[00:27:06] into every vocal trust.
[00:27:08] Yeah, get Dynasty.com is where you can go and set up
[00:27:11] your own living trust for your own property,
[00:27:13] for your own properties, if you're an investor, of course,
[00:27:16] as well as to make sure you tell all of your clients about this.
[00:27:21] And I was thinking, I'm just putting my marketing hat on,
[00:27:25] you know, I know it's fun to give a closing gift
[00:27:27] when a property closes, of course,
[00:27:29] so a REALTOR to a client.
[00:27:31] And yes, those are cool and fun.
[00:27:33] But a lot of times, if we think about the gift suite,
[00:27:35] we give how useful are they?
[00:27:37] Are they being utilized?
[00:27:39] Maybe, but if you're looking for a new idea,
[00:27:43] this is a pretty useful idea.
[00:27:45] Maybe you pay for the first year,
[00:27:47] if you want to give them that option,
[00:27:49] or sort of give them the upgraded version for the first,
[00:27:52] maybe you pay for three years,
[00:27:53] and then you just somehow figure out a way to do that.
[00:27:56] But I see some sort of way where an agent could bring that
[00:28:00] and say, hey, I want to help you,
[00:28:02] really get a good service here,
[00:28:04] and make sure if you have any questions about this trust
[00:28:06] along the way that they're going to be able to assist you
[00:28:08] and it's 99 bucks a year, it's not a big deal.
[00:28:10] This is something,
[00:28:11] and then if you want to continue on,
[00:28:13] you can continue on after that.
[00:28:14] Have you seen any REALTOR's starting to do that,
[00:28:16] like offering this as a, hey, closing gift,
[00:28:19] or just, I offer this as part of my service, things like that?
[00:28:21] That's really interesting.
[00:28:23] So we haven't done that yet with REALTOR's,
[00:28:25] but financial advisors do that all day with us.
[00:28:28] And they specifically pay for their clients
[00:28:30] in the upgraded package,
[00:28:32] because they, number one, it's a really unique thing
[00:28:35] to do for your client.
[00:28:37] But number two, because they're paying for their trust,
[00:28:39] it creates a stickier relationship with the advisor.
[00:28:42] It's like now, send, if they, you know,
[00:28:44] they keep having that reminder every time they use it,
[00:28:47] they're like my financial advisor is paying for this.
[00:28:51] So if they unwind that relationship with the financial advisor,
[00:28:54] they have to unwind that trust.
[00:28:56] It's just more complicated,
[00:28:58] more friction to stop using them.
[00:29:00] And I think with real estate age,
[00:29:01] I don't know what the date is,
[00:29:03] but I would love to know, like,
[00:29:04] people at buy houses like, on average,
[00:29:07] how many years before they sell that house and buy another one?
[00:29:10] You really like seven, like seven, I think?
[00:29:12] Yeah. And so like, you want to maintain
[00:29:14] that relationship with that.
[00:29:15] 100%
[00:29:17] And so then it's also a way to reengage with old clients.
[00:29:19] Like we have loan officers that are doing that.
[00:29:22] They're like, hey, like all, you know,
[00:29:24] here's a free option or here's a paid option.
[00:29:26] Like we want to, you know, keep that relationship going
[00:29:29] and re-engaging.
[00:29:31] It's a way to add, re-engage them and add value,
[00:29:34] which may open up the next opportunity for you.
[00:29:37] Yeah, I see also an opportunity for education here.
[00:29:40] So REALTORS, oftentimes, will do seminars or webinars,
[00:29:44] things like, you know, so you want to buy a condo
[00:29:47] or you want to buy your first home or,
[00:29:48] or, you know, investment property, sort of 101,
[00:29:51] or whatever topics that your, you know,
[00:29:54] your sphere of influence are interested in.
[00:29:56] This is a great topic that no one else is doing.
[00:29:59] If you're doing, you know, you know,
[00:30:01] becoming going from renter to buyer,
[00:30:02] yes, that's great, but that's being done
[00:30:04] in your local market a lot.
[00:30:06] You know, people do those.
[00:30:07] That's not super unique.
[00:30:09] It's a good one, but it's not unique.
[00:30:11] This is a unique one.
[00:30:12] And this is, you know, I would even call it something
[00:30:15] like why every single homeowner needs to have a trust
[00:30:18] or something to that effect.
[00:30:19] And, you know, because if it's every single homeowner
[00:30:22] that applies to literally everybody who owns a property
[00:30:24] and this now becomes something that appeals
[00:30:27] to a much wider audience than having this narrow focus.
[00:30:30] There's very few things in life or in business
[00:30:32] that apply to kind of everybody.
[00:30:35] This is kind of one of those unique opportunities
[00:30:37] to kind of get ahead of the curve.
[00:30:39] And Alessandro is bringing this product
[00:30:41] to like the market for free.
[00:30:43] He's basically, he's doing kind of a version
[00:30:45] in a way of what Zillow did,
[00:30:47] is bringing something that used to be behind lock and key
[00:30:49] and cost a lot of money to the public.
[00:30:52] And, you know, he's got some subscription options.
[00:30:55] So if you want to, you know, increase your level of service
[00:30:57] and support, you can do that.
[00:30:58] But he's basically bringing you something
[00:31:00] that used to be really in the shadows
[00:31:02] and only understood by estate planning attorneys
[00:31:05] and maybe financial advisors and accountants possibly.
[00:31:08] But really, you know, it's funny.
[00:31:10] I'll tell a quick story.
[00:31:11] I know that and REALTORS too,
[00:31:14] I want you to think about your own property
[00:31:16] and your own business because, you know,
[00:31:18] this really also is a great reminder
[00:31:20] that if you are a REALTOR listening
[00:31:22] which you probably are, consider talking to your accountant
[00:31:25] about forming a corporation,
[00:31:29] whether it's a seat corporation and S corporation,
[00:31:32] there are true benefits, tax benefits to doing so.
[00:31:35] There's different benefits for different types of structures.
[00:31:38] But I just went through this myself.
[00:31:40] I went to buy a car.
[00:31:41] This is how ignorant I am.
[00:31:44] And I went to buy a car recently,
[00:31:46] a couple of weeks ago and bought a car forever.
[00:31:48] And I was just signing all the paper
[00:31:50] just ready to walk out with my new car.
[00:31:52] And I said, maybe I should buy this in my company name
[00:31:55] like it just occurred to me on the way out the door.
[00:31:59] Thankfully I hadn't signed everything yet.
[00:32:01] And so I got on the, I was like, it's not dumb, I am.
[00:32:03] I'm like, I probably should ask my accountant.
[00:32:05] So I asked her, shut her message,
[00:32:07] should I buy this in my company name?
[00:32:08] Cause I don't know.
[00:32:09] And cause I've looked it up before
[00:32:11] and it was confusing like sort of sometimes,
[00:32:12] but maybe not always.
[00:32:14] And she was like, absolutely no brainer.
[00:32:16] And so this is just one of those things that like,
[00:32:19] I'm embarrassed.
[00:32:20] I actually, and I'm not saying this to humble brag
[00:32:22] because these are all small companies.
[00:32:24] But I have like four small companies.
[00:32:26] You would think that I would know that this is a good idea.
[00:32:29] And I did not.
[00:32:30] So thankfully my accountant was good and was like,
[00:32:33] yes, do it this way.
[00:32:34] And this way and we got it done.
[00:32:35] And it was, it was easy peasy.
[00:32:37] And there's some true benefit to doing that.
[00:32:39] So you know, for everyone listening,
[00:32:40] yes, this is a great opportunity for your clients.
[00:32:42] Start with yourself because you want to talk about,
[00:32:45] I did this for me.
[00:32:46] I went on their website.
[00:32:47] I did it for free.
[00:32:48] It took five minutes.
[00:32:49] And here's what it does to protect my home.
[00:32:52] And here's how it protects my estate.
[00:32:55] And you know, use that as your sort of, you know,
[00:32:58] North stars like, no, I do this for me.
[00:33:00] And here's why I can tell everybody else to do it.
[00:33:03] So I see this as a webinar play.
[00:33:06] I see this as of course talking with every client
[00:33:08] you have individually.
[00:33:09] But I see this as I see YouTube or Facebook shorts,
[00:33:12] Instagram shorts, YouTube shorts.
[00:33:14] I see you going to saying, hey, I've got this cool thing
[00:33:16] that you probably haven't thought of.
[00:33:18] And this applies to everyone reach out to me
[00:33:20] and we can talk more about it, right?
[00:33:21] Things like that.
[00:33:22] I see this as a lead generation tool quite frankly.
[00:33:25] As in addition to a huge value add to the clients,
[00:33:28] I see this as an attractor because you're basically
[00:33:30] providing something that I, I mean,
[00:33:33] attorneys aren't notoriously great
[00:33:35] lesser in personal injury are not, you know,
[00:33:37] really great at marketing or advertising,
[00:33:39] you know, the personal injury guys are,
[00:33:41] you see them on billboards.
[00:33:42] We don't usually see a lot of estate planning people
[00:33:44] sort of out there.
[00:33:45] So you have to seek those people out and that's why
[00:33:48] a lot of people don't have wills
[00:33:50] because we don't see a lot of messaging that's like,
[00:33:52] or trust like, hey, you should probably consider doing this.
[00:33:56] If you look for it, you can find it,
[00:33:57] but who looks for it?
[00:33:58] It's like insurance.
[00:33:59] Like you sort of have to have somebody
[00:34:01] bugging you a little bit going, hey,
[00:34:02] we need to look at your insurance.
[00:34:04] You need to have insurance, you know,
[00:34:05] and so this is one of those,
[00:34:06] this is one of those unique sort of products
[00:34:08] that really fits everybody.
[00:34:11] And yet no one's really servicing this particular market
[00:34:15] and REALTORS can kind of step in
[00:34:17] and be that proactive guide to those clients
[00:34:20] and start with yourself.
[00:34:21] I'm gonna do this for myself.
[00:34:22] Now it's gonna cost me because I've already bought my home,
[00:34:25] but there's some, look, I have businesses.
[00:34:27] There's probably a good reason for me to protect this condo.
[00:34:32] And so I will look into doing that
[00:34:34] and I'll shame on me for not doing it ahead of time.
[00:34:36] I'll have to pay extra.
[00:34:37] Don't make this the same thing for you
[00:34:39] or your clients.
[00:34:41] Make this something that you enter into your business.
[00:34:44] This is a differentiator in my mind.
[00:34:45] So I'll send her, I think this is great.
[00:34:49] I wanna wrap up here because I think we got to the point.
[00:34:52] We told everybody what they need to do.
[00:34:53] Guys, get Dynasty.com is where you go.
[00:34:56] You can set up your own living trust there in five,
[00:34:59] 10 minutes.
[00:35:00] It's good, it's legal, it's valid.
[00:35:03] And if you want to upgrade,
[00:35:04] and I would absolutely encourage you to upgrade,
[00:35:07] at least for the first year or two,
[00:35:09] just in case anything goes wrong
[00:35:10] and you need that customer support.
[00:35:12] Guys, it's $99 a year, not a big deal, right?
[00:35:14] We can all afford this.
[00:35:15] And consider this as part of your closing gift package
[00:35:19] to your clients.
[00:35:20] On the buy side for sure, right?
[00:35:23] And even on the sell side, you can say,
[00:35:24] hey, when you buy your next home,
[00:35:27] we're going to, you know, assuming they're not buying one
[00:35:29] at that time, we're selling this home.
[00:35:31] Next time, we're putting this next one in a trust.
[00:35:33] It was kind of like, you know,
[00:35:35] this is kind of a morbid thing to say.
[00:35:37] And I apologize for it, but it's a good analogy.
[00:35:40] I went, I was married once, many, many years ago,
[00:35:43] and the marriage didn't work out like
[00:35:45] over half of the marriages in this country did.
[00:35:47] And I remember my divorce attorney who, on the way out,
[00:35:51] who's a lovely woman, she goes,
[00:35:52] if you ever get married again, you are getting a,
[00:35:55] and that's an, I'm not like a wealthy guy,
[00:35:57] but she goes, you're getting a prenup
[00:35:58] and I was like, I have like nothing at the time.
[00:35:59] I had no money.
[00:36:00] She goes, you're still getting a prenup.
[00:36:03] And, and, and, and by the way,
[00:36:04] backslip is amazing and we didn't have any issues
[00:36:06] in the divorce, but even that being amicable,
[00:36:09] she was like, you have to get a prenup next time.
[00:36:11] I was like, oh, I do.
[00:36:12] She goes, yes.
[00:36:13] And so this is kind of one of those situations,
[00:36:15] similar to that where you don't want your client
[00:36:18] to find out that they should have done this.
[00:36:20] So this is an opportunity, you know,
[00:36:22] yeah, maybe go back to your previous clients
[00:36:23] who do own homes, ask them to consider doing it,
[00:36:26] but yes, they're gonna pay a bit for that.
[00:36:28] But certainly, for anyone buying a home,
[00:36:30] this is where you can provide an incredible amount of value.
[00:36:33] It doesn't delay the closing process.
[00:36:34] It doesn't affect the lender relationship
[00:36:37] or the opportunity to get a mortgage.
[00:36:39] It's just a way to protect the asset and protect privacy, right?
[00:36:43] So we know that real estate records have to be public.
[00:36:47] They have to.
[00:36:48] Our whole democratic system is built upon the ability
[00:36:51] to get information.
[00:36:51] We have to know who owns property.
[00:36:53] And this is a way to, to make that a little bit harder
[00:36:57] to find and to literally protect it.
[00:37:00] So that people can't look up and, and, and see that, you know,
[00:37:04] maybe people can Google me and maybe they see something

Alessandro, welcome to the show. Thanks for having me. By the way, I have two cats. Most people are listening, so this doesn't apply to them. So forgive me for a moment. But if you are watching, you'll see there's two. A brother and sister cat that do everything together. And I'm working from home today and they might be walking behind me. So I apologize if that's distracting anyone or click the Alessandro. Sorry about that. Love it. Yeah. Yeah, they're still kittens technically. So they do pretty silly things. But let's get to you and get Dynasty. So this is again, a bit of a departure episode for us. We traditionally talk to top REALTORS in the country and say, Hey, how'd you do that? And which is great. And we've done, gosh, 600 plus episodes there. But I love what I get to talk to people like you who are really bringing something new to the table that REALTORS can learn from. And again, provide value to their clients. So let's start at the very beginning is just how did you get into the living trust business like tell us start us all the way back in your career? Yeah, so this actually takes me all the way back to the very beginning. My very first job at 16 years old and I can literally say everything I've done in my career has led me to this point. I mean, like it's the honest truth of my very first job at 16 years old when I was still in high school. Was that bank of America in the retail bank? It was just part time job and I started off as a teller, but I quickly moved over to the sales side of the retail bank. So whenever you know back then, I don't retail banks don't really exist very much anymore. But back then you'd walk into a bank and on one side you had the cash handling tellers. So on the other side you have the people sitting at the desk. That's what I did. I sat at the desk. And you know, I worked with individuals and helped them do mortgages and business accounts and business loans and I referred them over to the investment team. And so during that time, I actually was heavily trained in what trust in what living trust are and work. I was trained to look through the documents and to know the differences between a revocable trust and errorable trust. And your customers would want to retitle their accounts. And so we had to look through the documents and we had to make sure it reflected correctly on the accounts. On the opposite side of it when customers, you know, somebody would pass away, they would come in with the trust documents. And so I was very familiar with them already just from my close to eight years in financial services. And actually, I did Bank of America, I did Union Bank. I ended up at Washington Mutual. I was selling loans during the right leading up to the mortgage crisis, which was a very interesting time period. And so I really deep exposure into high net worth individuals and trust specifically. Fast forwarding to the kind of a second half of my career, I spent the last decade working for Silicon Valley technology companies. It was just a factor of me being born and raised in Silicon Valley. A bunch of my friends worked for, you know, their parents worked for startup companies growing up. I always knew I wanted to get into startups. But I didn't think, you know, I kind of had more of a sales background. And so I, you know, took me a while to land my first job. But once I did, it led me to joining this company, Carter, in 2014, as the first sales rep. Carter, you know, what we did was we digitized legal documents for startup companies and startup investors. So before Carter existed, you know, an investor would invest in a startup company like, you know, think about, you know, these companies that are private right now, like Stripe is a private company, you know, used to be like Airbnb and Uber. When investors used to invest in these companies, they actually would get a paper stock certificate. That was their proof of ownership. Similar to what used to exist in the public markets like 30 years ago, but in the public stock market, everything has been digitized now. And so on the private markets, it was just, it was a couple of decades behind. And so that's what we did at Carter. We sucked up all the paper, all the employee option grants, all the investor stocks certificates, and we created the registrar for private securities. And really the foundation of the company was just digitizing legal documents. And so during my time at Carter, you know, I went from, you know, company went from 10 employees to 2000 employees from zero revenue to over 300 million in annual revenue. And I kind of scaled with the company and I owned sales. At one point, I had 200 people reporting to me, a team that I built, brick by brick, you know, hired. And so I got really good experience like building out a software revenue business. And really good experience working with the product managers and the engineers. And so that led me to the point of, you know, eventually being able to have the opportunity to start my own company because I became really good friends with the Carter investors. And I became really good friends with the original engineer at Carter and the original product manager. And so we knew we wanted to start a company together. We didn't really know what to do. We were going back and forth on different ideas. And this idea was actually one that another friend of mine presented to me and he's like, you should digitize trust documents. And it was like a live bulb went off immediately because I already knew the challenges with trust documents. I already know that 95% of Americans don't have trust. Everybody should have one. Me personally, you know, I at that point I was married. I have a couple of kids. I was lucky enough to be able to take advantage of a couple of different liquidity transactions. When I worked at Carter, I was able to sell some of my stock. I had a nest egg. I had all the reasons to create a trust by still the, and I knew that trust from Port, but I still didn't have one. And so it was just a live bulb went off right away. And I knew this was this was something that we needed to fix and same exact playbook. We need digitize it. We need to make it simple and accessible for everybody. And that's how we keep the company off. Yeah, I'll tell us more about what gets get dynasty does. Yeah, so we are the easiest way for homeowners to put their home on its rest. And so we really narrowed it on homeowners. Very, very important because, you know, I think when you're building a startup company, you want to be, you want to get as focused as you can get the more specific in what your description of what you do the better. It's going to describe your strategy for product is going to help inform your partnership strategies. And so we knew we wanted to digitize trust, but we took us some time to figure out a very specific point to get into our customers and that's home ownership. And the reason why we focus on homeownership is because for most Americans, for most American adults, their home is their most important as their biggest asset. And it's a really wide market. There's 80 million homeowners in the United States. And if you look at the data, it's all public is real estate records are public. You can look and see who owns what properties. 90 to 95% of homes are not held in a trust or an LLC for that matter. They're just held in personal name. And so that's a huge issue. The richest Americans put their homes in a trust. And so those homes when they die or they become incapacitated, they don't have to go through probacore. They can go straight to their children. But for the 90 to 95% of Americans that don't have their home in a trust, if something happens to them, their home is going to get seized by the state government forced into probacore. And it's going to take their family on average 18 months to get access to the home and to be able to sell it and take the proceeds. And more importantly, this probacore is super expensive. You know, you need lawyers, there's court fees. And it creates a lot of family disputes. It actually grips families apart because the children end up going in and probating. They argue, you know, I was supposed to get this much. Even if you have a will, people think that that's what Americans think they need to have is everybody should have a will. Now, wills have to be processed through probacore. They still have to go through that 18 one process that costs tens of thousands of dollars if not more depending on the challenges. Trust are the only way to avoid probacore. Literally hundreds of billions of dollars a year gets forced into probacore because most Americans don't have their home in a trust. And so we want to that's what we want to do. We want to make it simple and easy and we have a free product. Anybody can create a free trust from their cell phone in less than five minutes. And you know, we think if you're in the market to buy a new home or you have a home, you should absolutely be putting it into a trust. So yeah, let's talk about the benefits of a trust or rather actually, let me rephrase that. Let's start with what happens. We talked about, you know, if you pass away, even if you have a will, you're still going through probacore, you're still dealing with that legal process to, you know, distribute your assets as according to your well. A lot of Americans don't even have wills, which is a whole nother issue. But let's talk about what does a trust do that a will sort of does it. Yeah, so the most important things are going to be privacy control and protection. And so privacy, when you're on your home, you know, if you have a will, you, you own your home that my home is owned by a Los Angeles road chester. And because real estate records are public, it's a very simple search. You can just search your records. You can see exactly where I live. Here's my address. But also somebody were to walk in front of my house and slip and fall. They can just do a quick search on my address. They can see that I own it and they can sue me directly. Right. They could look up your name. They could see that you were part of Carter that's now an $800 billion company. This guy might have some deep pockets. Yep. Yep. And so, but if I create a trust, I can call my trust whatever I'm wrong. I call it XYZ trust. I can call it the DJ Paris trust. Right. I can like literally deter people. And so that when somebody were to look up who owns my home, now they're going to see this trust name, this random trust name. And it's a deterrent because they don't know who owns that. They're going to have to, you know, they have to get court order to pierce the trust and figure out who owns it. So privacy is a huge reason to have trust, especially if you own real estate. The second reason is control. You know, it's direct control. You create the instructions for who's going to inherit your home when you pass away or you become incapacitated. If you have a will, you're creating those instructions, but they have to be processed by a judge. And the other day the judge is to get keeper of what happens. And oftentimes, you know, people will challenge the will and say, oh, it's unfair. This and that. And, you know, it may not always end up the way that you intended it to go as far as your distribution of your inheritance. Versus if you have a trust, it never sees a light of day unless it gets challenged. But if it doesn't get challenged, you know, your what happens is when you die or you becoming incapacitated, your successor takes over the trust and distributes the inheritance according to your wishes. And so it doesn't it doesn't go through the pro-bake court system. So control is a very big part and protection as well, you know, it's protection mainly from pro-bake court, but also potentially from lawsuits because it services is deterrent because it's harder for people to actually see who owns the property. And so it gives you some level of protection from things like lawsuits, which is different than, you know, there's also asset protection trust specifically that will give you even more protection from lawsuits and creditors and divorce and whatnot. But that's a whole different category. Is there any reason that a homeowner shouldn't have a trust? Is this applied to every homeowner or are there reasons to maybe consider not doing that? Yeah, and so this is a very simple thing to do. Like if you just go to Google and you say like, well, why should somebody not put their home in a trust or, you know, I actually use like the AI, the chat GPT. Why should what's the reason not to have the number one the only reason is because it cost that's it. And so that's what our platform does. We've removed the cost completely because traditionally you got to go see a lawyer and cost thousands of dollars. How do you keep it updated? It's going to cost you more money. It's like friction. They're like for most people, you don't need one. Well, that's wrong. If you completely removed costs because we've automated, we've made a digital, we've made it simple. Then there's no excuses. There's zero downside. It does not impact your taxes in any way, shape or form. You're going to file your taxes exactly what you've been filing it. All it does is give you the benefits that I just mentioned and that's it. That's yeah, that's it's really interesting. I am. I love that. So on get dynasty. I know there's there's two different tiers, right? You have the free tier, which allows you to create the trust. And then there's a paid tier. Let's talk about those differences and I just love that you can create a trust for free, which is insane. And then there's sort of an ongoing care tier that allows you to make changes and edit. So tell us sort of a more about what that is and what those differences are. Yeah, so the free tier anybody wants to just create like a starter trust like it's very simple. It has limited functions. You can't make it once you create it can't make any changes to it. It's kind of a simple one and done trust. Later if you want to make any updates, if you want to add a complexity to it, if you want to talk to customer support person, you want to, you know, you have questions about it. That's all part of our upgraded package for $99 a year. And so that's customers usually start with the free and then they upgrade into the paid when they want to start using it more and talk to people. And they may want to get it notarized. We have a remote notary baked into the paid plan as well. And so, you know, I think most people generally start with the free. Like if you're if you're going to have anything like having no trust is a huge problem. Like if you're like a free trust is 100% better than no trust. Yeah, no, I love that. And this is something that REALTORS are notoriously not skilled or just ignorant to all right. They just don't have this information. They'll think, oh, talk to the estate planning attorney. You know, they'll they'll help you figure out your will and your trust and maybe possibly. But this is something that you as a real estate agent can actually bring to them and say, hey, have you considered a living trust. The answer will be no for your home. They hadn't thought about that. And so, okay, great. Let's talk about that. And do you, you know, do you run into any resistance from a state planning attorneys because, of course, I would assuming they charge for living trust. So how does that sort of typically play out where you're offering this, you know, free service. And does that, you know, how does that work with the state planning attorneys? I mean, we're definitely competitive, right. But, you know, we actually have a lot of estate planning attorney partners. And I think it's pretty clear. Like the person who's going to go spend $3,000 to create a trust is going to go spend $3,000 to create trust. They're going to want them are full service experience. Our customers are the people that, you know, they might be a little bit younger. They don't have as much urgency to do it. Maybe they haven't had kids yet. Maybe they haven't been married yet. And so they don't have as much reasons to do it. The biggest reason is because it's free and it takes you less than five minutes. And if you don't do it now, when you're buying a house, you're probably never going to do it. Because it's really hard to transfer title into the trust, right. And so that's why we are partnering specifically with real estate agents and mortgage lenders. And title companies. Because we think as part of the home buying process, that's the most, it's where you can add tremendous value. Because that's when it's actually going to be free and easy. Because like they can create the trust with us in less than five minutes. And then when they close on the home, they just tell the mortgage company, hey, put it in my home. And mortgage company, tile company, they coordinate and close this straight into the home. There's no extra work that has to be done. Besides setting it up in less than five minutes on their phone. That's the best time to do it. Because if you don't do it then, and you wait, then you're going to need to try, you know, you've got to create your trust. You can do it. That's for free. But you're going to need to transfer title. And that's not free. Like if you want us to help you do that, you need to upgrade. Or if you go do that with the lawyer, they're going to want to charge you, you know, at least five hundred dollars, maybe fifteen hundred dollars. And it takes time. That, and if you try to do it yourself, you're probably never going to be able to figure it out. Like I consider myself to be a pretty savvy person. And I try to transfer my own title in the county, declined me three times in a row. And I talked, I called the county recorder. I said, I don't understand. I got the template off the internet because they won't provide the templates for deeds. So like why, what's the issue here? And they told me they could not help me. I had to see the turn. I was like, what? I was like, why can I walk into my bank and tell them I want to transfer my account to my trust and they just do it. Why can't I do that with county with my home? And they're like, it's illegal. It's a legal thing. So that's when we really honed in on this home buying process. That's when it makes the most sense. It's the simplest. That's when real estate agents can add a ton of value. Because you tell all you have to do is say, do you want to put your home in a trust? Like you're buying home. Are you planning to put in a trust? Naturally, the customer is going to say, should I? Well, like there's no reason not to. It just gives you privacy and protection control. If you want to know why go to this website, they'll show you they have a free way to do it. Every home should be in trust. We very strongly believe that. And so the only time that it's actually going to be free easy is if you took before you buy them. If you do it after, then it's going to be a little bit more complicated. Even though we still offer that product, then you're going to have to pay us money for us to help you with that. Sure. What does it cost on average? Once a home is closed and maybe it's five years later and then the person goes, I do want to put it in a trust. Just not a curiosity. Just ballpark what might they be looking at cost wise? Yeah. So you have two different options to create the trust. You can either go to attorney or you can go to one of these online trust creators, which is our main competitors. The online, you know, legal zooms, rocket lawyers and the world. The online trust creators, they're going to charge you on average like 500 dollars to create the trust. They don't help you transfer title. The little referral you to somebody else, you know, you'll try to get it done that they might charge you another a few hundred dollars. So maybe a thousand bucks, you can get it done. But a lot of that working to have to do yourself. It's a pain. Most customers don't finish it. Most online trust that are created. People don't end up transferring title. And like if you're not going to put your home in your trust, like you just wasted your money creating the trust for most Americans. And like that's your biggest asset and like you didn't even put in the trust. Like your trust is not doing very much. The alternative is you go see attorney. And the attorney is going to charge you the full package. They're going to create your trust. They're going to add on all these other things that you may not desperately need immediately like a health directive of power of attorney will all these other things. You know, I call it the equivalent of going to you know McDonald's in game the number three supersize are going to add on all these extra options are going to make sure they charge you 25 hundred dollars basically. Yeah. And not only that, but it's a pretty extensive process like and they're going to ask you all kinds of you know they want to make sure they justify that 25 hundred dollar charge. Sure. So they're going to ask they're going to give you so much complexity that you that honestly for most people all they need is who's going to inherit my home if something happens to me. That's it. That's a simple is that that's what that's what you do when you set up a trust who owns the trust and who does it go to later like that knows what the most important things does. So going back to the I'm in the process of buying a home and this is sort of the best time to consider putting it in a trust at least it's the most cost effective way and the least complicated way does it impact a homeowner or soon to be homeowners ability to borrow does it affect their mortgage is anything in that sense where now the lender looks at it a little differently. Yeah, so it's really interesting we're actually partnered with a really big top three lender and they were very eager to work with us and they know it's a huge value and one of the first questions I asked them was because I remember back in the day. You know they used to tell you okay if you're going to buy a home and you want to put in a trust just like put it in your name first and then move it to the trust after. And because mortgage company didn't want to you know didn't want it to go straight into trust and so I asked this mortgage partner of ours is big lender why are mortgage companies why do they shy away from letting people put in a trust and the response was because it's changing now it more lenders are becoming open to it. But the biggest reason why is because the lenders are lazy and they didn't want to actually they didn't want to actually look at the trust documents to make sure that it's a revulcable because revulcable trust or what you can if you have a that's what we do revulcable trust if it's a revulcable trust and it can go in your home your mortgage everything there's no issues at all it's actually a lot the garden same germane act like nobody can stop you from putting your home with the mortgage into a revulcable trust nobody can stop you from doing that if lenders try to turn you down it's because you're lazy and they don't want to look at the trust. So you don't want to ask for a trust document to make sure that it's a revulcable trust well we're solving that problem with these big partners that we're working with on the lending side because they just review our trust documents once and make sure they're good and then any customers they send to us are they don't even have to look at any more there are hundred percent of truth. So you know mortgage lenders if they give you a hard time about putting your home in a trust like you push back and there's no reason for them to do that you know any you're your home you can go in a trust by law by law home with the mortgage company. can go into a revulcable trust. Specifically, the irrevocables are different. Irrovulc, and we offer that product as well, but that's not for homeowners. Irrovulcable trust is where you're giving the asset away now. So instead of waiting with a revulcable trust, the asset will pass to your children when you die. With an irrevocable trust, you're basically saying, here's my money, I'm putting it in the revulcable trust, and I'm giving it to my children now. So I don't know any more. And of course, you can't do that with a mortgage on it. Of course, you can't give away a home that you don't completely own. Sure. So for mortgages, as long as it's a revulcable trust, which is what 99% of people create, that's our product, that's our free product, and our $99 your product. Everybody will let you put your home into every vocal trust. Yeah, get Dynasty.com is where you can go and set up your own living trust for your own property, for your own properties, if you're an investor, of course, as well as to make sure you tell all of your clients about this. And I was thinking, I'm just putting my marketing hat on, you know, I know it's fun to give a closing gift when a property closes, of course, so a REALTOR to a client. And yes, those are cool and fun. But a lot of times, if we think about the gift suite, we give how useful are they? Are they being utilized? Maybe, but if you're looking for a new idea, this is a pretty useful idea. Maybe you pay for the first year, if you want to give them that option, or sort of give them the upgraded version for the first, maybe you pay for three years, and then you just somehow figure out a way to do that. But I see some sort of way where an agent could bring that and say, hey, I want to help you, really get a good service here, and make sure if you have any questions about this trust along the way that they're going to be able to assist you and it's 99 bucks a year, it's not a big deal. This is something, and then if you want to continue on, you can continue on after that. Have you seen any REALTOR's starting to do that, like offering this as a, hey, closing gift, or just, I offer this as part of my service, things like that? That's really interesting. So we haven't done that yet with REALTOR's, but financial advisors do that all day with us. And they specifically pay for their clients in the upgraded package, because they, number one, it's a really unique thing to do for your client. But number two, because they're paying for their trust, it creates a stickier relationship with the advisor. It's like now, send, if they, you know, they keep having that reminder every time they use it, they're like my financial advisor is paying for this. So if they unwind that relationship with the financial advisor, they have to unwind that trust. It's just more complicated, more friction to stop using them. And I think with real estate age, I don't know what the date is, but I would love to know, like, people at buy houses like, on average, how many years before they sell that house and buy another one? You really like seven, like seven, I think? Yeah. And so like, you want to maintain that relationship with that. 100% And so then it's also a way to reengage with old clients. Like we have loan officers that are doing that. They're like, hey, like all, you know, here's a free option or here's a paid option. Like we want to, you know, keep that relationship going and re-engaging. It's a way to add, re-engage them and add value, which may open up the next opportunity for you. Yeah, I see also an opportunity for education here. So REALTORS, oftentimes, will do seminars or webinars, things like, you know, so you want to buy a condo or you want to buy your first home or, or, you know, investment property, sort of 101, or whatever topics that your, you know, your sphere of influence are interested in. This is a great topic that no one else is doing. If you're doing, you know, you know, becoming going from renter to buyer, yes, that's great, but that's being done in your local market a lot. You know, people do those. That's not super unique. It's a good one, but it's not unique. This is a unique one. And this is, you know, I would even call it something like why every single homeowner needs to have a trust or something to that effect. And, you know, because if it's every single homeowner that applies to literally everybody who owns a property and this now becomes something that appeals to a much wider audience than having this narrow focus. There's very few things in life or in business that apply to kind of everybody. This is kind of one of those unique opportunities to kind of get ahead of the curve. And Alessandro is bringing this product to like the market for free. He's basically, he's doing kind of a version in a way of what Zillow did, is bringing something that used to be behind lock and key and cost a lot of money to the public. And, you know, he's got some subscription options. So if you want to, you know, increase your level of service and support, you can do that. But he's basically bringing you something that used to be really in the shadows and only understood by estate planning attorneys and maybe financial advisors and accountants possibly. But really, you know, it's funny. I'll tell a quick story. I know that and REALTORS too, I want you to think about your own property and your own business because, you know, this really also is a great reminder that if you are a REALTOR listening which you probably are, consider talking to your accountant about forming a corporation, whether it's a seat corporation and S corporation, there are true benefits, tax benefits to doing so. There's different benefits for different types of structures. But I just went through this myself. I went to buy a car. This is how ignorant I am. And I went to buy a car recently, a couple of weeks ago and bought a car forever. And I was just signing all the paper just ready to walk out with my new car. And I said, maybe I should buy this in my company name like it just occurred to me on the way out the door. Thankfully I hadn't signed everything yet. And so I got on the, I was like, it's not dumb, I am. I'm like, I probably should ask my accountant. So I asked her, shut her message, should I buy this in my company name? Cause I don't know. And cause I've looked it up before and it was confusing like sort of sometimes, but maybe not always. And she was like, absolutely no brainer. And so this is just one of those things that like, I'm embarrassed. I actually, and I'm not saying this to humble brag because these are all small companies. But I have like four small companies. You would think that I would know that this is a good idea. And I did not. So thankfully my accountant was good and was like, yes, do it this way. And this way and we got it done. And it was, it was easy peasy. And there's some true benefit to doing that. So you know, for everyone listening, yes, this is a great opportunity for your clients. Start with yourself because you want to talk about, I did this for me. I went on their website. I did it for free. It took five minutes. And here's what it does to protect my home. And here's how it protects my estate. And you know, use that as your sort of, you know, North stars like, no, I do this for me. And here's why I can tell everybody else to do it. So I see this as a webinar play. I see this as of course talking with every client you have individually. But I see this as I see YouTube or Facebook shorts, Instagram shorts, YouTube shorts. I see you going to saying, hey, I've got this cool thing that you probably haven't thought of. And this applies to everyone reach out to me and we can talk more about it, right? Things like that. I see this as a lead generation tool quite frankly. As in addition to a huge value add to the clients, I see this as an attractor because you're basically providing something that I, I mean, attorneys aren't notoriously great lesser in personal injury are not, you know, really great at marketing or advertising, you know, the personal injury guys are, you see them on billboards. We don't usually see a lot of estate planning people sort of out there. So you have to seek those people out and that's why a lot of people don't have wills because we don't see a lot of messaging that's like, or trust like, hey, you should probably consider doing this. If you look for it, you can find it, but who looks for it? It's like insurance. Like you sort of have to have somebody bugging you a little bit going, hey, we need to look at your insurance. You need to have insurance, you know, and so this is one of those, this is one of those unique sort of products that really fits everybody. And yet no one's really servicing this particular market and REALTORS can kind of step in and be that proactive guide to those clients and start with yourself. I'm gonna do this for myself. Now it's gonna cost me because I've already bought my home, but there's some, look, I have businesses. There's probably a good reason for me to protect this condo. And so I will look into doing that and I'll shame on me for not doing it ahead of time. I'll have to pay extra. Don't make this the same thing for you or your clients. Make this something that you enter into your business. This is a differentiator in my mind. So I'll send her, I think this is great. I wanna wrap up here because I think we got to the point. We told everybody what they need to do. Guys, get Dynasty.com is where you go. You can set up your own living trust there in five, 10 minutes. It's good, it's legal, it's valid. And if you want to upgrade, and I would absolutely encourage you to upgrade, at least for the first year or two, just in case anything goes wrong and you need that customer support. Guys, it's $99 a year, not a big deal, right? We can all afford this. And consider this as part of your closing gift package to your clients. On the buy side for sure, right? And even on the sell side, you can say, hey, when you buy your next home, we're going to, you know, assuming they're not buying one at that time, we're selling this home. Next time, we're putting this next one in a trust. It was kind of like, you know, this is kind of a morbid thing to say. And I apologize for it, but it's a good analogy. I went, I was married once, many, many years ago, and the marriage didn't work out like over half of the marriages in this country did. And I remember my divorce attorney who, on the way out, who's a lovely woman, she goes, if you ever get married again, you are getting a, and that's an, I'm not like a wealthy guy, but she goes, you're getting a prenup and I was like, I have like nothing at the time. I had no money. She goes, you're still getting a prenup. And, and, and, and by the way, backslip is amazing and we didn't have any issues in the divorce, but even that being amicable, she was like, you have to get a prenup next time. I was like, oh, I do. She goes, yes. And so this is kind of one of those situations, similar to that where you don't want your client to find out that they should have done this. So this is an opportunity, you know, yeah, maybe go back to your previous clients who do own homes, ask them to consider doing it, but yes, they're gonna pay a bit for that. But certainly, for anyone buying a home, this is where you can provide an incredible amount of value. It doesn't delay the closing process. It doesn't affect the lender relationship or the opportunity to get a mortgage. It's just a way to protect the asset and protect privacy, right? So we know that real estate records have to be public. They have to. Our whole democratic system is built upon the ability to get information. We have to know who owns property. And this is a way to, to make that a little bit harder to find and to literally protect it. So that people can't look up and, and, and see that, you know, maybe people can Google me and maybe they see something they like and go, hmm, I want to, I'm gonna go after that guy in his assets. So I am, I'll center, I'm so, so grateful that you had reached out. And this is so perfect for our audience. And I know, really encourage everybody to go to get dynasty.com. Again, it's free. Why not? Go ahead and do it and consider upgrading. So you can really get the full package. You're going to maybe need to edit the estate at one point. We can't do that with a free plan. You can for the, the, the annual plan, $99. It's, it's, it's about as inexpensive as a service like that. You'll never get a legal service like that for, for that inexpensive price that, or that kind of quality. So it's kind of a no brainer. But it's a very least go do the free version and, and, and, and protect your own assets. And of course, tell that to your client. So I'll center on behalf of all of our listeners, really, and our viewers, thank you so much for bringing this to my attention. I was ignorant to this and we've got almost 800 REALTORS at our company. I'm a bit embarrassed that I didn't know this. I'm going to bring this to them.
