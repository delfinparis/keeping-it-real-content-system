[00:03:43] Today, our guest is Julia Stover with McDonald Realty in beautiful Vancouver, British Columbia,
[00:03:51] Canada, of course. Let me tell you more about Julia. Now Julia is an award-winning agent with
[00:03:57] McDonald Realty in beautiful West Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. She fell into the insurance
[00:04:02] industry at a young age, but she never felt quite right there. I bet a lot of people who jump in
[00:04:08] to insurance early on probably don't my dad say the same thing didn't feel quite right. She was always
[00:04:14] the more out there person at the insurance aid, the insurance company, but 25 years later when her
[00:04:20] daughter was headed for university, full of inspiration, she promised herself she would have a new
[00:04:26] career by her 50th birthday. She made the change carefully and nine years later, as a REALTOR has
[00:04:33] never looked back. Through crafting great connections and building relationships, she's created a
[00:04:39] business that she loves, combines her attention to detail and business background with her love of
[00:04:44] marketing and creativity. I want everybody to follow Julia on Instagram, which you can find her
[00:04:52] Julia Stoffer.ca. We will have a link to that in the show notes. It's st-a-u-f-f-e-r.ca. So Julia
[00:04:59] Stoffer.ca. And also that's her website as well. Julia Stoffer.ca. And I really encourage you to take
[00:05:05] a look at her website. I particularly like the design and look of it. Julia, thanks for being on the show.
[00:05:11] Hi DJ, thanks very much for having me. I just kicked my table, that's awesome.
[00:05:16] Well, yeah, I knock things all over all the time here and guests probably are like, what's that
[00:05:22] big loud crashing sound? And I usually don't even address it. I just kind of plow forward. But
[00:05:29] I'm excited because I think so many people get into real estate as a second career or an alternative
[00:05:37] career or they start in real estate as a part-time agent when they're doing something else and they
[00:05:42] eventually transition. But I love that you sort of had a clean break and at 50. So tell us that
[00:05:49] story. How did you get into real estate? Well, yeah. So as you said in my little introduction there,
[00:05:56] yes, a lot of people fall into, I was one of those people in high school who just,
[00:06:02] we're leaving high school, oh my gosh, what do you want to do when you grow up? I have no idea.
[00:06:07] And so when you don't have any plan in your head, you just sort of end up falling. And that's what I
[00:06:12] ended up doing. So through mutual connections, I fell into the insurance industry. And in the
[00:06:17] beginning of my insurance industry, I actually fell into like road service, auto driving around.
[00:06:24] We had a little territory with another gal. And it was very much, you know, I sort of felt it
[00:06:30] wasn't real insurance. Like it was just kind of fun. And when you're 20, right? And you know, we had
[00:06:35] salespeople, we had to keep happy. And you know, it was, it was a very fun and we got to do whatever
[00:06:40] we wanted. And so that was really fun. And you know, in your early 20s, that was a great, you know,
[00:06:46] great, it was a great career. And we could, then we make a money. I was totally on commission at
[00:06:49] that point. So it was, you know, that was, that was my intro to sort of business. But, you know,
[00:06:56] we got a little bit older. We were going to get married. And I thought, you know, if I'm going
[00:06:59] to be in this insurance thing, I better get into some real insurance. So, you know, get into an
[00:07:04] office, do some personal insurance. I go learn real insurance. But around that time, we got married
[00:07:10] in the next year. And I never went back to work full time after that. So my daughter was born,
[00:07:15] and I worked three, four days a week. And, you know, went from personal insurance and then
[00:07:20] ended up in one of the biggest insurance brokers in the world, actually, doing commercial
[00:07:25] insurance with really large mining companies or Vancouver's, I really had quarters from mining
[00:07:31] in the world, actually, and worked with some massive companies. And it was really, I enjoyed the
[00:07:37] people that I worked with. But the business, every time I tried to, you know, I worked with some
[00:07:43] of the top people in as sort of the helping backstage person. But I would always take me to meetings,
[00:07:50] because I was good with people. And, but it was when, you know, some younger people came in and they
[00:07:55] wanted me to do just a spreadsheet. So not go to the meeting. I'm like, oh, I'm not very good at
[00:07:59] those spreadsheets. I prefer the, the contract. So, you know, so I started realizing as my daughter was,
[00:08:06] you know, heading toward leaving high school and going to university. She was making all these
[00:08:09] plans. And I thought, you know, what? I think, you know, if I'm going to make a leap, I've got a
[00:08:15] planet now. And it's got to be, you know, I don't want to have that cake at my desk at the
[00:08:21] real estate, at the insurance office. I need to be somewhere else by the time that happens. So,
[00:08:26] so that was, that was the plan. And, you know, the question, you know, real estate, I mean, obviously
[00:08:30] everybody, especially Vancouver, real estate is something that everyone's interested in. It's,
[00:08:35] you know, you know, it's a fun industry, obviously. And so it was something that had always been
[00:08:40] in the back of my mind. I'd done sort of creative things. I actually took a broadcast journalism
[00:08:44] course when I was about 28. So, you know, creativity and that sort of thing was always, I'd always
[00:08:50] sort of looked for little paths to try to break out. But, you know, insurance is a, is a very stable,
[00:08:55] well-paying career. And, you know, it's hard to break out, that's for sure. So, yeah, you
[00:09:01] sure. But, you know, it's been sort of looking for these little avenues to sort of have these
[00:09:05] little creative outlets. So, well, it's interesting because you really went from a steady income to,
[00:09:12] you know, an unsteady income, right, in real estate. And, and that is a, it takes a tremendous
[00:09:17] amount of courage. I know, obviously, a lot of our listeners have taken that plunge as well. And,
[00:09:22] it's a tough one. I actually did navigate two years of part because I was working part-time. I
[00:09:29] was only working three days a week. And so, I was able to, when I first started. So, I was showing
[00:09:36] up on the days I wasn't at work at the office. And then everyone was leaving the office. And I
[00:09:41] was coming into the office because I was 5 o'clock. And so, I did navigate a couple of years of that.
[00:09:46] But, it was, yeah. But, I loved it. So, people are, you know, people I worked with were saying,
[00:09:52] well, you know, aren't you tired? Like, you're working here. And then you're working there. I'm
[00:09:55] like, oh, yeah, but you don't understand that work doesn't feel like work. You know, because you
[00:10:00] get to do it at your own pace. And the office, I always felt like I was in the office. And I was
[00:10:04] biting, I was getting paid by the hour. Like, you're, it's the time you spend. Not, not working on
[00:10:11] something that you just work, work, work, work, work through it. And then you cut to the other side.
[00:10:15] There was something so satisfying about the process and real estate that you were.
[00:10:20] Well, let's talk about that. So, so you got your license. You, you had been working training. And,
[00:10:26] and how did you go about starting to shift, you know, the people in your life who, hopefully,
[00:10:35] would ultimately end up, you know, using you or at least recommending you to people. How did you
[00:10:40] start to transition people to start seeing you as as the commercial insurance, you know, person
[00:10:46] over to real estate? Yeah. I mean, a lot of people that I worked with, you know, all was saw me as
[00:10:53] sort of the very sort of a little bit more out there. So when I started doing that, people like,
[00:10:58] oh, that makes sense for you to do something like that. I mean, it just made sense. So a lot of
[00:11:02] people that I worked with were really happy for me and sort of supported me, not necessarily in
[00:11:08] transactions right away. I've got to say that transitioning at 50 is a difficult time to use
[00:11:13] your sphere because most people that you know, it's not like in your 20s. They're already in their
[00:11:17] forever home. That's right. They're they haven't bought, they're not buying their first condo. They're
[00:11:21] not, you know, everybody's sort of in a place where it's difficult. So your own sphere is very
[00:11:26] difficult. But a lot of support as far as, you know, joining me on social media following me,
[00:11:33] all of those sorts of things, they were very, very supportive in that way. I was very lucky that
[00:11:38] my brother was all as in the branding space. So he was able to help me sort of get my name plate
[00:11:45] together, get my website, not when I have now, but my original website together and really kind of
[00:11:51] gave me a really good look and feel that I was comfortable with. So I didn't have to struggle
[00:11:57] with that, which is I know that something that agents really struggle with in the beginning,
[00:12:01] like having a uniform look and identity. So I was really lucky from that perspective that my
[00:12:07] brother sort of helps me have something clean to start with and I could run with that. So yeah,
[00:12:14] so and you know, landing at the right brokerage, that is key, right? So I'd come from an insurance
[00:12:21] industry, very male dominated. And in NBC right before I decided to take the realistic course,
[00:12:29] it went from a one month, do it yourself course, to a very long process actually, like I,
[00:12:35] you know, nine months, I think where you have to do all sorts of steps and it changed right before
[00:12:41] I decided to do it, which was quite interesting. But yeah, so then you get to the other side and now
[00:12:48] what, where am I going to go? So I've got this list of all the brokerages that I'm going to have to
[00:12:53] visit to figure out where I'm going to land because that's so important, try it. Yeah, and a lot of
[00:12:59] agents really, probably to their detriment, just go with the first brokerage that they talk to,
[00:13:06] right? Because it can be, it can be very exciting, you know, I just passed my exam, I want to,
[00:13:11] you know, get into it and then they find out, you know, six months down the road,
[00:13:15] ooh, there's other other opportunities. So, well, it's funny you should say that actually because
[00:13:20] I was drawn to McDonald Realty for some reason. There was a video and the director of our agent
[00:13:27] development who's been with McDonald Realty for over, over 25 years on Mark Bochoret,
[00:13:33] maybe if I'm wrong on that. He had a video on there about joining McDonald Realty and he's
[00:13:39] British and I have that British background and I immediately connected with that and I thought
[00:13:44] it's also an independent brokerage since 1944 in BC, you know, independent owned by a woman,
[00:13:52] it's now the biggest, biggest business in BC owned by a woman. Yeah, we have a, over 1100
[00:13:59] agents and 20 offices now. Amazing. Yeah, so she bought the existing brokerage in the 90s and it
[00:14:06] was nice, so we're as celebrating 80 years now. And so I thought, oh, I like feel of that and so I
[00:14:13] called and got an appointment with Pat Place who is the managing broker in the Westman office and
[00:14:19] I sat down with her and we laughed our heads off for an hour and shouted and that was it. I had
[00:14:27] another one booked that afternoon and I canceled it. Actually, I knew I didn't know but it didn't go
[00:14:32] well. It didn't go well. You weren't laughing for a full hour. No, no, she, you know when you just
[00:14:39] really connect with someone. You know, you know when you know. You know when you know exactly.
[00:14:43] Yeah, it was just one of those moments where I thought, you know, this vibe of this woman when
[00:14:48] I've come from this sort of more male dominated kind of industry, I thought, oh, this is, this is
[00:14:53] where I belong. So you had some help around branding and marketing with family members, then you
[00:15:00] know, you got your license, you got a great brokerage to join. And then how did you go about
[00:15:07] building your business? What was it like? How was it going out and finding clients? Do you have any,
[00:15:14] you remember those days that nine years ago and how did you start prospecting?
[00:15:21] Mainly, mainly it was through connections with referrals and that continues to be a very big part
[00:15:28] of my business for sure. You know, it's that first person that connects you with one person that
[00:15:34] connects you with the next one. We also have a lot of connections. I've met some people that had
[00:15:39] connections in the mortgage industry. So I had some referrals through that. And just one thing led
[00:15:46] to another in that way. You know, everybody tries everything at that point, right? So now someone
[00:15:53] in my building is doing a renovation. So you can probably hear a drill right now. But yeah, so,
[00:15:58] you know, Dornahi tried it. Wow. Wow. Yeah, it's, that's, that's an interesting thing to do.
[00:16:07] I, yeah, not something for me. Yeah, very difficult. You can knock on one door and there's nobody
[00:16:14] there and then you get all excited and to try to the next one and there's nobody there. And then
[00:16:18] it's a very draining sort of thing to do. Absolutely. And I think, you know, we're a very saturated
[00:16:25] market with REALTORS here in North Vancouver, Vancouver, really. So it's not really somewhere
[00:16:31] where people really appreciate that. I mean, nine years ago, maybe, but not so much. And we also have
[00:16:39] a big glut of foreign buyers. And there were a lot of homes that weren't really occupied. So it
[00:16:47] wasn't like a neighborhood where, you know, you were just folksy with everybody. It's, it's a big
[00:16:52] city, small city, you know, so, yeah, very different in that way. So definitely. And also, you
[00:17:01] know, like you have, you know, resources, McDonald Rios, so agent friendly and trying to, you know,
[00:17:07] ensure agent success. And that was where we had the, I had the connection with Mark Winter,
[00:17:13] who's the agent development director. And, you know, taking advantage of everything that the
[00:17:19] brokerage offered as far as, you know, how, you know, connecting with people and, and, you know,
[00:17:25] and the next steps in the journey and really just making sure that you were really taking care of
[00:17:31] people and connecting with people. Yeah, I think the connection is really, it doesn't really get
[00:17:39] talked about as much. You know, we're talking about really building a business by referral and how
[00:17:45] do we do that? Well, you have to know a lot of people if you're going to do that. And in order to
[00:17:49] know a lot of people, you have to meet a lot of people and then you have to develop relationships with
[00:17:53] them and then deepen those relationships. Right? So it's a process, but I think it's the,
[00:18:02] I think ultimately it's the easiest path or rather the gentlest path because it's rocky at first
[00:18:09] because these are people that may or may not need your services for years and years. And you
[00:18:16] sort of as an agent are waiting, hopefully eagerly in the wings, but providing value along,
[00:18:23] along the way so that when they are ready, of course, that they pick up the phone and contact you.
[00:18:29] And but it all starts with beating people. And I always said like, I learned this
[00:18:35] from a business seminar that I was at like 20 years ago. It was just blew my mind and it's so
[00:18:43] silly, but it it it's going to sound silly, but it it really blew my mind. It's like if you would
[00:18:46] have double your income, double your leads. And I was like, Oh, yeah, that makes sense. Well,
[00:18:51] how do I do that? Well, I'd have to meet twice as many people as I already have. And if I assume
[00:18:56] the same, you know, ratios as far as meeting to actual clothes, whatever those, you know, as they
[00:19:02] funnel through, if I just meet twice as many people, theory, I should have twice as much business.
[00:19:08] And again, it's a really simple way to look at it, but it is true. So I wanted to talk a little
[00:19:13] bit about your network and how do you engage with your network, your sphere of influence, how do you
[00:19:20] stay on stay front of mind? And how do you stay in communication? Well, this this sort of leads into
[00:19:29] my, you know, love of creativity and doing these things. I jumped into so nine years ago. I mean,
[00:19:35] Facebook was sort of the one to start on. And I was comfortable using that. I actually helped my
[00:19:41] sister-in-law prior to that building a skincare brand. And my brother was also helping us with
[00:19:48] marketing. So we jumped into Facebook fairly quickly. So I was quite comfortable with that
[00:19:52] platform. And that's sort of where you started sort of building something. And and then from that,
[00:20:00] you know, it's a matter of a building out who you're talking to. And that over time,
[00:20:06] then you jump to Instagram. And so that's sort of where I got the connection of wanting to do more.
[00:20:12] I was always, I always had the good look of how things came together. I felt comfortable speaking.
[00:20:19] But video is something that obviously, you know, is really for right now. So that sort of, I was doing
[00:20:28] it. And I was feeling okay with it. But really, it wasn't till I heard Kim Riffurg on your podcast
[00:20:35] that I decided to really jump into the video space. And not just video as far as, you know, I mean,
[00:20:42] everyone's doing walking around homes and zooming around. You know, it's not that. It's more about
[00:20:47] the connection piece, right? So it's the connection of those people, yes, your top of mind because of
[00:20:54] whatever you're selling at the moment. But there's all there's value in even if they're not
[00:20:58] interested in that home or that area, there's value in learning about you. And I must say here in
[00:21:05] BC, we've had so many, well, we've had regulatory changes, not like the big regulatory changes that
[00:21:11] you've had there in the US, but but in BC housing is a big issue and there's been a lot of regulatory
[00:21:17] changes, especially even with the real estate business. When I got into the business in 2015,
[00:21:24] it was a little bit more of the Wild West than it had, you know, then when I actually got in,
[00:21:30] a lot of new things came in at that time and a lot of agents were going, oh my god, you know,
[00:21:34] we're being heavily regulated. And I'd come from 25 years in the insurance industry, which is very
[00:21:39] regulated. And so that didn't phase me. I didn't have any, you know, problem with that. You know,
[00:21:46] and it was new to me. So change is easy when you're not stuck in an old habit, right? Yeah. So,
[00:21:51] you know, so from the changes that we've had to go through, you know, communicating those
[00:21:56] changes to the public. So they understand, because the media when things change, they're all, oh,
[00:22:04] this scary thing is happening. Sure. Real tears are terrible people and they have to do this and they
[00:22:08] have to do that. Not understanding that it's the industry needing to change because it's a different
[00:22:13] world than it was 25 years ago, right? So yeah, I agree. So yeah, we're going through here in the US
[00:22:21] obviously a lot of change right now. You know, we are literally, well, we were at the precipice
[00:22:28] and we just crossed over and we're now going to see what happens. But it's ultimately, I think I
[00:22:36] think it'll be a good thing for our industry. I hope I'm not totally sure yet what we'll shake out.
[00:22:43] But what I do know is the top agents I've talked to seem to think, you know, this what will be good
[00:22:50] for the industry now is the agents who really take it seriously and really this is their, you know,
[00:22:56] the best agents will thrive. And maybe the weaker agents won't and maybe they'll wither and go away.
[00:23:05] And that means more market share for the top agents. And so I think this is like a great time to
[00:23:12] sharpen skills. So you talked about video. Let's talk about video. So this is a newer thing for you. How do
[00:23:19] you approach content video content for your sphere? So with, yeah, I mean, and that's a big part of it too.
[00:23:29] You know, people think, well, you're going on Instagram and doing these videos to try to, you know,
[00:23:35] obviously it's great if you're capturing leans that are just out of the blue. And but mainly it
[00:23:40] is keeping top of mind. It's people that you are connected with in the periphery and making sure
[00:23:47] that they they they really understand your value and you are the one they reach out to. So it's,
[00:23:53] it's, you know, really a combination of the personal and the educational piece and then of course
[00:24:02] your neighborhood and you're, you know, where you work. So it's a matter of, you know, location,
[00:24:10] personality and education are the pieces that I've. So when you're doing, when you're doing videos,
[00:24:15] are you doing short form videos like a minute or two? Are they longer form? Like what works best for you?
[00:24:22] Um, they're usually, yeah, usually in, you know, no more than three minutes or so. You know, um,
[00:24:29] there are, you know, obviously when you're, you know, if you have a listing and you're doing something
[00:24:33] a little bit longer, there's sometimes that falls into it. But most of it is shorter.
[00:24:38] YouTube is a channel. I haven't really put enough content there. And that's part of what
[00:24:45] you're learning is, you know, to figure out where your audience is. So where, where is best for you
[00:24:50] to put your content? Um, I think LinkedIn can be very valuable. If you have a lot of business
[00:24:57] connections, I think, you know, that that's the very, that's somewhere where you can really establish
[00:25:02] your credibility. LinkedIn is important for that because I think people will see you in, in
[00:25:09] the Facebook and Instagram. But, you know, if they're a business person, they'll probably check you
[00:25:14] out on LinkedIn, right? You know, that, that's a really great point that doesn't get brought up
[00:25:19] enough with my guests. And I, LinkedIn never gets talked about. So I'm glad that we're talking about
[00:25:25] it now because it is kind of the forgotten social media channel. Um, we, we, no, people don't go to
[00:25:33] LinkedIn for fun. Maybe I think fun is Facebook and Instagram. But they go to LinkedIn to see what's
[00:25:40] going on. And, um, they might not be fun, but it might be, but it's interesting. And so, and,
[00:25:46] and again, LinkedIn is fun as well. But I think there's a large untapped potential
[00:25:53] because we don't think about, um, LinkedIn as something that, that we're perusing, that the
[00:26:00] average consumer's perusing every day. But anyone who's in business is probably on LinkedIn way more
[00:26:05] than you think. And I think that's a huge opportunity. I mean, we stream this podcast to LinkedIn.
[00:26:10] And we get lots of attention there. And I never would have guessed that before a starting this. So,
[00:26:16] what, what I do, I recommend for video for, um, people who are listening, of course, is yeah,
[00:26:22] you know, put content on LinkedIn as well. It's, it's a great place, you know, maybe make the content
[00:26:27] a little bit more professional or post content that is more professional there. And, uh, a little bit
[00:26:33] more buttoned up, maybe. And then you can be a little sillier, I think, with the, uh, YouTube.
[00:26:39] Absolutely. And, and also Instagram and Facebook and TikTok, of course, too. Um, so,
[00:26:44] I don't think it's necessarily where you sell a property. It's more where you establish your
[00:26:49] credibility. Yes. I think that's, I think that's fair. And, and I think the, the thing that we
[00:26:55] also should always be mindful of is everybody's going to Google you. No matter, yeah, no matter,
[00:27:01] you know, how long you've been in the business, how many awards or, or non-awards you have,
[00:27:07] they're going to do a quick search just to, you know, people do that. And it's really important to
[00:27:13] have a good sense of what comes up. You know, everybody should Google themselves and, and get a sense of
[00:27:18] like what's showing up. And, and is this the sort of brand I want to, I want to project. I want to
[00:27:23] go back to your brand, um, because you, you had some help around branding and a lot of people really
[00:27:29] don't get that help. Tell us what your brand is and how you sort of arrived at that.
[00:27:35] Um, it was more just wanting to have just a clean look. I wanted to have, you know,
[00:27:42] everybody wants to have your name plate. So it's very clear. Um, I wanted to be just straight
[00:27:47] forward. I actually never even got a headshot done. I, I had a photo. Seems ridiculous. It seems
[00:27:54] really, I just got my first headshot done a month ago. I have been using a photo from a, a,
[00:28:00] a Christmas party, um, which I just really liked the, like, just how I felt I came across. And I
[00:28:09] think that's really what you're looking for. Because taking a photo is, you know, an unnatural
[00:28:17] experience. And I felt I just had something that worked. I said to friends, I said, is this,
[00:28:23] is it wrong for me to do that? I know this is really strange. But what do you think? And they're like,
[00:28:28] no, that, that's you when you're at your best connecting with people and happy and engaged.
[00:28:33] I'm like, okay, because if I now go and try to get a headshot, I know, you know, and now I'm
[00:28:39] confident in who I am as a REALTOR. And I can get a photo taken because I feel, you know, in the
[00:28:44] beginning, you're like, well, who am I? And I'm like, you know, got you, you know, everybody's got
[00:28:47] the hands crossed pose and all of those things. And it's sort of like, no, I, I, I don't want to do
[00:28:52] that right now. I need to be me, whoever I am at that point in time. And, and that's sort of what
[00:28:59] I ran with. So I think it was, you know, maybe, maybe people felt that authenticity, the ease, maybe,
[00:29:05] yeah. Absolutely. Yeah. I think, I think that's true. Like, there's a particular push these days for
[00:29:13] style where headshots maybe aren't as invogue as they used to be where it's more now photographs,
[00:29:21] photography capturing somebody doing something. Right. I think sort of like catching them doing
[00:29:25] something that they're passionate about. Yeah. Is, is always more interesting to me because then I
[00:29:31] get to learn a little bit about the person inside of that photo. Right. So if anyone out there is
[00:29:36] listening and has a look, everyone probably has a headshot, there's nothing wrong with headshots
[00:29:40] are great. They're useful. And I would also encourage you to have, you know, get some action shots
[00:29:47] of you doing, you know, whether it's real estate activities or non real estate activities, whatever
[00:29:53] someone's passionate about, we want to connect consumers want to connect with their agent. They
[00:29:58] want to know what does their agent do? What is it? What is their agent into? And that would be a great
[00:30:04] place to do that. I, I wanted to, you're a very creative person. I wanted to talk about creativity
[00:30:10] and how that has played into your business. Can you give us some examples of how you've used
[00:30:17] creativity to build your business? I think obviously, you know, creating your own content, you know,
[00:30:25] everybody plays around with in the beginning, whether you get someone else to do stuff for you or
[00:30:30] you do it yourself or, you know, you know, you know, and you can, and you can you do it yourself.
[00:30:34] Not everybody has that creative bench, right. You'd like to not pay someone to do it, but you're
[00:30:40] not that comfortable doing it yourself. So from my perspective, luckily, I enjoyed the process of
[00:30:46] using different programs to create content. Obviously, that can be a little bit of a runaway
[00:30:53] train time wise because you, you're perfecting and you want to change things and you've always
[00:30:57] want to, you see a new thing that you can use and you're sort of wanting to use every new tool
[00:31:02] that comes along. But so yeah, I, I, I really enjoy that piece of the process and so I do like to
[00:31:11] develop my own things, but I've also always taken, taken courses. I'm a, my daughter calls me the
[00:31:19] self-help, you know, queen because every book, not so much books. I don't, I don't read. I know
[00:31:26] it sounds terrible. I don't read novels and when I did read, it was always self-help books. I,
[00:31:32] something or autobiographies. Now I have Audible, so I don't even actually have to read them.
[00:31:36] I used to skim them really, but Audible is doing really great. So, you know, I'm always
[00:31:41] picking up the next thing, you know, about how, you know, pushing forward and creativity and,
[00:31:47] and new things to do. So, so that part of it really excites me. I love that piece of it.
[00:31:54] You know, it's interesting. I didn't really thought of it too much until you just said this, but
[00:31:59] we've been doing the show many, many years. And one of the real key personality traits or
[00:32:07] characteristics that I've noticed, but I hadn't really congealed this thought until just now,
[00:32:14] is this sort of lifetime of learning attribute that seems to be very consistent among top performers.
[00:32:22] There's this willingness and excitement to sort of learn something new. And Emerson, you know,
[00:32:30] you talked about when you first got into your brokerage at McDonald, doing all of their training.
[00:32:35] I mean, as sort of rudimentary as that sounds, we have 800 agents at our company here. I can tell you,
[00:32:43] a lot of them have never come to training programs. And that's not to say that there's anything wrong
[00:32:49] with those people who haven't, maybe they're busy, they haven't. But as a result of not going through
[00:32:55] and continually learning, you know, their business is only going to grow at a certain percentage.
[00:33:01] And so it's funny. When I first, first, first got into this business, I asked a REALTOR in my hometown,
[00:33:09] who was one of the top REALTOR's there. I didn't know anything about real estate. I said,
[00:33:13] his name is Brian. I said, Brian, why are you like the number seven highest producing agent in
[00:33:20] Pioria, Illinois, have all places? And he goes, he looked at me and he goes, I cannot tell you other than,
[00:33:27] I'm usually the first one here in the morning. And he's like, I don't come at 6 a.m. He's like,
[00:33:31] I get here at 8 a.m. He goes, and I leave it like 6 p.m. You know, a pretty normal day.
[00:33:37] I answer my phone, I make my calls, like he was just like, you just do the thing. And
[00:33:45] and I go, well, there's more to it than that. He goes, well, yeah, but not really. He's like,
[00:33:50] it's really mostly that. Yeah, I mean, you just have to be showing up all the time and not,
[00:33:55] I don't mean on Instagram, Facebook. I mean, in life, right? And I'd come from going to an office
[00:34:01] every day. So, you know, I told myself actually that I was going to start going to the gym
[00:34:08] at seven in the morning because I wanted to make sure I kept up that routine of getting up early
[00:34:14] and being up and dressed and ready to roll at nine o'clock. You know, and you know, that's changed a
[00:34:20] little bit because real estate kind of slipped into. Maybe nine thirty, but basically, you know, I,
[00:34:25] you know, I don't, I'm ready to roll. If somebody called, I'd be ready anytime to go somewhere at nine
[00:34:31] o'clock. Yeah. It's kind of how I am. Like, you know, I'm, I'm not in my jammies until 11 o'clock,
[00:34:36] even though I could be working because I don't have anywhere to go. But what if, what if someone calls
[00:34:41] and I need to go, I gotta be ready. Well, getting, look, getting in physical shape, I, you know,
[00:34:47] this has been a huge, I, a huge thing for me, a huge hurdle for me to, to get over. I, I really was
[00:34:54] not an exercise person up until about those, now I'm four years in. Prior to that, I would
[00:35:01] sporadically, I would do it. I wouldn't do it. And I, I'm speaking about this now again. This is
[00:35:05] a real estate podcast. We're talking about exercise. But I will tell you, the only thing that really
[00:35:12] ultimately got me to do it was eventually I just said, do I want to have more energy? Do I want
[00:35:18] to have more energy to do certain things in my life or stay up a little later to be able to do
[00:35:23] other things, spend time with my partner or, or, you know, explore hobbies or work on my business.
[00:35:31] I am going to need to have more energy than I currently have. And the only way I knew to get
[00:35:35] more energy was to work out. And I thought, well, that's a bummer. And that means I have to, you know,
[00:35:41] really, I have to do some really hard things to, to get this result. But it worked out
[00:35:48] quite, quite well. And so now I have a routine as well. And I would really encourage everyone on
[00:35:55] the show. Again, I'm not here to tell you to how to exercise or what to do. But if you are struggling
[00:36:02] with having the energy to do enough stuff, exercise will really help you out. And if nothing else,
[00:36:10] it'll help alleviate some stress and pressure along the way too. So I still have stress and pressure.
[00:36:16] Still have problems in my life is in no way perfect. But
[00:36:21] when you say workout, it you don't actually, you know, it's just a matter of, you know, at a certain
[00:36:26] time, just step out the door with those shoes on and you're doing it. That's exactly right. And,
[00:36:31] you know, and I sometimes I, you know, I don't get to the gym and I just go for a walk, but I tell
[00:36:36] myself, even if I just walk down the block and back, you clear your head a little bit. I have had a
[00:36:41] lot of beautiful seawall just down from where I am. And, you know, I start walking on that seawall. And
[00:36:48] the whole way to the next little village, I am wrapped up in my head with all the things that
[00:36:53] are swirling. But usually by the time I'm sort of halfway back, I realize that things have started
[00:36:59] to fall off a little bit and that you're actually a little bit clearer. Yeah, just taking a walk
[00:37:05] is very, very helpful because what we're really talking about is like priming the mind so that it
[00:37:12] can be useful when it's needed. So clearing your mind, meditating, doing exercise, or whatever helps,
[00:37:21] you know, reduce activation is really important because then we can take that energy that we've sort
[00:37:26] of captured and and harnessed and then actually apply it to whatever the activity is for the day.
[00:37:34] So it's no fun if you're anxious to then pick up the phone and start calling people. That's like
[00:37:40] the worst time to call people is if you're scared. So you want to get to a place where you're not
[00:37:45] scared. So you want to get rid of that fear and it's not just ignore it. It's like, well, okay,
[00:37:50] let's just let's get it out. Whatever the fear is, let's let's process it and let's get you back
[00:37:55] to center. And now let's tackle our day. I mean, I have fear too. Like, and we don't talk about fear
[00:38:01] enough, I think as REALTOR. We all are afraid. Everyone's got fear. It happens all the time.
[00:38:08] And the question isn't how do I avoid fear. The question is how do I cope with it? So I always think
[00:38:14] for me, if something is scary and healthy for me, then it's probably a good idea. And all I have to
[00:38:22] have is just sum it up the courage to do it. And it'll probably work out in the way that it should.
[00:38:29] Now again, I'm sort of speaking generally here and a little bit sort of esoterically. But
[00:38:34] but the point is is that what we really ultimately want to do in life is be able to do our job
[00:38:42] effectively or more effectively than maybe we had been before. And that requires really priming
[00:38:48] oneself, like getting oneself in alignment so that you do have the energy to do the things you want.
[00:38:54] So, okay, if I want to have the energy to make a certain amount of calls, which would net me a
[00:38:59] certain amount of income, I need to go to bed at a certain time. I need to exercise a certain
[00:39:04] amount per week. I need to eat a certain way. And it doesn't have to be perfect. But it's got to be,
[00:39:09] you know, pretty dialed in. And I have to then also look, okay, well, you know, what other parts
[00:39:15] of my life am I neglecting? Because I want to make sure all of my life is, is, you know, doing well.
[00:39:20] So, I always say, you know, start, start at the beginning of whatever, whatever the, like,
[00:39:27] for example, when I started realizing that if I just got an extra hour of sleep at night,
[00:39:33] my whole day changed, like as a, not, you know, I had more energy. I was like, oh, that's cool to know.
[00:39:39] So now, I mean, I don't always get enough sleep at the last night I didn't. But, but my,
[00:39:45] I know that if I get an extra hour of sleep, I'm probably going to be able to work longer
[00:39:50] the following day. And so this cause an effect thing. I know it's kind of simple, but I think often
[00:39:56] can, can be the elusive obvious is like, we look for like, where's the next lead? It's like, okay,
[00:40:02] did you sleep enough last night? Because if you're out looking for leads, I won't you fully
[00:40:07] rested. Because if you're going up to somebody and you're not at your best, that's not going to
[00:40:12] project well when you talk to them, when you communicate with them. We want you at your best. So,
[00:40:17] we need to take care of ourselves and do things for us so that we can, anyway, I'm going off on
[00:40:23] a bit of a tangent. No, I mean, I agree with you. And it doesn't, and it doesn't have to be a workout.
[00:40:26] We talked about the fact that we're both tennis fans. So, and for me, I play tennis three or four
[00:40:32] times a week and I play doubles. So if you don't show up, you're letting down three people. So you show up.
[00:40:39] And it's structured because we have to book a court and you're showing up. And that is structure.
[00:40:44] And when I have gone away or in the summer, like right now, a few of our people in our normal
[00:40:50] groups aren't around and we're not playing as much. And I feel it. I feel this sort of
[00:40:56] malaysie laziness that creeps in. I love that structure. Like, we're trying to get, we're trying
[00:41:02] to find a fourth person for 7.30 a.m. tomorrow morning. We always play on Friday mornings. And
[00:41:07] we're trying to find someone and we can't find anyone. Have you found clientele through
[00:41:14] the passion of tennis? Has that ever happened?
[00:41:18] It has. Yes, it has. I must also say the tennis club that I belong to. There's a lot of
[00:41:24] REALTORS that belong to that tennis club. So, you know, there's a lot of people top of mind there.
[00:41:31] But yeah, it's a great community of people. That's for sure. And, you know, so yeah, it does, but,
[00:41:39] you know, it would be great to have more of that.
[00:41:41] So, one last question about if you were to be mentoring, let's say a new agent came to you and
[00:41:48] said, I'm brand new. I just got my license. What do I do? What might you suggest to them?
[00:41:55] As I said, learn, take every opportunity to learn. Any, you know, seminars, what your brokerage
[00:42:03] offers, look at new technologies, every time you listen even to, you know, a podcast.
[00:42:11] You're not, you're not absorbing everything from one thing. You're never going to get everything
[00:42:16] from one place. But you pick up small nuggets and you just absorb as much as you can. And every
[00:42:24] talk you go to, there'll only be one or two small things that will resonate with you because there's
[00:42:30] so many places to go. And so, you know, just being open as open as you can to learn as much as you
[00:42:38] can in the beginning and go to the office. Go to the office. You know, we're at our office, we're
[00:42:44] trying to get people back to the office. I have an office and we're just trying to get people back
[00:42:50] in. It's such an energizer. It's, you get to hear what's going on because in the beginning,
[00:42:56] you're so isolated. You think you're alone in the silo and everybody else is doing stuff and I'm
[00:43:02] not doing stuff and I don't even, you know, and you're looking at the stats and what's selling every
[00:43:06] day. But how does that actually work in the real world? When you go into the office, you hear about
[00:43:12] how that deal came together or didn't come together. I think being in the office and hearing what
[00:43:18] what everybody else is doing is really valuable, you know, just. 100% agree. Yeah, we,
[00:43:24] most of our agents don't come in either and we, I would love it if they worked. Oh, well,
[00:43:31] we'd have to have a much bigger office. But yes, I 100% agree for me personally. I do not work well
[00:43:38] at home and I'm fortunate enough to have a place to go every day because it's the accountability
[00:43:44] thing for me. Like if I get here, I'm going to work. If I'm at home, I don't know, I might watch TV,
[00:43:51] I might do other things. I actually sometimes decide that just does need to be done instead of work.
[00:43:57] Sure. Or dusting. I'm like, oh, that's dusty. I should get to that. I'm like, no, no, no,
[00:44:02] I got to get out of here. Right. Yeah, there's always unfinished projects at home too. So that's
[00:44:07] the other thing about working at home is you start looking around and you're like, maybe I could
[00:44:12] start on this or that. So yeah, I'm a big fan of get out, clear your mind, maybe go to an office
[00:44:19] if you have one or go somewhere that's your dedicated workspace and just get to work. And the good
[00:44:26] news about this industry is number one, everyone's got to live somewhere. So they're going to most
[00:44:31] likely need a REALTOR and really the way that I've seen successful agents over the years build their
[00:44:37] business is really by demonstrating compassion care and competency, of course. So it's like,
[00:44:44] you learn your market, learn how to satisfy the needs of your clients and demonstrate that you
[00:44:53] care about them in as much many different ways as you can. And I think as a real estate agent,
[00:44:59] we're really lucky because clients will come to us with all sorts of questions and they need help
[00:45:06] or they need referrals or they need guidance. And that's where we can be really of value in between
[00:45:13] the sales. And so that hopefully, they will think about us on that next sale. Does that happen
[00:45:20] for you a lot where you're trying to stay in communication with your clients in between sales?
[00:45:25] Absolutely. I mean, that's the main thing to do when you know, you've, I mean, we all have those
[00:45:31] periods where we had a bunch of listings and when those are all on your mind and you're just so
[00:45:36] wrapped up and and then you have that elation because things have been wrapped up and then,
[00:45:42] now what? That's interesting. Summers come along and of course, I'm sure everywhere this year has been
[00:45:49] particularly tough. I know I'm here in Canada, real estate market's been very difficult.
[00:45:55] So, you know, at any point where you have sort of that that small, you have to be doing it all
[00:45:59] the time, but that's a really great place to just put focus because you need to have to feel like
[00:46:05] you have focus all the time. Of on something, if it's, you know, if it's your listings or your buyers,
[00:46:10] that's great when you have that, but when you have those small moments, you need to fill that with
[00:46:15] stuff that keeps you energized. And I find for me, the creative part of the Instagram and those
[00:46:22] things is part of that. It gives me that creative outlet where I feel like I'm still connecting with
[00:46:28] people and of course, on the personal level as well. You know, so it's, you know, it's a matter of
[00:46:33] keeping your self energized. That's your job. That's true. That's a really good point.
[00:46:41] You definitely have to keep yourself maybe back to the exercise thing too. Like keep yourself
[00:46:45] energized through taking care of your physical body as well. And I put a lot of energy into my
[00:46:52] clients too. I mean, I think I noticed in your, you know, in some of the questions that you
[00:46:58] put out that you might ask, you know, it's what, you know, what funny things happen in real estate.
[00:47:03] Well, you know, with my clients, I think a lot of funny things happen. And not just because they're
[00:47:07] funny is because that's sort of how I roll. You know, we, you know, we get to know each other.
[00:47:15] We are relaxed. We try to, you know, I try to have very open and transparent with my clients.
[00:47:21] And, you know, and ultimately that creates, you know, I don't like, you know, it sounds funny to
[00:47:31] say a fun journey, but it is. You know, we have a good time. We, you know, I make sure I give them all
[00:47:38] the information. They're informed, but you know, it's a relaxed atmosphere. And I think, you know,
[00:47:43] connecting with your clients in that way and then feeling that comfort with you is really important.
[00:47:49] And so our funny moments are all the time because, you know, I think that's perfectly stated.
[00:47:55] And one last question, if you could go back to yourself as nine years ago when you got your license,
[00:48:04] what would you tell yourself to do differently if you had to do it all over again?
[00:48:14] I think whatever, you know, I don't know. I feel like I learned so much. No, I don't know what I would
[00:48:24] do differently. I think, I don't know if I would really do much differently. I just had to, I felt like I,
[00:48:32] I did the journey, how I needed it to be. I remember sitting in the office the first time I sat
[00:48:38] down and I met a woman and I said, oh, how long have you been, you know, she said, oh, five years,
[00:48:42] I basically now feel like I know what I'm doing. I'm like, oh my god, okay, five years. That's a long
[00:48:47] time. But I remember feeling around that five year mark going, oh my god, I think I know what she's
[00:48:52] talking about. I think it all just settled in. And so from that perspective, my journey for me,
[00:48:58] I think was okay. I think at that point, focusing a little bit too much on print advertising,
[00:49:05] because that was when a big switch was happening, you know, and thinking that you've got to have your
[00:49:10] face in papers and magazines and all that stuff, but at that time, you know, that was old thinking
[00:49:16] and that transition was happening. So I probably spent some money and shouldn't spend. That will
[00:49:22] be one thing. And controlling your costs is important. So you don't have the stress. Yes,
[00:49:27] controlling your costs. That's a great piece of advice for new agents. That is a great piece of
[00:49:32] advice. Well, Juliet, thank you so, so much for coming on. I really loved hearing your story and

My conversation with top producer Julia Stover. Today, our guest is Julia Stover with McDonald Realty in beautiful Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, of course. Let me tell you more about Julia. Now Julia is an award-winning agent with McDonald Realty in beautiful West Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. She fell into the insurance industry at a young age, but she never felt quite right there. I bet a lot of people who jump in to insurance early on probably don't my dad say the same thing didn't feel quite right. She was always the more out there person at the insurance aid, the insurance company, but 25 years later when her daughter was headed for university, full of inspiration, she promised herself she would have a new career by her 50th birthday. She made the change carefully and nine years later, as a REALTOR has never looked back. Through crafting great connections and building relationships, she's created a business that she loves, combines her attention to detail and business background with her love of marketing and creativity. I want everybody to follow Julia on Instagram, which you can find her Julia Stoffer.ca. We will have a link to that in the show notes. It's st-a-u-f-f-e-r.ca. So Julia Stoffer.ca. And also that's her website as well. Julia Stoffer.ca. And I really encourage you to take a look at her website. I particularly like the design and look of it. Julia, thanks for being on the show. Hi DJ, thanks very much for having me. I just kicked my table, that's awesome. Well, yeah, I knock things all over all the time here and guests probably are like, what's that big loud crashing sound? And I usually don't even address it. I just kind of plow forward. But I'm excited because I think so many people get into real estate as a second career or an alternative career or they start in real estate as a part-time agent when they're doing something else and they eventually transition. But I love that you sort of had a clean break and at 50. So tell us that story. How did you get into real estate? Well, yeah. So as you said in my little introduction there, yes, a lot of people fall into, I was one of those people in high school who just, we're leaving high school, oh my gosh, what do you want to do when you grow up? I have no idea. And so when you don't have any plan in your head, you just sort of end up falling. And that's what I ended up doing. So through mutual connections, I fell into the insurance industry. And in the beginning of my insurance industry, I actually fell into like road service, auto driving around. We had a little territory with another gal. And it was very much, you know, I sort of felt it wasn't real insurance. Like it was just kind of fun. And when you're 20, right? And you know, we had salespeople, we had to keep happy. And you know, it was, it was a very fun and we got to do whatever we wanted. And so that was really fun. And you know, in your early 20s, that was a great, you know, great, it was a great career. And we could, then we make a money. I was totally on commission at that point. So it was, you know, that was, that was my intro to sort of business. But, you know, we got a little bit older. We were going to get married. And I thought, you know, if I'm going to be in this insurance thing, I better get into some real insurance. So, you know, get into an office, do some personal insurance. I go learn real insurance. But around that time, we got married in the next year. And I never went back to work full time after that. So my daughter was born, and I worked three, four days a week. And, you know, went from personal insurance and then ended up in one of the biggest insurance brokers in the world, actually, doing commercial insurance with really large mining companies or Vancouver's, I really had quarters from mining in the world, actually, and worked with some massive companies. And it was really, I enjoyed the people that I worked with. But the business, every time I tried to, you know, I worked with some of the top people in as sort of the helping backstage person. But I would always take me to meetings, because I was good with people. And, but it was when, you know, some younger people came in and they wanted me to do just a spreadsheet. So not go to the meeting. I'm like, oh, I'm not very good at those spreadsheets. I prefer the, the contract. So, you know, so I started realizing as my daughter was, you know, heading toward leaving high school and going to university. She was making all these plans. And I thought, you know, what? I think, you know, if I'm going to make a leap, I've got a planet now. And it's got to be, you know, I don't want to have that cake at my desk at the real estate, at the insurance office. I need to be somewhere else by the time that happens. So, so that was, that was the plan. And, you know, the question, you know, real estate, I mean, obviously everybody, especially Vancouver, real estate is something that everyone's interested in. It's, you know, you know, it's a fun industry, obviously. And so it was something that had always been in the back of my mind. I'd done sort of creative things. I actually took a broadcast journalism course when I was about 28. So, you know, creativity and that sort of thing was always, I'd always sort of looked for little paths to try to break out. But, you know, insurance is a, is a very stable, well-paying career. And, you know, it's hard to break out, that's for sure. So, yeah, you sure. But, you know, it's been sort of looking for these little avenues to sort of have these little creative outlets. So, well, it's interesting because you really went from a steady income to, you know, an unsteady income, right, in real estate. And, and that is a, it takes a tremendous amount of courage. I know, obviously, a lot of our listeners have taken that plunge as well. And, it's a tough one. I actually did navigate two years of part because I was working part-time. I was only working three days a week. And so, I was able to, when I first started. So, I was showing up on the days I wasn't at work at the office. And then everyone was leaving the office. And I was coming into the office because I was 5 o'clock. And so, I did navigate a couple of years of that. But, it was, yeah. But, I loved it. So, people are, you know, people I worked with were saying, well, you know, aren't you tired? Like, you're working here. And then you're working there. I'm like, oh, yeah, but you don't understand that work doesn't feel like work. You know, because you get to do it at your own pace. And the office, I always felt like I was in the office. And I was biting, I was getting paid by the hour. Like, you're, it's the time you spend. Not, not working on something that you just work, work, work, work, work through it. And then you cut to the other side. There was something so satisfying about the process and real estate that you were. Well, let's talk about that. So, so you got your license. You, you had been working training. And, and how did you go about starting to shift, you know, the people in your life who, hopefully, would ultimately end up, you know, using you or at least recommending you to people. How did you start to transition people to start seeing you as as the commercial insurance, you know, person over to real estate? Yeah. I mean, a lot of people that I worked with, you know, all was saw me as sort of the very sort of a little bit more out there. So when I started doing that, people like, oh, that makes sense for you to do something like that. I mean, it just made sense. So a lot of people that I worked with were really happy for me and sort of supported me, not necessarily in transactions right away. I've got to say that transitioning at 50 is a difficult time to use your sphere because most people that you know, it's not like in your 20s. They're already in their forever home. That's right. They're they haven't bought, they're not buying their first condo. They're not, you know, everybody's sort of in a place where it's difficult. So your own sphere is very difficult. But a lot of support as far as, you know, joining me on social media following me, all of those sorts of things, they were very, very supportive in that way. I was very lucky that my brother was all as in the branding space. So he was able to help me sort of get my name plate together, get my website, not when I have now, but my original website together and really kind of gave me a really good look and feel that I was comfortable with. So I didn't have to struggle with that, which is I know that something that agents really struggle with in the beginning, like having a uniform look and identity. So I was really lucky from that perspective that my brother sort of helps me have something clean to start with and I could run with that. So yeah, so and you know, landing at the right brokerage, that is key, right? So I'd come from an insurance industry, very male dominated. And in NBC right before I decided to take the realistic course, it went from a one month, do it yourself course, to a very long process actually, like I, you know, nine months, I think where you have to do all sorts of steps and it changed right before I decided to do it, which was quite interesting. But yeah, so then you get to the other side and now what, where am I going to go? So I've got this list of all the brokerages that I'm going to have to visit to figure out where I'm going to land because that's so important, try it. Yeah, and a lot of agents really, probably to their detriment, just go with the first brokerage that they talk to, right? Because it can be, it can be very exciting, you know, I just passed my exam, I want to, you know, get into it and then they find out, you know, six months down the road, ooh, there's other other opportunities. So, well, it's funny you should say that actually because I was drawn to McDonald Realty for some reason. There was a video and the director of our agent development who's been with McDonald Realty for over, over 25 years on Mark Bochoret, maybe if I'm wrong on that. He had a video on there about joining McDonald Realty and he's British and I have that British background and I immediately connected with that and I thought it's also an independent brokerage since 1944 in BC, you know, independent owned by a woman, it's now the biggest, biggest business in BC owned by a woman. Yeah, we have a, over 1100 agents and 20 offices now. Amazing. Yeah, so she bought the existing brokerage in the 90s and it was nice, so we're as celebrating 80 years now. And so I thought, oh, I like feel of that and so I called and got an appointment with Pat Place who is the managing broker in the Westman office and I sat down with her and we laughed our heads off for an hour and shouted and that was it. I had another one booked that afternoon and I canceled it. Actually, I knew I didn't know but it didn't go well. It didn't go well. You weren't laughing for a full hour. No, no, she, you know when you just really connect with someone. You know, you know when you know. You know when you know exactly. Yeah, it was just one of those moments where I thought, you know, this vibe of this woman when I've come from this sort of more male dominated kind of industry, I thought, oh, this is, this is where I belong. So you had some help around branding and marketing with family members, then you know, you got your license, you got a great brokerage to join. And then how did you go about building your business? What was it like? How was it going out and finding clients? Do you have any, you remember those days that nine years ago and how did you start prospecting? Mainly, mainly it was through connections with referrals and that continues to be a very big part of my business for sure. You know, it's that first person that connects you with one person that connects you with the next one. We also have a lot of connections. I've met some people that had connections in the mortgage industry. So I had some referrals through that. And just one thing led to another in that way. You know, everybody tries everything at that point, right? So now someone in my building is doing a renovation. So you can probably hear a drill right now. But yeah, so, you know, Dornahi tried it. Wow. Wow. Yeah, it's, that's, that's an interesting thing to do. I, yeah, not something for me. Yeah, very difficult. You can knock on one door and there's nobody there and then you get all excited and to try to the next one and there's nobody there. And then it's a very draining sort of thing to do. Absolutely. And I think, you know, we're a very saturated market with REALTORS here in North Vancouver, Vancouver, really. So it's not really somewhere where people really appreciate that. I mean, nine years ago, maybe, but not so much. And we also have a big glut of foreign buyers. And there were a lot of homes that weren't really occupied. So it wasn't like a neighborhood where, you know, you were just folksy with everybody. It's, it's a big city, small city, you know, so, yeah, very different in that way. So definitely. And also, you know, like you have, you know, resources, McDonald Rios, so agent friendly and trying to, you know, ensure agent success. And that was where we had the, I had the connection with Mark Winter, who's the agent development director. And, you know, taking advantage of everything that the brokerage offered as far as, you know, how, you know, connecting with people and, and, you know, and the next steps in the journey and really just making sure that you were really taking care of people and connecting with people. Yeah, I think the connection is really, it doesn't really get talked about as much. You know, we're talking about really building a business by referral and how do we do that? Well, you have to know a lot of people if you're going to do that. And in order to know a lot of people, you have to meet a lot of people and then you have to develop relationships with them and then deepen those relationships. Right? So it's a process, but I think it's the, I think ultimately it's the easiest path or rather the gentlest path because it's rocky at first because these are people that may or may not need your services for years and years. And you sort of as an agent are waiting, hopefully eagerly in the wings, but providing value along, along the way so that when they are ready, of course, that they pick up the phone and contact you. And but it all starts with beating people. And I always said like, I learned this from a business seminar that I was at like 20 years ago. It was just blew my mind and it's so silly, but it it it's going to sound silly, but it it really blew my mind. It's like if you would have double your income, double your leads. And I was like, Oh, yeah, that makes sense. Well, how do I do that? Well, I'd have to meet twice as many people as I already have. And if I assume the same, you know, ratios as far as meeting to actual clothes, whatever those, you know, as they funnel through, if I just meet twice as many people, theory, I should have twice as much business. And again, it's a really simple way to look at it, but it is true. So I wanted to talk a little bit about your network and how do you engage with your network, your sphere of influence, how do you stay on stay front of mind? And how do you stay in communication? Well, this this sort of leads into my, you know, love of creativity and doing these things. I jumped into so nine years ago. I mean, Facebook was sort of the one to start on. And I was comfortable using that. I actually helped my sister-in-law prior to that building a skincare brand. And my brother was also helping us with marketing. So we jumped into Facebook fairly quickly. So I was quite comfortable with that platform. And that's sort of where you started sort of building something. And and then from that, you know, it's a matter of a building out who you're talking to. And that over time, then you jump to Instagram. And so that's sort of where I got the connection of wanting to do more. I was always, I always had the good look of how things came together. I felt comfortable speaking. But video is something that obviously, you know, is really for right now. So that sort of, I was doing it. And I was feeling okay with it. But really, it wasn't till I heard Kim Riffurg on your podcast that I decided to really jump into the video space. And not just video as far as, you know, I mean, everyone's doing walking around homes and zooming around. You know, it's not that. It's more about the connection piece, right? So it's the connection of those people, yes, your top of mind because of whatever you're selling at the moment. But there's all there's value in even if they're not interested in that home or that area, there's value in learning about you. And I must say here in BC, we've had so many, well, we've had regulatory changes, not like the big regulatory changes that you've had there in the US, but but in BC housing is a big issue and there's been a lot of regulatory changes, especially even with the real estate business. When I got into the business in 2015, it was a little bit more of the Wild West than it had, you know, then when I actually got in, a lot of new things came in at that time and a lot of agents were going, oh my god, you know, we're being heavily regulated. And I'd come from 25 years in the insurance industry, which is very regulated. And so that didn't phase me. I didn't have any, you know, problem with that. You know, and it was new to me. So change is easy when you're not stuck in an old habit, right? Yeah. So, you know, so from the changes that we've had to go through, you know, communicating those changes to the public. So they understand, because the media when things change, they're all, oh, this scary thing is happening. Sure. Real tears are terrible people and they have to do this and they have to do that. Not understanding that it's the industry needing to change because it's a different world than it was 25 years ago, right? So yeah, I agree. So yeah, we're going through here in the US obviously a lot of change right now. You know, we are literally, well, we were at the precipice and we just crossed over and we're now going to see what happens. But it's ultimately, I think I think it'll be a good thing for our industry. I hope I'm not totally sure yet what we'll shake out. But what I do know is the top agents I've talked to seem to think, you know, this what will be good for the industry now is the agents who really take it seriously and really this is their, you know, the best agents will thrive. And maybe the weaker agents won't and maybe they'll wither and go away. And that means more market share for the top agents. And so I think this is like a great time to sharpen skills. So you talked about video. Let's talk about video. So this is a newer thing for you. How do you approach content video content for your sphere? So with, yeah, I mean, and that's a big part of it too. You know, people think, well, you're going on Instagram and doing these videos to try to, you know, obviously it's great if you're capturing leans that are just out of the blue. And but mainly it is keeping top of mind. It's people that you are connected with in the periphery and making sure that they they they really understand your value and you are the one they reach out to. So it's, it's, you know, really a combination of the personal and the educational piece and then of course your neighborhood and you're, you know, where you work. So it's a matter of, you know, location, personality and education are the pieces that I've. So when you're doing, when you're doing videos, are you doing short form videos like a minute or two? Are they longer form? Like what works best for you? Um, they're usually, yeah, usually in, you know, no more than three minutes or so. You know, um, there are, you know, obviously when you're, you know, if you have a listing and you're doing something a little bit longer, there's sometimes that falls into it. But most of it is shorter. YouTube is a channel. I haven't really put enough content there. And that's part of what you're learning is, you know, to figure out where your audience is. So where, where is best for you to put your content? Um, I think LinkedIn can be very valuable. If you have a lot of business connections, I think, you know, that that's the very, that's somewhere where you can really establish your credibility. LinkedIn is important for that because I think people will see you in, in the Facebook and Instagram. But, you know, if they're a business person, they'll probably check you out on LinkedIn, right? You know, that, that's a really great point that doesn't get brought up enough with my guests. And I, LinkedIn never gets talked about. So I'm glad that we're talking about it now because it is kind of the forgotten social media channel. Um, we, we, no, people don't go to LinkedIn for fun. Maybe I think fun is Facebook and Instagram. But they go to LinkedIn to see what's going on. And, um, they might not be fun, but it might be, but it's interesting. And so, and, and again, LinkedIn is fun as well. But I think there's a large untapped potential because we don't think about, um, LinkedIn as something that, that we're perusing, that the average consumer's perusing every day. But anyone who's in business is probably on LinkedIn way more than you think. And I think that's a huge opportunity. I mean, we stream this podcast to LinkedIn. And we get lots of attention there. And I never would have guessed that before a starting this. So, what, what I do, I recommend for video for, um, people who are listening, of course, is yeah, you know, put content on LinkedIn as well. It's, it's a great place, you know, maybe make the content a little bit more professional or post content that is more professional there. And, uh, a little bit more buttoned up, maybe. And then you can be a little sillier, I think, with the, uh, YouTube. Absolutely. And, and also Instagram and Facebook and TikTok, of course, too. Um, so, I don't think it's necessarily where you sell a property. It's more where you establish your credibility. Yes. I think that's, I think that's fair. And, and I think the, the thing that we also should always be mindful of is everybody's going to Google you. No matter, yeah, no matter, you know, how long you've been in the business, how many awards or, or non-awards you have, they're going to do a quick search just to, you know, people do that. And it's really important to have a good sense of what comes up. You know, everybody should Google themselves and, and get a sense of like what's showing up. And, and is this the sort of brand I want to, I want to project. I want to go back to your brand, um, because you, you had some help around branding and a lot of people really don't get that help. Tell us what your brand is and how you sort of arrived at that. Um, it was more just wanting to have just a clean look. I wanted to have, you know, everybody wants to have your name plate. So it's very clear. Um, I wanted to be just straight forward. I actually never even got a headshot done. I, I had a photo. Seems ridiculous. It seems really, I just got my first headshot done a month ago. I have been using a photo from a, a, a Christmas party, um, which I just really liked the, like, just how I felt I came across. And I think that's really what you're looking for. Because taking a photo is, you know, an unnatural experience. And I felt I just had something that worked. I said to friends, I said, is this, is it wrong for me to do that? I know this is really strange. But what do you think? And they're like, no, that, that's you when you're at your best connecting with people and happy and engaged. I'm like, okay, because if I now go and try to get a headshot, I know, you know, and now I'm confident in who I am as a REALTOR. And I can get a photo taken because I feel, you know, in the beginning, you're like, well, who am I? And I'm like, you know, got you, you know, everybody's got the hands crossed pose and all of those things. And it's sort of like, no, I, I, I don't want to do that right now. I need to be me, whoever I am at that point in time. And, and that's sort of what I ran with. So I think it was, you know, maybe, maybe people felt that authenticity, the ease, maybe, yeah. Absolutely. Yeah. I think, I think that's true. Like, there's a particular push these days for style where headshots maybe aren't as invogue as they used to be where it's more now photographs, photography capturing somebody doing something. Right. I think sort of like catching them doing something that they're passionate about. Yeah. Is, is always more interesting to me because then I get to learn a little bit about the person inside of that photo. Right. So if anyone out there is listening and has a look, everyone probably has a headshot, there's nothing wrong with headshots are great. They're useful. And I would also encourage you to have, you know, get some action shots of you doing, you know, whether it's real estate activities or non real estate activities, whatever someone's passionate about, we want to connect consumers want to connect with their agent. They want to know what does their agent do? What is it? What is their agent into? And that would be a great place to do that. I, I wanted to, you're a very creative person. I wanted to talk about creativity and how that has played into your business. Can you give us some examples of how you've used creativity to build your business? I think obviously, you know, creating your own content, you know, everybody plays around with in the beginning, whether you get someone else to do stuff for you or you do it yourself or, you know, you know, you know, and you can, and you can you do it yourself. Not everybody has that creative bench, right. You'd like to not pay someone to do it, but you're not that comfortable doing it yourself. So from my perspective, luckily, I enjoyed the process of using different programs to create content. Obviously, that can be a little bit of a runaway train time wise because you, you're perfecting and you want to change things and you've always want to, you see a new thing that you can use and you're sort of wanting to use every new tool that comes along. But so yeah, I, I, I really enjoy that piece of the process and so I do like to develop my own things, but I've also always taken, taken courses. I'm a, my daughter calls me the self-help, you know, queen because every book, not so much books. I don't, I don't read. I know it sounds terrible. I don't read novels and when I did read, it was always self-help books. I, something or autobiographies. Now I have Audible, so I don't even actually have to read them. I used to skim them really, but Audible is doing really great. So, you know, I'm always picking up the next thing, you know, about how, you know, pushing forward and creativity and, and new things to do. So, so that part of it really excites me. I love that piece of it. You know, it's interesting. I didn't really thought of it too much until you just said this, but we've been doing the show many, many years. And one of the real key personality traits or characteristics that I've noticed, but I hadn't really congealed this thought until just now, is this sort of lifetime of learning attribute that seems to be very consistent among top performers. There's this willingness and excitement to sort of learn something new. And Emerson, you know, you talked about when you first got into your brokerage at McDonald, doing all of their training. I mean, as sort of rudimentary as that sounds, we have 800 agents at our company here. I can tell you, a lot of them have never come to training programs. And that's not to say that there's anything wrong with those people who haven't, maybe they're busy, they haven't. But as a result of not going through and continually learning, you know, their business is only going to grow at a certain percentage. And so it's funny. When I first, first, first got into this business, I asked a REALTOR in my hometown, who was one of the top REALTOR's there. I didn't know anything about real estate. I said, his name is Brian. I said, Brian, why are you like the number seven highest producing agent in Pioria, Illinois, have all places? And he goes, he looked at me and he goes, I cannot tell you other than, I'm usually the first one here in the morning. And he's like, I don't come at 6 a.m. He's like, I get here at 8 a.m. He goes, and I leave it like 6 p.m. You know, a pretty normal day. I answer my phone, I make my calls, like he was just like, you just do the thing. And and I go, well, there's more to it than that. He goes, well, yeah, but not really. He's like, it's really mostly that. Yeah, I mean, you just have to be showing up all the time and not, I don't mean on Instagram, Facebook. I mean, in life, right? And I'd come from going to an office every day. So, you know, I told myself actually that I was going to start going to the gym at seven in the morning because I wanted to make sure I kept up that routine of getting up early and being up and dressed and ready to roll at nine o'clock. You know, and you know, that's changed a little bit because real estate kind of slipped into. Maybe nine thirty, but basically, you know, I, you know, I don't, I'm ready to roll. If somebody called, I'd be ready anytime to go somewhere at nine o'clock. Yeah. It's kind of how I am. Like, you know, I'm, I'm not in my jammies until 11 o'clock, even though I could be working because I don't have anywhere to go. But what if, what if someone calls and I need to go, I gotta be ready. Well, getting, look, getting in physical shape, I, you know, this has been a huge, I, a huge thing for me, a huge hurdle for me to, to get over. I, I really was not an exercise person up until about those, now I'm four years in. Prior to that, I would sporadically, I would do it. I wouldn't do it. And I, I'm speaking about this now again. This is a real estate podcast. We're talking about exercise. But I will tell you, the only thing that really ultimately got me to do it was eventually I just said, do I want to have more energy? Do I want to have more energy to do certain things in my life or stay up a little later to be able to do other things, spend time with my partner or, or, you know, explore hobbies or work on my business. I am going to need to have more energy than I currently have. And the only way I knew to get more energy was to work out. And I thought, well, that's a bummer. And that means I have to, you know, really, I have to do some really hard things to, to get this result. But it worked out quite, quite well. And so now I have a routine as well. And I would really encourage everyone on the show. Again, I'm not here to tell you to how to exercise or what to do. But if you are struggling with having the energy to do enough stuff, exercise will really help you out. And if nothing else, it'll help alleviate some stress and pressure along the way too. So I still have stress and pressure. Still have problems in my life is in no way perfect. But when you say workout, it you don't actually, you know, it's just a matter of, you know, at a certain time, just step out the door with those shoes on and you're doing it. That's exactly right. And, you know, and I sometimes I, you know, I don't get to the gym and I just go for a walk, but I tell myself, even if I just walk down the block and back, you clear your head a little bit. I have had a lot of beautiful seawall just down from where I am. And, you know, I start walking on that seawall. And the whole way to the next little village, I am wrapped up in my head with all the things that are swirling. But usually by the time I'm sort of halfway back, I realize that things have started to fall off a little bit and that you're actually a little bit clearer. Yeah, just taking a walk is very, very helpful because what we're really talking about is like priming the mind so that it can be useful when it's needed. So clearing your mind, meditating, doing exercise, or whatever helps, you know, reduce activation is really important because then we can take that energy that we've sort of captured and and harnessed and then actually apply it to whatever the activity is for the day. So it's no fun if you're anxious to then pick up the phone and start calling people. That's like the worst time to call people is if you're scared. So you want to get to a place where you're not scared. So you want to get rid of that fear and it's not just ignore it. It's like, well, okay, let's just let's get it out. Whatever the fear is, let's let's process it and let's get you back to center. And now let's tackle our day. I mean, I have fear too. Like, and we don't talk about fear enough, I think as REALTOR. We all are afraid. Everyone's got fear. It happens all the time. And the question isn't how do I avoid fear. The question is how do I cope with it? So I always think for me, if something is scary and healthy for me, then it's probably a good idea. And all I have to have is just sum it up the courage to do it. And it'll probably work out in the way that it should. Now again, I'm sort of speaking generally here and a little bit sort of esoterically. But but the point is is that what we really ultimately want to do in life is be able to do our job effectively or more effectively than maybe we had been before. And that requires really priming oneself, like getting oneself in alignment so that you do have the energy to do the things you want. So, okay, if I want to have the energy to make a certain amount of calls, which would net me a certain amount of income, I need to go to bed at a certain time. I need to exercise a certain amount per week. I need to eat a certain way. And it doesn't have to be perfect. But it's got to be, you know, pretty dialed in. And I have to then also look, okay, well, you know, what other parts of my life am I neglecting? Because I want to make sure all of my life is, is, you know, doing well. So, I always say, you know, start, start at the beginning of whatever, whatever the, like, for example, when I started realizing that if I just got an extra hour of sleep at night, my whole day changed, like as a, not, you know, I had more energy. I was like, oh, that's cool to know. So now, I mean, I don't always get enough sleep at the last night I didn't. But, but my, I know that if I get an extra hour of sleep, I'm probably going to be able to work longer the following day. And so this cause an effect thing. I know it's kind of simple, but I think often can, can be the elusive obvious is like, we look for like, where's the next lead? It's like, okay, did you sleep enough last night? Because if you're out looking for leads, I won't you fully rested. Because if you're going up to somebody and you're not at your best, that's not going to project well when you talk to them, when you communicate with them. We want you at your best. So, we need to take care of ourselves and do things for us so that we can, anyway, I'm going off on a bit of a tangent. No, I mean, I agree with you. And it doesn't, and it doesn't have to be a workout. We talked about the fact that we're both tennis fans. So, and for me, I play tennis three or four times a week and I play doubles. So if you don't show up, you're letting down three people. So you show up. And it's structured because we have to book a court and you're showing up. And that is structure. And when I have gone away or in the summer, like right now, a few of our people in our normal groups aren't around and we're not playing as much. And I feel it. I feel this sort of malaysie laziness that creeps in. I love that structure. Like, we're trying to get, we're trying to find a fourth person for 7.30 a.m. tomorrow morning. We always play on Friday mornings. And we're trying to find someone and we can't find anyone. Have you found clientele through the passion of tennis? Has that ever happened? It has. Yes, it has. I must also say the tennis club that I belong to. There's a lot of REALTORS that belong to that tennis club. So, you know, there's a lot of people top of mind there. But yeah, it's a great community of people. That's for sure. And, you know, so yeah, it does, but, you know, it would be great to have more of that. So, one last question about if you were to be mentoring, let's say a new agent came to you and said, I'm brand new. I just got my license. What do I do? What might you suggest to them? As I said, learn, take every opportunity to learn. Any, you know, seminars, what your brokerage offers, look at new technologies, every time you listen even to, you know, a podcast. You're not, you're not absorbing everything from one thing. You're never going to get everything from one place. But you pick up small nuggets and you just absorb as much as you can. And every talk you go to, there'll only be one or two small things that will resonate with you because there's so many places to go. And so, you know, just being open as open as you can to learn as much as you can in the beginning and go to the office. Go to the office. You know, we're at our office, we're trying to get people back to the office. I have an office and we're just trying to get people back in. It's such an energizer. It's, you get to hear what's going on because in the beginning, you're so isolated. You think you're alone in the silo and everybody else is doing stuff and I'm not doing stuff and I don't even, you know, and you're looking at the stats and what's selling every day. But how does that actually work in the real world? When you go into the office, you hear about how that deal came together or didn't come together. I think being in the office and hearing what what everybody else is doing is really valuable, you know, just. 100% agree. Yeah, we, most of our agents don't come in either and we, I would love it if they worked. Oh, well, we'd have to have a much bigger office. But yes, I 100% agree for me personally. I do not work well at home and I'm fortunate enough to have a place to go every day because it's the accountability thing for me. Like if I get here, I'm going to work. If I'm at home, I don't know, I might watch TV, I might do other things. I actually sometimes decide that just does need to be done instead of work. Sure. Or dusting. I'm like, oh, that's dusty. I should get to that. I'm like, no, no, no, I got to get out of here. Right. Yeah, there's always unfinished projects at home too. So that's the other thing about working at home is you start looking around and you're like, maybe I could start on this or that. So yeah, I'm a big fan of get out, clear your mind, maybe go to an office if you have one or go somewhere that's your dedicated workspace and just get to work. And the good news about this industry is number one, everyone's got to live somewhere. So they're going to most likely need a REALTOR and really the way that I've seen successful agents over the years build their business is really by demonstrating compassion care and competency, of course. So it's like, you learn your market, learn how to satisfy the needs of your clients and demonstrate that you care about them in as much many different ways as you can. And I think as a real estate agent, we're really lucky because clients will come to us with all sorts of questions and they need help or they need referrals or they need guidance. And that's where we can be really of value in between the sales. And so that hopefully, they will think about us on that next sale. Does that happen for you a lot where you're trying to stay in communication with your clients in between sales? Absolutely. I mean, that's the main thing to do when you know, you've, I mean, we all have those periods where we had a bunch of listings and when those are all on your mind and you're just so wrapped up and and then you have that elation because things have been wrapped up and then, now what? That's interesting. Summers come along and of course, I'm sure everywhere this year has been particularly tough. I know I'm here in Canada, real estate market's been very difficult. So, you know, at any point where you have sort of that that small, you have to be doing it all the time, but that's a really great place to just put focus because you need to have to feel like you have focus all the time. Of on something, if it's, you know, if it's your listings or your buyers, that's great when you have that, but when you have those small moments, you need to fill that with stuff that keeps you energized. And I find for me, the creative part of the Instagram and those things is part of that. It gives me that creative outlet where I feel like I'm still connecting with people and of course, on the personal level as well. You know, so it's, you know, it's a matter of keeping your self energized. That's your job. That's true. That's a really good point. You definitely have to keep yourself maybe back to the exercise thing too. Like keep yourself energized through taking care of your physical body as well. And I put a lot of energy into my clients too. I mean, I think I noticed in your, you know, in some of the questions that you put out that you might ask, you know, it's what, you know, what funny things happen in real estate. Well, you know, with my clients, I think a lot of funny things happen. And not just because they're funny is because that's sort of how I roll. You know, we, you know, we get to know each other. We are relaxed. We try to, you know, I try to have very open and transparent with my clients. And, you know, and ultimately that creates, you know, I don't like, you know, it sounds funny to say a fun journey, but it is. You know, we have a good time. We, you know, I make sure I give them all the information. They're informed, but you know, it's a relaxed atmosphere. And I think, you know, connecting with your clients in that way and then feeling that comfort with you is really important. And so our funny moments are all the time because, you know, I think that's perfectly stated. And one last question, if you could go back to yourself as nine years ago when you got your license, what would you tell yourself to do differently if you had to do it all over again? I think whatever, you know, I don't know. I feel like I learned so much. No, I don't know what I would do differently. I think, I don't know if I would really do much differently. I just had to, I felt like I, I did the journey, how I needed it to be. I remember sitting in the office the first time I sat down and I met a woman and I said, oh, how long have you been, you know, she said, oh, five years, I basically now feel like I know what I'm doing. I'm like, oh my god, okay, five years. That's a long time. But I remember feeling around that five year mark going, oh my god, I think I know what she's talking about. I think it all just settled in. And so from that perspective, my journey for me, I think was okay. I think at that point, focusing a little bit too much on print advertising, because that was when a big switch was happening, you know, and thinking that you've got to have your face in papers and magazines and all that stuff, but at that time, you know, that was old thinking and that transition was happening. So I probably spent some money and shouldn't spend. That will be one thing. And controlling your costs is important. So you don't have the stress. Yes, controlling your costs. That's a great piece of advice for new agents. That is a great piece of advice. Well, Juliet, thank you so, so much for coming on.
