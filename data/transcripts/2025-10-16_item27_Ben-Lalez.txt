[00:01:17] Today's episode is brought to you by corded.io.
[00:01:20] Are you looking for agents to join your brokerage or team?
[00:01:24] Now, as a real estate recruiter, I can tell you the answer is always yes.
[00:01:28] But most agents aren't looking to move right now.
[00:01:31] So how do you know who to contact?
[00:01:33] Well, what if I were to tell you there's a recruiting and retention tool powered by artificial intelligence that shows you exactly which agents in your local market are looking to leave their brokerage right now?
[00:01:44] And which agents at your own firm are also looking to leave you.
[00:01:48] Now, I've been recruiting REALTORS for 15 years and I've hired over 2000 agents.
[00:01:54] I can tell you with no exaggeration, this is the tool I've been waiting for.
[00:01:58] Corded's AI looks for trends across dozens of variables for each agent in your market and shows you which agents they believe are likely to move.
[00:02:06] Not only does it do that, but corded's AI went and visited my recruiting website and read everything I offer.
[00:02:13] So now when I'm recruiting, corded's AI tells me exactly what to say based on that agent's needs and what my brokerage can offer.
[00:02:21] It even writes emails for me.
[00:02:23] I've never seen anything like it and I use it every single day.
[00:02:27] Now, if you are looking to grow your brokerage, corded.io is the best tool out there.
[00:02:32] Visit corded.io to schedule a demo again.
[00:02:35] That's corded.io.
[00:02:37] And now, onto the show.
[00:02:54] Welcome to Keeping It Real, the largest podcast made by real estate agents and for real estate agents.
[00:02:59] My name is DJ Paris.
[00:03:01] I'm your guide and host through the show today is our monthly series called Better Business with Ben with Ben Lala's.
[00:03:07] Ben Lala's is with Compass and he runs the Ben Lala's team.
[00:03:11] He's one of the top teams here in the Chicago land area does several hundred million dollars in sales every year.
[00:03:17] He and his team and he comes on every month very generously to talk about what he's doing to motivate his team to keep his team growing and also just advice in general to our audience.
[00:03:28] He's a big a long time listener and we are super honored to have him.
[00:03:33] Ben Lala's calm is where you go.
[00:03:35] Ben Lala's team is where you find him on Instagram.
[00:03:37] We will have links to that in the show notes.
[00:03:40] And I do encourage you to follow him on Instagram and Facebook be in LinkedIn because we're going to be talking about social media today.
[00:03:47] And I think you're going to be actually talking about what you do and it's nice that people can actually then absorb your content.
[00:03:54] So Ben Lala's team is where you find him.
[00:03:56] You can go to his website.
[00:03:57] All of his social is linked there as well.
[00:03:59] But Ben, welcome to Better Better Business with Ben.
[00:04:01] Yeah, I like a long, long time listener first time.
[00:04:05] It's not my first time.
[00:04:06] This is my 10th time probably on the show now.
[00:04:08] Yeah.
[00:04:09] Yeah, I love it.
[00:04:09] I'm excited to talk about social.
[00:04:12] And by no means like an influencer, no matter how hard I try.
[00:04:16] But I have a lot to share.
[00:04:20] Kind of like obviously the trajectory, my growth trajectory can be linked to social media.
[00:04:25] We should also set the stage that you as a team leader, which is not always the case.
[00:04:31] You actually do a lot of the content.
[00:04:34] You actually star in the content.
[00:04:35] You write the content.
[00:04:36] You have a team that is helping produce it.
[00:04:39] But you are actually creating a lot of content for your team.
[00:04:43] Yes, that's exactly right.
[00:04:44] Because I believe in it.
[00:04:45] And I believe it's the way that people want to be reached because it all starts with the
[00:04:50] audience.
[00:04:51] But let's backtrack for a second, DJ.
[00:04:54] Let me ask you a question.
[00:04:57] Before we get started, what is the best CRM?
[00:05:02] It's the one you're using.
[00:05:03] Yeah, it's the one you use.
[00:05:05] So as we talk to people about social media, any strategy is going to be better than
[00:05:13] no strategy.
[00:05:13] Anything that you are actually going to do and use is going to work better than just throwing
[00:05:23] something at the wall.
[00:05:24] Now we should also mention too that there are many different channels and ways to distribute
[00:05:28] social media content and really different strategies for each one of those channels.
[00:05:33] If you really wanted to do it effectively, so maybe you're also saying maybe don't choose
[00:05:39] all the social media channels to focus on.
[00:05:41] Maybe pick one or two.
[00:05:43] I'd probably even one.
[00:05:44] Where is my ideal audience hanging out is probably the question there.
[00:05:47] Yeah.
[00:05:47] And we're talking about social media.
[00:05:50] This is really, really broad.
[00:05:52] So the way I've looked at it is you kind of have like various stages.
[00:05:58] Let's call you DJ are very much an expert in social media.
[00:06:03] Thank you.
[00:06:03] You have a podcast.
[00:06:04] I don't know if you knew that on video, one of the largest real estate podcast platforms
[00:06:08] in the world, the country.
[00:06:10] And then you have amateur, someone who's never put out a video in their entire life, but
[00:06:14] I kind of want to link something very quickly.
[00:06:17] So let's go back in time.
[00:06:19] 2017.
[00:06:20] I was doing four million in sales.
[00:06:23] I had never put out a single video.
[00:06:26] Right.
[00:06:26] But in 2018, I put out 50 videos.
[00:06:32] And my sales went from four to 14.
[00:06:36] Then in 2019, I put out like 120-ish videos.
[00:06:41] And sales went from 14 to 23.
[00:06:44] And you saw direct correlation between the video content and the growth.
[00:06:48] So here's the problem with social media and kind of all marketing.
[00:06:51] You should probably know this.
[00:06:53] Sure.
[00:06:53] Now, it's impossible to draw a direct line from videos to actual sales.
[00:07:01] Unless you're getting that call, I just saw your video, which you probably rarely get
[00:07:05] that call.
[00:07:05] So I know exactly how many times I've gotten that call.
[00:07:08] Do you want to know how many?
[00:07:08] How many?
[00:07:09] I guess a dozen.
[00:07:12] Twelve.
[00:07:12] Yeah.
[00:07:13] So 12 times since 2017, it's, you know, 2025 right now.
[00:07:18] Hundreds of videos in your wake.
[00:07:20] Yeah.
[00:07:20] So maybe thousands.
[00:07:21] Four thousand videos to date now, right?
[00:07:25] So we cut them all.
[00:07:26] So you're not going to get the calls, what you say.
[00:07:28] So I've gotten that call and say, Hey, Ben, I just saw XYZ video.
[00:07:33] And I want you to be my real estate agent from I call that a stranger.
[00:07:36] Yeah.
[00:07:37] But you know what happens way more often is I'll give you an example.
[00:07:42] Okay.
[00:07:43] So one of my best friends, his name is David.
[00:07:45] Okay.
[00:07:47] David went to college.
[00:07:49] His college roommate was his name is Brad.
[00:07:52] So the way these algorithms work is they think if David likes Ben's content, let's
[00:07:58] serve some up to Brad.
[00:08:00] Pretty logical.
[00:08:01] Sure.
[00:08:01] Right?
[00:08:02] So Brad reaches out to David and asks, Hey, is your friend Ben legit?
[00:08:09] David being the good friend that he is says, yeah, Ben's the man, right?
[00:08:11] Or some variation of that.
[00:08:13] So now Brad has the confidence to reach out to me and introduce me to his mom, Ruth.
[00:08:22] Now is Ruth Brad's mom?
[00:08:25] Is she a stranger?
[00:08:26] Certainly.
[00:08:27] Right?
[00:08:27] But that's pretty close.
[00:08:29] It's my best friend's college roommate's mom.
[00:08:32] And we should mention that Ruth is not watching her content.
[00:08:35] No, I don't.
[00:08:36] I mean, Ruth has.
[00:08:37] Possibly, but she's likely.
[00:08:38] Well, I've talked about Ruth many times before.
[00:08:40] And neither Brad nor Ruth has ever reached out.
[00:08:44] Gotcha.
[00:08:44] And let me tell you what Ruth represents.
[00:08:46] So I helped Ruth sell her home in the suburbs by one in the city.
[00:08:53] And then she's referred me to friends both who whom have sold.
[00:08:56] And then they moved out of the moved out of the state.
[00:08:58] OK.
[00:08:59] So she's responsible for somewhere in the neighborhood of, I think it's like two, two
[00:09:04] and a half million dollars of total sales.
[00:09:06] It's like $40,000.
[00:09:07] Amazing.
[00:09:09] So I like to tell people that there's this, I call it a coin to term, the fallacy of the stranger,
[00:09:16] where everyone thinks that they're going after some random person that they have absolutely
[00:09:21] no connection to.
[00:09:23] And that's who they're trying to drive into their content.
[00:09:25] And I'm jealous of those people.
[00:09:27] You and I both know people that have made that happen.
[00:09:31] Yeah.
[00:09:31] And that path is usually done most, most often on YouTube.
[00:09:38] And that's a long play and it is a grind.
[00:09:41] It's a lot of work.
[00:09:42] And honestly, DJ, I'm trying my hardest.
[00:09:48] But listen, I know that I'm not Ryan Sirhant.
[00:09:51] Right.
[00:09:51] Right.
[00:09:52] I am a normal real estate agent in the city.
[00:09:55] But I also know that social media has become mandatory, not optional.
[00:10:02] And here's your first biggest tip.
[00:10:05] Can I curse on this?
[00:10:06] Sure.
[00:10:06] I can't.
[00:10:09] So every single time, this time included, I don't want to do this.
[00:10:12] I video has gotten so mundane for me.
[00:10:14] But you know what I tell myself?
[00:10:16] I write before this, I go, Ben, like, excuse me.
[00:10:21] Fuck your mood, Ben.
[00:10:22] It doesn't matter.
[00:10:23] You have to do this.
[00:10:24] The same way that you don't want to call call, you don't always have to be.
[00:10:30] I don't want to do push ups in the gym.
[00:10:31] Yeah, you don't always have to be in the mood to do social.
[00:10:34] But if you want to compete with the DJ parishes in the Ben Lallys of the world,
[00:10:38] you're going to have to.
[00:10:40] I'm sorry.
[00:10:41] I don't know what to tell you.
[00:10:42] That's a case.
[00:10:43] Yeah.
[00:10:44] So the question is, and I think for everyone, you know, depending on who you are,
[00:10:48] and I am going to go through if you're a beginner, intermediate, and expert,
[00:10:53] and what you can and should be doing.
[00:10:55] So you know, if you take a look at my content, if you're watching this right now,
[00:11:00] I am assuming some people are like, that's a lot.
[00:11:04] Podcasts set up, background, mics.
[00:11:07] We have one.
[00:11:07] Can we look at this camera together?
[00:11:09] One, two, three cameras.
[00:11:11] Three camera shoot.
[00:11:12] Yeah, this has got to be super intimidating.
[00:11:14] Yeah.
[00:11:15] Right?
[00:11:16] But if you are just getting started, you've never shot a video.
[00:11:21] Can we invite people to do it right now?
[00:11:23] Sure.
[00:11:25] Let's put some money on the line.
[00:11:26] Okay.
[00:11:27] If anyone listening gets out their phone and shoots something saying, hey, this is my
[00:11:33] first video.
[00:11:35] I want to thank Ben Lallys and DJ Paris for giving me the confidence to do this.
[00:11:40] If you're watching, I would love to be your real estate agent.
[00:11:43] Something in that vein will return the shot on.
[00:11:47] Absolutely.
[00:11:48] Deal.
[00:11:48] So someone who has like a new platform, I have X, thousand followers.
[00:11:54] You have thousands of followers.
[00:11:56] We'll repost it and we'll be that catalyst for you.
[00:11:59] Great.
[00:11:59] Is that a deal?
[00:12:00] Happy to do it.
[00:12:01] Yeah.
[00:12:01] So if you are an amateur, it doesn't require much.
[00:12:04] If you want to just get started, your phone is good enough.
[00:12:07] The problem is sometimes the audio isn't so good.
[00:12:11] Right.
[00:12:11] So if you're going to invest on Amazon, how much is one of a mic?
[00:12:15] A laugh mic?
[00:12:15] Yeah.
[00:12:16] Less than a hundred bucks.
[00:12:17] I think you could probably get one.
[00:12:20] Jeremy, how much is a cheap mic?
[00:12:23] It's probably about 50 bucks.
[00:12:25] Yeah.
[00:12:25] 
[00:12:26] And then all of a sudden you have really great sound.
[00:12:29] Now you're probably doing that for a long time and everyone has asked me like, when do
[00:12:35] you step up?
[00:12:37] Right.
[00:12:38] When did you?
[00:12:39] When did you?
[00:12:40] You didn't always have like some crazy setup.
[00:12:42] When did you have to 25 bucks as Jeremy?
[00:12:46] When did you level up and know that you needed to take your real estate game to the next
[00:12:51] hour?
[00:12:51] Yeah.
[00:12:51] So with my podcast, I had a $50 mic and a $100 board.
[00:12:57] And today I have a $400 mic and a $100 board.
[00:13:03] And staff.
[00:13:04] And yes.
[00:13:05] So staff is the big thing.
[00:13:07] Yeah.
[00:13:07] So when?
[00:13:08] When did you have to level up?
[00:13:11] It was at least two years.
[00:13:13] Two years in.
[00:13:14] Yeah.
[00:13:14] Yeah.
[00:13:15] So what I tell people and I did all the production.
[00:13:19] I did everything myself by yourself.
[00:13:21] And this was not my job.
[00:13:23] So it's pretty easy is when you don't have enough time is when you start upgrading,
[00:13:32] whether that's in software and people, et cetera.
[00:13:35] And that can usually be tied to sale.
[00:13:38] You'll know when it's that time.
[00:13:39] Yeah.
[00:13:39] So if you're out doing showings and you're making money and social media is a priority,
[00:13:45] that's when you start hiring people.
[00:13:47] Now, who do you hire first?
[00:13:49] How much money is it going to cost?
[00:13:51] Et cetera, is usually the next question.
[00:13:54] And God bless the day and age that we're in is there's a lot of digital creators out
[00:13:58] there.
[00:13:59] And there's a lot of digital platforms.
[00:14:01] AI is certainly something that needs to be talked about.
[00:14:03] But you could probably, and if you don't have someone reach out to us, you could probably
[00:14:09] get a videographer for a half day for how much?
[00:14:14] Oh, gosh.
[00:14:15] I don't know.
[00:14:16] I never get videographers.
[00:14:17] I think you could probably get a videographer for a half day for $250 to $400 here in Chicago.
[00:14:23] Pretty reasonable.
[00:14:24] And from there, depending on how hands on you want to be, right?
[00:14:27] So they're, again, the videographer will probably offer editing services so you can chop
[00:14:31] that up into X number of reals or short form content or edit it into long form.
[00:14:37] But in this day and age, depending, again, on how much work you want to do, you can find
[00:14:42] editors overseas or software that can chop up that long form into short form for you.
[00:14:49] Four hours of content, if you've already thought it out, plan it out.
[00:14:54] Can you yield 30 pieces of content, something like that?
[00:14:59] And congratulations, you have, I don't know, between eight and it could be the whole
[00:15:07] eight weeks and 50 weeks of content, depending on how much you want to spread.
[00:15:10] And what do you think we're paying for that editing?
[00:15:13] Editing can be very, very affordable, depending on the route you go.
[00:15:17] Yeah.
[00:15:17] The whole world can bid on this too.
[00:15:20] Yeah.
[00:15:20] And we've talked about this in previous episodes.
[00:15:24] You're familiar with Upwork.
[00:15:25] Sure.
[00:15:26] I use it all the time.
[00:15:26] Yeah.
[00:15:27] So we use Upwork religiously.
[00:15:29] And sometimes you get what you pay for, you have to do some research.
[00:15:33] It takes some time, right?
[00:15:35] And this is, it comes back to, if you want, can I pull, I'm going to plug it.
[00:15:39] If you want to jump all of the learning, you just come to a place like contentclubshakago.com,
[00:15:45] come to content club and they handle it for you, right?
[00:15:48] So you just sit down, they edit it, lighting sound, etc.
[00:15:53] But if you want to save some money and do it yourself, you can handle all of that stuff.
[00:15:58] Pretty reasonably, and your best friend, chat GPT, can probably coach you through exactly
[00:16:03] what those steps are.
[00:16:05] Yeah.
[00:16:05] And how to find the right people.
[00:16:07] Yeah.
[00:16:07] And, yeah.
[00:16:09] How many times have you failed on Upwork though?
[00:16:13] It's happened.
[00:16:14] Yeah.
[00:16:15] But more often than not, I get people that are really, I know, I know what to look for.
[00:16:20] Now you know it.
[00:16:21] Now you know it.
[00:16:21] There's a bit of a learning curve.
[00:16:22] Yeah.
[00:16:23] So if you're willing to go through that learning curve, then, you know, you'll be great.
[00:16:27] But here's kind of where I want people to, what I want people to think about.
[00:16:31] So, I don't know if you can.
[00:16:34] Jeremy, I think, so Jeremy is our editor.
[00:16:38] He's our tech.
[00:16:39] He's listening right now.
[00:16:40] But we can, I wonder if we could put my first ever video like right here.
[00:16:44] Right.
[00:16:45] We can send it to you.
[00:16:47] And guess what?
[00:16:49] Torrible.
[00:16:50] It's really bad.
[00:16:52] Lighting's bad.
[00:16:53] Sound is bad.
[00:16:54] I don't know who my audience is, which is what I want to talk about next.
[00:16:58] But it's shit.
[00:16:59] But 2017, we're here in 2024.
[00:17:04] And you can actually very clearly see the evolution.
[00:17:07] Now I'm way more comfortable on camera.
[00:17:11] Mike's, you have like a perfect setup.
[00:17:14] And I'm actually an investor in a social media space where we're making money off of it.
[00:17:20] So from 2017 to 2024 with your favorite word, consistency, you know, this is kind of
[00:17:27] what happens.
[00:17:28] And here's the thing, DJ, that I want people to really understand is what are people hoping
[00:17:36] for when they start putting out social media content?
[00:17:40] Engagement.
[00:17:42] Which we'll lead to.
[00:17:43] Client.
[00:17:44] Which we'll lead to.
[00:17:45] Money.
[00:17:46] 
[00:17:46] 
[00:17:48] I started doing this in 2017.
[00:17:51] And that's what I was hoping for too.
[00:17:52] But there's so many ancillary benefits that people don't understand when they start
[00:17:58] doing this.
[00:17:59] And I think you probably understand this too.
[00:18:01] Oh, I didn't make a dollar for years.
[00:18:04] But I'm interested to hear from your podcast, you know, from the podcasting side.
[00:18:09] I'm going to give you some, I'm going to give you some runway here.
[00:18:12] But I didn't understand that this would be, you know, I'm a team lead.
[00:18:16] I didn't realize that this would be a lead generator for recruiting.
[00:18:21] Yeah.
[00:18:22] Absolutely.
[00:18:23] I didn't understand that this kicked off, you know, once a year, I go on speaking engagements.
[00:18:32] Yeah, me too.
[00:18:32] Yeah.
[00:18:33] And it's often around social media, et cetera.
[00:18:35] And you, so you don't know, right?
[00:18:37] I was actually just watching Tommy Choi's content.
[00:18:41] And all of a sudden he's a fucking food influencer.
[00:18:43] Because he saw that when he started talking about his favorite restaurants, that got the
[00:18:47] most engagement.
[00:18:48] And now he's, that's what he does.
[00:18:49] Yeah.
[00:18:50] And I bet you pretty soon he's going to make some money from some, you know, from something
[00:18:53] along those lines.
[00:18:55] So you don't, whoever's watching her listening, you don't know what's going to come of it.
[00:18:58] Right.
[00:18:58] You have no clue.
[00:19:02] So my point is that again, it doesn't matter if you want to do it, you have to do it.
[00:19:08] And there's a whole host of ancillary benefits that come with it.
[00:19:11] I'm curious, DJ, you know, you start this podcast.
[00:19:13] I'm assuming for recruiting purposes.
[00:19:16] The original thought, and I just got interviewed about this, was that this would be the way that
[00:19:21] I could recruit local agents here in Chicago, because I would feature top agents here in
[00:19:25] Chicago.
[00:19:26] Exclusively, it wouldn't be a nationwide podcast where we featured people outside of my area.
[00:19:31] And it would get me notoriety here.
[00:19:33] People would come in.
[00:19:34] Oh, I want to work at the firm that with the guy who's talking to these top agents.
[00:19:37] And yeah, that is, that is a, it's a nice thought.
[00:19:41] And ultimately, I think it does lead to that seven years later in a very sort of in the
[00:19:47] same way that you get those phone calls.
[00:19:49] Yeah.
[00:19:50] But I'll tell you what it has got me is maybe I don't get those calls.
[00:19:54] Like you don't get those calls.
[00:19:56] I just saw your video.
[00:19:57] I get people that come up to me when I am out in public and not just like walking down
[00:20:02] the street, but I'm in an event.
[00:20:03] So if I'm somewhere where other REALTORS are, people will come up to me and say, I listen
[00:20:07] to your show.
[00:20:08] You're super recognizable.
[00:20:09] Yes.
[00:20:10] You're probably the most recognizable non agent in the real estate community, which I
[00:20:17] didn't intend to do.
[00:20:19] I'm not comfortable doing that.
[00:20:21] I want to sit at a desk all day and not be out in public.
[00:20:24] And what's funny is when I do go out, I do get a lot of that attention.
[00:20:27] So what has been like some benefits?
[00:20:30] Okay, you start for recruiting.
[00:20:31] But what has it turned into unexpectedly?
[00:20:34] Well, it's turned into it pays for three staff members because I have sponsors who pay
[00:20:41] to be on the show who sell products and services to agents who want access to my audience.
[00:20:46] I read commercials for them.
[00:20:47] I'm sure I'm doing it on this this episode as well.
[00:20:50] 
[00:20:51] And pause.
[00:20:51] Yeah, insert commercial here.
[00:20:53] And that's been amazing.
[00:20:55] And I have these great relationships.
[00:20:56] I'll tell you what else it's done is because I've interviewed agents all over the country
[00:21:00] and the very top agents.
[00:21:02] In many cases, some of the top agents in the world would have come to their revenue.
[00:21:06] I have a lot of friends now who are these really big movers and shakers.
[00:21:11] And let's just say the world collapses.
[00:21:12] I lose my job.
[00:21:13] We got a business or something.
[00:21:15] I have a lot of people I can call and say, Hey, can you help me?
[00:21:18] And so there's that.
[00:21:20] I have also a lot of people have just wanted to learn about where I work because I recruit
[00:21:25] REALTORS.
[00:21:25] Here at Kale Realty because of the podcast.
[00:21:27] So yes, it does happen downstream.
[00:21:30] And it's also I get a lot of just people saying thank you.
[00:21:34] And so from a wanting to feel good about the contributions I make, that's also been
[00:21:40] super significant.
[00:21:41] So does it pay my mortgage?
[00:21:43] It does not.
[00:21:44] I don't intend for it to.
[00:21:45] It'd be nice.
[00:21:46] Maybe one day if it could, but it pays for three other people's mortgages.
[00:21:49] And that's really cool.
[00:21:51] And that that means a lot to me.
[00:21:52] And it means a lot to them.
[00:21:54] And it helps agents along the way.
[00:21:56] And it makes me a lot of friends.
[00:21:57] And it's really fun.
[00:21:58] So there's a lot of reasons to like it.
[00:22:01] And my boss lets me do it, which is really the best.
[00:22:04] You don't have a boss.
[00:22:05] Get out.
[00:22:06] Well, the person that, yeah, the person that signs my checks when I'm not signing the checks
[00:22:11] is, is, is, it's very grateful that we do it as well because it helps our brand.
[00:22:15] And you're right.
[00:22:16] I am not somebody that likes to create a lot of video on social media.
[00:22:19] And I need to get more comfortable with that.
[00:22:21] I mean, I do it for the show.
[00:22:22] But I like doing the audio side of it.
[00:22:25] And maybe I'm better at that as well.
[00:22:28] However, it is still something that I need.
[00:22:30] If I don't go outside my desk, I sit at my desk all day.
[00:22:34] So if I didn't do something on social media, whether it's this podcast or making short form video for agents,
[00:22:40] I'm not the guy that goes and smooths his at events.
[00:22:43] I don't enjoy doing that stuff.
[00:22:45] It's not for me.
[00:22:46] And I'm also connected.
[00:22:47] I'm also, yeah, I'm also not an agent.
[00:22:49] So I don't have as much in common funny that I speak to top agents.
[00:22:54] I don't really have a lot in common with top agents other than they've been on my show or they hear, they listen to my show.
[00:22:59] I have an idea.
[00:22:59] Okay, but you're actually perfect because you are a person that, you know, is resistant to going outside of your comfort zone for podcast.
[00:23:08] The video.
[00:23:08] Okay.
[00:23:09] So here's the exercise that we go through.
[00:23:11] So let's use DJ Paris, Delphin Paris as a case study.
[00:23:16] So the first thing that we want to figure out for you and for everyone listening is you need to figure out two things.
[00:23:22] What is your brand?
[00:23:24] Yep.
[00:23:24] So I'll tell you mine so that you can.
[00:23:26] Yeah.
[00:23:26] And who is your target?
[00:23:28] And you need to get extraordinarily specific.
[00:23:30] So for me, the brand that we have curated is called the approachable experts.
[00:23:37] That's everything that we do.
[00:23:39] And before we put out content, we want to make sure that that image is getting across.
[00:23:45] Okay.
[00:23:46] So let's pivot.
[00:23:47] Do you have a brand?
[00:23:48] I do.
[00:23:48] Oh, so what is it?
[00:23:49] So for the podcast, which is what we're on, my, so why I have two different, you know, sort of masters that I serve.
[00:23:57] One of my masters is the local master when it comes to recruiting.
[00:23:59] I have different efforts that I employ to recruit agents.
[00:24:03] This would not be the most direct path to doing that.
[00:24:06] So we're going to talk about 99% of our audience probably does not live in this area.
[00:24:11] So I'll talk about the 99% that's listening right now.
[00:24:13] These are agents.
[00:24:14] I would call them the coachable agents who look at top producers and who say, I want to do what they're doing.
[00:24:21] So that's your target.
[00:24:22] Correct.
[00:24:23] What's the DJ Paris brand?
[00:24:25] Oh, who am I?
[00:24:26] So what do I bring across?
[00:24:28] I think.
[00:24:28] Yeah, and name it is what I try to encourage people.
[00:24:31] Yeah, I would say I'm a likable, sort of empathic individual who likes bringing help and value to agents who are struggling.
[00:24:42] Yeah.
[00:24:42] So a word that comes to mind.
[00:24:43] It's like you want to come across as and you do already is trustworthy.
[00:24:47] Right.
[00:24:48] So trust worthy.
[00:24:49] Yeah, trust worthy, honest and like it's guide comes to mind.
[00:24:54] And you actually say it at the front of your show.
[00:24:56] I do.
[00:24:56] I'm your host and your guide.
[00:24:57] Yeah.
[00:24:58] That's my brand.
[00:24:59] The trustworthy guide.
[00:25:00] And you already touched on your, so you got that check brand.
[00:25:06] Now you're target.
[00:25:07] Right.
[00:25:08] And you just said it.
[00:25:09] Yeah, I'm, I estimate it's perhaps 5% of all the agents in America because those are the ones that take it seriously enough who look to these top agents, these avatars and go, how do they do that?
[00:25:20] But maybe they don't have access.
[00:25:21] Yep.
[00:25:21] So I give them access to, you know, or they're too busy to get access or they get rejected by the people that they're interested in talk to.
[00:25:28] I don't get rejected by those people.
[00:25:29] So I can get access to them.
[00:25:31] All I ask is you listen to my show, tell a friend, and that's how the whole machine keeps running.
[00:25:35] But yeah, that's kind of like a gate opener, like a door opener so that people can get, you know, a sneak peek in.
[00:25:41] I'll tell you my target.
[00:25:43] And yeah, super specific.
[00:25:45] Mine is a first time home buyers and sellers who are college educated and financially savvy.
[00:25:52] Right.
[00:25:52] So people that don't have to save who and who are looking to transition from renting to buy.
[00:25:58] The other piece is like when you, you know, I'm making some assumptions here, but when you're speaking to that person, that's, you know, they're going to resonate with it more.
[00:26:08] And that is usually the people with the kind of money that can, you know, afford in, you know, Bachtown, Lincoln Park, Lakeview.
[00:26:15] You know, that's, it is kind of is, it is what it is.
[00:26:18] I don't want to get into any, you know, dark water here.
[00:26:23] But what I would challenge people to do is once they have their brand and their target,
[00:26:28] is you don't put it out unless it's check, check.
[00:26:32] 
[00:26:33] It has to go through this.
[00:26:33] 100%.
[00:26:34] It has to go through a filter before it goes.
[00:26:36] That's how I do all my content as well.
[00:26:38] Yeah.
[00:26:38] So I kind of want to talk about what works as far as social media and it's your podcast guy in your video.
[00:26:47] Okay.
[00:26:48] Right.
[00:26:48] And I'm curious again, because you have two people again.
[00:26:54] I'm nowhere near your level up like in video that you are with podcast.
[00:26:58] But I guess if someone wanted to start a podcast and do it really, really well, what works?
[00:27:05] So what works is to your point is you have to get hyper specific about who are you serving?
[00:27:11] And what are their problems?
[00:27:13] How do you solve them?
[00:27:14] And how do you deliver that in a way that's better than what other people are already doing?
[00:27:19] So no different than video content creation.
[00:27:21] It's who's my audience?
[00:27:23] What do I, what are why, what's the messaging that they need to hear that they're going to be interested in hearing?
[00:27:27] How do I deliver that in a way that's accessible and that's better than what people already do?
[00:27:33] Because if you're doing what everyone else is doing sort of in its, you know, at its level of engagement,
[00:27:40] then you're really spinning your own wheels.
[00:27:42] And that's the challenge is can you be better than the existing, because there's competition.
[00:27:48] And you have to be better than your competition if you want to grow your, to grow your show or grow your, your bread.
[00:27:54] It's interesting.
[00:27:54] And what I think will be
[00:27:58] interesting for the audiences, you're talking from your place right now after how many years of experience?
[00:28:04] Seven.
[00:28:05] So it's funny.
[00:28:05] Mine is seven also from seven or eight.
[00:28:08] We can only talk from our frame of reference.
[00:28:11] And I'm going to go check you.
[00:28:12] I want you to do the same is
[00:28:15] I would argue that getting started and putting it out and
[00:28:21] exercising those muscles.
[00:28:23] It might be more important on the front end than making sure that you come with the most engaging idea.
[00:28:30] Yeah, so let's be clear.
[00:28:31] You will, you will not create anything worthwhile for a long time.
[00:28:36] But if you know what what you what it should be, if you know that it's, it's in other words,
[00:28:43] you have to have a level of taste where taste is is subjective.
[00:28:47] But you need to know that your taste is ultimately if I can get to that competency level in, in how I create content that I absolutely,
[00:28:56] if I can get there and it might take years, but if I can do that, if I can match what's in my head about how it should look and how it should sound, then, and I can
[00:29:05] willing to put in the time, then I will actually have success.
[00:29:08] Yes.
[00:29:08] And you have to be willing to fail for years, maybe not years.
[00:29:12] But, but certainly in my case years and that's just the way it is.
[00:29:16] It's like with anything you have to be willing to put out really bad stuff for a long time and not let that to suede you from continuing to put out stuff.
[00:29:25] That's the Mr. Beast method.
[00:29:26] He will tell you that he's number one YouTuber, right?
[00:29:29] He says your first 200 videos are going to be embarrassingly bad.
[00:29:33] I know it better than anyone.
[00:29:35] Yes, however, when you are in real estate and you're trying to, yeah, accomplish the end goal of
[00:29:42] turning a corner and becoming some former influencer.
[00:29:45] What I'm here to tell you is the worst case scenario is your friends and family.
[00:29:50] See it right, which is a huge, a huge win, a huge win.
[00:29:53] Okay.
[00:29:54] Now, if let's flip over to the the video side, what works when you're getting started?
[00:30:00] And I have the benefit of having done everything the wrong way five or six times.
[00:30:06] I don't even know if I'm doing it right.
[00:30:08] Me too.
[00:30:08] Yeah.
[00:30:09] Just, you know, try my best, right?
[00:30:11] If I could start over what I would do is try to marry two things that I love.
[00:30:18] One of them is real estate.
[00:30:20] So for you, it might, you know, it should be hopefully it's real estate.
[00:30:23] Sure.
[00:30:24] And something else.
[00:30:26] And I don't care if it is art, ballet, chess, passion, a passion of some kind,
[00:30:33] and really do your best to marry the two.
[00:30:37] I actually have this idea this week or last week.
[00:30:40] Where if I could start over.
[00:30:42] So one of my passions is basketball.
[00:30:44] I play three times a week.
[00:30:45] I'm a washed up old guy and I play in these games.
[00:30:48] 
[00:30:53] but what I wish I would have done and I think I might still do it is there are in Illinois
[00:30:58] some unbelievable houses with basketball courts in them.
[00:31:01] Sure.
[00:31:02] And I want to go and like, you know, actually don't have a kind of has one that's unbelievable
[00:31:07] and burr burr.
[00:31:08] I was looking at it today.
[00:31:09] And I go and I play horse against Dom McKenna at the basketball court.
[00:31:14] Be amazing.
[00:31:15] And you know, highlight the place and Mary, Mary two of my life's great love that.
[00:31:20] That's what I wish I would have done as opposed to, you know, if you're a buyer,
[00:31:26] you should do this.
[00:31:27] If you're a seller, you should do this, which worked and is great, but it gets stale very.
[00:31:32] I will tell you, I know people who get all of their leads or most of their leads
[00:31:37] from social media who never talk about real estate, who only talk about their interests.
[00:31:42] And or or even better will go even more in the middle.
[00:31:46] So it is tangentially real estate related.
[00:31:49] I know people who talk just about their local market, you do this, but literally talk
[00:31:54] non real estate stuff about their local market like where's the best dentist in my area?
[00:31:59] Where's the best hair styles?
[00:32:01] Who, who, where's the, where's the best pet store?
[00:32:04] You know, things that aren't necessarily real estate, but that people who live in that area.
[00:32:10] And again, they're not going to go viral.
[00:32:12] They're not going to get famous.
[00:32:13] They're not going to be an influencer.
[00:32:15] They're going to become micro famous.
[00:32:16] They're going to become famous at the local level, which is what you want as a REALTOR.
[00:32:20] And they're going to be important to the community that they serve and the businesses that they serve.
[00:32:25] And they don't even think about real estate.
[00:32:27] They just say, how do I create content that people who want to live here care about?
[00:32:31] Yep.
[00:32:33] And you have the benefit, we have the benefit of hindsight now.
[00:32:36] Sure. I wish I would have thought of that.
[00:32:37] Sure.
[00:32:38] Yeah. I wish I wish I had DJ telling me that that's what I should do when I was 25 here.
[00:32:42] I am 38.
[00:32:43] Right.
[00:32:46] And honestly, I think that, you know, it's enough.
[00:32:50] Right.
[00:32:51] I think we've delivered enough to tell people you have, you have to do it.
[00:32:54] Yep.
[00:32:56] Brand target some simple ways to get started.
[00:32:59] Some simple ideas that hopefully, you know, juices get flowing.
[00:33:02] And I think I just want to drive the point home is this is going to be a long term play.
[00:33:07] Right. Seven years for you.
[00:33:08] Seven of years for me.
[00:33:10] If you can find a way to enjoy it and start there.
[00:33:14] Right.
[00:33:15] So you don't, you know, instead of saying, I don't want to do this, you know, ten out of ten times.
[00:33:19] You're only saying, I don't want to do this.
[00:33:21] Two out of ten times, then you're going to have that long jeopardy because you care.
[00:33:26] You want to.
[00:33:26] And it's your posting content with things that you're interested in, like you said, passion,
[00:33:31] whether it's basketball, cooking, Tommy choice case, I just started after 30 years of playing guitar
[00:33:38] in a more traditional sense for rock and roll style music with classical or with acoustic or electric.
[00:33:45] I said, I want to go and learn classical guitar.
[00:33:47] I specifically to ultimately be able to play flamenco guitar, which is a style of Spanish guitar.
[00:33:52] But in order to do that, you really have to have a strong classical foundation.
[00:33:55] Better business with Ben next time.
[00:33:57] So you're bringing your guitar.
[00:33:58] So I'm happy to.
[00:34:00] So I don't, I'm not happy to always show people the imperfections of my playing, which is absolutely.
[00:34:06] I've been playing for 30 years and this is like learning an instrument, a entirely new instrument.
[00:34:10] It's so,
[00:34:13] it's so frustrating that, but I know that's good for me.
[00:34:16] So talking about getting outside your comfort zone, nobody wants to make videos.
[00:34:20] Nobody's comfortable behind the camera.
[00:34:21] So for you, those of you listening, you don't have to be, it doesn't matter.
[00:34:25] And you don't have to worry about the quality being so good.
[00:34:27] You just have to put it out something that you think has one little modicum of interest
[00:34:32] to somebody out there that you want to attract to your sphere or who's related to somebody.
[00:34:38] Like you said, who's who's who's yeah, who's a Ruth.
[00:34:41] So for me, maybe putting again, for me to create more video content for my social media channels,
[00:34:48] for either my recruiting or for this podcast or for both, maybe it does make sense for me to put me practicing
[00:34:55] some of my classical guitar, not to show off because that's the last thing I would ever want to do is say,
[00:35:00] look at how cool I am and people who play guitar tend to want to do that.
[00:35:03] So that's not me.
[00:35:04] So I have to figure out a way that's authentic.
[00:35:06] It doesn't come across as, you know, me trying to say, look at how cool this is because it isn't really, especially it's classical guitar.
[00:35:12] It's really not cool.
[00:35:13] But, but it shows that I have its interest.
[00:35:16] I'm willing to fail.
[00:35:17] I'm willing to be sort of bad at something, but also persevere through it.
[00:35:21] And I think that inspires people, whatever the interest is like you with basketball to say that even though, you know,
[00:35:27] you're technically a middle aged person.
[00:35:29] Right.
[00:35:30] 
[00:35:31] Well, I am too.
[00:35:32] And I didn't start working out till six years ago.
[00:35:35] You know, it's it.
[00:35:35] Yeah, seven years ago.
[00:35:36] But anyway,
[00:35:38] but I get inspired by people who are doing things.
[00:35:41] And especially that they're doing things outside of their immediate like industry.
[00:35:46] So I think that's great.
[00:35:47] I think I should put out this content.
[00:35:49] It's not related to helping agents become better at real estate.
[00:35:52] Sure it is.
[00:35:53] Well, it is in the sense that it's talking about what this conversation, but it's also how do I get better?
[00:35:59] And you don't have to be consistent.
[00:36:01] You don't have to watch podcast.
[00:36:02] You don't have to go get a coach.
[00:36:03] No, of course you do.
[00:36:04] It's the same thing.
[00:36:05] 
[00:36:06] Yeah.
[00:36:08] We can talk about this forever.
[00:36:10] DJ, can I can I do the outro?
[00:36:12] Let's do it.
[00:36:13] But let's get people to task.
[00:36:14] So let's go back to this.
[00:36:16] So everybody who's listening, who yes, you might already be doing content.
[00:36:20] Are you doing content around a passion that's outside of specifically a real estate related,
[00:36:27] trying to, you know, answer a question or educate people about real estate.
[00:36:30] So maybe we should create a a to do for people.
[00:36:35] So let's let's think about what we already so we already had one to do.
[00:36:38] Yes, people and if they post a story or a real
[00:36:42] tag us in it.
[00:36:43] If they and they tag both DJ or top producer top agent interviews.
[00:36:50] Top agents search for keeping it real.
[00:36:52] You'll find it.
[00:36:53] Yeah, it were and or the reality.
[00:36:56] We will share it as a story.
[00:36:58] Yeah, free views, free followers.
[00:37:01] I'll even make a video for you.
[00:37:03] How about that?
[00:37:03] So that's one to do.
[00:37:05] And I think the second to do and if we're talking about
[00:37:09] a video or podcast, I guess right?
[00:37:13] You have the podcast king is okay.
[00:37:15] What would first step be for podcasts if someone has been thinking about podcasts?
[00:37:19] Okay, come up with a topic.
[00:37:20] Come up with a 10 minutes of something that you want to talk about.
[00:37:26] That is something that you think is of interest to someone else.
[00:37:31] And around a very, very hyper specific passion.
[00:37:36] That's all you got to do.
[00:37:37] I don't care if it's you know you you enjoy researching
[00:37:42] collectibles on eBay.
[00:37:44] Even if it's that and it's like, oh, I look at stamps or coins or
[00:37:49] it doesn't even have to be something in the cool category because there's
[00:37:52] someone else out there who is waiting for somebody to make a podcast or a
[00:37:56] video about that particular passion.
[00:37:58] And I'm going to say similar something for video is and if you want to
[00:38:04] email me cool, it's benfmalliseam.com
[00:38:06] and I'll critique it right.
[00:38:08] So real estate has to be one I think absolutely for
[00:38:13] marry it with another passion and come up with an idea.
[00:38:15] And as DJ was talking to me or just talking now,
[00:38:21] let's say you're really into stamps or chess or whatever the case may be.
[00:38:25] If you want to marry it with real estate, you know, you you very,
[00:38:30] very easily could like the best stamp collections that
[00:38:34] clients have the coolest chess sets, you know, that are in listings.
[00:38:40] The best, you know, if you're a cook, the most interesting kitchen X that
[00:38:45] I've seen in listing, et cetera, basketball.
[00:38:47] We kind of already gave it athletes homes or whatever the case may be.
[00:38:53] Send it to me and we'll workshop it together.
[00:38:55] Love that.
[00:38:56] Yeah, and let's not make it a podcast.
[00:38:58] So for the interview aspiring podcasters, there are so many steps
[00:39:02] involved with putting a podcast together, distributing it.
[00:39:05] It's it's just a lot even even if you're you're really wanting to put the
[00:39:09] time and if you want that, you can contact me.
[00:39:11] I'll help you through that or I'll give you some time.
[00:39:13] But what's really easy is to take your phone and turn it around and shoot a
[00:39:18] 30 second 60 second video about one thing that either showcases your interest
[00:39:23] or something about you in real estate and just do that because that is easy.
[00:39:28] There's no big editing there.
[00:39:30] There's no big lift.
[00:39:31] We can all do that.
[00:39:32] The podcast thing is a lot.
[00:39:34] So if you want to do that, my hat's off to you, but or just come to a
[00:39:38] content club and we'll handle all of your podcast everything for you.
[00:39:41] Well, the here's the biggest problem with podcasting is that you have to
[00:39:44] figure out how to distribute it and you have to figure out how to get the
[00:39:47] message across that you even have this thing.
[00:39:49] And that means you have to do it on social, which means you might as well
[00:39:52] do social media video because that's a lot easier and there's so many.
[00:39:56] There's billions.
[00:39:57] That's why I was like you have to do a video podcast.
[00:39:59] That's why we're here right now.
[00:40:00] We are doing a video.
[00:40:01] Yeah.
[00:40:02] So and I didn't for so many years because I thought, oh, no, I'm an audio
[00:40:06] guy and it's like, oh, well, you know, obviously a lot more people are
[00:40:09] watching videos and listening.
[00:40:10] You've got a you've got a voice for radio and a face for the movies.
[00:40:15] Podcasts will ultimately go the way of physical books.
[00:40:18] I absolutely believe that as much as I hate to say that, they will absolutely
[00:40:23] go the way of physical books.
[00:40:25] They will they will discipline audio audio only podcast.
[00:40:29] Will eventually be like, remember when we used to listen to podcasts?
[00:40:32] I know we think no people are going to need them on their
[00:40:35] commutes to their to their to their jobs.
[00:40:38] No, they won't.
[00:40:38] They will be watching things autonomous vehicles will totally change that.
[00:40:43] I'm telling you don't start a podcast now.
[00:40:45] Really, I wouldn't.
[00:40:46] I would absolutely if I could do if I could yes, start a video podcast.
[00:40:51] That is that is that is it's not even the future is absolutely what you
[00:40:55] should be doing today.
[00:40:55] We have enough podcasts.
[00:40:56] Yeah.
[00:40:57] And also I don't want the competition.
[00:40:59] Yeah.
[00:41:01] Take us out DJ.
[00:41:02] No, you said you would you would do that.
[00:41:04] What's that? Oh, I was I was just messing around.
[00:41:07] Okay, well, I'll do it that any very much for here.
[00:41:10] Let me try.

Now, as a real estate recruiter, I can tell you the answer is always yes. But most agents aren't looking to move right now. So how do you know who to contact? Well, what if I were to tell you there's a recruiting and retention tool powered by artificial intelligence that shows you exactly which agents in your local market are looking to leave their brokerage right now? And which agents at your own firm are also looking to leave you. Now, I've been recruiting REALTORS for 15 years and I've hired over 2000 agents. I can tell you with no exaggeration, this is the tool I've been waiting for. Corded's AI looks for trends across dozens of variables for each agent in your market and shows you which agents they believe are likely to move. Not only does it do that, but corded's AI went and visited my recruiting website and read everything I offer. So now when I'm recruiting, corded's AI tells me exactly what to say based on that agent's needs and what my brokerage can offer. It even writes emails for me. I've never seen anything like it and I use it every single day. Now, if you are looking to grow your brokerage, corded.io is the best tool out there. Visit corded.io to schedule a demo again. That's corded.io. And now, onto the show. Welcome to Keeping It Real, the largest podcast made by real estate agents and for real estate agents. My name is DJ Paris. I'm your guide and host through the show today is our monthly series called Better Business with Ben with Ben Lala's. Ben Lala's is with Compass and he runs the Ben Lala's team. He's one of the top teams here in the Chicago land area does several hundred million dollars in sales every year. He and his team and he comes on every month very generously to talk about what he's doing to motivate his team to keep his team growing and also just advice in general to our audience. He's a big a long time listener and we are super honored to have him. Ben Lala's calm is where you go. Ben Lala's team is where you find him on Instagram. We will have links to that in the show notes. And I do encourage you to follow him on Instagram and Facebook be in LinkedIn because we're going to be talking about social media today. And I think you're going to be actually talking about what you do and it's nice that people can actually then absorb your content. So Ben Lala's team is where you find him. You can go to his website. All of his social is linked there as well. But Ben, welcome to Better Better Business with Ben. Yeah, I like a long, long time listener first time. It's not my first time. This is my 10th time probably on the show now. Yeah. Yeah, I love it. I'm excited to talk about social. And by no means like an influencer, no matter how hard I try. But I have a lot to share. Kind of like obviously the trajectory, my growth trajectory can be linked to social media. We should also set the stage that you as a team leader, which is not always the case. You actually do a lot of the content. You actually star in the content. You write the content. You have a team that is helping produce it. But you are actually creating a lot of content for your team. Yes, that's exactly right. Because I believe in it. And I believe it's the way that people want to be reached because it all starts with the audience. But let's backtrack for a second, DJ. Let me ask you a question. Before we get started, what is the best CRM? It's the one you're using. Yeah, it's the one you use. So as we talk to people about social media, any strategy is going to be better than no strategy. Anything that you are actually going to do and use is going to work better than just throwing something at the wall. Now we should also mention too that there are many different channels and ways to distribute social media content and really different strategies for each one of those channels. If you really wanted to do it effectively, so maybe you're also saying maybe don't choose all the social media channels to focus on. Maybe pick one or two. I'd probably even one. Where is my ideal audience hanging out is probably the question there. Yeah. And we're talking about social media. This is really, really broad. So the way I've looked at it is you kind of have like various stages. Let's call you DJ are very much an expert in social media. Thank you. You have a podcast. I don't know if you knew that on video, one of the largest real estate podcast platforms in the world, the country. And then you have amateur, someone who's never put out a video in their entire life, but I kind of want to link something very quickly. So let's go back in time. 2017. I was doing four million in sales. I had never put out a single video. Right. But in 2018, I put out 50 videos. And my sales went from four to 14. Then in 2019, I put out like 120-ish videos. And sales went from 14 to 23. And you saw direct correlation between the video content and the growth. So here's the problem with social media and kind of all marketing. You should probably know this. Sure. Now, it's impossible to draw a direct line from videos to actual sales. Unless you're getting that call, I just saw your video, which you probably rarely get that call. So I know exactly how many times I've gotten that call. Do you want to know how many? How many? I guess a dozen. Twelve. Yeah. So 12 times since 2017, it's, you know, 2025 right now. Hundreds of videos in your wake. Yeah. So maybe thousands. Four thousand videos to date now, right? So we cut them all. So you're not going to get the calls, what you say. So I've gotten that call and say, Hey, Ben, I just saw XYZ video. And I want you to be my real estate agent from I call that a stranger. Yeah. But you know what happens way more often is I'll give you an example. Okay. So one of my best friends, his name is David. Okay. David went to college. His college roommate was his name is Brad. So the way these algorithms work is they think if David likes Ben's content, let's serve some up to Brad. Pretty logical. Sure. Right? So Brad reaches out to David and asks, Hey, is your friend Ben legit? David being the good friend that he is says, yeah, Ben's the man, right? Or some variation of that. So now Brad has the confidence to reach out to me and introduce me to his mom, Ruth. Now is Ruth Brad's mom? Is she a stranger? Certainly. Right? But that's pretty close. It's my best friend's college roommate's mom. And we should mention that Ruth is not watching her content. No, I don't. I mean, Ruth has. Possibly, but she's likely. Well, I've talked about Ruth many times before. And neither Brad nor Ruth has ever reached out. Gotcha. And let me tell you what Ruth represents. So I helped Ruth sell her home in the suburbs by one in the city. And then she's referred me to friends both who whom have sold. And then they moved out of the moved out of the state. OK. So she's responsible for somewhere in the neighborhood of, I think it's like two, two and a half million dollars of total sales. It's like $40,000. Amazing. So I like to tell people that there's this, I call it a coin to term, the fallacy of the stranger, where everyone thinks that they're going after some random person that they have absolutely no connection to. And that's who they're trying to drive into their content. And I'm jealous of those people. You and I both know people that have made that happen. Yeah. And that path is usually done most, most often on YouTube. And that's a long play and it is a grind. It's a lot of work. And honestly, DJ, I'm trying my hardest. But listen, I know that I'm not Ryan Sirhant. Right. Right. I am a normal real estate agent in the city. But I also know that social media has become mandatory, not optional. And here's your first biggest tip. Can I curse on this? Sure. I can't. So every single time, this time included, I don't want to do this. I video has gotten so mundane for me. But you know what I tell myself? I write before this, I go, Ben, like, excuse me. Fuck your mood, Ben. It doesn't matter. You have to do this. The same way that you don't want to call call, you don't always have to be. I don't want to do push ups in the gym. Yeah, you don't always have to be in the mood to do social. But if you want to compete with the DJ parishes in the Ben Lallys of the world, you're going to have to. I'm sorry. I don't know what to tell you. That's a case. Yeah. So the question is, and I think for everyone, you know, depending on who you are, and I am going to go through if you're a beginner, intermediate, and expert, and what you can and should be doing. So you know, if you take a look at my content, if you're watching this right now, I am assuming some people are like, that's a lot. Podcasts set up, background, mics. We have one. Can we look at this camera together? One, two, three cameras. Three camera shoot. Yeah, this has got to be super intimidating. Yeah. Right? But if you are just getting started, you've never shot a video. Can we invite people to do it right now? Sure. Let's put some money on the line. Okay. If anyone listening gets out their phone and shoots something saying, hey, this is my first video. I want to thank Ben Lallys and DJ Paris for giving me the confidence to do this. If you're watching, I would love to be your real estate agent. Something in that vein will return the shot on. Absolutely. Deal. So someone who has like a new platform, I have X, thousand followers. You have thousands of followers. We'll repost it and we'll be that catalyst for you. Great. Is that a deal? Happy to do it. Yeah. So if you are an amateur, it doesn't require much. If you want to just get started, your phone is good enough. The problem is sometimes the audio isn't so good. Right. So if you're going to invest on Amazon, how much is one of a mic? A laugh mic? Yeah. Less than a hundred bucks. I think you could probably get one. Jeremy, how much is a cheap mic? It's probably about 50 bucks. Yeah. And then all of a sudden you have really great sound. Now you're probably doing that for a long time and everyone has asked me like, when do you step up? Right. When did you? When did you? You didn't always have like some crazy setup. When did you have to 25 bucks as Jeremy? When did you level up and know that you needed to take your real estate game to the next hour? Yeah. So with my podcast, I had a $50 mic and a $100 board. And today I have a $400 mic and a $100 board. And staff. And yes. So staff is the big thing. Yeah. So when? When did you have to level up? It was at least two years. Two years in. Yeah. Yeah. So what I tell people and I did all the production. I did everything myself by yourself. And this was not my job. So it's pretty easy is when you don't have enough time is when you start upgrading, whether that's in software and people, et cetera. And that can usually be tied to sale. You'll know when it's that time. Yeah. So if you're out doing showings and you're making money and social media is a priority, that's when you start hiring people. Now, who do you hire first? How much money is it going to cost? Et cetera, is usually the next question. And God bless the day and age that we're in is there's a lot of digital creators out there. And there's a lot of digital platforms. AI is certainly something that needs to be talked about. But you could probably, and if you don't have someone reach out to us, you could probably get a videographer for a half day for how much? Oh, gosh. I don't know. I never get videographers. I think you could probably get a videographer for a half day for $250 to $400 here in Chicago. Pretty reasonable. And from there, depending on how hands on you want to be, right? So they're, again, the videographer will probably offer editing services so you can chop that up into X number of reals or short form content or edit it into long form. But in this day and age, depending, again, on how much work you want to do, you can find editors overseas or software that can chop up that long form into short form for you. Four hours of content, if you've already thought it out, plan it out. Can you yield 30 pieces of content, something like that? And congratulations, you have, I don't know, between eight and it could be the whole eight weeks and 50 weeks of content, depending on how much you want to spread. And what do you think we're paying for that editing? Editing can be very, very affordable, depending on the route you go. Yeah. The whole world can bid on this too. Yeah. And we've talked about this in previous episodes. You're familiar with Upwork. Sure. I use it all the time. Yeah. So we use Upwork religiously. And sometimes you get what you pay for, you have to do some research. It takes some time, right? And this is, it comes back to, if you want, can I pull, I'm going to plug it. If you want to jump all of the learning, you just come to a place like contentclubshakago.com, come to content club and they handle it for you, right? So you just sit down, they edit it, lighting sound, etc. But if you want to save some money and do it yourself, you can handle all of that stuff. Pretty reasonably, and your best friend, chat GPT, can probably coach you through exactly what those steps are. Yeah. And how to find the right people. Yeah. And, yeah. How many times have you failed on Upwork though? It's happened. Yeah. But more often than not, I get people that are really, I know, I know what to look for. Now you know it. Now you know it. There's a bit of a learning curve. Yeah. So if you're willing to go through that learning curve, then, you know, you'll be great. But here's kind of where I want people to, what I want people to think about. So, I don't know if you can. Jeremy, I think, so Jeremy is our editor. He's our tech. He's listening right now. But we can, I wonder if we could put my first ever video like right here. Right. We can send it to you. And guess what? Torrible. It's really bad. Lighting's bad. Sound is bad. I don't know who my audience is, which is what I want to talk about next. But it's shit. But 2017, we're here in 2024. And you can actually very clearly see the evolution. Now I'm way more comfortable on camera. Mike's, you have like a perfect setup. And I'm actually an investor in a social media space where we're making money off of it. So from 2017 to 2024 with your favorite word, consistency, you know, this is kind of what happens. And here's the thing, DJ, that I want people to really understand is what are people hoping for when they start putting out social media content? Engagement. Which we'll lead to. Client. Which we'll lead to. Money. I started doing this in 2017. And that's what I was hoping for too. But there's so many ancillary benefits that people don't understand when they start doing this. And I think you probably understand this too. Oh, I didn't make a dollar for years. But I'm interested to hear from your podcast, you know, from the podcasting side. I'm going to give you some, I'm going to give you some runway here. But I didn't understand that this would be, you know, I'm a team lead. I didn't realize that this would be a lead generator for recruiting. Yeah. Absolutely. I didn't understand that this kicked off, you know, once a year, I go on speaking engagements. Yeah, me too. Yeah. And it's often around social media, et cetera. And you, so you don't know, right? I was actually just watching Tommy Choi's content. And all of a sudden he's a fucking food influencer. Because he saw that when he started talking about his favorite restaurants, that got the most engagement. And now he's, that's what he does. Yeah. And I bet you pretty soon he's going to make some money from some, you know, from something along those lines. So you don't, whoever's watching her listening, you don't know what's going to come of it. Right. You have no clue. So my point is that again, it doesn't matter if you want to do it, you have to do it. And there's a whole host of ancillary benefits that come with it. I'm curious, DJ, you know, you start this podcast. I'm assuming for recruiting purposes. The original thought, and I just got interviewed about this, was that this would be the way that I could recruit local agents here in Chicago, because I would feature top agents here in Chicago. Exclusively, it wouldn't be a nationwide podcast where we featured people outside of my area. And it would get me notoriety here. People would come in. Oh, I want to work at the firm that with the guy who's talking to these top agents. And yeah, that is, that is a, it's a nice thought. And ultimately, I think it does lead to that seven years later in a very sort of in the same way that you get those phone calls. Yeah. But I'll tell you what it has got me is maybe I don't get those calls. Like you don't get those calls. I just saw your video. I get people that come up to me when I am out in public and not just like walking down the street, but I'm in an event. So if I'm somewhere where other REALTORS are, people will come up to me and say, I listen to your show. You're super recognizable. Yes. You're probably the most recognizable non agent in the real estate community, which I didn't intend to do. I'm not comfortable doing that. I want to sit at a desk all day and not be out in public. And what's funny is when I do go out, I do get a lot of that attention. So what has been like some benefits? Okay, you start for recruiting. But what has it turned into unexpectedly? Well, it's turned into it pays for three staff members because I have sponsors who pay to be on the show who sell products and services to agents who want access to my audience. I read commercials for them. I'm sure I'm doing it on this this episode as well. And pause. Yeah, insert commercial here. And that's been amazing. And I have these great relationships. I'll tell you what else it's done is because I've interviewed agents all over the country and the very top agents. In many cases, some of the top agents in the world would have come to their revenue. I have a lot of friends now who are these really big movers and shakers. And let's just say the world collapses. I lose my job. We got a business or something. I have a lot of people I can call and say, Hey, can you help me? And so there's that. I have also a lot of people have just wanted to learn about where I work because I recruit REALTORS. Here at Kale Realty because of the podcast. So yes, it does happen downstream. And it's also I get a lot of just people saying thank you. And so from a wanting to feel good about the contributions I make, that's also been super significant. So does it pay my mortgage? It does not. I don't intend for it to. It'd be nice. Maybe one day if it could, but it pays for three other people's mortgages. And that's really cool. And that that means a lot to me. And it means a lot to them. And it helps agents along the way. And it makes me a lot of friends. And it's really fun. So there's a lot of reasons to like it. And my boss lets me do it, which is really the best. You don't have a boss. Get out. Well, the person that, yeah, the person that signs my checks when I'm not signing the checks is, is, is, it's very grateful that we do it as well because it helps our brand. And you're right. I am not somebody that likes to create a lot of video on social media. And I need to get more comfortable with that. I mean, I do it for the show. But I like doing the audio side of it. And maybe I'm better at that as well. However, it is still something that I need. If I don't go outside my desk, I sit at my desk all day. So if I didn't do something on social media, whether it's this podcast or making short form video for agents, I'm not the guy that goes and smooths his at events. I don't enjoy doing that stuff. It's not for me. And I'm also connected. I'm also, yeah, I'm also not an agent. So I don't have as much in common funny that I speak to top agents. I don't really have a lot in common with top agents other than they've been on my show or they hear, they listen to my show. I have an idea. Okay, but you're actually perfect because you are a person that, you know, is resistant to going outside of your comfort zone for podcast. The video. Okay. So here's the exercise that we go through. So let's use DJ Paris, Delphin Paris as a case study. So the first thing that we want to figure out for you and for everyone listening is you need to figure out two things. What is your brand? Yep. So I'll tell you mine so that you can. Yeah. And who is your target? And you need to get extraordinarily specific. So for me, the brand that we have curated is called the approachable experts. That's everything that we do. And before we put out content, we want to make sure that that image is getting across. Okay. So let's pivot. Do you have a brand? I do. Oh, so what is it? So for the podcast, which is what we're on, my, so why I have two different, you know, sort of masters that I serve. One of my masters is the local master when it comes to recruiting. I have different efforts that I employ to recruit agents. This would not be the most direct path to doing that. So we're going to talk about 99% of our audience probably does not live in this area. So I'll talk about the 99% that's listening right now. These are agents. I would call them the coachable agents who look at top producers and who say, I want to do what they're doing. So that's your target. Correct. What's the DJ Paris brand? Oh, who am I? So what do I bring across? I think. Yeah, and name it is what I try to encourage people. Yeah, I would say I'm a likable, sort of empathic individual who likes bringing help and value to agents who are struggling. Yeah. So a word that comes to mind. It's like you want to come across as and you do already is trustworthy. Right. So trust worthy. Yeah, trust worthy, honest and like it's guide comes to mind. And you actually say it at the front of your show. I do. I'm your host and your guide. Yeah. That's my brand. The trustworthy guide. And you already touched on your, so you got that check brand. Now you're target. Right. And you just said it. Yeah, I'm, I estimate it's perhaps 5% of all the agents in America because those are the ones that take it seriously enough who look to these top agents, these avatars and go, how do they do that? But maybe they don't have access. Yep. So I give them access to, you know, or they're too busy to get access or they get rejected by the people that they're interested in talk to. I don't get rejected by those people. So I can get access to them. All I ask is you listen to my show, tell a friend, and that's how the whole machine keeps running. But yeah, that's kind of like a gate opener, like a door opener so that people can get, you know, a sneak peek in. I'll tell you my target. And yeah, super specific. Mine is a first time home buyers and sellers who are college educated and financially savvy. Right. So people that don't have to save who and who are looking to transition from renting to buy. The other piece is like when you, you know, I'm making some assumptions here, but when you're speaking to that person, that's, you know, they're going to resonate with it more. And that is usually the people with the kind of money that can, you know, afford in, you know, Bachtown, Lincoln Park, Lakeview. You know, that's, it is kind of is, it is what it is. I don't want to get into any, you know, dark water here. But what I would challenge people to do is once they have their brand and their target, is you don't put it out unless it's check, check. It has to go through this. 100%. It has to go through a filter before it goes. That's how I do all my content as well. Yeah. So I kind of want to talk about what works as far as social media and it's your podcast guy in your video. Okay. Right. And I'm curious again, because you have two people again. I'm nowhere near your level up like in video that you are with podcast. But I guess if someone wanted to start a podcast and do it really, really well, what works? So what works is to your point is you have to get hyper specific about who are you serving? And what are their problems? How do you solve them? And how do you deliver that in a way that's better than what other people are already doing? So no different than video content creation. It's who's my audience? What do I, what are why, what's the messaging that they need to hear that they're going to be interested in hearing? How do I deliver that in a way that's accessible and that's better than what people already do? Because if you're doing what everyone else is doing sort of in its, you know, at its level of engagement, then you're really spinning your own wheels. And that's the challenge is can you be better than the existing, because there's competition. And you have to be better than your competition if you want to grow your, to grow your show or grow your, your bread. It's interesting. And what I think will be interesting for the audiences, you're talking from your place right now after how many years of experience? Seven. So it's funny. Mine is seven also from seven or eight. We can only talk from our frame of reference. And I'm going to go check you. I want you to do the same is I would argue that getting started and putting it out and exercising those muscles. It might be more important on the front end than making sure that you come with the most engaging idea. Yeah, so let's be clear. You will, you will not create anything worthwhile for a long time. But if you know what what you what it should be, if you know that it's, it's in other words, you have to have a level of taste where taste is is subjective. But you need to know that your taste is ultimately if I can get to that competency level in, in how I create content that I absolutely, if I can get there and it might take years, but if I can do that, if I can match what's in my head about how it should look and how it should sound, then, and I can willing to put in the time, then I will actually have success. Yes. And you have to be willing to fail for years, maybe not years. But, but certainly in my case years and that's just the way it is. It's like with anything you have to be willing to put out really bad stuff for a long time and not let that to suede you from continuing to put out stuff. That's the Mr. Beast method. He will tell you that he's number one YouTuber, right? He says your first 200 videos are going to be embarrassingly bad. I know it better than anyone. Yes, however, when you are in real estate and you're trying to, yeah, accomplish the end goal of turning a corner and becoming some former influencer. What I'm here to tell you is the worst case scenario is your friends and family. See it right, which is a huge, a huge win, a huge win. Okay. Now, if let's flip over to the the video side, what works when you're getting started? And I have the benefit of having done everything the wrong way five or six times. I don't even know if I'm doing it right. Me too. Yeah. Just, you know, try my best, right? If I could start over what I would do is try to marry two things that I love. One of them is real estate. So for you, it might, you know, it should be hopefully it's real estate. Sure. And something else. And I don't care if it is art, ballet, chess, passion, a passion of some kind, and really do your best to marry the two. I actually have this idea this week or last week. Where if I could start over. So one of my passions is basketball. I play three times a week. I'm a washed up old guy and I play in these games. but what I wish I would have done and I think I might still do it is there are in Illinois some unbelievable houses with basketball courts in them. Sure. And I want to go and like, you know, actually don't have a kind of has one that's unbelievable and burr burr. I was looking at it today. And I go and I play horse against Dom McKenna at the basketball court. Be amazing. And you know, highlight the place and Mary, Mary two of my life's great love that. That's what I wish I would have done as opposed to, you know, if you're a buyer, you should do this. If you're a seller, you should do this, which worked and is great, but it gets stale very. I will tell you, I know people who get all of their leads or most of their leads from social media who never talk about real estate, who only talk about their interests. And or or even better will go even more in the middle. So it is tangentially real estate related. I know people who talk just about their local market, you do this, but literally talk non real estate stuff about their local market like where's the best dentist in my area? Where's the best hair styles? Who, who, where's the, where's the best pet store? You know, things that aren't necessarily real estate, but that people who live in that area. And again, they're not going to go viral. They're not going to get famous. They're not going to be an influencer. They're going to become micro famous. They're going to become famous at the local level, which is what you want as a REALTOR. And they're going to be important to the community that they serve and the businesses that they serve. And they don't even think about real estate. They just say, how do I create content that people who want to live here care about? Yep. And you have the benefit, we have the benefit of hindsight now. Sure. I wish I would have thought of that. Sure. Yeah. I wish I wish I had DJ telling me that that's what I should do when I was 25 here. I am 38. Right. And honestly, I think that, you know, it's enough. Right. I think we've delivered enough to tell people you have, you have to do it. Yep. Brand target some simple ways to get started. Some simple ideas that hopefully, you know, juices get flowing. And I think I just want to drive the point home is this is going to be a long term play. Right. Seven years for you. Seven of years for me. If you can find a way to enjoy it and start there. Right. So you don't, you know, instead of saying, I don't want to do this, you know, ten out of ten times. You're only saying, I don't want to do this. Two out of ten times, then you're going to have that long jeopardy because you care. You want to. And it's your posting content with things that you're interested in, like you said, passion, whether it's basketball, cooking, Tommy choice case, I just started after 30 years of playing guitar in a more traditional sense for rock and roll style music with classical or with acoustic or electric. I said, I want to go and learn classical guitar. I specifically to ultimately be able to play flamenco guitar, which is a style of Spanish guitar. But in order to do that, you really have to have a strong classical foundation. Better business with Ben next time. So you're bringing your guitar. So I'm happy to. So I don't, I'm not happy to always show people the imperfections of my playing, which is absolutely. I've been playing for 30 years and this is like learning an instrument, a entirely new instrument. It's so, it's so frustrating that, but I know that's good for me. So talking about getting outside your comfort zone, nobody wants to make videos. Nobody's comfortable behind the camera. So for you, those of you listening, you don't have to be, it doesn't matter. And you don't have to worry about the quality being so good. You just have to put it out something that you think has one little modicum of interest to somebody out there that you want to attract to your sphere or who's related to somebody. Like you said, who's who's who's yeah, who's a Ruth. So for me, maybe putting again, for me to create more video content for my social media channels, for either my recruiting or for this podcast or for both, maybe it does make sense for me to put me practicing some of my classical guitar, not to show off because that's the last thing I would ever want to do is say, look at how cool I am and people who play guitar tend to want to do that. So that's not me. So I have to figure out a way that's authentic. It doesn't come across as, you know, me trying to say, look at how cool this is because it isn't really, especially it's classical guitar. It's really not cool. But, but it shows that I have its interest. I'm willing to fail. I'm willing to be sort of bad at something, but also persevere through it. And I think that inspires people, whatever the interest is like you with basketball to say that even though, you know, you're technically a middle aged person. Right. Well, I am too. And I didn't start working out till six years ago. You know, it's it. Yeah, seven years ago. But anyway, but I get inspired by people who are doing things. And especially that they're doing things outside of their immediate like industry. So I think that's great. I think I should put out this content. It's not related to helping agents become better at real estate. Sure it is. Well, it is in the sense that it's talking about what this conversation, but it's also how do I get better? And you don't have to be consistent. You don't have to watch podcast. You don't have to go get a coach. No, of course you do. It's the same thing. Yeah. We can talk about this forever. DJ, can I can I do the outro? Let's do it. But let's get people to task. So let's go back to this. So everybody who's listening, who yes, you might already be doing content. Are you doing content around a passion that's outside of specifically a real estate related, trying to, you know, answer a question or educate people about real estate. So maybe we should create a a to do for people. So let's let's think about what we already so we already had one to do. Yes, people and if they post a story or a real tag us in it. If they and they tag both DJ or top producer top agent interviews. Top agents search for keeping it real. You'll find it. Yeah, it were and or the reality. We will share it as a story. Yeah, free views, free followers. I'll even make a video for you. How about that? So that's one to do. And I think the second to do and if we're talking about a video or podcast, I guess right? You have the podcast king is okay. What would first step be for podcasts if someone has been thinking about podcasts? Okay, come up with a topic. Come up with a 10 minutes of something that you want to talk about. That is something that you think is of interest to someone else. And around a very, very hyper specific passion. That's all you got to do. I don't care if it's you know you you enjoy researching collectibles on eBay. Even if it's that and it's like, oh, I look at stamps or coins or it doesn't even have to be something in the cool category because there's someone else out there who is waiting for somebody to make a podcast or a video about that particular passion. And I'm going to say similar something for video is and if you want to email me cool, it's benfmalliseam.com and I'll critique it right. So real estate has to be one I think absolutely for marry it with another passion and come up with an idea. And as DJ was talking to me or just talking now, let's say you're really into stamps or chess or whatever the case may be. If you want to marry it with real estate, you know, you you very, very easily could like the best stamp collections that clients have the coolest chess sets, you know, that are in listings. The best, you know, if you're a cook, the most interesting kitchen X that I've seen in listing, et cetera, basketball. We kind of already gave it athletes homes or whatever the case may be. Send it to me and we'll workshop it together. Love that. Yeah, and let's not make it a podcast. So for the interview aspiring podcasters, there are so many steps involved with putting a podcast together, distributing it. It's it's just a lot even even if you're you're really wanting to put the time and if you want that, you can contact me. I'll help you through that or I'll give you some time. But what's really easy is to take your phone and turn it around and shoot a 30 second 60 second video about one thing that either showcases your interest or something about you in real estate and just do that because that is easy. There's no big editing there. There's no big lift. We can all do that. The podcast thing is a lot. So if you want to do that, my hat's off to you, but or just come to a content club and we'll handle all of your podcast everything for you. Well, the here's the biggest problem with podcasting is that you have to figure out how to distribute it and you have to figure out how to get the message across that you even have this thing. And that means you have to do it on social, which means you might as well do social media video because that's a lot easier and there's so many. There's billions. That's why I was like you have to do a video podcast. That's why we're here right now. We are doing a video. Yeah. So and I didn't for so many years because I thought, oh, no, I'm an audio guy and it's like, oh, well, you know, obviously a lot more people are watching videos and listening. You've got a you've got a voice for radio and a face for the movies. Podcasts will ultimately go the way of physical books. I absolutely believe that as much as I hate to say that, they will absolutely go the way of physical books. They will they will discipline audio audio only podcast. Will eventually be like, remember when we used to listen to podcasts? I know we think no people are going to need them on their commutes to their to their to their jobs. No, they won't. They will be watching things autonomous vehicles will totally change that. I'm telling you don't start a podcast now. Really, I wouldn't. I would absolutely if I could do if I could yes, start a video podcast. That is that is that is it's not even the future is absolutely what you should be doing today. We have enough podcasts. Yeah. And also I don't want the competition. Yeah. Take us out DJ. No, you said you would you would do that. What's that? Oh, I was I was just messing around. Okay, well, I'll do it that any very much for here. Let me try. Thank you very much for joining DJ Paris and Ben Lales. The keeping it real podcast. The only real estate podcast for real estate agents. Buy real estate agent. Sure. That's good. I'm a real estate. Close enough. This was better business. This was a better business with Ben. I am Ben Lales and don't forget to you know, if you enjoy this podcast, make sure that you engage with our sponsors without them. We're not able to do what we do. Thank you to content club here in Chicago for donating the space giving us the space on this time. This is not lost on me. This is a very big deal. So super thank you to contact club. If you are a local Chicago agent and you do not have a production studio and I know you don't, I don't have one either. You need to reach out to these guys. They can just do it all for you and it's not that expensive. It's absolutely worth it. Don't try to do everything yourself. I wish I could have told myself that seven years ago. If you're a real estate agent and you're looking for a brokerage home, reach out to DJ. He's always looking for a great agent. True. Who need to hang their license in a great environment. If you're looking to join a team, contact Belman. That's the guy. Did I hit everything? I think we did. Except we just want to say thank you to our audience and we want to also thank our audience on behalf of them for for you Ben for you spending time. You are doing this in a very generous and gracious way. This is not lost on me either. I am so grateful for all of our people that come on our show. But you in particular because you're on every month. You donate this time, the space and it is really my honor to be able to hear what you want to say because you are the you are actually my audience is I want people like you listening and I also want people like you on the show. So thank you so much on behalf of Ben and myself. We want to thank this 5% of the real estate agent world that is tuning in right here to this podcast. And again, you were in a very special group. I want to say this. I don't say this enough. You are taking the time to try to improve your skill. Like it's not about my ego.
