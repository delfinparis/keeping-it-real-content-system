[00:03:16] All right, guys, enough about all of that.
[00:03:18] Let's get to the main event, my conversation with Ryan Rodenbeck.
[00:03:35] Today on the show, our guest is Ryan Rodenbeck from Spyglass Realty and also the host of Realty
[00:03:43] Hack Podcast.
[00:03:44] So let me tell you more about Ryan.
[00:03:46] Now, Ryan grew up in Louisiana and moved to Austin in 2001.
[00:03:51] He started Spyglass Realty in 2008, which would gosh, that had to have been a tough year
[00:03:57] to start a realty, but he did.
[00:03:59] And it was really created as a place to be as a solo agent with maybe a couple other agents.
[00:04:06] He was building this company.
[00:04:08] In 2015, he started to put pyrons in place to take his team into a real brokerage and
[00:04:13] he built systems and processes in place to grow the team.
[00:04:17] Now in 2019, he sold his last home by 2021.
[00:04:20] He had grown the brokerage from just a couple of agents to 42 agents.
[00:04:26] And in 2024, now he's up to almost 150 agents, which is insane.
[00:04:32] I'm a recruiter.
[00:04:33] I know how difficult that is to do.
[00:04:34] And he's doing it.
[00:04:36] And I'm glad he's not in my market because he'd be stealing our agents away.
[00:04:39] But he doesn't hire new agents.
[00:04:41] He doesn't hire part-time agents.
[00:04:42] And I'll tell you why, because his leadership team's main focus is hiring agents that have
[00:04:47] the potential to double or triple their production.
[00:04:51] Ryan has served in an advisory role for many real estate platforms, as well as other tech
[00:04:55] companies.
[00:04:56] He served on the customer advisory board for Workplace by Facebook and Genie.ai.
[00:05:03] Now he keeps up with current technology trends and is always looking for ways to contribute
[00:05:07] to automation and technology services.
[00:05:09] And I would like everybody to follow Ryan's podcast or visit Ryan's podcast, subscribe
[00:05:15] to it realtheac.com or whatever podcast app you're looking, look, just search for real
[00:05:21] T-Hack hit that subscribe button, but realtheac.com.
[00:05:24] You can listen to all of his episodes on that website.
[00:05:26] And also, if you are a REALTOR in the Austin area and you would like a firm that is interested
[00:05:32] in doubling and tripling your production, Spyglass Realty is the place to check out.
[00:05:38] SpyglassRealty.com is where you go to learn about all things Spyglass and see if you'd
[00:05:42] be a good option and fit for their team and if they'd be a good fit for you.
[00:05:46] And yeah, so SpyglassRealty.com, RealtyHack, we will have links to all of this in the
[00:05:52] show notes.
[00:05:52] Ryan, welcome to the show.
[00:05:54] Wow, that was an introduction, man.
[00:05:56] I think I need you to go out with me here in Austin and then do that same speech.
[00:06:02] Well, I'll tell you.
[00:06:03] Yeah, I'd be happy to.
[00:06:05] I mean, there's, there's worse cities to come down and hang out.
[00:06:09] But thank you so much for being on the show.
[00:06:12] It's just a quick little funny thing.
[00:06:13] Well, not funny to Ryan, but funny to us.
[00:06:16] Poor Ryan, we were supposed to schedule, we were supposed to do the thing last week and
[00:06:22] I got a message about it.
[00:06:24] I didn't know it wasn't on my calendar.
[00:06:25] And so all of a sudden, Zana goes, person's been waiting for 20 minutes.
[00:06:29] Are you not showing up?
[00:06:30] And I'm like, what are you talking about?
[00:06:31] And so Ryan has been gracious enough.
[00:06:34] This really speaks to his character and just what a nice guy he is.
[00:06:37] Normally, Zana was like, I don't think he's going to want to reschedule because we
[00:06:41] just let him hang in for 20 minutes and he goes, hey, it happens.
[00:06:43] No problem.
[00:06:45] So we're grateful to have him today.
[00:06:46] So really, it was very, very grateful to Ryan for being so kind about that.
[00:06:51] And also, again, if you are a broker or a REALTOR in the Austin area,
[00:06:56] Ryan's a real good guy.
[00:06:57] So you should reach out to him if you're not getting what you need from your firm.
[00:07:01] But Ryan, I'd love to learn a little bit more about how you got started in real estate.
[00:07:06] I know you moved to Austin, 2001, but what brought you into real estate?
[00:07:10] You know, I owned a company that was filing claims for class action lawsuits, particularly
[00:07:16] on a siding manufacturer that had a warranty.
[00:07:21] And, you know, anyway, we would knock on doors or send out mailers, let people know that
[00:07:27] they had, there is a class actually lawsuit.
[00:07:30] They, in most cases, they were unaware of that.
[00:07:33] Then we moved from there to like trying to get more, you know, bulk business.
[00:07:37] So we, we, we hit up property managers.
[00:07:40] I was already investing in real estate at the time.
[00:07:43] And when that, the class action limitations ended in 2005, we were looking for something
[00:07:53] to get into.
[00:07:54] And real estate was because we were already working with property managers and companies,
[00:07:58] because I was an investor, you know, started in doing investment property.
[00:08:02] Sure.
[00:08:03] Yeah.
[00:08:03] Yeah, that makes sense.
[00:08:05] And, and so you started doing working with investors.
[00:08:09] And then how did you just, because you know, working with investors is, is, is a whole
[00:08:14] different animal, of course.
[00:08:16] There's lots of agents that do it, lots of agents that don't know how to do it.
[00:08:19] Yeah.
[00:08:19] Or wish they could learn how to do it.
[00:08:21] And, and, but you didn't, you didn't stop there.
[00:08:24] You basically created a team and then you decided, you know, this brokerage thing sounds
[00:08:28] pretty good.
[00:08:29] And you know, I would love to learn a little bit about how you transitioned from, you know,
[00:08:34] working with investors individually to eventually building this team and then saying, hey, I want
[00:08:39] to, I want to just run the brokerage.
[00:08:41] Yeah.
[00:08:41] So, you know, our original name of our company was Spiglass Realty and Investments.
[00:08:46] And the idea was to have a focus on investment properties.
[00:08:50] Sure.
[00:08:50] I wanted, I didn't want to be the Hokey REALTOR, you know, with their quotes there.
[00:08:56] And what I realized is investors are good to have, but it can be tough when the market's
[00:09:04] down.
[00:09:04] And so, you know, we, we did focus on investment property for a long time.
[00:09:09] We still do investment property.
[00:09:11] But I wanted to become a top producing real estate agent.
[00:09:15] So, about 2011ish, I went full force into some co-chains, you know, joined a coaching
[00:09:25] mastermind that was very intense.
[00:09:28] I said, you know, where can I get all of the habits that I want from a top producing
[00:09:33] agents and implement that into my own solid selling.
[00:09:38] It became a top producing listing agent.
[00:09:40] I was in a platinum top 50, nine years in a row and the ABJ, top 50, like three times.
[00:09:47] But yeah.
[00:09:48] And so, it was really having that mentality of, you know, I don't want to be the lazy
[00:09:53] REALTOR that just puts a sign in the yard.
[00:09:57] But let's be, let's look at every variable you can to help sell the home, got completely
[00:10:02] early into listings.
[00:10:05] And then, you know, employed these other services like, you know, I think I was a tiger
[00:10:10] leads customer back in the day and, you know, brought in a 2.7 million dollar list of
[00:10:16] buyer.
[00:10:17] Now, yeah, that was, I think, of my record completely.
[00:10:21] And that was an internet lead.
[00:10:23] Can you believe it?
[00:10:24] Yeah.
[00:10:25] And now that the number doesn't seem so high, but back in 2014, it was, right?
[00:10:31] And so, you know, I said to myself, I've got a handful of agents.
[00:10:38] I'm bringing in internet leads.
[00:10:40] What if I could do to building a team, what I did to manifesting being a top producing
[00:10:48] listing agent?
[00:10:49] And so, that's where I, you know, again, did the same thing that I did before.
[00:10:54] I've been going to conferences for 15 years, started meeting with the friends, you know,
[00:10:59] that I met conferences.
[00:11:00] You know, you can always get more information of people that aren't in your market.
[00:11:04] And, you know, they're just aligning with tech companies as well.
[00:11:08] Like I'm still like, I'm good friends with the owners of White Lopo and Ballet Boss and,
[00:11:11] you know, just really diving into these communities.
[00:11:15] Yeah, I love that.
[00:11:17] And you seem very coachable, I guess, would be maybe, would you say that's a secret of
[00:11:23] your success is being able to say, oh, you, you know, in your mastermind group, for example,
[00:11:28] it was a lot like, how do you guys do it?
[00:11:29] Oh, you do it that way.
[00:11:30] I'll try that.
[00:11:30] Absolutely.
[00:11:31] I mean, I think, you know, arrogance can be a roadblock to success, especially when you're
[00:11:37] trying to learn new things.
[00:11:38] Yeah, let's tell us before we get deeper into spyglass, we want to talk about your podcast
[00:11:44] because I obviously are listeners, are podcast listeners and we want to give them, you
[00:11:50] know, other podcast ideas.
[00:11:51] So tell us about Realty Hack.
[00:11:53] Yeah.
[00:11:53] So I started that about four years ago and, you know, I've, I've, because I've been,
[00:11:59] you know, networking and traveling to different real estate conferences over 15 years.
[00:12:04] I, I knew I had a list of people that I wanted to interview that are associates or friends
[00:12:09] of mine.
[00:12:09] And so I started Realty Hack podcast four years ago.
[00:12:14] I went through all the CEOs of like the prop tech companies by the both follow boss,
[00:12:19] REW, you know, what's interesting though is the shift when I started going like, my
[00:12:25] audience is mostly local.
[00:12:27] It's getting a little bit national right now, but still overwhelmingly local.
[00:12:33] And the, you know, I was really interested in the prop tech and the journey, that kind
[00:12:38] of how I built this of real estate technology.
[00:12:42] And what I found very interesting is that when I would interview someone local, a local
[00:12:49] prop producer agent, and it would just, I get three, four times the amount of engagement
[00:12:54] that then, you know, what I found is that the agent's interest is not always aligned with
[00:13:01] mine.
[00:13:02] 
[00:13:02] And so, you know, and I'll be very honest with, with you is it, it is a, it's a recruitment
[00:13:08] tool.
[00:13:09] Of course.
[00:13:09] Yeah.
[00:13:10] Just being able to, you know, elevate your brand and putting all your stuff on Instagram
[00:13:14] with, you know, with terms of, in terms of, of making sure that when we have a podcast,
[00:13:22] we email it out.
[00:13:23] And then it's been probably one of the biggest facilitators of recruitment that I've ever
[00:13:30] done in my life.
[00:13:31] That's amazing.
[00:13:32] I, I need to do a better job of that myself because of course, this could be a better,
[00:13:38] a bigger recruiting tool for, for me as well.
[00:13:41] And when I first started the show, I wanted it to be sort of, I wanted it to, to be agnostic,
[00:13:50] right?
[00:13:50] Broker, or brokerage agnostic because I was asking these top producers who most of them
[00:13:56] work from our firm to sort of share their secrets.
[00:13:58] And I thought, well, they're probably not going to want me sharing their secrets and then
[00:14:02] promoting my business or my broker, or our brokerage.
[00:14:05] So I, I, and then I never kind of revisited it.
[00:14:07] And I think I'm to the point now where I think everyone's okay with me saying, oh, by the
[00:14:12] way, this is what I do.
[00:14:13] And so I have to start, I have to make that transition myself.
[00:14:16] But I will tell you from doing it for, I think this is our sixth or seventh year, that just
[00:14:21] by sheer force of being a podcast directed to other broke, or other agents that, you know,
[00:14:27] word has, has spread pretty rapidly in our local market as well.
[00:14:31] So our, our biggest concentration of listeners are also from our local market.
[00:14:34] Yeah.
[00:14:35] And, and here's the other thing, how it's evolved over the, over the years.
[00:14:38] In January of 23, we started our first Realty Hack summit, which we had 250 people, you
[00:14:45] know, agents, our agents outside agents.
[00:14:49] In 24, we had our second one, we had over 400 people.
[00:14:53] It was a total hit.
[00:14:54] We've had, you know, we have a headliner.
[00:14:56] We've had Jimmy Macon and, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh,
[00:15:00] Britney Hodeck from Super fans.
[00:15:02] Um, you know, they were two of our keynotes last year at Anthony Machia and Howard Tager.
[00:15:06] So it's, it's really, and then, and then the next evolution, which is about to happen
[00:15:11] and now is we're about to release Realty Hack Academy, which is a Kajabi subscription
[00:15:16] base.
[00:15:17] Sure.
[00:15:17] You know, we're not even out yet, but it, we're, we're close.
[00:15:20] We're working on it for a year and a half.
[00:15:21] And to particularly because when we, and this came about is because we are the biggest
[00:15:26] solo flex team in Austin, the, the highest converting one.
[00:15:31] And so we, we were already doing all these lessons in Kajabi for our team.
[00:15:36] And so that's what you, when you go back, you might as well offer it to everyone.
[00:15:39] Yeah.
[00:15:39] Absolutely.
[00:15:40] And by, right away for everyone listening who doesn't undo, he said flex and you may
[00:15:45] now know what that is.
[00:15:46] Not every market has this.
[00:15:47] So Zillow has an option, what they call their flex program.
[00:15:51] They have premier agent and flex premier agent as you pay up front for the leads and whatever
[00:15:55] happens happens, flexes, you pay on the back end.
[00:15:58] And they are very selective about who they send those flex leads to here in our local
[00:16:03] market.
[00:16:04] There's only four teams out of 46,000 REALTORS that they send those leads to.
[00:16:10] So the reason I'm saying that is if you are a REALTOR in the Austin area, I guarantee there's
[00:16:15] only a few people that are getting these flex leads and Ryan and his team have them.
[00:16:20] So this is another reason to reach out to see if they may be a good fit.
[00:16:23] Yeah, I appreciate that.
[00:16:25] And we're, we're working with Zillow right now.
[00:16:27] It's one of those things that like, you know, he used to be, I used to be a Zillow
[00:16:31] hater.
[00:16:32] Okay.
[00:16:33] And I became a victim, joined him.
[00:16:34] But, you know, what I've learned is over the years is, you know, you cannot fight change.
[00:16:42] You need to embrace it.
[00:16:42] You can try, but it's not going to work.
[00:16:44] You can try.
[00:16:44] That's right.
[00:16:45] And with every any potential crisis or commission compression or whatever it is, you really
[00:16:52] need to figure out your angle.
[00:16:55] And we've come to have an excellent partnership with Zillow.
[00:16:59] Yeah.
[00:16:59] Yeah.
[00:17:00] Yeah.
[00:17:00] Zillow has been a good partner to our show as well.
[00:17:03] And I know not everybody feels positively about them.
[00:17:06] However, I will tell you everyone I've ever met in the Zillow organization has really been
[00:17:12] a nice, good human being.
[00:17:14] So I'm, I've not seen any of the monsters trying to ruin our industry, but I know people
[00:17:20] have their own opinions and that's okay.
[00:17:22] But what's nice to know is that they do have, you know, different types of lead options
[00:17:26] where if you're thinking, oh my gosh, I can't afford to pay $10,000 a month.
[00:17:30] Well, you may, you may be able to join a team that has access to these flex leads.
[00:17:35] It's very hard to get flex leads.
[00:17:38] And I'm like, we, like none of our agents would, would qualify for those here.
[00:17:42] We have 800 agents here at our firm.
[00:17:44] So I am very, very impressed that you are one of the Zillow's flex partners.
[00:17:49] And look, who doesn't need more leads everywhere.
[00:17:51] Yeah.
[00:17:51] So love it.
[00:17:53] So, you know, tell us now I am mostly impressed, Ryan, with your recruiting strategy, because,
[00:18:00] you know, everybody wants full-time agents, everybody wants, you know,
[00:18:05] high producing, listing agents, of course.
[00:18:08] But not everyone is able to say I want agents that want to double and triple their
[00:18:13] production because I know how to do that.
[00:18:15] Of course, brokerages might say that, but you, you actually walk that talk.
[00:18:19] So can I just ask you, what is the, and again, I know it's a lot of different
[00:18:24] things when somebody comes to you and says, I want to double and triple my production,
[00:18:27] that they need to do to end up with that result.
[00:18:31] But what, where do you usually start with somebody, when somebody comes to you and says,
[00:18:34] hey, I'm a full-time agent, I'm doing, let's say, 15 deals a year,
[00:18:39] I'm pretty modest production.
[00:18:40] I'd like to get to 30 deals a year.
[00:18:42] Where do you sort of start with that person?
[00:18:44] Well, we look at what their lead sources are.
[00:18:47] And, you know, there's two types of agents that we recruit.
[00:18:50] One, our agent's been a business, one to three years and have done one to three million likes.
[00:18:55] 
[00:18:55] We, whatever we're so good with that, okay?
[00:18:59] Because we plug them into our lead sources and we plug them into our automation,
[00:19:03] like our sending out our monthly newsletter, putting people in the seller's
[00:19:08] suites and home bots and things like that, right?
[00:19:11] We also do a quarterly gift-giving thing where someone,
[00:19:16] agent can just come on our site and plug in how many bunch cakes they want to be delivered, right?
[00:19:23] And so that's probably the simplest way.
[00:19:26] Like getting an agent is between one to three million to six million or more.
[00:19:31] That's easy for us, but you have the lead sources.
[00:19:34] Now, the ones agents that are more veteran agents that are doing 12 to 15 deals a year,
[00:19:39] that is tougher because what I always tell agents is you don't want to take my
[00:19:45] leads when you have a pipeline that's full.
[00:19:48] Doesn't make financial sense, okay?
[00:19:50] So how we evaluate the agent's business, we figure out where their lead sources are,
[00:19:55] what's that one lever they're pulling and how can we help facilitate that so they can do
[00:20:01] more work in less time?
[00:20:03] So is that through email campaigns?
[00:20:05] If it's, let's say it's farming, right?
[00:20:08] We automate the farming process for them.
[00:20:11] Sure.
[00:20:12] And just whatever lever they're going to pull is what we double down on.
[00:20:17] And we've done it so many times that we know all the levers, I think,
[00:20:22] but the experience of working with other agents that way.
[00:20:25] But you know what you're saying right now is so logical and rational and seemingly,
[00:20:32] you know, sort of like common sense.
[00:20:35] Like we're going to, we're going to, you know, approach when I meet an agent who's
[00:20:39] interested in joining from like a consultant's perspective, where's your pain points?
[00:20:42] You know, where are you struggling?
[00:20:44] You can't do everything perfectly.
[00:20:45] Where are you falling a bit behind?
[00:20:47] And then Ryan and his team are like, okay, well, if we can do that for you, we will.
[00:20:53] And I love that approach.
[00:20:54] And I'm not sure.
[00:20:56] And I hate to say this because it sort of makes, makes a sound like the industry is,
[00:21:01] not doing a lot of this, but I don't know that the industry is doing a lot of this.
[00:21:04] Like as I'm thinking about it, I mean, I ask people when they join us,
[00:21:08] hey, where are your pain points?
[00:21:10] And then, you know, try to figure out if we can solve them.
[00:21:12] But I don't know that every brokerage does.
[00:21:15] I know brokerages will think, well, if one of your pain points is one of the things
[00:21:18] we just have, then great.
[00:21:20] But I like the idea of you guys really saying, we'll take that off your plate for you.
[00:21:24] That's not what most brokerages do.
[00:21:26] They might say we have resources to do it or, you know, maybe there's an admin
[00:21:30] that can help with X, Y, or Z.
[00:21:31] But I love the fact that you guys are tailor making basically a custom plan for
[00:21:36] somebody to take something that they aren't good at right off their plate.
[00:21:40] Yeah.
[00:21:40] And what we've done is really looked at our mission statement and core values.
[00:21:44] Our mission statement is we make good agents into great agents.
[00:21:46] Okay.
[00:21:47] Our core values, which we live and die by these are do the right thing,
[00:21:52] be smart, be all in and take action.
[00:21:54] So if an agent embodies those four core values,
[00:21:58] there really should be no reason that they can't succeed here.
[00:22:02] If they're now they're not being smart, they're not taking action or they're not
[00:22:06] all in, then any one of those things can cause failure, especially the taking action part.
[00:22:15] Yeah, absolutely.
[00:22:17] So when, so I like that idea.
[00:22:19] So if again, speaking to spyglass, which is Ryan's brokerage,
[00:22:24] if you're in the Austin area and you're managing broker or whoever the manager
[00:22:28] is for you is not saying, Hey, where are you struggling?
[00:22:31] Not not just, Hey, do you need, you know, obviously everybody wants more leads?
[00:22:36] That's a pretty pretty simple one.
[00:22:37] But if the manager, if the manager isn't coming over saying, Hey,
[00:22:41] where are you struggling right now?
[00:22:42] Let me see if I can take that off your plate, which most managing brokers are not going
[00:22:46] to do that.
[00:22:48] Then you should reach out to Ryan and see if, if, you know, you could, if you
[00:22:51] are can live those four values that he just described.
[00:22:55] He wants you because if you can do those four things, he can do the rest.
[00:23:00] So, so that's, that's pretty impressive.
[00:23:02] I'm, Ryan, I know you're, you're a big tech guy and I'd love to sort of get your
[00:23:07] thoughts on where you think the tech space is headed for REALTORS.
[00:23:11] I know there's a lot of concern about whether always has been concerned about tech
[00:23:16] sort of replacing agents.
[00:23:17] I don't, we don't have to have that conversation because so far it hasn't happened.
[00:23:21] But it's always a bit of a threat.
[00:23:22] But I'm curious on where you see technology developing to assist agents.
[00:23:26] Do you have any, any thoughts about, you know, where you're seeing some of your,
[00:23:29] your friends in the tech space working on new tools?
[00:23:32] Absolutely.
[00:23:33] I mean, I think we are seeing more efficiency from a measurement standpoint,
[00:23:38] you know, like we're, we're using a company called Maverick, which is an
[00:23:42] offshoot of wild elbow where we can see how many agents are, you know,
[00:23:48] making the first time appointments, keeping their appointments.
[00:23:50] And if they're not keeping appointments, why are they not, or if the people,
[00:23:54] if they're writing offers and they didn't go through, why are, why are they not
[00:23:58] writing more offers like that type of thing?
[00:23:59] So that's one of the things, right?
[00:24:02] The other thing that we're, we're talking about with them in particular,
[00:24:05] especially with our Realty Hack Academy is I'm talking with them about having
[00:24:09] at the end of a segment where an agent has gone through our videos and our
[00:24:16] questionnaires and they know how we want them to speak.
[00:24:20] Okay.
[00:24:21] Then they're doing live calls with an AI bought and the AI bought is,
[00:24:27] is it like the consumer?
[00:24:29] Oh, yeah, that's really slick.
[00:24:32] Wow.
[00:24:33] Yeah.
[00:24:34] That is, I love that.
[00:24:35] So you basically practice role playing.
[00:24:38] Absolutely.
[00:24:38] Yeah.
[00:24:39] With AI with AI and the other thing that I think we're going to see is AI in
[00:24:45] terms of like in your CRM, right, predictive analysts, looking at,
[00:24:52] you know, automations between when a property, you know,
[00:24:58] what a contract comes in, you know, sending out, you know,
[00:25:02] a AI being able to look at the different scenarios and then say,
[00:25:04] should you want to send this email or this email, right?
[00:25:07] I mean, this is progressing really, really fast.
[00:25:10] And I think that like you said, we're, there's a robot's never going to show
[00:25:14] a house, right?
[00:25:15] But it can make us more productive.
[00:25:18] And that's what we're trying to lean into and see who can give us the best
[00:25:22] efficiency, what tech teams are out there and how can we employ that with our
[00:25:26] brokerage?
[00:25:27] I love that.
[00:25:27] I'll tell you where I see a huge opportunity in the CRM space.
[00:25:31] And I know that we partner with real geeks here at our firm,
[00:25:35] follow up boss we've worked with in the past two.
[00:25:37] They were a big supporter of our show.
[00:25:40] And I know real geeks is working on this.
[00:25:42] And I'm sure they're all working on it.
[00:25:43] All the CRM providers, but this idea of prompt.
[00:25:48] So right now when we think about AI, it's mostly a question and answer sort of scenario.
[00:25:53] We ask a question.
[00:25:53] We get an answer very similar to like what the Greeks, we used to say the Oracle
[00:25:57] at Delphi like the all-knowing thing, you ask it a question, it gives you an answer.
[00:26:00] And that's great.
[00:26:01] I think the next iteration or certainly a different use case will be when the
[00:26:06] AI goes in just on its own starts looking at the data in the CRM, for example,
[00:26:10] all the contacts.
[00:26:12] And then starting to figure out reasons to reach out to each one of those contacts
[00:26:16] at different times.
[00:26:17] Obviously, the most obvious example would be like, obviously birthdays.
[00:26:20] Well, that already kind of, that's not really an AI thing.
[00:26:22] That's just a pretty simple algorithmic thing that most CRMs have.
[00:26:25] But what would be really cool is if, for example, it started looking deeper.
[00:26:30] And it started, you know, maybe tying together somebody's social media
[00:26:33] profiles, which some of them do that now.
[00:26:35] And starting to reason, hey, we know this, we just noticed this person went to
[00:26:38] Cabo on a vacation.
[00:26:40] Maybe a good time to reach out and say, how is the trip to Cabo?
[00:26:42] Right?
[00:26:43] Maybe more interpersonal things, but instead of the agent having to look to figure
[00:26:48] these things out, that stuff's going to be coming to us and say, hey, make
[00:26:51] these 10 calls today.
[00:26:52] That's genius.
[00:26:53] Yeah.
[00:26:53] I haven't even thought about like that.
[00:26:55] But like, all right, someone had a baby, someone's kid graduated from high school.
[00:27:00] These are all, you know, a life event that can trigger a sale, right?
[00:27:06] Yeah.
[00:27:06] Yeah.
[00:27:07] So I'm hopeful that that's kind of where it's headed, where there's going to be
[00:27:10] more about the system telling you what to do versus you going through and
[00:27:15] really trying to figure out who to contact.
[00:27:17] So I'm excited to see that piece of it.
[00:27:21] Now, let's talk about the NAR settlement, not the settlement itself,
[00:27:25] but just sort of the changes that you're seeing.
[00:27:28] You know, the big concern, of course, is right now with buyer representation.
[00:27:33] Now agents are going to have to explain how commissions worked, which I
[00:27:39] argue they should have done from the beginning, but whatever not everyone did.
[00:27:42] And I understand why, right?
[00:27:43] I get that it wasn't a conversation that was, I think it's absolutely
[00:27:47] essential, but a lot of agents didn't because they could say, well, it's
[00:27:50] really just coming out of the seller side, which isn't really the case, but
[00:27:53] whatever, it's sort of true, but not really.
[00:27:55] And here we are in this mess.
[00:27:57] So how are you training your agents to now have those buyer agency
[00:28:03] conversations to say, this is what I charge.
[00:28:06] Here's how it normally works.
[00:28:08] And here's how it might work differently.
[00:28:10] If, for example, we see a 0% co-op, well, I mean, you wouldn't explain it
[00:28:14] that way to the client, but, you know, if an agency is a 0% co-op,
[00:28:18] they're going to be very concerned.
[00:28:20] And we are starting to see those.
[00:28:22] I don't know if in your market, if you've seen any of those yet, but obviously
[00:28:25] that speaks to this buyer agency agreement situation.
[00:28:28] So how are you training agents to deal with things like that?
[00:28:31] So we're training them exactly as we have before.
[00:28:35] 
[00:28:36] We're not seeing very much pushback on it.
[00:28:39] And I think that, you know, pre-subtlement and post-subtlement,
[00:28:44] the consumer is going to, you know, the average consumer buying home is
[00:28:51] going to know around the same amount.
[00:28:54] Right.
[00:28:54] And we were, we're, I mean, as before and after.
[00:28:57] Okay.
[00:28:58] The difference is now there's a possibility that it may have to come out of their pocket.
[00:29:04] Well, you know, I think when we talk to agents, we talked to agents to tell them to work with buyers,
[00:29:09] just explain, you know, I charge whatever X amount commission.
[00:29:14] Okay.
[00:29:15] And a lot of times most sellers will pay for a commission allotment.
[00:29:21] If it's not X amount, then it will come out of your pocket or we can roll it into closing
[00:29:27] cost.
[00:29:28] Okay.
[00:29:29] But I think as an industry, we have been very, very lax on how to explain a buyer contract.
[00:29:37] 100%
[00:29:38] And I don't know any other industry that's been so scared of explaining a contract.
[00:29:43] I would say the only one that comes to mind is certain insurance products where
[00:29:49] like fees and commissions are kind of hidden.
[00:29:51] Other than that, it is not that common.
[00:29:54] Well, right.
[00:29:55] And in the insurance, you know, those, that's complicated.
[00:29:58] What we're doing is really not that complicated.
[00:30:01] Now, especially Fannie Mae says that that's not going to be, you know, commissions not going to be part of the allowable closing costs,
[00:30:08] which I called that a year ago.
[00:30:10] I knew that was going to happen.
[00:30:11] So, you know, I think when you talk to consumers and you're explaining this, if they have the question,
[00:30:18] well, what happens if, you know, they're not paying any commission?
[00:30:23] Well, then, you know, you'll have to pay, you know, and look, we have the ability to go down.
[00:30:30] Okay.
[00:30:30] We can't go up.
[00:30:31] Let me say I'm going to go down to reduce our commission.
[00:30:34] So I think any good agent is going to look at every scenario and say, what's best for my client?
[00:30:40] But what's what a best for my client?
[00:30:42] And how can I still get paid?
[00:30:44] The reality is is that I believe commissions are going to go down 10, maybe 20%.
[00:30:51] Okay.
[00:30:52] It's okay because in this town, I believe we're going to see 10% value increase.
[00:31:02] So whatever we lose, we're going to make it up in a couple of years.
[00:31:06] We just have to be diligent about how we explain our services, add value to the clients and give them different options.
[00:31:14] I mean, the reality is that if a seller, and I don't believe this is going to be uniform,
[00:31:20] I don't believe, I think there's going to be more one-off to people not selling or not paying a commission.
[00:31:27] All right.
[00:31:27] Well, the buyer needs to know that if an entire neighborhood has paid 2.5% commission,
[00:31:36] I'm just using that number out there, right?
[00:31:39] So on all these homes, or let's say there's 10 houses for sale in a neighborhood,
[00:31:43] and they're all paying 2.5% and one does not pay 2.5%.
[00:31:49] That one house just costs 2.5% more.
[00:31:53] Yeah, exactly 100%.
[00:31:55] Absolutely, of course.
[00:31:57] Yeah.
[00:31:57] And then that's why selling agents, listing agents, rather, need to be very,
[00:32:02] they need to build a handle these conversations as well.
[00:32:05] Yeah, I agree.
[00:32:07] I think you're right.
[00:32:08] I think it'll be more one-off situations than the norm.
[00:32:12] I guess no one has the crystal ball, but we're hopeful, of course, that that's how it plays out.
[00:32:17] And I was curious to...
[00:32:19] You know, it's funny.
[00:32:20] I was going to share a quick story.
[00:32:21] So just to sort of piggyback off of Ryan's statement that he has gotten...
[00:32:28] The agents haven't received pushback, or as much pushback as they may be anticipated
[00:32:32] from those buyer clients.
[00:32:34] I met with a Compass agent recently.
[00:32:37] We just were having breakfast and I was asking him the same question.
[00:32:41] And he said, oh, he goes, it's kind of funny for the last eight years.
[00:32:44] He's been practicing eight years.
[00:32:46] I've only done it this way.
[00:32:48] He said, that's just how I was trained.
[00:32:49] He did start a Compass or somewhere else, but he said, that's...
[00:32:52] I've always told people I charged two and a half percent.
[00:32:55] That was his rate.
[00:32:56] And, you know, most of the time it's going to be covered by the seller, but sometimes it won't.
[00:33:00] And if so, you know, whatever the differences, I'm going to need you to make that up.
[00:33:04] And there's some creative ways to do it.
[00:33:05] You might have to write me a check.
[00:33:07] You might...
[00:33:07] We might be able to rosy...
[00:33:08] You know, he has...
[00:33:09] He gives the same sort of spiel that Ryan just gave.
[00:33:12] And I asked him, I said, how often does it happen where they have to come out of pocket?
[00:33:17] He goes, it happens.
[00:33:18] And I said, really, for the last eight years, how often?
[00:33:21] He's like, he does like 20 deals a year or so.
[00:33:24] He goes, about four, four out of 20 deals.
[00:33:26] I said, really, no kidding.
[00:33:28] Because he says I define my commission up front.
[00:33:30] Of course, the property, whatever the co-op commission is.
[00:33:32] He says, I can't control that.
[00:33:33] And he said, I said, have you ever had a problem getting paid from when it's that scenario?
[00:33:38] He said, never once.
[00:33:39] He goes, nobody cares.
[00:33:40] Everybody gets it.
[00:33:41] I explain it correctly.
[00:33:43] And I was really, really encouraged when I heard that.
[00:33:45] I said, oh, good.
[00:33:46] You know, and he goes, he goes, I don't know why everyone doesn't do it this way.
[00:33:50] I said, well, everyone's going to start doing it this way.
[00:33:52] But well, not everyone is.
[00:33:54] I think you're going to see people drop out.
[00:33:56] Well, that's true, too.
[00:33:57] It's a lot harder now to have that conversation.
[00:34:00] And if the onesy, tosy agents, the agents Ryan doesn't, doesn't bring on board.
[00:34:05] Are those are the agents that that are going to probably suffer the most because they get the least amount of training
[00:34:09] because they don't have enough time.
[00:34:10] They're probably have another job.
[00:34:12] And they may exit the business as well.
[00:34:15] So we're starting to see that are we have a holding company here that we're actually the largest holding company in the state.
[00:34:21] Just for agents that aren't practicing at the beginning of
[00:34:25] the end of last year, we had I think 700 agents in there.
[00:34:29] Today we have over a thousand.
[00:34:30] And that's that's crazy.
[00:34:32] And it's just people exiting the business.
[00:34:34] So the good news for those of you that are in that are fully in is this is great news for you
[00:34:39] because less competition, more market share to pick up.
[00:34:42] More serious buyers.
[00:34:43] I mean, less tire kickers, people with intent.
[00:34:47] And I think this is a really way for, you know, the different change to different check yourself.
[00:34:52] And how many times have an agent gone to a property to see it a property?
[00:34:57] And then they said, I talked to an agent the other day.
[00:34:59] She said she met a Zillow lead and the Zillow lead.
[00:35:04] You know, she got the whole team together, mortgage, inspector, everything.
[00:35:09] Okay.
[00:35:10] And on day two, the guy was like, well, my friends are telling me that or my family is telling me that you should be giving one and a half percent.
[00:35:19] You know, kick back or rebate or whatever.
[00:35:22] And you know, this is going to those conversations are going to be had before you even walking to the house moving forward.
[00:35:30] It's less time wasted.
[00:35:31] So there are a lot of good things I think that are going to come out of this settlement.
[00:35:35] It's not all bad.
[00:35:37] No, I don't, I think it, yeah, I don't think it's all bad either.
[00:35:40] I think it's just an adjustment period of teaching agents how to have those conversations in a way that makes sense.
[00:35:47] And I love this idea of role playing, of course, and having an AI role playing,
[00:35:52] a helper would really be great because you could just program the AI to respond, you know, and just keep pushing that person until
[00:36:00] until they have the skill developed where they can effectively communicate how it all works.
[00:36:04] And the good news too for buyers is that they were always paying this fees in some way.
[00:36:09] They just didn't see that they were paying it.
[00:36:12] So really, yes, are they going to have to come out of pocket sometimes?
[00:36:15] Maybe yes, and that's not fun.
[00:36:17] Nobody wants to write a check.
[00:36:18] But if you explain it at the beginning before you go do anything, you know, have you bought a home before?
[00:36:23] Well, you didn't write a check, but let me explain how it was probably baked into the price.
[00:36:27] So you were paying it some way.
[00:36:28] You're paying commissions on cars, you're paying fine fees.
[00:36:33] Like I think that the fact that people are really scared about this is a gross over estimation of what this is going to do.
[00:36:45] So I think, you know, and one year from now, no one's going to be talking about this.
[00:36:50] I agree.
[00:36:51] We'll all have kind of figured it out.
[00:36:53] And who knows, maybe maybe some of the lending partners will be able to finance a commission as a separate loan or may, you know, who knows?
[00:37:01] We don't know.
[00:37:01] There may be some creative solutions down the pike that would be pretty cool.
[00:37:05] That, you know, I'm sure all of the major lenders are trying to figure out right now.
[00:37:09] So they can be first to market someone will figure out a way to do it.
[00:37:13] That's compliant.
[00:37:14] I hope if it if it's possible, someone will figure out how to do it.
[00:37:17] And then everybody will do it.
[00:37:18] So it all hope is really not lost, even if you're terrified that, you know, hey, my first time home buyers can't afford to cut a $10,000 check.
[00:37:26] Yeah, I get it.
[00:37:27] But you just hang tight.
[00:37:29] There's solutions are on the way.
[00:37:31] And at the same time, you can tell them, you know, hey, everybody pays commission at some point or most, you know, most transactions have commissions.
[00:37:39] It just was hidden before or not as easily a scene.
[00:37:42] And you can just, you know, kind of work from there.
[00:37:46] Let's, I would love to talk as a little just a little bit about interest rates, not where we think they're going, but dealing with the reality of interest rates, you know, you said this at the beginning sort of, you know, we can, you know, dislike in Zillow doesn't big Zillow go away, right?
[00:38:01] Just just doesn't.
[00:38:03] So this idea of interest rates, we can hate the where rates are.
[00:38:07] And yet they are, they are.
[00:38:09] How do you coach around, you know, hey, somebody says, and, you know, and I don't, you know, the easy answer is, well, you, you date the rate you marry the home, which by the way, is a great thing to say.
[00:38:21] I'm not in any way suggesting that isn't great.
[00:38:23] It's great.
[00:38:24] But I'm curious how you are coaching your agents to deal with people that go, you know, I just want to wait for the some of those fed rate cuts.
[00:38:29] Yeah, I think that when the way you look at that is like twofold or multifold actually, I mean, my first mortgage on my home was exactly seven and a half percent.
[00:38:41] Okay.
[00:38:42] If you look at the recorded history of mortgage rates, I think it's like 40 years of, you know, digitally, whatever.
[00:38:51] And the chart that I saw, there's one 10 year period where rates were below 6%.
[00:38:58] Yeah.
[00:38:59] So if someone wants to hold like, you know, wants to, you know, shop the rate and they're waiting for interest rates to go down in a market like Austin where, you know, we had 37% appreciation.
[00:39:14] And every one year, 13% drop the next year.
[00:39:19] Well, I would say we're going to go up, I mean, conservatively, 5% of the next year.
[00:39:26] It doesn't make it you're not doing math, right?
[00:39:30] Yeah.
[00:39:31] If you're not looking at those scenarios.
[00:39:34] Yeah, I was at a, a conference not that long ago here in Chicago, we're lucky, the National Association.
[00:39:40] Well, it depends what you think of the National Association REALTORS, but, but they are technically located physically here in Chicago.
[00:39:46] So we get, you know, a little bit extra, maybe attention from them just because we're in the same city.
[00:39:51] And we got, we had, you know, one of their top attorneys speaking.
[00:39:55] And they were saying, you know, yeah, nobody likes where rates are.
[00:39:58] This is like six months ago.
[00:40:00] I wear rates were even a bit higher.
[00:40:01] But they said what you, what you need to remember is anybody who bought from you in the last three years is thrilled with you because you, the odds are,
[00:40:09] no matter where they bought, they probably have gone up at least a little bit in their value.
[00:40:15] So yes, the rates are tough today, but anyone who bought from you in last three or should have should be pretty happy.
[00:40:21] 
[00:40:21] And, and too, like when you were, got your first place and it was seven and, you know, seven percent or whatever that rate was.
[00:40:29] Because it was your first home, did you even think about that as a bad rate?
[00:40:33] I know, I, I had like a six percent something or other when 2000.
[00:40:36] And I was like, okay, I guess like I didn't know enough to even know that that was a thing.
[00:40:41] Like, we're coming from the illusion, right, of interest rates over this, you know, whatever it was two or three year period where they were in the high twos and low threes.
[00:40:52] Right. And, and so that it takes time for the mentality of the public to, you know, kind of sober up from that.
[00:41:03] And, and it's happening though. And so when I, I look at a good interest rate, I don't, I don't really see a place where we're going to be in the fives anymore.
[00:41:12] I mean, maybe a little bit, but like it's not going to get that much better and it should never get below five in my opinion.
[00:41:21] No, and it's, it's kind of hamstrings like I have a 2.9, whatever 2.95 or whatever it is.
[00:41:27] I can't move. I'm literally not that I want to, but I can't even if, I mean, I'd have to if I had to.
[00:41:35] But boy, I, you know, I love the rate, but I hate the fact that my next home is not going to be anywhere near that rate.
[00:41:44] I am now conditioned to think of this rate as, you know, a normal thing and it isn't.
[00:41:50] Yeah.
[00:41:50] And it's sort of, it is a bit of a hurdle that agents have to sort of get over in explaining, but you're right.
[00:41:57] It's all about the math. So if you can explain, yes, you know, you date the rate, you marry the home. Yes, we know that.
[00:42:03] And let's talk about where we see this home value. First of all, what are your goals?
[00:42:07] You know, how long do you plan on living here? Let's, let's really just kind of flesh it out.
[00:42:12] And by the way, are you going to refinance in the next two years?
[00:42:15] Probably at some next two to five years, there's going to be a rate reduction.
[00:42:20] Hopefully, of course, you don't promise that, but is it likely? Yeah, it's likely the Fed keeps telegraphing that at some point they're going to reduce rates.
[00:42:27] And maybe it will make sense for somebody to to refi at that point, but, but you're right.
[00:42:32] I think this is we as an as agents think about it way more than the public.
[00:42:37] And especially first time home buyers, yeah, I get people who aren't first time buyers.
[00:42:42] That's a bit of a hurdle. And you're going to get people that are just going to stay put because they don't want to lose that rate.
[00:42:48] Sure. But I think the first time home buyers, you know, really are still up for grabs.
[00:42:52] And I don't think there is connected to the rate as, you know, anyone else?
[00:42:56] Totally not. And I think, you know, as time goes, new cycles disappear. Right.
[00:43:02] You know, are they fade away? Rather. And, you know, people are just going to get used to the norm.
[00:43:07] It's like, like anything you deal with in life, it seemed hard at first. And then you just get used to it.
[00:43:14] Now, right, I want, I want to talk a little bit about what you offer to your agents.
[00:43:18] We talked about solving some of their problems, helping them automate some of their, you know, that you do utilizing tech.
[00:43:24] Because, and I know not, of course, not every listener is in the Austin area. I'm not in the Austin area.
[00:43:29] And even though you may not be in Ryan's area, I want you to listen to what he offers because you could find a version of this in your own.
[00:43:37] Local market. So even though, of course, Ryan once, as many Austin agents who, who fit that criteria to join him, I don't want you to tune out at this point because even though this may not impact you, because you're not in Texas, you, of course, can find a version of this locally.
[00:43:55] So tell us a little bit about what, and by the way, I think this is great because we're elevating what managing brokers are, well, I think the really good brokerages are always elevating the services they provide to agents.
[00:44:07] And Ryan has to compete with all the big firms too. So it does Ryan, you know, is Ryan's brand spyglass as well known as Colwell banker, of course not.
[00:44:17] So he's competing with, with bigger known brands. And he is still, you know, growing his brokerage. And he's winning on a lot of those against those, those bigger brands.
[00:44:27] And so tell us a little bit about, you know, when somebody actually joins you, what you, what you help do for them.
[00:44:32] Sure. And I love talking about this stuff because it's because my brand isn't as well known nationally. We were actually fairly well known now in Austin, but that we have to provide the best because we don't have caps here, right?
[00:44:47] And you don't, we don't cap, we, and, and glad we don't because we've been able to offer as much. So, you know, there's a tech which I won't even get into that. But, you know, we have three hours of training every single week.
[00:45:00] We have teams mastermind every two weeks. We have a photo and video shoot once a month where an agent can come in two or three times a year and get new lifestyle photos, they get bio videos, they can make reels on how to be a first time buyer.
[00:45:19] And then, you know, we have agent development groups where, you know, we coach the agents one on one or two on one and stuff, stuff, you know, among those lines. So when I look at what an agent, whatever agent wants, they, they either want leads, okay, or they want top notch support.
[00:45:37] So, oh, the other thing we just hired is a full time photographer and videographer. And what this does is an agent can click a button to have the photographer go out to their listing, he'll put the sign up, the lock box up, he'll do a drone shot, he'll get photos all for a price that is way less than if they were to hire outside company.
[00:46:00] Right, because you have your own in house guy, that's, that's great. I love that. That is really, really smart. And, and what's interesting is Ryan brought up a really good point because, you know, his brand isn't again, you know, and again, I'm not in any way, denigrating his brand, but certainly, you know, the average consumer is going to know a RE/MAX versus spyglass, but that being said, Ryan is like, oh, yeah, so we have to actually offer more. We actually have to do more and better to make up for that difference.
[00:46:29] And the good news is most brokerages don't offer half of what Ryan's offering, right? So it's, it's, how do you effectively communicate that brand to other agents, just out of curiosity?
[00:46:41] Well, you know, you always have agents that, you know, are the agents that think that they need the big brand in order to get national exposure. Now we're very fortunate in the sense that we just picked up a designation in your neck of the woods, which is leading RE.
[00:46:57] Sure. You know what I'm, yeah. Uh huh. Yeah. So, so that helps us a lot with saying, okay, we're, we're have a global presence where we can be on their websites. We, you know, the accumulation of real estate companies in leading RE does more volume than Compass or really, you know, the biggest. Yeah. So, I think that's one good thing.
[00:47:19] If you don't have something, if you're missing something, there are ways around it, you know, you just got to figure out what that was or what that is for us. Like it took me a couple of years to getting to leading RE, the real estate companies in the world. And if it's a soft, the water problems for us.
[00:47:36] Yeah, I love that. And I think this is really a great place to wrap up. I really want everybody to do two things. One is to subscribe to Ryan's podcast realty hack.com. Ryan's a tech guy. He's served on boards. He is very much in the tech space. It is kind of his, his passion.
[00:47:54] In addition to that, he's also a systems and process guy. So, because of the tech that allows for really effective and efficient systems. So, if you are an agent in that area of Austin and you are like, hey, I want better systems. I would like somebody to help me with some of my automation.
[00:48:12] I would like to, I'm good at this and I need help with with that. Ryan and his team would be a great, great opportunity to see if you could be a value to their firm. And of course, vice versa, spyglassrealty.com is the place to go to learn all about what they offer.
[00:48:30] Ryan is super easy to get a hold of and his team is really, really nice. We've dealt with them, of course, for the podcast and they're just wonderful. Couldn't recommend them more highly. So for those of you that are in that market, please reach out to spyglass to see if you'd be a good option.

All right, guys, enough about all of that. Let's get to the main event, my conversation with Ryan Rodenbeck. Today on the show, our guest is Ryan Rodenbeck from Spyglass Realty and also the host of Realty Hack Podcast. So let me tell you more about Ryan. Now, Ryan grew up in Louisiana and moved to Austin in 2001. He started Spyglass Realty in 2008, which would gosh, that had to have been a tough year to start a realty, but he did. And it was really created as a place to be as a solo agent with maybe a couple other agents. He was building this company. In 2015, he started to put pyrons in place to take his team into a real brokerage and he built systems and processes in place to grow the team. Now in 2019, he sold his last home by 2021. He had grown the brokerage from just a couple of agents to 42 agents. And in 2024, now he's up to almost 150 agents, which is insane. I'm a recruiter. I know how difficult that is to do. And he's doing it. And I'm glad he's not in my market because he'd be stealing our agents away. But he doesn't hire new agents. He doesn't hire part-time agents. And I'll tell you why, because his leadership team's main focus is hiring agents that have the potential to double or triple their production. Ryan has served in an advisory role for many real estate platforms, as well as other tech companies. He served on the customer advisory board for Workplace by Facebook and Genie.ai. Now he keeps up with current technology trends and is always looking for ways to contribute to automation and technology services. And I would like everybody to follow Ryan's podcast or visit Ryan's podcast, subscribe to it realtheac.com or whatever podcast app you're looking, look, just search for real T-Hack hit that subscribe button, but realtheac.com.

SpyglassRealty.com is where you go to learn about all things Spyglass and see if you'd be a good option and fit for their team and if they'd be a good fit for you. And yeah, so SpyglassRealty.com, RealtyHack, we will have links to all of this in the show notes. Ryan, welcome to the show. Wow, that was an introduction, man. I think I need you to go out with me here in Austin and then do that same speech. Well, I'll tell you. Yeah, I'd be happy to. I mean, there's, there's worse cities to come down and hang out. But thank you so much for being on the show. It's just a quick little funny thing. Well, not funny to Ryan, but funny to us. Poor Ryan, we were supposed to schedule, we were supposed to do the thing last week and I got a message about it. I didn't know it wasn't on my calendar. And so all of a sudden, Zana goes, person's been waiting for 20 minutes. Are you not showing up? And I'm like, what are you talking about? And so Ryan has been gracious enough. This really speaks to his character and just what a nice guy he is. Normally, Zana was like, I don't think he's going to want to reschedule because we just let him hang in for 20 minutes and he goes, hey, it happens. No problem. So we're grateful to have him today. So really, it was very, very grateful to Ryan for being so kind about that. And also, again, if you are a broker or a REALTOR in the Austin area, Ryan's a real good guy. So you should reach out to him if you're not getting what you need from your firm. But Ryan, I'd love to learn a little bit more about how you got started in real estate. I know you moved to Austin, 2001, but what brought you into real estate? You know, I owned a company that was filing claims for class action lawsuits, particularly on a siding manufacturer that had a warranty. And, you know, anyway, we would knock on doors or send out mailers, let people know that they had, there is a class actually lawsuit. They, in most cases, they were unaware of that. Then we moved from there to like trying to get more, you know, bulk business. So we, we, we hit up property managers. I was already investing in real estate at the time. And when that, the class action limitations ended in 2005, we were looking for something to get into. And real estate was because we were already working with property managers and companies, because I was an investor, you know, started in doing investment property. Sure. Yeah. Yeah, that makes sense. And, and so you started doing working with investors. And then how did you just, because you know, working with investors is, is, is a whole different animal, of course. There's lots of agents that do it, lots of agents that don't know how to do it. Yeah. Or wish they could learn how to do it. And, and, but you didn't, you didn't stop there. You basically created a team and then you decided, you know, this brokerage thing sounds pretty good. And you know, I would love to learn a little bit about how you transitioned from, you know, working with investors individually to eventually building this team and then saying, hey, I want to, I want to just run the brokerage. Yeah. So, you know, our original name of our company was Spiglass Realty and Investments. And the idea was to have a focus on investment properties. Sure. I wanted, I didn't want to be the Hokey REALTOR, you know, with their quotes there. And what I realized is investors are good to have, but it can be tough when the market's down. And so, you know, we, we did focus on investment property for a long time. We still do investment property. But I wanted to become a top producing real estate agent. So, about 2011ish, I went full force into some co-chains, you know, joined a coaching mastermind that was very intense. I said, you know, where can I get all of the habits that I want from a top producing agents and implement that into my own solid selling. It became a top producing listing agent. I was in a platinum top 50, nine years in a row and the ABJ, top 50, like three times. But yeah. And so, it was really having that mentality of, you know, I don't want to be the lazy REALTOR that just puts a sign in the yard. But let's be, let's look at every variable you can to help sell the home, got completely early into listings. And then, you know, employed these other services like, you know, I think I was a tiger leads customer back in the day and, you know, brought in a 2.7 million dollar list of buyer. Now, yeah, that was, I think, of my record completely. And that was an internet lead. Can you believe it? Yeah. And now that the number doesn't seem so high, but back in 2014, it was, right? And so, you know, I said to myself, I've got a handful of agents. I'm bringing in internet leads. What if I could do to building a team, what I did to manifesting being a top producing listing agent? And so, that's where I, you know, again, did the same thing that I did before. I've been going to conferences for 15 years, started meeting with the friends, you know, that I met conferences. You know, you can always get more information of people that aren't in your market. And, you know, they're just aligning with tech companies as well. Like I'm still like, I'm good friends with the owners of White Lopo and Ballet Boss and, you know, just really diving into these communities. Yeah, I love that. And you seem very coachable, I guess, would be maybe, would you say that's a secret of your success is being able to say, oh, you, you know, in your mastermind group, for example, it was a lot like, how do you guys do it? Oh, you do it that way. I'll try that. Absolutely. I mean, I think, you know, arrogance can be a roadblock to success, especially when you're trying to learn new things. Yeah, let's tell us before we get deeper into spyglass, we want to talk about your podcast because I obviously are listeners, are podcast listeners and we want to give them, you know, other podcast ideas. So tell us about Realty Hack. Yeah. So I started that about four years ago and, you know, I've, I've, because I've been, you know, networking and traveling to different real estate conferences over 15 years. I, I knew I had a list of people that I wanted to interview that are associates or friends of mine. And so I started Realty Hack podcast four years ago. I went through all the CEOs of like the prop tech companies by the both follow boss, REW, you know, what's interesting though is the shift when I started going like, my audience is mostly local. It's getting a little bit national right now, but still overwhelmingly local. And the, you know, I was really interested in the prop tech and the journey, that kind of how I built this of real estate technology. And what I found very interesting is that when I would interview someone local, a local prop producer agent, and it would just, I get three, four times the amount of engagement that then, you know, what I found is that the agent's interest is not always aligned with mine. And so, you know, and I'll be very honest with, with you is it, it is a, it's a recruitment tool. Of course. Yeah. Just being able to, you know, elevate your brand and putting all your stuff on Instagram with, you know, with terms of, in terms of, of making sure that when we have a podcast, we email it out. And then it's been probably one of the biggest facilitators of recruitment that I've ever done in my life. That's amazing. I, I need to do a better job of that myself because of course, this could be a better, a bigger recruiting tool for, for me as well. And when I first started the show, I wanted it to be sort of, I wanted it to, to be agnostic, right? Broker, or brokerage agnostic because I was asking these top producers who most of them work from our firm to sort of share their secrets. And I thought, well, they're probably not going to want me sharing their secrets and then promoting my business or my broker, or our brokerage. So I, I, and then I never kind of revisited it. And I think I'm to the point now where I think everyone's okay with me saying, oh, by the way, this is what I do. And so I have to start, I have to make that transition myself. But I will tell you from doing it for, I think this is our sixth or seventh year, that just by sheer force of being a podcast directed to other broke, or other agents that, you know, word has, has spread pretty rapidly in our local market as well. So our, our biggest concentration of listeners are also from our local market. Yeah. And, and here's the other thing, how it's evolved over the, over the years. In January of 23, we started our first Realty Hack summit, which we had 250 people, you know, agents, our agents outside agents. In 24, we had our second one, we had over 400 people. It was a total hit. We've had, you know, we have a headliner. We've had Jimmy Macon and, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, Britney Hodeck from Super fans. Um, you know, they were two of our keynotes last year at Anthony Machia and Howard Tager. So it's, it's really, and then, and then the next evolution, which is about to happen and now is we're about to release Realty Hack Academy, which is a Kajabi subscription base. Sure. You know, we're not even out yet, but it, we're, we're close. We're working on it for a year and a half. And to particularly because when we, and this came about is because we are the biggest solo flex team in Austin, the, the highest converting one. And so we, we were already doing all these lessons in Kajabi for our team. And so that's what you, when you go back, you might as well offer it to everyone. Yeah. Absolutely. And by, right away for everyone listening who doesn't undo, he said flex and you may now know what that is. Not every market has this. So Zillow has an option, what they call their flex program. They have premier agent and flex premier agent as you pay up front for the leads and whatever happens happens, flexes, you pay on the back end. And they are very selective about who they send those flex leads to here in our local market. There's only four teams out of 46,000 REALTORS that they send those leads to. So the reason I'm saying that is if you are a REALTOR in the Austin area, I guarantee there's only a few people that are getting these flex leads and Ryan and his team have them. So this is another reason to reach out to see if they may be a good fit. Yeah, I appreciate that. And we're, we're working with Zillow right now. It's one of those things that like, you know, he used to be, I used to be a Zillow hater. Okay. And I became a victim, joined him. But, you know, what I've learned is over the years is, you know, you cannot fight change. You need to embrace it. You can try, but it's not going to work. You can try. That's right. And with every any potential crisis or commission compression or whatever it is, you really need to figure out your angle. And we've come to have an excellent partnership with Zillow. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Zillow has been a good partner to our show as well. And I know not everybody feels positively about them. However, I will tell you everyone I've ever met in the Zillow organization has really been a nice, good human being. So I'm, I've not seen any of the monsters trying to ruin our industry, but I know people have their own opinions and that's okay. But what's nice to know is that they do have, you know, different types of lead options where if you're thinking, oh my gosh, I can't afford to pay $10,000 a month. Well, you may, you may be able to join a team that has access to these flex leads. It's very hard to get flex leads. And I'm like, we, like none of our agents would, would qualify for those here. We have 800 agents here at our firm. So I am very, very impressed that you are one of the Zillow's flex partners. And look, who doesn't need more leads everywhere. Yeah. So love it. So, you know, tell us now I am mostly impressed, Ryan, with your recruiting strategy, because, you know, everybody wants full-time agents, everybody wants, you know, high producing, listing agents, of course. But not everyone is able to say I want agents that want to double and triple their production because I know how to do that. Of course, brokerages might say that, but you, you actually walk that talk. So can I just ask you, what is the, and again, I know it's a lot of different things when somebody comes to you and says, I want to double and triple my production, that they need to do to end up with that result. But what, where do you usually start with somebody, when somebody comes to you and says, hey, I'm a full-time agent, I'm doing, let's say, 15 deals a year, I'm pretty modest production. I'd like to get to 30 deals a year. Where do you sort of start with that person? Well, we look at what their lead sources are. And, you know, there's two types of agents that we recruit. One, our agent's been a business, one to three years and have done one to three million likes. We, whatever we're so good with that, okay? Because we plug them into our lead sources and we plug them into our automation, like our sending out our monthly newsletter, putting people in the seller's suites and home bots and things like that, right? We also do a quarterly gift-giving thing where someone, agent can just come on our site and plug in how many bunch cakes they want to be delivered, right? And so that's probably the simplest way. Like getting an agent is between one to three million to six million or more. That's easy for us, but you have the lead sources. Now, the ones agents that are more veteran agents that are doing 12 to 15 deals a year, that is tougher because what I always tell agents is you don't want to take my leads when you have a pipeline that's full. Doesn't make financial sense, okay? So how we evaluate the agent's business, we figure out where their lead sources are, what's that one lever they're pulling and how can we help facilitate that so they can do more work in less time? So is that through email campaigns? If it's, let's say it's farming, right? We automate the farming process for them. Sure. And just whatever lever they're going to pull is what we double down on. And we've done it so many times that we know all the levers, I think, but the experience of working with other agents that way. But you know what you're saying right now is so logical and rational and seemingly, you know, sort of like common sense. Like we're going to, we're going to, you know, approach when I meet an agent who's interested in joining from like a consultant's perspective, where's your pain points? You know, where are you struggling? You can't do everything perfectly. Where are you falling a bit behind? And then Ryan and his team are like, okay, well, if we can do that for you, we will. And I love that approach. And I'm not sure. And I hate to say this because it sort of makes, makes a sound like the industry is, not doing a lot of this, but I don't know that the industry is doing a lot of this. Like as I'm thinking about it, I mean, I ask people when they join us, hey, where are your pain points? And then, you know, try to figure out if we can solve them. But I don't know that every brokerage does. I know brokerages will think, well, if one of your pain points is one of the things we just have, then great. But I like the idea of you guys really saying, we'll take that off your plate for you. That's not what most brokerages do. They might say we have resources to do it or, you know, maybe there's an admin that can help with X, Y, or Z. But I love the fact that you guys are tailor making basically a custom plan for somebody to take something that they aren't good at right off their plate. Yeah. And what we've done is really looked at our mission statement and core values. Our mission statement is we make good agents into great agents. Okay. Our core values, which we live and die by these are do the right thing, be smart, be all in and take action. So if an agent embodies those four core values, there really should be no reason that they can't succeed here. If they're now they're not being smart, they're not taking action or they're not all in, then any one of those things can cause failure, especially the taking action part. Yeah, absolutely. So when, so I like that idea. So if again, speaking to spyglass, which is Ryan's brokerage, if you're in the Austin area and you're managing broker or whoever the manager is for you is not saying, Hey, where are you struggling? Not not just, Hey, do you need, you know, obviously everybody wants more leads? That's a pretty pretty simple one. But if the manager, if the manager isn't coming over saying, Hey, where are you struggling right now? Let me see if I can take that off your plate, which most managing brokers are not going to do that. Then you should reach out to Ryan and see if, if, you know, you could, if you are can live those four values that he just described. He wants you because if you can do those four things, he can do the rest. So, so that's, that's pretty impressive. I'm, Ryan, I know you're, you're a big tech guy and I'd love to sort of get your thoughts on where you think the tech space is headed for REALTORS. I know there's a lot of concern about whether always has been concerned about tech sort of replacing agents. I don't, we don't have to have that conversation because so far it hasn't happened. But it's always a bit of a threat. But I'm curious on where you see technology developing to assist agents. Do you have any, any thoughts about, you know, where you're seeing some of your, your friends in the tech space working on new tools? Absolutely. I mean, I think we are seeing more efficiency from a measurement standpoint, you know, like we're, we're using a company called Maverick, which is an offshoot of wild elbow where we can see how many agents are, you know, making the first time appointments, keeping their appointments. And if they're not keeping appointments, why are they not, or if the people, if they're writing offers and they didn't go through, why are, why are they not writing more offers like that type of thing? So that's one of the things, right? The other thing that we're, we're talking about with them in particular, especially with our Realty Hack Academy is I'm talking with them about having at the end of a segment where an agent has gone through our videos and our questionnaires and they know how we want them to speak. Okay. Then they're doing live calls with an AI bought and the AI bought is, is it like the consumer? Oh, yeah, that's really slick. Wow. Yeah. That is, I love that. So you basically practice role playing. Absolutely. Yeah. With AI with AI and the other thing that I think we're going to see is AI in terms of like in your CRM, right, predictive analysts, looking at, you know, automations between when a property, you know, what a contract comes in, you know, sending out, you know, a AI being able to look at the different scenarios and then say, should you want to send this email or this email, right? I mean, this is progressing really, really fast. And I think that like you said, we're, there's a robot's never going to show a house, right? But it can make us more productive. And that's what we're trying to lean into and see who can give us the best efficiency, what tech teams are out there and how can we employ that with our brokerage? I love that. I'll tell you where I see a huge opportunity in the CRM space. And I know that we partner with real geeks here at our firm, follow up boss we've worked with in the past two. They were a big supporter of our show. And I know real geeks is working on this. And I'm sure they're all working on it. All the CRM providers, but this idea of prompt. So right now when we think about AI, it's mostly a question and answer sort of scenario. We ask a question. We get an answer very similar to like what the Greeks, we used to say the Oracle at Delphi like the all-knowing thing, you ask it a question, it gives you an answer. And that's great. I think the next iteration or certainly a different use case will be when the AI goes in just on its own starts looking at the data in the CRM, for example, all the contacts. And then starting to figure out reasons to reach out to each one of those contacts at different times. Obviously, the most obvious example would be like, obviously birthdays. Well, that already kind of, that's not really an AI thing. That's just a pretty simple algorithmic thing that most CRMs have. But what would be really cool is if, for example, it started looking deeper. And it started, you know, maybe tying together somebody's social media profiles, which some of them do that now. And starting to reason, hey, we know this, we just noticed this person went to Cabo on a vacation. Maybe a good time to reach out and say, how is the trip to Cabo? Right? Maybe more interpersonal things, but instead of the agent having to look to figure these things out, that stuff's going to be coming to us and say, hey, make these 10 calls today. That's genius. Yeah. I haven't even thought about like that. But like, all right, someone had a baby, someone's kid graduated from high school. These are all, you know, a life event that can trigger a sale, right? Yeah. Yeah. So I'm hopeful that that's kind of where it's headed, where there's going to be more about the system telling you what to do versus you going through and really trying to figure out who to contact. So I'm excited to see that piece of it. Now, let's talk about the NAR settlement, not the settlement itself, but just sort of the changes that you're seeing. You know, the big concern, of course, is right now with buyer representation. Now agents are going to have to explain how commissions worked, which I argue they should have done from the beginning, but whatever not everyone did. And I understand why, right? I get that it wasn't a conversation that was, I think it's absolutely essential, but a lot of agents didn't because they could say, well, it's really just coming out of the seller side, which isn't really the case, but whatever, it's sort of true, but not really. And here we are in this mess. So how are you training your agents to now have those buyer agency conversations to say, this is what I charge. Here's how it normally works. And here's how it might work differently. If, for example, we see a 0% co-op, well, I mean, you wouldn't explain it that way to the client, but, you know, if an agency is a 0% co-op, they're going to be very concerned. And we are starting to see those. I don't know if in your market, if you've seen any of those yet, but obviously that speaks to this buyer agency agreement situation. So how are you training agents to deal with things like that? So we're training them exactly as we have before. We're not seeing very much pushback on it. And I think that, you know, pre-subtlement and post-subtlement, the consumer is going to, you know, the average consumer buying home is going to know around the same amount. Right. And we were, we're, I mean, as before and after. Okay. The difference is now there's a possibility that it may have to come out of their pocket. Well, you know, I think when we talk to agents, we talked to agents to tell them to work with buyers, just explain, you know, I charge whatever X amount commission. Okay. And a lot of times most sellers will pay for a commission allotment. If it's not X amount, then it will come out of your pocket or we can roll it into closing cost. Okay. But I think as an industry, we have been very, very lax on how to explain a buyer contract. 100% And I don't know any other industry that's been so scared of explaining a contract. I would say the only one that comes to mind is certain insurance products where like fees and commissions are kind of hidden. Other than that, it is not that common. Well, right. And in the insurance, you know, those, that's complicated. What we're doing is really not that complicated. Now, especially Fannie Mae says that that's not going to be, you know, commissions not going to be part of the allowable closing costs, which I called that a year ago. I knew that was going to happen. So, you know, I think when you talk to consumers and you're explaining this, if they have the question, well, what happens if, you know, they're not paying any commission? Well, then, you know, you'll have to pay, you know, and look, we have the ability to go down. Okay. We can't go up. Let me say I'm going to go down to reduce our commission. So I think any good agent is going to look at every scenario and say, what's best for my client? But what's what a best for my client? And how can I still get paid? The reality is is that I believe commissions are going to go down 10, maybe 20%. Okay. It's okay because in this town, I believe we're going to see 10% value increase. So whatever we lose, we're going to make it up in a couple of years. We just have to be diligent about how we explain our services, add value to the clients and give them different options. I mean, the reality is that if a seller, and I don't believe this is going to be uniform, I don't believe, I think there's going to be more one-off to people not selling or not paying a commission. All right. Well, the buyer needs to know that if an entire neighborhood has paid 2.5% commission, I'm just using that number out there, right? So on all these homes, or let's say there's 10 houses for sale in a neighborhood, and they're all paying 2.5% and one does not pay 2.5%. That one house just costs 2.5% more. Yeah, exactly 100%. Absolutely, of course. Yeah. And then that's why selling agents, listing agents, rather, need to be very, they need to build a handle these conversations as well. Yeah, I agree. I think you're right. I think it'll be more one-off situations than the norm. I guess no one has the crystal ball, but we're hopeful, of course, that that's how it plays out. And I was curious to... You know, it's funny. I was going to share a quick story. So just to sort of piggyback off of Ryan's statement that he has gotten... The agents haven't received pushback, or as much pushback as they may be anticipated from those buyer clients. I met with a Compass agent recently. We just were having breakfast and I was asking him the same question. And he said, oh, he goes, it's kind of funny for the last eight years. He's been practicing eight years. I've only done it this way. He said, that's just how I was trained. He did start a Compass or somewhere else, but he said, that's... I've always told people I charged two and a half percent. That was his rate. And, you know, most of the time it's going to be covered by the seller, but sometimes it won't. And if so, you know, whatever the differences, I'm going to need you to make that up. And there's some creative ways to do it. You might have to write me a check. You might... We might be able to rosy... You know, he has... He gives the same sort of spiel that Ryan just gave. And I asked him, I said, how often does it happen where they have to come out of pocket? He goes, it happens. And I said, really, for the last eight years, how often? He's like, he does like 20 deals a year or so. He goes, about four, four out of 20 deals. I said, really, no kidding. Because he says I define my commission up front. Of course, the property, whatever the co-op commission is. He says, I can't control that. And he said, I said, have you ever had a problem getting paid from when it's that scenario? He said, never once. He goes, nobody cares. Everybody gets it. I explain it correctly. And I was really, really encouraged when I heard that. I said, oh, good. You know, and he goes, he goes, I don't know why everyone doesn't do it this way. I said, well, everyone's going to start doing it this way. But well, not everyone is. I think you're going to see people drop out. Well, that's true, too. It's a lot harder now to have that conversation. And if the onesy, tosy agents, the agents Ryan doesn't, doesn't bring on board. Are those are the agents that that are going to probably suffer the most because they get the least amount of training because they don't have enough time. They're probably have another job. And they may exit the business as well. So we're starting to see that are we have a holding company here that we're actually the largest holding company in the state. Just for agents that aren't practicing at the beginning of the end of last year, we had I think 700 agents in there. Today we have over a thousand. And that's that's crazy. And it's just people exiting the business. So the good news for those of you that are in that are fully in is this is great news for you because less competition, more market share to pick up. More serious buyers. I mean, less tire kickers, people with intent. And I think this is a really way for, you know, the different change to different check yourself. And how many times have an agent gone to a property to see it a property? And then they said, I talked to an agent the other day. She said she met a Zillow lead and the Zillow lead. You know, she got the whole team together, mortgage, inspector, everything. Okay. And on day two, the guy was like, well, my friends are telling me that or my family is telling me that you should be giving one and a half percent. You know, kick back or rebate or whatever. And you know, this is going to those conversations are going to be had before you even walking to the house moving forward. It's less time wasted. So there are a lot of good things I think that are going to come out of this settlement. It's not all bad. No, I don't, I think it, yeah, I don't think it's all bad either. I think it's just an adjustment period of teaching agents how to have those conversations in a way that makes sense. And I love this idea of role playing, of course, and having an AI role playing, a helper would really be great because you could just program the AI to respond, you know, and just keep pushing that person until until they have the skill developed where they can effectively communicate how it all works. And the good news too for buyers is that they were always paying this fees in some way. They just didn't see that they were paying it. So really, yes, are they going to have to come out of pocket sometimes? Maybe yes, and that's not fun. Nobody wants to write a check. But if you explain it at the beginning before you go do anything, you know, have you bought a home before? Well, you didn't write a check, but let me explain how it was probably baked into the price. So you were paying it some way. You're paying commissions on cars, you're paying fine fees. Like I think that the fact that people are really scared about this is a gross over estimation of what this is going to do. So I think, you know, and one year from now, no one's going to be talking about this. I agree. We'll all have kind of figured it out. And who knows, maybe maybe some of the lending partners will be able to finance a commission as a separate loan or may, you know, who knows? We don't know. There may be some creative solutions down the pike that would be pretty cool. That, you know, I'm sure all of the major lenders are trying to figure out right now. So they can be first to market someone will figure out a way to do it. That's compliant. I hope if it if it's possible, someone will figure out how to do it. And then everybody will do it. So it all hope is really not lost, even if you're terrified that, you know, hey, my first time home buyers can't afford to cut a $10,000 check. Yeah, I get it. But you just hang tight. There's solutions are on the way. And at the same time, you can tell them, you know, hey, everybody pays commission at some point or most, you know, most transactions have commissions. It just was hidden before or not as easily a scene. And you can just, you know, kind of work from there. Let's, I would love to talk as a little just a little bit about interest rates, not where we think they're going, but dealing with the reality of interest rates, you know, you said this at the beginning sort of, you know, we can, you know, dislike in Zillow doesn't big Zillow go away, right? Just just doesn't. So this idea of interest rates, we can hate the where rates are. And yet they are, they are. How do you coach around, you know, hey, somebody says, and, you know, and I don't, you know, the easy answer is, well, you, you date the rate you marry the home, which by the way, is a great thing to say. I'm not in any way suggesting that isn't great. It's great. But I'm curious how you are coaching your agents to deal with people that go, you know, I just want to wait for the some of those fed rate cuts. Yeah, I think that when the way you look at that is like twofold or multifold actually, I mean, my first mortgage on my home was exactly seven and a half percent. Okay. If you look at the recorded history of mortgage rates, I think it's like 40 years of, you know, digitally, whatever. And the chart that I saw, there's one 10 year period where rates were below 6%. Yeah. So if someone wants to hold like, you know, wants to, you know, shop the rate and they're waiting for interest rates to go down in a market like Austin where, you know, we had 37% appreciation. And every one year, 13% drop the next year. Well, I would say we're going to go up, I mean, conservatively, 5% of the next year. It doesn't make it you're not doing math, right? Yeah. If you're not looking at those scenarios. Yeah, I was at a, a conference not that long ago here in Chicago, we're lucky, the National Association. Well, it depends what you think of the National Association REALTORS, but, but they are technically located physically here in Chicago. So we get, you know, a little bit extra, maybe attention from them just because we're in the same city. And we got, we had, you know, one of their top attorneys speaking. And they were saying, you know, yeah, nobody likes where rates are. This is like six months ago. I wear rates were even a bit higher. But they said what you, what you need to remember is anybody who bought from you in the last three years is thrilled with you because you, the odds are, no matter where they bought, they probably have gone up at least a little bit in their value. So yes, the rates are tough today, but anyone who bought from you in last three or should have should be pretty happy. And, and too, like when you were, got your first place and it was seven and, you know, seven percent or whatever that rate was. Because it was your first home, did you even think about that as a bad rate? I know, I, I had like a six percent something or other when 2000. And I was like, okay, I guess like I didn't know enough to even know that that was a thing. Like, we're coming from the illusion, right, of interest rates over this, you know, whatever it was two or three year period where they were in the high twos and low threes. Right. And, and so that it takes time for the mentality of the public to, you know, kind of sober up from that. And, and it's happening though. And so when I, I look at a good interest rate, I don't, I don't really see a place where we're going to be in the fives anymore. I mean, maybe a little bit, but like it's not going to get that much better and it should never get below five in my opinion. No, and it's, it's kind of hamstrings like I have a 2.9, whatever 2.95 or whatever it is. I can't move. I'm literally not that I want to, but I can't even if, I mean, I'd have to if I had to. But boy, I, you know, I love the rate, but I hate the fact that my next home is not going to be anywhere near that rate. I am now conditioned to think of this rate as, you know, a normal thing and it isn't. Yeah. And it's sort of, it is a bit of a hurdle that agents have to sort of get over in explaining, but you're right. It's all about the math. So if you can explain, yes, you know, you date the rate, you marry the home. Yes, we know that. And let's talk about where we see this home value. First of all, what are your goals? You know, how long do you plan on living here? Let's, let's really just kind of flesh it out. And by the way, are you going to refinance in the next two years? Probably at some next two to five years, there's going to be a rate reduction. Hopefully, of course, you don't promise that, but is it likely? Yeah, it's likely the Fed keeps telegraphing that at some point they're going to reduce rates. And maybe it will make sense for somebody to to refi at that point, but, but you're right. I think this is we as an as agents think about it way more than the public. And especially first time home buyers, yeah, I get people who aren't first time buyers. That's a bit of a hurdle. And you're going to get people that are just going to stay put because they don't want to lose that rate. Sure. But I think the first time home buyers, you know, really are still up for grabs. And I don't think there is connected to the rate as, you know, anyone else? Totally not. And I think, you know, as time goes, new cycles disappear. Right. You know, are they fade away? Rather. And, you know, people are just going to get used to the norm. It's like, like anything you deal with in life, it seemed hard at first. And then you just get used to it. Now, right, I want, I want to talk a little bit about what you offer to your agents. We talked about solving some of their problems, helping them automate some of their, you know, that you do utilizing tech. Because, and I know not, of course, not every listener is in the Austin area. I'm not in the Austin area. And even though you may not be in Ryan's area, I want you to listen to what he offers because you could find a version of this in your own. Local market. So even though, of course, Ryan once, as many Austin agents who, who fit that criteria to join him, I don't want you to tune out at this point because even though this may not impact you, because you're not in Texas, you, of course, can find a version of this locally. So tell us a little bit about what, and by the way, I think this is great because we're elevating what managing brokers are, well, I think the really good brokerages are always elevating the services they provide to agents. And Ryan has to compete with all the big firms too. So it does Ryan, you know, is Ryan's brand spyglass as well known as Colwell banker, of course not. So he's competing with, with bigger known brands. And he is still, you know, growing his brokerage. And he's winning on a lot of those against those, those bigger brands. And so tell us a little bit about, you know, when somebody actually joins you, what you, what you help do for them. Sure. And I love talking about this stuff because it's because my brand isn't as well known nationally. We were actually fairly well known now in Austin, but that we have to provide the best because we don't have caps here, right? And you don't, we don't cap, we, and, and glad we don't because we've been able to offer as much. So, you know, there's a tech which I won't even get into that. But, you know, we have three hours of training every single week. We have teams mastermind every two weeks. We have a photo and video shoot once a month where an agent can come in two or three times a year and get new lifestyle photos, they get bio videos, they can make reels on how to be a first time buyer. And then, you know, we have agent development groups where, you know, we coach the agents one on one or two on one and stuff, stuff, you know, among those lines. So when I look at what an agent, whatever agent wants, they, they either want leads, okay, or they want top notch support. So, oh, the other thing we just hired is a full time photographer and videographer. And what this does is an agent can click a button to have the photographer go out to their listing, he'll put the sign up, the lock box up, he'll do a drone shot, he'll get photos all for a price that is way less than if they were to hire outside company. Right, because you have your own in house guy, that's, that's great. I love that. That is really, really smart. And, and what's interesting is Ryan brought up a really good point because, you know, his brand isn't again, you know, and again, I'm not in any way, denigrating his brand, but certainly, you know, the average consumer is going to know a RE/MAX versus spyglass, but that being said, Ryan is like, oh, yeah, so we have to actually offer more. We actually have to do more and better to make up for that difference. And the good news is most brokerages don't offer half of what Ryan's offering, right? So it's, it's, how do you effectively communicate that brand to other agents, just out of curiosity? Well, you know, you always have agents that, you know, are the agents that think that they need the big brand in order to get national exposure. Now we're very fortunate in the sense that we just picked up a designation in your neck of the woods, which is leading RE. Sure. You know what I'm, yeah. Uh huh. Yeah. So, so that helps us a lot with saying, okay, we're, we're have a global presence where we can be on their websites. We, you know, the accumulation of real estate companies in leading RE does more volume than Compass or really, you know, the biggest. Yeah. So, I think that's one good thing. If you don't have something, if you're missing something, there are ways around it, you know, you just got to figure out what that was or what that is for us. Like it took me a couple of years to getting to leading RE, the real estate companies in the world. And if it's a soft, the water problems for us. Yeah, I love that. And I think this is really a great place to wrap up. I really want everybody to do two things. One is to subscribe to Ryan's podcast realty hack.com. Ryan's a tech guy. He's served on boards. He is very much in the tech space. It is kind of his, his passion. In addition to that, he's also a systems and process guy.
