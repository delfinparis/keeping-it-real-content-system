[00:01:19] Today's episode is brought to you by corded.io.
[00:01:23] Are you looking for agents to join your brokerage team?
[00:01:26] Now, as a real estate recruiter,
[00:01:28] I can tell you the answer is always yes.
[00:01:31] But most agents aren't looking to move right now.
[00:01:33] So how do you know who to contact?
[00:01:36] Well, what if I were to tell you
[00:01:37] there's a recruiting and retention tool
[00:01:38] powered by artificial intelligence
[00:01:41] that shows you exactly which agents in your local market
[00:01:44] are looking to leave their brokerage right now
[00:01:46] and which agents at your own firm
[00:01:49] are also looking to leave you.
[00:01:51] Now, I've been recruiting REALTORS for 15 years
[00:01:54] and I've hired over 2000 agents.
[00:01:56] I can tell you with no exaggeration,
[00:01:59] this is the tool I've been waiting for.
[00:02:00] Corded's AI looks for trends across dozens of variables
[00:02:04] for each agent in your market
[00:02:05] and shows you which agents they believe are likely to move.
[00:02:09] Not only does it do that,
[00:02:10] but corded's AI went and visited my recruiting website
[00:02:13] and read everything I offer.
[00:02:15] So now when I'm recruiting,
[00:02:17] corded's AI tells me exactly what to say
[00:02:20] based on that agent's needs
[00:02:21] and what my brokerage can offer.
[00:02:23] It even writes emails for me.
[00:02:25] I've never seen anything like it
[00:02:27] and I use it every single day.
[00:02:30] Now, if you are looking to grow your brokerage,
[00:02:32] corded.io is the best tool out there.

[00:04:08] Without further ado, let's get into it.
[00:04:11] Welcome back.
[00:04:12] This is the third installment of the inner game
[00:04:15] of real estate success.
[00:04:17] And I'm thrilled that you're tuning in.
[00:04:19] And today's conversation will serve as a phenomenal stand alone.
[00:04:26] But I need to encourage you
[00:04:29] to get the most out of today's conversation,
[00:04:31] to go back and listen to the episode published
[00:04:34] on June 26th.
[00:04:37] Because that is a conversation that deep dives
[00:04:40] into the topic known as the upper limit problem
[00:04:44] or also known as fear of success.
[00:04:49] That conversation is going to provide you
[00:04:51] with an incredible framework and foundation
[00:04:53] to get every single nugget and ounce of value
[00:04:57] out of today's conversation.
[00:05:01] And the way I'd like to begin today's conversation
[00:05:05] is with the story.
[00:05:07] And I want you to begin to imagine for a moment
[00:05:11] and really just begin to listen to see what elements,
[00:05:17] what characteristics,
[00:05:18] what aspects of this story resonate with you.
[00:05:23] The story's about a client of mine.
[00:05:25] A client of mine is the oldest of four.
[00:05:29] And he is the oldest of four.
[00:05:31] Two parents, one of which came from immigrant parents.
[00:05:35] Her parents, his mother, his mother's parents came over
[00:05:39] when they were seven or eight years old from Eastern Europe.
[00:05:44] And her entire upbringing,
[00:05:47] there was always enough money to go around
[00:05:50] to take care of her needs as well as her two sisters needs.
[00:05:54] Yet dad was always working, always working.
[00:05:59] Dad, on the other hand, this client's dad, was one of eight.
[00:06:07] And as you can imagine, his mother, my client's grandmother,
[00:06:11] became a brilliant mind at mastering the skill
[00:06:17] of pinching pennies.
[00:06:19] One of the most creative ways she indulged her mind each week
[00:06:24] was finding an opportunity to see how long and how far
[00:06:27] she could stretch to an acasceral
[00:06:29] until her husband's paycheck came in
[00:06:32] and she could buy another round of groceries
[00:06:34] that would hopefully last the week to feed all eight children.
[00:06:38] My point is this, my client's parents always had their needs met
[00:06:45] yet money was tight.
[00:06:49] Both of their respective fathers had a tenacious work ethic,
[00:06:53] always, always working.
[00:06:55] And this is especially true in his dad's side
[00:06:57] because his mother was a nurse for a couple of years
[00:07:00] and into his upbringing,
[00:07:02] but eventually had to leave that job to stay at home full time
[00:07:05] to, as you can imagine, raise eight kids.
[00:07:10] Well, we fast forward when my client's parents met
[00:07:13] fell in love, got married,
[00:07:15] the whole shebang happily ever after,
[00:07:17] which hey, they've been married,
[00:07:18] who, 35 plus years if I recall correctly,
[00:07:21] and that's incredible.
[00:07:24] Dad took a job.
[00:07:27] All he had known since early high school
[00:07:29] and tools early 20s was construction,
[00:07:31] building houses, fixing things,
[00:07:34] and understanding that that was not a viable option,
[00:07:37] a sustainable option for the future him and his wife wanted.
[00:07:41] He took a sales job,
[00:07:43] a 100% commission-based sales job.
[00:07:48] And for the next 30 years,
[00:07:52] he worked at, excelled at that job.
[00:07:57] It remained 100% commission-based,
[00:08:01] all 30 years,
[00:08:04] where he ultimately went on to raise four wonderful children,
[00:08:08] including my client, the oldest of those four.
[00:08:13] And in my client's words,
[00:08:17] reflecting back, his needs were met,
[00:08:22] a good majority of his wants were met and satisfied.
[00:08:27] Yet there was always an undercurrent of scarcity
[00:08:31] and anxiety around money.
[00:08:34] There were many moments he recalled in which his parents
[00:08:37] said yes when he asked for things he wanted,
[00:08:40] but equally if not more moments in which they said no.
[00:08:45] And there were a couple particular moments in hindsight,
[00:08:48] specifically the .com burst of 2000,
[00:08:51] the housing market crash and recession of 0708 into 09ish,
[00:08:55] in which upon reflection my client looks back
[00:08:58] and he could just feel the palpable tension,
[00:09:03] lacks scarcity, anxiety, fear related to money
[00:09:08] or lack thereof.
[00:09:11] There were countless years of his upbringing
[00:09:15] when his dad was up at 4am, home at 6pm,
[00:09:20] and a couple times a week might have went back
[00:09:22] into the office to work and get shit done.
[00:09:27] And one of his dad's mantras was always,
[00:09:31] I'll sleep when I'm dead, phenomenal work ethic,
[00:09:37] ambitious, tenacious, committed, relentless.
[00:09:43] The picture I'm attempting to paint for you
[00:09:45] is that there was a generational pattern
[00:09:48] of scarcity lack around money.
[00:09:51] The only known solution being if I want to earn more,
[00:09:55] I have to work more.
[00:09:57] This client's father watched his father relentlessly work
[00:10:01] to feed eight mouths.
[00:10:03] My client's father embodied that tirelessly worked
[00:10:08] in the pursuit of being able to provide his four children
[00:10:12] and to create a wonderful life.
[00:10:15] As you can imagine, the generational characteristics
[00:10:19] and relationship with money were passed down to my client.
[00:10:26] And my client, fortunately or unfortunately,
[00:10:29] was bitten by the entrepreneurial bug quite young.
[00:10:32] He was mowing yards, selling things on the sidewalk
[00:10:35] from a very young age, had his own lawn care company
[00:10:39] business throughout high school.
[00:10:41] God, into the personal training round
[00:10:43] became a personal trainer, a group fitness instructor,
[00:10:46] ultimately a coach, and then has been in the coaching,
[00:10:48] consulting and speaking industry for a very long time.
[00:10:53] When he officially left his clasped corporate stop
[00:10:58] to go all in on his side hustle,
[00:11:03] for five years in a row,
[00:11:08] he made the exact same amount of money.
[00:11:15] For five consecutive years in a row,
[00:11:20] the number of hours he averaged per week of work
[00:11:25] went from 40-ish to 50-ish to 60, 65,
[00:11:35] 70 hours per week on average at his peak.
[00:11:40] Throughout this five year process,
[00:11:42] he pivoted multiple times in terms of who his ideal demographic
[00:11:48] target audience in niche work.
[00:11:50] He read the books he took, the courses he attended,
[00:11:53] the events, he invested handsomely in multiple
[00:11:57] so-called business coaches and gurus.
[00:12:01] He wrote books, he built online courses,
[00:12:04] he created communities, he kept doing more and more
[00:12:08] and more in hopes that his income would finally break
[00:12:14] through some arbitrary ceiling or threshold,
[00:12:17] and he'd finally feel that elusive sense of peace,
[00:12:23] happiness and contentment.
[00:12:25] He operated with the belief that the harder I worked,
[00:12:29] the more I worked, the more I will make,
[00:12:32] the more happiness and peace I will feel the less anxiety,
[00:12:36] tension and fear I will experience.
[00:12:39] But as I shared again, five consecutive years,
[00:12:42] the only thing that increased was the amount of stress,
[00:12:47] anxiety and number of hours he worked,
[00:12:50] as well as the exhaustion, the things that decrease
[00:12:53] were the amounts of sleep, the quality of his marriage,
[00:12:57] the quality of his well-being,
[00:12:59] the quality of his relationship with money,
[00:13:02] friends and family.
[00:13:03] And oh, by the way, the income more or less never moved
[00:13:07] for five consecutive years plus or minus the same $10,000
[00:13:10] at the end of the year.
[00:13:14] And it really begged the question,
[00:13:17] why was he doing all of this?
[00:13:19] What was the cost?
[00:13:20] Was it worth it?
[00:13:24] My client had taken the same pattern of emotions,
[00:13:29] stress and anxiety.
[00:13:32] My client had taken the same learned beliefs.
[00:13:35] I need to work more to earn more.
[00:13:37] Then I'll be happy that had been passed down
[00:13:42] from generation to generation.
[00:13:46] And he replicated that.
[00:13:49] Almost to a T for five consecutive years,
[00:13:53] his entrepreneurship journey again marked by a plateau
[00:13:57] and income with increasing levels of stress,
[00:14:01] fear, anxiety, poor self-care, poor relationships,
[00:14:05] his marriage ultimately crumbling and ending in divorce.
[00:14:11] And all of this, A, learned, passed on generationally,
[00:14:16] but B, all of this forming what I now refer to as
[00:14:22] the origin of destructive mindset programs,
[00:14:26] these patterns of thinking, feeling, believing and behaving
[00:14:29] that are deployed by our subconscious mind,
[00:14:34] designed to keep us safe.
[00:14:37] Remember, your subconscious has one primary goal
[00:14:42] to keep you safe.
[00:14:45] The way that it keeps you safe is keeping you stuck
[00:14:49] in patterns and experiences of familiarity,
[00:14:53] predictability and certainty.
[00:14:57] So you might be wondering,
[00:14:59] how, for my client, did remaining stuck
[00:15:04] at that particular income threshold for five years,
[00:15:08] keep him safe?
[00:15:10] How did it benefit him?
[00:15:13] Well, here's where we bring in another layer of complexity.
[00:15:18] Given as human beings, our subconscious has one primary objective.
[00:15:23] Again, to keep us safe, that means as a result,
[00:15:26] all of us human beings have three core fears,
[00:15:30] fear of judgment, abandonment and rejection.
[00:15:33] And that's because centuries ago, if you were judged,
[00:15:38] rejected and ultimately abandoned by your tribe,
[00:15:42] you either starve to death,
[00:15:44] or you were eaten by a saber-toothed tiger.
[00:15:47] And although the literal threat of judgment, rejection,
[00:15:52] abandonment isn't an actual threat to our well-being,
[00:15:54] life or death, in maybe 99.9% of circumstances,
[00:15:58] today, the visceral fear experience is as real and prominent
[00:16:04] as palpable as ever before.
[00:16:09] So here's where things get interesting.
[00:16:12] My client, as I mentioned, had been bitten
[00:16:15] by the entrepreneur bug from a very young age.
[00:16:18] He had all these grand aspirations to make a ton of money,
[00:16:21] his set site on crossing that seven figure per year threshold.
[00:16:26] He's doing all the things, he's writing books,
[00:16:29] creating courses, hiring coaches, paid advertising,
[00:16:31] social media, you name it, he probably tried it in some way,
[00:16:35] shape or form.
[00:16:36] He's got these big aspirations,
[00:16:38] but it felt like he kept running into an invisible wall,
[00:16:42] a glass ceiling, as if this invisible gravitational-like force
[00:16:46] was creating a form of resistance, holding him back,
[00:16:50] because there was an underlying belief
[00:16:54] that it wasn't safe to scale his income to the next level.
[00:16:58] And this could be an entire conversation in of itself,
[00:17:00] but the key point I want to get to is that safety
[00:17:03] or that lack thereof was rooted in a fear of judgment,
[00:17:09] rejection and abandonment from his parents,
[00:17:13] specifically from his father.
[00:17:15] My client observed for three decades,
[00:17:18] his father worked his ass off 12, 14, 16, even 18 hour days
[00:17:25] all to provide for his siblings, his mom, that family,
[00:17:29] all to provide what my client ultimately described
[00:17:32] as a wonderful childhood and upbringing with opportunities.
[00:17:37] How dare my client reach a point
[00:17:41] where he earns more money than his dad?
[00:17:44] That's so disrespectful.
[00:17:47] How dare my client go work for himself,
[00:17:50] doing something he loves, not that his dad didn't love what he did.
[00:17:56] But then in a significantly shorter amount of time,
[00:17:58] start making significantly more money.
[00:18:00] How dare he?
[00:18:01] There was such an existential threat
[00:18:04] to creating tension, resentment, rejection,
[00:18:08] judgment and abandonment between my client
[00:18:10] and the relationship he had with his dad
[00:18:12] that he found himself stuck in a pattern
[00:18:15] of sneaky quiet self conscious self sabotage
[00:18:20] until he did the work necessary to dismantle that pattern.
[00:18:25] Now here's where things become eerie.
[00:18:28] My client told me.
[00:18:31] That the income amount he made
[00:18:33] and was stuck out for those five years
[00:18:36] was almost identical to the cumulative income
[00:18:40] his dad and mom made each year.
[00:18:42] He still is a vivid memory
[00:18:46] of seeing the amount of money his dad made
[00:18:49] when filling out a fast-follow form for college aid
[00:18:53] when he was preparing to go off to college.
[00:18:55] And he could roughly estimate based on his mom's industry
[00:18:58] what she earned in a given year.
[00:19:00] And if you add those numbers together,
[00:19:02] that is where my client remains stuck
[00:19:04] for those five consecutive years.
[00:19:08] And it wasn't until he identified this collection
[00:19:11] of destructive mindset programs
[00:19:13] that you're gonna become privy to
[00:19:15] and have a much deeper understanding
[00:19:16] of by the end of today's conversation
[00:19:19] that alongside his own mindset and performance coach,
[00:19:22] he was able to break the cycle, dismantle the patterns
[00:19:25] soar above that threshold
[00:19:27] while simultaneously working less
[00:19:30] and experiencing significantly more piece, fulfillment,
[00:19:34] presence, joy, contentment,
[00:19:37] and exponentially increasing the quality of his life.
[00:19:42] And you may wonder,
[00:19:46] how do I have such an intimate knowing
[00:19:49] and understanding of this experience?
[00:19:52] Because the client I described as myself,
[00:19:56] that was my story.
[00:19:58] For five years held back
[00:20:01] by the weight of outdated beliefs and behaviors,
[00:20:03] emotional reactions that weren't even mine,
[00:20:06] but they were all I knew.
[00:20:09] Feeling as if I was running into a brick wall,
[00:20:12] banging my head against the wall year after year
[00:20:14] for five consecutive years wondering what?
[00:20:18] The fuck.
[00:20:21] Do I need to do to ever change my results?
[00:20:26] And as I alluded to it,
[00:20:28] wasn't until I hired my own mindset coach,
[00:20:30] I was able to see this more clearly than ever before
[00:20:34] and then do the work, take the action necessary to break free.
[00:20:39] And that's what we're gonna learn more about
[00:20:41] in today's conversation.
[00:20:42] So if you're still with me, buckle up
[00:20:44] because you're in for a journey,
[00:20:46] you're in for 15 to 18 more minutes,
[00:20:50] of probably feeling like you're gonna be drinking
[00:20:52] through a garden hose.
[00:20:53] That's okay because you can go back and relisten to this.
[00:20:57] And what I really wanna do is tie in a little bit
[00:21:00] of the key points from last episode,
[00:21:02] all about the upper limit problem,
[00:21:04] use that as a springboard to talk
[00:21:05] about destructive mindset programs.
[00:21:07] And I'll do that by beginning with a few simple questions.
[00:21:11] You the listener, do you know,
[00:21:15] do you feel do you believe that you're capable
[00:21:18] of selling and earning more?
[00:21:22] Do you know what to do to sell, scale and earn more?
[00:21:29] Yeah, I thought so.
[00:21:31] And if you truly don't,
[00:21:32] you can quickly fill those knowledge gaps
[00:21:34] from another episode on this podcast, Google,
[00:21:37] or all of our beloved best friends, chat GPT.
[00:21:40] But the point is this, you don't have
[00:21:42] a lack of information problem.
[00:21:45] You have a mindset problem.
[00:21:47] And if you recall from last episode,
[00:21:50] the way that I talked about this upper limit problem
[00:21:54] is using the analogy of a thermostat.
[00:21:57] So again, briefly imagine for a moment
[00:21:59] that your success, your happiness, your income
[00:22:05] are the temperature of your thermostat,
[00:22:09] of your home, excuse me.
[00:22:10] And your internal beliefs, your self worth
[00:22:14] are the thermostat that controls it.
[00:22:17] Anytime the temperature in your home rises above
[00:22:21] where you have it set on your thermostat,
[00:22:25] the AC kicks on and cools things back off.
[00:22:28] The same occurs anytime you suddenly find yourself
[00:22:32] rising above the amount of love, success,
[00:22:36] happiness or money that you deep down believe
[00:22:38] you are deserving of.
[00:22:39] You will unconsciously begin to cool yourself off.
[00:22:44] And again, this is known as the upper limit problem.
[00:22:46] It's a psychological phenomenon that describes
[00:22:48] the unconscious experience of feeling that there's a limit
[00:22:52] to how much money, success, happiness,
[00:22:55] or love you can achieve.
[00:22:57] And this thermostat represents your internal beliefs
[00:23:01] about how much success, happiness, and wealth you deserve.
[00:23:05] And the upper limit problem sounds and looks
[00:23:12] fairly similar for a lot of people.
[00:23:14] It might sound like,
[00:23:15] oh, if I keep making this much money,
[00:23:18] I'm gonna burn out, lose my friends, lose freedom.
[00:23:21] Wait a second, I'm not the kind of person
[00:23:24] who makes 50,000 a month, six figures a month.
[00:23:28] Wait a second, if I grow too fast,
[00:23:30] I won't be able to keep up, everything will fall apart.
[00:23:33] Was this last month's just luck?
[00:23:35] I can't expect to repeat that, can I?
[00:23:37] If I get too successful, people will resent me
[00:23:40] or they'll think I've changed.
[00:23:42] Sound familiar?
[00:23:46] So as I alluded to earlier,
[00:23:49] your subconscious has one objective
[00:23:51] and that is to keep you safe.
[00:23:53] And anytime you begin to step outside of your comfort zone,
[00:23:58] you rise above that internal thermostat setting,
[00:24:01] your subconscious deploys destructive mindset programs
[00:24:06] to bring you back to safety, to cool you back off.
[00:24:11] And a destructive mindset program
[00:24:15] is an unconscious collection of emotions, beliefs,
[00:24:20] and behaviors that serve as pre-programmed reactions
[00:24:24] to particular triggers.
[00:24:28] And a destructive mindset program is designed
[00:24:30] again to keep you safe.
[00:24:32] And it does so by creating a familiar,
[00:24:36] predictable cascade of events that keep you trapped
[00:24:39] in this endless cycle of two steps forward, three steps back.
[00:24:48] Fortunately, there are countless types
[00:24:51] of destructive mindset programs
[00:24:52] and we're going to go through some examples.
[00:24:54] But every single one has the same constituent parts,
[00:25:00] a triggering situation arises.
[00:25:03] A flood of emotional energy begins to permeate
[00:25:07] into your beliefs, your self-talk, behaviors,
[00:25:12] which ultimately shapes your results
[00:25:14] and creates your identity.
[00:25:18] So we're going to take a few minutes
[00:25:19] and go through each of those constituent parts.
[00:25:22] Trigger, emotions, beliefs, word choice, behaviors.
[00:25:26] So let's be very clear here.
[00:25:29] Life demands you navigate an emotional battlefield
[00:25:32] that is rich in both scene and unseen triggers.
[00:25:37] It's not a question of if you'll encounter these triggers,
[00:25:40] but when.
[00:25:42] So a couple common triggers you might relate to include
[00:25:46] approaching a new financial milestone or level of success.
[00:25:50] Growing your team, experiencing rejection or a setback,
[00:25:55] having public visibility or the pressure to perform,
[00:25:59] hearing about one of your team members, partners,
[00:26:02] or colleagues hitting another milestone of success,
[00:26:06] experiencing an unexpected change or loss of control.
[00:26:09] These are all potentially triggering situations.
[00:26:14] And this triggering situation triggers
[00:26:17] an emotional experience.
[00:26:21] Emotions are pre-programmed, unconscious reactions
[00:26:28] to circumstances, people, or environments.
[00:26:32] They are learned energetic feeling states
[00:26:35] that become familiar as I shared with my own personal study
[00:26:38] or story, anxiety, stress, and fear related to money
[00:26:42] were learned and they became a part of what's known
[00:26:44] as my core emotional home.
[00:26:46] The emotions, I was so accustomed to experiencing
[00:26:50] that they in a weird, sick, twisted way, really,
[00:26:53] in an irrational way because that's how your subconscious is,
[00:26:56] anxiety, stress, fear felt comfortable,
[00:27:01] felt familiar, and as a result,
[00:27:04] I continue to find ways to get my fix of those emotions.
[00:27:09] Important to note about the word emotion.
[00:27:13] The Latin derivative of the word emotion
[00:27:15] is simply energy in motion.
[00:27:18] So when you feel that tightness, that tension,
[00:27:20] that heaviness, that butterfly-like sensation,
[00:27:22] it's just energy moving throughout your body.
[00:27:26] Yet, when you lack the emotional intelligence
[00:27:30] and the complimentary tools to process
[00:27:32] and express this energy, this emotion,
[00:27:36] it becomes trapped.
[00:27:38] And as Sigmund Freud said,
[00:27:41] unexpressed or trapped emotions will never die.
[00:27:45] They are buried alive and will come forth later
[00:27:48] in uglier ways.
[00:27:50] It's like a pressure valve.
[00:27:52] Inevitably, it will burst if that pressure does not reduce.
[00:27:56] And I'm a walking testimonial.
[00:27:57] My marriage imploded because I was unable to break free
[00:28:01] from these patterns.
[00:28:03] That was that pressure valve moment.
[00:28:06] So what are some of the destructive emotional experiences?
[00:28:08] Again, emotion on its own is not destructive,
[00:28:10] unless you invite in that emotion
[00:28:13] to take the steering wheel of your life
[00:28:15] and to be in charge of all of the decisions and actions.
[00:28:19] But some of the potential destructive emotions
[00:28:21] can include fear, frustration, anger, anxiety,
[00:28:26] disappointment, shame, regret, doubt, impatience,
[00:28:29] and even overconfidence.
[00:28:31] And all of these emotions may be experienced
[00:28:33] quite differently depending on the individual,
[00:28:36] but you might experience one or more of those emotions
[00:28:40] as tightness in your body, tension, knots, butterflies,
[00:28:44] pins and needles, warmth, the heat, a heaviness,
[00:28:46] a stiffness, a rigidity.
[00:28:49] So we know triggering situation arise,
[00:28:52] an emotion is triggered, that emotion then begins
[00:28:54] to affect our beliefs.
[00:28:56] Or what beliefs begin to then serve as the filter
[00:29:01] through which we make decisions and take actions.
[00:29:04] So I like to talk about beliefs as the lens
[00:29:07] through which you see the world.
[00:29:09] They help to facilitate predictability
[00:29:12] and safety in your life.
[00:29:14] And they serve as a filter for your decisions and actions.
[00:29:18] Every single one of us has four core beliefs.
[00:29:22] We have a belief about ourself,
[00:29:24] others, life and money.
[00:29:29] And this is probably a podcast conversation all
[00:29:32] and it's on its own for a future one,
[00:29:34] but I wanna talk briefly about this.
[00:29:36] You have three core beliefs about yourself.
[00:29:39] What you're worthy, what you're deserving
[00:29:41] and what you're capable of.
[00:29:43] You will never, ever, ever rise above that.
[00:29:47] Period.
[00:29:48] You can talk about how much you wanna earn millions
[00:29:50] of dollars every year, but if deep down,
[00:29:52] you don't believe you're worth more than 500,000 a year.
[00:29:54] You will never make more than that.
[00:29:56] Period.
[00:29:58] Your life experiences also dictate whether or not you trust others
[00:30:03] and whether or not it's safe to see the best in others,
[00:30:07] whether you view life as fair or unfair
[00:30:11] and whether there's always or never enough money.
[00:30:17] What makes this situation about your belief system interesting
[00:30:20] and can make it feel as if it's an uphill, never-ending battle
[00:30:25] is that researchers estimate 95% of your belief system
[00:30:28] is formed before the age of seven.
[00:30:32] So the current set of beliefs you possess
[00:30:36] may not be yours.
[00:30:38] Yet, you're the only person who can do something about that.
[00:30:43] So common limiting beliefs that might resonate.
[00:30:46] I'm not cut out to be a top producer.
[00:30:49] I don't deserve to make that much money.
[00:30:52] I need to struggle to prove that I've earned it.
[00:30:57] It's too much competition.
[00:30:59] I'll never stand out.
[00:31:00] The market's saturated.
[00:31:03] I'm not good at sales.
[00:31:05] I'm not a natural closer.
[00:31:07] I'm not tech savvy enough to keep up.
[00:31:11] Success means sacrificing time with family and peace of mind.
[00:31:15] Any of those sound familiar?
[00:31:17] They hit you in the fields.
[00:31:18] You noticing some of that emotional energy
[00:31:20] swirling throughout your body?
[00:31:23] So I use that specific analogy.
[00:31:26] A belief is like a filter, a lens through which you begin
[00:31:29] to make decisions and take action.
[00:31:31] Your belief has a direct impact on the words you use
[00:31:34] to speak to and about yourself.
[00:31:37] And I want you to listen closely when I talk about this.
[00:31:41] There's an inherent energy, a magic, if you will,
[00:31:45] in your word choice.
[00:31:47] And I'm not trying to get all hairy potter on you.
[00:31:49] But I need you to hear me when I say,
[00:31:51] it's not a coincidence that the construction of words
[00:31:55] is referred to as spell-ing.
[00:31:59] You see what I'm saying?
[00:32:01] Words have the power, the potential, the magic,
[00:32:04] to cast a spell on your energy, actions,
[00:32:07] results, identity, and reality.
[00:32:09] And words are the individual building blocks
[00:32:11] of your mental sentences, which, really,
[00:32:14] is just another way to say your thoughts.
[00:32:16] So interestingly enough, it's estimated you have
[00:32:19] between 50 and 70,000 thoughts per day.
[00:32:24] Roughly 80 to 90% are negative,
[00:32:26] and roughly 80 to 90% are the same as yesterday.
[00:32:32] Fortunately, you have the free will and the power
[00:32:36] to choose which thoughts you hold onto
[00:32:38] and give more time, energy, and attention.
[00:32:42] So as we continue downstream, there's a trigger,
[00:32:45] an emotion, it basically dictates what lens
[00:32:48] or belief is gonna come up.
[00:32:50] That belief then influences the words we used,
[00:32:53] our thoughts, which then dictate the actions we take.
[00:32:57] And when I'm talking about actions, specifically behaviors,
[00:33:00] I'm addressing self-sabotage behaviors.
[00:33:04] Again, these are destructive mindset programs after all.
[00:33:08] So there's an element of sabotage, of course.
[00:33:10] So I like to talk about sabotaging behaviors
[00:33:12] by breaking them down into two categories.
[00:33:16] Capital S and lowercase S sabotaging behaviors.
[00:33:22] Capital S sabotaging behaviors are the obvious behaviors
[00:33:25] you're aware of that are sabotaging your success.
[00:33:29] Though the behavior is that if anybody were to see here
[00:33:31] or read about what instantly say, oh, no shit,
[00:33:34] of course you're sabotaging yourself.
[00:33:37] So this could include drinking excessively
[00:33:40] to unwind or celebrate, avoiding follow-up calls
[00:33:43] or client conversations, with drawing after a deal falls
[00:33:47] through or a client backs out, binge watching
[00:33:50] or scrolling social media during work hours,
[00:33:53] skipping coaching calls, ignoring advice,
[00:33:56] neglecting financial awareness and management,
[00:33:59] or turning to food, gambling, or overspending
[00:34:01] to cope with emotional stress.
[00:34:07] Lowercase S sabotaging behaviors on the other hand
[00:34:12] are the not so obvious, often overlooked behaviors
[00:34:16] you're unaware of.
[00:34:17] On their own, eh, seems like no big deal.
[00:34:21] It's a one off, eh, not that bad.
[00:34:24] These are quiet, sneaky forms of self-sabotage
[00:34:27] that seem harmless in the moment,
[00:34:29] but they erode performance, confidence,
[00:34:33] and momentum over time.
[00:34:36] Examples include hitting the snooze button
[00:34:38] and starting your day in reaction mode,
[00:34:41] skipping morning routines, meditation, or planning,
[00:34:44] not posting or promoting yourself consistently
[00:34:46] because of not feeling ready,
[00:34:48] or my dad thinking you're good enough.
[00:34:51] Downplaying wins, procrastinating on uncomfortable tasks,
[00:34:55] comparing yourself to others,
[00:34:57] avoiding CRM cleanup or following up with lukewarm leads.
[00:35:04] Any of those sound familiar?
[00:35:06] Capitalists, lowercase S sabotage?
[00:35:11] So let's put it all together now.
[00:35:13] Again, the constituent parts of a destructive mindset program
[00:35:16] include a trigger and emotion of belief, words, action,
[00:35:20] and a result.
[00:35:21] These programs are deployed by your subconscious mind
[00:35:24] to keep you safe, to keep you stuck
[00:35:26] in the pattern of familiarity, predictability, and certainty.
[00:35:30] So I want to run you through a couple of these
[00:35:33] that are incredibly prominent,
[00:35:34] that I have a hunch are probably quite relatable.
[00:35:38] So this first program, also known as fear of success,
[00:35:42] the trigger is you suddenly realize
[00:35:44] you're on track for your highest grossing month or year ever.
[00:35:47] And suddenly that trigger is fear, doubt, anxiety.
[00:35:52] The belief is I'm not ready for this much growth.
[00:35:55] I'm not deserving.
[00:35:57] And that spirals into what if I can't keep this up?
[00:35:59] I don't want this pressure.
[00:36:01] Am I an imposter?
[00:36:01] Do I deserve this?
[00:36:03] And this leads into delaying follow-up
[00:36:05] avoiding closing leads, making careless mistakes.
[00:36:08] And then you fall short and justify
[00:36:11] these subpar results as circumstantial.
[00:36:17] Another one, fear of rejection.
[00:36:19] It's time to follow up with the past leader
[00:36:21] to ask for a referral, triggers anxiety, dread, discomfort.
[00:36:26] And the belief is, well, if they say no, it means I failed.
[00:36:29] They don't like me.
[00:36:30] I'm not good enough.
[00:36:31] So you start to craft these sneaky excuses and justifications.
[00:36:34] And they probably forget about me.
[00:36:36] Or I don't want to be annoying.
[00:36:39] And the action is you avoid outreach or you delay contact.
[00:36:42] And then ultimately you lose the opportunity
[00:36:44] and you diminish your pipeline.
[00:36:48] Imposter syndrome.
[00:36:50] Let's say for example, you land a high-end listing
[00:36:53] or close a major loan.
[00:36:55] Immediately you feel insecure.
[00:36:59] Fearful, uneasy.
[00:37:00] Suddenly you believe I'm not qualified to be here.
[00:37:02] Oh, I don't deserve this.
[00:37:04] And you start talking to yourself
[00:37:05] and it sounds like, ooh, I'm gonna be found out.
[00:37:08] They're gonna realize I don't actually know what I'm doing.
[00:37:10] I'm not qualified.
[00:37:11] I don't have enough experience, the right experience.
[00:37:14] So you over-explain yourself.
[00:37:16] You second-guess your decisions.
[00:37:17] You pull back underperform and miss opportunities.
[00:37:25] One of my personal programs I had to work so hard to overcome
[00:37:29] was the relationship between money and success.
[00:37:32] Suddenly let's say for example a commission check clears
[00:37:34] or a big month is on the horizon.
[00:37:38] Your tense, you're fearful.
[00:37:39] You feel overwhelmed.
[00:37:41] Money always comes with pressures
[00:37:42] the belief you're operating from.
[00:37:44] More deals means more fires to put out.
[00:37:47] More people to impress.
[00:37:48] More conversations.
[00:37:49] And suddenly you begin to unconsciously slow down.
[00:37:52] Cool things down or over-complicate deals.
[00:37:55] And your momentum suddenly flatlines after a big win.
[00:38:00] Let's do one more.
[00:38:03] Let's say you have this inherent need to be liked to fit in.
[00:38:07] It's called being human.
[00:38:09] It's just more prominent and stronger
[00:38:11] and some of us compared to others.
[00:38:14] In an example situation, imagine for a moment
[00:38:17] you're ready to assert higher standards.
[00:38:19] Raise your rates or to niche down.
[00:38:21] Go after your new target market.
[00:38:23] But you feel sense of insecurity.
[00:38:25] The fear of disconnection and guilt.
[00:38:27] Maybe you're contemplating leaving your team
[00:38:30] and going off on your own.
[00:38:32] But you start to tell yourself,
[00:38:34] well, if I make bold moves,
[00:38:37] people will think I'm arrogant.
[00:38:39] I don't want to make other people feel uncomfortable.
[00:38:42] And suddenly you're so far more concerned with other people
[00:38:46] than your original goal and the fire you once had
[00:38:48] to go off on your own to take this bold action.
[00:38:50] You start to undercharge, over deliver, avoid boundaries.
[00:38:55] And you play small.
[00:38:56] You din your light.
[00:38:57] And you're stuck with feelings of burnout, resentment.
[00:39:00] And a lot less money than you possibly could have had
[00:39:03] in your bank account.
[00:39:05] So it's my hope that some of those resonated with you
[00:39:08] because the exciting news after what probably felt like
[00:39:13] a bit of a grim conversation thus far
[00:39:14] is that these destructive mindset programs are learn.
[00:39:19] Which means they can be unlearned.
[00:39:25] And one of the most practical first lines of action
[00:39:30] you can take after you're having this profound awareness
[00:39:34] is just starting to get curious,
[00:39:37] getting incredibly curious about what your destructive mindset
[00:39:41] programs are, the patterns of thinking, feeling,
[00:39:44] believing and behaving, how are they holding back you back?
[00:39:47] How are they making you feel?
[00:39:49] What are they protecting you from?
[00:39:51] How are they helping you?
[00:39:53] They are helping you.
[00:39:54] They're keeping you safe, protecting you from something.
[00:39:58] And once you get some clarity around this,
[00:40:00] start to break down your destructive mindset program.
[00:40:04] Identify the sabotaging behaviors that promote safety.
[00:40:07] Identify the negative harsh overly critical self-talk.
[00:40:11] Identify the beliefs you have about yourself, others, life,
[00:40:16] real estate and money, and start poking holes in these beliefs.
[00:40:21] Start practicing emotional awareness
[00:40:24] and emotional resiliency practices,
[00:40:26] meditation, journaling, breathwork,
[00:40:28] having a strong consistent fitness regimen,
[00:40:32] developing a meditation practice.
[00:40:35] And this is a wonderful starting point.
[00:40:38] And of course, I'm biased.
[00:40:40] I'm a big believer that asking for help accelerates results.

Welcome back. This is the third installment of the inner game of real estate success. And I'm thrilled that you're tuning in. And today's conversation will serve as a phenomenal stand alone. But I need to encourage you to get the most out of today's conversation, to go back and listen to the episode published on June 26th. Because that is a conversation that deep dives into the topic known as the upper limit problem or also known as fear of success. That conversation is going to provide you with an incredible framework and foundation to get every single nugget and ounce of value out of today's conversation. And the way I'd like to begin today's conversation is with the story. And I want you to begin to imagine for a moment and really just begin to listen to see what elements, what characteristics, what aspects of this story resonate with you. The story's about a client of mine. A client of mine is the oldest of four. And he is the oldest of four. Two parents, one of which came from immigrant parents. Her parents, his mother, his mother's parents came over when they were seven or eight years old from Eastern Europe. And her entire upbringing, there was always enough money to go around to take care of her needs as well as her two sisters needs. Yet dad was always working, always working. Dad, on the other hand, this client's dad, was one of eight. And as you can imagine, his mother, my client's grandmother, became a brilliant mind at mastering the skill of pinching pennies. One of the most creative ways she indulged her mind each week was finding an opportunity to see how long and how far she could stretch to an acasceral until her husband's paycheck came in and she could buy another round of groceries that would hopefully last the week to feed all eight children. My point is this, my client's parents always had their needs met yet money was tight. Both of their respective fathers had a tenacious work ethic, always, always working. And this is especially true in his dad's side because his mother was a nurse for a couple of years and into his upbringing, but eventually had to leave that job to stay at home full time to, as you can imagine, raise eight kids. Well, we fast forward when my client's parents met fell in love, got married, the whole shebang happily ever after, which hey, they've been married, who, 35 plus years if I recall correctly, and that's incredible. Dad took a job. All he had known since early high school and tools early 20s was construction, building houses, fixing things, and understanding that that was not a viable option, a sustainable option for the future him and his wife wanted. He took a sales job, a 100% commission-based sales job. And for the next 30 years, he worked at, excelled at that job. It remained 100% commission-based, all 30 years, where he ultimately went on to raise four wonderful children, including my client, the oldest of those four. And in my client's words, reflecting back, his needs were met, a good majority of his wants were met and satisfied. Yet there was always an undercurrent of scarcity and anxiety around money. There were many moments he recalled in which his parents said yes when he asked for things he wanted, but equally if not more moments in which they said no. And there were a couple particular moments in hindsight, specifically the .com burst of 2000, the housing market crash and recession of 0708 into 09ish, in which upon reflection my client looks back and he could just feel the palpable tension, lacks scarcity, anxiety, fear related to money or lack thereof. There were countless years of his upbringing when his dad was up at 4am, home at 6pm, and a couple times a week might have went back into the office to work and get shit done. And one of his dad's mantras was always, I'll sleep when I'm dead, phenomenal work ethic, ambitious, tenacious, committed, relentless. The picture I'm attempting to paint for you is that there was a generational pattern of scarcity lack around money. The only known solution being if I want to earn more, I have to work more. This client's father watched his father relentlessly work to feed eight mouths. My client's father embodied that tirelessly worked in the pursuit of being able to provide his four children and to create a wonderful life. As you can imagine, the generational characteristics and relationship with money were passed down to my client. And my client, fortunately or unfortunately, was bitten by the entrepreneurial bug quite young. He was mowing yards, selling things on the sidewalk from a very young age, had his own lawn care company business throughout high school. God, into the personal training round became a personal trainer, a group fitness instructor, ultimately a coach, and then has been in the coaching, consulting and speaking industry for a very long time. When he officially left his clasped corporate stop to go all in on his side hustle, for five years in a row, he made the exact same amount of money. For five consecutive years in a row, the number of hours he averaged per week of work went from 40-ish to 50-ish to 60, 65, 70 hours per week on average at his peak. Throughout this five year process, he pivoted multiple times in terms of who his ideal demographic target audience in niche work. He read the books he took, the courses he attended, the events, he invested handsomely in multiple so-called business coaches and gurus. He wrote books, he built online courses, he created communities, he kept doing more and more and more in hopes that his income would finally break through some arbitrary ceiling or threshold, and he'd finally feel that elusive sense of peace, happiness and contentment. He operated with the belief that the harder I worked, the more I worked, the more I will make, the more happiness and peace I will feel the less anxiety, tension and fear I will experience. But as I shared again, five consecutive years, the only thing that increased was the amount of stress, anxiety and number of hours he worked, as well as the exhaustion, the things that decrease were the amounts of sleep, the quality of his marriage, the quality of his well-being, the quality of his relationship with money, friends and family. And oh, by the way, the income more or less never moved for five consecutive years plus or minus the same $10,000 at the end of the year. And it really begged the question, why was he doing all of this? What was the cost? Was it worth it? My client had taken the same pattern of emotions, stress and anxiety. My client had taken the same learned beliefs. I need to work more to earn more. Then I'll be happy that had been passed down from generation to generation. And he replicated that. Almost to a T for five consecutive years, his entrepreneurship journey again marked by a plateau and income with increasing levels of stress, fear, anxiety, poor self-care, poor relationships, his marriage ultimately crumbling and ending in divorce. And all of this, A, learned, passed on generationally, but B, all of this forming what I now refer to as the origin of destructive mindset programs, these patterns of thinking, feeling, believing and behaving that are deployed by our subconscious mind, designed to keep us safe. Remember, your subconscious has one primary goal to keep you safe. The way that it keeps you safe is keeping you stuck in patterns and experiences of familiarity, predictability and certainty. So you might be wondering, how, for my client, did remaining stuck at that particular income threshold for five years, keep him safe? How did it benefit him? Well, here's where we bring in another layer of complexity. Given as human beings, our subconscious has one primary objective. Again, to keep us safe, that means as a result, all of us human beings have three core fears, fear of judgment, abandonment and rejection. And that's because centuries ago, if you were judged, rejected and ultimately abandoned by your tribe, you either starve to death, or you were eaten by a saber-toothed tiger. And although the literal threat of judgment, rejection, abandonment isn't an actual threat to our well-being, life or death, in maybe 99.9% of circumstances, today, the visceral fear experience is as real and prominent as palpable as ever before. So here's where things get interesting. My client, as I mentioned, had been bitten by the entrepreneur bug from a very young age. He had all these grand aspirations to make a ton of money, his set site on crossing that seven figure per year threshold. He's doing all the things, he's writing books, creating courses, hiring coaches, paid advertising, social media, you name it, he probably tried it in some way, shape or form. He's got these big aspirations, but it felt like he kept running into an invisible wall, a glass ceiling, as if this invisible gravitational-like force was creating a form of resistance, holding him back, because there was an underlying belief that it wasn't safe to scale his income to the next level. And this could be an entire conversation in of itself, but the key point I want to get to is that safety or that lack thereof was rooted in a fear of judgment, rejection and abandonment from his parents, specifically from his father. My client observed for three decades, his father worked his ass off 12, 14, 16, even 18 hour days all to provide for his siblings, his mom, that family, all to provide what my client ultimately described as a wonderful childhood and upbringing with opportunities. How dare my client reach a point where he earns more money than his dad? That's so disrespectful. How dare my client go work for himself, doing something he loves, not that his dad didn't love what he did. But then in a significantly shorter amount of time, start making significantly more money. How dare he? There was such an existential threat to creating tension, resentment, rejection, judgment and abandonment between my client and the relationship he had with his dad that he found himself stuck in a pattern of sneaky quiet self conscious self sabotage until he did the work necessary to dismantle that pattern. Now here's where things become eerie. My client told me. That the income amount he made and was stuck out for those five years was almost identical to the cumulative income his dad and mom made each year. He still is a vivid memory of seeing the amount of money his dad made when filling out a fast-follow form for college aid when he was preparing to go off to college. And he could roughly estimate based on his mom's industry what she earned in a given year. And if you add those numbers together, that is where my client remains stuck for those five consecutive years. And it wasn't until he identified this collection of destructive mindset programs that you're gonna become privy to and have a much deeper understanding of by the end of today's conversation that alongside his own mindset and performance coach, he was able to break the cycle, dismantle the patterns soar above that threshold while simultaneously working less and experiencing significantly more piece, fulfillment, presence, joy, contentment, and exponentially increasing the quality of his life. And you may wonder, how do I have such an intimate knowing and understanding of this experience? Because the client I described as myself, that was my story. For five years held back by the weight of outdated beliefs and behaviors, emotional reactions that weren't even mine, but they were all I knew. Feeling as if I was running into a brick wall, banging my head against the wall year after year for five consecutive years wondering what? The fuck. Do I need to do to ever change my results? And as I alluded to it, wasn't until I hired my own mindset coach, I was able to see this more clearly than ever before and then do the work, take the action necessary to break free. And that's what we're gonna learn more about in today's conversation. So if you're still with me, buckle up because you're in for a journey, you're in for 15 to 18 more minutes, of probably feeling like you're gonna be drinking through a garden hose. That's okay because you can go back and relisten to this. And what I really wanna do is tie in a little bit of the key points from last episode, all about the upper limit problem, use that as a springboard to talk about destructive mindset programs. And I'll do that by beginning with a few simple questions. You the listener, do you know, do you feel do you believe that you're capable of selling and earning more? Do you know what to do to sell, scale and earn more? Yeah, I thought so. And if you truly don't, you can quickly fill those knowledge gaps from another episode on this podcast, Google, or all of our beloved best friends, chat GPT. But the point is this, you don't have a lack of information problem. You have a mindset problem. And if you recall from last episode, the way that I talked about this upper limit problem is using the analogy of a thermostat. So again, briefly imagine for a moment that your success, your happiness, your income are the temperature of your thermostat, of your home, excuse me. And your internal beliefs, your self worth are the thermostat that controls it. Anytime the temperature in your home rises above where you have it set on your thermostat, the AC kicks on and cools things back off. The same occurs anytime you suddenly find yourself rising above the amount of love, success, happiness or money that you deep down believe you are deserving of. You will unconsciously begin to cool yourself off. And again, this is known as the upper limit problem. It's a psychological phenomenon that describes the unconscious experience of feeling that there's a limit to how much money, success, happiness, or love you can achieve. And this thermostat represents your internal beliefs about how much success, happiness, and wealth you deserve. And the upper limit problem sounds and looks fairly similar for a lot of people. It might sound like, oh, if I keep making this much money, I'm gonna burn out, lose my friends, lose freedom. Wait a second, I'm not the kind of person who makes 50,000 a month, six figures a month. Wait a second, if I grow too fast, I won't be able to keep up, everything will fall apart. Was this last month's just luck? I can't expect to repeat that, can I? If I get too successful, people will resent me or they'll think I've changed. Sound familiar? So as I alluded to earlier, your subconscious has one objective and that is to keep you safe. And anytime you begin to step outside of your comfort zone, you rise above that internal thermostat setting, your subconscious deploys destructive mindset programs to bring you back to safety, to cool you back off. And a destructive mindset program is an unconscious collection of emotions, beliefs, and behaviors that serve as pre-programmed reactions to particular triggers. And a destructive mindset program is designed again to keep you safe. And it does so by creating a familiar, predictable cascade of events that keep you trapped in this endless cycle of two steps forward, three steps back. Fortunately, there are countless types of destructive mindset programs and we're going to go through some examples. But every single one has the same constituent parts, a triggering situation arises. A flood of emotional energy begins to permeate into your beliefs, your self-talk, behaviors, which ultimately shapes your results and creates your identity. So we're going to take a few minutes and go through each of those constituent parts. Trigger, emotions, beliefs, word choice, behaviors. So let's be very clear here. Life demands you navigate an emotional battlefield that is rich in both scene and unseen triggers. It's not a question of if you'll encounter these triggers, but when. So a couple common triggers you might relate to include approaching a new financial milestone or level of success. Growing your team, experiencing rejection or a setback, having public visibility or the pressure to perform, hearing about one of your team members, partners, or colleagues hitting another milestone of success, experiencing an unexpected change or loss of control. These are all potentially triggering situations. And this triggering situation triggers an emotional experience. Emotions are pre-programmed, unconscious reactions to circumstances, people, or environments. They are learned energetic feeling states that become familiar as I shared with my own personal study or story, anxiety, stress, and fear related to money were learned and they became a part of what's known as my core emotional home. The emotions, I was so accustomed to experiencing that they in a weird, sick, twisted way, really, in an irrational way because that's how your subconscious is, anxiety, stress, fear felt comfortable, felt familiar, and as a result, I continue to find ways to get my fix of those emotions. Important to note about the word emotion. The Latin derivative of the word emotion is simply energy in motion. So when you feel that tightness, that tension, that heaviness, that butterfly-like sensation, it's just energy moving throughout your body. Yet, when you lack the emotional intelligence and the complimentary tools to process and express this energy, this emotion, it becomes trapped. And as Sigmund Freud said, unexpressed or trapped emotions will never die. They are buried alive and will come forth later in uglier ways. It's like a pressure valve. Inevitably, it will burst if that pressure does not reduce. And I'm a walking testimonial. My marriage imploded because I was unable to break free from these patterns. That was that pressure valve moment. So what are some of the destructive emotional experiences? Again, emotion on its own is not destructive, unless you invite in that emotion to take the steering wheel of your life and to be in charge of all of the decisions and actions. But some of the potential destructive emotions can include fear, frustration, anger, anxiety, disappointment, shame, regret, doubt, impatience, and even overconfidence. And all of these emotions may be experienced quite differently depending on the individual, but you might experience one or more of those emotions as tightness in your body, tension, knots, butterflies, pins and needles, warmth, the heat, a heaviness, a stiffness, a rigidity. So we know triggering situation arise, an emotion is triggered, that emotion then begins to affect our beliefs. Or what beliefs begin to then serve as the filter through which we make decisions and take actions. So I like to talk about beliefs as the lens through which you see the world. They help to facilitate predictability and safety in your life. And they serve as a filter for your decisions and actions. Every single one of us has four core beliefs. We have a belief about ourself, others, life and money. And this is probably a podcast conversation all and it's on its own for a future one, but I wanna talk briefly about this. You have three core beliefs about yourself. What you're worthy, what you're deserving and what you're capable of. You will never, ever, ever rise above that. Period. You can talk about how much you wanna earn millions of dollars every year, but if deep down, you don't believe you're worth more than 500,000 a year. You will never make more than that. Period. Your life experiences also dictate whether or not you trust others and whether or not it's safe to see the best in others, whether you view life as fair or unfair and whether there's always or never enough money. What makes this situation about your belief system interesting and can make it feel as if it's an uphill, never-ending battle is that researchers estimate 95% of your belief system is formed before the age of seven. So the current set of beliefs you possess may not be yours. Yet, you're the only person who can do something about that. So common limiting beliefs that might resonate. I'm not cut out to be a top producer. I don't deserve to make that much money. I need to struggle to prove that I've earned it. It's too much competition. I'll never stand out. The market's saturated. I'm not good at sales. I'm not a natural closer. I'm not tech savvy enough to keep up. Success means sacrificing time with family and peace of mind. Any of those sound familiar? They hit you in the fields. You noticing some of that emotional energy swirling throughout your body? So I use that specific analogy. A belief is like a filter, a lens through which you begin to make decisions and take action. Your belief has a direct impact on the words you use to speak to and about yourself. And I want you to listen closely when I talk about this. There's an inherent energy, a magic, if you will, in your word choice. And I'm not trying to get all hairy potter on you. But I need you to hear me when I say, it's not a coincidence that the construction of words is referred to as spell-ing. You see what I'm saying? Words have the power, the potential, the magic, to cast a spell on your energy, actions, results, identity, and reality. And words are the individual building blocks of your mental sentences, which, really, is just another way to say your thoughts. So interestingly enough, it's estimated you have between 50 and 70,000 thoughts per day. Roughly 80 to 90% are negative, and roughly 80 to 90% are the same as yesterday. Fortunately, you have the free will and the power to choose which thoughts you hold onto and give more time, energy, and attention. So as we continue downstream, there's a trigger, an emotion, it basically dictates what lens or belief is gonna come up. That belief then influences the words we used, our thoughts, which then dictate the actions we take. And when I'm talking about actions, specifically behaviors, I'm addressing self-sabotage behaviors. Again, these are destructive mindset programs after all. So there's an element of sabotage, of course. So I like to talk about sabotaging behaviors by breaking them down into two categories. Capital S and lowercase S sabotaging behaviors. Capital S sabotaging behaviors are the obvious behaviors you're aware of that are sabotaging your success. Though the behavior is that if anybody were to see here or read about what instantly say, oh, no shit, of course you're sabotaging yourself. So this could include drinking excessively to unwind or celebrate, avoiding follow-up calls or client conversations, with drawing after a deal falls through or a client backs out, binge watching or scrolling social media during work hours, skipping coaching calls, ignoring advice, neglecting financial awareness and management, or turning to food, gambling, or overspending to cope with emotional stress. Lowercase S sabotaging behaviors on the other hand are the not so obvious, often overlooked behaviors you're unaware of. On their own, eh, seems like no big deal. It's a one off, eh, not that bad. These are quiet, sneaky forms of self-sabotage that seem harmless in the moment, but they erode performance, confidence, and momentum over time. Examples include hitting the snooze button and starting your day in reaction mode, skipping morning routines, meditation, or planning, not posting or promoting yourself consistently because of not feeling ready, or my dad thinking you're good enough. Downplaying wins, procrastinating on uncomfortable tasks, comparing yourself to others, avoiding CRM cleanup or following up with lukewarm leads. Any of those sound familiar? Capitalists, lowercase S sabotage? So let's put it all together now. Again, the constituent parts of a destructive mindset program include a trigger and emotion of belief, words, action, and a result. These programs are deployed by your subconscious mind to keep you safe, to keep you stuck in the pattern of familiarity, predictability, and certainty. So I want to run you through a couple of these that are incredibly prominent, that I have a hunch are probably quite relatable. So this first program, also known as fear of success, the trigger is you suddenly realize you're on track for your highest grossing month or year ever. And suddenly that trigger is fear, doubt, anxiety. The belief is I'm not ready for this much growth. I'm not deserving. And that spirals into what if I can't keep this up? I don't want this pressure. Am I an imposter? Do I deserve this? And this leads into delaying follow-up avoiding closing leads, making careless mistakes. And then you fall short and justify these subpar results as circumstantial. Another one, fear of rejection. It's time to follow up with the past leader to ask for a referral, triggers anxiety, dread, discomfort. And the belief is, well, if they say no, it means I failed. They don't like me. I'm not good enough. So you start to craft these sneaky excuses and justifications. And they probably forget about me. Or I don't want to be annoying. And the action is you avoid outreach or you delay contact. And then ultimately you lose the opportunity and you diminish your pipeline. Imposter syndrome. Let's say for example, you land a high-end listing or close a major loan. Immediately you feel insecure. Fearful, uneasy. Suddenly you believe I'm not qualified to be here. Oh, I don't deserve this. And you start talking to yourself and it sounds like, ooh, I'm gonna be found out. They're gonna realize I don't actually know what I'm doing. I'm not qualified. I don't have enough experience, the right experience. So you over-explain yourself. You second-guess your decisions. You pull back underperform and miss opportunities. One of my personal programs I had to work so hard to overcome was the relationship between money and success. Suddenly let's say for example a commission check clears or a big month is on the horizon. Your tense, you're fearful. You feel overwhelmed. Money always comes with pressures the belief you're operating from. More deals means more fires to put out. More people to impress. More conversations. And suddenly you begin to unconsciously slow down. Cool things down or over-complicate deals. And your momentum suddenly flatlines after a big win. Let's do one more. Let's say you have this inherent need to be liked to fit in. It's called being human. It's just more prominent and stronger and some of us compared to others. In an example situation, imagine for a moment you're ready to assert higher standards. Raise your rates or to niche down. Go after your new target market. But you feel sense of insecurity. The fear of disconnection and guilt. Maybe you're contemplating leaving your team and going off on your own. But you start to tell yourself, well, if I make bold moves, people will think I'm arrogant. I don't want to make other people feel uncomfortable. And suddenly you're so far more concerned with other people than your original goal and the fire you once had to go off on your own to take this bold action. You start to undercharge, over deliver, avoid boundaries. And you play small. You din your light. And you're stuck with feelings of burnout, resentment. And a lot less money than you possibly could have had in your bank account. So it's my hope that some of those resonated with you because the exciting news after what probably felt like a bit of a grim conversation thus far is that these destructive mindset programs are learn. Which means they can be unlearned. And one of the most practical first lines of action you can take after you're having this profound awareness is just starting to get curious, getting incredibly curious about what your destructive mindset programs are, the patterns of thinking, feeling, believing and behaving, how are they holding back you back? How are they making you feel? What are they protecting you from? How are they helping you? They are helping you. They're keeping you safe, protecting you from something. And once you get some clarity around this, start to break down your destructive mindset program. Identify the sabotaging behaviors that promote safety. Identify the negative harsh overly critical self-talk. Identify the beliefs you have about yourself, others, life, real estate and money, and start poking holes in these beliefs. Start practicing emotional awareness and emotional resiliency practices, meditation, journaling, breathwork, having a strong consistent fitness regimen, developing a meditation practice. And this is a wonderful starting point. And of course, I'm biased. I'm a big believer that asking for help accelerates results. Asking for help alleviates anxiety. Action alleviates anxiety.

And as we wrap up this conversation, I want to first again, thank you for tuning in the last Thursday of every single month, the inner game of real estate. This is the content nobody is talking about. This is the content between your ears you need to address, confront, take ownership of. This is where the separation resides. Everybody can get their hands on the education. Everybody can cold call. Everybody can learn how to sell to an extent. But if you're not taking command and ownership of what's taking place in your inner experience between your ears, you're missing an invaluable opportunity to smash the competition, rise above, and achieve all of your goals and dreams. And I want that for you. I want that for you. If you found today's episode helpful, share it with a fellow real estate agent broker, lender, entrepreneur or friend who needs to understand how they are continuing to sabotage themselves, and also understand there is hope to unlearn those patterns to become the best version of themselves. Thank you again for tuning in to the inner game of real estate success. Again, if this episode shifted your mindset, gave you a new perspective, share it.
