[00:01:48] Welcome back to the May series on checklist specifically for buyers again
[00:01:55] This is Ali Garcet or Ali the agent on all social media and I'm looking forward to part two of the buyer series
[00:02:03] If you remember from last time I went over part one of the buyer series when I where I went over email one which really is
[00:02:12] Part of my calendar now. That's where I have my buyer intake and
[00:02:17] I also went over buyer email number two, which is where I send the clients once we decide that we're
[00:02:22] Working together that were committed to each other that I send them the email with all of the attachments
[00:02:30] So that way they're educated on all of the steps and they get the contract everything like that
[00:02:36] So what today's episode is going to be on is
[00:02:41] That middle portion so pretty much like contract to almost close
[00:02:46] We're gonna cover buyer email three and buyer email number four and of course the Trello checklist that I use for every single buyer
[00:02:55] Every single seller every single referral every single agent that joins the crew the onboarding checklist. I won't be covering that but
[00:03:01] So if you want to follow along
[00:03:04] I
[00:03:05] Suggest watching this again on YouTube
[00:03:07] I also in case you can't watch this on YouTube right now. I do suggest
[00:03:13] That you watch this on YouTube as well later on after you listen to this episode
[00:03:19] That will probably give you the biggest the best idea of how I you can visualize it better, you know
[00:03:26] And also if you're interested in these checklist shoot me a text my phone number is 520
[00:03:34] 341 2552 text the word checklist and
[00:03:38] We'll set up a call and then after that you can receive these checklist. I'm here to to give it out no cost
[00:03:44] So also if you're looking to one day grow a team or increase your team if you're already a broker owner
[00:03:52] This is a great way for you to leverage and give
[00:03:57] You know front to end checklist for how to work with sellers how to work with buyers how to work with investors
[00:04:04] Referrals that you can give to the agents on your team or you can use as leverage for those agents to
[00:04:10] To do the work and then know
[00:04:13] Exactly what step they're on what is next so that way nothing is left because there's nothing worse than
[00:04:21] Waking up in the middle of the night and I know that every REALTOR has been there where they're like oh my gosh
[00:04:26] I forgot to send the due diligence report. You know whatever it is
[00:04:29] It there's you can you can avoid feeling like that and you can help your team avoid feeling like that when everyone has a checklist of
[00:04:39] Knowing exactly what they have done what they have checked off what they have not yet. So
[00:04:43] again
[00:04:45] My phone number is 520 341 2552
[00:04:49] Text the word checklist or if you're interested in using this to grow your team
[00:04:54] Message me but anyway, so here is part two
[00:04:58] I'm gonna vocalize as much as I can for those that are not watching this on YouTube
[00:05:03] I do suggest if you find any of this helpful please
[00:05:07] Give DJ give keeping it real a five star review or
[00:05:12] Follow them on YouTube comment
[00:05:15] Anything anything would help and I really want to give back to DJ so
[00:05:20] For having such a great podcast so over here. I'm sharing my trello
[00:05:26] Screen again and again trello for those I have not used it is a free project management tool free
[00:05:36] Where you can create cards or boards and you can list out every single item on a checklist and you can
[00:05:44] You share this as you can see I I share it with my crew and they can copy and paste it
[00:05:50] So in that and move it into their own board again leverage
[00:05:53] So you create the template and they can just copy and paste it and include their own address
[00:05:58] And then yeah, so let's go in here the home buyer checklist part
[00:06:04] two
[00:06:06] So the first time we left off at the end of the first section here, which was the buyer initiation, right?
[00:06:14] I'm not covering lead gen at this time although I'm more than happy to do so in the future and
[00:06:19] Because at one point I had so many leads and I know I know that has set how this sounds
[00:06:23] But I had so many leads that I had to form a crew because I wasn't comfortable
[00:06:29] Like referring the leads out to someone in a different brokerage or a different crew
[00:06:33] Or I didn't know how they would treat my lead because the lead was
[00:06:38] They're my personal like friends and family so I just wanted to make sure that they're treated very well
[00:06:42] So I was like, you know what? Let me make this into a checklist
[00:06:44] Let me make this into a process. Let me grow the crew and that way I know
[00:06:48] Everybody that comes to me is taking care of in the same manner. Nothing is left unchecked
[00:06:54] Literally, so we have sent them by email number two and now there is a section here the next section
[00:07:02] I hope that this is bright enough. Let me make this brighter is
[00:07:05] Docs needed to submit an offer of course. This is going to vary state-to-state. So
[00:07:12] The first thing on this checklist is when you're calling the
[00:07:16] Yeah, when you're calling the listing agent
[00:07:20] You have to establish a good working relationship with them. I always being that I'm with eXp
[00:07:26] I always call and
[00:07:29] You know, I compliment them on their listing. It's a beautiful listing and I say oh by the way, you know
[00:07:34] My name is Ali Kars that I work with eXp. Realty. Don't worry. I'm not trying to recruit you and usually they lack because what do you know?
[00:07:41] Some eXp agents actually do sell so
[00:07:45] That usually breaks the ice, but I do everything that I can to butter them up right because if they're going to
[00:07:52] Be working with with me that does make my offer stand out over others over perhaps a grumpy REALTOR
[00:08:01] It shouldn't but it does and just being a genuinely good person and nice and incorporating some humor in this industry goes a very long way
[00:08:09] I'm sure I'm sure you can attest it as well. So
[00:08:14] I always have it a point to always call the listing agent before you even submit an offer because without that relationship
[00:08:23] They don't know who you are
[00:08:25] Sometimes they don't even check their email as you know you're getting tons of emails every single day
[00:08:31] Emails can get lost they can go to spam junk the deleted folder. So always call them
[00:08:37] Because at that point you can as you're over here step number two in this section is I literally wrote butter them up
[00:08:46] So ask what's most important to the seller and just let them talk
[00:08:51] Sometimes they will say a lot so that way you could make it a win-win for your buyer for the seller
[00:08:56] And then that way hopefully turns into more of a smooth transaction
[00:09:01] So before you submit an offer step number three here is of course a tell the lender there
[00:09:07] You don't want to blind sight the the lender at any point you want to make sure that the buyers qualify for that
[00:09:13] You want to make sure you're still keeping in contact with that lender throughout the whole transaction because what if something happens that the lender knows about although the
[00:09:21] You know client had to take had to cut down from 40 hours a week to 30 now they no longer qualify for that house
[00:09:29] So always make sure that you're keeping the lender up to date. Hey the client we looked at you know
[00:09:33] XYZ homes were said we're thinking of submitting an offer on this specific house
[00:09:37] Are they good to go and you get the blessing from the lender excellent?
[00:09:42] So then at that point of course you want with keeping the the lender informed every step of the way
[00:09:48] Just communication in general just goes such a long way
[00:09:54] Then that way the lender can reach out to the listing agent and
[00:09:58] Say by the way my name is pretend I'm the lender for a second my name is you know
[00:10:04] Ali Garcet I work with XYZ mortgage
[00:10:06] I just wanted to let you know that the clients that are about to spend an offer or that just submitted an offer
[00:10:11] They are good to go they're fully
[00:10:14] Pre-approved they are serious buyers and I will do whatever it takes to make this a smooth transaction
[00:10:19] It if your lender is not doing that ask them to do it because I'm sure that they want to do that because
[00:10:26] The more that they also talk to listing agents the more
[00:10:31] Their name gets known so if you shouldn't have any issues getting a lender to do that and there is a big difference between having them do that via
[00:10:40] Email via text or a phone call always ask them to do it via a phone call
[00:10:47] Because so many people aren't and on the listing side of things when whenever I said I get an offer
[00:10:54] Which is more often than not that that lender is not calling me so
[00:10:58] I make it a point and when I cover my seller checklist I make it a point. It's on there
[00:11:03] For me to reach out to that listing agent
[00:11:05] I do not accept any offer until I have spoken I'm the listing agent until the lender
[00:11:10] I make it a point to not accept any offer until I have spoken to the lender
[00:11:15] Directly and I know do they have to pull credit again?
[00:11:19] Is there any chance of this falling out of contract and you know expiresy?
[00:11:24] So carrying on here
[00:11:26] Send an email to the buyer
[00:11:28] Introducing them to the TC because at that point I hope that you have a TC if not
[00:11:34] Whoo once you hire one you will be able you're getting so much of your time back. So please please do that
[00:11:43] That way the email can say something like this and
[00:11:47] we can of course plug and play the T your TC's name so hey
[00:11:53] You know Alex is my buyer. I want to introduce you to my TC
[00:11:57] He or she is gonna be taking doing all the paperwork
[00:12:00] They do it better than me faster than me and make sure that everything is in regulation that we're on track
[00:12:05] so add this email to your contacts and
[00:12:09] And then of course introducing the TC to the client
[00:12:13] When you're ready to submit an offer and
[00:12:16] Then at that point this specifically is for my brokerage. So this is how to find
[00:12:22] Within our our database, which is which is what we call sky slope. That's where you input the
[00:12:28] The the forms
[00:12:29] There is some stuff that you'll realize. Oh, you might not realize. I know that I actually don't do
[00:12:35] So I don't do any of the the paperwork
[00:12:38] But my first transaction I did and that was a mistake
[00:12:42] Luckily, you know nothing nothing happened there, but um
[00:12:45] But it was just such a
[00:12:48] Not the highest and best use of my time
[00:12:50] So that is what a TC is is there for a lot of a lot of people sometimes think oh, you know
[00:12:57] I can't I don't have
[00:12:59] I'm not at the level of production for me for it to warrant me hiring a TC
[00:13:04] To which I would say if you cannot hire a TC now
[00:13:09] There is very little chance of you being able to scale unless your your goal is not to scale which is totally fine too
[00:13:16] Everyone has different
[00:13:19] Goals in this business, you know some people only want to do a couple and that's completely fine
[00:13:25] But I would say if you do like doing the paperwork then I don't know
[00:13:29] Maybe maybe just be a TC and scale that business, but anyway, so
[00:13:34] Not everything on here is
[00:13:36] Specifically what I do, but if for some reason you are still doing the paperwork and if you happen to be an eXp
[00:13:42] And happen to be in Arizona this might help you otherwise you can just ignore that part of course
[00:13:47] You know you can delete it after we meet and talk and you get these chocolates. You can just delete that portion
[00:13:52] I will say though you'll be given a link to this so copy and paste it
[00:13:58] Please do not edit my checklist that I am sharing for everyone
[00:14:04] So hopefully you shouldn't have access to do that but just in case please don't take this copy and make any edits to it
[00:14:12] That's the one thing that I ask
[00:14:14] Okay, so then you send the buyer broker exclusive agreement in case you haven't already and I'm not gonna really talk about at what point
[00:14:21] I do it because everyone likes to do it at different times some people only like to do it when they submit the offer
[00:14:27] Some people do it before they've been like viewing house a lot of different
[00:14:31] theories and pros and cons to every to every
[00:14:34] You know decision on that so at whatever point you want to submit
[00:14:38] You want to send and have your
[00:14:40] buyer exclusive agreement signed then you can just drag and drop that which is super easy again on Trello
[00:14:46] You can just drag and drop it to this card or before or after
[00:14:50] Then you send these are the forms here that we have to send to our clients in this state so
[00:14:57] Again, make sure that that's appropriate for your state all of these forms here and of course
[00:15:02] I am not sending these a T.C. Is because again, that's not the highest-invest use of my time
[00:15:08] I'll tell you my first transaction that I ever did it took me to
[00:15:12] Maybe even three hours to even find the paperwork
[00:15:16] Three hours after my first year in the business. I did the math and I was per hour per client
[00:15:24] On average I was making like 250 to 300 dollars an hour for me to spend three hours
[00:15:31] Looking to even find where these forms are kept. No, thank you
[00:15:35] That is not a way to scale. I will never do that again. So highly suggest hiring a T.C. because
[00:15:41] They only get paid at the transaction. They only get paid when you get paid
[00:15:44] There are no overhead costs anyway. I'm going on a rabbit hole. I'm sure you guys are with me also
[00:15:50] So let me continue going down here
[00:15:53] sending the purchase contract
[00:15:56] That's after you know, of course all the details of what's gonna go in the purchase contract
[00:16:01] and
[00:16:02] That is where I'm going to take you to buy your email number three
[00:16:10] Which is once you get to that point with your client of you know, you've shown or you've hired a
[00:16:17] Showing assistant to show your client houses and the filing arrow down one and they're ready to go
[00:16:23] They're excited excellent. This is where I this is my process from there
[00:16:28] I send this email and again. I use superhuman. It's a way to save a lot of time and
[00:16:35] easily have
[00:16:37] Drafts or templates like very ready to go so I
[00:16:42] Send this email to the clients. So obviously I'll put them in the two line buyer email number three is with a subject line
[00:16:48] drafting the offer and the next steps of course
[00:16:51] I'm always adding next steps because that's what the buyer wants to know great
[00:16:55] This is what we're doing now, but what do I expect tomorrow? What do I expect the next what's next?
[00:16:59] So of course like in every single one of my videos. I or emails
[00:17:04] I have a video because I love video because it goes so much further if clients
[00:17:09] I'm gonna scroll down here if clients were to just see all of this by itself with a lot of words
[00:17:16] That's putting a lot of work on them and you want to make this as smooth as possible for them. So
[00:17:23] In this video once again of this email. I'm pretty much reading this email to them
[00:17:29] It's story time again. I want to make it as easy as possible for them
[00:17:34] so
[00:17:35] I am telling them what exactly we need in order to draft the offer and
[00:17:41] You'll you'll realize here. I have a graph. So on the left side
[00:17:44] It's like the calm of of what I'm looking for
[00:17:47] So of course the buyer names of phone numbers emails. You'll probably have it already
[00:17:51] The address the purchase price take your contract your your purchase contract or offer to purchase wherever you're located and
[00:18:00] Every single line item that needs to be written written in turn that into a graph
[00:18:06] Just two columns the left side is what you're looking for the right side is blank and you send that is
[00:18:11] Template that's your buyer email number three
[00:18:15] So in that way I send this out to the buyers and they are the ones filling this out
[00:18:20] One that provides them with more clarity. Okay, this is exactly what I'm doing. It gives them more ownership
[00:18:27] They're the ones writing it in and of course it goes through every single portion of the
[00:18:35] purchase contract so at the bottom here, or actually let me scroll back up
[00:18:40] So after my video, which is just a one-minute video explaining what is in this email
[00:18:44] I also added another video which is the purchase contract overview now
[00:18:49] They have already received this in buyer email number two if you remember because buyer email number two has my
[00:18:56] buyer pdf which is my video collection of taking the buyer from the very beginning all into the very close
[00:19:03] End of the transaction asking for the review and so I clicked on this already and this the buyer contract overview is on
[00:19:12] YouTube and it could be
[00:19:14] Unlisted it could be listed if you want
[00:19:19] Here you go. Maybe you heard that maybe you didn't but pretty much that's how it starts out
[00:19:23] Hey, congratulations. You're under contract. What happens now and I walk them
[00:19:29] Through what the rest of the contract is going to be like so
[00:19:33] Very beefy. There's a lot of information, but my clients have never said, you know what? I think you offered too much information
[00:19:41] So that way they have that available and then of course, so they're filling in this information that goes into the contract, right?
[00:19:48] Then the bottom section here is the way ahead. So one I
[00:19:53] Want you to email us back and I say us because it's me and the TC so in the in the two line
[00:19:59] It's the buyers that are going to be signing the CC line is the the TC email us back
[00:20:05] I will be looking it over first of course you want to make sure that the price is what you spoke about that the numbers make sense
[00:20:11] That everything is on there
[00:20:13] because ultimately you are responsible for that so
[00:20:18] After and then number two is tell your lender
[00:20:22] Of how much you're offering just again in case in case for some reason the buyer didn't talk to the lender
[00:20:28] They're the ones reaching out to the lender as well as you are saying hey just confirming again
[00:20:34] We're we're making an offer on one two three main street. This is the price
[00:20:39] Sign number three is for them to sign the offer number four on their list of the way ahead is I will be
[00:20:45] Presenting this to the listing agent and letting them know it's in their inbox
[00:20:49] Number five is the lender is going to call the listing agent and I'm telling the buyer this right like hey your lender and I are working together to do the most we can for you
[00:20:59] It's a team effort and the number six be on the lookout and
[00:21:03] For the next email which should be we're under contract and
[00:21:08] Then the attachments here that I have are the buyer advisory again. This is state specific
[00:21:14] So I won't open that up but also again. I touched the buyer client pdf again. This is the whole like video
[00:21:22] Course pretty much on buying in your state. So this of course takes a lot of effort to make
[00:21:28] But it is so worth it once you make it because
[00:21:32] It should be evergreen and it should apply to all buyers. So you send it
[00:21:37] They send it back to you saying okay, this is this is what it is if you need to jump on a call saying
[00:21:42] I thought we spoke about this much earnest money or
[00:21:45] That you were not gonna ask for a home warranty
[00:21:48] Whatever it is at that point if it warns a phone call excellent if not you're ready to go all you have to do is
[00:21:54] Text your TC saying the email that you were just CCed on the the draft in the offer good to go can you draft it up and
[00:22:02] Yeah, so that's that's buyer email number three
[00:22:06] Going back to the trello checklist now
[00:22:09] Let me move this here
[00:22:11] So we have sent out the the offer
[00:22:14] um
[00:22:15] And at this point they have sent us back to
[00:22:19] Back to it. I don't want to jump too far ahead
[00:22:21] Because they're again there are a lot if you're following along on youtube if this has been helpful so far again
[00:22:27] Please like this video
[00:22:29] Comment on it saying what portion has been the most useful to you if you're interested in setting up a call
[00:22:36] Text checklist 520 341 2552 but whatever platform you're listening to this whether Spotify Apple please
[00:22:43] Give keeping it real a five-star review because DJ does so much for the agent community and I really appreciate him
[00:22:50] Okay, so you take the prequel of course you're gonna be submitting the offer with the prequel
[00:22:54] I don't I don't mean to say of course. I want I want this to apply to all
[00:22:59] agents of all
[00:23:00] levels so
[00:23:02] Then
[00:23:03] Once you have all the documents and disseminate the listing agent follow it up with the highlights
[00:23:10] So once that once your TC has sent
[00:23:15] Has drafted the offer the buyers have signed you've already looked it over you're good to go then at that point
[00:23:20] And it becomes a decision whether you want to send the offer to the listing agent or your TC
[00:23:25] I have my TC do it and specifically in there I have
[00:23:29] um
[00:23:31] The I write my own blurb of what I want the TC to copy and paste
[00:23:35] But they're the ones submitting it to the listing agent one it takes it saves some of my time and two
[00:23:43] It comes from the TC to the listing agent so in that way the listing agent is seeing okay
[00:23:48] Ally has a TC. Let me make sure that I keep them in the loop because I'm sure that you have all experienced this where
[00:23:56] Cross agents forget forget to CC the TC and that's like the most important important person to be CC'd
[00:24:04] So I want the conversations the communication to be from the TC from the start so then we they know like hey
[00:24:10] She needs to be CCed on everything
[00:24:13] So in what what am I
[00:24:16] typing out for the TC to put in the blurb right
[00:24:21] Because we never send emails that are just like hey attaches the offer let me know you know
[00:24:25] Please confirm receipt and then I attach the offer that's the worst thing you could do
[00:24:29] um
[00:24:30] What I do is I make sure that I highlight all of the main points purchase price earn us money closing date
[00:24:36] What we're asking for seller concessions every portion of it in in bullets
[00:24:41] I'm not writing a paragraph no one wants to read a paragraph
[00:24:44] It's bullet form we super look forward to you
[00:24:47] um, we look forward to a smooth transaction. I'm the TC. I'm working with with Ali Gar said and
[00:24:54] Afterward, I call the listing agent. Hey, just want to confirm that you received it
[00:24:58] We super look forward to making this as smooth of a transaction as possible and I mean that and
[00:25:06] So that way the first time they're getting an email is not just an offer that they found their junk and you know that
[00:25:13] You can do so much better
[00:25:14] Um, if you want to go above and beyond that
[00:25:18] You can jump on bomb bomb, which is what I'm using right now to share my screen and you can make a video saying hey
[00:25:25] um, Leslie, I love your listing. I know that we've spoken. I just wanted to add this video to this email
[00:25:31] I wanted to introduce you this email is coming actually from my TC her name is Laura. You can you know
[00:25:36] Please add her as a contact in your email so emails don't get lost. Please see see her on everything
[00:25:41] This offer is the best one that we could have made
[00:25:44] I spoke to my clients and this is what we're offering. Please let me know if you have any questions
[00:25:48] And I look forward to working with you
[00:25:50] Uh, you know, it doesn't have to be long like 30 seconds max. So
[00:25:54] That's if you wanted to go above and beyond. I don't yet do that. So do that
[00:25:58] and okay
[00:26:00] I spent enough time on that on that section here
[00:26:03] Here at this next uh item on the on the checklist is
[00:26:07] Unfortunate that we have to write this but it happens not everyone is honest
[00:26:15] So screenshot on the MLS how much that um how much the co-broker percentage is gonna be
[00:26:23] Essentially how much you're getting paid because it i've heard it happen a bunch of times where in the beginning
[00:26:29] It'll say 3% but then you go under contract you look at the MLS again and you you know
[00:26:35] You get paid only 2% or something like that
[00:26:38] You want to make sure that if they said that they were going to be paying you 3 that you get paid 3
[00:26:43] So screenshot
[00:26:45] From the MLS and save it in your records save it in a file you can throw it into the
[00:26:50] Trello checklist directly as an attachment
[00:26:53] However, you save it just make sure that you have a copy of that because
[00:26:57] It shouldn't happen but it happens sometimes and that's unfortunate
[00:27:01] so
[00:27:01] Um and going over here again before you submit the offer call the listing agent i've already actually spoken over this
[00:27:09] Spoken about this already so that way everyone knows the ins and outs of the offer
[00:27:14] Send the private report or save the private report
[00:27:18] Okay, that has the commission split. This is being redundant
[00:27:21] But again it happens make sure that you do it um and then ensure that the proof of funds or the prequel letter actually matches
[00:27:28] The name of the contract. Yes. This is clearly a lesson learned on my end where somebody you know got pre approved with their own personal name
[00:27:35] Then wanted to buy with an LLC or they added another party or you know etc etc. Just make sure
[00:27:42] Um that the numbers match, you know
[00:27:44] Are we offering six oh six oh one and when they're only qualified for 600
[00:27:48] Just because things change especially as you work with a buyer that is on a little bit more of an extended timeline
[00:27:55] Anything can happen their original pre approval
[00:27:59] Um, they may have swayed from that they could be pre-approved more they could be pre-approved for less so just make sure
[00:28:05] Then the next category of this trello checklist is when the buyer is under contract
[00:28:12] So at that point the first thing here is send buyer email number four. Let's take a look at that
[00:28:19] Because what's buyer email number four?
[00:28:21] It is the congratulations. We are under contract email and again my
[00:28:26] My buyer emails and my seller emails are one through six
[00:28:29] So this is email number four out of six that the buyers will be receiving
[00:28:33] What do I start it off with? You guessed it a video of me saying who who were under contract?
[00:28:40] Congratulations. I'm so excited for you and
[00:28:44] Giving let them know what happens now what happens next? So I hit them with a to-do list
[00:28:51] This is your homework
[00:28:52] Add the transaction coordinator in case you haven't already to your contacts. They're going to be emailing you all the paperwork
[00:28:59] Why are the earnest money deposit
[00:29:01] Immediately as soon as you can
[00:29:04] Because in and of course to state dependent however long your state allows to do that
[00:29:10] I know that some states do non-refundable earnest money and
[00:29:14] Number three is pay for the inspections
[00:29:16] We won't be able to receive a copy of the inspections until you have paid for it
[00:29:21] This is about how much to expect for a home inspection and of course
[00:29:26] You know see these and I say say these into a digital file
[00:29:29] You can take it off your tax is at the end of the year but talk to a CPA to confirm. I'm not a CPA
[00:29:35] So I tell them more or less what they're expecting to pay for the inspections at this point
[00:29:40] This is nothing new. I've already told them this in the buyer initiation
[00:29:44] So that way they know because in our contract
[00:29:48] Or what I want from them in buyer email number three is also what inspections do you plan on doing
[00:29:53] So in that way
[00:29:55] It lets me know should we stay should we stick with that 10-day due diligence or do they want a lot of inspections where we might need to extend it
[00:30:05] So I want to know that upfront number four in their homework the buyer buyer's homework to do is talk to the lender
[00:30:12] Let them know when you want to schedule the appraisal
[00:30:14] This was very important a couple of years ago during you know 2021-2022
[00:30:18] Where homes wanted homes were just flying off right and the the sellers wanted the quickest clothes as possible
[00:30:27] So the quick it the quicker the buyer could confirm that they were going to
[00:30:33] Close on the house
[00:30:35] During the due diligence period as soon as they realized yes, I like it the home inspections came in pretty good
[00:30:40] Let's order the appraisal as soon as they could order the appraisal they would tell tell the lender the lender orders the appraisal
[00:30:46] And then that way it saves time and you can close faster
[00:30:50] so
[00:30:53] Sometimes and I know I don't want to be too state-specific here, but at least in Arizona
[00:31:00] Standard is 10 days due diligence period, you know if the inspections come back and they don't like it
[00:31:05] They don't even like you know how the house
[00:31:07] Whatever the way the wind blows near the house they can just cancel usually look at their money
[00:31:11] They're earnest money back because we don't have non-refundable earnest money
[00:31:16] But if they so if they like it during that due diligence period if they know that they're going to continue
[00:31:21] Boom, let's order the appraisal. Let's order the appraisal sooner rather than later
[00:31:26] Again, I explain the risk that in case if you want to order the appraisal fast
[00:31:33] To close faster there is a risk that you might end up paying for an appraisal that you don't end up needing
[00:31:39] You know because if the appraisers are booking out two weeks and we order it now
[00:31:45] But then by the time we get all the inspections back in 10 days and you realize that you don't want to continue
[00:31:51] That that appraiser might still be charging you so it's up to them whether or not they want to spend the around 600 bucks
[00:31:58] Sometimes they do they're like yeah, I want to close fast
[00:32:00] Sometimes they're like you know what no, let's wait until all the inspections come back and we agree on the
[00:32:06] rehab or the fixes so
[00:32:10] Number five is
[00:32:12] Once we have all the inspections back do not fret. I literally have it here written out all inspections reports are 60 to 70 pages long
[00:32:21] Whether the home was built in the 1800s or it's a new build it will be as lengthy as possible. It's going to make you feel bad
[00:32:29] Don't freak out. I want to talk to you first
[00:32:32] You know once we
[00:32:34] Skett once we get those inspections back because it's the apprais it's the inspectors job and explain this to them
[00:32:40] It's the inspectors job to point out every single imperfection
[00:32:44] So that's what they're getting paid for they're not going to say oh man the condition of this roof is beautiful
[00:32:51] Great roof. They're never going to put that in a report. They're only going to put everything negative so
[00:32:57] I let the buyers know that especially if the first time home buyers and
[00:33:01] Number six if there are major repairs needed let's discuss renegotiating renegotiating. It's so that pretty weird renegotiating
[00:33:09] Um, okay, so whatever may come from the inspections we have to give in the state again very this is almost only talking about Arizona
[00:33:17] Um, we have to give the seller the opportunity to fix before we can talk about
[00:33:21] uh
[00:33:22] Closing costs or you know seller paying toward closing
[00:33:25] costs or reducing the price
[00:33:27] So I'll just leave it at that just because I don't I want this to apply to as many people as possible
[00:33:33] And of course seven does apply to everyone do not buy any large items until you close in this property
[00:33:38] If you have any questions talk to your lender first. Hey, can I buy this? Hey, can I buy that um
[00:33:44] Don't risk losing the property
[00:33:45] Number eight is if it's applicable call the solar company and start transferring the lease over to your name
[00:33:51] Um, number nine is review the pie pie or the buyer packet pdf again and watch those videos that apply and
[00:34:00] Number 10 is if you are getting an appraisal after the inspection period is over
[00:34:05] You'll tell your lender to order the appraisal so
[00:34:09] That's kind of like a repeat, but it's it's very important
[00:34:13] Now at the bottom here. I said I have it written watch this video for extra information
[00:34:18] And what is that video that's the oh yeah, I think that's the overall
[00:34:25] I'm under contract video
[00:34:27] Oops, let's look out of that. Hopefully you couldn't hear that
[00:34:30] Um, that was a nad
[00:34:32] So that's the under contract video and what do I attach the buyer client pdf again this it from buyer email number two
[00:34:39] All the way until the end they are seeing the same pdf because it's it's their whole course, right the buyer the buyer um
[00:34:47] Uh, the whole overall process so maybe buyer email number two is where they just watch the first couple of videos by email number three
[00:34:55] So they don't have to keep digging. Oh, yeah, where is that buyer pdf again?
[00:34:59] They're not gonna have saved it's not their job too
[00:35:01] So again, you want to make it as easy as possible for them to work with you and give you a great five star review
[00:35:09] And then at the bottom of the email, of course, I have the way ahead your next to do list email will be your week before
[00:35:16] closing checklist and I want to go back to the trello
[00:35:21] So that's um buyer under escrow. I'm going to finish this section here and then
[00:35:27] Yeah, let me let me finish this section here
[00:35:29] So as soon as you're under contract tell the lender again this the lender should have already been kept up to date because you have a checklist
[00:35:36] Where you're talking to the lender and you're telling the buyer to talk to the lender
[00:35:40] And then you're under contract at this point
[00:35:43] They're happy. They're excited. Sometimes they're nervous of course with you know, good reason
[00:35:48] It's probably the most expensive purchase of their life or one of them
[00:35:50] um
[00:35:52] Ask for referral. Hey, I'm so happy that like that you're so happy
[00:35:55] Do you is there anyone else that I can also make happy? Do you know of anyone else looking to buy or sell here in in cert city and
[00:36:04] um
[00:36:04] You know that's a great way to get a great time to get referrals
[00:36:09] If I know a lot of agents do this I I personally don't
[00:36:13] Uh, but not for any like specific reason. This is also a great way a great time to get
[00:36:19] Uh, review so a Google review. Hey up until this port up up until this point uh, this is my agent in this city
[00:36:26] And it's been amazing so far. We're super excited. We just went on a contract. Keep you posted
[00:36:29] You know, so you cannot you can ask for a review then to
[00:36:35] With or in lieu of the uh referral
[00:36:38] So of course you've submitted the offer um, you're making sure that the buyer has
[00:36:45] Wired the earnest money and you want to talk to the title company make sure that they did that or however your state works
[00:36:52] If you're looking at a quick close tell the title to rush the haway paperwork that will cost extra of course you have to tell your client that
[00:37:00] If you are even in an haway area that is a lot of what we had to do in
[00:37:07] 2022 and
[00:37:09] Ask them what type of inspections that they want to have in the property. This has already been done
[00:37:14] You've already sent the under contract now what email
[00:37:16] Ensure that the seller is going to have uh either a contractor lock box
[00:37:21] So this is state dependent too. It some states allow that the inspectors can just go there without you without an agent
[00:37:27] Some states don't so Arizona you have to be there with the inspector
[00:37:32] So make sure that you know whatever that whichever way it is that it applies um, they're staying in the regs
[00:37:38] It regulations. Sorry. That was like a military term that I got used to um, so then you confirmed the deposit to the escrow or title
[00:37:46] You're looking at the title commitment look at who's the seller is the name who you thought it was
[00:37:51] uh, and you just want to make sure that
[00:37:56] You're you're you're probably seeing some overlap here too where like this is of course on this on the listing agents responsibility
[00:38:03] But you also want to make sure
[00:38:05] Probably even before you place an offer that when you're making an offer who who it's too is actually on the county records of who it own who who owns it
[00:38:15] So I hope that explained that correct um in in the way that you can understand so at that point you um
[00:38:23] Confirmed that the lender ordered the appraisal if there is an appraisal you've scheduled the inspections or the TC has
[00:38:32] And they just let you know um either you're going to be out there or another agent a showing agent can be out there
[00:38:37] Again state dependent
[00:38:40] out of tier calendar if you are going to be doing that and
[00:38:43] Collect the HOA documents if that's applicable remove any contingencies as you're continuing through the transaction
[00:38:50] The home warranty at that point
[00:38:53] Do finalize a social media post. Hey like we're under contract. Maybe you could share a real of course no specifics
[00:38:58] But that you're excited for your client
[00:39:01] That will generate more more referrals
[00:39:04] schedule a photo with the clients bring the
[00:39:08] I have bring the marketing key
[00:39:11] uh and then at that point you contact the title company and you ask them for
[00:39:17] The commission instruction form
[00:39:20] How you want to get paid whether you're picking up a check which I think just don't don't
[00:39:24] Don't drive to go pick up a check
[00:39:25] Just like I don't suggest you driving to go to your growth to go to the grocery store to go grocery shopping
[00:39:31] on Instacart
[00:39:33] So I I'm just like not a fan. I'm driving. I think it's like really big waste of time unless you're being driven around and able to work in the back seat
[00:39:42] Uh, but maybe that's just how my brain works
[00:39:43] So you want to make sure of course when that dude when the inspection period ends
[00:39:49] Uh, you want to know all the timelines you and your tc should have those dates like memorized and
[00:39:55] And while actually maybe instead of even memorizing it
[00:39:58] This is what I do in the title. Would you scroll all the way up on this checklist? I have it
[00:40:03] Here as as a template for the title pp purchase price close of escrow earnus money do diligence period
[00:40:09] So that way you know exactly what date it ends who is this for um all of the biggest highlights or if there's some some big to do
[00:40:17] Uh, you can add it to the title so in that way as you see all of these you know as you continue getting more and more buyers
[00:40:25] Under contract, you know
[00:40:27] exactly
[00:40:28] Where you're at in the process. So let me go back in here
[00:40:34] Then where was I um, okay
[00:40:39] If during escrow your client messes up the deal or the client like or the deal falls through on your end
[00:40:47] Send the cross agent flowers chocolate champagne candy to their office with a card that says
[00:40:55] Hey Leslie, I'm so sorry about what happened with the transaction
[00:40:57] You know, even if it wasn't your fault if you worked with them and you liked working with them
[00:41:02] Send them something of gratitude. It goes such a long way because agents don't really show gratitude to each other
[00:41:08] So I'm so sorry about what happened with this transaction on 123 L most street
[00:41:12] I know that you have a backup offer already and you're probably and that you're under contract with another offer
[00:41:17] But again, I just wanted to say I'm so sorry. Thank you so much for the time that we did work together
[00:41:21] This goes such a long way even if it was the most terrible actually especially if it was the most terrible transaction
[00:41:28] At least they realize you're a person you care you spent time out of your day to send them something
[00:41:33] And it's to their office. So they're like oh man, you got balloons what for oh a transaction that caught on fire like what
[00:41:40] And they sent you balloons like that's you know, just think about that that that's such a
[00:41:44] I don't know. I love this. I love this so much um
[00:41:47] Or like vice versa if the cross agent just goes above and beyond or maybe they don't even need to go above and breathe beyond
[00:41:54] Send them balloons anyway
[00:41:55] Send them a little candy like lifesavers candy and card to their office saying how much you want to thank them for saving the deal
[00:42:02] Or just for being a great cross agent and ask them for their Google business review where or business page where you can review them
[00:42:12] An agent to agent review. I think goes such such a long way and I love giving agent reviews agents reviews
[00:42:20] You know, of course if if I work with them because as people are seeing as people are googling
[00:42:26] agents near them and they see oh this agent has a good reputation amongst other agents
[00:42:32] That goes a long way
[00:42:35] so
[00:42:36] It takes all but a minute of your time
[00:42:39] Uh, okay, how to find signed documents
[00:42:42] This is specific again. I hope that you were using a tc to do this. So I'm going to skip over this one
[00:42:48] Ask the buyer when they want to order the appraisal again. This is already in the checklist
[00:42:53] It's it's it's redundant for a reason
[00:42:56] So if there's going to be a post possession post possessions were very very common
[00:42:59] I'm sure your brokerage has a post possession form if not maybe ask the broker for one
[00:43:05] um
[00:43:06] Because they they need to have been told to seek legal counsel because there's a lot of
[00:43:12] Variations a lot of things that could go wrong. You just want to make sure that you are covered
[00:43:17] um, and then once the appraisal comes back then if it's at a price or even higher
[00:43:23] Congratulations, that is a phone call to the buyer saying congratulations
[00:43:27] Not only you know, did we get the offer in a we got you under contract the price you wanted the terms you wanted
[00:43:35] But you are getting equity instant equity as soon as you close and this is how much like
[00:43:41] Because sometimes they'll they'll receive the appraisal, but they don't know how to read it
[00:43:45] You know, so interpret it for them. Don't be like oh, I had to see that appraisal. Hey congrats like you know
[00:43:50] You got 15k they might not even know what page tape and find that so of course read it uh baby it as much as you can to them
[00:43:59] And at the buyer's owner contract on a home with the pool add the again on just a pool
[00:44:04] Safety notice in case
[00:44:06] You need that
[00:44:08] And tell the title company if the buyer is military because a lot of title companies will have
[00:44:13] Military discounts police or first responder discounts educator discounts
[00:44:17] Just ask the title companies. What kind of discounts they offer and
[00:44:22] Make sure that that is applied for the buyer
[00:44:25] so
[00:44:26] The binser here this other section is
[00:44:29] Is an Arizona specific term, but pretty much in Arizona even though it's like it's an as is state when the buyer gets the inspections back
[00:44:39] They have the option to renegotiate so the seller can so we so we we renegotiate right sometimes say hey
[00:44:47] Can you actually fix this or that those really pretty major items?
[00:44:50] Um the the seller can say no
[00:44:52] So in this case here. I have if the seller decides to reject the buyer's binser
[00:44:56] That means that the the the form
[00:44:59] That means that the buyer now has five days to decide whether or not they want to proceed
[00:45:04] So it's kind of like another just renegotiate period of course that that applies to only
[00:45:09] Arizona
[00:45:10] There you might have something similar in your state
[00:45:12] so
[00:45:13] That is where I think I'm going to end to days
[00:45:18] Let me see because the next is going to be the before closing checklist
[00:45:21] Which is the two weeks out which correlates to email number five that is where I will start it next
[00:45:28] Um for the next episode
[00:45:30] If you have any questions again, I am more than happy to reach to talk to you guys about it
[00:45:37] I am already like super excited with the amount of like people that I've been meeting with and talking them up with these about these checklist
[00:45:44] Uh similar to to me like
[00:45:47] Growing the crew. I don't want to just like throw everything at you
[00:45:50] I want to like talk you through it because trello this is a lot. There is so much on here
[00:45:54] So again, this is a great way for you to leverage and and continue growing your crew knowing
[00:46:00] Once you have perfected it say you're the team leader. So you're the broker owner once you have perfected it with your state
[00:46:06] Your forms that are needed your
[00:46:08] You know templates in here
[00:46:10] Um at that point you can just have the agents on your team copy and paste this and you know

I'm sharing my trello Screen again and again trello for those I have not used it is a free project management tool free Where you can create cards or boards and you can list out every single item on a checklist and you can You share this as you can see I I share it with my crew and they can copy and paste it So in that and move it into their own board again leverage So you create the template and they can just copy and paste it and include their own address And then yeah, so let's go in here the home buyer checklist part two So the first time we left off at the end of the first section here, which was the buyer initiation, right? I'm not covering lead gen at this time although I'm more than happy to do so in the future and Because at one point I had so many leads and I know I know that has set how this sounds But I had so many leads that I had to form a crew because I wasn't comfortable Like referring the leads out to someone in a different brokerage or a different crew Or I didn't know how they would treat my lead because the lead was They're my personal like friends and family so I just wanted to make sure that they're treated very well So I was like, you know what? Let me make this into a checklist Let me make this into a process. Let me grow the crew and that way I know Everybody that comes to me is taking care of in the same manner. Nothing is left unchecked Literally, so we have sent them by email number two and now there is a section here the next section I hope that this is bright enough. Let me make this brighter is Docs needed to submit an offer of course. This is going to vary state-to-state. So The first thing on this checklist is when you're calling the Yeah, when you're calling the listing agent You have to establish a good working relationship with them. I always being that I'm with eXp I always call and You know, I compliment them on their listing. It's a beautiful listing and I say oh by the way, you know My name is Ali Kars that I work with eXp. Realty. Don't worry. I'm not trying to recruit you and usually they lack because what do you know? Some eXp agents actually do sell so That usually breaks the ice, but I do everything that I can to butter them up right because if they're going to Be working with with me that does make my offer stand out over others over perhaps a grumpy REALTOR It shouldn't but it does and just being a genuinely good person and nice and incorporating some humor in this industry goes a very long way I'm sure I'm sure you can attest it as well. So I always have it a point to always call the listing agent before you even submit an offer because without that relationship They don't know who you are Sometimes they don't even check their email as you know you're getting tons of emails every single day Emails can get lost they can go to spam junk the deleted folder. So always call them Because at that point you can as you're over here step number two in this section is I literally wrote butter them up So ask what's most important to the seller and just let them talk Sometimes they will say a lot so that way you could make it a win-win for your buyer for the seller And then that way hopefully turns into more of a smooth transaction So before you submit an offer step number three here is of course a tell the lender there You don't want to blind sight the the lender at any point you want to make sure that the buyers qualify for that You want to make sure you're still keeping in contact with that lender throughout the whole transaction because what if something happens that the lender knows about although the You know client had to take had to cut down from 40 hours a week to 30 now they no longer qualify for that house So always make sure that you're keeping the lender up to date. Hey the client we looked at you know XYZ homes were said we're thinking of submitting an offer on this specific house Are they good to go and you get the blessing from the lender excellent? So then at that point of course you want with keeping the the lender informed every step of the way Just communication in general just goes such a long way Then that way the lender can reach out to the listing agent and Say by the way my name is pretend I'm the lender for a second my name is you know Ali Garcet I work with XYZ mortgage I just wanted to let you know that the clients that are about to spend an offer or that just submitted an offer They are good to go they're fully Pre-approved they are serious buyers and I will do whatever it takes to make this a smooth transaction It if your lender is not doing that ask them to do it because I'm sure that they want to do that because The more that they also talk to listing agents the more Their name gets known so if you shouldn't have any issues getting a lender to do that and there is a big difference between having them do that via Email via text or a phone call always ask them to do it via a phone call Because so many people aren't and on the listing side of things when whenever I said I get an offer Which is more often than not that that lender is not calling me so I make it a point and when I cover my seller checklist I make it a point. It's on there For me to reach out to that listing agent I do not accept any offer until I have spoken I'm the listing agent until the lender I make it a point to not accept any offer until I have spoken to the lender Directly and I know do they have to pull credit again? Is there any chance of this falling out of contract and you know expiresy? So carrying on here Send an email to the buyer Introducing them to the TC because at that point I hope that you have a TC if not Whoo once you hire one you will be able you're getting so much of your time back. So please please do that That way the email can say something like this and we can of course plug and play the T your TC's name so hey You know Alex is my buyer. I want to introduce you to my TC He or she is gonna be taking doing all the paperwork They do it better than me faster than me and make sure that everything is in regulation that we're on track so add this email to your contacts and And then of course introducing the TC to the client When you're ready to submit an offer and Then at that point this specifically is for my brokerage. So this is how to find Within our our database, which is which is what we call sky slope. That's where you input the The the forms There is some stuff that you'll realize. Oh, you might not realize. I know that I actually don't do So I don't do any of the the paperwork But my first transaction I did and that was a mistake Luckily, you know nothing nothing happened there, but um But it was just such a Not the highest and best use of my time So that is what a TC is is there for a lot of a lot of people sometimes think oh, you know I can't I don't have I'm not at the level of production for me for it to warrant me hiring a TC To which I would say if you cannot hire a TC now There is very little chance of you being able to scale unless your your goal is not to scale which is totally fine too Everyone has different Goals in this business, you know some people only want to do a couple and that's completely fine But I would say if you do like doing the paperwork then I don't know Maybe maybe just be a TC and scale that business, but anyway, so Not everything on here is Specifically what I do, but if for some reason you are still doing the paperwork and if you happen to be an eXp And happen to be in Arizona this might help you otherwise you can just ignore that part of course You know you can delete it after we meet and talk and you get these chocolates. You can just delete that portion I will say though you'll be given a link to this so copy and paste it Please do not edit my checklist that I am sharing for everyone So hopefully you shouldn't have access to do that but just in case please don't take this copy and make any edits to it That's the one thing that I ask Okay, so then you send the buyer broker exclusive agreement in case you haven't already and I'm not gonna really talk about at what point I do it because everyone likes to do it at different times some people only like to do it when they submit the offer Some people do it before they've been like viewing house a lot of different theories and pros and cons to every to every You know decision on that so at whatever point you want to submit You want to send and have your buyer exclusive agreement signed then you can just drag and drop that which is super easy again on Trello You can just drag and drop it to this card or before or after Then you send these are the forms here that we have to send to our clients in this state so Again, make sure that that's appropriate for your state all of these forms here and of course I am not sending these a T.C. Is because again, that's not the highest-invest use of my time I'll tell you my first transaction that I ever did it took me to Maybe even three hours to even find the paperwork Three hours after my first year in the business. I did the math and I was per hour per client On average I was making like 250 to 300 dollars an hour for me to spend three hours Looking to even find where these forms are kept. No, thank you That is not a way to scale. I will never do that again. So highly suggest hiring a T.C. because They only get paid at the transaction. They only get paid when you get paid There are no overhead costs anyway. I'm going on a rabbit hole. I'm sure you guys are with me also So let me continue going down here sending the purchase contract That's after you know, of course all the details of what's gonna go in the purchase contract and That is where I'm going to take you to buy your email number three Which is once you get to that point with your client of you know, you've shown or you've hired a Showing assistant to show your client houses and the filing arrow down one and they're ready to go They're excited excellent. This is where I this is my process from there I send this email and again. I use superhuman. It's a way to save a lot of time and easily have Drafts or templates like very ready to go so I Send this email to the clients. So obviously I'll put them in the two line buyer email number three is with a subject line drafting the offer and the next steps of course I'm always adding next steps because that's what the buyer wants to know great This is what we're doing now, but what do I expect tomorrow? What do I expect the next what's next? So of course like in every single one of my videos. I or emails I have a video because I love video because it goes so much further if clients I'm gonna scroll down here if clients were to just see all of this by itself with a lot of words That's putting a lot of work on them and you want to make this as smooth as possible for them. So In this video once again of this email. I'm pretty much reading this email to them It's story time again. I want to make it as easy as possible for them so I am telling them what exactly we need in order to draft the offer and You'll you'll realize here. I have a graph. So on the left side It's like the calm of of what I'm looking for So of course the buyer names of phone numbers emails. You'll probably have it already The address the purchase price take your contract your your purchase contract or offer to purchase wherever you're located and Every single line item that needs to be written written in turn that into a graph Just two columns the left side is what you're looking for the right side is blank and you send that is Template that's your buyer email number three So in that way I send this out to the buyers and they are the ones filling this out One that provides them with more clarity. Okay, this is exactly what I'm doing. It gives them more ownership They're the ones writing it in and of course it goes through every single portion of the purchase contract so at the bottom here, or actually let me scroll back up So after my video, which is just a one-minute video explaining what is in this email I also added another video which is the purchase contract overview now They have already received this in buyer email number two if you remember because buyer email number two has my buyer pdf which is my video collection of taking the buyer from the very beginning all into the very close End of the transaction asking for the review and so I clicked on this already and this the buyer contract overview is on YouTube and it could be Unlisted it could be listed if you want Here you go. Maybe you heard that maybe you didn't but pretty much that's how it starts out Hey, congratulations. You're under contract. What happens now and I walk them Through what the rest of the contract is going to be like so Very beefy. There's a lot of information, but my clients have never said, you know what? I think you offered too much information So that way they have that available and then of course, so they're filling in this information that goes into the contract, right? Then the bottom section here is the way ahead. So one I Want you to email us back and I say us because it's me and the TC so in the in the two line It's the buyers that are going to be signing the CC line is the the TC email us back I will be looking it over first of course you want to make sure that the price is what you spoke about that the numbers make sense That everything is on there because ultimately you are responsible for that so After and then number two is tell your lender Of how much you're offering just again in case in case for some reason the buyer didn't talk to the lender They're the ones reaching out to the lender as well as you are saying hey just confirming again We're we're making an offer on one two three main street. This is the price Sign number three is for them to sign the offer number four on their list of the way ahead is I will be Presenting this to the listing agent and letting them know it's in their inbox Number five is the lender is going to call the listing agent and I'm telling the buyer this right like hey your lender and I are working together to do the most we can for you It's a team effort and the number six be on the lookout and For the next email which should be we're under contract and Then the attachments here that I have are the buyer advisory again. This is state specific So I won't open that up but also again. I touched the buyer client pdf again. This is the whole like video Course pretty much on buying in your state. So this of course takes a lot of effort to make But it is so worth it once you make it because It should be evergreen and it should apply to all buyers. So you send it They send it back to you saying okay, this is this is what it is if you need to jump on a call saying I thought we spoke about this much earnest money or That you were not gonna ask for a home warranty Whatever it is at that point if it warns a phone call excellent if not you're ready to go all you have to do is Text your TC saying the email that you were just CCed on the the draft in the offer good to go can you draft it up and Yeah, so that's that's buyer email number three Going back to the trello checklist now Let me move this here So we have sent out the the offer um And at this point they have sent us back to Back to it. I don't want to jump too far ahead Because they're again there are a lot if you're following along on youtube if this has been helpful so far again Please like this video Comment on it saying what portion has been the most useful to you if you're interested in setting up a call Text checklist 520 341 2552 but whatever platform you're listening to this whether Spotify Apple please Give keeping it real a five-star review because DJ does so much for the agent community and I really appreciate him Okay, so you take the prequel of course you're gonna be submitting the offer with the prequel I don't I don't mean to say of course. I want I want this to apply to all agents of all levels so Then Once you have all the documents and disseminate the listing agent follow it up with the highlights So once that once your TC has sent Has drafted the offer the buyers have signed you've already looked it over you're good to go then at that point And it becomes a decision whether you want to send the offer to the listing agent or your TC I have my TC do it and specifically in there I have um The I write my own blurb of what I want the TC to copy and paste But they're the ones submitting it to the listing agent one it takes it saves some of my time and two It comes from the TC to the listing agent so in that way the listing agent is seeing okay Ally has a TC. Let me make sure that I keep them in the loop because I'm sure that you have all experienced this where Cross agents forget forget to CC the TC and that's like the most important important person to be CC'd So I want the conversations the communication to be from the TC from the start so then we they know like hey She needs to be CCed on everything So in what what am I typing out for the TC to put in the blurb right Because we never send emails that are just like hey attaches the offer let me know you know Please confirm receipt and then I attach the offer that's the worst thing you could do um What I do is I make sure that I highlight all of the main points purchase price earn us money closing date What we're asking for seller concessions every portion of it in in bullets I'm not writing a paragraph no one wants to read a paragraph It's bullet form we super look forward to you um, we look forward to a smooth transaction. I'm the TC. I'm working with with Ali Gar said and Afterward, I call the listing agent. Hey, just want to confirm that you received it We super look forward to making this as smooth of a transaction as possible and I mean that and So that way the first time they're getting an email is not just an offer that they found their junk and you know that You can do so much better Um, if you want to go above and beyond that You can jump on bomb bomb, which is what I'm using right now to share my screen and you can make a video saying hey um, Leslie, I love your listing. I know that we've spoken. I just wanted to add this video to this email I wanted to introduce you this email is coming actually from my TC her name is Laura. You can you know Please add her as a contact in your email so emails don't get lost. Please see see her on everything This offer is the best one that we could have made I spoke to my clients and this is what we're offering. Please let me know if you have any questions And I look forward to working with you Uh, you know, it doesn't have to be long like 30 seconds max. So That's if you wanted to go above and beyond. I don't yet do that. So do that and okay I spent enough time on that on that section here Here at this next uh item on the on the checklist is Unfortunate that we have to write this but it happens not everyone is honest So screenshot on the MLS how much that um how much the co-broker percentage is gonna be Essentially how much you're getting paid because it i've heard it happen a bunch of times where in the beginning It'll say 3% but then you go under contract you look at the MLS again and you you know You get paid only 2% or something like that You want to make sure that if they said that they were going to be paying you 3 that you get paid 3 So screenshot From the MLS and save it in your records save it in a file you can throw it into the Trello checklist directly as an attachment However, you save it just make sure that you have a copy of that because It shouldn't happen but it happens sometimes and that's unfortunate so Um and going over here again before you submit the offer call the listing agent i've already actually spoken over this Spoken about this already so that way everyone knows the ins and outs of the offer Send the private report or save the private report Okay, that has the commission split. This is being redundant But again it happens make sure that you do it um and then ensure that the proof of funds or the prequel letter actually matches The name of the contract. Yes. This is clearly a lesson learned on my end where somebody you know got pre approved with their own personal name Then wanted to buy with an LLC or they added another party or you know etc etc. Just make sure Um that the numbers match, you know Are we offering six oh six oh one and when they're only qualified for 600 Just because things change especially as you work with a buyer that is on a little bit more of an extended timeline Anything can happen their original pre approval Um, they may have swayed from that they could be pre-approved more they could be pre-approved for less so just make sure Then the next category of this trello checklist is when the buyer is under contract So at that point the first thing here is send buyer email number four. Let's take a look at that Because what's buyer email number four? It is the congratulations. We are under contract email and again my My buyer emails and my seller emails are one through six So this is email number four out of six that the buyers will be receiving What do I start it off with? You guessed it a video of me saying who who were under contract? Congratulations. I'm so excited for you and Giving let them know what happens now what happens next? So I hit them with a to-do list This is your homework Add the transaction coordinator in case you haven't already to your contacts. They're going to be emailing you all the paperwork Why are the earnest money deposit Immediately as soon as you can Because in and of course to state dependent however long your state allows to do that I know that some states do non-refundable earnest money and Number three is pay for the inspections We won't be able to receive a copy of the inspections until you have paid for it This is about how much to expect for a home inspection and of course You know see these and I say say these into a digital file You can take it off your tax is at the end of the year but talk to a CPA to confirm. I'm not a CPA So I tell them more or less what they're expecting to pay for the inspections at this point This is nothing new. I've already told them this in the buyer initiation So that way they know because in our contract Or what I want from them in buyer email number three is also what inspections do you plan on doing So in that way It lets me know should we stay should we stick with that 10-day due diligence or do they want a lot of inspections where we might need to extend it So I want to know that upfront number four in their homework the buyer buyer's homework to do is talk to the lender Let them know when you want to schedule the appraisal This was very important a couple of years ago during you know 2021-2022 Where homes wanted homes were just flying off right and the the sellers wanted the quickest clothes as possible So the quick it the quicker the buyer could confirm that they were going to Close on the house During the due diligence period as soon as they realized yes, I like it the home inspections came in pretty good Let's order the appraisal as soon as they could order the appraisal they would tell tell the lender the lender orders the appraisal And then that way it saves time and you can close faster so Sometimes and I know I don't want to be too state-specific here, but at least in Arizona Standard is 10 days due diligence period, you know if the inspections come back and they don't like it They don't even like you know how the house Whatever the way the wind blows near the house they can just cancel usually look at their money They're earnest money back because we don't have non-refundable earnest money But if they so if they like it during that due diligence period if they know that they're going to continue Boom, let's order the appraisal. Let's order the appraisal sooner rather than later Again, I explain the risk that in case if you want to order the appraisal fast To close faster there is a risk that you might end up paying for an appraisal that you don't end up needing You know because if the appraisers are booking out two weeks and we order it now But then by the time we get all the inspections back in 10 days and you realize that you don't want to continue That that appraiser might still be charging you so it's up to them whether or not they want to spend the around 600 bucks Sometimes they do they're like yeah, I want to close fast Sometimes they're like you know what no, let's wait until all the inspections come back and we agree on the rehab or the fixes so Number five is Once we have all the inspections back do not fret. I literally have it here written out all inspections reports are 60 to 70 pages long Whether the home was built in the 1800s or it's a new build it will be as lengthy as possible. It's going to make you feel bad Don't freak out. I want to talk to you first You know once we Skett once we get those inspections back because it's the apprais it's the inspectors job and explain this to them It's the inspectors job to point out every single imperfection So that's what they're getting paid for they're not going to say oh man the condition of this roof is beautiful Great roof. They're never going to put that in a report. They're only going to put everything negative so I let the buyers know that especially if the first time home buyers and Number six if there are major repairs needed let's discuss renegotiating renegotiating. It's so that pretty weird renegotiating Um, okay, so whatever may come from the inspections we have to give in the state again very this is almost only talking about Arizona Um, we have to give the seller the opportunity to fix before we can talk about uh Closing costs or you know seller paying toward closing costs or reducing the price So I'll just leave it at that just because I don't I want this to apply to as many people as possible And of course seven does apply to everyone do not buy any large items until you close in this property If you have any questions talk to your lender first. Hey, can I buy this? Hey, can I buy that um Don't risk losing the property Number eight is if it's applicable call the solar company and start transferring the lease over to your name Um, number nine is review the pie pie or the buyer packet pdf again and watch those videos that apply and Number 10 is if you are getting an appraisal after the inspection period is over You'll tell your lender to order the appraisal so That's kind of like a repeat, but it's it's very important Now at the bottom here. I said I have it written watch this video for extra information And what is that video that's the oh yeah, I think that's the overall I'm under contract video Oops, let's look out of that. Hopefully you couldn't hear that Um, that was a nad So that's the under contract video and what do I attach the buyer client pdf again this it from buyer email number two All the way until the end they are seeing the same pdf because it's it's their whole course, right the buyer the buyer um Uh, the whole overall process so maybe buyer email number two is where they just watch the first couple of videos by email number three So they don't have to keep digging. Oh, yeah, where is that buyer pdf again? They're not gonna have saved it's not their job too So again, you want to make it as easy as possible for them to work with you and give you a great five star review And then at the bottom of the email, of course, I have the way ahead your next to do list email will be your week before closing checklist and I want to go back to the trello So that's um buyer under escrow. I'm going to finish this section here and then Yeah, let me let me finish this section here So as soon as you're under contract tell the lender again this the lender should have already been kept up to date because you have a checklist Where you're talking to the lender and you're telling the buyer to talk to the lender And then you're under contract at this point They're happy. They're excited. Sometimes they're nervous of course with you know, good reason It's probably the most expensive purchase of their life or one of them um Ask for referral. Hey, I'm so happy that like that you're so happy Do you is there anyone else that I can also make happy? Do you know of anyone else looking to buy or sell here in in cert city and um You know that's a great way to get a great time to get referrals If I know a lot of agents do this I I personally don't Uh, but not for any like specific reason. This is also a great way a great time to get Uh, review so a Google review. Hey up until this port up up until this point uh, this is my agent in this city And it's been amazing so far. We're super excited. We just went on a contract. Keep you posted You know, so you cannot you can ask for a review then to With or in lieu of the uh referral So of course you've submitted the offer um, you're making sure that the buyer has Wired the earnest money and you want to talk to the title company make sure that they did that or however your state works If you're looking at a quick close tell the title to rush the haway paperwork that will cost extra of course you have to tell your client that If you are even in an haway area that is a lot of what we had to do in 2022 and Ask them what type of inspections that they want to have in the property. This has already been done You've already sent the under contract now what email Ensure that the seller is going to have uh either a contractor lock box So this is state dependent too. It some states allow that the inspectors can just go there without you without an agent Some states don't so Arizona you have to be there with the inspector So make sure that you know whatever that whichever way it is that it applies um, they're staying in the regs It regulations. Sorry. That was like a military term that I got used to um, so then you confirmed the deposit to the escrow or title You're looking at the title commitment look at who's the seller is the name who you thought it was uh, and you just want to make sure that You're you're you're probably seeing some overlap here too where like this is of course on this on the listing agents responsibility But you also want to make sure Probably even before you place an offer that when you're making an offer who who it's too is actually on the county records of who it own who who owns it So I hope that explained that correct um in in the way that you can understand so at that point you um Confirmed that the lender ordered the appraisal if there is an appraisal you've scheduled the inspections or the TC has And they just let you know um either you're going to be out there or another agent a showing agent can be out there Again state dependent out of tier calendar if you are going to be doing that and Collect the HOA documents if that's applicable remove any contingencies as you're continuing through the transaction The home warranty at that point Do finalize a social media post. Hey like we're under contract. Maybe you could share a real of course no specifics But that you're excited for your client That will generate more more referrals schedule a photo with the clients bring the I have bring the marketing key uh and then at that point you contact the title company and you ask them for The commission instruction form How you want to get paid whether you're picking up a check which I think just don't don't Don't drive to go pick up a check Just like I don't suggest you driving to go to your growth to go to the grocery store to go grocery shopping on Instacart So I I'm just like not a fan. I'm driving. I think it's like really big waste of time unless you're being driven around and able to work in the back seat Uh, but maybe that's just how my brain works So you want to make sure of course when that dude when the inspection period ends Uh, you want to know all the timelines you and your tc should have those dates like memorized and And while actually maybe instead of even memorizing it This is what I do in the title. Would you scroll all the way up on this checklist? I have it Here as as a template for the title pp purchase price close of escrow earnus money do diligence period So that way you know exactly what date it ends who is this for um all of the biggest highlights or if there's some some big to do Uh, you can add it to the title so in that way as you see all of these you know as you continue getting more and more buyers Under contract, you know exactly Where you're at in the process. So let me go back in here Then where was I um, okay If during escrow your client messes up the deal or the client like or the deal falls through on your end Send the cross agent flowers chocolate champagne candy to their office with a card that says Hey Leslie, I'm so sorry about what happened with the transaction You know, even if it wasn't your fault if you worked with them and you liked working with them Send them something of gratitude. It goes such a long way because agents don't really show gratitude to each other So I'm so sorry about what happened with this transaction on 123 L most street I know that you have a backup offer already and you're probably and that you're under contract with another offer But again, I just wanted to say I'm so sorry. Thank you so much for the time that we did work together This goes such a long way even if it was the most terrible actually especially if it was the most terrible transaction At least they realize you're a person you care you spent time out of your day to send them something And it's to their office. So they're like oh man, you got balloons what for oh a transaction that caught on fire like what And they sent you balloons like that's you know, just think about that that that's such a I don't know. I love this. I love this so much um Or like vice versa if the cross agent just goes above and beyond or maybe they don't even need to go above and breathe beyond Send them balloons anyway Send them a little candy like lifesavers candy and card to their office saying how much you want to thank them for saving the deal Or just for being a great cross agent and ask them for their Google business review where or business page where you can review them An agent to agent review. I think goes such such a long way and I love giving agent reviews agents reviews You know, of course if if I work with them because as people are seeing as people are googling agents near them and they see oh this agent has a good reputation amongst other agents That goes a long way so It takes all but a minute of your time Uh, okay, how to find signed documents This is specific again. I hope that you were using a tc to do this. So I'm going to skip over this one Ask the buyer when they want to order the appraisal again. This is already in the checklist It's it's it's redundant for a reason So if there's going to be a post possession post possessions were very very common I'm sure your brokerage has a post possession form if not maybe ask the broker for one um Because they they need to have been told to seek legal counsel because there's a lot of Variations a lot of things that could go wrong. You just want to make sure that you are covered um, and then once the appraisal comes back then if it's at a price or even higher Congratulations, that is a phone call to the buyer saying congratulations Not only you know, did we get the offer in a we got you under contract the price you wanted the terms you wanted But you are getting equity instant equity as soon as you close and this is how much like Because sometimes they'll they'll receive the appraisal, but they don't know how to read it You know, so interpret it for them. Don't be like oh, I had to see that appraisal. Hey congrats like you know You got 15k they might not even know what page tape and find that so of course read it uh baby it as much as you can to them And at the buyer's owner contract on a home with the pool add the again on just a pool Safety notice in case You need that And tell the title company if the buyer is military because a lot of title companies will have Military discounts police or first responder discounts educator discounts Just ask the title companies. What kind of discounts they offer and Make sure that that is applied for the buyer so The binser here this other section is Is an Arizona specific term, but pretty much in Arizona even though it's like it's an as is state when the buyer gets the inspections back They have the option to renegotiate so the seller can so we so we we renegotiate right sometimes say hey Can you actually fix this or that those really pretty major items? Um the the seller can say no So in this case here. I have if the seller decides to reject the buyer's binser That means that the the the form That means that the buyer now has five days to decide whether or not they want to proceed So it's kind of like another just renegotiate period of course that that applies to only Arizona There you might have something similar in your state so That is where I think I'm going to end to days Let me see because the next is going to be the before closing checklist Which is the two weeks out which correlates to email number five that is where I will start it next Um for the next episode If you have any questions again, I am more than happy to reach to talk to you guys about it I am already like super excited with the amount of like people that I've been meeting with and talking them up with these about these checklist Uh similar to to me like Growing the crew. I don't want to just like throw everything at you I want to like talk you through it because trello this is a lot. There is so much on here So again, this is a great way for you to leverage and and continue growing your crew knowing Once you have perfected it say you're the team leader. So you're the broker owner once you have perfected it with your state Your forms that are needed your You know templates in here Um at that point you can just have the agents on your team copy and paste this and you know You can share a board with them and see exactly what they have done and what they haven't done yet So if they're stuck on a on a portion of the transaction Then you can check in say hey, I see that we haven't received their appraisal back Um, you know or whatever it is you're able to see Have better access and seeing what What step of the process each of your agents is at so again if this has been helpful to you at all in the slightest Please give this a uh a like Subscribe to keeping it real on youtube if you're listening to this on apple on Spotify give us a five star review I know DJ does a lot for the community and if you're looking to schedule call to get these checklist Text the word checklist to five two zero three four one two five five two Again, that's five two zero three four one two five five two my name is Ali.
