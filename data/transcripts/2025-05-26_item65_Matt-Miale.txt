[00:01:15] Today's episode is brought to you by corded.io.
[00:01:19] Are you looking for agents to join your brokerage or team?
[00:01:22] Now, as a real estate recruiter, I can tell you the answer is always yes.
[00:01:27] But most agents aren't looking to move right now.
[00:01:30] So how do you know who to contact?
[00:01:32] Well, what if I were to tell you there's a recruiting and retention tool powered by
[00:01:35] artificial intelligence that shows you exactly which agents in your local market are looking
[00:01:41] to leave their brokerage right now and which agents at your own firm are also looking
[00:01:47] to leave you?
[00:01:48] Now, I've been recruiting REALTOR's for 15 years and I've hired over 2000 agents.

[00:02:02] and shows you which agents they believe are likely to move.
[00:02:05] Not only does it do that, but corded's AI went and visited my recruiting website and
[00:02:10] read everything I offer.
[00:02:12] So now when I'm recruiting, corded's AI tells me exactly what to say based on that
[00:02:17] agent's needs and what my brokerage can offer.
[00:02:20] It even writes emails for me.
[00:02:22] I've never seen anything like it and I use it every single day.

[00:02:52] Hello and welcome to another episode of Keeping It Real, the largest podcast made by real estate
[00:02:57] agents and four real estate agents.
[00:03:00] My name is DJ Paris.
[00:03:01] I am your guide and host through the show.
[00:03:03] And just a moment, we're going to be speaking with Matt Miali, who is the largest who has
[00:03:08] the largest real estate team in all of Connecticut.
[00:03:11] He's going to tell you all about how he runs his team and what he teaches to his agents so
[00:03:16] that they can become successful.
[00:03:18] Before we get to Matt, just a couple of quick reminders.
[00:03:20] Oh, this is something you might not know.
[00:03:23] So almost every day, about three, four times a week, I post a 60 second reel on all the
[00:03:29] different social media networks.
[00:03:30] We're talking about Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, LinkedIn, TikTok, probably some others.
[00:03:36] But if you are not following us on social, you should.
[00:03:39] So one probably the easiest way is Instagram.
[00:03:42] Look for top agents, top agent interviews.
[00:03:45] That is our channel top agent interviews.

[00:03:47] You will get a three or four times a week, a 60 second tip that I have called from these
[00:03:53] interviews of exactly what you should be doing right now to grow your business.

[00:04:25] All right, guys, let's get right to it.
[00:04:27] My conversation with Matt Miali.
[00:04:42] What's the best piece of advice you ever heard as an agent?
[00:04:46] Oh, that's a good question.
[00:04:49] That's a really good question.
[00:04:52] If you send a room full of 100 agents, I bet you you could get advice from all of them,
[00:04:56] right?
[00:04:56] Because everybody seems to be an expert at whatever it is that they think that they know.
[00:05:00] But the truth is the best piece of advice that I got actually came a little bit as an
[00:05:07] admonishment.
[00:05:09] Mentor of mine, good friend of mine, a guy that I like to go to with all my bright ideas.
[00:05:16] At one point, sat me down, look me in the eye and said, you know what your problem is, Matt,
[00:05:23] you're never going to stop having good ideas.
[00:05:26] The issue isn't a lack of good ideas.
[00:05:28] Good ideas are a plenty.
[00:05:31] It's the ability to pick the right one for right now.
[00:05:35] And that was really powerful for me because at the end of the day, what that really meant,
[00:05:40] what it meant to me was, and it wasn't even the sort of cliche like, oh, the difference
[00:05:46] is execution.
[00:05:47] Because sure, the difference is execution.
[00:05:48] But you know what, I've executed on a lot of good ideas that wound up not being the
[00:05:53] best thing for me to do at that moment in time.
[00:05:57] It's picking.
[00:05:58] What are you going to do right now that's going to move you the closest to your goal and
[00:06:01] get you the actual outcome that you're after?
[00:06:04] My favorite example of this with real estate agents is how many real estate agents are
[00:06:08] out there, totally committed to their job.
[00:06:10] They're so all in that are like, I'm going to be, this is the year.
[00:06:13] I'm going to do 40 units this year.
[00:06:15] I'm going to hit 20 million this year.
[00:06:16] I'm going to hit all the goals that I set out to hit.
[00:06:19] And then business opportunity pops up or a flip.
[00:06:23] And they just immediately shift and go, you know what, I'm going to flip this house
[00:06:26] instead.
[00:06:27] And to me, it's like, well, maybe that doesn't make it a bad, the flip isn't a bad idea
[00:06:32] in that moment.
[00:06:33] That's not a bad idea.
[00:06:34] Yeah, you might be able to make $1,500, maybe even $200,000.
[00:06:38] But, but is that the right thing right now?
[00:06:41] Is that, is that, are you always ready to just throw away the goal that you had for
[00:06:45] the next new thing?
[00:06:47] And I think that, that, that plagues our industry, particularly agents, that if agents
[00:06:52] would just commit, like commit to, are you going to be the best agent?
[00:06:55] Because you can't be the best agent and also flip 25 houses.
[00:06:59] And also just be ready to throw your goal away at any moment in time.
[00:07:03] And that, that advice, it led me to get super focused on picking the right thing versus
[00:07:11] the wrong thing.
[00:07:12] You hear that in other terms too, where people say like, you have to say a lot more
[00:07:15] knows than you do yeses.
[00:07:17] Like Warren Buffett said that, Charlie Manger said that that.
[00:07:19] They say no to a lot more opportunities than they say yes to.
[00:07:22] I can relate a lot to this because I recruit real estate agents.
[00:07:27] We have 42,000 of them here locally in Chicago and in the surrounding areas.
[00:07:32] And as a result, we have all these funnels for agents to who aren't our agents yet, who
[00:07:38] you know, can come into our, our sphere.
[00:07:41] They, you know, answer, you know, something that we're putting out there.
[00:07:44] And so we have all these different funnels or buckets that they can come into.
[00:07:48] And the moment one comes in, I got really excited.
[00:07:50] And as you said, there's no shortage of bad ideas.
[00:07:53] There's always leads coming in and for at least for what I do.
[00:07:58] And the hard part is not necessarily taking the brand new lead that just popped in
[00:08:02] in lieu of reaching out to the person that I need to reach out to probably 10 more times
[00:08:08] in the next several months.
[00:08:10] It's all the fortunes in the follow up.
[00:08:12] So, you know, very exactly, really exactly what you're saying.
[00:08:14] It's not, but I get excited because that new shiny lead just came in and it's like,
[00:08:17] oh, maybe they'll come over right away.
[00:08:19] They probably won't, but I get excited because it's new.
[00:08:22] And then, you know, I get stuck.
[00:08:23] So, all right.
[00:08:24] So that's a great, great piece of advice.
[00:08:26] I mean, I just think like business is the long game.
[00:08:28] And so just because you can do it doesn't mean you should.
[00:08:31] It doesn't make it the right next thing for you to do.
[00:08:34] And so, you know, for sure, there are some fundamentals that every agent has to do if
[00:08:40] you want to be a full-time agent.
[00:08:41] But it just feels to me.
[00:08:43] And again, it was humbling to get that advice early in my career because it's true.
[00:08:49] What I was waking up every day looking for the next best brightest idea rather than just
[00:08:53] going and doing the one thing that I had already committed to doing consistently over time
[00:08:58] and we'll rebuild something that was sustainable.
[00:09:01] What's the worst piece of advice you've ever received?
[00:09:04] Worst piece of advice.
[00:09:07] Well, I've gotten a lot of bad advice, too.
[00:09:10] But I think the one that pops in my head, or again, early in my career, I was talking to
[00:09:18] an experienced agent, somebody that I looked up to respected and was trying to get some
[00:09:23] guidance around how to work with the particular buyer.
[00:09:25] Now, this was probably one of the first five or six clients that I had.
[00:09:30] So we're talking 2006, 2007, early early in my career.
[00:09:35] And I was showing them properties that the client had requested to go see.
[00:09:41] And the agent just said, oh, don't show that house.
[00:09:45] She pointed to one of them and said, don't show that house.
[00:09:48] And they said, why not?
[00:09:49] And she said, it's a split level.
[00:09:51] Who wants to live in a split?
[00:09:53] And I was like, oh, I didn't know split levels were bad.
[00:09:57] I didn't have any idea that that was a thing, right?
[00:10:00] So I took that advice and called the clients and echoed the sentiment without thinking
[00:10:09] it through, right?
[00:10:10] Without really getting good clarity about what I was about to say.
[00:10:14] And I said, well, this one's a split level.
[00:10:16] So that might not be as desirable.
[00:10:18] And the client said, well, I grew up in a split level.
[00:10:22] And well, fortunately, I was able to recover.
[00:10:25] But why was the worst advice?
[00:10:28] So it wasn't that incident.
[00:10:30] What I learned from it, I learned an amazing, amazing lesson from that.
[00:10:35] It was the worst advice because it presumes.
[00:10:38] It takes a position of presumption that we should never ever have as real estate agents.
[00:10:46] We should never presume to understand what it is that the client wants or needs.
[00:10:50] We should always, always, always be open to letting them guide the process.
[00:10:55] And so it was the worst advice because it came from the worst place.
[00:10:58] It came from this place of judgment and decision making that we really don't earn with our clients
[00:11:04] until they give us permission to do that.
[00:11:06] And in that point, I certainly didn't have the permission.
[00:11:09] I certainly did not the experience.
[00:11:10] And I most definitely did not have, did not have the knowledge base to be making that kind of a judgment.
[00:11:17] I think that's terrible advice.
[00:11:18] I think that we have to work our way through relationship in order to get our clients
[00:11:24] what they want.
[00:11:25] It's not what we think they want.
[00:11:26] It's not what they, we, it's not what their parents think they want.
[00:11:29] It's not what we think they should want.
[00:11:31] It's, it's to get them what they want.
[00:11:32] That's, that's what pure advocacy and, and service is.
[00:11:37] And so I'll never forget that moment.
[00:11:41] It was like, wow, that was really, really terrible advice.
[00:11:43] And driven by the totally the wrong thing.
[00:11:45] So, well, Matt Miali is our guest.

[00:13:05] Thank you.
[00:13:06] That was an awesome intro.
[00:13:07] I love it.
[00:13:08] I love it.
[00:13:08] You've done a lot of awesome things.
[00:13:09] I'm excited to have you on and to share some of the wisdom you've gained as you already
[00:13:15] have in the advice you said earlier to our audience.
[00:13:18] Well, I was like to start at the beginning.
[00:13:20] So tell us how and why you got started at real estate.
[00:13:24] If you haven't heard the story of the reluctant REALTOR, you're about to.
[00:13:29] Hi, you know, my professional career started out in advertising.
[00:13:33] I worked from Boston to LA predominantly in new business and sales for various different
[00:13:41] iterations.
[00:13:42] And you can sort of time stamp it.
[00:13:45] This is early 2000.
[00:13:46] So I did spend a lot of time in the early phases of internet, internet, internet advertising.
[00:13:53] So you know, back in the day when web banners and, you know, pay per click was, was not a
[00:13:58] thing yet.
[00:13:59] It was really just about online advertising through, through digital media.
[00:14:04] And I spent the better part of my first seven or eight years in professional sales selling
[00:14:09] internet advertising.
[00:14:11] I got, I got, I kind of got lucky in finding an opportunity with a, with a company called
[00:14:19] Network Communications Incorporated, which was a publishing company in 2003, 2003.
[00:14:29] I hope to put them, but they published this thing called the real estate book.
[00:14:33] And those agents that have been around since prior to 2010 would know the real estate
[00:14:39] book because it was the most widely published real estate listings magazine in the country.
[00:14:46] Over 10 million copies every four weeks in 700 markets.
[00:14:51] And basically this was the best possible version pre-Zillow pre-reelter.com, pre, you know,
[00:14:59] MLS for consumers to get access to listings.
[00:15:02] It was in a publishing format.
[00:15:03] And so I worked for Network Communications for a couple of years.
[00:15:08] And while doing that, I got exposed to the industry.
[00:15:12] And I had never had an exposure to real estate prior to that.
[00:15:15] I didn't really understand the business, but I spent, you know, the better part of 24 to
[00:15:18] 36 months flying around the country, going into boardrooms, going into brokerage meetings,
[00:15:23] and selling advertising to real estate agents.
[00:15:26] I realized quickly I was much more entrepreneurial than I was as a, you know,
[00:15:33] than I was likely to be a corporate guy.
[00:15:36] And so I made the decision in 2005 that I was going to pursue a career for myself.
[00:15:44] And I didn't quite know whether I was going to go to law school or I was going to go get an MBA
[00:15:48] or whether I didn't really have any clue what my future held.
[00:15:52] Of course, I was, you know, in my late 20s at the time.
[00:15:54] So life was wide open to me.
[00:15:57] But I figured I'd go get a real estate license in the interim just to, just to hold me over.
[00:16:01] I figured that that would be a good way for me to, you know, sort of fill the gaps in between
[00:16:07] this big career that I had and whatever came next.
[00:16:10] And it didn't take very long for me to figure out that like, huh, maybe this is the thing.
[00:16:16] Maybe this thing right here is the thing.
[00:16:19] It took a little while for me to get comfortable with the idea because of course, like a lot
[00:16:23] of people I had ego and, you know, I'd had a title and I put on a suit every day and
[00:16:28] I got to fly on airplanes and go into boardrooms and I felt real important about myself, you
[00:16:33] know, in that job.
[00:16:34] But it didn't pay nearly as well as real estate.
[00:16:37] It was nowhere near as fulfilling.
[00:16:39] I mean, it didn't feel like I was satisfying or serving, you know, my heart in that job
[00:16:44] because there wasn't really any beneficiary.
[00:16:47] You know, it was all ad buys and, you know, cost per, cost per impressions and things like
[00:16:51] that.
[00:16:51] So when I got into real estate, I found a part of me was, was being filled up.
[00:16:57] I was, I was thrilled to work with customers.
[00:16:59] I loved the process.
[00:17:00] I loved the service component of it.
[00:17:02] And I was actually pretty good at it.
[00:17:05] So it came kind of natural.
[00:17:06] So, you know, moving through 2006, I got my license 2007, 2008.
[00:17:13] I'm sort of getting my feet wet.
[00:17:14] I'm still dabbling in other things.
[00:17:16] You know, I'm like doing some consulting.
[00:17:19] I'm still doing some other sales.
[00:17:20] And like 2008, somewhere around May, I'm like, you know what?
[00:17:26] The market's really, I'm going to jump in.
[00:17:28] Full, as possible time to join this business.
[00:17:31] Time to do this.
[00:17:32] And so I burned the boats, blew up the bridges, jumped in with both feet and in November
[00:17:38] and Ron collapsed.
[00:17:40] You know, and so it was wild experience, but the best thing about that.
[00:17:46] And this is really the message for every agent that's out there today,
[00:17:49] suffering through this current climate.
[00:17:51] The best thing about starting in 2008, really committing to being in the business
[00:17:56] is I know any better.
[00:17:57] I did not know any better.
[00:17:59] And so the market conditions of that time were the market conditions that trained me
[00:18:05] that made me the person that is able to get up every day and focus on what matters
[00:18:10] versus what does.
[00:18:11] In fact, then it was a totally different market than we're in now.
[00:18:15] As far as the conditions, it was a short sale, pre-foreclosures.
[00:18:18] You know, distressed inventory market versus now where we're in low inventory
[00:18:23] and a whole bunch of other conditions, again, depending on which market you're in.
[00:18:27] But the job was the same.
[00:18:29] The job was wake up and sign something, sell something or set an appointment.
[00:18:33] That was it.
[00:18:34] Those were the three hallmarks of whether I had a successful day.
[00:18:37] I would look at the calendar and I would say,
[00:18:39] where is an opportunity for me to go sign an agreement?
[00:18:42] Either with a buyer client that's going to hire me or a listing client that's going to hire me.
[00:18:46] Where is there an opportunity for me to take one of my current customers who's already hired me
[00:18:51] and find them a house that they're willing to buy or find somebody who's willing to buy one of the listings that I currently have?
[00:18:57] Or if I can't do either one of those things today,
[00:18:59] I'm just going to go find the next person that I can go sit down with and tell them why I should be the REALTOR that they choose.
[00:19:05] And so sign something, sell something or set an appointment, became my mantra.
[00:19:09] I wrote it every day on the top of a yellow note pad that I worked off of
[00:19:14] because I did everything pre-CRM because I couldn't afford top producer.
[00:19:18] And I figured that all of that technology stuff was more confusing than I needed.
[00:19:22] So I built my entire business out of a spiral notebook,
[00:19:24] just flipping the pages and writing on the top, sign sell set, every single day.
[00:19:29] My objective was never to end the day without doing at least one of those things.
[00:19:32] And so that was the business. That's how I started.
[00:19:36] Yeah, I used to have a, I put it on my desktop on my computer.
[00:19:41] It was basically says no more zero days.
[00:19:43] So even even if I got to the end of the day or close to the end of the day.
[00:19:48] And I have never been a producing agent, but for what I do is I recruit REALTOR.
[00:19:52] So I have a similar kind of thing.
[00:19:54] And I have to kind of do the exact same activities you're talking about.
[00:19:57] And you know, it would it would be like, oh my gosh, like I spent all day on customer service or
[00:20:02] servicing my existing, you know, agents that I'm trying to recruit,
[00:20:05] but I haven't generated any new leads or I haven't closed anyone in a few days.
[00:20:10] And realizing that all three of those, those activities have to be done as best as possible.
[00:20:17] You know, and always remembering that, you know, there's ways to, to hit those.
[00:20:21] There's habits to, to begin to, you know, to hit those.
[00:20:24] And you know, Brian Baphini talks talks a lot about this.
[00:20:27] And I think most of us probably have heard of Brian Baphini.
[00:20:29] I probably listened to him a bit.
[00:20:31] But he's a big fan of that.
[00:20:32] Like, meet two to five people every single day as one of the, you know, sort of,
[00:20:35] you know, getting at least more people in your database.
[00:20:37] And it's like, even if you just did that and nothing else,
[00:20:41] you'd never really be out of business.
[00:20:44] You, you might not be a come a great REALTOR.
[00:20:45] And if you don't, you know, learn the craft and do a really good job,
[00:20:48] you might not be great customer service.
[00:20:49] But if you're meeting people every day, you're going to find new opportunities.
[00:20:53] I mean, I'm so, I'm so passionate about what this industry has done for me and what it can do for
[00:21:00] people. And then equally as frustrated with how people waste the opportunity.
[00:21:06] Like the real estate license might be the greatest gift to somebody with the natural
[00:21:13] service heart of anything out there because you understand that like the simplest
[00:21:19] thing you can do is wake up every day and go help people solve problems.
[00:21:23] And if you happen to have a real estate license and you're the person that helps somebody
[00:21:27] figure out how to get their patio fixed or get a new roof put on or figure out a drainage
[00:21:32] problem or get a plumber to come over and fix that leak that they've got or whatever.
[00:21:37] If you, if you become a professional problem solver in your community and all you do as a job
[00:21:42] as the J.O.B. is make sure that you know lots of people and know how to solve lots of problems.
[00:21:47] Your real estate business will take care of itself.
[00:21:50] You do not need the fancy CRM. You don't need to spend thousands of dollars on
[00:21:55] leads. You don't need to, to live in a dark cold basement with a swinging light bulb over your
[00:22:01] head and cold call for six and a half hours every day. Those things are not necessary.
[00:22:06] But what happens is because agents are unwilling to do the work of engaging the world, which is
[00:22:13] one of our catchphrases, when we say you must engage the world, because the agents are unwilling
[00:22:17] to go and engage the world and talk to the barista and talk to the people and network the community
[00:22:22] and be involved, they wind up defaulting to sitting behind a computer and playing office all day
[00:22:28] and getting far, far worse results. When you really meet top producing agents, what do they all
[00:22:34] have in common? They're out there meeting people. They call people every single time that very rarely
[00:22:42] do you meet. It's a rare case where the top producing agent is like, oh, I'll tell you my system.
[00:22:47] My system is I do, you know, four and a half hours of cold calling every day. Yes, those agents exist
[00:22:53] and there are top producers, but that is actually the edge case, not the norm case. And then what
[00:23:00] happens is we take brand new people and we try to teach them edge case instead of, instead of
[00:23:04] shooting down the middle. And I think that's bananas. I think it's so much of the rhetoric in the
[00:23:09] industry is about like, you know, grinding it out and this hustle culture mindset and like,
[00:23:15] I got to tell you, you can have a lot of fun in this business. You can have a lot of fun. You can
[00:23:23] be a professional problem solver, be the resource for them and your business will take care of
[00:23:27] itself. It will just literally grow all by itself. I had an interview once with a top producing agent
[00:23:35] and he said, you know, this is going to sound funny, but it goes on the only one I know that does this.
[00:23:40] And it's very similar to what you were talking about where he said my, the way I deepen relationships
[00:23:45] with clients and also it's how I get invited to meet new clients through referrals is he said it's
[00:23:52] really not as much about me helping them buy your cell property, which I do. I'm a good, I do a
[00:23:56] good job with that. But he said, I will call them, you know, then there's like seven years in between,
[00:24:00] you know, they're going to use you again. So what do you do? And he said, what I was always doing
[00:24:04] was calling people and he goes, I realized that everyone who owns a home always has an unfinished
[00:24:09] project. Whatever it is could be something super minor, you know, getting some holes replaced in
[00:24:14] the walls where paintings you stop be or could be getting a new roof or whatever, you know,
[00:24:18] and he said, everyone's got something on that to do list that they're just kind of pushing down
[00:24:22] down the, down the, you're kicking down down the field because they're just, you know, they don't
[00:24:26] have time to do it. He said, I would just call and see like, hey, what's, you have any unfinished
[00:24:29] projects right now? I want to help you with that. And he would just go, okay, let's help you take
[00:24:33] the next step. I got the right person for you. Give me, you know, give me a day or two. I'll be,
[00:24:37] and he's like, that's all I did. He's job about solving problems. I was like, that is brilliant.
[00:24:41] And he goes, because everybody's got one. And then he says inevitably, I just get business that way.
[00:24:46] Well, you're, you're, again, you're coming from contribution. You're, you're entering the conversation
[00:24:50] with a thoughtful heart saying, hey, how, how can I help you right now? And people appreciate
[00:24:56] that. And then, you know, maybe every 10 calls or something that's like, yeah, you can help me.
[00:25:00] And oh, by the way, you might be able to help my neighbor too because they were just mentioning
[00:25:04] the other day that they're getting their house ready to sell. And I'm so glad you called.
[00:25:08] It's, it's, again, it's not complicated. I think that we've, we've just, we've just brought so
[00:25:14] much complexity to the industry from the standpoint of how we operate. And what I, what I literally
[00:25:20] think, you know, my, my calling is is to help agents simplify it down to the basics, not to make it
[00:25:26] sound that it's not, not to make it sound like it's, you know, rudimentary because it's not, you
[00:25:31] know, the, the transactions obviously involve a pretty sophisticated level of understanding. And you've
[00:25:37] got to navigate the emotional experience of the client that you're serving. And so there's a whole
[00:25:42] lot of skill that goes into that. But the foundational elements of the J. O. B. The part that's hard
[00:25:48] is the acquisition of new customers. And that part, you know, you just go serve people,
[00:25:53] just go be available to help people. And, and the rest of it's going to work itself out. Now,
[00:25:58] that requires you to engage the world. If you sit in your house waiting for them to show up,
[00:26:01] that's not going to work. It's not going to happen. Yeah. And the worst, the worst part is that
[00:26:06] sometimes it does happen. And that will sort of reinforce this idea that something falls into our
[00:26:11] lap. You know, we get lucky. You get that phone call that you weren't expecting that you didn't
[00:26:16] really earn, but you know, you, whatever, you got lucky. And then you're like, this is how it
[00:26:19] works sometimes. And then you work, yes, the worst thing that can happen to a brand new agent in
[00:26:23] the business is they can stumble themselves into like a $1.2 million listing, you know, by accident
[00:26:28] and be like, this is the greatest thing ever. And it's like, boy, listen, I'm not trying to burst your
[00:26:32] bubble here. But that one didn't, that one did not show up as a result of effort. Like sometimes
[00:26:37] what happens. And then, you know, there is, you will have to deploy effort over time. You will
[00:26:42] have. So let's talk about sort of the conditions of the market right now. They're fairly universal in
[00:26:48] this country. Obviously, there's edge exceptions and other markets that are probably thriving.
[00:26:53] Certainly in Chicago, we're dealing with, I mean, you deal with the entire state of Connecticut.
[00:26:57] So you, you know, a lot more about the East Coast. But for us, we just have a lot, a lack of inventory.
[00:27:04] We have a lot of people, you know, locked into 3% mortgages who don't want to, don't want to move.
[00:27:08] And you can understand that. So we just have a lot fewer listings. And of course, we have buyers
[00:27:13] that are coming in with not a whole lot of inventory. So, and there's people who are, you know,
[00:27:20] pining away for that 3% mortgage that they missed out on as a buyer. And so they're thinking maybe,
[00:27:25] you know, maybe I should wait. And so, you know, there's just a few of those challenges. Plus,
[00:27:29] all the, you know, recent changes in the industry. And certainly the some of the bad publicity.
[00:27:34] I live in Chicago where the headquarters of the National Association of Real Courts are right
[00:27:38] down the street. And, you know, we certainly know that they've had some some bad press. So,
[00:27:43] so there are some some challenges. But there's always opportunity too. So I, I would love to know,
[00:27:50] you know, this kind of harkens back to your trial by fire getting thrown in at really the more
[00:27:54] and more challenging times, probably the most challenging time in recent, you know, history to be a REALTOR.
[00:27:59] And just kind of going, oh, I don't really know that this is as bad as other people know, because in 2005,
[00:28:06] I wasn't practicing when it was a little bit easier. A lot easier. So what, how are you, you've got
[00:28:11] a big team you guys close a home actually several homes almost every single day. What are,
[00:28:17] what are you doing to keep the team motivated to keep the productivity going? Is it the same,
[00:28:22] same activities as always or have you pivoted? So just love to hear that sort of your thoughts there.
[00:28:27] Well, we're for sure pivoted. You know, the thing is is I don't, but I don't think you ever stop pivoting.
[00:28:32] You know, having been in a leadership role now, let's just say for 15 years since I started the team
[00:28:38] in 2010, I mean, it feels like every 12 to 18 months you're pivoting. You're, you're, there's always a new
[00:28:44] market that you need to adapt to and the new market is only new and requires adaptation until everybody gets
[00:28:53] the story. And then once everybody gets the story, everybody goes, oh, okay, these are the rules of the
[00:28:57] game and engage. And then it gets busy again. And then something changes and then people pivot and
[00:29:02] then everybody wants to hold on hold on. What are the rules of the game? Oh, the rules are this ready
[00:29:07] set engage. And so I feel like I've seen that happen a lot. So to address where we're at right now,
[00:29:13] this is no question a skills based market. The agents that are winning right now are agents that are
[00:29:22] practicing our agents that are that are very, very good at the dialogues that they need to have. And
[00:29:29] I don't like using the word script because again, a script sounds like it's, you know, prepared and the
[00:29:34] same every time it's not really what it is, but there are conversations. There are there are moments
[00:29:40] in conversations where you do know that there's an outcome. So let's take the one that you just
[00:29:46] brought up, for instance, you've got a client who's in a 3% mortgage. But living inside of
[00:29:52] a house that no longer suits their needs and saying, well, I have a 3% mortgage. I'm living in a
[00:29:57] house that no longer suits my needs. But I'm willing to sit here and suffer because I don't want to
[00:30:01] participate in a higher mortgage. And so there's a conversation there. There's a there's a crafted
[00:30:07] conversation that you can have with that person that doesn't necessarily. It's not again, it's not
[00:30:13] about convincing them, but at least opens the door to what the realities are between them staying
[00:30:19] versus them going. And I think again, the most experienced agents are practicing those conversations.
[00:30:25] They're practicing what are the right questions to ask. And in order to help expose that potential
[00:30:31] seller to the potential miss the potential opportunity to miss out on additional increasing
[00:30:37] opportunity in the market on the lifestyle that they might live in the house that they actually
[00:30:42] desire. And what is the actual cost of that versus the cost of staying. And so those risk reward
[00:30:49] sort of certainty versus uncertainty dialogues are crucial. But most agents, you know, they're
[00:30:55] again, they're looking for the will tell me what to say. The answer is, well, there is nothing,
[00:31:00] there's nothing to say. There's questions to ask. And then there's information to provide. And then
[00:31:06] outcomes that you can that you can help your customer understand, which will lead them there. So
[00:31:13] another example of this is just sort of like, how do you win in a hyper competitive market,
[00:31:17] like like the market that we're in here in Connecticut, where our inventory is operating at about
[00:31:21] 30% of what we had pre-COVID. I mean, we just don't have houses to sell and we have so many buyers
[00:31:29] who want to buy homes. And how do you help a buyer understand the risk and consequences of
[00:31:37] let's take a real controversial one. Let's really spike the message towards waving a home
[00:31:42] inspection. Sure. Like how do you how do you talk to a buyer about waving a home inspection without
[00:31:48] saying you have to do this or endorsing it, but giving them the freedom to make the decision and
[00:31:54] understand the risk. And I think that that's the difference. I think that what professional agents do
[00:31:59] is they practice that conversation until until they understand exactly what words to say to help
[00:32:06] a customer understand why waving a home inspection might be in their best interest. Even though
[00:32:12] it's not in their best interest and they the two things can actually go excess. You know, so
[00:32:17] exactly. It's an incredible it's a complicated nuanced conversation that professionals can have
[00:32:25] and and and amateur struggle with. And so so that's that's that's how you move people through the
[00:32:32] pipeline. Yeah, you you practice you drill and you know, we're talking about drills and I love
[00:32:38] chat GPT is very helpful for this for you know, you can you know, for $20 a month or maybe even for
[00:32:44] free. I guess you could do it for free as well is you can start talking to your phone and saying,
[00:32:48] hey, imagine, you know, you're a home seller. You've got a 3% mortgage. I'm going to start asking
[00:32:54] questions and I'm going to try to address concerns you might have not to try to persuade you,
[00:32:59] but just keep the conversation going and maybe offer a different perspective. For example, you know,
[00:33:03] another thing to consider, because I'm in that situation where I my home serves me today probably
[00:33:09] won't serve me in a year. And but in a year, if rates come down, I'm going to be competing up against
[00:33:14] a heck of a lot more buyers. So do what I rather compete now, pay a little bit more, maybe,
[00:33:21] then I'd like to or certainly my rates going to be higher than I'd prefer to be but whatever,
[00:33:24] 6.5% I can handle that, but but still not super comfortable. But what I rather compete to
[00:33:31] today's environment versus, you know, a year where maybe rates come down a full point and half.
[00:33:36] Well, then, you know, but the floodgates are open and now the sudden, you know, we might be giving
[00:33:40] away even more. So so there's there and again, not to persuade me to make that decision, but just
[00:33:45] to get me to realize, you know, there are sort of other things to consider and and also just to
[00:33:50] have that conversation about what's most important to you right now, you know, you know, most people
[00:33:55] consider dating the rate, marrying the home and, you know, and that's like, oh yeah, of course,
[00:34:01] you know, it's like nobody nobody wants to buy when when the stock is down either, right? But
[00:34:06] that's the best time, you know, obviously or what I mean, you in the situation, you just outlined,
[00:34:10] you know, for agents that are listening that say, hey, Matt, I encounter this all the time,
[00:34:14] you know, what I would say is the question for you is, well, how long do you expect to be in this
[00:34:18] next house that you're, you know, it's going to be it's going to be a wild. So you're going to
[00:34:24] go seven or eight years and you go, okay, cool. So, you know, over the course of that seven or eight
[00:34:27] years that you're going to be there, do you know, are you anticipating that you're going to get a
[00:34:32] house that you really enjoy and that fulfills needs for your family and like because nobody actually
[00:34:37] wants to transact real estate, that's not why people wake up and call a rilter. They don't say,
[00:34:42] today's the day to buy, that's that's not that's not how it works. It's a life need that they're
[00:34:47] trying to solve for and it's either my house doesn't work for me anymore or my house is too expensive
[00:34:51] or you know, there's a million different conditions that can exist, which would make somebody pick up
[00:34:56] the phone, call a rilter and say, I think now is the time, but a really experienced agent understands
[00:35:01] how to guide a client through the process of discovery that gives them all the options and then
[00:35:07] also, and this is the most important part, a really good advocate also stays detached from the
[00:35:13] outcome in that maybe now's not the right time, but here's what's here's a good news is I'm not
[00:35:17] going anywhere. So when the time is right, you'll call me because I did a good job in helping you
[00:35:22] make a decision and that is the beauty of the business is that you're not actually selling anything,
[00:35:28] you know, that that concept of of like selling houses is just really outdated. It's not what we do
[00:35:34] anymore. You know, we sell our service for sure there is a sale at some point, someone needs to hire
[00:35:40] you and they need to make a decision based on the value proposition that you presented that you're
[00:35:45] the best person to serve their need, but but the houses are relevant, right? Back to that comment
[00:35:49] about the split level, like it doesn't really matter what house the client buys is what's right for
[00:35:55] them. That's the most important piece. Yeah, it's such a great conversation, you know, I was thinking
[00:36:00] if I were a producing agent today and I didn't have, you know, I wasn't swarmed with with my own
[00:36:06] listings and or maybe I'm dealing with a lot fewer listings for my buyers. I might think, okay,
[00:36:12] well, what do I do right now? Well, one thing I could do is I could call everybody in my database and
[00:36:16] say, hey, I'm updating your records and I realize I don't know your three years sort of plan for
[00:36:22] where you currently are, maybe five years. I just would love to know like, what are you thinking
[00:36:26] of moving in in the next few years? Because I need to start thinking about how to get you ready for
[00:36:30] that or or just want to update my my records. You know, it's as simple as that and there you
[00:36:35] all of a sudden you'll find all sorts of maybe not immediate opportunity, but you'll certainly
[00:36:39] have the person go, wow, that's really thoughtful of you. That's that's super kind. You know,
[00:36:43] is the is there is there accountant doing that? Maybe, maybe not. Is there accountant saying, hey,
[00:36:48] let's talk about the next five years? Probably not. Probably saying let's do the test.
[00:36:51] Right now. Yeah, you know, a good financial advisor does that, but you know, even a lot of those people
[00:36:56] don't. So yeah, even a lot of those guys are not practicing the way to have a conversation with
[00:37:03] the client who's, you know, nervous about what's the impact of tariffs going to be on my 401k.
[00:37:09] And, you know, they're not practicing either. So, you know, the differentiation between a pro
[00:37:15] and an amateur is the quality of the conversation. And, and, you know, I appreciate the skill and I
[00:37:23] appreciate the craft of being a professional real estate agent because I know that I put that we
[00:37:30] put the time in on our team to make sure, I mean, literally this morning, our morning call,
[00:37:35] went an hour and 15 minutes as we practiced live, our entire team of 30 full-time professional agents
[00:37:41] practiced live, walking a buyer through offer presentation. Now, you'd think for a team that's
[00:37:47] putting 600 houses under contract in a year that offer preparation and offer presentation would
[00:37:54] be rudimentary, but we don't take that for granted. It's, you know, I look at that like, you know,
[00:37:59] professional football players don't stop practicing throwing and catching, right? They don't stop
[00:38:05] practicing the fundamentals. They don't say, well, we're at the NFL level now. We only throw in the game.
[00:38:11] We only catch in the game. Like, how insane would that be? Like, but that's what agents do. They wait
[00:38:17] for the moment. They wait for the game moment to practice, but that's, that's just not how we operate.
[00:38:22] So, my advice to agents that are out there and so I know agents really often don't like the idea
[00:38:28] of practice. They feel weird. You know, you got to have fun with it. It's practice. It's fun. It's like,
[00:38:33] this is, this is where you should mess up and laugh and joke and say stupid things and then be like,
[00:38:38] all right, let me try that again. Practice, practice the conversations because there are outcomes
[00:38:43] that your clients are really waiting for. They want you to help them. That's what they're there for.
[00:38:47] They're looking for help around us. That is a very, very wise statement that the quality of conversations
[00:38:53] is really what differentiates the top from from everyone else. And that is absolutely true.
[00:39:00] And it's true in my business and in my recruiting business as well because there's lots of recruiters,
[00:39:04] there's lots of great firms out there. And, you know, one firm to another, yeah, there's slight
[00:39:08] differences, you know, between, you know, Keller and Coldwell and, you know, RE/MAX and it's
[00:39:14] sent to 21. They're a Berkshire. They're all good companies. They all have great stuff. And it's
[00:39:19] a more of, and you know, splits are kind of, you know, wherever they are. But the reality of it is,
[00:39:23] it's about having the, you know, the best conversations and knowing sort of how to continue those
[00:39:27] conversations. Oh, versus, hey, are you naive? Are you thinking of moving your firm? Oh, you should
[00:39:31] talk me because, of course, hey, that's great. What that happens. But, but it's more about, hey,
[00:39:36] let's, let's talk about your plan. You know, where do you want to be in the next three to five years?
[00:39:40] You know, how is your brokerage helping you do that or not? And so I use that a lot and I need,
[00:39:45] but do I practice it a lot? No. And that is a great reminder for me and probably everyone to think
[00:39:51] about, do we have a drill partner? Do we have somebody that we can actually role play with and
[00:39:56] throw really tough objections? And not objections so that you can overcome and win the business as
[00:40:01] Matt says, you know, that's, that's not really the point. But just being able to, to, to absorb
[00:40:06] that question, to not let it throw you off your game and to have an answer, to have an actual
[00:40:11] answer that's authentic and true and not to, you know, and again, it's a little scary. You do have
[00:40:17] to humble yourself a little bit to drill. And it reminds me of that great, it's one of my favorite
[00:40:22] sayings. It's before enlightenment, chop wood, carry water, after enlightenment, shop wood, carry
[00:40:27] water. I just got to keep drilling. Well, you know, as long as you're going to be in the business
[00:40:33] and you started this out by saying, you know, do you pivot? And yes, you pivot. I mean, the
[00:40:38] conversations I'm having today are markedly different than the conversations I had three years
[00:40:43] ago. And significantly different than the conversations I had five years ago, pre-COVID,
[00:40:48] or at the beginning of the pandemic, what kind of conversations that I have to have with a
[00:40:52] seller about about the long-term impact of what was happening in the world. And, you know, the quality
[00:40:58] of those conversations determines are those clients for life. Did they feel they got good guidance
[00:41:03] and counsel from you at a time when they needed it? And if all you're looking for is the transaction,
[00:41:09] if you're a hammer and everybody's in nail, you're going to get lucky a couple times,
[00:41:13] because there's going to be some people that are going to show up and say, like, hey, I'm a nail,
[00:41:17] you want to sell me right place. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. That's going to happen.
[00:41:19] And there's lots of those agents out there. And you know what, they sell three to four houses a year.
[00:41:25] And they don't get referral and repeat business where, you know, the average agent on our team
[00:41:29] is selling 30 to 40 homes a year. And our business is 80% repeat, sphere, and referral business.
[00:41:37] That's who we are. Why? Because we practice the conversations we have. We are full-time professional
[00:41:43] agents that go into the marketplace with a desire to serve. And yes, sell houses too. But first,
[00:41:51] we sell problems. That's what we do first. Yeah. It's that givers get mentality. I want to talk about
[00:41:57] events. I know your team is, and you particularly are very passionate about creating value-based events.
[00:42:05] And so you've created a service all around that. But tell us about sort of your philosophy around
[00:42:10] client events and what you've seen the most effective. Well, this is, it's such a great segue,
[00:42:17] because it really does speak to the philosophy that I bring to the business, which is that,
[00:42:21] you know, early in my career, I was taught that script. Matt, call everyone you know, and say hi,
[00:42:27] and then ask them, who do you know that wants to buy sale or invest in real estate? And it didn't
[00:42:33] feel right then. And then when I did it a few times, I was like, this is really awful. It does,
[00:42:39] it's not aligned with what I'm really interested in doing. It doesn't feel anything like the professional
[00:42:45] sales jobs that I used to have, which had this needs analysis and custom, you know, custom designed
[00:42:50] solution. It feels incredibly vapid. And so I think that there's a better way. That said, you do
[00:43:00] have to lead generation. Lead generation is a huge part of what you have to do every day. So,
[00:43:04] it was a moment in my career. It was pretty early on, I would say 2009, where I was starting to
[00:43:11] have some early success. Maybe I had, you know, sold, I think in 2009, I sold maybe 50 houses.
[00:43:17] You know, as more or less a solo agent, I think I had some like transaction support, but nothing
[00:43:21] is for the way. Great. What's your third year? That's a pretty good third year. Third year short sale
[00:43:27] school or I mean, I probably at all times had 15 to 20 short sales listed. I didn't have any like
[00:43:33] REO relationships. I just hustled for people that needed help. Like I was door, I was looking for
[00:43:38] people that needed help. And so when I found them, I would list their properties and then I was
[00:43:42] serving. So I had a great, great sort of business sort of early, early business getting going.
[00:43:48] And I realized that I was doing what a lot of agents do because fundamentally I like people.
[00:43:55] I mean, that's a core part of my personality. I like people. But I was doing a terrible job
[00:44:00] at keeping in touch with all these people. You know, there was just so many of them and it was
[00:44:04] really hard to stay in in relationship. I want to reframe this too for the younger listeners.
[00:44:10] You know, 2010, we weren't texting a lot. This was like, you know, we were two, three years into
[00:44:19] the cell phone, smart phone thing, 2007 the iPhone came out. Texting wasn't really yet a primary
[00:44:29] mechanism for communication. And I don't really think, I mean, Facebook was what 2009, 10,
[00:44:35] something like that. So, you know, we're still operating like probably faxing shit.
[00:44:40] Like I was probably still faxing offers to every third agent, you know. So,
[00:44:46] communication was a little more challenging. So I was out one night after a softball game with one
[00:44:52] of my buddies. And we were talking and he also owned a business, a construction business. And we
[00:44:57] were talking about ways that we've successfully gone and gotten new clients. And he just made this
[00:45:03] comment because this was a bar that had 86 craft beers on tap. And at the time, I was,
[00:45:11] I was kind of into that. And he just made this kind of comment like, it's just too bad you can't
[00:45:17] try them all. And it immediately, like some combination of the conversation we were having about
[00:45:22] business building and trying 86 beers. I was like, but what if you could? What if I had a beer
[00:45:28] tasting? What if I invited all these people that I've served that are part of my community that
[00:45:33] I'm building around my real estate business to come to a beer tasting? I wonder if I could do that.
[00:45:39] And so I reached out to the manager of that bar the next day and I said, hey, what would it cost me
[00:45:43] to rent out the bar for a night? And if I did that, could I do like 12 two ounce samplers for each,
[00:45:51] for each, you know, for everybody that comes in or maybe it was maybe it was 20, it was like 36
[00:45:56] ounces of beer, something like like three beers, you know, could I do that for everybody?
[00:46:01] And could I do like a, you know, like a Bavarian food thing sometime in November and we came up with
[00:46:08] I came up with this concept called harvest vest. And it was my very first event. I was sweating bullets
[00:46:13] because the price of the game was $8,800. So it was giving me $800 bucks for me to have 100 people
[00:46:19] so it was $88 bucks ahead. I was totally, totally stressed because I was like, that was at a time
[00:46:26] when like $800 bucks was like a lot of money. I needed that money in order to like pay my own bills
[00:46:31] the next month. Sure. But I was like, well, but I feel like if I can get all 100 people in this room,
[00:46:38] I can probably get some business from it. And it'll help me move the, move the relationships
[00:46:45] forward. So, so I created the event came up with it. I had a fantastic assistant at the time who
[00:46:51] helped us organize it. And we put the event together and that what that night, that night of the
[00:46:57] event. I'm sweating bullets because I'm like, it's a lot of money. Yeah.
[00:47:00] Rear of the people that I had invited that at RSVP came with a friend that they had an RSVP for.
[00:47:07] And they came in and they immediately apologized. Matt, this is so cool. I'm so sorry, but I brought
[00:47:14] my friend Joe. He has to meet you. He wants to buy a house. Matt, I'm so sorry. I brought my friend
[00:47:21] Sally. Sally, I know she's not invited and you want to start it, but Sally needs to get her house
[00:47:27] on the market right away. Like immediately three people showed up that night that became my client.
[00:47:33] And I'm like, this is it. This is it. I never asked anybody for referrals. None of the conversations
[00:47:39] leading up to the event or the invitation had anything to do with real estate. It was nothing
[00:47:43] more than come join me for a beer tasting to thank you for all your support as I've gotten my
[00:47:48] real estate business up and going. And Harvest Fest became an annual event that we did every year.
[00:47:53] We did it for 10 years from 2010 to 2020 or 2010 to 2019. So maybe nine years we did it because
[00:48:01] 20 we canceled because of COVID. And so that was an annual event. And what I learned from that was
[00:48:08] that the event itself was the least important part. The most important part was the opportunity
[00:48:14] to stay in deep relationships with lots of people over a period of time was to create something
[00:48:18] memorable that put you into an environment that went beyond just REALTOR and into like call it
[00:48:25] friend zone like hey, we're more than just it's more than professional. It was something that was
[00:48:31] in alignment with me personally because I liked to drink beer. So it wasn't unusual for me to be
[00:48:36] in a bar drinking good beer. And so all of those things created authenticity alignment and a great
[00:48:43] opportunity for me to stay in touch with people. And the business just grew. And then we said well,
[00:48:49] what kind of events also work like that. And then as the team grew, we built bigger and bigger events
[00:48:55] to the point now where we do eight to 12 VIP client events every year and getaways. Our biggest
[00:49:01] event we do 15 we typically get about 1500 people at a minor league ballpark here in Hartford
[00:49:06] the Hartford yard goats. We invite like 4,000 people to that event. The invitations are all personal
[00:49:13] invitations. This is not a blood email blast. We call them. We text them. We ask them if they can
[00:49:20] join us because what's most important is the relationship building up. And the events as a part
[00:49:26] of your business can be the greatest lead generator of all time. That the piece that really struck me
[00:49:32] and sunk this for me was the ratio 100 to 1 compared to the ratio 12 to 2. And they teach this in
[00:49:40] the red book, the millionaire real estate agent book written by Gary Keller. They teach that you
[00:49:44] know after years of study what they understood was that if you have 12 people, every 12 people that
[00:49:51] you have that you communicate value to over a period of a year and you give some form of consistent
[00:49:57] communication to not spam by the way. Spam doesn't count. That's not value. That's garbage. Not your
[00:50:03] email newsletter. No, not your email newsletter. You got to communicate value to them over the course
[00:50:08] of a period of a year. For every 12 people, there are two opportunities. So that means for every 250
[00:50:15] people, there are 40 opportunities. So if you have 250 people in a sphere database, that means that
[00:50:22] they know you, you know them. This is not a database like phone email. This isn't just a collection of
[00:50:27] names. This isn't a phone book. These are people that know you. If they see you in the grocery store,
[00:50:31] they say hi. DJ did to see you, right? They say hello. 250 people will create 40 opportunities,
[00:50:36] 40 at that. So it doesn't mean you'll get a closing, but 40 opportunities for every 250 people.
[00:50:43] Wow, what a great business. That's not that many, right? Versus the ratio of paper click
[00:50:51] internet ads or strangers or cold calling or circle prospecting or door knocking. The ratio
[00:50:59] being 100 to one. So I just thought of that and said, so every time I go out, I should always invite
[00:51:07] 12 people. Because if I go out to dinner and I can get a table of 12, there's a high probability
[00:51:12] that there's two people at that table that have some real estate need or know somebody who has a real
[00:51:17] estate need. And you know, I test it all the time and it always finds up true. There's always somebody
[00:51:22] in a small group like that that has something on their radar and maybe not now, but sometime in
[00:51:26] the near future. So a sphere driven business that's backed up by events and giveaways can be a very,
[00:51:32] very powerful tool and way for you to, I call it just kind of hack your lead generation in a way
[00:51:40] that makes the business a lot more fun. Because it's a lot more fun to go to a beer tasting than
[00:51:45] to sit in a room for four hours and cold call. Yeah. And boy, that makes all the sense in the world.
[00:51:52] I love that. And plus there's there's a consistency to it that the clients grow to expect in a good way.
[00:52:00] Look forward to this better way to say it. We would always give away these custom pint glasses.
[00:52:06] And I would for years, I still to this day get them. It's been five years since we did harvest
[00:52:10] fast. I'll get a picture texted to me of a pint glass full of beer with somebody saying,
[00:52:17] drinking out of my favorite pint glass, or I'll get a picture of a collection because somebody made
[00:52:21] six out of the 10 years, you know, like we had our we had our fans for harvest fast. So
[00:52:27] let's let's pivot just briefly to talk a little bit about, you know, right now there's a flight
[00:52:34] for a lot of solo agents into teams or the idea of creating a team, you know, we're seeing a lot
[00:52:40] of value in well, potential value, we'll say, and joining forces, you have a team. You know, when
[00:52:47] somebody, I guess we'll maybe start with people looking to join a team because of and we should
[00:52:51] also mention if you are in anywhere in Connecticut and you are not getting the attention, you feel you
[00:52:57] you need or you're not getting the assistance that you want from your current brokerage or your
[00:53:02] current team lead reach out to Matt and his team. He he is very picky about who he selects because
[00:53:08] of course they're high producing, but he would love to chat with you and see if there's some
[00:53:11] synergy there. So you can reach out to him. We'll have his info in our show notes and he's easy
[00:53:16] to find just Google them, but Matt, let's talk about individual agents that are going, hmm, should I
[00:53:22] join a team? What are your some of your thoughts? Well, I think fundamentally it's a philosophy.
[00:53:28] I think it starts with a philosophy and it is the classic and this is cliche, but it's a cliche
[00:53:34] for a reason because it's true. Teams operate really well with people who like to collaborate,
[00:53:41] okay, and there are two different types of people. There are people who really enjoy collaboration
[00:53:45] and winning together and there are people who really just want to go it alone and kind of don't
[00:53:50] leave me alone. Let me do my thing. If you're a collaborator, if you're a person that desires that,
[00:53:56] a team can be a great a great environment for you. There are two things that people really
[00:54:01] struggle with when they're an independent producer and they're asking the question, should I join a team?
[00:54:10] There's always two. One is this one because obviously if you're partnering with a team,
[00:54:16] the team has to get paid. So there's a there's a there's a different economic model.
[00:54:21] That's the first one. The other one is always identity, which is, you know, or ego around the
[00:54:26] brand, but what about me and my name? The ego identity one is much easier to explain because at the end
[00:54:33] of the day, the client doesn't care about the team anymore than they care about the brokers.
[00:54:37] They're in a relationship with you, the agent. Nobody cares where you work or who you work for.
[00:54:42] The team is the team is nothing more than support and and built in super efficient leverage. A really
[00:54:49] good team should be to a top producing single eight solo agent or top producing solo agent should
[00:54:55] look at a team like outsourced already built ready to run leverage. Like you can build your own car
[00:55:02] or you can buy one and drive it. You're going to pay to just go to the car lot and buy a car that runs
[00:55:10] but a really good team should be able to provide you a car that's just going to run. And by the way,
[00:55:15] really good team should be the should you should be able to pull that car over when it needs new tires
[00:55:19] and you're just going to put it on and say, hey, go go hit the road again. Someone's there to help you.
[00:55:23] Yeah, they're going to top it off with gas. They're going to they're going to you know, they're going
[00:55:26] to create it. And I always said that I think that what what you know, and it give Gary Critt Keller a
[00:55:31] lot of credit. Gary wrote the red book at a time where he looked at the industry and said, what
[00:55:36] makes this industry a business? And he did a great job of articulating that. And I see that like he
[00:55:43] wrote the map. Like he he was like Lewis and Clark to the real estate. And he said, here's a map.
[00:55:49] Here's a roadmap on how to build a high functioning, you know, organization. It's not the only way to do
[00:55:54] it, but he wrote a map like just like Lewis and Clark only took one path to the what, but there was
[00:55:58] lots of different ways to go, but he he wrote it and he he memorialized it and he became you know,
[00:56:02] he got famous for it, right? And I think what real estate teams did is they said, cool, now there's
[00:56:07] lots of these agents out there that have a map. But what we've learned is most of these agents are not
[00:56:11] great at building cars. Like they're really, really good. They can read the map, but then they put
[00:56:17] together a car and they've got different size wheels and hoods one color and the steering wheel and
[00:56:23] they're patching together, you know, pieces of engine parts. And it's like they're not great mechanics
[00:56:27] or automakers. Oh, it's a totally different skill set. It's totally different skill set, right? And
[00:56:32] so the team good teams, I always think of ourselves as like we are we are the auto dealer. Like we're
[00:56:38] we're we're agents go because they're like, I understand the map and I really want to go far.
[00:56:44] But I feel like it's going to take me a really long time to learn how to build this car thing
[00:56:48] that I should drive in. Currently riding a horse, but it looks like you've got a couple of cars
[00:56:54] that I could run in and we say, yeah, we have a couple cars. You could jump right in and start
[00:56:58] driving. Here's what our economic relationship looks like. Now the thing is is like how much
[00:57:03] farther can you go in a car versus a horse? And so when you start to actually look at the economics
[00:57:09] of, you know, what does an average agent do when they're on their own? Again, we're talking about
[00:57:13] average. What do the average agents do when they're on their own versus what do the average agents do
[00:57:17] when they're on a team? Well, the average agent on our team is doing 35 to 40 deals a year. That's
[00:57:22] six times the national average. So like, what are the odds that you're going to do six times the
[00:57:28] national average without driving a car? You can do it yourself. You just have to build your own car.
[00:57:35] So I'm a firm believer in teams. I'm a firm believer even though what also needs to be said is that
[00:57:44] agents need to also understand that many team leads are making no money too. Like they,
[00:57:48] they're, they're, it's, it's not some like, you know, line your pockets cash machine. Yeah.
[00:57:53] It's an incredibly difficult thing to take on. And, and agents that, in teams that do it really well,
[00:58:00] they honor their profit because they understand that in order to run an effective business,
[00:58:03] you have to be profitable. They honor the production because they understand that in order to have
[00:58:08] profit, you've got to have people that have all the tools and resources they need in order to
[00:58:11] go sell. They honor their growth because they know that agents that join a team aren't going to
[00:58:16] stick around very long if they're not growing and having new and bigger better opportunities.
[00:58:20] And they honor their culture because nobody wants to be in a locker room where everybody,
[00:58:24] you know, pissed off and upset. So, so a good team runs by those four pillars and agents that
[00:58:30] are collaborators by nature should be able to walk into, you know, we call it a winning locker room
[00:58:36] experience. And they should feel it right away. They should feel like these are my people. I totally
[00:58:41] get it. And I see how I make more money here. And then, and then the outcome should be should be,
[00:58:47] you know, then it's up to the team lead to deliver the outcome. Yeah. No, that's, that's great. So,
[00:58:52] and I too, I also just want to just quickly touch on those of us that think joining a team will
[00:58:57] solve my lead problems. And there are teams that will dangle a carrot that looks like that. And
[00:59:04] maybe they can deliver on that promise. But what we're talking about is whether that's a good idea
[00:59:10] to for for an agent to look for that solution from that team. I'm sure you get this all the time.
[00:59:16] Yeah. I know I get it as a recruiter. People are like, tell me about what leads you provide.
[00:59:21] I think it's, it's a, you know, to me, it's a huge tell when an agent says that they're in it for
[00:59:26] the leads. 100%. It's a tell that they're not really, they're not really a practitioner at the level
[00:59:32] of the business that we look for. And that they're always going to be at the mercy of external factors
[00:59:38] instead of instead of just doing the work. Now leads can take a mediocre producer and turn them
[00:59:45] into an average producer. Leeds can take an average producer and turn them into an above average producer.
[00:59:51] But leads cannot take somebody who can't do the business and turn them into somebody who can.
[00:59:56] And so, you know, leads are what we, we often think of leads as like the icing on the cake. They're
[01:00:08] the thing, the thing is is remember, if your business is completely built around the idea that
[01:00:13] someone else has to do something first, you're inside of a supply chain that you have no control over.
[01:00:19] You might as well be an employee at that point. Yeah, you, you are an employee, right? You're just
[01:00:22] paying, you're just paying to go to work instead of instead of them paying you. You're actually
[01:00:26] paying to show up. So I, I mean, we, we as a team as a philosophy, of course, because we have
[01:00:33] market share, we get tons of leads. Of course, because we've been in the business for years,
[01:00:36] we get tons of leads. Of course, because we have a database that we communicate lots to,
[01:00:40] we get lots of leads. So we have lots of inbound leads, but as a, as a product of our value
[01:00:45] proposition, it never comes up. And we're talking to an agent that's interested in joining a high
[01:00:49] performing team where the average agent is making a lot of money succeeding at a high level,
[01:00:55] you know, on the leaderboard every month. When they ask about leads, we say, yeah, they're here,
[01:01:00] but that's, that's literally not even close to the reason you should be here. You should be here,
[01:01:05] because you want to win championships and you want to be in the winning locker room. And so,
[01:01:09] you know, it's, it's, that you can, again, it's, it's a disqualifier if somebody's looking for
[01:01:15] 100%. Because we have them and we get tons of them, but, and we give them to our producers. It's,
[01:01:19] we operate on a merit app. You're a business. Of course, you give them to the people most likely to close.
[01:01:24] Well, that's also something that I've always found kind of interesting, like, because I've had
[01:01:27] agents come to me in the past and be like, you know, hey, I'm getting recruited and the person said
[01:01:31] they'd give me leads. And I go, that's cool. How do you feel about the idea that they'll give you
[01:01:35] leads, but not give leads to their top producers that are already on their team? What's that mean for
[01:01:40] you once you're in the door? And they're like, oh, that's interesting. And I'm like, well, you know,
[01:01:44] again, what, what, what's that do? Like why would they've had eight, those people have had agents on
[01:01:49] their team four or five, six years. And they're going to give leads to you. That's weird to me. Like,
[01:01:55] that doesn't, that's, that's just culturally doesn't sound good. I don't want to be in that environment.
[01:01:59] From a business perspective, it doesn't sound like a smart play because, you know, you, you know,
[01:02:03] Zillow has their flex program. They don't want to give those, those are the leads that you pay on
[01:02:07] the back end, not front. And, you know, they're going to be really picky about who gets those leads
[01:02:12] because the end of the day, they need those leads closed. And, you know, bringing on a new person
[01:02:16] is a bit of an unknown. And you're right. It's, it's certainly an enticing character, Dangle,
[01:02:22] in front of somebody. But if you really think about it, like, you know, first of all, firm never has
[01:02:28] too many leads. It's never, oh, we have so many leads. We need to bring in some new people,
[01:02:32] you know, maybe I guess that's possible. But it's very unlikely. And again, why are they not giving
[01:02:36] those to the people that are most likely to close that they have, you know, assurance because they
[01:02:41] work or they're, yeah, that's a, that is, and if that's part of the recruiting strategy,
[01:02:46] then that's going to continue to be part of their recruiting strategy. You know, what we,
[01:02:49] we really live by that philosophy of, you know, the teacher man to fish versus give a man to fish.
[01:02:53] And the, the concept is we can teach somebody how to lead generate, like we're actually really,
[01:02:59] really good at that. And the reason we're good at it is because we have this built-in infrastructure
[01:03:04] around events and giveaways and database management that allows an agent to show up here. Again,
[01:03:09] we have a race car and we allow an agent to show up here and kind of hand over all their tools
[01:03:13] and parts. And we say, cool, we're going to build you a car. And then you just have to learn how to
[01:03:17] be a great driver. I just, I need you to be a fantastic driver. I need you to be the best driver
[01:03:22] ever. I need you to drive the track all day. I need you to learn that return. I need you to learn
[01:03:26] the speeds to take it at. I need you to be the best driver you can possibly be. Stop worrying about
[01:03:30] the car. I'll take care of the tires. I'll take care of the hood. I'll take care of the rest of it.
[01:03:35] We'll make sure the gas is always topped off. We'll make sure the oil's changed. You just learn
[01:03:38] to be a great driver. And most agents are like, thank God. Yeah. Because all I really wanted to do
[01:03:45] is drive anyway. Yeah. I really want to be a mechanic. And, and you find yourself in it. And by the
[01:03:50] way, like this speaks to something else you said earlier, like, I think the industry does a huge
[01:03:55] disservice to a lot of agents by giving them tons of distraction points. Like we're the, we're
[01:04:02] low hanging fruit for separating from our money because because agents are looking for a shortcut
[01:04:08] and they don't really understand. I'm going to use the car analogy again. They don't really understand
[01:04:12] how the car works. And so if you don't understand how the car works and somebody's selling you a
[01:04:16] flux capacitor, you go like, Oh, do I need that? And they're like, if you want a time travel, you do.
[01:04:22] Well, awesome. You know, give that to, I did forget that they need 1.21 gigawatts from a
[01:04:27] lightning bolt in order to make the thing work. So they're out there buying flux capacitors, putting
[01:04:31] them in their car. And they don't even know what they do. And you know, whether that's some advanced
[01:04:35] CRM system or lead generation system or out, you know, outsourced ISA system, all of it is,
[01:04:41] oh, it's too much money for, for what you're spending. You just need to do the job. And if you did
[01:04:47] the job, you don't have to spend all that money. You can actually have a profit and have a fantastic
[01:04:51] fulfilling life, by the way. Yeah, it's almost keeping those blinders on and just doing, going back to
[01:04:58] fundamentals, you know, the things that we know are tried and tested and true. And yeah, maybe they're
[01:05:03] not super sexy or fun. And you know, doing pushups isn't fun. And I have to do those too. And much
[01:05:11] is I don't want to have to do a pushup ever again or squat. But we'll say I pushups I can, I can
[01:05:15] handle squats, you know, to me are just not my favorite. Well, it's really good idea. It's a really
[01:05:21] good idea to just squats. Even if you have good form, by the way, only if you have good form. But
[01:05:27] the point is is you have to do sort of the things that that we know are going to get the ball down
[01:05:31] the field. And in this, you know, in this business, it is relationship building. You've said it.
[01:05:35] And we didn't even get to a third of the topics that I wanted to cover. But Matt is a super,
[01:05:40] super busy guys team is crushing, closing the two deals a day, you know, on average, which is
[01:05:46] incredible in in this market. And so I want everybody to do a couple of things. One, I want you to
[01:05:52] check out Matt's podcast, which is the real estate MD, you know, he's diagnosing problems. He's
[01:05:58] doing live coaching on his show. It's how cool is that. I have something I do very similar. I'm not
[01:06:03] the coach, however, but I have found that to be really fun. And if you, you know, again, one
[01:06:09] agent's challenges is every agent's challenge. So even if you're you go to his podcast and you hear
[01:06:15] something, you're like, well, I'm not currently dealing with that. You will be soon or you will at
[01:06:18] some point. So hearing that, you know, even just hearing somebody else's challenges get solved or
[01:06:23] get worked on will help you, you know, or you'll get some wisdom. So definitely check out real estate
[01:06:27] MD. We will have a link to that in the show notes. And also I want you to continue to support Matt.
[01:06:35] Check out his website, the MiaoLi team. If you are it, well, two opportunities here. If you're an
[01:06:39] agent in the Connecticut area, reach out. You've been looking for a team to join a high performing
[01:06:44] team. Matt has all sorts of wonderful programs that he's built. And again, building that car for
[01:06:50] you, teaching how to operate that car. That's his his job. And you're going to get going and run that
[01:06:55] and get some pretty amazing results. His his track record speaks for himself. His team is is
[01:07:01] unbelievable. So if you're in the Connecticut area and Matt, you are expanding. Do you want to share
[01:07:05] a little bit about, you know, where we're some of our listeners who maybe aren't in the Connecticut area?
[01:07:09] Yeah, we're we are already in Massachusetts operating in in Southern Massachusetts,
[01:07:16] Long Meadow Aguom Springfield area. We are expanding into Putnam in Westchester County in New York.
[01:07:22] And we're actively in the process of looking for partners in Rhode Island. And and you know,
[01:07:29] our expansion to I love to just it's you know, it's a long story, but I love to talk a little bit
[01:07:34] about this only because it is and has always been my philosophy to do it right, not rushed. And so
[01:07:40] we are looking for the right partners that want to follow the playbook that's got proven results
[01:07:45] and that are looking to win at the level that we're winning at. And so it's always right, not rushed.
[01:07:51] It's fine. The right people and then the results follow. We'll reach out to Matt if you are
[01:07:56] interested in either becoming a partner with Matt or becoming, you know, part of his team or if
[01:08:02] you're an agent, totally different part of the country who doesn't service the area, Matt services,
[01:08:06] but have clients that move to and from those areas that Matt mentioned, you know, he needs a
[01:08:11] referral partners as well. And he has people that move out of his area and he needs to send those
[01:08:15] leads along the way. So, you know, what a great team to get in contact with. So reach out to him,
[01:08:19] see if you guys have some synergy and can connect and, you know, help each other. Also, on behalf of

We take your suggestions and then we modify a show to better meet your needs. All right, guys, let's get right to it. My conversation with Matt Miali. What's the best piece of advice you ever heard as an agent? Oh, that's a good question. That's a really good question. If you send a room full of 100 agents, I bet you you could get advice from all of them, right? Because everybody seems to be an expert at whatever it is that they think that they know. But the truth is the best piece of advice that I got actually came a little bit as an admonishment. Mentor of mine, good friend of mine, a guy that I like to go to with all my bright ideas. At one point, sat me down, look me in the eye and said, you know what your problem is, Matt, you're never going to stop having good ideas. The issue isn't a lack of good ideas. Good ideas are a plenty. It's the ability to pick the right one for right now. And that was really powerful for me because at the end of the day, what that really meant, what it meant to me was, and it wasn't even the sort of cliche like, oh, the difference is execution. Because sure, the difference is execution. But you know what, I've executed on a lot of good ideas that wound up not being the best thing for me to do at that moment in time. It's picking. What are you going to do right now that's going to move you the closest to your goal and get you the actual outcome that you're after? My favorite example of this with real estate agents is how many real estate agents are out there, totally committed to their job. They're so all in that are like, I'm going to be, this is the year. I'm going to do 40 units this year. I'm going to hit 20 million this year. I'm going to hit all the goals that I set out to hit. And then business opportunity pops up or a flip. And they just immediately shift and go, you know what, I'm going to flip this house instead. And to me, it's like, well, maybe that doesn't make it a bad, the flip isn't a bad idea in that moment. That's not a bad idea. Yeah, you might be able to make $1,500, maybe even $200,000. But, but is that the right thing right now? Is that, is that, are you always ready to just throw away the goal that you had for the next new thing? And I think that, that, that plagues our industry, particularly agents, that if agents would just commit, like commit to, are you going to be the best agent? Because you can't be the best agent and also flip 25 houses. And also just be ready to throw your goal away at any moment in time. And that, that advice, it led me to get super focused on picking the right thing versus the wrong thing. You hear that in other terms too, where people say like, you have to say a lot more knows than you do yeses. Like Warren Buffett said that, Charlie Manger said that that. They say no to a lot more opportunities than they say yes to. I can relate a lot to this because I recruit real estate agents. We have 42,000 of them here locally in Chicago and in the surrounding areas. And as a result, we have all these funnels for agents to who aren't our agents yet, who you know, can come into our, our sphere. They, you know, answer, you know, something that we're putting out there. And so we have all these different funnels or buckets that they can come into. And the moment one comes in, I got really excited. And as you said, there's no shortage of bad ideas. There's always leads coming in and for at least for what I do. And the hard part is not necessarily taking the brand new lead that just popped in in lieu of reaching out to the person that I need to reach out to probably 10 more times in the next several months. It's all the fortunes in the follow up. So, you know, very exactly, really exactly what you're saying. It's not, but I get excited because that new shiny lead just came in and it's like, oh, maybe they'll come over right away. They probably won't, but I get excited because it's new. And then, you know, I get stuck. So, all right. So that's a great, great piece of advice. I mean, I just think like business is the long game. And so just because you can do it doesn't mean you should. It doesn't make it the right next thing for you to do. And so, you know, for sure, there are some fundamentals that every agent has to do if you want to be a full-time agent. But it just feels to me. And again, it was humbling to get that advice early in my career because it's true. What I was waking up every day looking for the next best brightest idea rather than just going and doing the one thing that I had already committed to doing consistently over time and we'll rebuild something that was sustainable. What's the worst piece of advice you've ever received? Worst piece of advice. Well, I've gotten a lot of bad advice, too. But I think the one that pops in my head, or again, early in my career, I was talking to an experienced agent, somebody that I looked up to respected and was trying to get some guidance around how to work with the particular buyer. Now, this was probably one of the first five or six clients that I had. So we're talking 2006, 2007, early early in my career. And I was showing them properties that the client had requested to go see. And the agent just said, oh, don't show that house. She pointed to one of them and said, don't show that house. And they said, why not? And she said, it's a split level. Who wants to live in a split? And I was like, oh, I didn't know split levels were bad. I didn't have any idea that that was a thing, right? So I took that advice and called the clients and echoed the sentiment without thinking it through, right? Without really getting good clarity about what I was about to say. And I said, well, this one's a split level. So that might not be as desirable. And the client said, well, I grew up in a split level. And well, fortunately, I was able to recover. But why was the worst advice? So it wasn't that incident. What I learned from it, I learned an amazing, amazing lesson from that. It was the worst advice because it presumes. It takes a position of presumption that we should never ever have as real estate agents. We should never presume to understand what it is that the client wants or needs. We should always, always, always be open to letting them guide the process. And so it was the worst advice because it came from the worst place. It came from this place of judgment and decision making that we really don't earn with our clients until they give us permission to do that. And in that point, I certainly didn't have the permission. I certainly did not the experience. And I most definitely did not have, did not have the knowledge base to be making that kind of a judgment. I think that's terrible advice. I think that we have to work our way through relationship in order to get our clients what they want. It's not what we think they want. It's not what they, we, it's not what their parents think they want. It's not what we think they should want. It's, it's to get them what they want. That's, that's what pure advocacy and, and service is. And so I'll never forget that moment. It was like, wow, that was really, really terrible advice. And driven by the totally the wrong thing.

Thank you. That was an awesome intro. I love it. I love it. You've done a lot of awesome things. I'm excited to have you on and to share some of the wisdom you've gained as you already have in the advice you said earlier to our audience. Well, I was like to start at the beginning. So tell us how and why you got started at real estate. If you haven't heard the story of the reluctant REALTOR, you're about to. Hi, you know, my professional career started out in advertising. I worked from Boston to LA predominantly in new business and sales for various different iterations. And you can sort of time stamp it. This is early 2000. So I did spend a lot of time in the early phases of internet, internet, internet advertising. So you know, back in the day when web banners and, you know, pay per click was, was not a thing yet. It was really just about online advertising through, through digital media. And I spent the better part of my first seven or eight years in professional sales selling internet advertising. I got, I got, I kind of got lucky in finding an opportunity with a, with a company called Network Communications Incorporated, which was a publishing company in 2003, 2003. I hope to put them, but they published this thing called the real estate book. And those agents that have been around since prior to 2010 would know the real estate book because it was the most widely published real estate listings magazine in the country. Over 10 million copies every four weeks in 700 markets. And basically this was the best possible version pre-Zillow pre-reelter.com, pre, you know, MLS for consumers to get access to listings. It was in a publishing format. And so I worked for Network Communications for a couple of years. And while doing that, I got exposed to the industry. And I had never had an exposure to real estate prior to that. I didn't really understand the business, but I spent, you know, the better part of 24 to 36 months flying around the country, going into boardrooms, going into brokerage meetings, and selling advertising to real estate agents. I realized quickly I was much more entrepreneurial than I was as a, you know, than I was likely to be a corporate guy. And so I made the decision in 2005 that I was going to pursue a career for myself. And I didn't quite know whether I was going to go to law school or I was going to go get an MBA or whether I didn't really have any clue what my future held. Of course, I was, you know, in my late 20s at the time. So life was wide open to me. But I figured I'd go get a real estate license in the interim just to, just to hold me over. I figured that that would be a good way for me to, you know, sort of fill the gaps in between this big career that I had and whatever came next. And it didn't take very long for me to figure out that like, huh, maybe this is the thing. Maybe this thing right here is the thing. It took a little while for me to get comfortable with the idea because of course, like a lot of people I had ego and, you know, I'd had a title and I put on a suit every day and I got to fly on airplanes and go into boardrooms and I felt real important about myself, you know, in that job. But it didn't pay nearly as well as real estate. It was nowhere near as fulfilling. I mean, it didn't feel like I was satisfying or serving, you know, my heart in that job because there wasn't really any beneficiary. You know, it was all ad buys and, you know, cost per, cost per impressions and things like that. So when I got into real estate, I found a part of me was, was being filled up. I was, I was thrilled to work with customers. I loved the process. I loved the service component of it. And I was actually pretty good at it. So it came kind of natural. So, you know, moving through 2006, I got my license 2007, 2008. I'm sort of getting my feet wet. I'm still dabbling in other things. You know, I'm like doing some consulting. I'm still doing some other sales. And like 2008, somewhere around May, I'm like, you know what? The market's really, I'm going to jump in. Full, as possible time to join this business. Time to do this. And so I burned the boats, blew up the bridges, jumped in with both feet and in November and Ron collapsed. You know, and so it was wild experience, but the best thing about that. And this is really the message for every agent that's out there today, suffering through this current climate. The best thing about starting in 2008, really committing to being in the business is I know any better. I did not know any better. And so the market conditions of that time were the market conditions that trained me that made me the person that is able to get up every day and focus on what matters versus what does. In fact, then it was a totally different market than we're in now. As far as the conditions, it was a short sale, pre-foreclosures. You know, distressed inventory market versus now where we're in low inventory and a whole bunch of other conditions, again, depending on which market you're in. But the job was the same. The job was wake up and sign something, sell something or set an appointment. That was it. Those were the three hallmarks of whether I had a successful day. I would look at the calendar and I would say, where is an opportunity for me to go sign an agreement? Either with a buyer client that's going to hire me or a listing client that's going to hire me. Where is there an opportunity for me to take one of my current customers who's already hired me and find them a house that they're willing to buy or find somebody who's willing to buy one of the listings that I currently have? Or if I can't do either one of those things today, I'm just going to go find the next person that I can go sit down with and tell them why I should be the REALTOR that they choose. And so sign something, sell something or set an appointment, became my mantra. I wrote it every day on the top of a yellow note pad that I worked off of because I did everything pre-CRM because I couldn't afford top producer. And I figured that all of that technology stuff was more confusing than I needed. So I built my entire business out of a spiral notebook, just flipping the pages and writing on the top, sign sell set, every single day. My objective was never to end the day without doing at least one of those things. And so that was the business. That's how I started. Yeah, I used to have a, I put it on my desktop on my computer. It was basically says no more zero days. So even even if I got to the end of the day or close to the end of the day. And I have never been a producing agent, but for what I do is I recruit REALTOR. So I have a similar kind of thing. And I have to kind of do the exact same activities you're talking about. And you know, it would it would be like, oh my gosh, like I spent all day on customer service or servicing my existing, you know, agents that I'm trying to recruit, but I haven't generated any new leads or I haven't closed anyone in a few days. And realizing that all three of those, those activities have to be done as best as possible. You know, and always remembering that, you know, there's ways to, to hit those. There's habits to, to begin to, you know, to hit those. And you know, Brian Baphini talks talks a lot about this. And I think most of us probably have heard of Brian Baphini. I probably listened to him a bit. But he's a big fan of that. Like, meet two to five people every single day as one of the, you know, sort of, you know, getting at least more people in your database. And it's like, even if you just did that and nothing else, you'd never really be out of business. You, you might not be a come a great REALTOR. And if you don't, you know, learn the craft and do a really good job, you might not be great customer service. But if you're meeting people every day, you're going to find new opportunities. I mean, I'm so, I'm so passionate about what this industry has done for me and what it can do for people. And then equally as frustrated with how people waste the opportunity. Like the real estate license might be the greatest gift to somebody with the natural service heart of anything out there because you understand that like the simplest thing you can do is wake up every day and go help people solve problems. And if you happen to have a real estate license and you're the person that helps somebody figure out how to get their patio fixed or get a new roof put on or figure out a drainage problem or get a plumber to come over and fix that leak that they've got or whatever. If you, if you become a professional problem solver in your community and all you do as a job as the J.O.B. is make sure that you know lots of people and know how to solve lots of problems. Your real estate business will take care of itself. You do not need the fancy CRM. You don't need to spend thousands of dollars on leads. You don't need to, to live in a dark cold basement with a swinging light bulb over your head and cold call for six and a half hours every day. Those things are not necessary. But what happens is because agents are unwilling to do the work of engaging the world, which is one of our catchphrases, when we say you must engage the world, because the agents are unwilling to go and engage the world and talk to the barista and talk to the people and network the community and be involved, they wind up defaulting to sitting behind a computer and playing office all day and getting far, far worse results. When you really meet top producing agents, what do they all have in common? They're out there meeting people. They call people every single time that very rarely do you meet. It's a rare case where the top producing agent is like, oh, I'll tell you my system. My system is I do, you know, four and a half hours of cold calling every day. Yes, those agents exist and there are top producers, but that is actually the edge case, not the norm case. And then what happens is we take brand new people and we try to teach them edge case instead of, instead of shooting down the middle. And I think that's bananas. I think it's so much of the rhetoric in the industry is about like, you know, grinding it out and this hustle culture mindset and like, I got to tell you, you can have a lot of fun in this business. You can have a lot of fun. You can be a professional problem solver, be the resource for them and your business will take care of itself. It will just literally grow all by itself. I had an interview once with a top producing agent and he said, you know, this is going to sound funny, but it goes on the only one I know that does this. And it's very similar to what you were talking about where he said my, the way I deepen relationships with clients and also it's how I get invited to meet new clients through referrals is he said it's really not as much about me helping them buy your cell property, which I do. I'm a good, I do a good job with that. But he said, I will call them, you know, then there's like seven years in between, you know, they're going to use you again. So what do you do? And he said, what I was always doing was calling people and he goes, I realized that everyone who owns a home always has an unfinished project. Whatever it is could be something super minor, you know, getting some holes replaced in the walls where paintings you stop be or could be getting a new roof or whatever, you know, and he said, everyone's got something on that to do list that they're just kind of pushing down down the, down the, you're kicking down down the field because they're just, you know, they don't have time to do it. He said, I would just call and see like, hey, what's, you have any unfinished projects right now? I want to help you with that. And he would just go, okay, let's help you take the next step. I got the right person for you. Give me, you know, give me a day or two. I'll be, and he's like, that's all I did. He's job about solving problems. I was like, that is brilliant. And he goes, because everybody's got one. And then he says inevitably, I just get business that way. Well, you're, you're, again, you're coming from contribution. You're, you're entering the conversation with a thoughtful heart saying, hey, how, how can I help you right now? And people appreciate that. And then, you know, maybe every 10 calls or something that's like, yeah, you can help me. And oh, by the way, you might be able to help my neighbor too because they were just mentioning the other day that they're getting their house ready to sell. And I'm so glad you called. It's, it's, again, it's not complicated. I think that we've, we've just, we've just brought so much complexity to the industry from the standpoint of how we operate. And what I, what I literally think, you know, my, my calling is is to help agents simplify it down to the basics, not to make it sound that it's not, not to make it sound like it's, you know, rudimentary because it's not, you know, the, the transactions obviously involve a pretty sophisticated level of understanding. And you've got to navigate the emotional experience of the client that you're serving. And so there's a whole lot of skill that goes into that. But the foundational elements of the J. O. B. The part that's hard is the acquisition of new customers. And that part, you know, you just go serve people, just go be available to help people. And, and the rest of it's going to work itself out. Now, that requires you to engage the world. If you sit in your house waiting for them to show up, that's not going to work. It's not going to happen. Yeah. And the worst, the worst part is that sometimes it does happen. And that will sort of reinforce this idea that something falls into our lap. You know, we get lucky. You get that phone call that you weren't expecting that you didn't really earn, but you know, you, whatever, you got lucky. And then you're like, this is how it works sometimes. And then you work, yes, the worst thing that can happen to a brand new agent in the business is they can stumble themselves into like a $1.2 million listing, you know, by accident and be like, this is the greatest thing ever. And it's like, boy, listen, I'm not trying to burst your bubble here. But that one didn't, that one did not show up as a result of effort. Like sometimes what happens. And then, you know, there is, you will have to deploy effort over time. You will have. So let's talk about sort of the conditions of the market right now. They're fairly universal in this country. Obviously, there's edge exceptions and other markets that are probably thriving. Certainly in Chicago, we're dealing with, I mean, you deal with the entire state of Connecticut. So you, you know, a lot more about the East Coast. But for us, we just have a lot, a lack of inventory. We have a lot of people, you know, locked into 3% mortgages who don't want to, don't want to move. And you can understand that. So we just have a lot fewer listings. And of course, we have buyers that are coming in with not a whole lot of inventory. So, and there's people who are, you know, pining away for that 3% mortgage that they missed out on as a buyer. And so they're thinking maybe, you know, maybe I should wait. And so, you know, there's just a few of those challenges. Plus, all the, you know, recent changes in the industry. And certainly the some of the bad publicity. I live in Chicago where the headquarters of the National Association of Real Courts are right down the street. And, you know, we certainly know that they've had some some bad press. So, so there are some some challenges. But there's always opportunity too. So I, I would love to know, you know, this kind of harkens back to your trial by fire getting thrown in at really the more and more challenging times, probably the most challenging time in recent, you know, history to be a REALTOR. And just kind of going, oh, I don't really know that this is as bad as other people know, because in 2005, I wasn't practicing when it was a little bit easier. A lot easier. So what, how are you, you've got a big team you guys close a home actually several homes almost every single day. What are, what are you doing to keep the team motivated to keep the productivity going? Is it the same, same activities as always or have you pivoted? So just love to hear that sort of your thoughts there. Well, we're for sure pivoted. You know, the thing is is I don't, but I don't think you ever stop pivoting. You know, having been in a leadership role now, let's just say for 15 years since I started the team in 2010, I mean, it feels like every 12 to 18 months you're pivoting. You're, you're, there's always a new market that you need to adapt to and the new market is only new and requires adaptation until everybody gets the story. And then once everybody gets the story, everybody goes, oh, okay, these are the rules of the game and engage. And then it gets busy again. And then something changes and then people pivot and then everybody wants to hold on hold on. What are the rules of the game? Oh, the rules are this ready set engage. And so I feel like I've seen that happen a lot. So to address where we're at right now, this is no question a skills based market. The agents that are winning right now are agents that are practicing our agents that are that are very, very good at the dialogues that they need to have. And I don't like using the word script because again, a script sounds like it's, you know, prepared and the same every time it's not really what it is, but there are conversations. There are there are moments in conversations where you do know that there's an outcome. So let's take the one that you just brought up, for instance, you've got a client who's in a 3% mortgage. But living inside of a house that no longer suits their needs and saying, well, I have a 3% mortgage. I'm living in a house that no longer suits my needs. But I'm willing to sit here and suffer because I don't want to participate in a higher mortgage. And so there's a conversation there. There's a there's a crafted conversation that you can have with that person that doesn't necessarily. It's not again, it's not about convincing them, but at least opens the door to what the realities are between them staying versus them going. And I think again, the most experienced agents are practicing those conversations. They're practicing what are the right questions to ask. And in order to help expose that potential seller to the potential miss the potential opportunity to miss out on additional increasing opportunity in the market on the lifestyle that they might live in the house that they actually desire. And what is the actual cost of that versus the cost of staying. And so those risk reward sort of certainty versus uncertainty dialogues are crucial. But most agents, you know, they're again, they're looking for the will tell me what to say. The answer is, well, there is nothing, there's nothing to say. There's questions to ask. And then there's information to provide. And then outcomes that you can that you can help your customer understand, which will lead them there. So another example of this is just sort of like, how do you win in a hyper competitive market, like like the market that we're in here in Connecticut, where our inventory is operating at about 30% of what we had pre-COVID. I mean, we just don't have houses to sell and we have so many buyers who want to buy homes. And how do you help a buyer understand the risk and consequences of let's take a real controversial one. Let's really spike the message towards waving a home inspection. Sure. Like how do you how do you talk to a buyer about waving a home inspection without saying you have to do this or endorsing it, but giving them the freedom to make the decision and understand the risk. And I think that that's the difference. I think that what professional agents do is they practice that conversation until until they understand exactly what words to say to help a customer understand why waving a home inspection might be in their best interest. Even though it's not in their best interest and they the two things can actually go excess. You know, so exactly. It's an incredible it's a complicated nuanced conversation that professionals can have and and and amateur struggle with. And so so that's that's that's how you move people through the pipeline. Yeah, you you practice you drill and you know, we're talking about drills and I love chat GPT is very helpful for this for you know, you can you know, for $20 a month or maybe even for free. I guess you could do it for free as well is you can start talking to your phone and saying, hey, imagine, you know, you're a home seller. You've got a 3% mortgage. I'm going to start asking questions and I'm going to try to address concerns you might have not to try to persuade you, but just keep the conversation going and maybe offer a different perspective. For example, you know, another thing to consider, because I'm in that situation where I my home serves me today probably won't serve me in a year. And but in a year, if rates come down, I'm going to be competing up against a heck of a lot more buyers. So do what I rather compete now, pay a little bit more, maybe, then I'd like to or certainly my rates going to be higher than I'd prefer to be but whatever, 6.5% I can handle that, but but still not super comfortable. But what I rather compete to today's environment versus, you know, a year where maybe rates come down a full point and half. Well, then, you know, but the floodgates are open and now the sudden, you know, we might be giving away even more. So so there's there and again, not to persuade me to make that decision, but just to get me to realize, you know, there are sort of other things to consider and and also just to have that conversation about what's most important to you right now, you know, you know, most people consider dating the rate, marrying the home and, you know, and that's like, oh yeah, of course, you know, it's like nobody nobody wants to buy when when the stock is down either, right? But that's the best time, you know, obviously or what I mean, you in the situation, you just outlined, you know, for agents that are listening that say, hey, Matt, I encounter this all the time, you know, what I would say is the question for you is, well, how long do you expect to be in this next house that you're, you know, it's going to be it's going to be a wild. So you're going to go seven or eight years and you go, okay, cool. So, you know, over the course of that seven or eight years that you're going to be there, do you know, are you anticipating that you're going to get a house that you really enjoy and that fulfills needs for your family and like because nobody actually wants to transact real estate, that's not why people wake up and call a rilter. They don't say, today's the day to buy, that's that's not that's not how it works. It's a life need that they're trying to solve for and it's either my house doesn't work for me anymore or my house is too expensive or you know, there's a million different conditions that can exist, which would make somebody pick up the phone, call a rilter and say, I think now is the time, but a really experienced agent understands how to guide a client through the process of discovery that gives them all the options and then also, and this is the most important part, a really good advocate also stays detached from the outcome in that maybe now's not the right time, but here's what's here's a good news is I'm not going anywhere. So when the time is right, you'll call me because I did a good job in helping you make a decision and that is the beauty of the business is that you're not actually selling anything, you know, that that concept of of like selling houses is just really outdated. It's not what we do anymore. You know, we sell our service for sure there is a sale at some point, someone needs to hire you and they need to make a decision based on the value proposition that you presented that you're the best person to serve their need, but but the houses are relevant, right? Back to that comment about the split level, like it doesn't really matter what house the client buys is what's right for them. That's the most important piece. Yeah, it's such a great conversation, you know, I was thinking if I were a producing agent today and I didn't have, you know, I wasn't swarmed with with my own listings and or maybe I'm dealing with a lot fewer listings for my buyers. I might think, okay, well, what do I do right now? Well, one thing I could do is I could call everybody in my database and say, hey, I'm updating your records and I realize I don't know your three years sort of plan for where you currently are, maybe five years. I just would love to know like, what are you thinking of moving in in the next few years? Because I need to start thinking about how to get you ready for that or or just want to update my my records. You know, it's as simple as that and there you all of a sudden you'll find all sorts of maybe not immediate opportunity, but you'll certainly have the person go, wow, that's really thoughtful of you. That's that's super kind. You know, is the is there is there accountant doing that? Maybe, maybe not. Is there accountant saying, hey, let's talk about the next five years? Probably not. Probably saying let's do the test. Right now. Yeah, you know, a good financial advisor does that, but you know, even a lot of those people don't. So yeah, even a lot of those guys are not practicing the way to have a conversation with the client who's, you know, nervous about what's the impact of tariffs going to be on my 401k. And, you know, they're not practicing either. So, you know, the differentiation between a pro and an amateur is the quality of the conversation. And, and, you know, I appreciate the skill and I appreciate the craft of being a professional real estate agent because I know that I put that we put the time in on our team to make sure, I mean, literally this morning, our morning call, went an hour and 15 minutes as we practiced live, our entire team of 30 full-time professional agents practiced live, walking a buyer through offer presentation. Now, you'd think for a team that's putting 600 houses under contract in a year that offer preparation and offer presentation would be rudimentary, but we don't take that for granted. It's, you know, I look at that like, you know, professional football players don't stop practicing throwing and catching, right? They don't stop practicing the fundamentals. They don't say, well, we're at the NFL level now. We only throw in the game. We only catch in the game. Like, how insane would that be? Like, but that's what agents do. They wait for the moment. They wait for the game moment to practice, but that's, that's just not how we operate. So, my advice to agents that are out there and so I know agents really often don't like the idea of practice. They feel weird. You know, you got to have fun with it. It's practice. It's fun. It's like, this is, this is where you should mess up and laugh and joke and say stupid things and then be like, all right, let me try that again. Practice, practice the conversations because there are outcomes that your clients are really waiting for. They want you to help them. That's what they're there for. They're looking for help around us. That is a very, very wise statement that the quality of conversations is really what differentiates the top from from everyone else. And that is absolutely true. And it's true in my business and in my recruiting business as well because there's lots of recruiters, there's lots of great firms out there. And, you know, one firm to another, yeah, there's slight differences, you know, between, you know, Keller and Coldwell and, you know, RE/MAX and it's sent to 21. They're a Berkshire. They're all good companies. They all have great stuff. And it's a more of, and you know, splits are kind of, you know, wherever they are. But the reality of it is, it's about having the, you know, the best conversations and knowing sort of how to continue those conversations. Oh, versus, hey, are you naive? Are you thinking of moving your firm? Oh, you should talk me because, of course, hey, that's great. What that happens. But, but it's more about, hey, let's, let's talk about your plan. You know, where do you want to be in the next three to five years? You know, how is your brokerage helping you do that or not? And so I use that a lot and I need, but do I practice it a lot? No. And that is a great reminder for me and probably everyone to think about, do we have a drill partner? Do we have somebody that we can actually role play with and throw really tough objections? And not objections so that you can overcome and win the business as Matt says, you know, that's, that's not really the point. But just being able to, to, to absorb that question, to not let it throw you off your game and to have an answer, to have an actual answer that's authentic and true and not to, you know, and again, it's a little scary. You do have to humble yourself a little bit to drill. And it reminds me of that great, it's one of my favorite sayings. It's before enlightenment, chop wood, carry water, after enlightenment, shop wood, carry water. I just got to keep drilling. Well, you know, as long as you're going to be in the business and you started this out by saying, you know, do you pivot? And yes, you pivot. I mean, the conversations I'm having today are markedly different than the conversations I had three years ago. And significantly different than the conversations I had five years ago, pre-COVID, or at the beginning of the pandemic, what kind of conversations that I have to have with a seller about about the long-term impact of what was happening in the world. And, you know, the quality of those conversations determines are those clients for life. Did they feel they got good guidance and counsel from you at a time when they needed it? And if all you're looking for is the transaction, if you're a hammer and everybody's in nail, you're going to get lucky a couple times, because there's going to be some people that are going to show up and say, like, hey, I'm a nail, you want to sell me right place. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. That's going to happen. And there's lots of those agents out there. And you know what, they sell three to four houses a year. And they don't get referral and repeat business where, you know, the average agent on our team is selling 30 to 40 homes a year. And our business is 80% repeat, sphere, and referral business. That's who we are. Why? Because we practice the conversations we have. We are full-time professional agents that go into the marketplace with a desire to serve. And yes, sell houses too. But first, we sell problems. That's what we do first. Yeah. It's that givers get mentality. I want to talk about events. I know your team is, and you particularly are very passionate about creating value-based events. And so you've created a service all around that. But tell us about sort of your philosophy around client events and what you've seen the most effective. Well, this is, it's such a great segue, because it really does speak to the philosophy that I bring to the business, which is that, you know, early in my career, I was taught that script. Matt, call everyone you know, and say hi, and then ask them, who do you know that wants to buy sale or invest in real estate? And it didn't feel right then. And then when I did it a few times, I was like, this is really awful. It does, it's not aligned with what I'm really interested in doing. It doesn't feel anything like the professional sales jobs that I used to have, which had this needs analysis and custom, you know, custom designed solution. It feels incredibly vapid. And so I think that there's a better way. That said, you do have to lead generation. Lead generation is a huge part of what you have to do every day. So, it was a moment in my career. It was pretty early on, I would say 2009, where I was starting to have some early success. Maybe I had, you know, sold, I think in 2009, I sold maybe 50 houses. You know, as more or less a solo agent, I think I had some like transaction support, but nothing is for the way. Great. What's your third year? That's a pretty good third year. Third year short sale school or I mean, I probably at all times had 15 to 20 short sales listed. I didn't have any like REO relationships. I just hustled for people that needed help. Like I was door, I was looking for people that needed help. And so when I found them, I would list their properties and then I was serving. So I had a great, great sort of business sort of early, early business getting going. And I realized that I was doing what a lot of agents do because fundamentally I like people. I mean, that's a core part of my personality. I like people. But I was doing a terrible job at keeping in touch with all these people. You know, there was just so many of them and it was really hard to stay in in relationship. I want to reframe this too for the younger listeners. You know, 2010, we weren't texting a lot. This was like, you know, we were two, three years into the cell phone, smart phone thing, 2007 the iPhone came out. Texting wasn't really yet a primary mechanism for communication. And I don't really think, I mean, Facebook was what 2009, 10, something like that. So, you know, we're still operating like probably faxing shit. Like I was probably still faxing offers to every third agent, you know. So, communication was a little more challenging. So I was out one night after a softball game with one of my buddies. And we were talking and he also owned a business, a construction business. And we were talking about ways that we've successfully gone and gotten new clients. And he just made this comment because this was a bar that had 86 craft beers on tap. And at the time, I was, I was kind of into that. And he just made this kind of comment like, it's just too bad you can't try them all. And it immediately, like some combination of the conversation we were having about business building and trying 86 beers. I was like, but what if you could? What if I had a beer tasting? What if I invited all these people that I've served that are part of my community that I'm building around my real estate business to come to a beer tasting? I wonder if I could do that. And so I reached out to the manager of that bar the next day and I said, hey, what would it cost me to rent out the bar for a night? And if I did that, could I do like 12 two ounce samplers for each, for each, you know, for everybody that comes in or maybe it was maybe it was 20, it was like 36 ounces of beer, something like like three beers, you know, could I do that for everybody? And could I do like a, you know, like a Bavarian food thing sometime in November and we came up with I came up with this concept called harvest vest. And it was my very first event. I was sweating bullets because the price of the game was $8,800. So it was giving me $800 bucks for me to have 100 people so it was $88 bucks ahead. I was totally, totally stressed because I was like, that was at a time when like $800 bucks was like a lot of money. I needed that money in order to like pay my own bills the next month. Sure. But I was like, well, but I feel like if I can get all 100 people in this room, I can probably get some business from it. And it'll help me move the, move the relationships forward. So, so I created the event came up with it. I had a fantastic assistant at the time who helped us organize it. And we put the event together and that what that night, that night of the event. I'm sweating bullets because I'm like, it's a lot of money. Yeah. Rear of the people that I had invited that at RSVP came with a friend that they had an RSVP for. And they came in and they immediately apologized. Matt, this is so cool. I'm so sorry, but I brought my friend Joe. He has to meet you. He wants to buy a house. Matt, I'm so sorry. I brought my friend Sally. Sally, I know she's not invited and you want to start it, but Sally needs to get her house on the market right away. Like immediately three people showed up that night that became my client. And I'm like, this is it. This is it. I never asked anybody for referrals. None of the conversations leading up to the event or the invitation had anything to do with real estate. It was nothing more than come join me for a beer tasting to thank you for all your support as I've gotten my real estate business up and going. And Harvest Fest became an annual event that we did every year. We did it for 10 years from 2010 to 2020 or 2010 to 2019. So maybe nine years we did it because 20 we canceled because of COVID. And so that was an annual event. And what I learned from that was that the event itself was the least important part. The most important part was the opportunity to stay in deep relationships with lots of people over a period of time was to create something memorable that put you into an environment that went beyond just REALTOR and into like call it friend zone like hey, we're more than just it's more than professional. It was something that was in alignment with me personally because I liked to drink beer. So it wasn't unusual for me to be in a bar drinking good beer. And so all of those things created authenticity alignment and a great opportunity for me to stay in touch with people. And the business just grew. And then we said well, what kind of events also work like that. And then as the team grew, we built bigger and bigger events to the point now where we do eight to 12 VIP client events every year and getaways. Our biggest event we do 15 we typically get about 1500 people at a minor league ballpark here in Hartford the Hartford yard goats. We invite like 4,000 people to that event. The invitations are all personal invitations. This is not a blood email blast. We call them. We text them. We ask them if they can join us because what's most important is the relationship building up. And the events as a part of your business can be the greatest lead generator of all time. That the piece that really struck me and sunk this for me was the ratio 100 to 1 compared to the ratio 12 to 2. And they teach this in the red book, the millionaire real estate agent book written by Gary Keller. They teach that you know after years of study what they understood was that if you have 12 people, every 12 people that you have that you communicate value to over a period of a year and you give some form of consistent communication to not spam by the way. Spam doesn't count. That's not value. That's garbage. Not your email newsletter. No, not your email newsletter. You got to communicate value to them over the course of a period of a year. For every 12 people, there are two opportunities. So that means for every 250 people, there are 40 opportunities. So if you have 250 people in a sphere database, that means that they know you, you know them. This is not a database like phone email. This isn't just a collection of names. This isn't a phone book. These are people that know you. If they see you in the grocery store, they say hi. DJ did to see you, right? They say hello. 250 people will create 40 opportunities, 40 at that. So it doesn't mean you'll get a closing, but 40 opportunities for every 250 people. Wow, what a great business. That's not that many, right? Versus the ratio of paper click internet ads or strangers or cold calling or circle prospecting or door knocking. The ratio being 100 to one. So I just thought of that and said, so every time I go out, I should always invite 12 people. Because if I go out to dinner and I can get a table of 12, there's a high probability that there's two people at that table that have some real estate need or know somebody who has a real estate need. And you know, I test it all the time and it always finds up true. There's always somebody in a small group like that that has something on their radar and maybe not now, but sometime in the near future. So a sphere driven business that's backed up by events and giveaways can be a very, very powerful tool and way for you to, I call it just kind of hack your lead generation in a way that makes the business a lot more fun. Because it's a lot more fun to go to a beer tasting than to sit in a room for four hours and cold call. Yeah. And boy, that makes all the sense in the world. I love that. And plus there's there's a consistency to it that the clients grow to expect in a good way. Look forward to this better way to say it. We would always give away these custom pint glasses. And I would for years, I still to this day get them. It's been five years since we did harvest fast. I'll get a picture texted to me of a pint glass full of beer with somebody saying, drinking out of my favorite pint glass, or I'll get a picture of a collection because somebody made six out of the 10 years, you know, like we had our we had our fans for harvest fast. So let's let's pivot just briefly to talk a little bit about, you know, right now there's a flight for a lot of solo agents into teams or the idea of creating a team, you know, we're seeing a lot of value in well, potential value, we'll say, and joining forces, you have a team. You know, when somebody, I guess we'll maybe start with people looking to join a team because of and we should also mention if you are in anywhere in Connecticut and you are not getting the attention, you feel you you need or you're not getting the assistance that you want from your current brokerage or your current team lead reach out to Matt and his team. He he is very picky about who he selects because of course they're high producing, but he would love to chat with you and see if there's some synergy there. So you can reach out to him. We'll have his info in our show notes and he's easy to find just Google them, but Matt, let's talk about individual agents that are going, hmm, should I join a team? What are your some of your thoughts? Well, I think fundamentally it's a philosophy. I think it starts with a philosophy and it is the classic and this is cliche, but it's a cliche for a reason because it's true. Teams operate really well with people who like to collaborate, okay, and there are two different types of people. There are people who really enjoy collaboration and winning together and there are people who really just want to go it alone and kind of don't leave me alone. Let me do my thing. If you're a collaborator, if you're a person that desires that, a team can be a great a great environment for you. There are two things that people really struggle with when they're an independent producer and they're asking the question, should I join a team? There's always two. One is this one because obviously if you're partnering with a team, the team has to get paid. So there's a there's a there's a different economic model. That's the first one. The other one is always identity, which is, you know, or ego around the brand, but what about me and my name? The ego identity one is much easier to explain because at the end of the day, the client doesn't care about the team anymore than they care about the brokers. They're in a relationship with you, the agent. Nobody cares where you work or who you work for. The team is the team is nothing more than support and and built in super efficient leverage. A really good team should be to a top producing single eight solo agent or top producing solo agent should look at a team like outsourced already built ready to run leverage. Like you can build your own car or you can buy one and drive it. You're going to pay to just go to the car lot and buy a car that runs but a really good team should be able to provide you a car that's just going to run. And by the way, really good team should be the should you should be able to pull that car over when it needs new tires and you're just going to put it on and say, hey, go go hit the road again. Someone's there to help you. Yeah, they're going to top it off with gas. They're going to they're going to you know, they're going to create it. And I always said that I think that what what you know, and it give Gary Critt Keller a lot of credit. Gary wrote the red book at a time where he looked at the industry and said, what makes this industry a business? And he did a great job of articulating that. And I see that like he wrote the map. Like he he was like Lewis and Clark to the real estate. And he said, here's a map. Here's a roadmap on how to build a high functioning, you know, organization. It's not the only way to do it, but he wrote a map like just like Lewis and Clark only took one path to the what, but there was lots of different ways to go, but he he wrote it and he he memorialized it and he became you know, he got famous for it, right? And I think what real estate teams did is they said, cool, now there's lots of these agents out there that have a map. But what we've learned is most of these agents are not great at building cars. Like they're really, really good. They can read the map, but then they put together a car and they've got different size wheels and hoods one color and the steering wheel and they're patching together, you know, pieces of engine parts. And it's like they're not great mechanics or automakers. Oh, it's a totally different skill set. It's totally different skill set, right? And so the team good teams, I always think of ourselves as like we are we are the auto dealer. Like we're we're we're agents go because they're like, I understand the map and I really want to go far. But I feel like it's going to take me a really long time to learn how to build this car thing that I should drive in. Currently riding a horse, but it looks like you've got a couple of cars that I could run in and we say, yeah, we have a couple cars. You could jump right in and start driving. Here's what our economic relationship looks like. Now the thing is is like how much farther can you go in a car versus a horse? And so when you start to actually look at the economics of, you know, what does an average agent do when they're on their own? Again, we're talking about average. What do the average agents do when they're on their own versus what do the average agents do when they're on a team? Well, the average agent on our team is doing 35 to 40 deals a year. That's six times the national average. So like, what are the odds that you're going to do six times the national average without driving a car? You can do it yourself. You just have to build your own car. So I'm a firm believer in teams. I'm a firm believer even though what also needs to be said is that agents need to also understand that many team leads are making no money too. Like they, they're, they're, it's, it's not some like, you know, line your pockets cash machine. Yeah. It's an incredibly difficult thing to take on. And, and agents that, in teams that do it really well, they honor their profit because they understand that in order to run an effective business, you have to be profitable. They honor the production because they understand that in order to have profit, you've got to have people that have all the tools and resources they need in order to go sell. They honor their growth because they know that agents that join a team aren't going to stick around very long if they're not growing and having new and bigger better opportunities. And they honor their culture because nobody wants to be in a locker room where everybody, you know, pissed off and upset. So, so a good team runs by those four pillars and agents that are collaborators by nature should be able to walk into, you know, we call it a winning locker room experience. And they should feel it right away. They should feel like these are my people. I totally get it. And I see how I make more money here. And then, and then the outcome should be should be, you know, then it's up to the team lead to deliver the outcome. Yeah. No, that's, that's great. So, and I too, I also just want to just quickly touch on those of us that think joining a team will solve my lead problems. And there are teams that will dangle a carrot that looks like that. And maybe they can deliver on that promise. But what we're talking about is whether that's a good idea to for for an agent to look for that solution from that team. I'm sure you get this all the time. Yeah. I know I get it as a recruiter. People are like, tell me about what leads you provide. I think it's, it's a, you know, to me, it's a huge tell when an agent says that they're in it for the leads. 100%. It's a tell that they're not really, they're not really a practitioner at the level of the business that we look for. And that they're always going to be at the mercy of external factors instead of instead of just doing the work. Now leads can take a mediocre producer and turn them into an average producer. Leeds can take an average producer and turn them into an above average producer. But leads cannot take somebody who can't do the business and turn them into somebody who can. And so, you know, leads are what we, we often think of leads as like the icing on the cake. They're the thing, the thing is is remember, if your business is completely built around the idea that someone else has to do something first, you're inside of a supply chain that you have no control over. You might as well be an employee at that point. Yeah, you, you are an employee, right? You're just paying, you're just paying to go to work instead of instead of them paying you. You're actually paying to show up. So I, I mean, we, we as a team as a philosophy, of course, because we have market share, we get tons of leads. Of course, because we've been in the business for years, we get tons of leads. Of course, because we have a database that we communicate lots to, we get lots of leads. So we have lots of inbound leads, but as a, as a product of our value proposition, it never comes up. And we're talking to an agent that's interested in joining a high performing team where the average agent is making a lot of money succeeding at a high level, you know, on the leaderboard every month. When they ask about leads, we say, yeah, they're here, but that's, that's literally not even close to the reason you should be here. You should be here, because you want to win championships and you want to be in the winning locker room. And so, you know, it's, it's, that you can, again, it's, it's a disqualifier if somebody's looking for 100%. Because we have them and we get tons of them, but, and we give them to our producers. It's, we operate on a merit app. You're a business. Of course, you give them to the people most likely to close. Well, that's also something that I've always found kind of interesting, like, because I've had agents come to me in the past and be like, you know, hey, I'm getting recruited and the person said they'd give me leads. And I go, that's cool. How do you feel about the idea that they'll give you leads, but not give leads to their top producers that are already on their team? What's that mean for you once you're in the door? And they're like, oh, that's interesting. And I'm like, well, you know, again, what, what, what's that do? Like why would they've had eight, those people have had agents on their team four or five, six years. And they're going to give leads to you. That's weird to me. Like, that doesn't, that's, that's just culturally doesn't sound good. I don't want to be in that environment. From a business perspective, it doesn't sound like a smart play because, you know, you, you know, Zillow has their flex program. They don't want to give those, those are the leads that you pay on the back end, not front. And, you know, they're going to be really picky about who gets those leads because the end of the day, they need those leads closed. And, you know, bringing on a new person is a bit of an unknown. And you're right. It's, it's certainly an enticing character, Dangle, in front of somebody. But if you really think about it, like, you know, first of all, firm never has too many leads. It's never, oh, we have so many leads. We need to bring in some new people, you know, maybe I guess that's possible. But it's very unlikely. And again, why are they not giving those to the people that are most likely to close that they have, you know, assurance because they work or they're, yeah, that's a, that is, and if that's part of the recruiting strategy, then that's going to continue to be part of their recruiting strategy. You know, what we, we really live by that philosophy of, you know, the teacher man to fish versus give a man to fish. And the, the concept is we can teach somebody how to lead generate, like we're actually really, really good at that. And the reason we're good at it is because we have this built-in infrastructure around events and giveaways and database management that allows an agent to show up here. Again, we have a race car and we allow an agent to show up here and kind of hand over all their tools and parts. And we say, cool, we're going to build you a car. And then you just have to learn how to be a great driver. I just, I need you to be a fantastic driver. I need you to be the best driver ever. I need you to drive the track all day. I need you to learn that return. I need you to learn the speeds to take it at. I need you to be the best driver you can possibly be. Stop worrying about the car. I'll take care of the tires. I'll take care of the hood. I'll take care of the rest of it. We'll make sure the gas is always topped off. We'll make sure the oil's changed. You just learn to be a great driver. And most agents are like, thank God. Yeah. Because all I really wanted to do is drive anyway. Yeah. I really want to be a mechanic. And, and you find yourself in it. And by the way, like this speaks to something else you said earlier, like, I think the industry does a huge disservice to a lot of agents by giving them tons of distraction points. Like we're the, we're low hanging fruit for separating from our money because because agents are looking for a shortcut and they don't really understand. I'm going to use the car analogy again. They don't really understand how the car works. And so if you don't understand how the car works and somebody's selling you a flux capacitor, you go like, Oh, do I need that? And they're like, if you want a time travel, you do. Well, awesome. You know, give that to, I did forget that they need 1.21 gigawatts from a lightning bolt in order to make the thing work. So they're out there buying flux capacitors, putting them in their car. And they don't even know what they do. And you know, whether that's some advanced CRM system or lead generation system or out, you know, outsourced ISA system, all of it is, oh, it's too much money for, for what you're spending. You just need to do the job. And if you did the job, you don't have to spend all that money. You can actually have a profit and have a fantastic fulfilling life, by the way. Yeah, it's almost keeping those blinders on and just doing, going back to fundamentals, you know, the things that we know are tried and tested and true. And yeah, maybe they're not super sexy or fun. And you know, doing pushups isn't fun. And I have to do those too. And much is I don't want to have to do a pushup ever again or squat. But we'll say I pushups I can, I can handle squats, you know, to me are just not my favorite. Well, it's really good idea. It's a really good idea to just squats. Even if you have good form, by the way, only if you have good form. But the point is is you have to do sort of the things that that we know are going to get the ball down the field. And in this, you know, in this business, it is relationship building. You've said it. And we didn't even get to a third of the topics that I wanted to cover. But Matt is a super, super busy guys team is crushing, closing the two deals a day, you know, on average, which is incredible in in this market. And so I want everybody to do a couple of things. One, I want you to check out Matt's podcast, which is the real estate MD, you know, he's diagnosing problems. He's doing live coaching on his show. It's how cool is that. I have something I do very similar. I'm not the coach, however, but I have found that to be really fun. And if you, you know, again, one agent's challenges is every agent's challenge. So even if you're you go to his podcast and you hear something, you're like, well, I'm not currently dealing with that. You will be soon or you will at some point. So hearing that, you know, even just hearing somebody else's challenges get solved or get worked on will help you, you know, or you'll get some wisdom. So definitely check out real estate MD. We will have a link to that in the show notes. And also I want you to continue to support Matt. Check out his website, the MiaoLi team. If you are it, well, two opportunities here. If you're an agent in the Connecticut area, reach out. You've been looking for a team to join a high performing team. Matt has all sorts of wonderful programs that he's built. And again, building that car for you, teaching how to operate that car. That's his his job. And you're going to get going and run that and get some pretty amazing results. His his track record speaks for himself. His team is is unbelievable. So if you're in the Connecticut area and Matt, you are expanding. Do you want to share a little bit about, you know, where we're some of our listeners who maybe aren't in the Connecticut area? Yeah, we're we are already in Massachusetts operating in in Southern Massachusetts, Long Meadow Aguom Springfield area. We are expanding into Putnam in Westchester County in New York. And we're actively in the process of looking for partners in Rhode Island. And and you know, our expansion to I love to just it's you know, it's a long story, but I love to talk a little bit about this only because it is and has always been my philosophy to do it right, not rushed. And so we are looking for the right partners that want to follow the playbook that's got proven results and that are looking to win at the level that we're winning at. And so it's always right, not rushed. It's fine. The right people and then the results follow. We'll reach out to Matt if you are interested in either becoming a partner with Matt or becoming, you know, part of his team or if you're an agent, totally different part of the country who doesn't service the area, Matt services, but have clients that move to and from those areas that Matt mentioned, you know, he needs a referral partners as well. And he has people that move out of his area and he needs to send those leads along the way. So, you know, what a great team to get in contact with. So reach out to him, see if you guys have some synergy and can connect and, you know, help each other. Also, on behalf of the audience, want to thank Matt for his time today. Unbelievable.
