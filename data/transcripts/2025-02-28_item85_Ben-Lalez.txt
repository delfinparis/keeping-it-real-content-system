[00:01:16] Today's episode is brought to you by corded.io.
[00:01:19] Are you looking for agents to join your brokerage or team?
[00:01:23] Now, as a real estate recruiter, I can tell you the answer is always yes.
[00:01:27] But most agents aren't looking to move right now.
[00:01:30] So how do you know who to contact?
[00:01:32] Well, what if I were to tell you there's a recruiting and retention tool
[00:01:35] powered by artificial intelligence that shows you exactly which agents
[00:01:39] in your local market are looking to leave their brokerage right now
[00:01:43] and which agents at your own firm are also looking to leave you.
[00:01:48] Now, I've been recruiting REALTORS for 15 years
[00:01:50] and I've hired over 2000 agents.
[00:01:53] I can tell you with no exaggeration.
[00:01:55] This is the tool I've been waiting for.
[00:01:57] Corded's AI looks for trends across dozens of variables for each agent in your market
[00:02:02] and shows you which agents they believe are likely to move.
[00:02:05] Not only does it do that, but corded's AI went and visited my recruiting website
[00:02:10] and read everything I offer.
[00:02:12] So now when I'm recruiting, corded's AI tells me exactly what to say
[00:02:16] based on that agent's needs and what my brokerage can offer.
[00:02:20] It even writes emails for me.
[00:02:22] I've never seen anything like it and I use it every single day.
[00:02:26] Now, if you are looking to grow your brokerage,
[00:02:29] corded.io is the best tool out there.

[00:02:52] Welcome to keeping it real.
[00:02:54] The largest podcast made by real estate agents and four real estate agents.
[00:02:57] My name's DJ Paris.
[00:02:59] I am your guide and host through the show.
[00:03:02] And in just a moment, we're going to be speaking with Ben Lales.
[00:03:05] We have our special episode, our monthly episode called Better Business with Ben.
[00:03:10] Well, let me tell you about Ben.
[00:03:11] Ben Lales is a Chicago real estate agent with Compass.
[00:03:14] He is the founder and the owner of the Ben Lales team.
[00:03:18] And they have dozens and dozens of agents here in Chicago serving all of Chicago.
[00:03:23] And Ben is one of the very top teams in all of Chicago out of 46,000 agents.
[00:03:28] He's in the top two or three teams, amazing producer, top one per center.
[00:03:32] And really a visionary, somebody who is really a thought leader in this space.
[00:03:37] And I'm excited to have you on again, Ben.
[00:03:39] Yeah, thank you.
[00:03:40] And thank you for coming to my neck of the woods.
[00:03:42] Yeah.
[00:03:43] And let's promote something for you.
[00:03:44] So where would we want Ben Lales team on Instagram?
[00:03:48] And what is your website, I think, is particularly interesting.
[00:03:51] I'd like our agents and our viewers and our listeners to check it out.
[00:03:55] Because you did something very against type with your website, which is you pulled a lot of stuff out.
[00:04:00] And you made it very simple, but very clean and very unique.
[00:04:03] And I think it's really effective.
[00:04:05] Yeah, we want people to come and like, if you're a buyer or a seller, just hit one button.
[00:04:09] And like, not be confused at all about where to go.
[00:04:12] So yeah, we built it ourselves.
[00:04:13] We're not particularly proud of it.
[00:04:15] But now I'm proud of it because you just typed it up.
[00:04:17] I like it. It's really clean.
[00:04:18] The colors are really simple.
[00:04:20] And I love the fact that again, it's just like, don't make me think.
[00:04:23] And I like the fact that again, against trend, you pulled off the home search.
[00:04:27] And I and believe me, I totally understand why you do it.
[00:04:31] We have this argument in our company all the time.
[00:04:34] Do we want the home search or not?
[00:04:36] And it doesn't do us any good.
[00:04:37] But people, I guess maybe they like to see it, but they don't use it.
[00:04:41] It's an SEO play, isn't it?
[00:04:42] Isn't it about, it's about like index pages and keywords on site keywords.
[00:04:46] Does not help us at all.
[00:04:47] Yeah.
[00:04:47] I mean, no, I don't know how many we do have it kind of hidden.
[00:04:50] Yeah.
[00:04:50] But like, I don't know how many people have actually ever set up a search on them.
[00:04:54] They've got Zelo. They don't need you.
[00:04:55] They've got other places. Yeah.
[00:04:57] Yeah.
[00:04:57] All right.
[00:04:57] So we, you know, Ben comes on every month and he is somebody I look up to in this
[00:05:01] industry. He's always thinking far ahead.
[00:05:04] And yeah.
[00:05:05] And he's always got great ideas.
[00:05:07] So what do we want to talk about it?
[00:05:08] Well, I always like, actually, Ben and I were talking beforehand.
[00:05:10] We're trying to think what would be a great topic for today.
[00:05:12] And really, you know, I always like to solve problems.
[00:05:15] So we were thinking about what are some of the big challenges REALTOR's are facing
[00:05:18] right now across the country.
[00:05:20] Inventory seems to be a massive one.
[00:05:21] But we're not going to tackle inventories as much today.
[00:05:24] We're going to talk a little bit about what with the inventory that is out there.
[00:05:28] How do you win deals?
[00:05:29] Yeah.
[00:05:29] So we're going to talk about winning in multiple offer situations.
[00:05:32] We're, we, I am really lucky in that because we have, you know,
[00:05:36] 30 plus agents and we're one of the biggest buy side teams in the entire city
[00:05:40] and right, you know, we're ranked in the country now.
[00:05:42] Is we just have a ton of visibility over how many offers on, you know, on X number of properties.
[00:05:48] What is our win rate?
[00:05:49] What is our cancellation rate?
[00:05:50] And we just have a ton of data to show and support what is actually winning in these offers.
[00:05:56] We want to get into it.
[00:05:57] So here is, let's first identify the problem, I would say.
[00:06:01] So right now, as you've said, as there's a lack of inventory and depending in which sub market you're in in Chicago,
[00:06:08] you know, you're entering these situations or your, you know,
[00:06:10] our buyers are entering these situations where there's two, three, four, you know,
[00:06:14] just the other, you know, this last weekend, eight, ten offers.
[00:06:18] And the worst problem for a real estate agent is, right, you have spent, I don't know how much time,
[00:06:24] energy, money, sourcing this buyer and the time finally comes where they're like, Hey, DJ, Ben,
[00:06:31] you know, whatever you know, whoever you are, let's write an offer.
[00:06:36] And the worst thing is is losing.
[00:06:39] So not only do you, you know, not make the sale, your buyer doesn't get, get the property and you risk,
[00:06:45] honestly, got losing them because whether true or not, they're going to, they have to,
[00:06:49] they have to blame someone.
[00:06:50] And more often than not, there's only one person to blame.
[00:06:53] So the, that's a problem and the solution, I mean, we're going to talk about what the solution is, right?
[00:06:59] So
[00:07:01] there's a few things at play and I want to touch on three of them.
[00:07:07] The first one being is this all starts in our opinion with the buyer consultation and setting the expectation with your buyer around what the hell is going to happen in their home search.
[00:07:22] Yeah.
[00:07:23] I would argue that 95% of problems can be gotten out ahead of in a buyer consultation.
[00:07:31] And you know, we've been doing buyer consultations even before, you know, the big change in August, we didn't really get buyer agreement sign.
[00:07:37] But now you have to, you have to get a buyer consultation, I'm sorry, a buyer representation agreement sign anyway.
[00:07:43] So let's do it in a formal setting.
[00:07:44] Let's sit here face to face.
[00:07:45] And what your job is as a real estate agent is to explain the process.
[00:07:50] This is how it's going to go.
[00:07:52] And then also depending on the market, the sub market that your buyer is looking in.
[00:07:57] Hey, this is what you can't expect when we offer on a property.
[00:08:02] Don't be surprised when it's a multiple offer situation.
[00:08:05] And I come to you and, you know, say these words as is a, you know, appraisal gap waiver.
[00:08:14] And you need to, you know, put these ideas in your buyer's head on the front end.
[00:08:20] So that when the time comes, they're not resistant to you.
[00:08:24] Are you going into really specifics about what is an appraisal gap?
[00:08:29] You know, what is it as is clause?
[00:08:31] You're going in and saying, OK, so just so you know, if this happens, here's how to interpret it.
[00:08:36] Here's what we'll do as a result.
[00:08:38] Yep.
[00:08:38] So our buyer consultations are like an hour and a half and we try to go into as much detail as possible,
[00:08:44] especially in a competitive environment.
[00:08:47] For I don't want to waste my time.
[00:08:49] I don't want my agents to waste their time.
[00:08:50] I don't want the buyers to waste their time.
[00:08:53] And I don't want the, you know, it's just if you're not setting expectations appropriately with your buyers,
[00:08:57] you're killing them and you're killing yourself.
[00:08:59] So yeah, we go into everything.
[00:09:01] We go into everything we talk about what as is means on paper.
[00:09:06] But more importantly, what it actually means in context, there's a huge fallacy, especially here in Chicago buyers think that they can't perform an inspection or they can't ask for credits or repairs.
[00:09:19] And on paper, yeah, you're not supposed to ask for credit or repairs.
[00:09:22] But depending on your relationship with the other agent and that's something that we're going to get into, that's the second thing.
[00:09:28] You can still ask there's what is on paper and what is in practice.
[00:09:33] And that's something that we express to our buyers.
[00:09:37] So that's as is we express what actually matters in the appraisal gap waiver so that they they understand what's going on.
[00:09:44] Anyway, so that's the whole, you know, buyer.
[00:09:48] So yeah, I want to get clear.
[00:09:49] So you're having this conversation with the buyer before ever seeing a property.
[00:09:53] Yes, God you and that's a, that's got to be a change.
[00:09:56] So in the past, a lot of times the, the school of thought was if they know what they want to go see, go show them that first.
[00:10:03] And then you know, get them, get them to the property and then have that explanation of that conversation.
[00:10:08] You're doing that now before.
[00:10:09] Yeah. So and I'm also, when you have to with commissions now, well, you have to, but I'm also leaving a whole other part.
[00:10:16] I'm talking about how to win a multiple offers and you have to expectation.
[00:10:18] Sure. There's a whole host of other benefits to doing this, like making sure they can actually qualify, getting them in touch with a lender, etc.
[00:10:26] It's just, it's the most important thing.
[00:10:28] You're saving yourself so much time and you're increasing your odds of
[00:10:32] transacting with this person when you get in a room and you explain to them a few things.
[00:10:37] Hey, this process is hard, right?
[00:10:40] B, you need me and see I'm an expert and we always say like it's a scary process and you want to be the person who's the voice of reason and to calm those fears.
[00:10:49] And it's really competitive right now.
[00:10:50] Yeah. So let's get into competition and then what we try to express to buyers and is two things.
[00:10:59] One, I, we try to get this across.
[00:11:01] I, my job is to tell you what it's going to take to win on this property.
[00:11:10] I don't really like, I'm not going to say care if you win or not, but my job is to do a few things.
[00:11:17] That is to have a really great relationship with the other agents.
[00:11:21] Yeah.
[00:11:22] Really understand the market and say, hey, I, I am certain.
[00:11:27] Like I, I try to give probabilities.
[00:11:29] If you come in at price X, you have a 98% certainty of winning this.
[00:11:34] If you come in at why it drops to 90, if you come in at Z, it drops to 80%.
[00:11:39] Here's the information.
[00:11:41] I suggest if you want to win this property, here are the offer terms.
[00:11:46] So what I'm talking about is I am telling the buyer what to do.
[00:11:50] I'm not asking for their opinion.
[00:11:52] I'm the expert, right?
[00:11:54] And with that, you have to be able to understand two things is when you're offering
[00:12:00] in a multiple offer situation, yeah, your needs and wants matter, but you have to ask
[00:12:05] the question of the list agent, pay what is important to your seller.
[00:12:10] Of course, it's going to be money.
[00:12:12] But oftentimes they, you know, they're coming to the transaction with whatever baggage they have.
[00:12:17] Sure.
[00:12:17] Maybe they've gotten bitten the past with a bad mortgage, maybe close data, super important.
[00:12:22] Maybe they've got kids in school and they need to wait it out till August.
[00:12:26] Maybe they need a rent back, but you really need to become extremely clear
[00:12:30] on what's important to the seller so that you can develop an offer package.
[00:12:34] It's not just price and offer package that's super compelling to the seller.
[00:12:40] And when you send an offer, you know, we're talking about asking the buyer,
[00:12:43] the seller's agent to give you an idea of what they're looking for, what their concerns are.
[00:12:48] And even sort of what their avatar is of the perfect buyer, right?
[00:12:51] You want to know like, is it a family?
[00:12:54] Is it an individual?
[00:12:54] Of course, you know, we want to respect all the laws and make sure that we're doing this.
[00:12:59] But the idea is we want to know what they are inclined to be excited about, I guess.
[00:13:05] And my question is, so now that we know, okay, we have a somewhat of a recipe
[00:13:08] for what we think they're looking for, I'm curious about the pure aesthetics of sending in the offer.
[00:13:15] Is there anything that you recommend people do to do, to jujup the actual physical
[00:13:21] document that will not electronic, of course.
[00:13:23] But what are we doing to make it at least look a little different from everyone?
[00:13:28] It's really funny.
[00:13:29] You said you said that.
[00:13:30] I just had this conversation right before coming in where someone is offering.
[00:13:34] And I, I'm a little bit crazy.
[00:13:36] I want to make it as easy as possible for the seller's agent to actually read.
[00:13:43] Yeah.
[00:13:43] Like bullet points and bolds and, you know, make it really, really simple.
[00:13:50] Like it's essentially an outline of the offer terms, right?
[00:13:54] And I want them to be able to discern it very quickly and be able to communicate it to their seller
[00:14:00] simply.
[00:14:01] And whether the list agent knows or not, I'm going to have a, you know, better space in their head.
[00:14:07] Like, oh, I want to work with this person.
[00:14:09] That was very clear.
[00:14:09] That was so you created like a separate page.
[00:14:12] That's just a bullet point.
[00:14:13] In an email, we're saying, you know, hey, DJ, thank you so much for showing.
[00:14:17] I'd like to present the offer terms.
[00:14:20] And then you have the offer terms and I'm literally bullet pointing a B C D list price
[00:14:25] mortgage terms, earn us money.
[00:14:27] If it's as is a appraisal gap waiver, et cetera.
[00:14:30] So before they even get to the document.
[00:14:32] Yeah.
[00:14:32] And then I have all of the documents, but I've already summarized it for you.
[00:14:35] So if you were, you know, what people are doing now in a multiple offer situation
[00:14:38] if they're on the list side, they have a spreadsheet and like here are other terms
[00:14:41] so that they can line it up side by side.
[00:14:44] But more.
[00:14:45] Okay.
[00:14:45] So then you have, so we've already set the buyer's expectations.
[00:14:49] We've explained that there's an offer package and exactly how much or exactly what they need to do to win it.
[00:14:55] And then I think the third biggest thing is I'll tell you a story.
[00:14:59] You know, I've been on the list side where I've received multiple offers.
[00:15:03] I'm going to just make some assumptions.
[00:15:05] Let's say I in the hundred offers, let's call it the 500 offers I received last year
[00:15:13] across every single property we listed.
[00:15:16] How many times did I, what percentage of the time did I hear from the buyer's agent
[00:15:22] or a text or call?
[00:15:24] I would assume so you get the email.
[00:15:26] They're going to send the email with the offer.
[00:15:29] I'm curious before we get to that, I am curious how many people even do a bullet point list in the email.
[00:15:36] What percentage?
[00:15:37] Here's the, no, most of the time it's here's the offer attached.
[00:15:40] Yeah, here's the PDF.
[00:15:41] Yeah.
[00:15:42] OK, so now we're getting that.
[00:15:44] So almost no one's doing that.
[00:15:44] I don't actually care about, I care about that.
[00:15:48] I think you should be presenting it in a beautiful way.
[00:15:51] 
[00:15:52] OK, so now we get to who's communicating with me is the buyer actually reaching out to the seller and
[00:15:57] buyers agent reaching out to the seller's agent.
[00:15:59] Sorry, yeah, buyers.
[00:16:00] So what percentage I would assume in a competitive environment, which last year it was,
[00:16:06] I would say a third.
[00:16:08] Yeah, oh, yeah, 20.
[00:16:10] I was going to say a quarter and I'm shooting from the head.
[00:16:12] Why isn't it 100% I don't know why and I'm telling you,
[00:16:16] I want to work with people who are excited about their job.
[00:16:22] Yeah.
[00:16:22] And who want to win for their buyer?
[00:16:26] Because if they're just going to limp in, guess what?
[00:16:28] They're going to limp it through inspection.
[00:16:29] They're going to limp it through attorney review.
[00:16:31] They're going to let they don't care.
[00:16:33] I want to have someone who's engaged with me a cooperating broker
[00:16:37] so that we can get to the finish line together that our expectations are on the,
[00:16:41] you know, we're on the same page throughout this entire transaction.
[00:16:45] Frankly, someone I like, you're going to be in bed with this other agent for typically 30 or 45 days.
[00:16:50] I want to enjoy my effing life.
[00:16:52] Probably a good idea to make nice with them and also to develop a relationship.
[00:16:56] So what is that call look like?
[00:16:58] What are some best practices?
[00:17:00] You know, it's as simple as I think there needs to be two conversations with the other agent minimum.
[00:17:05] Of course you're there with a showing, you know, I think that's a really good chance.
[00:17:10] Like, hey, I've never done a deal with you before.
[00:17:12] My name has been, you know, we're likely going to offer what's important to your,
[00:17:16] you know, what's important to your seller.
[00:17:17] I think that conversation needs to occur in person if possible.
[00:17:20] Set that aside.
[00:17:22] If your buyer does want to offer, I think then it's a call and say, hey, DJ,
[00:17:27] I don't know if you remember me.
[00:17:28] My name is Ben.
[00:17:29] I was there with the husband, wife and two kids.
[00:17:32] And my buyers really love this property.
[00:17:34] Can you tell me anything that's super important to your seller so that I can, you know,
[00:17:37] create a compelling offer package for them?
[00:17:40] Right.
[00:17:41] And, you know, I'm going to try and pry.
[00:17:44] I'm not afraid to say, hey, what's it going to take to win this thing?
[00:17:46] Sure.
[00:17:47] Okay, cool. Done.
[00:17:48] Then once you offer, hey, DJ, I just wanted to let you know that the offers in, you know,
[00:17:53] in your inbox were really excited about doing this deal with you.
[00:17:57] Let me know if there's anything that I need to tweak.
[00:18:01] I know it's multiple offer situation, but I'm sorry, DJ.
[00:18:04] I'm probably going to call you, you know, probably 30 minutes before the deadline.
[00:18:08] I'm going to ask the question, hey, what does it take?
[00:18:11] That's how bad I want this for my buyer.
[00:18:13] And I want to show you just how eager I am to get this to the closing table with you.
[00:18:18] Nobody's going to be able to get this to the closing table quite like me.
[00:18:21] What percentage of agents do you think on that are representing buyers have that exact sort of
[00:18:26] energy when they bring in like you are on the list side a lot.
[00:18:30] So how often do you get that?
[00:18:31] We're on the by I mean, we're on the by side still more often.
[00:18:33] Yeah.
[00:18:35] I'm not getting that call rarely.
[00:18:37] Yeah, it's rare.
[00:18:39] It's super rare.
[00:18:40] And when I'm on a list side and I get that call from a buyer.
[00:18:44] Well, I'm like, oh, thank God someone has coached this person.
[00:18:49] Someone gives a shit.
[00:18:49] Yeah, somebody cares.
[00:18:50] I want to work with that person.
[00:18:53] And, you know, I actually hate when the other, you know, there's an offer just in a PDF
[00:18:57] and no communication and it's better.
[00:19:00] Yeah, I hate it.
[00:19:01] I don't want to work with this person.
[00:19:03] Yeah.
[00:19:04] I know that they aren't doing they haven't coached their buyer the right way.
[00:19:09] They haven't been coached as an agent themselves.
[00:19:12] And now I'm going to have to be doing just more work.
[00:19:15] It's just going to be harder for me.
[00:19:17] I'll tell you story.
[00:19:17] I was I was in a jury.
[00:19:20] I was actually the the what do they call the person who actually is a charge of the jury.
[00:19:24] The four person or I think that's right.
[00:19:25] Whatever it is.
[00:19:26] And I was I was on this case.
[00:19:28] It was a really simple
[00:19:31] insurance thing.
[00:19:32] It was an accident.
[00:19:32] It was really the details are important.
[00:19:35] But it was a very clear cut case.
[00:19:37] And one of the attorneys was really disagreeable and not likeable.
[00:19:41] And that was the one representing the insurance company who was clearly in the right.
[00:19:44] Then the defense attorney or the I guess defense.
[00:19:48] The was this was just really bubbly, you know, young, younger woman.
[00:19:53] She was kind.
[00:19:54] She was nice.
[00:19:54] She could tell she was a good human being.
[00:19:56] And she had a losing case and she wasn't going to win.
[00:19:59] And so we went into the jury, the deliberation room.
[00:20:02] And we had to find for the insurance company.
[00:20:05] But you could see in all of us like we liked her better.
[00:20:09] Yeah.
[00:20:09] And so when we got to it, you know, we had to sort of say we were looking for reasons to let her win.
[00:20:15] But she couldn't win because we had to do our job.
[00:20:17] But it was it was a true hurdle that we had to get over, which was funny.
[00:20:21] Because I would just think, oh, I'll be perfectly logical.
[00:20:23] I won't even care about who's presenting the information.
[00:20:26] But it does matter who's presenting the information.
[00:20:28] So this is actually a really great point that people just
[00:20:30] find there's a different energy to when somebody's really excited and eager and is like literally on top of things.
[00:20:37] And you know, I wish somebody was in my ear when I was younger.
[00:20:40] I have frankly, I've made enemies with other agents because I didn't know what I was doing when I was younger.
[00:20:45] And you know, as I'm learning, it took a really long time to become, you know,
[00:20:48] we're the number 17 in the entire city.
[00:20:51] Took a long time to get there and to learn how important the relationships with other agents are.
[00:20:55] But, you know, I cracked a few eggs to get here, unfortunately.
[00:20:59] And I wish, hey, I'm, if you're watching, I'm sorry.
[00:21:02] I didn't mean it. I didn't know any better.
[00:21:04] And, you know, that's why you need a coach or someone to steer you.
[00:21:07] So, you know, I don't know how much time we have left, but let's wrap it up.
[00:21:10] It's expectation setting.
[00:21:12] It is making sure that the offer package is tight and explaining to your buyer what
[00:21:17] you should be offering.
[00:21:20] And then the third thing is making sure that you have crystal clear high quality
[00:21:24] communication with the seller's agent.
[00:21:26] If you do those three things, the likelihood of your offer getting accepted increases.
[00:21:31] I mean, dramatically.
[00:21:33] And we're not talking about texting your, your, maybe you can text as in as,
[00:21:37] but we're talking about lots of phone calls.
[00:21:39] We're talking about calling the other listing agent, hey, want to make sure you receive this.
[00:21:43] We're really excited.
[00:21:44] Maybe sending a text as well.
[00:21:45] How often are, you know, because a lot of times buyers, ages go, I don't want to bother
[00:21:49] the list agent. They're getting all these multiple offers.
[00:21:51] I don't want to be annoying.
[00:21:52] What do you think?
[00:21:53] Well, I think just by definition of what like we just, it's not happening.
[00:21:57] Right.
[00:21:58] It's not happening.
[00:21:59] I'm telling you, like we have, we have these.
[00:22:02] I have multiple offers right now.
[00:22:05] Nobody's called.
[00:22:05] We have four offers.
[00:22:06] Nobody's called.
[00:22:07] That's crazy.
[00:22:08] Is it?
[00:22:09] It's apparently the norm.
[00:22:11] Well, they say it's never crowded along the extra mile, right?
[00:22:13] Yeah, exactly.
[00:22:14] Yeah.
[00:22:15] I want to, and I don't know, like I don't want to have a conversation with Matt Larersey.
[00:22:19] Then like, like bug his ass, but he wants that call.
[00:22:23] Sure.
[00:22:23] He wants that call.
[00:22:24] You want that call?
[00:22:25] Yeah.
[00:22:25] I want to make sure that the, my counterpart is ready to get this to the closing table.
[00:22:30] I tell this to sellers all the time.
[00:22:31] It doesn't matter if somebody goes 500 K over ask if they can't get to the closing table.
[00:22:36] Right.
[00:22:37] Right.
[00:22:37] And you want to have a buyer who, who has an agent that can get to the closing table.
[00:22:42] And this is, I think, the problem now, we, we hear a little bit more as we're getting these buyers
[00:22:47] representation of human sign.
[00:22:49] I could represent myself.
[00:22:50] I could represent myself.
[00:22:51] Sure.
[00:22:51] Yeah, you can.
[00:22:52] But the sellers agent and the seller, they don't want to work with you because the perception is that the likelihood
[00:23:01] of you getting to the closing table, I would argue it's half.
[00:23:05] That's my perception.
[00:23:07] Yeah.
[00:23:08] Because they don't, there's a process.
[00:23:10] And there's a, you know, a status quo of how a transaction should go.
[00:23:16] And they just don't know that status quo.
[00:23:19] Yeah, I love that.
[00:23:20] You know, you're really sort of changing the, the paradigm, or there's a paradigm shift here, which has been going on for a long time.
[00:23:26] But a lot of agents have been slow to adopt, which is the buyers agents really aren't there to find the property.
[00:23:31] Like the client can find the property.
[00:23:33] Right.
[00:23:34] The MLS is everywhere.
[00:23:35] It's not under lock and key anymore.
[00:23:37] It's, it's still important, of course, that the buyers agent listens and knows what they're looking for and presents great ideas.
[00:23:42] Yes.
[00:23:42] But I would assume, and I'm curious too, how often does a buyer come to one of your team members or yourself with already a list of properties they want to go see?
[00:23:52] Is it like half or more than half?
[00:23:54] Let me tell you a story that's a microcosm of everything we're talking about.
[00:23:59] We have this client and they were very upfront with me.
[00:24:02] They want to, I'm going to list their home after they go out and find a property on their own.
[00:24:08] Yeah.
[00:24:08] And I was like, no problem.
[00:24:10] I'm here for you.
[00:24:11] You let me know if I can help you on the buy side in any way.
[00:24:13] They go off for three months.
[00:24:15] They don't ask you for any help at all.
[00:24:17] No, they're like, we got this.
[00:24:19] We got this.
[00:24:19] And we have a little, and honestly, they're smart people.
[00:24:22] They're really smart.
[00:24:23] And if there's ever buyers that I thought could get it done, I'm like, yeah, I understand that that's something that you want to do.
[00:24:29] You want to save this two and a half percent of your head go for it.
[00:24:33] Three months go by and I get a call and they're like, we've offered on properties.
[00:24:39] Like we had our attorney drafted up.
[00:24:41] I, the consumer sent it to the list agent.
[00:24:44] I just don't get a call back.
[00:24:46] I don't get any communication.
[00:24:47] I'm like, yeah, I'm not surprised.
[00:24:50] Your offer A probably wasn't good enough.
[00:24:52] Like, be the perception is that you're not you're doing or yeah, you may think you know what you're doing.
[00:24:59] But there's nuance here and how think how it goes down.
[00:25:02] Okay.
[00:25:03] So what happens?
[00:25:03] Hey, Ben, come over to me.
[00:25:06] I already have this house and I know it's going to go multiple offers.
[00:25:10] Happens to be a friend of mine who's the list agent.
[00:25:13] Sure.
[00:25:14] And this is in Highland Park.
[00:25:18] Hey, friend, what's it going to take?
[00:25:20] This is what it's going to take Ben.
[00:25:21] I'm like, all right, cool.
[00:25:23] I'm going to get it.
[00:25:23] I'm going to get it over to you as soon as my clients give me the indication that this is the property.
[00:25:27] Sound good?
[00:25:28] Cool.
[00:25:28] I'll let you know what what it's going to take if it's close under contract.
[00:25:32] Awesome.
[00:25:33] And that is everything that I just expressed to you.
[00:25:36] So when my client called me, I'm like, okay, let's sit down.
[00:25:38] I'm going to tell you exactly how this is going to go.
[00:25:40] All right, cool.
[00:25:41] This is how it's going to go.
[00:25:42] Number two, I'm going to tell you this is what it's going to take to win.
[00:25:46] What's off for that?
[00:25:47] You know, they agreed with me.
[00:25:49] We offered three.
[00:25:50] I have a really great relationship with this agent.
[00:25:53] I'm a Heyman.
[00:25:54] I'm going to get this to the closing table.
[00:25:55] Come hell or high water.
[00:25:56] If not, we're going to have a conversation about why, but my clients are educated.
[00:26:01] And we're going to get the closing table together.
[00:26:03] Let's do it.
[00:26:03] And they're under contract.
[00:26:04] And we didn't even talk about making sure that the lending partner is the right partner to.
[00:26:08] That's also something super important because people can shop for rates online and find really
[00:26:13] impressive rates that may not be backed by a company that can get to the closing line as easily
[00:26:18] as somebody locally who's there.
[00:26:22] You have to have a team.
[00:26:23] 
[00:26:23] Yeah, we have a we have three or four lenders that we've just vetted over 12 years.
[00:26:28] Attorneys, you know who gets deals closed.
[00:26:30] Yeah, let's get him like for an attorney.
[00:26:33] We're not trying to like hide anything from our buyers or sellers, but there are certain things that just aren't a big deal.
[00:26:38] There's a bedside manner that needs to be followed.
[00:26:41] And the lender, not all lenders are created equal.
[00:26:46] Go get us the money.
[00:26:47] That's your only job.
[00:26:49] Now, don't put us in a product that is shitty.
[00:26:53] But get us to the closing table and the same thing with it.
[00:26:56] I mean, inspectors are the worst.
[00:26:57] Like you have an alarmist.
[00:26:59] It's not the inspector's job to tell your client to buy or not buy the property.
[00:27:05] I can't tell you how many times I've had an inspector in the past like, oh, this property.
[00:27:09] And I would never touch this thing.
[00:27:11] So, okay, cool.
[00:27:12] Your job to tell me what's wrong with it.
[00:27:14] I'll go get this.
[00:27:15] If it needs 75 grand, I'll go get the 75 grand for my clients.
[00:27:20] Stay in your lane inspector.
[00:27:22] Yeah.
[00:27:22] Right. So those are the inspectors.
[00:27:23] We don't want alarmists.
[00:27:24] We want people who are going to point out everything and shine a light on everything that's wrong.
[00:27:29] And that's it.
[00:27:31] It's our job and the attorneys job to talk through repairs and credits.
[00:27:34] Stay in your lane.
[00:27:35] I think this is really a great, great episode.
[00:27:37] I think hopefully our audience is paying attention or listening for one of the top teams here in Chicago.
[00:27:43] One of the top markets in the country.
[00:27:45] Ben is one of the top teams in the top one of the top markets.
[00:27:48] And he knows what he's doing.
[00:27:49] He is, by the way, always looking for agents as well who might be able to bring value to his team.
[00:27:54] And he can do vice versa with you.
[00:27:57] So if you're an agent, you're looking to join a team or maybe you're not getting the attention you need from your existing team or existing firm.
[00:28:03] Ben, what's the best way an agent should reach out to you?
[00:28:05] I always say if you can't find me, I did a really horrible job marketing myself.
[00:28:10] So you can find me.
[00:28:11] Ben Lala's team on Instagram and BenLala's.com.
[00:28:15] That's right.
[00:28:15] Is the website.
[00:28:16] And also too, we have lots of listeners who are not in the Chicago and area.
[00:28:20] In fact, most of our audience is not here.
[00:28:22] So if you have people that are moving to and from the Chicago area, Ben and his team would love to have conversation with you because not only do those go one way, they also people,
[00:28:31] people don't often retire in Chicago.
[00:28:33] They leave Chicago and they go somewhere warmer.
[00:28:35] So if you are in one of those markets that are fed from Chicago when people get second homes or vacation properties or just retirement
[00:28:42] retirement situations reach out to Ben and he has people he needs to refer as well.
[00:28:47] That's right. Thank you, DJ.
[00:28:48] Thank you.
[00:28:49] And for everyone listening, really appreciate, please check out our sponsors.
[00:28:52] They're the reason we can keep doing our show.
[00:28:54] We love our sponsors and we love all of our listeners for making it all the way to the end of the episode.
[00:28:59] We just asked for two quick things, one tele-friend.
[00:29:02] Think of one other agent that needs to hear what Ben just,
[00:29:04] just gave you a great recipe for winning in multiple offer situation.
[00:29:08] Do him a favor and send and do us a favor.
[00:29:11] Send this podcast link out to someone else in your office that could really hear this information for
[00:29:16] and maybe not even the first time.
[00:29:18] Maybe they need a refresher.
[00:29:19] This is a great refresher.
[00:29:20] Send it to them and then also leave us a review wherever you're listening to this episode or watching it.
[00:29:25] Let us know what you think of the show, whether it's Apple podcast, Spotify, wherever.
[00:29:29] Let us know.
[00:29:30] Leave us a review and we read those and we make changes based on your suggestions.
[00:29:34] And with that being said, thank you, Ben.
[00:29:37] On behalf of the audience and on behalf of Ben and myself, thank you to the audience.
[00:29:40] We will see everybody on the next episode.
[00:29:43] Thanks.
[00:29:43] See you next month.

And now on to our show. Today's episode is brought to you by corded.io. Are you looking for agents to join your brokerage or team? Now, as a real estate recruiter, I can tell you the answer is always yes. But most agents aren't looking to move right now. So how do you know who to contact? Well, what if I were to tell you there's a recruiting and retention tool powered by artificial intelligence that shows you exactly which agents in your local market are looking to leave their brokerage right now and which agents at your own firm are also looking to leave you. Now, I've been recruiting REALTORS for 15 years and I've hired over 2000 agents. I can tell you with no exaggeration. This is the tool I've been waiting for. Corded's AI looks for trends across dozens of variables for each agent in your market and shows you which agents they believe are likely to move. Not only does it do that, but corded's AI went and visited my recruiting website and read everything I offer. So now when I'm recruiting, corded's AI tells me exactly what to say based on that agent's needs and what my brokerage can offer. It even writes emails for me. I've never seen anything like it and I use it every single day. Now, if you are looking to grow your brokerage, corded.io is the best tool out there. Visit corded.io to schedule a demo again. That's corded.io and now onto the show. Welcome to keeping it real. The largest podcast made by real estate agents and four real estate agents. My name's DJ Paris. I am your guide and host through the show. And in just a moment, we're going to be speaking with Ben Lales. We have our special episode, our monthly episode called Better Business with Ben. Well, let me tell you about Ben. Ben Lales is a Chicago real estate agent with Compass. He is the founder and the owner of the Ben Lales team. And they have dozens and dozens of agents here in Chicago serving all of Chicago. And Ben is one of the very top teams in all of Chicago out of 46,000 agents. He's in the top two or three teams, amazing producer, top one per center. And really a visionary, somebody who is really a thought leader in this space. And I'm excited to have you on again, Ben. Yeah, thank you. And thank you for coming to my neck of the woods. Yeah. And let's promote something for you. So where would we want Ben Lales team on Instagram? And what is your website, I think, is particularly interesting. I'd like our agents and our viewers and our listeners to check it out. Because you did something very against type with your website, which is you pulled a lot of stuff out. And you made it very simple, but very clean and very unique. And I think it's really effective. Yeah, we want people to come and like, if you're a buyer or a seller, just hit one button. And like, not be confused at all about where to go. So yeah, we built it ourselves. We're not particularly proud of it. But now I'm proud of it because you just typed it up. I like it. It's really clean. The colors are really simple. And I love the fact that again, it's just like, don't make me think. And I like the fact that again, against trend, you pulled off the home search. And I and believe me, I totally understand why you do it. We have this argument in our company all the time. Do we want the home search or not? And it doesn't do us any good. But people, I guess maybe they like to see it, but they don't use it. It's an SEO play, isn't it? Isn't it about, it's about like index pages and keywords on site keywords. Does not help us at all. Yeah. I mean, no, I don't know how many we do have it kind of hidden. Yeah. But like, I don't know how many people have actually ever set up a search on them. They've got Zelo. They don't need you. They've got other places. Yeah. Yeah. All right. So we, you know, Ben comes on every month and he is somebody I look up to in this industry. He's always thinking far ahead. And yeah. And he's always got great ideas. So what do we want to talk about it? Well, I always like, actually, Ben and I were talking beforehand. We're trying to think what would be a great topic for today. And really, you know, I always like to solve problems. So we were thinking about what are some of the big challenges REALTOR's are facing right now across the country. Inventory seems to be a massive one. But we're not going to tackle inventories as much today. We're going to talk a little bit about what with the inventory that is out there. How do you win deals? Yeah. So we're going to talk about winning in multiple offer situations. We're, we, I am really lucky in that because we have, you know, 30 plus agents and we're one of the biggest buy side teams in the entire city and right, you know, we're ranked in the country now. Is we just have a ton of visibility over how many offers on, you know, on X number of properties. What is our win rate? What is our cancellation rate? And we just have a ton of data to show and support what is actually winning in these offers. We want to get into it. So here is, let's first identify the problem, I would say. So right now, as you've said, as there's a lack of inventory and depending in which sub market you're in in Chicago, you know, you're entering these situations or your, you know, our buyers are entering these situations where there's two, three, four, you know, just the other, you know, this last weekend, eight, ten offers. And the worst problem for a real estate agent is, right, you have spent, I don't know how much time, energy, money, sourcing this buyer and the time finally comes where they're like, Hey, DJ, Ben, you know, whatever you know, whoever you are, let's write an offer. And the worst thing is is losing. So not only do you, you know, not make the sale, your buyer doesn't get, get the property and you risk, honestly, got losing them because whether true or not, they're going to, they have to, they have to blame someone. And more often than not, there's only one person to blame. So the, that's a problem and the solution, I mean, we're going to talk about what the solution is, right? So there's a few things at play and I want to touch on three of them. The first one being is this all starts in our opinion with the buyer consultation and setting the expectation with your buyer around what the hell is going to happen in their home search. Yeah. I would argue that 95% of problems can be gotten out ahead of in a buyer consultation. And you know, we've been doing buyer consultations even before, you know, the big change in August, we didn't really get buyer agreement sign. But now you have to, you have to get a buyer consultation, I'm sorry, a buyer representation agreement sign anyway. So let's do it in a formal setting. Let's sit here face to face. And what your job is as a real estate agent is to explain the process. This is how it's going to go. And then also depending on the market, the sub market that your buyer is looking in. Hey, this is what you can't expect when we offer on a property. Don't be surprised when it's a multiple offer situation. And I come to you and, you know, say these words as is a, you know, appraisal gap waiver. And you need to, you know, put these ideas in your buyer's head on the front end. So that when the time comes, they're not resistant to you. Are you going into really specifics about what is an appraisal gap? You know, what is it as is clause? You're going in and saying, OK, so just so you know, if this happens, here's how to interpret it. Here's what we'll do as a result. Yep. So our buyer consultations are like an hour and a half and we try to go into as much detail as possible, especially in a competitive environment. For I don't want to waste my time. I don't want my agents to waste their time. I don't want the buyers to waste their time. And I don't want the, you know, it's just if you're not setting expectations appropriately with your buyers, you're killing them and you're killing yourself. So yeah, we go into everything. We go into everything we talk about what as is means on paper. But more importantly, what it actually means in context, there's a huge fallacy, especially here in Chicago buyers think that they can't perform an inspection or they can't ask for credits or repairs. And on paper, yeah, you're not supposed to ask for credit or repairs. But depending on your relationship with the other agent and that's something that we're going to get into, that's the second thing. You can still ask there's what is on paper and what is in practice. And that's something that we express to our buyers. So that's as is we express what actually matters in the appraisal gap waiver so that they they understand what's going on. Anyway, so that's the whole, you know, buyer. So yeah, I want to get clear. So you're having this conversation with the buyer before ever seeing a property. Yes, God you and that's a, that's got to be a change. So in the past, a lot of times the, the school of thought was if they know what they want to go see, go show them that first. And then you know, get them, get them to the property and then have that explanation of that conversation. You're doing that now before. Yeah. So and I'm also, when you have to with commissions now, well, you have to, but I'm also leaving a whole other part. I'm talking about how to win a multiple offers and you have to expectation. Sure. There's a whole host of other benefits to doing this, like making sure they can actually qualify, getting them in touch with a lender, etc. It's just, it's the most important thing. You're saving yourself so much time and you're increasing your odds of transacting with this person when you get in a room and you explain to them a few things. Hey, this process is hard, right? B, you need me and see I'm an expert and we always say like it's a scary process and you want to be the person who's the voice of reason and to calm those fears. And it's really competitive right now. Yeah. So let's get into competition and then what we try to express to buyers and is two things. One, I, we try to get this across. I, my job is to tell you what it's going to take to win on this property. I don't really like, I'm not going to say care if you win or not, but my job is to do a few things. That is to have a really great relationship with the other agents. Yeah. Really understand the market and say, hey, I, I am certain. Like I, I try to give probabilities. If you come in at price X, you have a 98% certainty of winning this. If you come in at why it drops to 90, if you come in at Z, it drops to 80%. Here's the information. I suggest if you want to win this property, here are the offer terms. So what I'm talking about is I am telling the buyer what to do. I'm not asking for their opinion. I'm the expert, right? And with that, you have to be able to understand two things is when you're offering in a multiple offer situation, yeah, your needs and wants matter, but you have to ask the question of the list agent, pay what is important to your seller. Of course, it's going to be money. But oftentimes they, you know, they're coming to the transaction with whatever baggage they have. Sure. Maybe they've gotten bitten the past with a bad mortgage, maybe close data, super important. Maybe they've got kids in school and they need to wait it out till August. Maybe they need a rent back, but you really need to become extremely clear on what's important to the seller so that you can develop an offer package. It's not just price and offer package that's super compelling to the seller. And when you send an offer, you know, we're talking about asking the buyer, the seller's agent to give you an idea of what they're looking for, what their concerns are. And even sort of what their avatar is of the perfect buyer, right? You want to know like, is it a family? Is it an individual? Of course, you know, we want to respect all the laws and make sure that we're doing this. But the idea is we want to know what they are inclined to be excited about, I guess. And my question is, so now that we know, okay, we have a somewhat of a recipe for what we think they're looking for, I'm curious about the pure aesthetics of sending in the offer. Is there anything that you recommend people do to do, to jujup the actual physical document that will not electronic, of course. But what are we doing to make it at least look a little different from everyone? It's really funny. You said you said that. I just had this conversation right before coming in where someone is offering. And I, I'm a little bit crazy. I want to make it as easy as possible for the seller's agent to actually read. Yeah. Like bullet points and bolds and, you know, make it really, really simple. Like it's essentially an outline of the offer terms, right? And I want them to be able to discern it very quickly and be able to communicate it to their seller simply. And whether the list agent knows or not, I'm going to have a, you know, better space in their head. Like, oh, I want to work with this person. That was very clear. That was so you created like a separate page. That's just a bullet point. In an email, we're saying, you know, hey, DJ, thank you so much for showing. I'd like to present the offer terms. And then you have the offer terms and I'm literally bullet pointing a B C D list price mortgage terms, earn us money. If it's as is a appraisal gap waiver, et cetera. So before they even get to the document. Yeah. And then I have all of the documents, but I've already summarized it for you. So if you were, you know, what people are doing now in a multiple offer situation if they're on the list side, they have a spreadsheet and like here are other terms so that they can line it up side by side. But more. Okay. So then you have, so we've already set the buyer's expectations. We've explained that there's an offer package and exactly how much or exactly what they need to do to win it. And then I think the third biggest thing is I'll tell you a story. You know, I've been on the list side where I've received multiple offers. I'm going to just make some assumptions. Let's say I in the hundred offers, let's call it the 500 offers I received last year across every single property we listed. How many times did I, what percentage of the time did I hear from the buyer's agent or a text or call? I would assume so you get the email. They're going to send the email with the offer. I'm curious before we get to that, I am curious how many people even do a bullet point list in the email. What percentage? Here's the, no, most of the time it's here's the offer attached. Yeah, here's the PDF. Yeah. OK, so now we're getting that. So almost no one's doing that. I don't actually care about, I care about that. I think you should be presenting it in a beautiful way. OK, so now we get to who's communicating with me is the buyer actually reaching out to the seller and buyers agent reaching out to the seller's agent. Sorry, yeah, buyers. So what percentage I would assume in a competitive environment, which last year it was, I would say a third. Yeah, oh, yeah, 20. I was going to say a quarter and I'm shooting from the head. Why isn't it 100% I don't know why and I'm telling you, I want to work with people who are excited about their job. Yeah. And who want to win for their buyer? Because if they're just going to limp in, guess what? They're going to limp it through inspection. They're going to limp it through attorney review. They're going to let they don't care. I want to have someone who's engaged with me a cooperating broker so that we can get to the finish line together that our expectations are on the, you know, we're on the same page throughout this entire transaction. Frankly, someone I like, you're going to be in bed with this other agent for typically 30 or 45 days. I want to enjoy my effing life. Probably a good idea to make nice with them and also to develop a relationship. So what is that call look like? What are some best practices? You know, it's as simple as I think there needs to be two conversations with the other agent minimum. Of course you're there with a showing, you know, I think that's a really good chance. Like, hey, I've never done a deal with you before. My name has been, you know, we're likely going to offer what's important to your, you know, what's important to your seller. I think that conversation needs to occur in person if possible. Set that aside. If your buyer does want to offer, I think then it's a call and say, hey, DJ, I don't know if you remember me. My name is Ben. I was there with the husband, wife and two kids. And my buyers really love this property. Can you tell me anything that's super important to your seller so that I can, you know, create a compelling offer package for them? Right. And, you know, I'm going to try and pry. I'm not afraid to say, hey, what's it going to take to win this thing? Sure. Okay, cool. Done. Then once you offer, hey, DJ, I just wanted to let you know that the offers in, you know, in your inbox were really excited about doing this deal with you. Let me know if there's anything that I need to tweak. I know it's multiple offer situation, but I'm sorry, DJ. I'm probably going to call you, you know, probably 30 minutes before the deadline. I'm going to ask the question, hey, what does it take? That's how bad I want this for my buyer. And I want to show you just how eager I am to get this to the closing table with you. Nobody's going to be able to get this to the closing table quite like me. What percentage of agents do you think on that are representing buyers have that exact sort of energy when they bring in like you are on the list side a lot. So how often do you get that? We're on the by I mean, we're on the by side still more often. Yeah. I'm not getting that call rarely. Yeah, it's rare. It's super rare. And when I'm on a list side and I get that call from a buyer. Well, I'm like, oh, thank God someone has coached this person. Someone gives a shit. Yeah, somebody cares. I want to work with that person. And, you know, I actually hate when the other, you know, there's an offer just in a PDF and no communication and it's better. Yeah, I hate it. I don't want to work with this person. Yeah. I know that they aren't doing they haven't coached their buyer the right way. They haven't been coached as an agent themselves. And now I'm going to have to be doing just more work. It's just going to be harder for me. I'll tell you story. I was I was in a jury. I was actually the the what do they call the person who actually is a charge of the jury. The four person or I think that's right. Whatever it is. And I was I was on this case. It was a really simple insurance thing. It was an accident. It was really the details are important. But it was a very clear cut case. And one of the attorneys was really disagreeable and not likeable. And that was the one representing the insurance company who was clearly in the right. Then the defense attorney or the I guess defense. The was this was just really bubbly, you know, young, younger woman. She was kind. She was nice. She could tell she was a good human being. And she had a losing case and she wasn't going to win. And so we went into the jury, the deliberation room. And we had to find for the insurance company. But you could see in all of us like we liked her better. Yeah. And so when we got to it, you know, we had to sort of say we were looking for reasons to let her win. But she couldn't win because we had to do our job. But it was it was a true hurdle that we had to get over, which was funny. Because I would just think, oh, I'll be perfectly logical. I won't even care about who's presenting the information. But it does matter who's presenting the information. So this is actually a really great point that people just find there's a different energy to when somebody's really excited and eager and is like literally on top of things. And you know, I wish somebody was in my ear when I was younger. I have frankly, I've made enemies with other agents because I didn't know what I was doing when I was younger. And you know, as I'm learning, it took a really long time to become, you know, we're the number 17 in the entire city. Took a long time to get there and to learn how important the relationships with other agents are. But, you know, I cracked a few eggs to get here, unfortunately. And I wish, hey, I'm, if you're watching, I'm sorry. I didn't mean it. I didn't know any better. And, you know, that's why you need a coach or someone to steer you. So, you know, I don't know how much time we have left, but let's wrap it up. It's expectation setting. It is making sure that the offer package is tight and explaining to your buyer what you should be offering. And then the third thing is making sure that you have crystal clear high quality communication with the seller's agent. If you do those three things, the likelihood of your offer getting accepted increases. I mean, dramatically. And we're not talking about texting your, your, maybe you can text as in as, but we're talking about lots of phone calls. We're talking about calling the other listing agent, hey, want to make sure you receive this. We're really excited. Maybe sending a text as well. How often are, you know, because a lot of times buyers, ages go, I don't want to bother the list agent. They're getting all these multiple offers. I don't want to be annoying. What do you think? Well, I think just by definition of what like we just, it's not happening. Right. It's not happening. I'm telling you, like we have, we have these. I have multiple offers right now. Nobody's called. We have four offers. Nobody's called. That's crazy. Is it? It's apparently the norm. Well, they say it's never crowded along the extra mile, right? Yeah, exactly. Yeah. I want to, and I don't know, like I don't want to have a conversation with Matt Larersey. Then like, like bug his ass, but he wants that call. Sure. He wants that call. You want that call? Yeah. I want to make sure that the, my counterpart is ready to get this to the closing table. I tell this to sellers all the time. It doesn't matter if somebody goes 500 K over ask if they can't get to the closing table. Right. Right. And you want to have a buyer who, who has an agent that can get to the closing table. And this is, I think, the problem now, we, we hear a little bit more as we're getting these buyers representation of human sign. I could represent myself. I could represent myself. Sure. Yeah, you can. But the sellers agent and the seller, they don't want to work with you because the perception is that the likelihood of you getting to the closing table, I would argue it's half. That's my perception. Yeah. Because they don't, there's a process. And there's a, you know, a status quo of how a transaction should go. And they just don't know that status quo. Yeah, I love that. You know, you're really sort of changing the, the paradigm, or there's a paradigm shift here, which has been going on for a long time. But a lot of agents have been slow to adopt, which is the buyers agents really aren't there to find the property. Like the client can find the property. Right. The MLS is everywhere. It's not under lock and key anymore. It's, it's still important, of course, that the buyers agent listens and knows what they're looking for and presents great ideas. Yes. But I would assume, and I'm curious too, how often does a buyer come to one of your team members or yourself with already a list of properties they want to go see? Is it like half or more than half? Let me tell you a story that's a microcosm of everything we're talking about. We have this client and they were very upfront with me. They want to, I'm going to list their home after they go out and find a property on their own. Yeah. And I was like, no problem. I'm here for you. You let me know if I can help you on the buy side in any way. They go off for three months. They don't ask you for any help at all. No, they're like, we got this. We got this. And we have a little, and honestly, they're smart people. They're really smart. And if there's ever buyers that I thought could get it done, I'm like, yeah, I understand that that's something that you want to do. You want to save this two and a half percent of your head go for it. Three months go by and I get a call and they're like, we've offered on properties. Like we had our attorney drafted up. I, the consumer sent it to the list agent. I just don't get a call back. I don't get any communication. I'm like, yeah, I'm not surprised. Your offer A probably wasn't good enough. Like, be the perception is that you're not you're doing or yeah, you may think you know what you're doing. But there's nuance here and how think how it goes down. Okay. So what happens? Hey, Ben, come over to me. I already have this house and I know it's going to go multiple offers. Happens to be a friend of mine who's the list agent. Sure. And this is in Highland Park. Hey, friend, what's it going to take? This is what it's going to take Ben. I'm like, all right, cool. I'm going to get it. I'm going to get it over to you as soon as my clients give me the indication that this is the property. Sound good? Cool. I'll let you know what what it's going to take if it's close under contract. Awesome. And that is everything that I just expressed to you. So when my client called me, I'm like, okay, let's sit down. I'm going to tell you exactly how this is going to go. All right, cool. This is how it's going to go. Number two, I'm going to tell you this is what it's going to take to win. What's off for that? You know, they agreed with me. We offered three. I have a really great relationship with this agent. I'm a Heyman. I'm going to get this to the closing table. Come hell or high water. If not, we're going to have a conversation about why, but my clients are educated. And we're going to get the closing table together. Let's do it. And they're under contract. And we didn't even talk about making sure that the lending partner is the right partner to. That's also something super important because people can shop for rates online and find really impressive rates that may not be backed by a company that can get to the closing line as easily as somebody locally who's there. You have to have a team. Yeah, we have a we have three or four lenders that we've just vetted over 12 years. Attorneys, you know who gets deals closed. Yeah, let's get him like for an attorney. We're not trying to like hide anything from our buyers or sellers, but there are certain things that just aren't a big deal. There's a bedside manner that needs to be followed. And the lender, not all lenders are created equal. Go get us the money. That's your only job. Now, don't put us in a product that is shitty. But get us to the closing table and the same thing with it. I mean, inspectors are the worst. Like you have an alarmist. It's not the inspector's job to tell your client to buy or not buy the property. I can't tell you how many times I've had an inspector in the past like, oh, this property. And I would never touch this thing. So, okay, cool. Your job to tell me what's wrong with it. I'll go get this. If it needs 75 grand, I'll go get the 75 grand for my clients. Stay in your lane inspector. Yeah. Right. So those are the inspectors. We don't want alarmists. We want people who are going to point out everything and shine a light on everything that's wrong. And that's it. It's our job and the attorneys job to talk through repairs and credits. Stay in your lane. I think this is really a great, great episode. I think hopefully our audience is paying attention or listening for one of the top teams here in Chicago. One of the top markets in the country. Ben is one of the top teams in the top one of the top markets. And he knows what he's doing. He is, by the way, always looking for agents as well who might be able to bring value to his team. And he can do vice versa with you. So if you're an agent, you're looking to join a team or maybe you're not getting the attention you need from your existing team or existing firm. Ben, what's the best way an agent should reach out to you? I always say if you can't find me, I did a really horrible job marketing myself. So you can find me. Ben Lala's team on Instagram and BenLala's.com. That's right. Is the website. And also too, we have lots of listeners who are not in the Chicago and area. In fact, most of our audience is not here. So if you have people that are moving to and from the Chicago area, Ben and his team would love to have conversation with you because not only do those go one way, they also people, people don't often retire in Chicago. They leave Chicago and they go somewhere warmer. So if you are in one of those markets that are fed from Chicago when people get second homes or vacation properties or just retirement retirement situations reach out to Ben and he has people he needs to refer as well. That's right. Thank you, DJ. Thank you. And for everyone listening, really appreciate, please check out our sponsors. They're the reason we can keep doing our show. We love our sponsors and we love all of our listeners for making it all the way to the end of the episode. We just asked for two quick things, one tele-friend. Think of one other agent that needs to hear what Ben just, just gave you a great recipe for winning in multiple offer situation. Do him a favor and send and do us a favor. Send this podcast link out to someone else in your office that could really hear this information for and maybe not even the first time. Maybe they need a refresher. This is a great refresher. Send it to them and then also leave us a review wherever you're listening to this episode or watching it. Let us know what you think of the show, whether it's Apple podcast, Spotify, wherever. Let us know. Leave us a review and we read those and we make changes based on your suggestions. And with that being said, thank you, Ben. On behalf of the audience and on behalf of Ben and myself, thank you to the audience. We will see everybody on the next episode. Thanks. See you next month.
