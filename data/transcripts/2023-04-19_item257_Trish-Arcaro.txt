[00:04:15] Trish, welcome to the show.
[00:04:17] Thank you for having me, D.J. Paris.
[00:04:19] This is amazing.
[00:04:21] We were both just laughing because Trish's last name is Italian.
[00:04:25] She goes, I'm not really Italian.
[00:04:26] I said, well, my last name is Paris and I'm not French.
[00:04:29] Go figure.
[00:04:29] But I'm glad we're talking to people with unusual last names that don't match their ethnicities.
[00:04:38] But I would love to learn a little bit more about you and tell our exposure audience
[00:04:43] to your way of doing business.
[00:04:46] I'm really excited to chat with you.
[00:04:48] I love the fact that I think in real estate, a lot of times people don't have enough fun
[00:04:56] in the sense of the things that may be thought to be not as aligned with real estate.
[00:05:04] So in real estate, we like to think, oh, the headshot needs to look perfect.
[00:05:08] I need to be more conservative and buttoned up and just a more traditional business stuffy
[00:05:16] kind of approach.
[00:05:17] And you are like, no, my authentic self is I am into some interesting cool things that
[00:05:23] are important to me.
[00:05:24] And I'm going to embed that into my business and I just love that.
[00:05:28] So nobody probably knows what yet what we're talking about.
[00:05:31] So I'm excited to get to that.
[00:05:32] But before we get to what you're doing today, I want to hear about how you got started.
[00:05:36] So tell us how you got into real estate.
[00:05:38] So I back in 2003 and 4, I was working as a receptionist for a salon and there was a hair stylist
[00:05:48] that does mortgages on the side.
[00:05:51] And I was like, how do you manage yourself doing mortgages and doing hair at the same time?
[00:05:56] I just don't even know how to do that.
[00:05:58] But that started, that scene was planted in my hand.
[00:06:02] I was like, oh, maybe I should try it in California.
[00:06:04] This was when I was in California.
[00:06:07] And fast-forwarded to 2014, I just jumped right in.
[00:06:12] There was an opportunity to be a marketing manager for a team,
[00:06:17] for real estate agency that I first started out in.
[00:06:21] And I grew with them and then somehow, it is so weird because the universe just kind of
[00:06:26] aligns you and connects with you, puts you in the right place at the right time.
[00:06:31] So the team that I was working for or working with,
[00:06:35] their family lives around the block from my parents' house in Los Angeles.
[00:06:39] It is so cool.
[00:06:40] I've never met them, yeah, never met them in my life before until I moved to Maine.
[00:06:44] And then they had California ties, Los Angeles ties, and so happens that they lived
[00:06:49] around the block from my parents' house. It's so weird.
[00:06:51] So weird. And now we've become with friends.
[00:06:54] And I've learned so much from starting out as a team member and then developing my own
[00:07:01] brand successfully on my own since I've left the team.
[00:07:05] So how did you go from West Coast to East Coast?
[00:07:08] You made a huge shift there.
[00:07:09] That was a quantum leap from me.
[00:07:11] So when we literally decided to move from California to make me and my husband and I,
[00:07:24] we don't want to raise our kids out here.
[00:07:26] We don't, you know, in LA, I want to say something different.
[00:07:29] So we decided to move closer to his family.
[00:07:34] And I've
[00:07:35] I've
[00:07:36] been up to everything to pick up and then move really.
[00:07:40] And then I started to real estate maybe six months to eight months later.
[00:07:46] And I just went on a
[00:07:48] leg and I barely had any there, like nothing.
[00:07:51] Sure.
[00:07:52] Well, I always know that there's something about,
[00:07:56] yeah, there's something about the idea of sort of having to make it work.
[00:08:00] Like for people that are, there's like a gift, like the gift of desperation in a sense and I'm
[00:08:06] not saying you were desperate.
[00:08:08] Yeah, not having a safety net is definitely like a huge risk.
[00:08:13] And but but I always find it in some ways like it sort of forces people to get really,
[00:08:18] really, you know, sort of in line with their goals.
[00:08:21] And and then they can, you know, when there's no other option,
[00:08:24] it's a lot of times you just figure out a way to make it work.
[00:08:27] Yeah, it was very.
[00:08:31] You know, scary, you know, when I know I feel like it's the right thing to do and there's
[00:08:36] something better on the other side once I get through this past this fear.
[00:08:40] And so, you know, moving from Los Angeles to Maine, just was the best
[00:08:45] as the entire family.
[00:08:46] My mom and dad bought a house out here, followed me and their grandkids out here to, yeah.
[00:08:52] So they have two properties, one in LA and then one here in Maine that I manage.
[00:08:58] Me and my husband take care of while they're gone and they go back and forth.
[00:09:01] So I mean, it's a whole win-win situation for all, you know,
[00:09:05] any mean it's all for the highest good.
[00:09:07] So it's for my family and my parents.
[00:09:09] Yeah, and I mean, that's amazing.
[00:09:11] And the culture is very different, right?
[00:09:13] So you were like Southern California and then you moved to sort of, you know,
[00:09:17] mid to northern parts of Maine.
[00:09:19] And people are different.
[00:09:21] Values are different.
[00:09:22] Everything's different.
[00:09:24] Everything is different.
[00:09:25] But the one thing I can say about Maine is out here when I first, they're so welcoming,
[00:09:29] so friendly.
[00:09:31] I stuck out, obviously, for, you know, coming from a...
[00:09:35] You're the West Coast granola girl.
[00:09:37] Yeah.
[00:09:37] 
[00:09:37] Yeah.
[00:09:38] So I was like, you know, coming from pine, like, you know, palm trees, the beach,
[00:09:43] to sandy, you know, tan all the time to like, to like pine trees and snow.
[00:09:48] Yeah.
[00:09:49] And then, you know, I'm not experiencing, I mean, there's a lot is that I
[00:09:55] since living here in Maine and I would never change.
[00:09:58] And it was like I said, it was just the best decision, best quantum leap decision that I've
[00:10:03] ever made in my whole entire life so far.
[00:10:06] So that was like, I love that.
[00:10:09] And now you, yeah, you get to see the, you get to see the colors change, you get to see the
[00:10:13] seasons, you get to eat a lot of lobster.
[00:10:15] There's, there's, there are some benefits to living in Maine.
[00:10:19] You're by the mountains, you're by the water.
[00:10:21] Oh, just everything.
[00:10:22] I just, it's such a, it's, everything.
[00:10:25] By the way, for anyone that has not seen the colors change in the northeast,
[00:10:29] starting around like September, October, if you've never done that, like I had, I had a friend who,
[00:10:36] I mean, there's one of those things that people told me for years, you got to see the colors
[00:10:39] change. And I was like, yeah, yeah, yeah, you know, whatever.
[00:10:41] Yeah.
[00:10:41] And then finally, I had a friend in Boston and she goes, you've never seen the colors change?
[00:10:45] And I'd been, I've been to almost all the states, not all of them, but there's like five or
[00:10:48] six I hadn't been to at that time.
[00:10:50] And those happen to be like New Hampshire, Vermont and Maine, where I still haven't been to Vermont.
[00:10:54] But New Hampshire and Maine, I had never been to.
[00:10:56] And she's like, oh, perfect.
[00:10:57] Flying to Boston and drive up.
[00:10:58] And I legitimately was just the whole entire weekend or however long I was there.
[00:11:04] I was, I was just constantly ping pong.
[00:11:07] My eyes were like, I have never seen the uncolored neon colored leaves.
[00:11:12] I had never seen like that color yellow or green or red or orange.
[00:11:17] I, it's just exquisite.
[00:11:19] And it's, it's we're so lucky to have that in this country.
[00:11:23] And anyway, that's my little go to Maine and go see the colors.
[00:11:27] Yeah, I got to mean, we actually, they, you know, they actually have a map of like the levels
[00:11:34] of bright.
[00:11:35] Oh, I know.
[00:11:36] Though as, as the state changes, they have the levels of the colors.
[00:11:41] Like, well, you should be here.
[00:11:43] This is the highest, like you can see the colors.
[00:11:45] And then it goes down, down, down.
[00:11:46] And then it's just so rad to see how our state just changes from one thing to another.
[00:11:54] Well, it is funny because it's a small, it's kind of a small window.
[00:11:57] And there, no one's ever exactly sure when it's going to hit the exact, like until you get
[00:12:02] really close to it.
[00:12:03] And then by then, like everything books up.
[00:12:04] So you have to, you have to sort of make a somewhat of a guess like in the summertime or whatever.
[00:12:09] But so I, yeah, I was, we were at all those sites and, and oh my gosh, I just,
[00:12:12] just such a beautiful part of the country.
[00:12:15] So tell us a little bit of, so you moved West Coast to, to, to Northeast.
[00:12:20] And then you had to start over.
[00:12:22] So I want to hear what it was like to start over in a new state where you're not from no
[00:12:27] sphere of influence really.
[00:12:28] Yeah.
[00:12:28] So how did you, how did you build?
[00:12:31] So I literally, I didn't put it into like perspective until I started really thinking about it.
[00:12:39] Like, you know, you start thinking about your past and how you did it.
[00:12:41] And I was like, well, I really just took like three steps in which is the manifestation process.
[00:12:48] And, and it's really just really getting clear on who I want to be around with,
[00:12:53] getting clear my vision and who I want to serve.
[00:12:56] And surrounding myself with those kinds of people and gaining so much information.
[00:13:02] And that's why joining a team was so valuable to me because I had mentors that I can like go to
[00:13:08] every time. And, you know, it's just for me, it was more about there's a goal.
[00:13:13] I want to serve people.
[00:13:14] I want to be able to dive myself into this community because this is where I'm setting my roots.
[00:13:19] So I'm my as well just embody myself as a real estate each at, at that time.
[00:13:25] And then taking step number two would be taking those action steps.
[00:13:29] So doing the classes, going out and meaning different people, you know, attaining leads,
[00:13:36] lead generation doing whatever I have to do as a real estate agent during that time.
[00:13:41] I did that. And then number three is just being open to receiving whatever is meant for me.
[00:13:46] So whether it's the commission checks, whether it's the actual clients that you
[00:13:52] attract and you become lifelong friends with them and you start developing this brand.
[00:13:58] And I didn't really be, wasn't really in tune with myself then when I was on a team because I was
[00:14:05] representing a brand for someone else. It was not my brand. But now that I'm by myself and,
[00:14:11] you know, part of a culture here at Next Home Experience is just just pretty much rock and
[00:14:19] launch me to where I am today. So those steps in my beginning days were so vital. So I knew I
[00:14:25] I had to know what I needed to do. And then kind of just, you know, elaborated and collaborated
[00:14:31] with other partners in the industry to help me become who I am today.
[00:14:37] I love that. And it's really apt. It's really apt. I was, you'll appreciate or make,
[00:14:43] you'll probably find this interesting. So last night I was, I was going to just listen to,
[00:14:48] to some, you know, sort of more of just entertainment style podcast in the evening while I was
[00:14:52] relaxing. And a friend of mine said, you really should, I think you'd find this interesting.
[00:14:57] There's a podcast by Sam Harris who's more of like, I think a fillist, sort of a philosopher,
[00:15:04] but not really. It's just kind of a deep thinker and some people like him, some people don't. I'm not
[00:15:08] here to say whether you know, you should listen to him or not. But anyway, he did a whole 45-minute
[00:15:13] piece about free will. And what was interesting was he was like, he doesn't believe in free will,
[00:15:20] which is really interesting. And then he makes this case for why we don't actually have free will.
[00:15:24] And he's able to make that case pretty logically. And so what's interesting is he says, it's not
[00:15:29] that you don't have some semblance of control over, over parts of your life. Of course you do. But
[00:15:34] for the overall sort of part of your life, really things just kind of happen to you. And then it's
[00:15:40] about what you do with what happens. You know, like it's like things are just going to happen,
[00:15:44] good things, bad things. And then it's about how what you make of those things. But he also said
[00:15:48] about getting clear with intention starts to sort of set in motion, you know, this idea of
[00:15:54] of attraction and not in like a woo-woo-ee kind of like metaphysical way. But he's like, no, it actually
[00:16:00] activates, you know, certain parts of the brain that then start to look for those things. So this
[00:16:04] idea of getting really clear about what you want, step one, is really important. And by the way,
[00:16:09] it's what every consultant does when they first go to talk to somebody. They're like, okay,
[00:16:14] tell me what you're look, what do you, what do you want here at what's the problems? What do you
[00:16:18] looking for? Let's get clear about that first. And then let's figure out how to get you, you know,
[00:16:23] those next few steps. So you're absolutely right. It's like figure out what you want, then take
[00:16:27] the steps necessary. And then the hardest part may be for a lot of people is being willing to
[00:16:31] receive, I think. Yeah. Or it seems like that would be the easiest step. But for me, I think that
[00:16:37] would be the hardest part for me. You think so? It for me. It's a truly office. So like it's,
[00:16:43] I'd be happy to open to like I'm open to receive whatever is meant for me. I like, I've accepted
[00:16:47] the hardest thing for me is the how and the when is when I think, I most of my clients
[00:16:55] have a hard time with is just, you know, like when is this going to happen? Like how am I going to
[00:17:00] get else? Like you hurry up and wait. Yeah. It's like you can't choke hold the universe in that
[00:17:07] sense where you're like, you can try. You can try, but it's not going to have the outcome is not
[00:17:13] what you want or what you think you want. So it's just, you know, again, releasing that control
[00:17:18] piece and like just just letting it flow. And that's what I did to build my business now was like,
[00:17:25] okay, I got really clear. You know, my action was to I hired, you know, two different coaches,
[00:17:31] like for me to do self, self development, get in with my inner child, do all that like
[00:17:39] shadow work, all of those things. And then applying it to my business. And you know, for personal
[00:17:46] reasons, I doing it for it. But then why can I just put it into my business? Like why can I
[00:17:52] just inflect fuse it? And then somehow I just one thing led to another, I get connected with a
[00:17:59] brand strategist who helped me develop the name holistic real estate pro. Like and she was aligned
[00:18:05] with me like mine did all of these things. It just so crazy. And how the universe just connects you.
[00:18:13] And I truly believe in divine timing hands down whatever whatever you're doing,
[00:18:20] whether it's in business or in personal, it's all about divine timing. It's it'll happen when
[00:18:23] it happens. And you'll know and you'll know just and and I think too once you get more and I'm
[00:18:31] going through this process myself is like starting to make more space for for silence and a little
[00:18:38] bit of a loan time where but not a loan time where I'm listening to other things or watching other
[00:18:44] things or just sort of taking time to sort of just allow things to emerge from within.
[00:18:49] And that idea that we have this sort of wealth of creativity and knowledge and and just feelings
[00:18:56] and sort of intuition. I know you're really big into intuition. And we'll talk I definitely want
[00:19:02] to talk about how you apply that in your business. What I've found with intuition for me is we've
[00:19:08] lived in a very noisy world right. And like our phones are constantly asking for our attention.
[00:19:12] They're begging for that attention. There's a you know there's a lot of tech companies that
[00:19:17] you know are buying for that space where they want your attention. And if I don't give myself
[00:19:21] attention if I don't actually make space for these like thoughts and ideas to emerge then they're
[00:19:28] they're just not going to be heard by my conscious mind. So so this idea about about making some time
[00:19:35] is really important because like again that's intuition. The signals are there but if you're not
[00:19:41] to do it. Yeah. Yeah. If you're not listening to your heart or your or looking at the science.
[00:19:47] There's so many signs that people just miss. And I just think for me I have to really be
[00:19:54] in tune with myself and really know that you know look beyond my third eye and just make sure that
[00:20:01] like okay what does my gut tell me that's my first instinct is what is your gut tell you if it's
[00:20:06] like a hell yes then hell yes then if it's a heck no no don't even don't even go there or if it's
[00:20:13] a man mental just sit with it a little bit it's okay to sit if you're totally yeah I totally get
[00:20:19] that yeah. So like for me too within tuition I find that what can be challenging for me is
[00:20:24] understanding what is real intuition and also what might be anxiety fear things that like for
[00:20:32] example the most obvious examples when I go to the gym which I don't ever want to do of course
[00:20:37] but but I do it because I it's a good idea so I go and then I'm I'm literally gonna be diving
[00:20:43] headfirst into like physical pain right that's like that's the reason I don't want to do it because
[00:20:46] it hurts it's terribly hard but of course it is everything in life that's worthwhile's hard so no
[00:20:51] you know that's but I don't like it but I like the way I feel when it's over but my point is is
[00:20:58] sometimes I'm just like oh I don't want to go and I'm like well okay and that's fine of course
[00:21:02] I don't want to go it's painful that makes sense but is is that really my intuition is that my
[00:21:08] wisest self or is that just a little fear part of me that's just doesn't want to you know do have
[00:21:13] you weightlifting of course and then I go oh that's actually just anxiety and then the wisest part
[00:21:19] of me says it's okay you can be anxious but go anyway and that's really my intuition right so
[00:21:24] so it's idea of of developing that in that sort of understanding of intuition versus you know
[00:21:30] oh this is like a fear that I have that you know I've had since I was a child or something like okay
[00:21:35] it's okay to have both and and so I'm curious on how you utilize oh I wanted to ask you a question
[00:21:42] about intuition so it has your what is the hit rate or the success rate that you found with your
[00:21:50] intuition in other words how often is it would you say correct a right versus oh I followed my gut
[00:21:56] there and it just didn't lead me in the right path like what's the percentage of sort of you
[00:22:01] know outcome that you want to versus outcome that you're like oh nope I got that one wrong 80%
[00:22:08] a pretty great rate there yeah 80% 20% I'm like why I should have just not done that yeah no 80%
[00:22:16] well nothing's perfect but like 80% is pretty close it's really close and I you know and I look back
[00:22:22] I was like oh and I write down everything like I write down and I try to to things the goals
[00:22:28] that I want an outcome that I want that that I desire like a clear to close it'll and I know I'm
[00:22:35] like right there but I was like oh there's something that is you know I'm preparing for the best
[00:22:41] always see and the you know what's that phrase expect the worst or yeah yeah yeah prepare for the
[00:22:47] worst expect expect the best that expect the best and so but there are things where it just
[00:22:53] the universe just like oh nope we have this thing we have this thing to deal with I'm like
[00:22:57] you know where can we not you know be like that anymore so it's just just 80% of the time
[00:23:07] I'm always right my intuition my gut is always right yeah and 20% it helps it probably you
[00:23:13] probably see yourself in some ways and I know you to a tremendous amount of action so I'm not
[00:23:18] suggesting that you just kind of let things come to you because of course life just doesn't work
[00:23:22] that way most of us yeah maybe if we're really lucky I guess but most of us don't aren't that lucky
[00:23:26] so so this I this idea of you know sort of being this almost like a leaf on on a river just kind of
[00:23:34] I'm paying attention I'm doing things but I'm also not the river I'm just gonna let the river take me
[00:23:40] yeah I'm gonna pay attention I'm gonna take action when I need to but I sort of suspect that
[00:23:44] that reduces a lot of fear and anxiety that you might have going this is all gonna work like
[00:23:50] everything's gonna work out I'm not gonna fight against what is right it's that like what is is
[00:23:56] like what is is I'm on a river and I okay and I'm gonna just let the river take me and I'm
[00:24:01] gonna pay attention and make changes when I need to but I suspect you sort of see yourself
[00:24:05] a bit that way yeah so the phrase I love and it's from a song is everything is this as
[00:24:11] should be yeah that's it everything is as should be every time my buyers or sellers are like
[00:24:17] I'm just so anxious that I you know what everything is as it should be right now it is fine
[00:24:21] we are meant that if this house was meant for you we would have gotten it if it wasn't it's not
[00:24:26] you know if it is it is it is not it's not you gotta accept that and that's okay it can you know
[00:24:31] and yes you know this we all know this mark is crazy and people are not you know manifesting
[00:24:40] their house or they're not getting their house that they want or they put so many offers and
[00:24:45] and so that fear and that discouragement you know this is where I come in and be like nope I am
[00:24:53] positive we're gonna find something like my enthusiasm my my my glow my vibe really
[00:25:00] keeps them together and I I kept them up and just making sure that you know things are supposed
[00:25:07] to be like this things are supposed to you're supposed to experience these things before you get to
[00:25:12] the you know your goal like before you attain this goal you need to experience certain things
[00:25:18] rejection fear all of these things but yet still have an open heart to receiving whatever is meant
[00:25:24] for you you know that you know it's it sounds sort of like some of the language are using sounds
[00:25:30] sort of subtle or or maybe wordplay in a sense but it isn't because I know that I get calm down a
[00:25:39] lot when like you know if something happens and somebody's wise enough in the group if I'm in a
[00:25:46] group that says don't worry it this probably just wasn't meant to be but don't worry like things
[00:25:51] are gonna work out and and if I trust that person then well usually the person ends up being right
[00:25:57] I found that to be the case maybe something what's it's that old joke it this is my favorite joke
[00:26:02] of all time and it's not a religious joke so I apologize for anyone that like take this as like a
[00:26:07] religious thing trust me it's not or at least not the way I think about it but it's just it's a really
[00:26:11] simple joke I think it's the truest thing ever it's called we make plans god laughs right which I
[00:26:16] always I love that because like what's more true than that like yeah yeah we go for something and
[00:26:21] it just that's not what the universe or whatever what an and it's okay because there's going to be
[00:26:28] something else that does this or something better yeah this or something better and that's what it
[00:26:34] is like you know today you know one of my clients we put an offer in and she was like we put it
[00:26:40] in two days ago and there's like 16 on this and it was yeah and I was like it's this or something
[00:26:47] better honestly yeah it's this or something better and if it's not then we just move on to
[00:26:52] something else it you know it it may come back around you just never know the universe is so
[00:26:57] funny that way where you know you could become a backup offer and you end up with the house
[00:27:02] you just never know I am so impressed by that that phrase this or something better and it's not
[00:27:09] just a cute thing to say to placate the you know the the client it's actually what you believe
[00:27:16] yeah because it's what you believe it doesn't come off as a cute little slogan or something
[00:27:21] that they tell you to say in sales school or whatever it's it's literally what you believe at your
[00:27:26] deepest part of you because you apply those same principles yourself and and and so
[00:27:33] if I if I have somebody who's congruent with their words and their beliefs and their actions where
[00:27:41] I know they're not just giving me a line that they you know need this will help placate the me
[00:27:45] if I'm like if I trust that person I'm like you just you just made that this disappointment slightly
[00:27:52] easier for me yeah because I trust that you know what you're doing and if you're confident about it
[00:27:59] that I'm going to be like okay good it's not so so terrible your vibration your vibration your
[00:28:03] energy that you put out there in front of your client or who your friend or whoever they they
[00:28:09] they feed off of that and a lot for me my energy is so loud and so you know I attract these
[00:28:18] they're all my clients the way I want them to like the way the type of client that I want I attract
[00:28:24] those and so they feed off of my energy and they tell me time time again you have this calming aura
[00:28:31] about yourself you have this positivity where I feel down and all of a sudden you just come up and have
[00:28:37] me look again and see and be like okay this is not the end of the road this is or just you know
[00:28:45] one one day at a time one showing at a time kind of thing it will this journey is just not always
[00:28:51] going to be perfect it's going to be perfect perfect for you and how you experience it so well
[00:28:57] almost nothing in life is linear anyway right like almost everything goes up and down up and down
[00:29:03] wild swings peaks and batteries you know heartbreak and love and and everything in between you know death
[00:29:10] birth I mean yeah truly difficult and wonderful things happen to us which are going to happen to
[00:29:16] us anyway and this idea of of not fighting the current that's already taking you is it's a it's
[00:29:24] a lifetime of practice I am not good at it I try to control every area of my life because
[00:29:29] I'm still working on it that's the human condition yeah it's a constant work within yourself
[00:29:35] especially as a for me and my line of business and my brand it's like I'm constantly working on
[00:29:41] myself every day to to make someone else's day you know feel good and and you know that's that's
[00:29:49] the goal for me it's just to serve these families in my community and to help them achieve their
[00:29:55] goal so their success is my success in that sense and so I you know I want to be here without you
[00:30:02] know the help and support and love from my clients and my friends and family I just you know I just
[00:30:07] decided to embody myself as this and just you know let go and forget the fear of what people might
[00:30:15] think and I think that's what people drew to me is because I don't care what people think of me
[00:30:19] especially in this market like in this you know I'm not I'm not your typical agent in that sense
[00:30:26] like it's like I said it's like unorthodox approach to real estate and and it's something that
[00:30:32] stands out and people are curious of what I do and and that's how I attract these clients are
[00:30:39] like oh you're like me think you sound you you do things that I like to you love crystals you love
[00:30:45] manifestation law of attraction you love all them like sure come talk to me I'll talk about it all
[00:30:51] day long with you whether it's a how about houses or not I'll talk about it yeah well and and it's
[00:30:58] you're attracting people who who are into into that and and so as a result you know you're you're
[00:31:04] not having to even convince them that you're this professional that has kind of a I don't want to
[00:31:10] say quirky because that's has a negative kind of you're not quirky in any in any way you have this
[00:31:13] more unorthodox sort of style which really at the end of the day you don't because you're a hard
[00:31:18] working REALTOR and you're working you know into the you know you're working hard but at the same
[00:31:23] time you're also like hey I I'm not gonna I'm not going to be pushing against what is I'm going to
[00:31:29] just be guiding you to what you know what we think is is what you know your next home and if things
[00:31:36] don't work out don't worry we're gonna we're boy it's very calming I would say yeah and that's
[00:31:41] where I yeah that's a lot of people have you know the reviews I get that are like you're so calming
[00:31:46] and just you're just there to you know if I call you frustrated or I'm like you know I'm like a
[00:31:53] psychologist coach like everything that they if they want to dump on me you know and that
[00:31:59] will filter out the noise and I know they're coming from a place of desperation a place of lack
[00:32:06] fear all of those things and just somehow just let them sit in it and I'll tell them sit in
[00:32:12] it's okay you know sleep on that call me tomorrow see how you I just needed just to just of course
[00:32:19] dump that on you like it's fine yeah I mean people need to people need to get things out
[00:32:25] well and then for myself for me to digest all that to to because I to I absorb a lot of energy
[00:32:34] from other people and so for me I do my modalities I'll just meditate for a little bit do a
[00:32:41] tarot reading for myself right in my journal and just remember that you know Trisha you are
[00:32:47] manifesting and attracting like my native individuals whether you know they're on the same level
[00:32:53] as you or it there it might be you know there's a little struggle there's a little anxiety there's
[00:32:57] a little fear but you are here to help them and guide them you're you're a read their reason to
[00:33:04] move forward not me and necessarily the reason but like I'm part of their you know a huge part of
[00:33:11] their journey so yeah I just kind of remember like what I do every time I remind myself who
[00:33:16] am I survey and you also you take that responsibility very seriously I can tell and that's an important
[00:33:23] thing like whatever somebody's authentic self is that they want to bring into their real estate
[00:33:29] practice they have to really be find the courage to sort of say this is who I am this is what I'm
[00:33:35] about here's why I think it serves you know you mr. Mrs. Clien or here's why I think it's important
[00:33:42] for my business but at the same time like you what you seem authenticity seems to be the the
[00:33:47] the word I would put with you is you really are that person and and as a result people are attracted
[00:33:54] because people are always attracted to authenticity whatever the authentic self is yeah whatever it is
[00:33:59] I mean you know you can have a different niche different brand or whatever you do and even all
[00:34:05] the REALTORS ask me like how did you like manage to niche down to this I was like it's really a lot
[00:34:13] of you know it is a lot of work it's a lot of self development and it was this was in the making
[00:34:18] you know years to come and I didn't do this as a drop of a hat like I didn't do this overnight this
[00:34:24] was like years in the making to actually deciding to come out like this as you know especially in
[00:34:30] industry that is so traditional yeah and for me to come out like as a holistic REALTOR and there
[00:34:36] are many people out there that practice holistic real estate you know just like me or a little bit
[00:34:42] different than me um but for me to be actually naming myself and becoming it you know mains holistic
[00:34:50] REALTOR and an industry healer like that took a lot for me to just say out there and just put it
[00:34:57] out there and you know not whole for the best but I'm just you know it's just it's a it's a risk for me
[00:35:03] you know anyway maybe people won't like that when you would do woo woo maybe it's too new and
[00:35:08] easy but you know there are so many people that deep down inside they do practice some of these things
[00:35:16] that I do I just say it out loud that's it yeah but the courage the courage to say it out loud I think
[00:35:23] is the secret sauce right like it's it's like I don't have to hide this part of me I don't have to
[00:35:28] pretend that I'm not this way and and you're you're not so different really then most of us you just
[00:35:34] talk about the things that most of us just read about yeah and and people seem to be really
[00:35:40] receptive and even colleagues are like how do I manifest this I go you're manifesting every day
[00:35:47] your thoughts create your real whether you like it or not exactly and then so so yeah
[00:35:53] well and that's why if if you if somebody accepts that that premise that we're all we're co maybe
[00:36:00] we'll call co-creating a greater right yeah it's universe and they're creating and we're sort of
[00:36:04] part of the creation process then then if if that's the case then you start to get really careful
[00:36:11] or at least aware of what you are bringing what you are thinking about where you are putting your
[00:36:17] attention because there's a lot of ways where we especially right now with the market the way it is
[00:36:22] we can we could easily be putting a tremendous amount of our energy and attention into
[00:36:28] low higher interest rates that our clients don't love lower you know less inventory for opportunities
[00:36:36] there it's there's a lot to feel crappy about if you want to I mean there's plenty of plenty of
[00:36:41] reasons and and that's okay to acknowledge that it's like you don't want to say well there's no
[00:36:45] weeds in my garden obviously you want to take the weeds out but at the same time you don't want to
[00:36:49] over focus on those weeds and miss some of the beauty that's going on at the same time.
[00:36:54] And you know a unique thing that I have my clients do I had one my current client right now
[00:37:00] because we're searching and still looking and still like doing things because we we lost out on
[00:37:08] like a couple of deals and I was like listen we have to do something different so I want you to do
[00:37:13] this assignment and this assignment is write a gratitude letter to your house that you're living in
[00:37:18] right now even if you don't own it but it's a house that you're living under the roof of it's
[00:37:24] giving you shelter give a just write out your gratitude on paper it see what comes up for you and see
[00:37:31] see how it's you know giving you shelter through cold and you know keeping warm you know you have
[00:37:38] a place to sleep like all the things that you know that you can think of give gratitude to your space
[00:37:43] and see what happens and I think that really opens up everyone's minds and just really like
[00:37:50] kind of like okay now I have respect for what I have now now the universe can like open
[00:37:55] opportunities for me to be like okay yeah here we go like here's some some listings that we can
[00:38:02] probably look at here's some you know maybe you're interested you changed you know to me there's
[00:38:06] so many different things if you don't show gratitude right now for what you have
[00:38:10] how is the universe gonna give you something better then yeah I could not agree more I think
[00:38:15] I think gratitude is is just a great way to sort of flip the mindset as quickly it's the quickest
[00:38:22] way I know to get out of distress right and and there's nothing wrong with with acknowledging
[00:38:28] distress of course like of course we need to acknowledge bad things that happen but at the same time
[00:38:32] you know this idea of going hey in a year will I have found my perfect place like at worst case
[00:38:39] scenario it's like getting fired from a job yeah yeah devastating at the time oh my god my world's
[00:38:43] over I am I don't know what I'm gonna do and then a year from now you're usually in a better job
[00:38:48] with a better position and we look back and go god why was I so stressed well because the unknown
[00:38:53] is stressful so this idea of acknowledging okay right now it's unknown you know you've lost a
[00:38:58] couple deals but let's let's sort of think forward like once you get that poem because you're
[00:39:04] gonna get a home we're going to get you something let's let's think about how you're gonna feel
[00:39:08] about that at that time and and and let's be appreciative for what you currently have I I don't
[00:39:12] think that sounds odd at all like it's it's an odd thing for maybe not odd it's an unusual thing for
[00:39:17] maybe a REALTOR to suggest but is it is it forget about you know whether you believe in
[00:39:23] manifestation or abundance or whatever yeah but regardless just practically does that change your
[00:39:28] mindset of course it does oh yeah if nothing else you just put them in a better mood for some
[00:39:35] news that they didn't want to hear yeah and I think it's just also too like for them for someone
[00:39:41] that is renting and showing appreciation for their space but then now I puts them into a mode of
[00:39:47] like home ownership or like embodying so I embody this as I mean holistic REALTOR I want them to
[00:39:56] embody themselves as a homeowner so like doing the things what a homeowner would do like what
[00:40:01] would a homeowner do you know get their money mindset straight like get get their financial
[00:40:06] straight get check out things that don't serve them anymore and clear space and just again
[00:40:14] showing that piece of gratitude and appreciation huge goes a long way like 100% of the time goes
[00:40:21] a long way when it comes to anything that you want in your life and so that's like one simple thing
[00:40:26] that one person can do it just show gratitude and but again the second thing would be just maybe
[00:40:33] try embodying yourself as a homeowner you know like you just never know once because your thought
[00:40:39] when you have that thought in there now you have to put that into action what are you going to do
[00:40:43] and you're basically telling your subconscious mind that this is real like okay I'm you know
[00:40:50] consciously yes I'm in this reality right now but subconsciously I'm going to be here so I need to
[00:40:55] bring that out into the real world and I need to figure out what I need to do to actually get
[00:41:00] there yeah yeah and so you're not mind-tricking your subconscious but you know your thoughts as
[00:41:06] soon as you think about what you want and you know how you're going to get there or you don't know
[00:41:11] how to get there but you're going to take a step anyway it's the your path will lead you to where
[00:41:18] you're supposed to be well look I mean every professional athlete or not every professional
[00:41:23] but but but but most professional sports teams have uh psychologists or or coaches that will
[00:41:29] do visualization exercises where people can you know these top athletes the people who are the very
[00:41:35] most skilled at their profession in the entire world basically are also doing these kind of exercises
[00:41:41] where they're visualizing their outcome that they want and they're not all doing it because they're
[00:41:46] all in a new age stuff they're doing it because it works yeah it works at the highest levels of
[00:41:52] athletics which is a meritocracy it's all merit-based like you don't you don't get into being a
[00:41:57] professional athlete unless you're really really good so so this idea isn't so unusual really
[00:42:02] no it's not it's not it's not it's really not very very comfortable no it's not it's just your
[00:42:09] tip you know you're just everyone's doing it and subconsciously are consciously they're doing it
[00:42:15] it's just I word it differently and it means the same thing in that sense so like you know
[00:42:21] getting really clear on your intentions are it's a huge thing like if you don't know what you're
[00:42:26] if you're not clear about who you are as a person or not clear what you want to want to desire like
[00:42:33] what what what your goal is and you know you're lost like you have to really get
[00:42:39] that understanding within yourself and then surround your people to help you understand
[00:42:43] if you don't understand get clear you know like use your resources and talk to people and that you
[00:42:50] if you want to be in this you know in a certain category if you want to get yourself to the next
[00:42:56] level you got to talk to those next level people you know like you you know if you want to have
[00:43:02] higher income talk to those people that how did they get to that higher income or you know wherever
[00:43:07] whatever industry it doesn't matter if it's real estate it doesn't matter if you're a medical
[00:43:13] whatever it's still the same process those three step process is same anyway yeah and so
[00:43:18] what's what's what's great to about talking to those people who are maybe one level above or more
[00:43:24] is that you find out what their mindset is and what their thoughts and their beliefs and how they
[00:43:29] react to disappointment and and and it's usually a much like what whenever I I love going to see like
[00:43:38] you know concerts obviously I think a lot of us do but but I'm I'm a guy's been playing guitar
[00:43:43] my whole life the reason why I like going to concerts aside from just listening to the great
[00:43:46] music is also it's it's not that I ever want to be a professional musician but it's very inspiring
[00:43:52] to see somebody who's at that next level how seriously they take their craft and as a result they
[00:43:59] have the success that I won't have because I'm not willing to put in that kind of effort but this
[00:44:04] idea of you know we're so lucky in real estate where you know we get to talk to top real tears I mean
[00:44:09] shows like mine exist that that talking people like you and and so but you know it's you're right
[00:44:14] it's it's this idea of figuring out the mindsets of the people that are a little bit further along
[00:44:19] the path than me is really could save you a lot of headache along yeah yeah and and really
[00:44:24] tuning in with that like don't just take it with a grain of salt like really like take do like
[00:44:31] you know take it away like really implement it into your life and try you know certain certain
[00:44:37] tasks or tips or something from a higher level may not work for you but at least you tried and seeing
[00:44:43] like okay maybe I can tweak that a little a little bit to you know benefit me in that sense and
[00:44:48] my brand and my business and you know like there's so many you know we had a next home conference
[00:44:53] in Houston and there are so many speakers and you know the the president of the national
[00:45:00] social REALTOR's was there and this guy is amazing I don't know we have the best right now president
[00:45:07] right now in our association ever and you know I've learned so much just five minute speech
[00:45:13] it was eye-opening for me and you know everybody comes from somewhere everybody starts from the bottom
[00:45:20] and you know and they work themselves up and and you're right if you're willing to put in that
[00:45:25] energy to get up there like that's on you for me I'm like I don't want to feel burnt out so I do
[00:45:33] whatever I feel that is best for me and my family and that's the thing like I to me I yes I am a
[00:45:39] top producer but am I like freaking number one in the company no I don't I'm not because I don't
[00:45:45] want to be I want to be able just to serve who I want to serve and you know attract the clients
[00:45:51] that are meant for me and not not feel drowned and overwhelmed and just burn out from the real estate
[00:45:58] hustle like that's not what I'm all about I'm all about comment flow and just you know moving
[00:46:05] with ease like this job shouldn't be hard at all and and it could be stressful but you know
[00:46:12] it's how you respond right it's how you respond to certain reactions and you control what you
[00:46:18] can control and I feel like I've been doing that and tweaking it and working on it every day but
[00:46:24] you know I'm successful thus far and I am so proud to like even just talk about the way I
[00:46:32] approach real estate because it's a different thing it's it it lights me up every time I talk
[00:46:38] if someone wants to talk about it I'll talk about it all day and it it's a passion of mine now
[00:46:42] is turning to something bigger than me well I'd love to talk about social media how how do you
[00:46:50] approach social media to be an extension of your authentic self so I'm curious on the content
[00:46:56] that you're that you're putting out there is just curious on your thoughts on that. So social media
[00:47:03] I'll do like the reals I'll pick a trending thing and you know I'll do I'll do a lot of I'm okay
[00:47:09] to be a friend of camera so it doesn't really matter to me I'll invite a lender that who is aligned
[00:47:14] with me to join on them the fun but I'll do you know I'll share the steps that I take you know to
[00:47:21] becoming successful so three steps to becoming or manifesting your house so I'll put it in slides
[00:47:27] I'll give them the verbiage that I use on a daily basis and I don't put out the market analysis
[00:47:35] I don't put out that stuff I do that I have that for myself so I can have the knowledge and expertise
[00:47:41] on my market but the numbers and the grid and all this stuff that's not for me like mine is more of
[00:47:47] just like being funny being real being raw it's not always sunshine the rainbows you know for being
[00:47:56] in real estate and or even on the holistic side it's not always you know who woe you know it's I you
[00:48:01] know I have normal human being too it's just you know I just use a lot of my energy and my time to
[00:48:08] creating content with people that will grasp that you know like you know I have you know I have
[00:48:14] like I said I've partnered up with a lender and she and I do TikToks and Reels together that
[00:48:19] that make it funny and seems like we're like a married couple or like you know just like a dynamic duo
[00:48:25] just just doing fun things and I'll throw in the verbiage of manifestation and I'll do the hashtags
[00:48:31] all those things to get it out there so that way people know about it and I don't know it if
[00:48:38] social media is a great platform for me to express more of my to my audience and joining like
[00:48:47] podcasts and things like that guest speaking is it's a huge thing for me too like you know I've
[00:48:51] been doing it for the past you know two years now like just guest podcasting and just reaching out
[00:48:56] to a different audience and people find me somehow they're like I want to move to Maine and I want you
[00:49:02] I'm like oh where do you find me on a podcast or on Instagram and like it was you know they're not
[00:49:08] it's very far few you know what I mean but that far few turns out to be really cool like I was like
[00:49:13] oh someone actually was listening to me or seeing what you know holistic real estate is about like
[00:49:20] this is where if they if I can make an impact on them somehow to move forward into manifesting a
[00:49:28] house that I'm like you know my job's done in that sense like yes okay let's do this so well we
[00:49:35] should also mention before we wrap up that you know people do move to Maine from other parts of
[00:49:41] the country you did certainly a lot of your clients have or sometimes they have vacation homes
[00:49:48] in the northeast and so you know for anyone out there who's listening who may have people that are
[00:49:53] exploring the northeast for you know vacation home or maybe move um Trish would love to
[00:49:59] opportunity to work with you might as well let's put that out in the universe too so any
[00:50:03] agent out there would let and Trish by the way has clients that retire and they don't always retire
[00:50:09] in Maine they might go somewhere else like Florida or Texas or ever Arizona or rubber people going
[00:50:15] mostly Maynors the snowboards go to Florida yeah they go down south so yeah like there's so does
[00:50:22] everyone here in Illinois they all go to Florida but but my point is is that you know look this this
[00:50:29] is a referral based business also with with agents and you know let's put that out there that if
[00:50:35] if you're looking for you know a good referral partner in in Maine Trish is is is awesome and she's
[00:50:43] super well respected or clients lover obviously she's a top producer and she's fun so I mean if
[00:50:49] nothing else she's fun and fun goes a long way in my book in real estate because very few people
[00:50:56] are willing to be fun so I I love that so if if Trish if there is another agent out there listening
[00:51:02] who either wants to work for business to you or maybe wants to you know see if you have business
[00:51:07] for them what's the best way that or by the way we also it's not only a REALTOR who listen to us
[00:51:13] I suspect it's 99% of your your your life is somebody who's not an agent who's maybe
[00:51:22] thinking about going to Maine and maybe they want to work with you what's the best way that anyone
[00:51:27] who wants to connect with you should get into I'm usually on my Instagram at holistic real estate

[00:51:59] blow your mind and even if you just just google the images and then when when you see the images
[00:52:05] on google realize that does it doesn't even do it a lick of justice like no it's so much more
[00:52:10] intense than that yeah it'll it'll blow your mind and it's really the only part of the country
[00:52:16] that really has that there's a train actually there's a tour train from Boston all the way up like I
[00:52:24] think there is like a they call it peepers the peeper tour and so it goes all the way up to Maine
[00:52:30] and then come back down down to Boston so there's so many there's so many tours and attractions
[00:52:35] or you know companies out there that will take you on a tour through mass Vermont New Hampshire and

Link to that as well in the show notes. Trish, welcome to the show. Thank you for having me, D.J. Paris. This is amazing. We were both just laughing because Trish's last name is Italian. She goes, I'm not really Italian. I said, well, my last name is Paris and I'm not French. Go figure. But I'm glad we're talking to people with unusual last names that don't match their ethnicities. But I would love to learn a little bit more about you and tell our exposure audience to your way of doing business. I'm really excited to chat with you. I love the fact that I think in real estate, a lot of times people don't have enough fun in the sense of the things that may be thought to be not as aligned with real estate. So in real estate, we like to think, oh, the headshot needs to look perfect. I need to be more conservative and buttoned up and just a more traditional business stuffy kind of approach. And you are like, no, my authentic self is I am into some interesting cool things that are important to me. And I'm going to embed that into my business and I just love that. So nobody probably knows what yet what we're talking about. So I'm excited to get to that. But before we get to what you're doing today, I want to hear about how you got started. So tell us how you got into real estate. So I back in 2003 and 4, I was working as a receptionist for a salon and there was a hair stylist that does mortgages on the side. And I was like, how do you manage yourself doing mortgages and doing hair at the same time? I just don't even know how to do that. But that started, that scene was planted in my hand. I was like, oh, maybe I should try it in California. This was when I was in California. And fast-forwarded to 2014, I just jumped right in. There was an opportunity to be a marketing manager for a team, for real estate agency that I first started out in. And I grew with them and then somehow, it is so weird because the universe just kind of aligns you and connects with you, puts you in the right place at the right time. So the team that I was working for or working with, their family lives around the block from my parents' house in Los Angeles. It is so cool. I've never met them, yeah, never met them in my life before until I moved to Maine. And then they had California ties, Los Angeles ties, and so happens that they lived around the block from my parents' house. It's so weird. So weird. And now we've become with friends. And I've learned so much from starting out as a team member and then developing my own brand successfully on my own since I've left the team. So how did you go from West Coast to East Coast? You made a huge shift there. That was a quantum leap from me. So when we literally decided to move from California to make me and my husband and I, we don't want to raise our kids out here. We don't, you know, in LA, I want to say something different. So we decided to move closer to his family. And I've I've been up to everything to pick up and then move really. And then I started to real estate maybe six months to eight months later. And I just went on a leg and I barely had any there, like nothing. Sure. Well, I always know that there's something about, yeah, there's something about the idea of sort of having to make it work. Like for people that are, there's like a gift, like the gift of desperation in a sense and I'm not saying you were desperate. Yeah, not having a safety net is definitely like a huge risk. And but but I always find it in some ways like it sort of forces people to get really, really, you know, sort of in line with their goals. And and then they can, you know, when there's no other option, it's a lot of times you just figure out a way to make it work. Yeah, it was very. You know, scary, you know, when I know I feel like it's the right thing to do and there's something better on the other side once I get through this past this fear. And so, you know, moving from Los Angeles to Maine, just was the best as the entire family. My mom and dad bought a house out here, followed me and their grandkids out here to, yeah. So they have two properties, one in LA and then one here in Maine that I manage. Me and my husband take care of while they're gone and they go back and forth. So I mean, it's a whole win-win situation for all, you know, any mean it's all for the highest good. So it's for my family and my parents. Yeah, and I mean, that's amazing. And the culture is very different, right? So you were like Southern California and then you moved to sort of, you know, mid to northern parts of Maine. And people are different. Values are different. Everything's different. Everything is different. But the one thing I can say about Maine is out here when I first, they're so welcoming, so friendly. I stuck out, obviously, for, you know, coming from a... You're the West Coast granola girl. Yeah. Yeah. So I was like, you know, coming from pine, like, you know, palm trees, the beach, to sandy, you know, tan all the time to like, to like pine trees and snow. Yeah. And then, you know, I'm not experiencing, I mean, there's a lot is that I since living here in Maine and I would never change. And it was like I said, it was just the best decision, best quantum leap decision that I've ever made in my whole entire life so far. So that was like, I love that. And now you, yeah, you get to see the, you get to see the colors change, you get to see the seasons, you get to eat a lot of lobster. There's, there's, there are some benefits to living in Maine. You're by the mountains, you're by the water. Oh, just everything. I just, it's such a, it's, everything. By the way, for anyone that has not seen the colors change in the northeast, starting around like September, October, if you've never done that, like I had, I had a friend who, I mean, there's one of those things that people told me for years, you got to see the colors change. And I was like, yeah, yeah, yeah, you know, whatever. Yeah. And then finally, I had a friend in Boston and she goes, you've never seen the colors change? And I'd been, I've been to almost all the states, not all of them, but there's like five or six I hadn't been to at that time. And those happen to be like New Hampshire, Vermont and Maine, where I still haven't been to Vermont. But New Hampshire and Maine, I had never been to. And she's like, oh, perfect. Flying to Boston and drive up. And I legitimately was just the whole entire weekend or however long I was there. I was, I was just constantly ping pong. My eyes were like, I have never seen the uncolored neon colored leaves. I had never seen like that color yellow or green or red or orange. I, it's just exquisite. And it's, it's we're so lucky to have that in this country. And anyway, that's my little go to Maine and go see the colors. Yeah, I got to mean, we actually, they, you know, they actually have a map of like the levels of bright. Oh, I know. Though as, as the state changes, they have the levels of the colors. Like, well, you should be here. This is the highest, like you can see the colors. And then it goes down, down, down. And then it's just so rad to see how our state just changes from one thing to another. Well, it is funny because it's a small, it's kind of a small window. And there, no one's ever exactly sure when it's going to hit the exact, like until you get really close to it. And then by then, like everything books up. So you have to, you have to sort of make a somewhat of a guess like in the summertime or whatever. But so I, yeah, I was, we were at all those sites and, and oh my gosh, I just, just such a beautiful part of the country. So tell us a little bit of, so you moved West Coast to, to, to Northeast. And then you had to start over. So I want to hear what it was like to start over in a new state where you're not from no sphere of influence really. Yeah. So how did you, how did you build? So I literally, I didn't put it into like perspective until I started really thinking about it. Like, you know, you start thinking about your past and how you did it. And I was like, well, I really just took like three steps in which is the manifestation process. And, and it's really just really getting clear on who I want to be around with, getting clear my vision and who I want to serve. And surrounding myself with those kinds of people and gaining so much information. And that's why joining a team was so valuable to me because I had mentors that I can like go to every time. And, you know, it's just for me, it was more about there's a goal. I want to serve people. I want to be able to dive myself into this community because this is where I'm setting my roots. So I'm my as well just embody myself as a real estate each at, at that time. And then taking step number two would be taking those action steps. So doing the classes, going out and meaning different people, you know, attaining leads, lead generation doing whatever I have to do as a real estate agent during that time. I did that. And then number three is just being open to receiving whatever is meant for me. So whether it's the commission checks, whether it's the actual clients that you attract and you become lifelong friends with them and you start developing this brand. And I didn't really be, wasn't really in tune with myself then when I was on a team because I was representing a brand for someone else. It was not my brand. But now that I'm by myself and, you know, part of a culture here at Next Home Experience is just just pretty much rock and launch me to where I am today. So those steps in my beginning days were so vital. So I knew I I had to know what I needed to do. And then kind of just, you know, elaborated and collaborated with other partners in the industry to help me become who I am today. I love that. And it's really apt. It's really apt. I was, you'll appreciate or make, you'll probably find this interesting. So last night I was, I was going to just listen to, to some, you know, sort of more of just entertainment style podcast in the evening while I was relaxing. And a friend of mine said, you really should, I think you'd find this interesting. There's a podcast by Sam Harris who's more of like, I think a fillist, sort of a philosopher, but not really. It's just kind of a deep thinker and some people like him, some people don't. I'm not here to say whether you know, you should listen to him or not. But anyway, he did a whole 45-minute piece about free will. And what was interesting was he was like, he doesn't believe in free will, which is really interesting. And then he makes this case for why we don't actually have free will. And he's able to make that case pretty logically. And so what's interesting is he says, it's not that you don't have some semblance of control over, over parts of your life. Of course you do. But for the overall sort of part of your life, really things just kind of happen to you. And then it's about what you do with what happens. You know, like it's like things are just going to happen, good things, bad things. And then it's about how what you make of those things. But he also said about getting clear with intention starts to sort of set in motion, you know, this idea of of attraction and not in like a woo-woo-ee kind of like metaphysical way. But he's like, no, it actually activates, you know, certain parts of the brain that then start to look for those things. So this idea of getting really clear about what you want, step one, is really important. And by the way, it's what every consultant does when they first go to talk to somebody. They're like, okay, tell me what you're look, what do you, what do you want here at what's the problems? What do you looking for? Let's get clear about that first. And then let's figure out how to get you, you know, those next few steps. So you're absolutely right. It's like figure out what you want, then take the steps necessary. And then the hardest part may be for a lot of people is being willing to receive, I think. Yeah. Or it seems like that would be the easiest step. But for me, I think that would be the hardest part for me. You think so? It for me. It's a truly office. So like it's, I'd be happy to open to like I'm open to receive whatever is meant for me. I like, I've accepted the hardest thing for me is the how and the when is when I think, I most of my clients have a hard time with is just, you know, like when is this going to happen? Like how am I going to get else? Like you hurry up and wait. Yeah. It's like you can't choke hold the universe in that sense where you're like, you can try. You can try, but it's not going to have the outcome is not what you want or what you think you want. So it's just, you know, again, releasing that control piece and like just just letting it flow. And that's what I did to build my business now was like, okay, I got really clear. You know, my action was to I hired, you know, two different coaches, like for me to do self, self development, get in with my inner child, do all that like shadow work, all of those things. And then applying it to my business. And you know, for personal reasons, I doing it for it. But then why can I just put it into my business? Like why can I just inflect fuse it? And then somehow I just one thing led to another, I get connected with a brand strategist who helped me develop the name holistic real estate pro. Like and she was aligned with me like mine did all of these things. It just so crazy. And how the universe just connects you. And I truly believe in divine timing hands down whatever whatever you're doing, whether it's in business or in personal, it's all about divine timing. It's it'll happen when it happens. And you'll know and you'll know just and and I think too once you get more and I'm going through this process myself is like starting to make more space for for silence and a little bit of a loan time where but not a loan time where I'm listening to other things or watching other things or just sort of taking time to sort of just allow things to emerge from within. And that idea that we have this sort of wealth of creativity and knowledge and and just feelings and sort of intuition. I know you're really big into intuition. And we'll talk I definitely want to talk about how you apply that in your business. What I've found with intuition for me is we've lived in a very noisy world right. And like our phones are constantly asking for our attention. They're begging for that attention. There's a you know there's a lot of tech companies that you know are buying for that space where they want your attention. And if I don't give myself attention if I don't actually make space for these like thoughts and ideas to emerge then they're they're just not going to be heard by my conscious mind. So so this idea about about making some time is really important because like again that's intuition. The signals are there but if you're not to do it. Yeah. Yeah. If you're not listening to your heart or your or looking at the science. There's so many signs that people just miss. And I just think for me I have to really be in tune with myself and really know that you know look beyond my third eye and just make sure that like okay what does my gut tell me that's my first instinct is what is your gut tell you if it's like a hell yes then hell yes then if it's a heck no no don't even don't even go there or if it's a man mental just sit with it a little bit it's okay to sit if you're totally yeah I totally get that yeah. So like for me too within tuition I find that what can be challenging for me is understanding what is real intuition and also what might be anxiety fear things that like for example the most obvious examples when I go to the gym which I don't ever want to do of course but but I do it because I it's a good idea so I go and then I'm I'm literally gonna be diving headfirst into like physical pain right that's like that's the reason I don't want to do it because it hurts it's terribly hard but of course it is everything in life that's worthwhile's hard so no you know that's but I don't like it but I like the way I feel when it's over but my point is is sometimes I'm just like oh I don't want to go and I'm like well okay and that's fine of course I don't want to go it's painful that makes sense but is is that really my intuition is that my wisest self or is that just a little fear part of me that's just doesn't want to you know do have you weightlifting of course and then I go oh that's actually just anxiety and then the wisest part of me says it's okay you can be anxious but go anyway and that's really my intuition right so so it's idea of of developing that in that sort of understanding of intuition versus you know oh this is like a fear that I have that you know I've had since I was a child or something like okay it's okay to have both and and so I'm curious on how you utilize oh I wanted to ask you a question about intuition so it has your what is the hit rate or the success rate that you found with your intuition in other words how often is it would you say correct a right versus oh I followed my gut there and it just didn't lead me in the right path like what's the percentage of sort of you know outcome that you want to versus outcome that you're like oh nope I got that one wrong 80% a pretty great rate there yeah 80% 20% I'm like why I should have just not done that yeah no 80% well nothing's perfect but like 80% is pretty close it's really close and I you know and I look back I was like oh and I write down everything like I write down and I try to to things the goals that I want an outcome that I want that that I desire like a clear to close it'll and I know I'm like right there but I was like oh there's something that is you know I'm preparing for the best always see and the you know what's that phrase expect the worst or yeah yeah yeah prepare for the worst expect expect the best that expect the best and so but there are things where it just the universe just like oh nope we have this thing we have this thing to deal with I'm like you know where can we not you know be like that anymore so it's just just 80% of the time I'm always right my intuition my gut is always right yeah and 20% it helps it probably you probably see yourself in some ways and I know you to a tremendous amount of action so I'm not suggesting that you just kind of let things come to you because of course life just doesn't work that way most of us yeah maybe if we're really lucky I guess but most of us don't aren't that lucky so so this I this idea of you know sort of being this almost like a leaf on on a river just kind of I'm paying attention I'm doing things but I'm also not the river I'm just gonna let the river take me yeah I'm gonna pay attention I'm gonna take action when I need to but I sort of suspect that that reduces a lot of fear and anxiety that you might have going this is all gonna work like everything's gonna work out I'm not gonna fight against what is right it's that like what is is like what is is I'm on a river and I okay and I'm gonna just let the river take me and I'm gonna pay attention and make changes when I need to but I suspect you sort of see yourself a bit that way yeah so the phrase I love and it's from a song is everything is this as should be yeah that's it everything is as should be every time my buyers or sellers are like I'm just so anxious that I you know what everything is as it should be right now it is fine we are meant that if this house was meant for you we would have gotten it if it wasn't it's not you know if it is it is it is not it's not you gotta accept that and that's okay it can you know and yes you know this we all know this mark is crazy and people are not you know manifesting their house or they're not getting their house that they want or they put so many offers and and so that fear and that discouragement you know this is where I come in and be like nope I am positive we're gonna find something like my enthusiasm my my my glow my vibe really keeps them together and I I kept them up and just making sure that you know things are supposed to be like this things are supposed to you're supposed to experience these things before you get to the you know your goal like before you attain this goal you need to experience certain things rejection fear all of these things but yet still have an open heart to receiving whatever is meant for you you know that you know it's it sounds sort of like some of the language are using sounds sort of subtle or or maybe wordplay in a sense but it isn't because I know that I get calm down a lot when like you know if something happens and somebody's wise enough in the group if I'm in a group that says don't worry it this probably just wasn't meant to be but don't worry like things are gonna work out and and if I trust that person then well usually the person ends up being right I found that to be the case maybe something what's it's that old joke it this is my favorite joke of all time and it's not a religious joke so I apologize for anyone that like take this as like a religious thing trust me it's not or at least not the way I think about it but it's just it's a really simple joke I think it's the truest thing ever it's called we make plans god laughs right which I always I love that because like what's more true than that like yeah yeah we go for something and it just that's not what the universe or whatever what an and it's okay because there's going to be something else that does this or something better yeah this or something better and that's what it is like you know today you know one of my clients we put an offer in and she was like we put it in two days ago and there's like 16 on this and it was yeah and I was like it's this or something better honestly yeah it's this or something better and if it's not then we just move on to something else it you know it it may come back around you just never know the universe is so funny that way where you know you could become a backup offer and you end up with the house you just never know I am so impressed by that that phrase this or something better and it's not just a cute thing to say to placate the you know the the client it's actually what you believe yeah because it's what you believe it doesn't come off as a cute little slogan or something that they tell you to say in sales school or whatever it's it's literally what you believe at your deepest part of you because you apply those same principles yourself and and and so if I if I have somebody who's congruent with their words and their beliefs and their actions where I know they're not just giving me a line that they you know need this will help placate the me if I'm like if I trust that person I'm like you just you just made that this disappointment slightly easier for me yeah because I trust that you know what you're doing and if you're confident about it that I'm going to be like okay good it's not so so terrible your vibration your vibration your energy that you put out there in front of your client or who your friend or whoever they they they feed off of that and a lot for me my energy is so loud and so you know I attract these they're all my clients the way I want them to like the way the type of client that I want I attract those and so they feed off of my energy and they tell me time time again you have this calming aura about yourself you have this positivity where I feel down and all of a sudden you just come up and have me look again and see and be like okay this is not the end of the road this is or just you know one one day at a time one showing at a time kind of thing it will this journey is just not always going to be perfect it's going to be perfect perfect for you and how you experience it so well almost nothing in life is linear anyway right like almost everything goes up and down up and down wild swings peaks and batteries you know heartbreak and love and and everything in between you know death birth I mean yeah truly difficult and wonderful things happen to us which are going to happen to us anyway and this idea of of not fighting the current that's already taking you is it's a it's a lifetime of practice I am not good at it I try to control every area of my life because I'm still working on it that's the human condition yeah it's a constant work within yourself especially as a for me and my line of business and my brand it's like I'm constantly working on myself every day to to make someone else's day you know feel good and and you know that's that's the goal for me it's just to serve these families in my community and to help them achieve their goal so their success is my success in that sense and so I you know I want to be here without you know the help and support and love from my clients and my friends and family I just you know I just decided to embody myself as this and just you know let go and forget the fear of what people might think and I think that's what people drew to me is because I don't care what people think of me especially in this market like in this you know I'm not I'm not your typical agent in that sense like it's like I said it's like unorthodox approach to real estate and and it's something that stands out and people are curious of what I do and and that's how I attract these clients are like oh you're like me think you sound you you do things that I like to you love crystals you love manifestation law of attraction you love all them like sure come talk to me I'll talk about it all day long with you whether it's a how about houses or not I'll talk about it yeah well and and it's you're attracting people who who are into into that and and so as a result you know you're you're not having to even convince them that you're this professional that has kind of a I don't want to say quirky because that's has a negative kind of you're not quirky in any in any way you have this more unorthodox sort of style which really at the end of the day you don't because you're a hard working REALTOR and you're working you know into the you know you're working hard but at the same time you're also like hey I I'm not gonna I'm not going to be pushing against what is I'm going to just be guiding you to what you know what we think is is what you know your next home and if things don't work out don't worry we're gonna we're boy it's very calming I would say yeah and that's where I yeah that's a lot of people have you know the reviews I get that are like you're so calming and just you're just there to you know if I call you frustrated or I'm like you know I'm like a psychologist coach like everything that they if they want to dump on me you know and that will filter out the noise and I know they're coming from a place of desperation a place of lack fear all of those things and just somehow just let them sit in it and I'll tell them sit in it's okay you know sleep on that call me tomorrow see how you I just needed just to just of course dump that on you like it's fine yeah I mean people need to people need to get things out well and then for myself for me to digest all that to to because I to I absorb a lot of energy from other people and so for me I do my modalities I'll just meditate for a little bit do a tarot reading for myself right in my journal and just remember that you know Trisha you are manifesting and attracting like my native individuals whether you know they're on the same level as you or it there it might be you know there's a little struggle there's a little anxiety there's a little fear but you are here to help them and guide them you're you're a read their reason to move forward not me and necessarily the reason but like I'm part of their you know a huge part of their journey so yeah I just kind of remember like what I do every time I remind myself who am I survey and you also you take that responsibility very seriously I can tell and that's an important thing like whatever somebody's authentic self is that they want to bring into their real estate practice they have to really be find the courage to sort of say this is who I am this is what I'm about here's why I think it serves you know you mr. Mrs. Clien or here's why I think it's important for my business but at the same time like you what you seem authenticity seems to be the the the word I would put with you is you really are that person and and as a result people are attracted because people are always attracted to authenticity whatever the authentic self is yeah whatever it is I mean you know you can have a different niche different brand or whatever you do and even all the REALTORS ask me like how did you like manage to niche down to this I was like it's really a lot of you know it is a lot of work it's a lot of self development and it was this was in the making you know years to come and I didn't do this as a drop of a hat like I didn't do this overnight this was like years in the making to actually deciding to come out like this as you know especially in industry that is so traditional yeah and for me to come out like as a holistic REALTOR and there are many people out there that practice holistic real estate you know just like me or a little bit different than me um but for me to be actually naming myself and becoming it you know mains holistic REALTOR and an industry healer like that took a lot for me to just say out there and just put it out there and you know not whole for the best but I'm just you know it's just it's a it's a risk for me you know anyway maybe people won't like that when you would do woo woo maybe it's too new and easy but you know there are so many people that deep down inside they do practice some of these things that I do I just say it out loud that's it yeah but the courage the courage to say it out loud I think is the secret sauce right like it's it's like I don't have to hide this part of me I don't have to pretend that I'm not this way and and you're you're not so different really then most of us you just talk about the things that most of us just read about yeah and and people seem to be really receptive and even colleagues are like how do I manifest this I go you're manifesting every day your thoughts create your real whether you like it or not exactly and then so so yeah well and that's why if if you if somebody accepts that that premise that we're all we're co maybe we'll call co-creating a greater right yeah it's universe and they're creating and we're sort of part of the creation process then then if if that's the case then you start to get really careful or at least aware of what you are bringing what you are thinking about where you are putting your attention because there's a lot of ways where we especially right now with the market the way it is we can we could easily be putting a tremendous amount of our energy and attention into low higher interest rates that our clients don't love lower you know less inventory for opportunities there it's there's a lot to feel crappy about if you want to I mean there's plenty of plenty of reasons and and that's okay to acknowledge that it's like you don't want to say well there's no weeds in my garden obviously you want to take the weeds out but at the same time you don't want to over focus on those weeds and miss some of the beauty that's going on at the same time. And you know a unique thing that I have my clients do I had one my current client right now because we're searching and still looking and still like doing things because we we lost out on like a couple of deals and I was like listen we have to do something different so I want you to do this assignment and this assignment is write a gratitude letter to your house that you're living in right now even if you don't own it but it's a house that you're living under the roof of it's giving you shelter give a just write out your gratitude on paper it see what comes up for you and see see how it's you know giving you shelter through cold and you know keeping warm you know you have a place to sleep like all the things that you know that you can think of give gratitude to your space and see what happens and I think that really opens up everyone's minds and just really like kind of like okay now I have respect for what I have now now the universe can like open opportunities for me to be like okay yeah here we go like here's some some listings that we can probably look at here's some you know maybe you're interested you changed you know to me there's so many different things if you don't show gratitude right now for what you have how is the universe gonna give you something better then yeah I could not agree more I think I think gratitude is is just a great way to sort of flip the mindset as quickly it's the quickest way I know to get out of distress right and and there's nothing wrong with with acknowledging distress of course like of course we need to acknowledge bad things that happen but at the same time you know this idea of going hey in a year will I have found my perfect place like at worst case scenario it's like getting fired from a job yeah yeah devastating at the time oh my god my world's over I am I don't know what I'm gonna do and then a year from now you're usually in a better job with a better position and we look back and go god why was I so stressed well because the unknown is stressful so this idea of acknowledging okay right now it's unknown you know you've lost a couple deals but let's let's sort of think forward like once you get that poem because you're gonna get a home we're going to get you something let's let's think about how you're gonna feel about that at that time and and and let's be appreciative for what you currently have I I don't think that sounds odd at all like it's it's an odd thing for maybe not odd it's an unusual thing for maybe a REALTOR to suggest but is it is it forget about you know whether you believe in manifestation or abundance or whatever yeah but regardless just practically does that change your mindset of course it does oh yeah if nothing else you just put them in a better mood for some news that they didn't want to hear yeah and I think it's just also too like for them for someone that is renting and showing appreciation for their space but then now I puts them into a mode of like home ownership or like embodying so I embody this as I mean holistic REALTOR I want them to embody themselves as a homeowner so like doing the things what a homeowner would do like what would a homeowner do you know get their money mindset straight like get get their financial straight get check out things that don't serve them anymore and clear space and just again showing that piece of gratitude and appreciation huge goes a long way like 100% of the time goes a long way when it comes to anything that you want in your life and so that's like one simple thing that one person can do it just show gratitude and but again the second thing would be just maybe try embodying yourself as a homeowner you know like you just never know once because your thought when you have that thought in there now you have to put that into action what are you going to do and you're basically telling your subconscious mind that this is real like okay I'm you know consciously yes I'm in this reality right now but subconsciously I'm going to be here so I need to bring that out into the real world and I need to figure out what I need to do to actually get there yeah yeah and so you're not mind-tricking your subconscious but you know your thoughts as soon as you think about what you want and you know how you're going to get there or you don't know how to get there but you're going to take a step anyway it's the your path will lead you to where you're supposed to be well look I mean every professional athlete or not every professional but but but but most professional sports teams have uh psychologists or or coaches that will do visualization exercises where people can you know these top athletes the people who are the very most skilled at their profession in the entire world basically are also doing these kind of exercises where they're visualizing their outcome that they want and they're not all doing it because they're all in a new age stuff they're doing it because it works yeah it works at the highest levels of athletics which is a meritocracy it's all merit-based like you don't you don't get into being a professional athlete unless you're really really good so so this idea isn't so unusual really no it's not it's not it's not it's really not very very comfortable no it's not it's just your tip you know you're just everyone's doing it and subconsciously are consciously they're doing it it's just I word it differently and it means the same thing in that sense so like you know getting really clear on your intentions are it's a huge thing like if you don't know what you're if you're not clear about who you are as a person or not clear what you want to want to desire like what what what your goal is and you know you're lost like you have to really get that understanding within yourself and then surround your people to help you understand if you don't understand get clear you know like use your resources and talk to people and that you if you want to be in this you know in a certain category if you want to get yourself to the next level you got to talk to those next level people you know like you you know if you want to have higher income talk to those people that how did they get to that higher income or you know wherever whatever industry it doesn't matter if it's real estate it doesn't matter if you're a medical whatever it's still the same process those three step process is same anyway yeah and so what's what's what's great to about talking to those people who are maybe one level above or more is that you find out what their mindset is and what their thoughts and their beliefs and how they react to disappointment and and and it's usually a much like what whenever I I love going to see like you know concerts obviously I think a lot of us do but but I'm I'm a guy's been playing guitar my whole life the reason why I like going to concerts aside from just listening to the great music is also it's it's not that I ever want to be a professional musician but it's very inspiring to see somebody who's at that next level how seriously they take their craft and as a result they have the success that I won't have because I'm not willing to put in that kind of effort but this idea of you know we're so lucky in real estate where you know we get to talk to top real tears I mean shows like mine exist that that talking people like you and and so but you know it's you're right it's it's this idea of figuring out the mindsets of the people that are a little bit further along the path than me is really could save you a lot of headache along yeah yeah and and really tuning in with that like don't just take it with a grain of salt like really like take do like you know take it away like really implement it into your life and try you know certain certain tasks or tips or something from a higher level may not work for you but at least you tried and seeing like okay maybe I can tweak that a little a little bit to you know benefit me in that sense and my brand and my business and you know like there's so many you know we had a next home conference in Houston and there are so many speakers and you know the the president of the national social REALTOR's was there and this guy is amazing I don't know we have the best right now president right now in our association ever and you know I've learned so much just five minute speech it was eye-opening for me and you know everybody comes from somewhere everybody starts from the bottom and you know and they work themselves up and and you're right if you're willing to put in that energy to get up there like that's on you for me I'm like I don't want to feel burnt out so I do whatever I feel that is best for me and my family and that's the thing like I to me I yes I am a top producer but am I like freaking number one in the company no I don't I'm not because I don't want to be I want to be able just to serve who I want to serve and you know attract the clients that are meant for me and not not feel drowned and overwhelmed and just burn out from the real estate hustle like that's not what I'm all about I'm all about comment flow and just you know moving with ease like this job shouldn't be hard at all and and it could be stressful but you know it's how you respond right it's how you respond to certain reactions and you control what you can control and I feel like I've been doing that and tweaking it and working on it every day but you know I'm successful thus far and I am so proud to like even just talk about the way I approach real estate because it's a different thing it's it it lights me up every time I talk if someone wants to talk about it I'll talk about it all day and it it's a passion of mine now is turning to something bigger than me well I'd love to talk about social media how how do you approach social media to be an extension of your authentic self so I'm curious on the content that you're that you're putting out there is just curious on your thoughts on that. So social media I'll do like the reals I'll pick a trending thing and you know I'll do I'll do a lot of I'm okay to be a friend of camera so it doesn't really matter to me I'll invite a lender that who is aligned with me to join on them the fun but I'll do you know I'll share the steps that I take you know to becoming successful so three steps to becoming or manifesting your house so I'll put it in slides I'll give them the verbiage that I use on a daily basis and I don't put out the market analysis I don't put out that stuff I do that I have that for myself so I can have the knowledge and expertise on my market but the numbers and the grid and all this stuff that's not for me like mine is more of just like being funny being real being raw it's not always sunshine the rainbows you know for being in real estate and or even on the holistic side it's not always you know who woe you know it's I you know I have normal human being too it's just you know I just use a lot of my energy and my time to creating content with people that will grasp that you know like you know I have you know I have like I said I've partnered up with a lender and she and I do TikToks and Reels together that that make it funny and seems like we're like a married couple or like you know just like a dynamic duo just just doing fun things and I'll throw in the verbiage of manifestation and I'll do the hashtags all those things to get it out there so that way people know about it and I don't know it if social media is a great platform for me to express more of my to my audience and joining like podcasts and things like that guest speaking is it's a huge thing for me too like you know I've been doing it for the past you know two years now like just guest podcasting and just reaching out to a different audience and people find me somehow they're like I want to move to Maine and I want you I'm like oh where do you find me on a podcast or on Instagram and like it was you know they're not it's very far few you know what I mean but that far few turns out to be really cool like I was like oh someone actually was listening to me or seeing what you know holistic real estate is about like this is where if they if I can make an impact on them somehow to move forward into manifesting a house that I'm like you know my job's done in that sense like yes okay let's do this so well we should also mention before we wrap up that you know people do move to Maine from other parts of the country you did certainly a lot of your clients have or sometimes they have vacation homes in the northeast and so you know for anyone out there who's listening who may have people that are exploring the northeast for you know vacation home or maybe move um Trish would love to opportunity to work with you might as well let's put that out in the universe too so any agent out there would let and Trish by the way has clients that retire and they don't always retire in Maine they might go somewhere else like Florida or Texas or ever Arizona or rubber people going mostly Maynors the snowboards go to Florida yeah they go down south so yeah like there's so does everyone here in Illinois they all go to Florida but but my point is is that you know look this this is a referral based business also with with agents and you know let's put that out there that if if you're looking for you know a good referral partner in in Maine Trish is is is awesome and she's super well respected or clients lover obviously she's a top producer and she's fun so I mean if nothing else she's fun and fun goes a long way in my book in real estate because very few people are willing to be fun so I I love that so if if Trish if there is another agent out there listening who either wants to work for business to you or maybe wants to you know see if you have business for them what's the best way that or by the way we also it's not only a REALTOR who listen to us I suspect it's 99% of your your your life is somebody who's not an agent who's maybe thinking about going to Maine and maybe they want to work with you what's the best way that anyone who wants to connect with you should get into I'm usually on my Instagram at holistic real estate pro but my website it'll be in the show notes down there you can connect me with me there my number my bio everything is on there all about me we'll put it all in there too yeah I mean it's just so you know if you want to come to Maine you know I'm right here everybody should go to Maine I I just visit visit visit just go in the go in the fall go see the colors change I promise it'll blow your mind and even if you just just google the images and then when when you see the images on google realize that does it doesn't even do it a lick of justice like no it's so much more intense than that yeah it'll it'll blow your mind and it's really the only part of the country that really has that there's a train actually there's a tour train from Boston all the way up like I think there is like a they call it peepers the peeper tour and so it goes all the way up to Maine and then come back down down to Boston so there's so many there's so many tours and attractions or you know companies out there that will take you on a tour through mass Vermont New Hampshire and Maine and see everything I mean but Maine has you know the best lobster so you can still get lobster during that time so and yeah I mean yeah if you guys want to come hang out with me on Instagram I'm there all the time find Trish on Instagram at my sorry I'm sorry holistic real estate

I'm throwing it out there yeah you know that has actually crossed my mind and now it's a sign again I'm like oh Trish you know you should do this I'm like okay so I think you know having myself in my office yeah I could see you building a giant team attracting a lot of other agents if that's what you would want I don't know if you you would even want that but I I could see I could see a lot of people being very very much attracted to your mindset your attitude the way that you approach and I think that would be of tremendous service to other agents also to your clients like here's how to process disappointment here's how to here's how to you know handle the ups and downs I think you have a lot of wisdom that you could provide and again you're doing it to your clients anyway I just
