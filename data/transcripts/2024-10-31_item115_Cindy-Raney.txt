[00:02:26] All right, guys, let's get right to it.
[00:02:27] My conversation with Cindy Rainey.
[00:02:42] Okay, today on the show, my guest is Cindy Rainey from the Cindy Rainey team in Westport,
[00:02:48] Connecticut with Coldwell Banker.
[00:02:50] But let me tell you more about Cindy.
[00:02:52] Now, Cindy Rainey is in a highly accomplished real estate professional,
[00:02:55] having sold over half a billion dollars in residential real estate and earning coldwell bankers
[00:03:00] top honor the International Society of Excellence with a deep commitment to her clients.
[00:03:06] Cindy specializes in luxury properties, relocations, vacation homes,
[00:03:10] and investment properties all across Fairfield County and even other plots of Connecticut.
[00:03:14] She leads a talented team that provides exceptional service through strategic marketing,
[00:03:19] social media, and home staging.
[00:03:21] Cindy's passion extends beyond real estate with active involvement in local nonprofits
[00:03:25] and education.
[00:03:26] As a longtime resident and proud mother of five, I always love that.
[00:03:31] They say if you want to get something done, give it to a busy mother.
[00:03:34] It's right.
[00:03:35] And in addition to being a busy mother of five and a top one percent producer and somebody who
[00:03:40] volunteers in nonprofits, Cindy's dedication to her community and profession is unmatched.
[00:03:45] I would love everybody to go check out Cindy specifically on Instagram.
[00:03:49] Cindy Rainey, A&D team.
[00:03:52] So Cindy Rainey and team and spelled out will have a link to that in the show notes.
[00:03:56] And I also want you to check out her website, Cindy Rainey.com.
[00:04:00] It's a beautiful website.
[00:04:01] If you're looking for inspiration of maybe a website that you would want as an agent yourself.
[00:04:06] I believe this was built by luxury presence and they're a great company.
[00:04:09] So check them out.
[00:04:10] Cindy, welcome to the show.
[00:04:12] Thank you.
[00:04:13] I am happy to be here.
[00:04:15] I just spelled all over myself for the audience.
[00:04:18] Probably won't see that unless they're watching.
[00:04:20] But that is the kind of morning I've been having.
[00:04:23] So I am grateful though that you are making time for us because you don't have time for us.
[00:04:29] And you've made it.
[00:04:31] And I'm super excited to chat with you.
[00:04:34] I really want to, before we get into sort of what you're doing now,
[00:04:38] I want to sort of start at the beginning because people love to hear how you got to where you are.
[00:04:44] So tell us about like, why did you get into real estate and when?
[00:04:49] Okay.
[00:04:50] I got into real estate in 2004.
[00:04:54] And I know that because my son is almost 21 and I was pregnant with Connor when I took my real estate test.
[00:05:01] I had been working in New York City at Merrill Lynch.
[00:05:06] I'd gone through their training program.
[00:05:08] I got my certified financial planner designation.
[00:05:11] We decided to move to the suburbs in, you know, 2001.
[00:05:16] And at that point, I knew I didn't want to continue to commute to the city.
[00:05:21] So my mom had always been in real estate.
[00:05:25] So of course, having a mom in real estate, I felt like I already knew half the job.
[00:05:30] And so it was sort of just a natural fit,
[00:05:32] taking the skills that I learned at Merrill Lynch and using them for sales in real estate.
[00:05:38] Yeah, let's talk about Merrill Lynch because I'm a huge fan of some of the discipline
[00:05:45] that sort of comes from the top down in the training for financial advisors or everyone else
[00:05:51] that works at Merrill Lynch.
[00:05:51] I believe originally Merrill Lynch was founded by guys in the military or it has a very sort of
[00:05:57] disciplined approach to the way they communicate with clients, which I think absolutely transfers over.
[00:06:04] I remember a million years ago, I used to work at Morgan Stanley, so very similar kind of firm.
[00:06:09] And we actually borrowed techniques from Merrill Lynch that were really effective.
[00:06:15] So they would always say with your clients, and again, this is financial advising,
[00:06:18] not being a REALTOR, but probably similar idea is you want your clients to hear from you.
[00:06:23] They would call it a 12-4-1.
[00:06:24] So they would say like every month, they should get something from you, maybe it's a mailer or
[00:06:28] email, whatever. Then it was four times a year you're calling and just kind of giving them an
[00:06:33] update on their investments or whatever. And then once a year is a sit-down, which I always thought
[00:06:38] was like, it's pretty simple, but like what a great idea. So I'm curious if anything that you
[00:06:44] learned over at Merrill Lynch really transferred over to becoming a real estate agent?
[00:06:48] I think it did. And I think that that is one of the keys to my initial success.
[00:06:53] I mean, I'm super competitive by nature to start, but coming out of the city,
[00:07:00] moving back home, I'm from Connecticut, it was a natural fit, and then using the skills that
[00:07:07] I learned there, it really helped me from the beginning have a business plan and structure
[00:07:16] my business with purpose and have a way to communicate with people. It was great.
[00:07:22] And did you find that moving back home, obviously you have family that's in the business?
[00:07:29] Was it challenging to have people start to look at you in a different way, maybe seeing you as
[00:07:35] the financial person and now having to see you in a new life?
[00:07:40] You know, it was so long ago. I haven't even really thought about that. But yes, I think anytime
[00:07:46] you transition from one sort of job to another, one situation to another, you do, you're recreating
[00:07:54] yourself and you're putting yourself out there in a different way. I think today with social
[00:08:00] media the way it is, I think it's like if you roll out a new profession, I mean, it's really out
[00:08:07] there in lights. But I think at that time you just sort of start spreading the word and it didn't
[00:08:12] feel difficult. Plus my mom was a REALTOR. So it sort of felt natural. I didn't work with her.
[00:08:20] I wanted to do it on my own, but I had her support in the early days, for sure.
[00:08:28] Yeah, and you have really, you know, you've sold over 500 million in sales. A lot of that luxury
[00:08:36] properties, of course, the area that you're in, it has a lot of luxury properties for sale. It's
[00:08:42] kind of known for that. A lot of New Yorkers and just people out east kind of maybe migrate away
[00:08:47] from the city over over into Connecticut and then maybe, you know, train it in or bus it in or
[00:08:53] or drive it in. But I'm curious, how was it challenging to break into the luxury market? Because
[00:08:59] there's a very sought after market. It's very highly competitive. Everybody wants to be in luxury.
[00:09:04] So tell me about that process.
[00:09:07] You know, it is hard to break into luxury. And even, you know, now it doesn't
[00:09:14] feel so difficult. But in the beginning, you know, you really have to make sure you are the
[00:09:21] absolute expert in the area you want to work in. So for instance, in Fairfield, Connecticut,
[00:09:27] there's this one street, Sasko Hill Road. And I got my very first listing there probably
[00:09:34] six years ago. And, you know, it was it was interesting. And then I really used that and made sure
[00:09:42] I learned every single, you know, person who lived on the street, I knew, you know, price per square
[00:09:47] foot on the water side versus the non water side. And then it turned into, you know, for other
[00:09:54] listings over the past three years. In fact, that's where I'm running after this. I have a beautiful
[00:10:00] listing at 640 Sasko Hill Road. And we have a third showing. So that would be amazing.
[00:10:07] But yeah, I mean, it's just you really have to be the expert. And you have to be really dedicated
[00:10:13] to your clients and putting, putting their priorities, making their priorities your own. Really?
[00:10:18] I was talking to a top producer here in Chicago, individual agent who's been in the business
[00:10:23] about as long as you have maybe maybe a few years longer, who also does a lot of luxury. And
[00:10:29] she was saying people often think that luxury is this great solution to whatever REALTOR problems
[00:10:36] they may be having, maybe lack of production, getting more clients. And they're like, oh, if I
[00:10:40] just had more luxury deals. And my friend who has done more than half a billion in sales as well
[00:10:48] has said, you know, I'm still up against other REALTORS in almost every listing presentation.
[00:10:54] You know, if it's a referral, then maybe not. But she's like almost always, these are people that are
[00:10:59] doing their due diligence. They are talking to a few different agents. So she's like, I still have
[00:11:03] to eat everything I kill. Like I still have to kill everything I eat. I guess it's a better way to say it.
[00:11:08] So I'm curious is that's got to be a highly competitive space for you. Oh, yeah. I mean,
[00:11:13] there, I would say most people will interview at least two or three agents. I mean, we do have a lot
[00:11:19] of people that are repeat clients or come to us like a strong referral from somebody and then
[00:11:26] they're not interviewing. But, you know, I take my business very seriously. And part of what
[00:11:34] helps keep us really on track is I strongly believe in coaching. I mean, hands down coaching is like
[00:11:41] one of the number one things that's really helped me especially the last five years grow tremendously.
[00:11:47] But, you know, I have a speaking coach. I mean, all we do is talk to people. Wow. So you don't
[00:11:52] just have a REALTOR coach. You have a speaking give. So you have multiple coaches? Yes, I do. I have,
[00:11:59] you know, my, yeah, my overall business coach. And then I have a separate speaking coach. Because
[00:12:05] I mean, four or five years ago, I would not have wanted to get on a stage or get on a podcast. Or,
[00:12:13] I mean, if you could see my initial videos on Instagram or the first time I tried to make a video
[00:12:21] for my website, I couldn't do it. I mean, it was so hard. And I was so stiff. I mean, it was like,
[00:12:28] you know, the, I would, the way I was talking, it just wasn't natural. And, uh, yeah, so I need to,
[00:12:34] and then like personally, I have a yoga coach. It's like, I'm coached everywhere so that I can be,
[00:12:40] I mean, we're all running around like crazy. You need something to normalcy.
[00:12:45] You almost need like, we all need a bit of a council around us, right? Like, um, I have a
[00:12:51] council of elders or something. I've got, so same thing. I've got, um, well, I don't have a business
[00:12:57] coach right now, but what I do, I actually do have a business coach. So I have a business coach,
[00:13:01] personal trainer, um, and, uh, you know, an accountant and, and, you know, obviously lots of other,
[00:13:07] other people that assist me. But I love vocal coach because number one, yes, you are communicating to,
[00:13:13] you know, it one on one or in front of groups, you know, when you're at the level you're at, you get
[00:13:18] invited to speak in front of your, your very sought after. So lots of people want to hear the Cindy
[00:13:23] Rainey story. And, you know, speaking in front of people is not the same as one on one and it can be
[00:13:28] quite, quite scary. And also, but I love that I love that you're willing to do it. You're
[00:13:34] willing to do the hard stuff. And it's, you know, speaking in public, uh, speaking on this podcast,
[00:13:39] it's not easy. I don't think it's easy. And I've done it for a long time. So maybe it sounds natural
[00:13:45] to me, but I don't believe that it's easy to keep some of these attention for 45 minutes. Um, and
[00:13:50] yet I have to do that every single episode or do my best. And so having a coach is critical, I think,
[00:13:56] and it's so easy to forget as a non, uh, a non high end producer that getting a coach now is just
[00:14:06] as important as Cindy. It's easy to say, well, Cindy's a huge producer. She can afford to,
[00:14:11] to have all of these coaches in her life. Well, maybe, um, but every athlete has a coach and every
[00:14:18] athlete, professional athlete has coaches their entire history before they ever made a dollar. So,
[00:14:24] the importance of coaching, I love that, that you're into that. What does your coach help you to do
[00:14:29] or coaches? Well, I, you know, I was just going to say, I remember the day that I said to my husband,
[00:14:33] Jason, like, Hey, this is probably going back five or six years. I said, I think I want to do
[00:14:38] coaching. And I felt like it was kind of hokey. I was like, I was like, almost embarrassed to be,
[00:14:43] like, Hey, I think I want to do this. And at that point, I think it was like $750 a month.
[00:14:49] And I know what I said, I know it's a huge investment, but I want to try it. And we've, we've grown
[00:14:56] so much from that day. And my coaches have grown. So you don't stay with the same coach. Like, you grow,
[00:15:02] you get the next level of coach and, you know, progress is from there. Um, but, you know, you don't
[00:15:08] need to be making a ton of money to start investing in your business. I mean, I think for,
[00:15:13] for people that want to grow their business, that is the number one place to start, you know,
[00:15:19] you should hire an assistant to help you do the things that you're not good at or that you don't
[00:15:23] like to do and spend time on like meeting people being out there, the things that you are really good at.
[00:15:30] Um, and, and you should just invest in yourself early on.
[00:15:34] Yeah, I'll tell you what I have an assistant doing. So a lot of us, again, are thinking, I can't
[00:15:38] afford an assistant. Well, I have an assistant who lives in another part of the world. She's been with
[00:15:42] me for, for years. She's a lot less expensive than perhaps somebody would charge me here in the
[00:15:49] United States. But, you know, I can afford what I can afford. And as a result, I, um, so just today,
[00:15:55] this is kind of funny. So I don't practice real estate myself. I recruit REALTORS. So it's kind
[00:16:00] of similar in a sense. I'm reaching out to people trying to see if they'd have interest in joining
[00:16:05] our firm. Well, one of the things I realized was, uh, and again, if anyone who's listening in our
[00:16:10] local market, I apologize for pulling the curtain back on this, but just to show you what it, what
[00:16:13] somebody can do is I have an entire list of people I'm trying to prospect or that I'd like to
[00:16:19] eventually become an agent at our firm. And they're at other firms right now. And so what we're
[00:16:24] doing is we're tracking all of their production. And whenever they do something cool or do something
[00:16:28] important, we call this a relative, something impressive. Uh, even if it's just impressive to us,
[00:16:33] we're, we're sending them an email or I'm calling. And so what my assistant does, it's just one
[00:16:38] hour a day. I only pay her for one hour a day of this. She finds 20 of these opportunities, like,
[00:16:44] hey, this person just listed as crazy new listing. We should congratulate them and say, hey,
[00:16:48] we're watching you like, this is really cool. Like, good luck. And all of these ways to let people
[00:16:53] know that we care about them and that we're paying attention. And she just loads up 20 emails. She
[00:16:58] couple sentences each. And then I go through at the end of the day, I review each one to make sure
[00:17:02] it sounds like my voice and I can make changes. And she's been with me for years. So she knows my
[00:17:06] voice. And it would be just work. I would be doing anyway. And I have to review it and approve it.
[00:17:12] And I send it out. And it really does come from me. She just starts it. And it's, it's like the
[00:17:17] best money I can possibly spend because I can't spend that time coming up with 20 different
[00:17:23] reasons to reach out to these agents because it's just too much time to go through. So I,
[00:17:28] I love that. Yeah. That's a great way to have her use her, you know, time. And it's great that
[00:17:35] you can do that. And by the way, if anyone out there who has a team and is looking to build a team,
[00:17:41] use the strategy I just mentioned because if you want to poach somebody from a different team or
[00:17:46] if you just want to add to your team, you know, look for those agents that you want and start
[00:17:50] following them and paying attention to what they do on the MLS and, and I'll swear. And I assure you
[00:17:55] that probably their own managing broker is calling them to congratulate them on all their sales.
[00:18:00] That's a great idea. It's true. It's a great idea. Yeah. Do you get a lot of phone calls from,
[00:18:06] from, you know, because you're your own thing. People probably just let Cindy do her own thing,
[00:18:10] leave her alone. Yeah. It's nice to get. It's nice to get. It's nice to have someone say,
[00:18:16] hey, I noticed you just put up that great listing on people love praise. They love to know that
[00:18:21] you're, you know, noticing them. I think that's really smart. I think I'm going to do that
[00:18:26] when we start our next recruiting effort. There you go. And check out Cindy's listings too.
[00:18:33] On Cindy Rainey dot com. It's just super impressive. I think I always like to demystify
[00:18:39] a lot of times, you know, and I do this in my own life too. I'm like, if I only had that one thing,
[00:18:43] I'd be happy. I'd be successful. I'd be at. And oftentimes that one thing seems like it's the
[00:18:48] solution to whatever problem. And it may be it is, but oftentimes it's not. And so I'm curious on
[00:18:54] everybody wants to do luxury, you know, it's highly competitive. Obviously the commissions are high.
[00:18:59] But there's downsides to it. And I don't only one says downsides, there's unappealing parts of working
[00:19:04] in the luxury market as well. Number one, highly competitive. Obviously, number two,
[00:19:10] you have to really know your stuff. Maybe more so than, you know, a client at a lower price point
[00:19:16] that isn't being fought over as much in the marketplace. And number three, just, you know,
[00:19:23] having to outperform the other agents in your marketplace. So tell us, you know, what to,
[00:19:32] so you talked about, you know, I need to really know my data, my stats. What else is really important
[00:19:40] about, you know, keeping a keeping a luxury client happy, making sure that throughout the process,
[00:19:46] that, you know, what are you doing along the way to ensure that by the end of the process,
[00:19:50] they're like, wow, Cindy was the best. Yeah. You know, I think the most important thing is to find out
[00:19:55] how your client wants to communicate with you. And by asking them what they want. So do you want,
[00:20:02] do you want me to communicate with you by text, email, phone call, how often do you want me to
[00:20:07] update you? Because some people might want to be updated weekly. Like, for instance, my listing
[00:20:14] at Sasko Hill, they're not, they're not living here now. They live in Florida. But I still need to
[00:20:20] give him updates regularly. So it's important that I know the cadence of which he wants updates
[00:20:26] from me so that he's happy. You know, and I think just making sure that you're really available when
[00:20:34] somebody wants to talk to you. I mean, there are so many agents, well, I shouldn't say that. I
[00:20:39] think there are people just in general, you know, that are not looking at email consistently or don't
[00:20:45] respond quickly. That's one of my biggest pet peeves. I think if you're in service and you're working
[00:20:50] with someone for someone, you've got to be available. Yeah, we should also mention too. We didn't
[00:20:56] mention this. But Cindy's coach is, she works with the Tom Ferry coaching company. So if anyone's
[00:21:02] wondering, who does the top people use? Cindy uses Tom Ferry's company and obviously very
[00:21:07] well-respected people probably know Tom Ferry and his father Mike Ferry. They are one of the top
[00:21:15] two of the top two coaching companies out there. I want to talk a little bit about consistency
[00:21:21] because look, you're a busy, busy mom, you're a wife, you are a REALTOR, you're a team lead,
[00:21:27] and you're a producer on top of all of that. How do you maintain consistency with all of the
[00:21:35] complexity of your life? I'm really lucky that I have a team and I think having the team and
[00:21:42] having a schedule that we try to keep to allows me to have flexibility in my life and allows me to
[00:21:49] continue. So I'm not by nature the most organized person. So I've got an assistant who sits right
[00:21:57] next to me in my office. She's not here right now, but she keeps me on task and helps me with my
[00:22:04] calendar, with emails and things like that. We've got a full team, we've got a team of nine,
[00:22:10] we've got a marketing director, we've got several agents, we've got a social media director,
[00:22:17] you know, and things that are really important to stay consistent with would be our monthly newsletter.
[00:22:23] It goes out monthly, no matter what it happens, and every month we put a lot of time into it.
[00:22:30] It's interesting. People love it. We really, like, brainstorm about what we're going to give people
[00:22:36] on the market. We give them market insights, and we don't just spit out the numbers. We really think
[00:22:41] about it. I mean, it's like we, Jason is actually, he's my husband, he's my business partner,
[00:22:47] and his role on the team other than being our visionary, he's our numbers guy, he knows
[00:22:54] everything inside and out, so we all work together to put that together.
[00:22:58] And something like video, for instance, if you're going to put yourself out there on social media,
[00:23:03] you have to be consistent because people will start to expect to see you, and they will
[00:23:11] enjoy getting the information you're giving them. So consistency in anything you're doing,
[00:23:17] you've got to be, you know, to be great, you've got to be consistent.
[00:23:20] Yeah, let's talk about social media. So, you know, a lot of times agents in the luxury space,
[00:23:26] or people who want to get into the luxury space might think, well, maybe luxury,
[00:23:30] maybe luxury does, means I don't have to do a lot of social media because maybe it's been seen
[00:23:37] as that's more of a relationship play, and, you know, I don't know whether there's
[00:23:43] credence to that or not, but you are doing a lot of social media. So, tell us about the kind of
[00:23:48] content that you like to consistently do on social media that really helps, you know,
[00:23:53] personify the brand and help get people interested in you.
[00:23:56] Yeah, I think so what we do is we post every day, once a day on our posts, and then, you know,
[00:24:06] on stories, it's a different approach, but so we have a theme, it's like market Mondays,
[00:24:11] we talk about the market, tips Tuesdays, so it could be something, you know, like right now,
[00:24:19] it would be something in our community, and we would go somewhere like somebody on my team would go
[00:24:24] talk about where they've been, or like if you're going to go apple picking with your kids,
[00:24:28] where you'd go, it's just things people want to know. So, we have a schedule throughout the week.
[00:24:33] More than happy to share the inside, you know, list with anybody. If you want a DM me, feel free,
[00:24:40] I can give you sort of our cadence. And then on the stories, we sort of just keep whatever we
[00:24:47] want to talk about sort of like the day in the life of what's happening. So, like this weekend,
[00:24:52] I played paddle, we put that out on stories, you know, just trying to think like whatever is
[00:24:58] current and whatever we're doing as a team. And, you know, we always put our listings out there
[00:25:04] in obviously with the highest, you know, video quality. And it's really important to continually
[00:25:12] put your listings out there. So, we just have a cadence for every listing that it gets posted
[00:25:17] a certain number of times. And, you know, everybody will see it. I mean, we have with our new listing,
[00:25:23] I mean, everyone's saying I've we've never seen this listing before until you took it over.
[00:25:27] And now we're going to sell it. It's a $12 million listing. It had been on before for five years
[00:25:32] and hadn't sold. And we've got more traffic now because we took our formula and our, you know,
[00:25:39] rolling out our social media program. We should also mention too, getting a $12 million listing in
[00:25:44] most cases is not just throwing it up on the MLS and waiting for the, the, the showings to come rolling
[00:25:51] in because well, you know, there's not many people that play in that space. And not a lot of buyers
[00:25:56] just going, I'm just waiting around for a $12 million property to jump on the market. So, Cindy
[00:26:00] has a really tough job as a listing agent for these high end properties because she has to go
[00:26:05] find the buyers, which means she's got to have great relationships with other real tools who
[00:26:11] represent buyers in that space. She's got to know where those other buyers hang out, you know,
[00:26:16] online or even in person. So, she's got to flood the market. So, tell us a little bit about when
[00:26:22] you have a property like that, that is so, you know, just, just so specific and really, you know,
[00:26:28] less than 1% of the population would even, you know, be able to have that property.
[00:26:33] You know, how do you go about sort of figuring out how do we get this thing sold?
[00:26:38] You know, I think the most important thing that we have is a vast network. And it starts with our
[00:26:44] network at GlobalBanker. Part of why we're here is they have a global luxury program. And that
[00:26:53] gives us amazing marketing. Plus, it also gives us global reach. And that's really important
[00:26:58] because, you know, we know we know where the buyers are coming from today for these properties.
[00:27:02] We've done the research. And we really hit those areas around the world by reaching out to those
[00:27:10] agents with our marketing to make sure that they know that this listing exists.
[00:27:16] So, this just to interject for a second. So, we're not talking about, hey, all of the wealthy people
[00:27:21] at the country club in your local market who may be able to afford that property and just
[00:27:27] don't know what's up for sale. We're talking about people that move into the area, maybe from New
[00:27:31] York City, maybe from Florida, maybe from the West Coast, maybe who have other properties elsewhere.
[00:27:38] This is, you are really having to think about exactly where your buyers come from. And they,
[00:27:44] like you said, could be global. Yeah, no, it's, it is. And we definitely reach out to
[00:27:50] our contacts and make a personal phone call. I mean, I'm friends with people literally
[00:27:57] around the globe and say, like, hey, this is a great house. If you've got someone who's looking for
[00:28:02] something of this style, you should definitely show it to them. And what's also interesting is,
[00:28:10] you know, real estate doesn't happen in a vacuum. I mean, it's like everything we do here is
[00:28:14] is really hyper local, but you also need to know what's happening globally, nationally, you've
[00:28:21] got to know what's happening in other parts of the country because buyers at this level,
[00:28:25] they own several different homes. They probably have something, you know, an Aspen Miami. I mean,
[00:28:31] they're, they're, their homeowners in many different places. So it really helps to stay current
[00:28:37] on everything that's happening. I love that. You know, I wanted to talk switch gears just a little
[00:28:43] bit because I don't think we could ever over communicate about the importance of hard work. And
[00:28:51] I know that it's such a simple thing to say, such a hard thing to do. It's like a push up. It's
[00:28:56] like a really good idea to do a push up. It's not a lot of fun to do a push up, but it's a really
[00:29:00] good idea to do squats, push ups, you know, the things that kind of are a little painful. But if we
[00:29:05] want a healthy body, we probably need to do those things or we need to do some of those things.
[00:29:09] And hard work is, you know, obviously being a successful real stage and there's, there's no
[00:29:15] short cut to hard work that I've found. And I asked once that one of the top individual producers,
[00:29:20] actually the team, top team here in Chicago, but the team lead. I said, why do you think you're
[00:29:25] at the very, very top? Like, what do you think you do differently? He's like, I swear to God, he
[00:29:29] goes, he said, DJ, I swear to you, I just work harder than everyone. He's like, that's literally it.
[00:29:34] He goes, I'm not smarter. I'm not better. He's like, maybe I'm better because I've been doing it
[00:29:38] longer, but he's like, it's all because of hard work. So I'm curious. Let's, I'd love to hear
[00:29:42] your thoughts about hard work. Yeah. I mean, it is, it is hard. This job is hard. I mean, the people
[00:29:48] that say, oh, I'm going to get into real estate because the schedule is flexible and it's an
[00:29:53] easy thing to do. It is hard. It is, it's like, it's a 24 seven job. And until you get to the point
[00:30:01] where you can surround yourself with a team, you're working all the time, all the time. So,
[00:30:08] you know, in the beginning, you know, all you have to sit open houses like do two on Saturday,
[00:30:15] two on Sunday, you know, take desk duty every time you can get it, you know, constantly market and
[00:30:22] put yourself out there. Do mailings, all of these things until you, you know, have a name for
[00:30:27] yourself. But I mean, I work hard every day all day now, even though we have the team, but it's
[00:30:34] a little bit easier because it's a little more organized. I, you know, I just took my mom and my
[00:30:40] two girls to Paris a week and a half ago. And it nobody skipped to be. It was fine. We put two
[00:30:46] listings on and it was great because I have this super strong team behind me. I was always available,
[00:30:53] but it can run without me here in the moment, which is amazing. Yeah. Well, gosh,
[00:31:01] that's impressive. I suspect being a mom of five and team lead and and producer as well,
[00:31:07] that you, you would have to know when you wake up every day. I know I have a plan for the day.
[00:31:13] And can we talk about how do you set that plan? Because what you, what you're accomplishing to you,
[00:31:20] maybe it's like, well, this is just what I do. To everybody else, they see you as like an alien.
[00:31:24] Like, how are you able to do all of this? So I'm curious just with the planning of the day. How do
[00:31:29] you think about planning the day? Because there's so much chaos in your life, you have to have a plan.
[00:31:33] Yes. So I mean, a couple of things. I, I learned a few years ago that I used to say all the time,
[00:31:41] like, I'm, I'm busy, I'm busy, I'm busy. And that was sort of like, like, my go to phrase. And I
[00:31:47] was really good at multitasking. But now, you know, I turned 50 recently. I can't multitask as well.
[00:31:55] So I have to stay super organized. So my day is pretty much the same every day. I wake up,
[00:32:02] I make my latte downstairs. It's like, first thing I have to have every morning. I spend about a
[00:32:08] half hour really getting ready for my day, checking emails, making sure I'm ready for any listing
[00:32:13] appointments, anything I have. And my 13 year old daughter goes to school about a half hour away
[00:32:20] from us. I could put her on a bus, but like, she's my last child at home. And I love that time with
[00:32:27] her. So I drive her to school. We listen to Taylor Swift. We talk. We like get ready for the day.
[00:32:32] And then I, then from, at once I drop her, I come right to the office and we have our team meeting,
[00:32:37] our team huddle. And then I work really from, you know, nine to about three. And then the rest of
[00:32:44] the day from three on, I'm back on like family time, fully available. But I'm back to, you know,
[00:32:52] picking up CC from practice, bringing her something somewhere to a tutor. And then I'll get back on
[00:32:58] the computer maybe around seven. Yeah. And then our, how much sleep do you get? Because you,
[00:33:05] sleep has got to be a luxury for you. No, I can tell you exactly how much because I've been
[00:33:10] wearing my Apple watch literally every day since I got back from Paris. I'm a little obsessed with
[00:33:14] my amount of sleep right now. I've been getting like eight and a half hours of sleep. And I'm,
[00:33:19] I now need to like do a deeper dive because there's like core sleep, deep sleep, REM sleep.
[00:33:25] And I need to figure out what it all means. But I'm like last night, it got seven and a half hours,
[00:33:30] but I still feel okay. But my average is like eight and a half hours of sleep, which I think
[00:33:34] is pretty good. That's more than a little bit good. That is, that is crazy. But again, it requires
[00:33:42] for you to even to get eight and a half hours of sleep or seven and a half hours. It requires a
[00:33:46] ton of organization. It requires a discipline of, I need to go to bed at this time. I need to wake up
[00:33:51] at this time. Obviously, as a mom, you have to wake up and you have responsibilities for the family.
[00:33:55] And, but I love to that at three o'clock every day, there's a time from three to seven.
[00:34:00] It's mom time. It's family time. I'm here. I'm present. And then I can, you know, do my work in
[00:34:05] the evening. Should I, should I have any? And then I get to go to bed at a, wow, you have,
[00:34:10] you maybe have the most balanced life I've ever heard of from a producer of your level.
[00:34:16] It hasn't been this way always. And I'm really lucky because I work with my husband. And like,
[00:34:22] we have different offices. So we're not in the same place. We do different things. We stay in our
[00:34:25] lane. I learned what that meant early on when we started working together. But I, it has not
[00:34:31] always been this way. I missed countless soccer games. I mean, when I was in my 30s, late 30s,
[00:34:39] like there were, I didn't even see my kids on the weekends. You know, so I mean, it, I put the time
[00:34:44] in. And I think it was important for my kids to see that I did that. And they are really
[00:34:51] respect hard work. I've got a child who he's turning 21. He's going to graduate in three years
[00:34:59] from Babs and College. And he's trying, he's going to grad school. I mean, he is so, he's such a
[00:35:05] hard worker. Like they're all such hard workers. I'm so proud of all of them. Yeah, it's just,
[00:35:11] it's, it's right now being a mom, it is my mom and being a part of the family. That's like my
[00:35:17] why. That's why I do everything that I do. So I make sure that that I make that a priority as well
[00:35:22] as obviously taking care of my clients. And then thirdly giving back to our community because
[00:35:28] we can. And it's really important to me. Yeah, let's talk about giving back. So why is giving back
[00:35:34] important and what does that mean to you? You know, I think that by giving back to other people,
[00:35:42] I mean, it's, it, it makes you feel good. First of all, that when you can help other people,
[00:35:47] and there are so many people, we're in a community that's right next to a town that people are,
[00:35:54] they do not have everything that they need. And the fact that we can help people in so many
[00:36:01] different ways, it means the world. I mean, there's so many different ways you can help today.
[00:36:07] But I have a child who had struggled with anxiety and depression for a little bit. And I know that
[00:36:13] there are people that don't have resources. So part of what we're doing, we work with Bridgeport
[00:36:18] Hospital. We have just been able to give a tremendous amount of money throughout committee that I'm
[00:36:25] on. The reward that I'm on to help handle situations when kids come in, those teenagers who are
[00:36:32] just anxious or depressed so that they're not put with the adults. I mean, there's, there's so many
[00:36:37] different causes out there. But that is something that's like near and dear to me. And I just want to
[00:36:43] be able to help as much as I can. Yeah, I think about right now, teen girls in particular with social
[00:36:49] media, it's got to be brutal. I can't imagine seeing perfection and images, it's seeing things that
[00:36:57] they're not, it's real, but it looks real. And it looks like, oh, I don't look like that or I don't
[00:37:03] have that life or I don't have that thing or I don't have that friend group or I didn't get to go
[00:37:08] to that party and look at all the pictures. And that would have leveled me as a kid. I know we're
[00:37:12] getting off track. But so it's so true. I know it's so true. I'm so glad that I did not have that
[00:37:19] growing. Oh, me too. Oh my god. It would be horrible. It would have ruined me to know on Monday that
[00:37:25] I didn't get invited to a party. I would know I would hear about it on Monday. Oh, I didn't get
[00:37:30] invited. But it wasn't in your face. It wasn't it wasn't my feet. Yeah, I didn't see the pictures of
[00:37:35] every so. So yeah, let's have let's have a lot of compassion and empathy for those teens,
[00:37:41] you know, boys and girls that are dealing with. I hope in the next few generations,
[00:37:45] there'll be a rejection of some of that stuff. Maybe we can use social media more effectively.
[00:37:51] Yeah. But anyway, I also want to talk a little bit about where you struggle because every
[00:37:59] successful person, nobody's perfect. Everyone's got problems. I have problems. You have problems.
[00:38:03] And certainly not looking to do a deep dive into all of your problems. But just so that people know
[00:38:08] you're human, what is what is one part of your business that isn't as perfect as you would like
[00:38:13] it to be? Gosh, I think that something that we have struggled with and what we're working
[00:38:22] toward is real processes for things. And so every time I feel like we have a process for something,
[00:38:31] we all we have to always like continue to come back to it because, you know, we have a team and
[00:38:39] if we're not on top of everything exactly the way it needs to be, you know, so we need to know
[00:38:44] like who's ordering the sign, who's putting the listing in, who's doing this. And it's an evolution
[00:38:50] of making sure everybody's working the way they need to. And I think the other struggle is
[00:38:59] sometimes if I'm the final word on something, I can be the person holding up a project.
[00:39:05] Sure. And I realize that and I need to make sure that I'm giving enough of my time to
[00:39:14] projects that might be really important to my marketing manager. I mean, they're, you know,
[00:39:20] working really hard and I don't want to be the person holding them up.
[00:39:24] Yeah, I love that. Just more organization. It sounds like it more, it's constant, constant
[00:39:30] refinement, right? And balance is imposs- balance is impossible. So it's more about getting as close
[00:39:36] to balance as you can. There's no work like balance. There's no work like balance. There's no
[00:39:41] I mean, you just you're in it and you just do the best you can. One last question. Let's say,
[00:39:47] and I know you are constantly, you know, you have a big team, you constantly have clients, clients
[00:39:53] are probably always are dealing with clients. But let's just say you had a time where you didn't have
[00:40:00] any listings or buyers in a particular day. What might you do that day? Would it be any different
[00:40:07] from any other day or what would you do? Because there's lots of people out there right now that
[00:40:11] maybe aren't don't have clients. And I'm just curious, would that change your day at all? Or would
[00:40:16] it be just don't put my head down and keep doing the same stuff? If I, I mean, look, I'm a warrior
[00:40:21] by nature. So if I don't have a lot in the pipeline, I am always working toward keeping the
[00:40:29] pipeline going. So I would say if you didn't have something today, you know, you just literally
[00:40:36] go back to your database. More clients come from your existing database. I wouldn't go out and
[00:40:43] try to find new people. I would go back to your database. There's some crazy statistic that's
[00:40:48] something like 80% of the people that bought during COVID are not happy in their home. Like start there.
[00:40:56] So start calling people that bought a house during COVID and tell them like, look, you know, a lot
[00:41:00] of people rushed into a purchase. You're not crazy if you don't love your house. They may be
[00:41:06] they overpaid. Yeah, maybe I keep there's, but that's a great place to start. Also, I would, I always
[00:41:14] just go to my phone and I start calling A to Z. So I know where I've left off and you just pick
[00:41:21] up the phone and you actually make a phone call, not a text, not an email, say, hi, how are you?
[00:41:27] Talk to them about something, you know, right now, interest rates, I mean, they're they're up a
[00:41:33] little bit more than they were a couple weeks ago, but we called all of our clients the bought a house.
[00:41:38] Finally, it's a reasonable. Yeah. They were and they, some of these people saved anywhere from like,
[00:41:44] you know, 20 to $40,000 a year just by refinancing in that quick moment that they could.
[00:41:51] So, you know, I weren't open book. Like if anybody ever wants to get ideas from us, please DM
[00:41:59] me through Instagram and we will get back to you with, you know, video ideas. We've got our social
[00:42:06] media ideas, some of our processes like the one thing I will say is that I've surrounded myself with
[00:42:13] amazing people and I've mastered my groups. I didn't invent all of this. I learned a lot from
[00:42:19] so many other people and I'm happy to, you know, spread what I've learned from other people and share it.
[00:42:27] So, well, city, what, what a great place to, to wrap up, Cindy Rainey.com is where you can learn
[00:42:34] about all things. Cindy, again, please check out her website. Notice how clean and crisp and

[00:43:03] and team on Instagram will have a link in the show notes. And Cindy, one last question for you.
[00:43:08] If you were a brand new agent starting today, still knowing everything you know,
[00:43:14] well, or let's just say a different way, you, you, you had to move to another state in a
[00:43:19] place where you didn't know anybody and you had to start over. What would you do day one if we
[00:43:24] plucked you out and threw you in the middle of Iowa, for example? Okay, I would, first of all,
[00:43:32] learn everything I could about the market. I would just study, study, study the market. I would
[00:43:36] go out, I would see all of the inventory. So, become the expert day one. Take hours and just drive
[00:43:43] around, learn everything you can. And I would probably join a team of some sort day one to align
[00:43:52] myself with other experts. And I think by doing that, I think you can very quickly start getting
[00:43:58] listings. And from there, it all trickles down. And listings are really the key to driving business.
[00:44:06] And today's market. So it's possible. And making sure you're on social media as the expert.
[00:44:12] And I'm going to add a tack on because I know Cindy would, would say this open houses,
[00:44:17] too, who's especially if you have a tea, if you join a team, bag, borrow or steal, get those
[00:44:22] open houses, even if it's not your listing, bag them, please, please, please, let me do open houses.
[00:44:28] But the, the expert at the open house, we're treating every single thing about that house.
[00:44:33] Somebody can't say like, oh, does it have this kind of heating? You have to like know exactly,
[00:44:37] and know, know what like it's your own home. I love that. Know what like it's your own home.
[00:44:42] Know the story of the home, too. Is there a story that goes on? Yeah. That, I mean, that's how we
[00:44:47] sell. I think so many homes. There's an emotional piece to every listing and you're telling the story
[00:44:54] of the house and why it's so great. You're making an emotional connection with the house, with the
[00:45:00] buyer, and that's really been such a key for us. Well, Cindy, thank you so much. I want to have
[00:45:07] everybody again, follow Cindy on Instagram, Cindy Rainey and team, Cindy Rainey.com is where you can
[00:45:12] learn about all things. Cindy and she is so generous. She says, DM her with questions, ask her for
[00:45:18] some of the, you know, the, the processes they use, maybe some templates. Cindy is such a sweet
[00:45:24] nice person and she's willing to pay it forward because people helped her when she started as well.
[00:45:28] On behalf of our audience, thank you, Cindy. Again, you don't have time for this. That's the
[00:45:33] social pleasure. Thank you. I'm so happy to be here today. Thank you. I am so happy you were here as

Okay, today on the show, my guest is Cindy Rainey from the Cindy Rainey team in Westport, Connecticut with Coldwell Banker. But let me tell you more about Cindy. Now, Cindy Rainey is in a highly accomplished real estate professional, having sold over half a billion dollars in residential real estate and earning coldwell bankers top honor the International Society of Excellence with a deep commitment to her clients. Cindy specializes in luxury properties, relocations, vacation homes, and investment properties all across Fairfield County and even other plots of Connecticut. She leads a talented team that provides exceptional service through strategic marketing, social media, and home staging. Cindy's passion extends beyond real estate with active involvement in local nonprofits and education. As a longtime resident and proud mother of five, I always love that. They say if you want to get something done, give it to a busy mother. It's right. And in addition to being a busy mother of five and a top one percent producer and somebody who volunteers in nonprofits, Cindy's dedication to her community and profession is unmatched. I would love everybody to go check out Cindy specifically on Instagram. Cindy Rainey, A&D team. So Cindy Rainey and team and spelled out will have a link to that in the show notes. And I also want you to check out her website, Cindy Rainey.com. It's a beautiful website. If you're looking for inspiration of maybe a website that you would want as an agent yourself. I believe this was built by luxury presence and they're a great company. So check them out. Cindy, welcome to the show. Thank you. I am happy to be here. I just spelled all over myself for the audience. Probably won't see that unless they're watching. But that is the kind of morning I've been having. So I am grateful though that you are making time for us because you don't have time for us. And you've made it. And I'm super excited to chat with you. I really want to, before we get into sort of what you're doing now, I want to sort of start at the beginning because people love to hear how you got to where you are. So tell us about like, why did you get into real estate and when? Okay. I got into real estate in 2004. And I know that because my son is almost 21 and I was pregnant with Connor when I took my real estate test. I had been working in New York City at Merrill Lynch. I'd gone through their training program. I got my certified financial planner designation. We decided to move to the suburbs in, you know, 2001. And at that point, I knew I didn't want to continue to commute to the city. So my mom had always been in real estate. So of course, having a mom in real estate, I felt like I already knew half the job. And so it was sort of just a natural fit, taking the skills that I learned at Merrill Lynch and using them for sales in real estate. Yeah, let's talk about Merrill Lynch because I'm a huge fan of some of the discipline that sort of comes from the top down in the training for financial advisors or everyone else that works at Merrill Lynch. I believe originally Merrill Lynch was founded by guys in the military or it has a very sort of disciplined approach to the way they communicate with clients, which I think absolutely transfers over. I remember a million years ago, I used to work at Morgan Stanley, so very similar kind of firm. And we actually borrowed techniques from Merrill Lynch that were really effective. So they would always say with your clients, and again, this is financial advising, not being a REALTOR, but probably similar idea is you want your clients to hear from you. They would call it a 12-4-1. So they would say like every month, they should get something from you, maybe it's a mailer or email, whatever. Then it was four times a year you're calling and just kind of giving them an update on their investments or whatever. And then once a year is a sit-down, which I always thought was like, it's pretty simple, but like what a great idea. So I'm curious if anything that you learned over at Merrill Lynch really transferred over to becoming a real estate agent? I think it did. And I think that that is one of the keys to my initial success. I mean, I'm super competitive by nature to start, but coming out of the city, moving back home, I'm from Connecticut, it was a natural fit, and then using the skills that I learned there, it really helped me from the beginning have a business plan and structure my business with purpose and have a way to communicate with people. It was great. And did you find that moving back home, obviously you have family that's in the business? Was it challenging to have people start to look at you in a different way, maybe seeing you as the financial person and now having to see you in a new life? You know, it was so long ago. I haven't even really thought about that. But yes, I think anytime you transition from one sort of job to another, one situation to another, you do, you're recreating yourself and you're putting yourself out there in a different way. I think today with social media the way it is, I think it's like if you roll out a new profession, I mean, it's really out there in lights. But I think at that time you just sort of start spreading the word and it didn't feel difficult. Plus my mom was a REALTOR. So it sort of felt natural. I didn't work with her. I wanted to do it on my own, but I had her support in the early days, for sure. Yeah, and you have really, you know, you've sold over 500 million in sales. A lot of that luxury properties, of course, the area that you're in, it has a lot of luxury properties for sale. It's kind of known for that. A lot of New Yorkers and just people out east kind of maybe migrate away from the city over over into Connecticut and then maybe, you know, train it in or bus it in or or drive it in. But I'm curious, how was it challenging to break into the luxury market? Because there's a very sought after market. It's very highly competitive. Everybody wants to be in luxury. So tell me about that process. You know, it is hard to break into luxury. And even, you know, now it doesn't feel so difficult. But in the beginning, you know, you really have to make sure you are the absolute expert in the area you want to work in. So for instance, in Fairfield, Connecticut, there's this one street, Sasko Hill Road. And I got my very first listing there probably six years ago. And, you know, it was it was interesting. And then I really used that and made sure I learned every single, you know, person who lived on the street, I knew, you know, price per square foot on the water side versus the non water side. And then it turned into, you know, for other listings over the past three years. In fact, that's where I'm running after this. I have a beautiful listing at 640 Sasko Hill Road. And we have a third showing. So that would be amazing. But yeah, I mean, it's just you really have to be the expert. And you have to be really dedicated to your clients and putting, putting their priorities, making their priorities your own. Really? I was talking to a top producer here in Chicago, individual agent who's been in the business about as long as you have maybe maybe a few years longer, who also does a lot of luxury. And she was saying people often think that luxury is this great solution to whatever REALTOR problems they may be having, maybe lack of production, getting more clients. And they're like, oh, if I just had more luxury deals. And my friend who has done more than half a billion in sales as well has said, you know, I'm still up against other REALTORS in almost every listing presentation. You know, if it's a referral, then maybe not. But she's like almost always, these are people that are doing their due diligence. They are talking to a few different agents. So she's like, I still have to eat everything I kill. Like I still have to kill everything I eat. I guess it's a better way to say it. So I'm curious is that's got to be a highly competitive space for you. Oh, yeah. I mean, there, I would say most people will interview at least two or three agents. I mean, we do have a lot of people that are repeat clients or come to us like a strong referral from somebody and then they're not interviewing. But, you know, I take my business very seriously. And part of what helps keep us really on track is I strongly believe in coaching. I mean, hands down coaching is like one of the number one things that's really helped me especially the last five years grow tremendously. But, you know, I have a speaking coach. I mean, all we do is talk to people. Wow. So you don't just have a REALTOR coach. You have a speaking give. So you have multiple coaches? Yes, I do. I have, you know, my, yeah, my overall business coach. And then I have a separate speaking coach. Because I mean, four or five years ago, I would not have wanted to get on a stage or get on a podcast. Or, I mean, if you could see my initial videos on Instagram or the first time I tried to make a video for my website, I couldn't do it. I mean, it was so hard. And I was so stiff. I mean, it was like, you know, the, I would, the way I was talking, it just wasn't natural. And, uh, yeah, so I need to, and then like personally, I have a yoga coach. It's like, I'm coached everywhere so that I can be, I mean, we're all running around like crazy. You need something to normalcy. You almost need like, we all need a bit of a council around us, right? Like, um, I have a council of elders or something. I've got, so same thing. I've got, um, well, I don't have a business coach right now, but what I do, I actually do have a business coach. So I have a business coach, personal trainer, um, and, uh, you know, an accountant and, and, you know, obviously lots of other, other people that assist me. But I love vocal coach because number one, yes, you are communicating to, you know, it one on one or in front of groups, you know, when you're at the level you're at, you get invited to speak in front of your, your very sought after. So lots of people want to hear the Cindy Rainey story. And, you know, speaking in front of people is not the same as one on one and it can be quite, quite scary. And also, but I love that I love that you're willing to do it. You're willing to do the hard stuff. And it's, you know, speaking in public, uh, speaking on this podcast, it's not easy. I don't think it's easy. And I've done it for a long time. So maybe it sounds natural to me, but I don't believe that it's easy to keep some of these attention for 45 minutes. Um, and yet I have to do that every single episode or do my best. And so having a coach is critical, I think, and it's so easy to forget as a non, uh, a non high end producer that getting a coach now is just as important as Cindy. It's easy to say, well, Cindy's a huge producer. She can afford to, to have all of these coaches in her life. Well, maybe, um, but every athlete has a coach and every athlete, professional athlete has coaches their entire history before they ever made a dollar. So, the importance of coaching, I love that, that you're into that. What does your coach help you to do or coaches? Well, I, you know, I was just going to say, I remember the day that I said to my husband, Jason, like, Hey, this is probably going back five or six years. I said, I think I want to do coaching. And I felt like it was kind of hokey. I was like, I was like, almost embarrassed to be, like, Hey, I think I want to do this. And at that point, I think it was like $750 a month. And I know what I said, I know it's a huge investment, but I want to try it. And we've, we've grown so much from that day. And my coaches have grown. So you don't stay with the same coach. Like, you grow, you get the next level of coach and, you know, progress is from there. Um, but, you know, you don't need to be making a ton of money to start investing in your business. I mean, I think for, for people that want to grow their business, that is the number one place to start, you know, you should hire an assistant to help you do the things that you're not good at or that you don't like to do and spend time on like meeting people being out there, the things that you are really good at. Um, and, and you should just invest in yourself early on. Yeah, I'll tell you what I have an assistant doing. So a lot of us, again, are thinking, I can't afford an assistant. Well, I have an assistant who lives in another part of the world. She's been with me for, for years. She's a lot less expensive than perhaps somebody would charge me here in the United States. But, you know, I can afford what I can afford. And as a result, I, um, so just today, this is kind of funny. So I don't practice real estate myself. I recruit REALTORS. So it's kind of similar in a sense. I'm reaching out to people trying to see if they'd have interest in joining our firm. Well, one of the things I realized was, uh, and again, if anyone who's listening in our local market, I apologize for pulling the curtain back on this, but just to show you what it, what somebody can do is I have an entire list of people I'm trying to prospect or that I'd like to eventually become an agent at our firm. And they're at other firms right now. And so what we're doing is we're tracking all of their production. And whenever they do something cool or do something important, we call this a relative, something impressive. Uh, even if it's just impressive to us, we're, we're sending them an email or I'm calling. And so what my assistant does, it's just one hour a day. I only pay her for one hour a day of this. She finds 20 of these opportunities, like, hey, this person just listed as crazy new listing. We should congratulate them and say, hey, we're watching you like, this is really cool. Like, good luck. And all of these ways to let people know that we care about them and that we're paying attention. And she just loads up 20 emails. She couple sentences each. And then I go through at the end of the day, I review each one to make sure it sounds like my voice and I can make changes. And she's been with me for years. So she knows my voice. And it would be just work. I would be doing anyway. And I have to review it and approve it. And I send it out. And it really does come from me. She just starts it. And it's, it's like the best money I can possibly spend because I can't spend that time coming up with 20 different reasons to reach out to these agents because it's just too much time to go through. So I, I love that. Yeah. That's a great way to have her use her, you know, time. And it's great that you can do that. And by the way, if anyone out there who has a team and is looking to build a team, use the strategy I just mentioned because if you want to poach somebody from a different team or if you just want to add to your team, you know, look for those agents that you want and start following them and paying attention to what they do on the MLS and, and I'll swear. And I assure you that probably their own managing broker is calling them to congratulate them on all their sales. That's a great idea. It's true. It's a great idea. Yeah. Do you get a lot of phone calls from, from, you know, because you're your own thing. People probably just let Cindy do her own thing, leave her alone. Yeah. It's nice to get. It's nice to get. It's nice to have someone say, hey, I noticed you just put up that great listing on people love praise. They love to know that you're, you know, noticing them. I think that's really smart. I think I'm going to do that when we start our next recruiting effort. There you go. And check out Cindy's listings too. On Cindy Rainey dot com. It's just super impressive. I think I always like to demystify a lot of times, you know, and I do this in my own life too. I'm like, if I only had that one thing, I'd be happy. I'd be successful. I'd be at. And oftentimes that one thing seems like it's the solution to whatever problem. And it may be it is, but oftentimes it's not. And so I'm curious on everybody wants to do luxury, you know, it's highly competitive. Obviously the commissions are high. But there's downsides to it. And I don't only one says downsides, there's unappealing parts of working in the luxury market as well. Number one, highly competitive. Obviously, number two, you have to really know your stuff. Maybe more so than, you know, a client at a lower price point that isn't being fought over as much in the marketplace. And number three, just, you know, having to outperform the other agents in your marketplace. So tell us, you know, what to, so you talked about, you know, I need to really know my data, my stats. What else is really important about, you know, keeping a keeping a luxury client happy, making sure that throughout the process, that, you know, what are you doing along the way to ensure that by the end of the process, they're like, wow, Cindy was the best. Yeah. You know, I think the most important thing is to find out how your client wants to communicate with you. And by asking them what they want. So do you want, do you want me to communicate with you by text, email, phone call, how often do you want me to update you? Because some people might want to be updated weekly. Like, for instance, my listing at Sasko Hill, they're not, they're not living here now. They live in Florida. But I still need to give him updates regularly. So it's important that I know the cadence of which he wants updates from me so that he's happy. You know, and I think just making sure that you're really available when somebody wants to talk to you. I mean, there are so many agents, well, I shouldn't say that. I think there are people just in general, you know, that are not looking at email consistently or don't respond quickly. That's one of my biggest pet peeves. I think if you're in service and you're working with someone for someone, you've got to be available. Yeah, we should also mention too. We didn't mention this. But Cindy's coach is, she works with the Tom Ferry coaching company. So if anyone's wondering, who does the top people use? Cindy uses Tom Ferry's company and obviously very well-respected people probably know Tom Ferry and his father Mike Ferry. They are one of the top two of the top two coaching companies out there. I want to talk a little bit about consistency because look, you're a busy, busy mom, you're a wife, you are a REALTOR, you're a team lead, and you're a producer on top of all of that. How do you maintain consistency with all of the complexity of your life? I'm really lucky that I have a team and I think having the team and having a schedule that we try to keep to allows me to have flexibility in my life and allows me to continue. So I'm not by nature the most organized person. So I've got an assistant who sits right next to me in my office. She's not here right now, but she keeps me on task and helps me with my calendar, with emails and things like that. We've got a full team, we've got a team of nine, we've got a marketing director, we've got several agents, we've got a social media director, you know, and things that are really important to stay consistent with would be our monthly newsletter. It goes out monthly, no matter what it happens, and every month we put a lot of time into it. It's interesting. People love it. We really, like, brainstorm about what we're going to give people on the market. We give them market insights, and we don't just spit out the numbers. We really think about it. I mean, it's like we, Jason is actually, he's my husband, he's my business partner, and his role on the team other than being our visionary, he's our numbers guy, he knows everything inside and out, so we all work together to put that together. And something like video, for instance, if you're going to put yourself out there on social media, you have to be consistent because people will start to expect to see you, and they will enjoy getting the information you're giving them. So consistency in anything you're doing, you've got to be, you know, to be great, you've got to be consistent. Yeah, let's talk about social media. So, you know, a lot of times agents in the luxury space, or people who want to get into the luxury space might think, well, maybe luxury, maybe luxury does, means I don't have to do a lot of social media because maybe it's been seen as that's more of a relationship play, and, you know, I don't know whether there's credence to that or not, but you are doing a lot of social media. So, tell us about the kind of content that you like to consistently do on social media that really helps, you know, personify the brand and help get people interested in you. Yeah, I think so what we do is we post every day, once a day on our posts, and then, you know, on stories, it's a different approach, but so we have a theme, it's like market Mondays, we talk about the market, tips Tuesdays, so it could be something, you know, like right now, it would be something in our community, and we would go somewhere like somebody on my team would go talk about where they've been, or like if you're going to go apple picking with your kids, where you'd go, it's just things people want to know. So, we have a schedule throughout the week. More than happy to share the inside, you know, list with anybody. If you want a DM me, feel free, I can give you sort of our cadence. And then on the stories, we sort of just keep whatever we want to talk about sort of like the day in the life of what's happening. So, like this weekend, I played paddle, we put that out on stories, you know, just trying to think like whatever is current and whatever we're doing as a team. And, you know, we always put our listings out there in obviously with the highest, you know, video quality. And it's really important to continually put your listings out there. So, we just have a cadence for every listing that it gets posted a certain number of times. And, you know, everybody will see it. I mean, we have with our new listing, I mean, everyone's saying I've we've never seen this listing before until you took it over. And now we're going to sell it. It's a $12 million listing. It had been on before for five years and hadn't sold. And we've got more traffic now because we took our formula and our, you know, rolling out our social media program. We should also mention too, getting a $12 million listing in most cases is not just throwing it up on the MLS and waiting for the, the, the showings to come rolling in because well, you know, there's not many people that play in that space. And not a lot of buyers just going, I'm just waiting around for a $12 million property to jump on the market. So, Cindy has a really tough job as a listing agent for these high end properties because she has to go find the buyers, which means she's got to have great relationships with other real tools who represent buyers in that space. She's got to know where those other buyers hang out, you know, online or even in person. So, she's got to flood the market. So, tell us a little bit about when you have a property like that, that is so, you know, just, just so specific and really, you know, less than 1% of the population would even, you know, be able to have that property. You know, how do you go about sort of figuring out how do we get this thing sold? You know, I think the most important thing that we have is a vast network. And it starts with our network at GlobalBanker. Part of why we're here is they have a global luxury program. And that gives us amazing marketing. Plus, it also gives us global reach. And that's really important because, you know, we know we know where the buyers are coming from today for these properties. We've done the research. And we really hit those areas around the world by reaching out to those agents with our marketing to make sure that they know that this listing exists. So, this just to interject for a second. So, we're not talking about, hey, all of the wealthy people at the country club in your local market who may be able to afford that property and just don't know what's up for sale. We're talking about people that move into the area, maybe from New York City, maybe from Florida, maybe from the West Coast, maybe who have other properties elsewhere. This is, you are really having to think about exactly where your buyers come from. And they, like you said, could be global. Yeah, no, it's, it is. And we definitely reach out to our contacts and make a personal phone call. I mean, I'm friends with people literally around the globe and say, like, hey, this is a great house. If you've got someone who's looking for something of this style, you should definitely show it to them. And what's also interesting is, you know, real estate doesn't happen in a vacuum. I mean, it's like everything we do here is is really hyper local, but you also need to know what's happening globally, nationally, you've got to know what's happening in other parts of the country because buyers at this level, they own several different homes. They probably have something, you know, an Aspen Miami. I mean, they're, they're, their homeowners in many different places. So it really helps to stay current on everything that's happening. I love that. You know, I wanted to talk switch gears just a little bit because I don't think we could ever over communicate about the importance of hard work. And I know that it's such a simple thing to say, such a hard thing to do. It's like a push up. It's like a really good idea to do a push up. It's not a lot of fun to do a push up, but it's a really good idea to do squats, push ups, you know, the things that kind of are a little painful. But if we want a healthy body, we probably need to do those things or we need to do some of those things. And hard work is, you know, obviously being a successful real stage and there's, there's no short cut to hard work that I've found. And I asked once that one of the top individual producers, actually the team, top team here in Chicago, but the team lead. I said, why do you think you're at the very, very top? Like, what do you think you do differently? He's like, I swear to God, he goes, he said, DJ, I swear to you, I just work harder than everyone. He's like, that's literally it. He goes, I'm not smarter. I'm not better. He's like, maybe I'm better because I've been doing it longer, but he's like, it's all because of hard work. So I'm curious. Let's, I'd love to hear your thoughts about hard work. Yeah. I mean, it is, it is hard. This job is hard. I mean, the people that say, oh, I'm going to get into real estate because the schedule is flexible and it's an easy thing to do. It is hard. It is, it's like, it's a 24 seven job. And until you get to the point where you can surround yourself with a team, you're working all the time, all the time. So, you know, in the beginning, you know, all you have to sit open houses like do two on Saturday, two on Sunday, you know, take desk duty every time you can get it, you know, constantly market and put yourself out there. Do mailings, all of these things until you, you know, have a name for yourself. But I mean, I work hard every day all day now, even though we have the team, but it's a little bit easier because it's a little more organized. I, you know, I just took my mom and my two girls to Paris a week and a half ago. And it nobody skipped to be. It was fine. We put two listings on and it was great because I have this super strong team behind me. I was always available, but it can run without me here in the moment, which is amazing. Yeah. Well, gosh, that's impressive. I suspect being a mom of five and team lead and and producer as well, that you, you would have to know when you wake up every day. I know I have a plan for the day. And can we talk about how do you set that plan? Because what you, what you're accomplishing to you, maybe it's like, well, this is just what I do. To everybody else, they see you as like an alien. Like, how are you able to do all of this? So I'm curious just with the planning of the day. How do you think about planning the day? Because there's so much chaos in your life, you have to have a plan. Yes. So I mean, a couple of things. I, I learned a few years ago that I used to say all the time, like, I'm, I'm busy, I'm busy, I'm busy. And that was sort of like, like, my go to phrase. And I was really good at multitasking. But now, you know, I turned 50 recently. I can't multitask as well. So I have to stay super organized. So my day is pretty much the same every day. I wake up, I make my latte downstairs. It's like, first thing I have to have every morning. I spend about a half hour really getting ready for my day, checking emails, making sure I'm ready for any listing appointments, anything I have. And my 13 year old daughter goes to school about a half hour away from us. I could put her on a bus, but like, she's my last child at home. And I love that time with her. So I drive her to school. We listen to Taylor Swift. We talk. We like get ready for the day. And then I, then from, at once I drop her, I come right to the office and we have our team meeting, our team huddle. And then I work really from, you know, nine to about three. And then the rest of the day from three on, I'm back on like family time, fully available. But I'm back to, you know, picking up CC from practice, bringing her something somewhere to a tutor. And then I'll get back on the computer maybe around seven. Yeah. And then our, how much sleep do you get? Because you, sleep has got to be a luxury for you. No, I can tell you exactly how much because I've been wearing my Apple watch literally every day since I got back from Paris. I'm a little obsessed with my amount of sleep right now. I've been getting like eight and a half hours of sleep. And I'm, I now need to like do a deeper dive because there's like core sleep, deep sleep, REM sleep. And I need to figure out what it all means. But I'm like last night, it got seven and a half hours, but I still feel okay. But my average is like eight and a half hours of sleep, which I think is pretty good. That's more than a little bit good. That is, that is crazy. But again, it requires for you to even to get eight and a half hours of sleep or seven and a half hours. It requires a ton of organization. It requires a discipline of, I need to go to bed at this time. I need to wake up at this time. Obviously, as a mom, you have to wake up and you have responsibilities for the family. And, but I love to that at three o'clock every day, there's a time from three to seven. It's mom time. It's family time. I'm here. I'm present. And then I can, you know, do my work in the evening. Should I, should I have any? And then I get to go to bed at a, wow, you have, you maybe have the most balanced life I've ever heard of from a producer of your level. It hasn't been this way always. And I'm really lucky because I work with my husband. And like, we have different offices. So we're not in the same place. We do different things. We stay in our lane. I learned what that meant early on when we started working together. But I, it has not always been this way. I missed countless soccer games. I mean, when I was in my 30s, late 30s, like there were, I didn't even see my kids on the weekends. You know, so I mean, it, I put the time in. And I think it was important for my kids to see that I did that. And they are really respect hard work. I've got a child who he's turning 21. He's going to graduate in three years from Babs and College. And he's trying, he's going to grad school. I mean, he is so, he's such a hard worker. Like they're all such hard workers. I'm so proud of all of them. Yeah, it's just, it's, it's right now being a mom, it is my mom and being a part of the family. That's like my why. That's why I do everything that I do. So I make sure that that I make that a priority as well as obviously taking care of my clients. And then thirdly giving back to our community because we can. And it's really important to me. Yeah, let's talk about giving back. So why is giving back important and what does that mean to you? You know, I think that by giving back to other people, I mean, it's, it, it makes you feel good. First of all, that when you can help other people, and there are so many people, we're in a community that's right next to a town that people are, they do not have everything that they need. And the fact that we can help people in so many different ways, it means the world. I mean, there's so many different ways you can help today. But I have a child who had struggled with anxiety and depression for a little bit. And I know that there are people that don't have resources. So part of what we're doing, we work with Bridgeport Hospital. We have just been able to give a tremendous amount of money throughout committee that I'm on. The reward that I'm on to help handle situations when kids come in, those teenagers who are just anxious or depressed so that they're not put with the adults. I mean, there's, there's so many different causes out there. But that is something that's like near and dear to me. And I just want to be able to help as much as I can. Yeah, I think about right now, teen girls in particular with social media, it's got to be brutal. I can't imagine seeing perfection and images, it's seeing things that they're not, it's real, but it looks real. And it looks like, oh, I don't look like that or I don't have that life or I don't have that thing or I don't have that friend group or I didn't get to go to that party and look at all the pictures. And that would have leveled me as a kid. I know we're getting off track. But so it's so true. I know it's so true. I'm so glad that I did not have that growing. Oh, me too. Oh my god. It would be horrible. It would have ruined me to know on Monday that I didn't get invited to a party. I would know I would hear about it on Monday. Oh, I didn't get invited. But it wasn't in your face. It wasn't it wasn't my feet. Yeah, I didn't see the pictures of every so. So yeah, let's have let's have a lot of compassion and empathy for those teens, you know, boys and girls that are dealing with. I hope in the next few generations, there'll be a rejection of some of that stuff. Maybe we can use social media more effectively. Yeah. But anyway, I also want to talk a little bit about where you struggle because every successful person, nobody's perfect. Everyone's got problems. I have problems. You have problems. And certainly not looking to do a deep dive into all of your problems. But just so that people know you're human, what is what is one part of your business that isn't as perfect as you would like it to be? Gosh, I think that something that we have struggled with and what we're working toward is real processes for things. And so every time I feel like we have a process for something, we all we have to always like continue to come back to it because, you know, we have a team and if we're not on top of everything exactly the way it needs to be, you know, so we need to know like who's ordering the sign, who's putting the listing in, who's doing this. And it's an evolution of making sure everybody's working the way they need to. And I think the other struggle is sometimes if I'm the final word on something, I can be the person holding up a project. Sure. And I realize that and I need to make sure that I'm giving enough of my time to projects that might be really important to my marketing manager. I mean, they're, you know, working really hard and I don't want to be the person holding them up. Yeah, I love that. Just more organization. It sounds like it more, it's constant, constant refinement, right? And balance is imposs- balance is impossible. So it's more about getting as close to balance as you can. There's no work like balance. There's no work like balance. There's no I mean, you just you're in it and you just do the best you can. One last question. Let's say, and I know you are constantly, you know, you have a big team, you constantly have clients, clients are probably always are dealing with clients. But let's just say you had a time where you didn't have any listings or buyers in a particular day. What might you do that day? Would it be any different from any other day or what would you do? Because there's lots of people out there right now that maybe aren't don't have clients. And I'm just curious, would that change your day at all? Or would it be just don't put my head down and keep doing the same stuff? If I, I mean, look, I'm a warrior by nature. So if I don't have a lot in the pipeline, I am always working toward keeping the pipeline going. So I would say if you didn't have something today, you know, you just literally go back to your database. More clients come from your existing database. I wouldn't go out and try to find new people. I would go back to your database. There's some crazy statistic that's something like 80% of the people that bought during COVID are not happy in their home. Like start there. So start calling people that bought a house during COVID and tell them like, look, you know, a lot of people rushed into a purchase. You're not crazy if you don't love your house. They may be they overpaid. Yeah, maybe I keep there's, but that's a great place to start. Also, I would, I always just go to my phone and I start calling A to Z. So I know where I've left off and you just pick up the phone and you actually make a phone call, not a text, not an email, say, hi, how are you? Talk to them about something, you know, right now, interest rates, I mean, they're they're up a little bit more than they were a couple weeks ago, but we called all of our clients the bought a house. Finally, it's a reasonable. Yeah. They were and they, some of these people saved anywhere from like, you know, 20 to $40,000 a year just by refinancing in that quick moment that they could. So, you know, I weren't open book. Like if anybody ever wants to get ideas from us, please DM me through Instagram and we will get back to you with, you know, video ideas. We've got our social media ideas, some of our processes like the one thing I will say is that I've surrounded myself with amazing people and I've mastered my groups. I didn't invent all of this. I learned a lot from so many other people and I'm happy to, you know, spread what I've learned from other people and share it. So, well, city, what, what a great place to, to wrap up, Cindy Rainey.com is where you can learn about all things. Cindy, again, please check out her website. Notice how clean and crisp and pretty it is aesthetically. Look at the aesthetics of it. And luxury presence is amazing. They're great. And luxury presence is the web builder for that. They are great. And also, I want you to follow Cindy on Instagram because she is super consistent with her social media and it's been a, been very successful for her. So, it's Cindy Rainey and it's R-A-N-E-Y and A-N-D team. Cindy Rainey and team on Instagram will have a link in the show notes. And Cindy, one last question for you. If you were a brand new agent starting today, still knowing everything you know, well, or let's just say a different way, you, you, you had to move to another state in a place where you didn't know anybody and you had to start over. What would you do day one if we plucked you out and threw you in the middle of Iowa, for example? Okay, I would, first of all, learn everything I could about the market. I would just study, study, study the market. I would go out, I would see all of the inventory. So, become the expert day one. Take hours and just drive around, learn everything you can. And I would probably join a team of some sort day one to align myself with other experts. And I think by doing that, I think you can very quickly start getting listings. And from there, it all trickles down. And listings are really the key to driving business. And today's market. So it's possible. And making sure you're on social media as the expert. And I'm going to add a tack on because I know Cindy would, would say this open houses, too, who's especially if you have a tea, if you join a team, bag, borrow or steal, get those open houses, even if it's not your listing, bag them, please, please, please, let me do open houses. But the, the expert at the open house, we're treating every single thing about that house. Somebody can't say like, oh, does it have this kind of heating? You have to like know exactly, and know, know what like it's your own home. I love that. Know what like it's your own home. Know the story of the home, too. Is there a story that goes on? Yeah. That, I mean, that's how we sell. I think so many homes. There's an emotional piece to every listing and you're telling the story of the house and why it's so great. You're making an emotional connection with the house, with the buyer, and that's really been such a key for us. Well, Cindy, thank you so much.
