[00:02:46] Okay, today on the show, our guest is Jen McConnell from Maccaddle Real Estate Partners
[00:02:51] in Charleston, South Carolina.
[00:02:54] Let me tell you more about Jen.
[00:02:55] Now Jen was fortunate enough to start her real estate career when she was just a junior
[00:03:00] in college.
[00:03:01] Now with over 17 years of experience in the industry, she has a particular expertise in luxury

[00:03:14] marketing where she has been awarded the prestigious million dollar guild award.
[00:03:18] Jen has also earned the coveted REALTOR of Distinction Award, achieving the highest
[00:03:22] rank possible as a platinum award winner through the Charleston Trident Association of REALTORS.
[00:03:28] The platinum award Jen places in the top 2% of agents in Charleston.
[00:03:34] And in 2021, Jen and her husband Josh opened their own brokerage on the Isle of Palms in
[00:03:40] Charleston, South Carolina and for McConnell real estate partners where she is the broker
[00:03:46] in charge.
[00:03:46] Also, they run a foundation, which we're going to be speaking about as well to learn about
[00:03:52] everything Jen and McConnell real estate partners visit their website, CHS estates estates
[00:04:00] is plural CHS estates.com.

[00:04:05] You can just go to our show notes, click on CHS estates.com and check out everything Jen
[00:04:10] and Josh.
[00:04:12] Jen, welcome to the show.
[00:04:14] Thank you.
[00:04:14] Thank you for having me.
[00:04:16] You've got it.
[00:04:16] I am so excited because Charleston is just one of those places that I just feel like
[00:04:23] everybody who visits it, you know, that I know seems to come back saying, oh, I wish I
[00:04:28] were to live there and you were telling me off camera that you're getting like 60 plus
[00:04:33] people a day move to the Charleston area, which is just incredible.
[00:04:37] From elsewhere, but not only that, but there are so many people that come here to vacation
[00:04:41] and then literally they just say they're like some little pack up my stuff.
[00:04:44] I'm just going to hang here until it's here.
[00:04:46] No, they really just haven't say something during COVID.
[00:04:49] Oh my gosh, the whole seat in New York just basically came here and they're like, oh,
[00:04:52] we're just not going to go home.
[00:04:52] We're just going to stay here now.
[00:04:53] We're going to move here and buy up.
[00:04:55] Which is obviously great for real estate agents.
[00:04:59] However, I imagine there's a lot more real estate agents probably getting their license these
[00:05:03] days.
[00:05:03] I assume it's probably I bet the real estate, the REALTOR populations, I don't know if
[00:05:09] it's doubled, but there's got to be more REALTORS now.
[00:05:12] So it's good.
[00:05:13] It's good.
[00:05:13] And it's also there's a lot of competition.
[00:05:15] I'm guessing.
[00:05:16] Yeah.
[00:05:16] I mean, we have close to 7,000 licensed agents.
[00:05:19] But you know, the top like 500 makeup 98 percent.
[00:05:22] They do it.
[00:05:23] Yeah.
[00:05:23] Yeah.
[00:05:23] Yeah.
[00:05:24] It's funny.
[00:05:25] We do that in Chicago here.
[00:05:26] We have about 47,000 agents total and same sort of thing.
[00:05:31] It's like the top 20% do most of the because there's so many people that get their license
[00:05:36] as a part time thing or they just do it to buy and sell their own properties.
[00:05:40] But what's really cool about Charleston is you have you have like a lot of advantages,
[00:05:44] right?
[00:05:44] You have this beautiful, wonderful city, wonderful weather.
[00:05:48] You're you're you have beaches.
[00:05:50] You also have vacation rentals like there's so Charleston just had in the rich history,
[00:05:55] but just so much going for it.
[00:05:56] It's just oh, I'm so jealous.
[00:05:59] There's so much no matter what your life's salad, it's here in Charleston.
[00:06:02] I guarantee you know, my wife is the arts.
[00:06:04] If it you know, golf feed, I mean tennis is huge.
[00:06:07] I mean, everything voting like everything that you're finishing and you want to do is
[00:06:11] here for sure.
[00:06:12] Oh, I'm so jealous and I'm a tennis and not not as much of a golfer, but my dad's a golfer
[00:06:17] and you know, he's been in golfing all over the Carolinas for the last 30 years, like
[00:06:23] three, four times a year.
[00:06:24] So we we were lucky enough to go to Kewa Island.
[00:06:28] Actually, not together.
[00:06:29] I take it back.
[00:06:29] We didn't go together.
[00:06:30] We went different trips.
[00:06:32] I was thinking we did a father-son thing, but we didn't.
[00:06:34] But anyway, that's also right near you as well.
[00:06:37] That's amazing.
[00:06:38] Yeah, one of the most impressive courses on these coasts.
[00:06:41] The ocean course.
[00:06:42] Oh, yeah.
[00:06:44] You know, it's funny.
[00:06:44] I've not that our audience doesn't care about my golfing, but I will say if you if you're
[00:06:49] a golfer, you need to have an experience once in your life where you have a caddy.
[00:06:54] And the first time I ever had an actual caddy like walk with me through the course, which
[00:06:58] is very strange experience, was was at the ocean course in Kewa.
[00:07:02] And I was like, thank God, because I was like, what do I do here?
[00:07:05] It's like literally one of the hardest courses in the world.
[00:07:08] And I'm not okay enough about that.
[00:07:10] Nobody's paid.
[00:07:11] Nobody's logged out to hear my golf stories.
[00:07:13] We're talking about you.
[00:07:16] So how did you you started?
[00:07:18] You got into real estate when you were in college, which is not very common for the guests
[00:07:23] that I have on the show.
[00:07:24] So how did that happen and why?
[00:07:28] Sure.
[00:07:28] So when I was a year in college, I was a marketing and finance major and I had an internship.
[00:07:34] And I don't know.
[00:07:35] I just always knew that I was going to real estate somehow.
[00:07:37] And I don't know what kind of led me in the new construction realm.
[00:07:41] But I knew that there was a home builder on Highway 30 in Ashland, Ohio, which isn't
[00:07:45] where I went to college and where I grew up.
[00:07:47] And I just knew that that sounded like a really cool job.
[00:07:50] And I could do that as an internship.
[00:07:51] Or maybe they would pay me, maybe they wouldn't.
[00:07:53] So I just literally like walked in, I had my resume, I'm like 20 years old.
[00:07:58] And they were like, well, oh, we were hiring, but we're actually, we just hired this.
[00:08:03] So the spot, and I was like, well, that's just not going to work.
[00:08:05] I didn't seem to talk to your manager.
[00:08:07] Like that's all.
[00:08:07] Like I promise I'm not here.
[00:08:09] I just want to like a job, do your internship, and we find, like I just talked with them,
[00:08:12] and they eventually like edged my way in and let me talk to the manager.
[00:08:15] And then I'm getting it for like a sales assistant position.
[00:08:17] I was like, OK, well, this is cool.
[00:08:19] And then I was just, I loved it.
[00:08:21] I loved it.
[00:08:22] So it was custom construction at like 20 years old, you're designing these ridiculous houses.
[00:08:27] In Ohio, they were like, you know what you kind of see everywhere, like on a farm or
[00:08:31] you know, some nice houses for sure.
[00:08:33] But then they opened right when I was graduating.
[00:08:36] So a year later, and they were like, you want to go to Charleston and you're going to
[00:08:40] Wilmington?
[00:08:40] I was like, well, you know, never been to Charleston.
[00:08:42] Let's do that.
[00:08:43] Like I've heard it's great.
[00:08:44] Let's go there.
[00:08:45] Yeah.
[00:08:45] So I moved down to New York to know a person at all.
[00:08:48] I opened up their first stuff down to location in Charleston.
[00:08:50] Wow.
[00:08:51] And been down forever since.
[00:08:52] And you know, that, and I was 21 at that time designing like ridiculous beach houses,
[00:08:57] multi-million dollar beach houses.
[00:08:58] Like who gets that opportunity, right?
[00:09:01] Like it was just, it was wild.
[00:09:02] So that's really how I got my start in new construction.
[00:09:04] And then you construction for 11 years.
[00:09:07] And then once I got married, I started to have kids.
[00:09:09] And I was like, I don't really want to work six days a week.
[00:09:12] Like, I want to kind of have more flexibility with my schedule.
[00:09:15] So then I got my journal bookage license in 2008.
[00:09:18] And then actually didn't really start doing it full time until like 2016.
[00:09:22] Wow.
[00:09:23] Because you were busy doing mom stuff.
[00:09:25] And you were really like, I actually, so I had my kid and I had my daughter when I was
[00:09:29] still working in new construction.
[00:09:30] But literally like on maternity leave, I was like, I can't go back to six days a week.
[00:09:35] And we're going, you know, we're just going to general brokerage at that point.
[00:09:38] So that's when we kind of came back to Charleston, got on ILEPOM.
[00:09:42] And yeah, it's been a journal bookage in sense.
[00:09:44] So 2016, when I've been in general bookage.
[00:09:47] Wow.
[00:09:47] Well, you know, as somebody who I don't run our brokerage, but I know the work it takes
[00:09:56] as being part of the management staff at our brokerage.
[00:09:58] And you know, I almost wonder, are you working even more now that you run your own brokerage?
[00:10:03] Are you able to have better balance because you have, you know, some of that flexibility?
[00:10:08] You know, the work I balanced is an interesting topic.
[00:10:10] And then I've been several masterminds about that.
[00:10:13] But I do feel very close to that balance.
[00:10:16] So I found that if you're really stressed and running on fumes, there's either two things.
[00:10:21] One of two things were both missing either leverage or system.
[00:10:24] And I was missing both.
[00:10:26] Like in 2016 to like 2019, it was really just running on fumes.
[00:10:31] You know, I was doing I was the EA, I was the assistant, I was doing all the transaction paperwork.
[00:10:35] I was going over your clothes and whatever, I'm the section.
[00:10:37] I was selling, I was going listing.
[00:10:39] It's impossible, right?
[00:10:41] Like you can't keep up with that stuff.
[00:10:42] And by the way, you're a mom too.
[00:10:44] And I have like a one and a year old.
[00:10:46] So it's like, you know, it's not an ad or marriage.
[00:10:49] Like it's not sustainable.
[00:10:50] So I found that really quickly and we had a major life change in 2018.
[00:10:56] They kind of shook our world and that's when everything's going to be respected.
[00:10:59] To be honest with you that it was like, look, like it's just not going to operate that way.
[00:11:03] Like we deserve a better life than that and things just need to change because we just
[00:11:06] save our every moment we came with our children, ourselves, our marriage, you know, everything.
[00:11:10] So just kind of worked itself out that way.
[00:11:12] And now I'm just very focused on if we have a pain somewhere in our business,
[00:11:16] it's a system or a person that we're missing.
[00:11:19] And that's really what it comes on to.
[00:11:20] I think Wow, that's such a, it's a really concise and I was trying to sort of poke holes in it as I was thinking,
[00:11:26] is it always systems are people and okay, maybe it's not always that, but like probably 95% of the time.
[00:11:32] It was that.
[00:11:33] So I was thinking like it's true enough, you know, and I was just reflecting in my own business.
[00:11:39] Cause you know, whatever my own struggles and I was thinking, she's right.
[00:11:43] It's systems and people.
[00:11:44] So I think that is such a great point.
[00:11:46] And I always like to remind our audience too.
[00:11:49] If you hear this, you go, well, easy for them, their top producers and they have unlimited resources to be able to hire people.
[00:11:57] And it's like, well, maybe or maybe not, but the good news is for anyone listening who maybe is a solo practitioner,
[00:12:02] maybe is newer to the business and doesn't have those resources.
[00:12:06] You can hire help from all over the world these days, you know, using like upwork.com is a great place to look.
[00:12:13] And the point is, is you don't, if you, you know, if you can't afford someone local and you can have tasks that can be done, you know, virtually.
[00:12:21] Thank God there's so many options now and people can afford to have, you know, more of that virtual assistant experience at a really nice price point.
[00:12:30] Well, yeah, and I mean, I would honestly say like even three years ago, I was on a top producer.
[00:12:34] Like I was doing well at compared to everyone else in my office.
[00:12:37] I was at a big brokerage, but nothing compared to what I'm doing now.
[00:12:41] And it's just because I think it's more focused on those systems first.
[00:12:45] And then I hired the people that can help with help showing, help doing the EA work, help a personal assistant role, and really just allowing me to do what I'm good at,
[00:12:53] which is being in front of my clients, where helping them get deals, you know, listening home, I mean, that's what I'm good at as a part of people, not sitting here filling out my dot root.
[00:13:01] Talks, right? Like there's people that can do that other way better than I am at that type of work.
[00:13:06] And I phrase them for it because they just they know how to do it way better and I could never touch it. So why try.
[00:13:13] I couldn't agree with you more and it's I know it's hard to for a lot of our listeners and even for me as well.
[00:13:19] I'm not a practicing agent, but I work amongst agents and just this idea of giving over part of your business to, you know, to someone else to be able to handle.
[00:13:27] And it's like, what if they screw it up? What if they make mistakes? And and I understand the fear there.
[00:13:32] But was that challenging for you to be able to give up because again, you know, I can't do everything, but I'm used to doing everything.
[00:13:39] And if I give up my dot loop docs to someone else, what if, you know, it was at a fear of yours that like things would just all fall apart.
[00:13:48] Oh, 100% and it was so silly. Like I look back and I'm like, oh, I like really work skinned and bold like for years. Like what was I think is like, no, some little mess up a document.
[00:13:58] And then like I just it's better to do it myself. No, it's not 100% it's not. There is someone who is better with each skill set and you have to figure out what your top 20% should be and that's what you should focus on 100%.
[00:14:10] The other 80% that you're doing that you're not really that good at you to leverage that out for sure because they're going to have to be there. 1% and even with documents like transaction management companies are plentiful. They are all over.
[00:14:23] They charge I don't know three 400 bucks a deal and you only pay if the deal closes and then that person, you know, you have to find a good person, of course, but like you just, you know, there's a million ways to find good good, you know, people to help with that.
[00:14:34] It's like for 400 bucks to never have to deal with paperwork again per deal. It seems like a pretty good deal to me.
[00:14:41] Yeah, I mean, again, like I think that just saying in your language, I mean, husband, wife, you know, we own our breakfast together. So saying our language is very important.
[00:14:49] But saying in your lane with what you're good at and knowing what you're good at is like the first thing you should find out if you're just becoming a real estate agent.
[00:14:57] Like know what you're really good at. Sometimes those agents are better at the paperwork and maybe they need to be like an EA role and just a showing assistant.
[00:15:04] So they get the interaction with people, but they can still do their work, which really they love to check those boxes, whereas like I don't want to see the box. I just want to talk and I just want to go and I want to go to the houses and
[00:15:12] let's them into these marketing videos and do the fun stuff, you know, so I think just always finding your role and saying you're saying in your lane is super important and knowing what your role is coming as a new agent for sure.
[00:15:23] But yeah, I'm definitely do everything starting out 100% need to do that until you're too tired and and more now and hopefully you don't get to the as far as I got where I was like every day was working on like no breaks. You know, that's just not fun.
[00:15:34] You this we're here to live right and give back and that's what we I realized to kind of.
[00:15:40] In just few years ago, but like I said like three years ago, you know, my I did like eight million like that's not really a lot in our market at all. You know, and so I think implementing those things, implementing leverage, implementing.
[00:15:55] People and implementing systems like that's why we are where you know, we are today. So for sure.
[00:16:01] Yeah, I agree and I think it's a good place to talk about your sort of your true north and and what like because you and your husband have created a foundation and I want to you know, whatever you're willing to share about that I'd love to share that with our audience because I think you know, for somebody to find their why or true north is so critical especially right now when the real estate market is changed and people are REALTOR is a lot of them are struggling with that.
[00:16:40] And so that's really important to you.
[00:16:48] So back in 2018 of my son was 2017 actually who's born in July and it was five months old who is diagnosed with cancer here at MUSC Children Software One downtown Charleston.
[00:17:00] So that obviously was very earth shattering for us, but that day that he was diagnosed my I stopped I did not talk to clients. My phone was off emails were cut off social media was cut off.
[00:17:13] I didn't have to focus on getting him cured. So you know, that's scary for real estate especially I was I was just getting into general brokerage. I had just gone back in general brokerage 2017.
[00:17:23] So I was just getting back into it, you know, kind of getting a groove going and then you know that hits and you stop.
[00:17:29] So we didn't care about that at all. You know, I feel like everything will work out on the end. So he was cured fortunately by this five months or excuse me, 10 months birthday.
[00:17:39] I guess if you want to call it so by 10 months old he was cured of cancer, which was of course it's like the best you know, the best thing you could ever hear in your life.
[00:17:47] Like in the fact that I could say cured we were like wait, wait, did you say the scene words like you're like versus remission right?
[00:17:54] Right, right, right, like that's what we were expecting. She's like, no, you know, you're he's cured and you know that for us was just it's everything right.
[00:18:01] So that really propelled our business entirely and changed everything. So my husband left corporate America within six months of my son's cure simply because we just realized like the grind and being responsible to a corporation
[00:18:16] who kind of really doesn't care if you're here or not or what's going on in your life. They want you to be there and represent that really changed everything.
[00:18:23] So he came on board six months later left corporate America.
[00:18:27] Once our son would be able to go back to school. So there's kind of a lag once you're cured and when you can go back.
[00:18:31] I only worked you know six months that year and in that six months, I did $8 million.
[00:18:36] So that was my top year, you know, today as of then that was my.
[00:18:40] It's an amazing six months really.
[00:18:43] With all of the stress of what's going on. Yes.
[00:18:46] Well, my son did not ring and that was kind of something in the middle that you're thinking like, well dang like I thought I would have had like a call and no, my phone was dead.
[00:18:54] And I'm like, wow, you know, okay, we'll have to start over like it's all right. I can do that. I can start over again. It's fine.
[00:19:00] Like whatever I got to do to skip this boy here and a week before my son went back to school, my son's going to bring it again like it was just referrals coming in.
[00:19:09] Eight is from other markets sending referrals repeat clients coming back like it was a miracle. I mean, he's a miracle for sure, but like it was just that to me.
[00:19:17] I'm really just that's God that's that's enough and do it.
[00:19:20] So that that best year was definitely him.
[00:19:23] And then from there, we just kept doubling our business and it really comes down to at that point, where we realized like I'm not going to grind 24 seven not see my family, not see my kids, not see my husband.
[00:19:35] And then just you weren't out like who wants to go through life like that. So I were very intentional on where we spend our time.
[00:19:41] But then implementing those those systems and and the people that we really need to be able to run and run at a high rate.
[00:19:47] So you know, this year will do 45 million.
[00:19:50] And that was just three years ago where I did eight, you know, so yeah, it's amazing. And and this idea of it's almost like saving up for a rainy day in a sense because this idea that you guys had your
[00:20:01] your obviously your your child was struggling with a very serious illness and and and that takes every all of your attention.
[00:20:10] And of course the business does have to go on on pause. And then when you say when you come back, it's like, oh boy, my clients, you know, they've sort of disappeared for a while.
[00:20:18] And maybe they won't return. Maybe I do have to start over and this idea of building systems so that when, you know, really unfortunate things like that happen.
[00:20:27] And you know, there's there's ways to keep the business to some degree, chugging along.
[00:20:32] And so I imagine that's probably was motivation for you to that should should we need you know, should we want to spend more time, you know, at home or or with the kids or whatever the goals of the family are, you now have systems in place to support that.
[00:20:46] Right. Well, I mean, I literally used to have my client like my database was like self spreadsheet like I mean that was just three years ago.
[00:20:56] So it's like, you know, you have to find somewhere like to say that very humble beginning, but you know, yeah, it's just it's not sustainable again. So like why I was running the grind because like I had to make sure I hit all these people right how many times a day and how many different weeks and two weeks out through that on a self spreadsheet. It's not sustainable.
[00:21:11] So I'm sure most agents have something much more sophisticated now. Thankfully, but really what changed our business beyond just that is is having that northern star like we were talking about earlier and and that for us is to be able to give back to Bowdiez on call just my son's name is Bowdie.
[00:21:26] His oncologist is Dr. Jacqueline Krabakad and USC and she has one of the only pediatric research labs in South Carolina for cancer. So, you know, we just and I both had prayed to guys when we were in the hospital once we found out he was diagnosed and we were.
[00:21:40] We just said like it's he gets through this like we will do whatever we can. Sorry.
[00:21:45] No. It's okay.
[00:21:48] These are these are big things.
[00:21:50] So I appreciate I appreciate the biggest things honestly. Yeah. So I appreciate your appreciate your emotion.
[00:21:58] Yeah. And we just so we would do whatever we could to give back.
[00:22:02] And so you started a foundation and I the foundation is tell us about actually tell us about the foundation.
[00:22:10] Well, yeah. So the first thing that we did actually say 2018 he was cured 2019.
[00:22:15] What we decided to do with our brokerage was we started setting aside a portion of every commission and donating that to pediatric cancer research in 2019.
[00:22:23] We did 20 or yeah, 25,000 dollars and then 50,000 dollars the next year this year we're already over 65,000. So I think we'll be close to like 90,000 will donate just for the brokerage.
[00:22:35] So it which is awesome right and we involve our clients like this is a very transactional business.
[00:22:41] But on the buyer and seller side like it's a very relational relationship based business.
[00:22:46] And so what really came super clear to us once we knew that we wanted to kind of base our business around giving back to to doctor for back his research.
[00:22:55] So we need to really involve them into what we're doing. And so you know every email we update them on where we are with our MUSC goal for the year.
[00:23:02] We invite them to our fundraising events and if we have client events will have like a donate portion and you know it's not often because our clients just they come through for us and they're always so sweet like before we had our foundation they would literally just like hand us checks and we'd like we're here like I want to I want to go next year for a cause I'm like well I know but I can't take your.
[00:23:19] You're like donations from a brokerage so it's like you know how to look for the way that like I but I knew we could do so much more to right so.
[00:23:25] So what always do you know from our brokerage to decide that portion that will always give back to doctor back his research and the often things is for research to share on national level by the way like she shared with St. Jude and all these wonderful amazing hospital across the country so that's the cool thing is not just here that her research is going.
[00:23:43] But then so basically once clients kept paying that money and we're like guys but you can't do it that way.
[00:23:48] We were like you know what we can do it bigger we got a bit bigger and we just need to start our own foundation so in 2021 we started our own foundation the McConnell foundation and we had our very first gala last year in June and we raised $45,000 for our first gala for Dr. tobacco which was like really cool I know like I don't have a gauge because like I've never done that before but I mean I have great mentors in the industry and they were like to like that's really really impressive I'm like okay good I hope it's like I want to double it next year.
[00:24:17] I'm like I know like I love it so it's cool it's cool that we've done almost $120,000 in the last two years to emissive pediatric cancer research so it's you know we just want to make it a better.
[00:24:28] We just yeah I mean and again like that's why like I feel like I think given the skills in what I do real estate that is helping me give this life to someone else hopefully you know and and provide that research so that's really art that's our northern star like we were talking about earlier and that's why we
[00:24:46] do what we do when we are so clear focus on you know what we need to be able to provide for the research for sure.
[00:24:54] I mean that's such an interesting and an important thing that you said and I want to make sure that our audience really heard that because I suspect that when you when you and your husband and look at your brokerage and come up with sort of ideas of what you want to do for 2023 and beyond.
[00:25:10] I imagine you know a big part of the conversation is hey we want to raise X amount of money for or we want to donate and raise for you know this pediatric you know cancer research and that becomes a huge motivator to keep the business growing and operating versus just you know and there's nothing wrong with of course you know one's own salary and one's own own commissions but it is I imagine because of how much it impacted your family.
[00:25:38] That becomes a huge motivator so it's so interesting you said we just want to be able to donate more so in order to do that we have to do more business and and raise more money and I think that is such a such a really a beautiful thing and and really applaud you for for finding that north star and and then taking action right and realizing that so many people you know you know don't don't take that kind of action and not to judge them in a different way but it's not a good thing.
[00:26:07] But it's really something that's super admirable and and you get your entire community behind you as well and everyone now is is wanting you know wanting you to succeed so so I applaud you for that for sure.
[00:26:19] I want to pause for a moment to talk about our episode sponsor are one of my favorite companies out there follow up boss now after interviewing hundreds of top REALTORS in the country for the spot cast you know which CRM is used by more than any other by our guests of course it is follow up boss and let's face it following up.

[00:27:37] And now back to our episode let's talk a little bit more about systems and you know because you know you were talking about and I've interviewed people on our show that that still work out of an Excel spreadsheet and that works for them and great but there are more sophisticated options and so I'm just curious on like how you went from Excel spreadsheet to more automation right I obviously yeah let's just tell me sort of what that journey was like for you.
[00:28:09] So the top priority of course we involved with clients is to ride the top tier level experience like we by kind of coin ourselves as a concierge level real estate and so we want to I think my earbuds are dying so sorry if you let me know if you can't hear me for some reason.
[00:28:26] No you're you sound great.
[00:28:28] So to provide that concierge level real estate not only just according to being in front of them but everything else so before they meet us you know what are they seen on our website or what they see in our social media so it comes down like for me on the marketing kind of behind our our brand and so I look more at our how we're presenting ourselves we have a client moving truck which is a 16 foot you know fully branded moving truck which our clients can use complimentary when they're moving or even if they just buy something you know and do so.
[00:28:56] So I think I'm going to go pick it up so just taking kind of the experience to the next level you know when we started in general brokerage in 2018 probably 75% of our business was bought leads whereas now I'm at 5% which really I'm not buying those are just major corporations that I pay referral fee to to help their exact so I do consider that thought but so we're at a 95% referral for you know we're key clients.
[00:29:26] And based now so what we've done but we're but our margins have not changed so what we did we took that money that you were using when you were buying your clients and I put it into the customer experience and that client experience from you know not just once they meet us all the way through years and years down the road so that's your kind of events but just elevating them and elevating everything that we do like we're our we have a magazine that we give out so instead of just like a one case like I used to have like a one page double side of like here's Jen McConnell and you know
[00:29:56] I was like I don't know is nothing impressive but like we have actually like magazine like we have a legit yeah so like this is the first thing anyone who needs anyone on you know my husband or I or we have another event you know that's the first thing that they see and then just elevating everything from there so like a closing book is a hard bound I mean this is like a little bit book you know and so just cool it's everything from their inspections to like if they had invoices from a pair's you know comments restrictions
[00:30:25] and the new construction we have their main one there so just elevating everything that we're doing to give that client experience so much more than they would ever expect by like that's our whole goal is to be able to do that and then we're intertwining that with who we really are so connected on that emotional level that who we are we're a family that's supporting them USC and by us supporting our business like we're able to do that on such a better level and then they want to get involved as well so we're just we're intertwined like where it's not just a transaction at all and it's not just a buyer sale
[00:30:55] so you know what I mean, that's not good at all and there were a investor like these are people who are in our lives that's the best part about it honestly.
[00:31:01] yeah it's like you're almost building a you know continuing to add to this giant family that's all helping each other so that, you know, the greater good can be, can be accomplished.
[00:31:11] You said so much here in the in the last few minutes I want to just unpack a little bit no no no no no no this is, no, in the best possible way you said a lot.
[00:31:20] I've want to talk about the truck because this is, it's a simple idea really, but I don't
[00:31:27] know.
[00:31:27] I've been doing this podcast five years, not one person has ever told me that they do
[00:31:31] this.
[00:31:31] I don't think anyone I've ever interviewed does.
[00:31:33] So you guys went out and acquired a smaller moving truck for, or I couldn't tell how big
[00:31:39] it is from the picture, but it was a really good sized truck that your clients can use
[00:31:43] sort of when they need it.
[00:31:46] So what was the impetus for that, just out of curiosity?
[00:31:50] So moving is never fun, like no matter how you are.
[00:31:55] And like yes, a lot of our clients definitely have the movers or even company or relocation
[00:32:01] company doing the things, but we did find a lot of clients who were just like running
[00:32:04] these e-halls and they break down and they're not cute, which is like, you know, what I love
[00:32:09] about ours.
[00:32:11] But like, you know, they're just not a fun thing and you have to go like all the way across
[00:32:14] town to get it.
[00:32:15] You can't return it there.
[00:32:16] It's just a pain.
[00:32:17] So we're like, what is one com to your service we could provide that can help them in
[00:32:23] this one issue, like this one obstacle that they keep hitting?
[00:32:27] Well, let's get them, let's get a moving truck, right?
[00:32:29] So we got this beautiful like 16 foot brand new moving truck and it's hard with floors
[00:32:34] in the bed because.
[00:32:35] Oh my gosh.
[00:32:36] Oh, I didn't realize it was that nice.
[00:32:40] Wow.
[00:32:40] It's so pretty like it has, you know, the sand ocean waves on the side and like a sand
[00:32:45] castle on the back like an issue such a cute truck, but the cool thing is like all of our
[00:32:49] clients love it.
[00:32:50] It's easy to drive this newer so it like turns normal and you feel like you're driving
[00:32:54] big SUV.
[00:32:55] But we do give it like the schools and our church whenever they need it.
[00:32:59] So it's just a nice tour that we can still give back, you know, to churches, charities
[00:33:03] whoever needs it at the time.
[00:33:04] And then our clients get the cool benefits.
[00:33:06] They don't have to worry about renting a truck and it is clean yet.
[00:33:08] It's a little dolly and there's a rain up and like it's just ready to go.
[00:33:11] Like it's just simplifying their life.
[00:33:12] Like that's what our concierge level is.
[00:33:16] I would expect and really requires that we just provide that next level service.
[00:33:20] So that was just one of the little things that we do.
[00:33:21] I love that and it's really, really smart also from a branding perspective because of
[00:33:27] course people get to see this truck driving around town that says, you know, hey, well,
[00:33:32] we'll use our truck if you if you use our services.
[00:33:34] I think that's, you know, obviously a constant source of, you know, exposure to the community.
[00:33:43] But it was interesting that you said sort of you were buying all almost all of your business,
[00:33:48] you know, three years ago.
[00:33:49] And it's not and now you're you're almost exclusively referral based and it's not that
[00:33:54] your margins have really changed.
[00:33:55] You're just taking that money and investing it back into the client experience versus,
[00:34:02] you know, the just meeting new people, right?
[00:34:05] This idea of deepening the client relationship.
[00:34:07] I'm assuming the theory is that by deepening the client relationship and really going way
[00:34:12] above and beyond what the client might expect even after the sale, then, you know,
[00:34:17] they're more likely to want to tell all their friends and family like, oh, you got to support the
[00:34:21] McConnell, you know, real estate business because, you know, look at how the all the cool
[00:34:26] stuff they're doing for the community and beyond.
[00:34:29] I'm assuming that was kind of the overall idea.
[00:34:33] Yeah, I mean, we just like, we love our clients.
[00:34:35] And I know most agents say that and they do like, we have fun with our clients.
[00:34:39] Like we go to like what we have a baseball game, we run out to me and like all their kids
[00:34:43] come, like I love seeing their kids grow older and get bigger and it's like, oh my gosh,
[00:34:47] you know, it's just, it's sweet or like the families who like moved here during COVID,
[00:34:51] and they don't have any families like we become their family, right?
[00:34:53] And so it's just like, you got to keep up with grandma grandpa.
[00:34:56] You got to keep up with like the kids and you got to just, you know, it's just such a fun
[00:34:59] relationship business that I think agents forget like they're like, it's just a
[00:35:03] transaction.
[00:35:03] Like once it closes, like, oh, here's your, your card and your closing get and like, you know,
[00:35:08] hopefully you'll keep my mind.
[00:35:09] But like, what's the statistics?
[00:35:11] Probably like what 86% I think is the set, like they totally forget who you are.
[00:35:15] Your, their agent is when they close on the house because you don't follow up.
[00:35:18] And like it's not just your following up, but like you genuinely should be interested
[00:35:22] in like your clients and what they have going on.
[00:35:25] Well, you mentioned, you know, paying attention to kids and grandparents and, and all
[00:35:29] of these things, these require systems, right?
[00:35:31] Because of course, with hundreds of clients, it becomes more and more difficult to be like,
[00:35:35] oh, so and so's child is entering first grade.
[00:35:39] And I should probably like reach out and just say, hey, oh, good luck with your, you know,
[00:35:43] first grade or whatever.
[00:35:45] But how do you do that?
[00:35:46] How do you keep it all organized?
[00:35:47] Because that's a lot of work.
[00:35:49] So you think about that right?
[00:35:51] So look at your client base and you figure out what pods they're in.
[00:35:54] So we have the newlyweds, no kids.
[00:35:57] We have kids, young family with, with young kids.
[00:36:00] We have families with older kids, you have, you know, retirees.
[00:36:03] So kind of break everyone up into your pods and then you say, all right, well, I'm a young family.
[00:36:07] What do I, or if I'm a young couple, don't have kids, I probably, what do I do?
[00:36:10] I'm going to go to happy hour, right?
[00:36:11] So like, all right, we're going to target them and do happy hour.
[00:36:13] And we know that, that probably, uh, Jen and Josh aren't coming because they have been
[00:36:16] in Bodea home because they can't get a big shot on a weekday.
[00:36:19] So like, we know that that's just going to be our first time on buyer,
[00:36:22] younger home buyers, or maybe even the next, we'll come happy hour.
[00:36:25] But then we know like the, the baseball game, right?
[00:36:28] We know that the kids, they're going to families with the kids are going to come to that, right?
[00:36:31] Well, if we go to a brand new restaurant downtown of the water,
[00:36:34] we know that's probably going to be more of our ancestors.
[00:36:36] Like, so look at your pods, who you're, your client bases and do those events,
[00:36:41] specifically for them.
[00:36:42] Like one thing that we do, for instance, for kids, like you were just saying about school.
[00:36:46] So every August, we take personalized cookie boxes to every single kid of our client.
[00:36:52] And it's that it has like three little cookies.
[00:36:54] Once like a pencil one is like an apple and one is a 12th floor.
[00:36:57] It has their name, Renault and says like, have a great first day of school, you know,
[00:37:01] Harrison or whoever.
[00:37:02] And we deliver those to their house, the first day of school.
[00:37:05] Like that's not something I have to be like, okay, Jonathan has a kid.
[00:37:08] You may have to have the kid like, I need to make sure I reach out to them individually.
[00:37:11] No, they know that every August, they need to look 30 nails.
[00:37:14] And they can register for that cookie box.
[00:37:16] So it's going to come to their inbox, you know, the first of August.
[00:37:18] We know that.
[00:37:19] So it's just a guarantee thing and that's a system, right?
[00:37:21] And so I just copy that e-blast from last August and I changed it to say this year's day.
[00:37:26] And it's coming out.
[00:37:27] So it's just super easy.
[00:37:29] So just things like that, like just really be intentional with your touches.
[00:37:33] It has something that we, we focus on.
[00:37:35] And then what do our clients really want to do?
[00:37:37] Like they don't want to come to my office like happy hour.
[00:37:39] No, I would I want to do that.
[00:37:40] I want to cool place.
[00:37:42] Oh, my God.
[00:37:42] I think both of my headphones are dead.
[00:37:43] That's okay.
[00:37:44] You're still sounding great.
[00:37:45] So keep going.
[00:37:46] Sorry.
[00:37:47] So just really again, like knowing your clients and targeting your business.
[00:37:52] So we look at our calendar year, we started November and we look at the whole next year.
[00:37:56] And every single month, we plan out exactly how we're going to touch our clients and what we're going to do with them.
[00:38:01] Like it, we're going to meet up in person.
[00:38:02] If it's not in person, we're going to deliver the cookies.
[00:38:04] That's not necessarily in person.
[00:38:05] And so you just kind of break it up and make sure that you're seeing them, you're talking to them.
[00:38:09] And obviously you're touching them with your emails.
[00:38:11] If they're not, if there's going to be more of you with everything else,
[00:38:13] or at least getting your emails.
[00:38:14] And if not, they're going to get your, you know, your quarterly newsletter that we mail out.
[00:38:18] You know, so this will have updates like the personal letter from me always.
[00:38:21] We usually always have something.
[00:38:22] This is about our gala.
[00:38:24] And then we always have something about the kids in there.
[00:38:25] Like this was our baseball.
[00:38:27] So they're still keeping in touch with us.
[00:38:29] Like even if they want to ignore us, that's totally cool.
[00:38:31] But I know that they're still getting, you know, this in the mail.
[00:38:33] I know they're just still getting our e newsletter.
[00:38:36] And you know, eventually they'll come out and come play if they want to.
[00:38:39] And if not, then that's fine too.
[00:38:40] They're at least they're they're in front of them.
[00:38:41] Yeah, it is, it is interesting.
[00:38:44] I once interviewed one of the top REALTORS here in Chicago.
[00:38:47] And I was asking her, you know, hey, why do you think you're so successful?
[00:38:51] And she was, she was like, I wish I had a better answer for this.
[00:38:54] But I reach out and call every single one of my clients every week and just give them an update on what's going on.
[00:39:00] And I was like, okay.
[00:39:02] And what else?
[00:39:03] She was like, well, that's kind of it.
[00:39:05] She's like, obviously, I do a lot of million other things.
[00:39:08] But she goes, I actually think that's the most important thing.
[00:39:11] And most agents don't do that.
[00:39:12] I was thinking as you were saying that to, you know, you were talking about sort of even after the sale, you know, doing,
[00:39:17] hey, every year we have the cookie thing for the kids and in the fall.
[00:39:21] And we, you know, we have all these fun events that people can attend.
[00:39:23] And they're going to get notified.
[00:39:24] And then they also get up my newsletter and, you know, other pieces of mail from time to time.
[00:39:29] But it seems like you really, really are focused on just constantly engaging with your client, your prospect list.
[00:39:38] And it really seems to be obviously very effective for you.
[00:39:43] And it's interesting because you're still spending the same capital you were before,
[00:39:46] but you're probably getting a better return, I would assume now, because you're now, you know,
[00:39:51] now it's people who, who, you know, who are clients.
[00:39:55] They're in love with you for what all that you guys do for them and for the, you know, the greater community.
[00:40:00] And then, you know, they're going to tell everybody they know.
[00:40:03] So it's really, it's really impressive.
[00:40:07] And so as a marketing person, what advice do you, would you have for somebody who is an individual practitioner?
[00:40:14] You know, somebody who doesn't have, maybe, you know, a ton of resources or a team.
[00:40:20] What might you suggest to them to sort of help start to make the transition from doing everything to maybe working on some systems or hiring?
[00:40:31] Starting out as a new agent.
[00:40:33] So well, for marketing, like you said, marketing, I think social media, for sure, it's free.
[00:40:38] You just need your time, which as a new agent, you have plenty of that would be for sure.
[00:40:43] But then your systems, I think definitely have to have a good CRM.
[00:40:46] We use follow up boss.
[00:40:47] There's a lot of really good ones out there.
[00:40:50] We've been, we've been very happy with follow up boss and probably always be with them.
[00:40:53] But that's one of our sponsors.
[00:40:55] We love follow up.
[00:40:56] Oh, yeah.
[00:40:56] I love follow up boss.
[00:40:58] I'm going to expand a follow up boss.
[00:40:59] Oh, good.
[00:41:00] Yeah.
[00:41:00] I'm just going to get go to the follow up boss conference in November.
[00:41:04] Yeah.
[00:41:06] So it really good CRM.
[00:41:07] Like even if you're just starting out, it's going to cost you money, but you have to invest to be able to get money out.
[00:41:12] One book that I would definitely recommend as a new agent would be profit first, go by that.
[00:41:16] Like that is really can get you in trouble if you are a new agent and you're just spending, spending, spending.
[00:41:21] I got to have the best business card, best yard signs, best open house signs.
[00:41:24] And then you don't even have a deal.
[00:41:26] Like do not go down that route.
[00:41:27] Like definitely reprofit first, but then once you get that money invested in that CRM, and it's going to be several thousand dollars.
[00:41:32] You're like, for real, like I don't get any of that commission.
[00:41:35] No, it has to go back into your business if you're serious about it.
[00:41:39] So I think that, and then there's just so many templates and follow up.
[00:41:42] As you know, that'll get you on a good path.
[00:41:45] If you don't have a good foundation with your brokerage, that kind of says like, here's how you really do the transaction.
[00:41:50] And here's what you should do for follow up.
[00:41:51] There's wonderful templates in that CRM as as many others, I'm sure.
[00:41:56] That would be my first purchase as a new agent for sure.
[00:41:59] And then like I said, social media, that's how you're going to get your business.
[00:42:03] If you don't, if you literally know no one and you don't have a good sphere where you are,
[00:42:06] and you can't afford to buy your bit leads, then social media for sure.
[00:42:10] And how if you if you were in that situation, I don't know, you're not anymore.
[00:42:14] But if you were, what would you pull post your marketing person?
[00:42:18] So I want to I want to press just a little bit and find out what kind of content would you post on social?
[00:42:22] Would you?
[00:42:23] And again, there isn't one, you know, right or wrong answer to this.
[00:42:27] But I'm curious on if you were starting out what type of because we, you know,
[00:42:32] we say that to our agents a lot here at our company, like, oh, you should, you know,
[00:42:36] really do a lot of branding and promoting on social.
[00:42:39] And finally, our agents were like, yeah, that's great.
[00:42:41] But like what content, you know, and so we had to really create a whole bunch of content that they could,
[00:42:46] they could borrow and use, but not everyone has that.
[00:42:48] So I'm curious.
[00:42:49] And if you were starting out new nobody and we're like, okay, I'm going to do something on social.
[00:42:54] What kind of content would, would you work on?
[00:42:57] So I would be the master of my market and your market would be very much like where you live.
[00:43:02] Like I live on Ile Palm.
[00:43:03] So I would be the master of Ile Palm, not Charleston.
[00:43:06] Like that's just too broad.
[00:43:08] So I would be the master of Ile Palm.
[00:43:10] I would have a hundred videos of Ile Palm.
[00:43:13] I would be doing open houses on Ile Palm, even though they weren't my listings.
[00:43:16] I would be going through go and shows and doing video tours.
[00:43:19] So even if they don't know that I'm not with a client, they're seeing I'm doing this five million dollar listing over the water and this.
[00:43:26] Vity pool and these ridiculous details, they don't know that I'm not actually with clients, but I'm in the real estate world.
[00:43:31] And they're going to know I'm in the real estate world by what I'm showing.
[00:43:35] So I would definitely be showing all of that on social media, but again, knowing your stats.
[00:43:39] So you need to know the stats for your market and be the expert.
[00:43:41] Oh, yeah, two, two, three, four, straight.
[00:43:43] I'll just sold for two point two.
[00:43:45] That's the highest one story that we've seen sold not off the ground in two years.
[00:43:50] Like you need to know your stats.
[00:43:52] And once you become the market expert and you're showing that through videos or reels or stories, or even just your your grid.
[00:43:58] You know, I think that you gain a lot of credibility that way and people call on you real quick on Instagram.
[00:44:03] Like, oh my gosh.
[00:44:04] And they feel like they know you, especially if they see you.
[00:44:07] I don't put myself on my own Instagram a whole lot because I feel like I'm like on the truck.
[00:44:11] I'm like everywhere.
[00:44:12] So I don't know.
[00:44:12] I'm worried about it.
[00:44:13] But I think that if I were a new agent, I for sure would be if I if I were to start now.
[00:44:19] I love that is providing content to the community in large about the community restaurants, school districts,
[00:44:28] you know, fun things that going on in the area, also knowing the market stats.
[00:44:33] And the Go and Show is such a great idea.
[00:44:36] That's so just just to we'll make this our final thing because I think you've given us so many amazing tips.
[00:44:41] But the Go and Show is so you would reach out to other realtories who have listings and say,
[00:44:45] Hey, I want to promote your listing.
[00:44:47] May I come over and do a quick video tour or because you if you don't have a client that actually wants to see it.
[00:44:53] Have you found that most listing agents are receptive to that?
[00:44:56] Do you get some pushback sometimes or are most
[00:44:58] never done pushback?
[00:44:59] No.
[00:45:00] So what you and basically in our showing time, you can actually just say virtual showing and you can just go through and video it.
[00:45:06] And then you can add it to your own real or whatever later and you can give them credit,
[00:45:09] which I think most agents appreciate on the list side.
[00:45:12] You know, just say like, Oh, Jen just listen to this awesome listing on waterway.
[00:45:15] Like they that goes far away.
[00:45:16] And then you get tagged on their their page as well, which is, you know, good for your page.
[00:45:22] But no, I mean, I've never had pushback.
[00:45:24] I do a million dollar Monday every Monday on my social media.
[00:45:28] And sometimes I'll use other agents listings for that and very rarely.
[00:45:32] There's been like three in like four years.
[00:45:34] And I'm just kind of like, OK, that's fine.
[00:45:36] If you don't need to help market your listing, that's.
[00:45:39] You know, I guess I guess I won't help give you exposure to sell.
[00:45:42] I know.
[00:45:43] I know why would you give that thing?
[00:45:44] I'm giving full credit, of course, to whoever it is.
[00:45:47] So who knows?
[00:45:52] If I want to think I lost you.
[00:45:58] Ask agents firms to.
[00:46:06] I think up anyway.
[00:46:08] So we've been.
[00:46:09] Jen, if you can are you still.
[00:46:10] I hear you now. Oh, good.
[00:46:12] No, no, no, it's not you.
[00:46:14] It's zoom is having an issue.
[00:46:16] So anyway, this is a great place to wrap up.
[00:46:18] So I want to mention just a couple of things about Jen.
[00:46:21] Number one, if you are a REALTOR and you have clients that, you know,
[00:46:25] vacation out in Charleston area or looking to maybe retire out there.
[00:46:30] Obviously a lot of people do.
[00:46:32] Jen would love to connect with you.
[00:46:33] So Jen, what's the best way?
[00:46:35] Or by the way, if there are any buyers, sellers, renters,
[00:46:38] who are listening to a show, who are, you know, either in the Charl
[00:46:41] scenario or moving there or want to explore different, you know, home options,
[00:46:45] there.
[00:46:45] What's the best way someone should reach out to you?
[00:46:48] They can call text directly by number is eight four three three hundred
[00:46:52] seventy five eighty five or my website.
[00:46:54] Definitely check out is CHS a states.com.
[00:46:57] And honestly, like we get a ton of vacationers.
[00:47:00] So even if agents are in town and just to have a local, you know, like coffee
[00:47:04] session, I would love to meet people from around the town.
[00:47:06] We have a ton of people relocating here from other areas.
[00:47:08] You have to sell their home, you know, where they are.
[00:47:11] So yeah, I'd love to have a coffee date with anyone.
[00:47:14] Well, I, that is the invitation is open.
[00:47:16] So anyone out there who has business in the Charleston area or who just
[00:47:21] wants to have a referral so that if business comes up, you can now say,
[00:47:25] hey, by the way, Mr. Mrs. Client, I know you're looking at, are looking to
[00:47:28] retire or maybe get a vacation home.
[00:47:30] You know, I know somebody out out in Charleston who, you know, who's,
[00:47:33] who's really good.
[00:47:34] So this is a great thing that you now can bring to your clients just by
[00:47:38] introducing, you know, yourself to Jen and getting connected that way.
[00:47:42] And vice versa, maybe she'll have people that are moving to your area.
[00:47:46] And so you guys can swap leads.
[00:47:48] So Jen, thank you so much for your, your service in, in, of course,
[00:47:54] the foundation that that you guys run in support and the causes that are
[00:47:58] important to you and also just being of service to this podcast.
[00:48:02] We are so grateful to have had you on the show.
[00:48:05] You're, you're just a, obviously, a really honest and compassionate and vulnerable
[00:48:10] person. And I think that is, that is always something that we can all aspire to be
[00:48:15] more of. So thank you.
[00:48:17] On behalf of our audience, we thank you for, for coming on the show and on behalf
[00:48:21] of Jen and myself, we want to thank our audience too for sticking around to the
[00:48:25] end. And we asked that you do just a couple of, oh, by the way, Jen,

[00:49:14] out there who's struggling trying to figure out their purpose in real estate. This might

Well, that's really all I got today. So let's get right to it, my interview with Jen McConnell. Okay, today on the show, our guest is Jen McConnell from Maccaddle Real Estate Partners in Charleston, South Carolina. Let me tell you more about Jen. Now Jen was fortunate enough to start her real estate career when she was just a junior in college. Now with over 17 years of experience in the industry, she has a particular expertise in luxury real estate and custom home building. She's a certified luxury home marketing specialist through the institute for luxury home marketing where she has been awarded the prestigious million dollar guild award. Jen has also earned the coveted REALTOR of Distinction Award, achieving the highest rank possible as a platinum award winner through the Charleston Trident Association of REALTORS. The platinum award Jen places in the top 2% of agents in Charleston. And in 2021, Jen and her husband Josh opened their own brokerage on the Isle of Palms in Charleston, South Carolina and for McConnell real estate partners where she is the broker in charge. Also, they run a foundation, which we're going to be speaking about as well to learn about everything Jen and McConnell real estate partners visit their website, CHS estates estates is plural CHS estates.com. There will be a link to that in the show notes. You can just go to our show notes, click on CHS estates.com and check out everything Jen and Josh. Jen, welcome to the show. Thank you. Thank you for having me. You've got it. I am so excited because Charleston is just one of those places that I just feel like everybody who visits it, you know, that I know seems to come back saying, oh, I wish I were to live there and you were telling me off camera that you're getting like 60 plus people a day move to the Charleston area, which is just incredible. From elsewhere, but not only that, but there are so many people that come here to vacation and then literally they just say they're like some little pack up my stuff. I'm just going to hang here until it's here. No, they really just haven't say something during COVID. Oh my gosh, the whole seat in New York just basically came here and they're like, oh, we're just not going to go home. We're just going to stay here now. We're going to move here and buy up. Which is obviously great for real estate agents. However, I imagine there's a lot more real estate agents probably getting their license these days. I assume it's probably I bet the real estate, the REALTOR populations, I don't know if it's doubled, but there's got to be more REALTORS now. So it's good. It's good. And it's also there's a lot of competition. I'm guessing. Yeah. I mean, we have close to 7,000 licensed agents. But you know, the top like 500 makeup 98 percent. They do it. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's funny. We do that in Chicago here. We have about 47,000 agents total and same sort of thing. It's like the top 20% do most of the because there's so many people that get their license as a part time thing or they just do it to buy and sell their own properties. But what's really cool about Charleston is you have you have like a lot of advantages, right? You have this beautiful, wonderful city, wonderful weather. You're you're you have beaches. You also have vacation rentals like there's so Charleston just had in the rich history, but just so much going for it. It's just oh, I'm so jealous. There's so much no matter what your life's salad, it's here in Charleston. I guarantee you know, my wife is the arts. If it you know, golf feed, I mean tennis is huge. I mean, everything voting like everything that you're finishing and you want to do is here for sure. Oh, I'm so jealous and I'm a tennis and not not as much of a golfer, but my dad's a golfer and you know, he's been in golfing all over the Carolinas for the last 30 years, like three, four times a year. So we we were lucky enough to go to Kewa Island. Actually, not together. I take it back. We didn't go together. We went different trips. I was thinking we did a father-son thing, but we didn't. But anyway, that's also right near you as well. That's amazing. Yeah, one of the most impressive courses on these coasts. The ocean course. Oh, yeah. You know, it's funny. I've not that our audience doesn't care about my golfing, but I will say if you if you're a golfer, you need to have an experience once in your life where you have a caddy. And the first time I ever had an actual caddy like walk with me through the course, which is very strange experience, was was at the ocean course in Kewa. And I was like, thank God, because I was like, what do I do here? It's like literally one of the hardest courses in the world. And I'm not okay enough about that. Nobody's paid. Nobody's logged out to hear my golf stories. We're talking about you. So how did you you started? You got into real estate when you were in college, which is not very common for the guests that I have on the show. So how did that happen and why? Sure. So when I was a year in college, I was a marketing and finance major and I had an internship. And I don't know. I just always knew that I was going to real estate somehow. And I don't know what kind of led me in the new construction realm. But I knew that there was a home builder on Highway 30 in Ashland, Ohio, which isn't where I went to college and where I grew up. And I just knew that that sounded like a really cool job. And I could do that as an internship. Or maybe they would pay me, maybe they wouldn't. So I just literally like walked in, I had my resume, I'm like 20 years old. And they were like, well, oh, we were hiring, but we're actually, we just hired this. So the spot, and I was like, well, that's just not going to work. I didn't seem to talk to your manager. Like that's all. Like I promise I'm not here. I just want to like a job, do your internship, and we find, like I just talked with them, and they eventually like edged my way in and let me talk to the manager. And then I'm getting it for like a sales assistant position. I was like, OK, well, this is cool. And then I was just, I loved it. I loved it. So it was custom construction at like 20 years old, you're designing these ridiculous houses. In Ohio, they were like, you know what you kind of see everywhere, like on a farm or you know, some nice houses for sure. But then they opened right when I was graduating. So a year later, and they were like, you want to go to Charleston and you're going to Wilmington? I was like, well, you know, never been to Charleston. Let's do that. Like I've heard it's great. Let's go there. Yeah. So I moved down to New York to know a person at all. I opened up their first stuff down to location in Charleston. Wow. And been down forever since. And you know, that, and I was 21 at that time designing like ridiculous beach houses, multi-million dollar beach houses. Like who gets that opportunity, right? Like it was just, it was wild. So that's really how I got my start in new construction. And then you construction for 11 years. And then once I got married, I started to have kids. And I was like, I don't really want to work six days a week. Like, I want to kind of have more flexibility with my schedule. So then I got my journal bookage license in 2008. And then actually didn't really start doing it full time until like 2016. Wow. Because you were busy doing mom stuff. And you were really like, I actually, so I had my kid and I had my daughter when I was still working in new construction. But literally like on maternity leave, I was like, I can't go back to six days a week. And we're going, you know, we're just going to general brokerage at that point. So that's when we kind of came back to Charleston, got on ILEPOM. And yeah, it's been a journal bookage in sense. So 2016, when I've been in general bookage. Wow. Well, you know, as somebody who I don't run our brokerage, but I know the work it takes as being part of the management staff at our brokerage. And you know, I almost wonder, are you working even more now that you run your own brokerage? Are you able to have better balance because you have, you know, some of that flexibility? You know, the work I balanced is an interesting topic. And then I've been several masterminds about that. But I do feel very close to that balance. So I found that if you're really stressed and running on fumes, there's either two things. One of two things were both missing either leverage or system. And I was missing both. Like in 2016 to like 2019, it was really just running on fumes. You know, I was doing I was the EA, I was the assistant, I was doing all the transaction paperwork. I was going over your clothes and whatever, I'm the section. I was selling, I was going listing. It's impossible, right? Like you can't keep up with that stuff. And by the way, you're a mom too. And I have like a one and a year old. So it's like, you know, it's not an ad or marriage. Like it's not sustainable. So I found that really quickly and we had a major life change in 2018. They kind of shook our world and that's when everything's going to be respected. To be honest with you that it was like, look, like it's just not going to operate that way. Like we deserve a better life than that and things just need to change because we just save our every moment we came with our children, ourselves, our marriage, you know, everything. So just kind of worked itself out that way. And now I'm just very focused on if we have a pain somewhere in our business, it's a system or a person that we're missing. And that's really what it comes on to. I think Wow, that's such a, it's a really concise and I was trying to sort of poke holes in it as I was thinking, is it always systems are people and okay, maybe it's not always that, but like probably 95% of the time. It was that. So I was thinking like it's true enough, you know, and I was just reflecting in my own business. Cause you know, whatever my own struggles and I was thinking, she's right. It's systems and people. So I think that is such a great point. And I always like to remind our audience too. If you hear this, you go, well, easy for them, their top producers and they have unlimited resources to be able to hire people. And it's like, well, maybe or maybe not, but the good news is for anyone listening who maybe is a solo practitioner, maybe is newer to the business and doesn't have those resources. You can hire help from all over the world these days, you know, using like upwork.com is a great place to look. And the point is, is you don't, if you, you know, if you can't afford someone local and you can have tasks that can be done, you know, virtually. Thank God there's so many options now and people can afford to have, you know, more of that virtual assistant experience at a really nice price point. Well, yeah, and I mean, I would honestly say like even three years ago, I was on a top producer. Like I was doing well at compared to everyone else in my office. I was at a big brokerage, but nothing compared to what I'm doing now. And it's just because I think it's more focused on those systems first. And then I hired the people that can help with help showing, help doing the EA work, help a personal assistant role, and really just allowing me to do what I'm good at, which is being in front of my clients, where helping them get deals, you know, listening home, I mean, that's what I'm good at as a part of people, not sitting here filling out my dot root. Talks, right? Like there's people that can do that other way better than I am at that type of work. And I phrase them for it because they just they know how to do it way better and I could never touch it. So why try. I couldn't agree with you more and it's I know it's hard to for a lot of our listeners and even for me as well. I'm not a practicing agent, but I work amongst agents and just this idea of giving over part of your business to, you know, to someone else to be able to handle. And it's like, what if they screw it up? What if they make mistakes? And and I understand the fear there. But was that challenging for you to be able to give up because again, you know, I can't do everything, but I'm used to doing everything. And if I give up my dot loop docs to someone else, what if, you know, it was at a fear of yours that like things would just all fall apart. Oh, 100% and it was so silly. Like I look back and I'm like, oh, I like really work skinned and bold like for years. Like what was I think is like, no, some little mess up a document. And then like I just it's better to do it myself. No, it's not 100% it's not. There is someone who is better with each skill set and you have to figure out what your top 20% should be and that's what you should focus on 100%. The other 80% that you're doing that you're not really that good at you to leverage that out for sure because they're going to have to be there. 1% and even with documents like transaction management companies are plentiful. They are all over. They charge I don't know three 400 bucks a deal and you only pay if the deal closes and then that person, you know, you have to find a good person, of course, but like you just, you know, there's a million ways to find good good, you know, people to help with that. It's like for 400 bucks to never have to deal with paperwork again per deal. It seems like a pretty good deal to me. Yeah, I mean, again, like I think that just saying in your language, I mean, husband, wife, you know, we own our breakfast together. So saying our language is very important. But saying in your lane with what you're good at and knowing what you're good at is like the first thing you should find out if you're just becoming a real estate agent. Like know what you're really good at. Sometimes those agents are better at the paperwork and maybe they need to be like an EA role and just a showing assistant. So they get the interaction with people, but they can still do their work, which really they love to check those boxes, whereas like I don't want to see the box. I just want to talk and I just want to go and I want to go to the houses and let's them into these marketing videos and do the fun stuff, you know, so I think just always finding your role and saying you're saying in your lane is super important and knowing what your role is coming as a new agent for sure. But yeah, I'm definitely do everything starting out 100% need to do that until you're too tired and and more now and hopefully you don't get to the as far as I got where I was like every day was working on like no breaks. You know, that's just not fun. You this we're here to live right and give back and that's what we I realized to kind of. In just few years ago, but like I said like three years ago, you know, my I did like eight million like that's not really a lot in our market at all. You know, and so I think implementing those things, implementing leverage, implementing. People and implementing systems like that's why we are where you know, we are today. So for sure. Yeah, I agree and I think it's a good place to talk about your sort of your true north and and what like because you and your husband have created a foundation and I want to you know, whatever you're willing to share about that I'd love to share that with our audience because I think you know, for somebody to find their why or true north is so critical especially right now when the real estate market is changed and people are REALTOR is a lot of them are struggling with that. And so that's really important to you. So back in 2018 of my son was 2017 actually who's born in July and it was five months old who is diagnosed with cancer here at MUSC Children Software One downtown Charleston. So that obviously was very earth shattering for us, but that day that he was diagnosed my I stopped I did not talk to clients. My phone was off emails were cut off social media was cut off. I didn't have to focus on getting him cured. So you know, that's scary for real estate especially I was I was just getting into general brokerage. I had just gone back in general brokerage 2017. So I was just getting back into it, you know, kind of getting a groove going and then you know that hits and you stop. So we didn't care about that at all. You know, I feel like everything will work out on the end. So he was cured fortunately by this five months or excuse me, 10 months birthday. I guess if you want to call it so by 10 months old he was cured of cancer, which was of course it's like the best you know, the best thing you could ever hear in your life. Like in the fact that I could say cured we were like wait, wait, did you say the scene words like you're like versus remission right? Right, right, right, like that's what we were expecting. She's like, no, you know, you're he's cured and you know that for us was just it's everything right. So that really propelled our business entirely and changed everything. So my husband left corporate America within six months of my son's cure simply because we just realized like the grind and being responsible to a corporation who kind of really doesn't care if you're here or not or what's going on in your life. They want you to be there and represent that really changed everything. So he came on board six months later left corporate America. Once our son would be able to go back to school. So there's kind of a lag once you're cured and when you can go back. I only worked you know six months that year and in that six months, I did $8 million. So that was my top year, you know, today as of then that was my. It's an amazing six months really. With all of the stress of what's going on. Yes. Well, my son did not ring and that was kind of something in the middle that you're thinking like, well dang like I thought I would have had like a call and no, my phone was dead. And I'm like, wow, you know, okay, we'll have to start over like it's all right. I can do that. I can start over again. It's fine. Like whatever I got to do to skip this boy here and a week before my son went back to school, my son's going to bring it again like it was just referrals coming in. Eight is from other markets sending referrals repeat clients coming back like it was a miracle. I mean, he's a miracle for sure, but like it was just that to me. I'm really just that's God that's that's enough and do it. So that that best year was definitely him. And then from there, we just kept doubling our business and it really comes down to at that point, where we realized like I'm not going to grind 24 seven not see my family, not see my kids, not see my husband. And then just you weren't out like who wants to go through life like that. So I were very intentional on where we spend our time. But then implementing those those systems and and the people that we really need to be able to run and run at a high rate. So you know, this year will do 45 million. And that was just three years ago where I did eight, you know, so yeah, it's amazing. And and this idea of it's almost like saving up for a rainy day in a sense because this idea that you guys had your your obviously your your child was struggling with a very serious illness and and and that takes every all of your attention. And of course the business does have to go on on pause. And then when you say when you come back, it's like, oh boy, my clients, you know, they've sort of disappeared for a while. And maybe they won't return. Maybe I do have to start over and this idea of building systems so that when, you know, really unfortunate things like that happen. And you know, there's there's ways to keep the business to some degree, chugging along. And so I imagine that's probably was motivation for you to that should should we need you know, should we want to spend more time, you know, at home or or with the kids or whatever the goals of the family are, you now have systems in place to support that. Right. Well, I mean, I literally used to have my client like my database was like self spreadsheet like I mean that was just three years ago. So it's like, you know, you have to find somewhere like to say that very humble beginning, but you know, yeah, it's just it's not sustainable again. So like why I was running the grind because like I had to make sure I hit all these people right how many times a day and how many different weeks and two weeks out through that on a self spreadsheet. It's not sustainable. So I'm sure most agents have something much more sophisticated now. Thankfully, but really what changed our business beyond just that is is having that northern star like we were talking about earlier and and that for us is to be able to give back to Bowdiez on call just my son's name is Bowdie. His oncologist is Dr. Jacqueline Krabakad and USC and she has one of the only pediatric research labs in South Carolina for cancer. So, you know, we just and I both had prayed to guys when we were in the hospital once we found out he was diagnosed and we were. We just said like it's he gets through this like we will do whatever we can. Sorry. No. It's okay. These are these are big things. So I appreciate I appreciate the biggest things honestly. Yeah. So I appreciate your appreciate your emotion. Yeah. And we just so we would do whatever we could to give back. And so you started a foundation and I the foundation is tell us about actually tell us about the foundation. Well, yeah. So the first thing that we did actually say 2018 he was cured 2019. What we decided to do with our brokerage was we started setting aside a portion of every commission and donating that to pediatric cancer research in 2019. We did 20 or yeah, 25,000 dollars and then 50,000 dollars the next year this year we're already over 65,000. So I think we'll be close to like 90,000 will donate just for the brokerage. So it which is awesome right and we involve our clients like this is a very transactional business. But on the buyer and seller side like it's a very relational relationship based business. And so what really came super clear to us once we knew that we wanted to kind of base our business around giving back to to doctor for back his research. So we need to really involve them into what we're doing. And so you know every email we update them on where we are with our MUSC goal for the year. We invite them to our fundraising events and if we have client events will have like a donate portion and you know it's not often because our clients just they come through for us and they're always so sweet like before we had our foundation they would literally just like hand us checks and we'd like we're here like I want to I want to go next year for a cause I'm like well I know but I can't take your. You're like donations from a brokerage so it's like you know how to look for the way that like I but I knew we could do so much more to right so. So what always do you know from our brokerage to decide that portion that will always give back to doctor back his research and the often things is for research to share on national level by the way like she shared with St. Jude and all these wonderful amazing hospital across the country so that's the cool thing is not just here that her research is going. But then so basically once clients kept paying that money and we're like guys but you can't do it that way. We were like you know what we can do it bigger we got a bit bigger and we just need to start our own foundation so in 2021 we started our own foundation the McConnell foundation and we had our very first gala last year in June and we raised $45,000 for our first gala for Dr. tobacco which was like really cool I know like I don't have a gauge because like I've never done that before but I mean I have great mentors in the industry and they were like to like that's really really impressive I'm like okay good I hope it's like I want to double it next year. I'm like I know like I love it so it's cool it's cool that we've done almost $120,000 in the last two years to emissive pediatric cancer research so it's you know we just want to make it a better. We just yeah I mean and again like that's why like I feel like I think given the skills in what I do real estate that is helping me give this life to someone else hopefully you know and and provide that research so that's really art that's our northern star like we were talking about earlier and that's why we do what we do when we are so clear focus on you know what we need to be able to provide for the research for sure. I mean that's such an interesting and an important thing that you said and I want to make sure that our audience really heard that because I suspect that when you when you and your husband and look at your brokerage and come up with sort of ideas of what you want to do for 2023 and beyond. I imagine you know a big part of the conversation is hey we want to raise X amount of money for or we want to donate and raise for you know this pediatric you know cancer research and that becomes a huge motivator to keep the business growing and operating versus just you know and there's nothing wrong with of course you know one's own salary and one's own own commissions but it is I imagine because of how much it impacted your family. That becomes a huge motivator so it's so interesting you said we just want to be able to donate more so in order to do that we have to do more business and and raise more money and I think that is such a such a really a beautiful thing and and really applaud you for for finding that north star and and then taking action right and realizing that so many people you know you know don't don't take that kind of action and not to judge them in a different way but it's not a good thing. But it's really something that's super admirable and and you get your entire community behind you as well and everyone now is is wanting you know wanting you to succeed so so I applaud you for that for sure. I want to pause for a moment to talk about our episode sponsor are one of my favorite companies out there follow up boss now after interviewing hundreds of top REALTORS in the country for the spot cast you know which CRM is used by more than any other by our guests of course it is follow up boss and let's face it following up.

And now back to our episode let's talk a little bit more about systems and you know because you know you were talking about and I've interviewed people on our show that that still work out of an Excel spreadsheet and that works for them and great but there are more sophisticated options and so I'm just curious on like how you went from Excel spreadsheet to more automation right I obviously yeah let's just tell me sort of what that journey was like for you. So the top priority of course we involved with clients is to ride the top tier level experience like we by kind of coin ourselves as a concierge level real estate and so we want to I think my earbuds are dying so sorry if you let me know if you can't hear me for some reason. No you're you sound great. So to provide that concierge level real estate not only just according to being in front of them but everything else so before they meet us you know what are they seen on our website or what they see in our social media so it comes down like for me on the marketing kind of behind our our brand and so I look more at our how we're presenting ourselves we have a client moving truck which is a 16 foot you know fully branded moving truck which our clients can use complimentary when they're moving or even if they just buy something you know and do so. So I think I'm going to go pick it up so just taking kind of the experience to the next level you know when we started in general brokerage in 2018 probably 75% of our business was bought leads whereas now I'm at 5% which really I'm not buying those are just major corporations that I pay referral fee to to help their exact so I do consider that thought but so we're at a 95% referral for you know we're key clients. And based now so what we've done but we're but our margins have not changed so what we did we took that money that you were using when you were buying your clients and I put it into the customer experience and that client experience from you know not just once they meet us all the way through years and years down the road so that's your kind of events but just elevating them and elevating everything that we do like we're our we have a magazine that we give out so instead of just like a one case like I used to have like a one page double side of like here's Jen McConnell and you know I was like I don't know is nothing impressive but like we have actually like magazine like we have a legit yeah so like this is the first thing anyone who needs anyone on you know my husband or I or we have another event you know that's the first thing that they see and then just elevating everything from there so like a closing book is a hard bound I mean this is like a little bit book you know and so just cool it's everything from their inspections to like if they had invoices from a pair's you know comments restrictions and the new construction we have their main one there so just elevating everything that we're doing to give that client experience so much more than they would ever expect by like that's our whole goal is to be able to do that and then we're intertwining that with who we really are so connected on that emotional level that who we are we're a family that's supporting them USC and by us supporting our business like we're able to do that on such a better level and then they want to get involved as well so we're just we're intertwined like where it's not just a transaction at all and it's not just a buyer sale so you know what I mean, that's not good at all and there were a investor like these are people who are in our lives that's the best part about it honestly. yeah it's like you're almost building a you know continuing to add to this giant family that's all helping each other so that, you know, the greater good can be, can be accomplished. You said so much here in the in the last few minutes I want to just unpack a little bit no no no no no no this is, no, in the best possible way you said a lot. I've want to talk about the truck because this is, it's a simple idea really, but I don't know. I've been doing this podcast five years, not one person has ever told me that they do this. I don't think anyone I've ever interviewed does. So you guys went out and acquired a smaller moving truck for, or I couldn't tell how big it is from the picture, but it was a really good sized truck that your clients can use sort of when they need it. So what was the impetus for that, just out of curiosity? So moving is never fun, like no matter how you are. And like yes, a lot of our clients definitely have the movers or even company or relocation company doing the things, but we did find a lot of clients who were just like running these e-halls and they break down and they're not cute, which is like, you know, what I love about ours. But like, you know, they're just not a fun thing and you have to go like all the way across town to get it. You can't return it there. It's just a pain. So we're like, what is one com to your service we could provide that can help them in this one issue, like this one obstacle that they keep hitting? Well, let's get them, let's get a moving truck, right? So we got this beautiful like 16 foot brand new moving truck and it's hard with floors in the bed because. Oh my gosh. Oh, I didn't realize it was that nice. Wow. It's so pretty like it has, you know, the sand ocean waves on the side and like a sand castle on the back like an issue such a cute truck, but the cool thing is like all of our clients love it. It's easy to drive this newer so it like turns normal and you feel like you're driving big SUV. But we do give it like the schools and our church whenever they need it. So it's just a nice tour that we can still give back, you know, to churches, charities whoever needs it at the time. And then our clients get the cool benefits. They don't have to worry about renting a truck and it is clean yet. It's a little dolly and there's a rain up and like it's just ready to go. Like it's just simplifying their life. Like that's what our concierge level is. I would expect and really requires that we just provide that next level service. So that was just one of the little things that we do. I love that and it's really, really smart also from a branding perspective because of course people get to see this truck driving around town that says, you know, hey, well, we'll use our truck if you if you use our services. I think that's, you know, obviously a constant source of, you know, exposure to the community. But it was interesting that you said sort of you were buying all almost all of your business, you know, three years ago. And it's not and now you're you're almost exclusively referral based and it's not that your margins have really changed. You're just taking that money and investing it back into the client experience versus, you know, the just meeting new people, right? This idea of deepening the client relationship. I'm assuming the theory is that by deepening the client relationship and really going way above and beyond what the client might expect even after the sale, then, you know, they're more likely to want to tell all their friends and family like, oh, you got to support the McConnell, you know, real estate business because, you know, look at how the all the cool stuff they're doing for the community and beyond. I'm assuming that was kind of the overall idea. Yeah, I mean, we just like, we love our clients. And I know most agents say that and they do like, we have fun with our clients. Like we go to like what we have a baseball game, we run out to me and like all their kids come, like I love seeing their kids grow older and get bigger and it's like, oh my gosh, you know, it's just, it's sweet or like the families who like moved here during COVID, and they don't have any families like we become their family, right? And so it's just like, you got to keep up with grandma grandpa. You got to keep up with like the kids and you got to just, you know, it's just such a fun relationship business that I think agents forget like they're like, it's just a transaction. Like once it closes, like, oh, here's your, your card and your closing get and like, you know, hopefully you'll keep my mind. But like, what's the statistics? Probably like what 86% I think is the set, like they totally forget who you are. Your, their agent is when they close on the house because you don't follow up. And like it's not just your following up, but like you genuinely should be interested in like your clients and what they have going on. Well, you mentioned, you know, paying attention to kids and grandparents and, and all of these things, these require systems, right? Because of course, with hundreds of clients, it becomes more and more difficult to be like, oh, so and so's child is entering first grade. And I should probably like reach out and just say, hey, oh, good luck with your, you know, first grade or whatever. But how do you do that? How do you keep it all organized? Because that's a lot of work. So you think about that right? So look at your client base and you figure out what pods they're in. So we have the newlyweds, no kids. We have kids, young family with, with young kids. We have families with older kids, you have, you know, retirees. So kind of break everyone up into your pods and then you say, all right, well, I'm a young family. What do I, or if I'm a young couple, don't have kids, I probably, what do I do? I'm going to go to happy hour, right? So like, all right, we're going to target them and do happy hour. And we know that, that probably, uh, Jen and Josh aren't coming because they have been in Bodea home because they can't get a big shot on a weekday. So like, we know that that's just going to be our first time on buyer, younger home buyers, or maybe even the next, we'll come happy hour. But then we know like the, the baseball game, right? We know that the kids, they're going to families with the kids are going to come to that, right? Well, if we go to a brand new restaurant downtown of the water, we know that's probably going to be more of our ancestors. Like, so look at your pods, who you're, your client bases and do those events, specifically for them. Like one thing that we do, for instance, for kids, like you were just saying about school. So every August, we take personalized cookie boxes to every single kid of our client. And it's that it has like three little cookies. Once like a pencil one is like an apple and one is a 12th floor. It has their name, Renault and says like, have a great first day of school, you know, Harrison or whoever. And we deliver those to their house, the first day of school. Like that's not something I have to be like, okay, Jonathan has a kid. You may have to have the kid like, I need to make sure I reach out to them individually. No, they know that every August, they need to look 30 nails. And they can register for that cookie box. So it's going to come to their inbox, you know, the first of August. We know that. So it's just a guarantee thing and that's a system, right? And so I just copy that e-blast from last August and I changed it to say this year's day. And it's coming out. So it's just super easy. So just things like that, like just really be intentional with your touches. It has something that we, we focus on. And then what do our clients really want to do? Like they don't want to come to my office like happy hour. No, I would I want to do that. I want to cool place. Oh, my God. I think both of my headphones are dead. That's okay. You're still sounding great. So keep going. Sorry. So just really again, like knowing your clients and targeting your business. So we look at our calendar year, we started November and we look at the whole next year. And every single month, we plan out exactly how we're going to touch our clients and what we're going to do with them. Like it, we're going to meet up in person. If it's not in person, we're going to deliver the cookies. That's not necessarily in person. And so you just kind of break it up and make sure that you're seeing them, you're talking to them. And obviously you're touching them with your emails. If they're not, if there's going to be more of you with everything else, or at least getting your emails. And if not, they're going to get your, you know, your quarterly newsletter that we mail out. You know, so this will have updates like the personal letter from me always. We usually always have something. This is about our gala. And then we always have something about the kids in there. Like this was our baseball. So they're still keeping in touch with us. Like even if they want to ignore us, that's totally cool. But I know that they're still getting, you know, this in the mail. I know they're just still getting our e newsletter. And you know, eventually they'll come out and come play if they want to. And if not, then that's fine too. They're at least they're they're in front of them. Yeah, it is, it is interesting. I once interviewed one of the top REALTORS here in Chicago. And I was asking her, you know, hey, why do you think you're so successful? And she was, she was like, I wish I had a better answer for this. But I reach out and call every single one of my clients every week and just give them an update on what's going on. And I was like, okay. And what else? She was like, well, that's kind of it. She's like, obviously, I do a lot of million other things. But she goes, I actually think that's the most important thing. And most agents don't do that. I was thinking as you were saying that to, you know, you were talking about sort of even after the sale, you know, doing, hey, every year we have the cookie thing for the kids and in the fall. And we, you know, we have all these fun events that people can attend. And they're going to get notified. And then they also get up my newsletter and, you know, other pieces of mail from time to time. But it seems like you really, really are focused on just constantly engaging with your client, your prospect list. And it really seems to be obviously very effective for you. And it's interesting because you're still spending the same capital you were before, but you're probably getting a better return, I would assume now, because you're now, you know, now it's people who, who, you know, who are clients. They're in love with you for what all that you guys do for them and for the, you know, the greater community. And then, you know, they're going to tell everybody they know. So it's really, it's really impressive. And so as a marketing person, what advice do you, would you have for somebody who is an individual practitioner? You know, somebody who doesn't have, maybe, you know, a ton of resources or a team. What might you suggest to them to sort of help start to make the transition from doing everything to maybe working on some systems or hiring? Starting out as a new agent. So well, for marketing, like you said, marketing, I think social media, for sure, it's free. You just need your time, which as a new agent, you have plenty of that would be for sure. But then your systems, I think definitely have to have a good CRM. We use follow up boss. There's a lot of really good ones out there. We've been, we've been very happy with follow up boss and probably always be with them. But that's one of our sponsors. We love follow up. Oh, yeah. I love follow up boss. I'm going to expand a follow up boss. Oh, good. Yeah. I'm just going to get go to the follow up boss conference in November. Yeah. So it really good CRM. Like even if you're just starting out, it's going to cost you money, but you have to invest to be able to get money out. One book that I would definitely recommend as a new agent would be profit first, go by that. Like that is really can get you in trouble if you are a new agent and you're just spending, spending, spending. I got to have the best business card, best yard signs, best open house signs. And then you don't even have a deal. Like do not go down that route. Like definitely reprofit first, but then once you get that money invested in that CRM, and it's going to be several thousand dollars. You're like, for real, like I don't get any of that commission. No, it has to go back into your business if you're serious about it. So I think that, and then there's just so many templates and follow up. As you know, that'll get you on a good path. If you don't have a good foundation with your brokerage, that kind of says like, here's how you really do the transaction. And here's what you should do for follow up. There's wonderful templates in that CRM as as many others, I'm sure. That would be my first purchase as a new agent for sure. And then like I said, social media, that's how you're going to get your business. If you don't, if you literally know no one and you don't have a good sphere where you are, and you can't afford to buy your bit leads, then social media for sure. And how if you if you were in that situation, I don't know, you're not anymore. But if you were, what would you pull post your marketing person? So I want to I want to press just a little bit and find out what kind of content would you post on social? Would you? And again, there isn't one, you know, right or wrong answer to this. But I'm curious on if you were starting out what type of because we, you know, we say that to our agents a lot here at our company, like, oh, you should, you know, really do a lot of branding and promoting on social. And finally, our agents were like, yeah, that's great. But like what content, you know, and so we had to really create a whole bunch of content that they could, they could borrow and use, but not everyone has that. So I'm curious. And if you were starting out new nobody and we're like, okay, I'm going to do something on social. What kind of content would, would you work on? So I would be the master of my market and your market would be very much like where you live. Like I live on Ile Palm. So I would be the master of Ile Palm, not Charleston. Like that's just too broad. So I would be the master of Ile Palm. I would have a hundred videos of Ile Palm. I would be doing open houses on Ile Palm, even though they weren't my listings. I would be going through go and shows and doing video tours. So even if they don't know that I'm not with a client, they're seeing I'm doing this five million dollar listing over the water and this. Vity pool and these ridiculous details, they don't know that I'm not actually with clients, but I'm in the real estate world. And they're going to know I'm in the real estate world by what I'm showing. So I would definitely be showing all of that on social media, but again, knowing your stats. So you need to know the stats for your market and be the expert. Oh, yeah, two, two, three, four, straight. I'll just sold for two point two. That's the highest one story that we've seen sold not off the ground in two years. Like you need to know your stats. And once you become the market expert and you're showing that through videos or reels or stories, or even just your your grid. You know, I think that you gain a lot of credibility that way and people call on you real quick on Instagram. Like, oh my gosh. And they feel like they know you, especially if they see you. I don't put myself on my own Instagram a whole lot because I feel like I'm like on the truck. I'm like everywhere. So I don't know. I'm worried about it. But I think that if I were a new agent, I for sure would be if I if I were to start now. I love that is providing content to the community in large about the community restaurants, school districts, you know, fun things that going on in the area, also knowing the market stats. And the Go and Show is such a great idea. That's so just just to we'll make this our final thing because I think you've given us so many amazing tips. But the Go and Show is so you would reach out to other realtories who have listings and say, Hey, I want to promote your listing. May I come over and do a quick video tour or because you if you don't have a client that actually wants to see it. Have you found that most listing agents are receptive to that? Do you get some pushback sometimes or are most never done pushback? No. So what you and basically in our showing time, you can actually just say virtual showing and you can just go through and video it. And then you can add it to your own real or whatever later and you can give them credit, which I think most agents appreciate on the list side. You know, just say like, Oh, Jen just listen to this awesome listing on waterway. Like they that goes far away. And then you get tagged on their their page as well, which is, you know, good for your page. But no, I mean, I've never had pushback. I do a million dollar Monday every Monday on my social media. And sometimes I'll use other agents listings for that and very rarely. There's been like three in like four years. And I'm just kind of like, OK, that's fine. If you don't need to help market your listing, that's. You know, I guess I guess I won't help give you exposure to sell. I know. I know why would you give that thing? I'm giving full credit, of course, to whoever it is. So who knows? If I want to think I lost you. Ask agents firms to. I think up anyway. So we've been. Jen, if you can are you still. I hear you now. Oh, good. No, no, no, it's not you. It's zoom is having an issue. So anyway, this is a great place to wrap up. So I want to mention just a couple of things about Jen. Number one, if you are a REALTOR and you have clients that, you know, vacation out in Charleston area or looking to maybe retire out there. Obviously a lot of people do. Jen would love to connect with you. So Jen, what's the best way? Or by the way, if there are any buyers, sellers, renters, who are listening to a show, who are, you know, either in the Charl scenario or moving there or want to explore different, you know, home options, there. What's the best way someone should reach out to you? They can call text directly by number is eight four three three hundred seventy five eighty five or my website. Definitely check out is CHS a states.com. And honestly, like we get a ton of vacationers. So even if agents are in town and just to have a local, you know, like coffee session, I would love to meet people from around the town. We have a ton of people relocating here from other areas. You have to sell their home, you know, where they are. So yeah, I'd love to have a coffee date with anyone. Well, I, that is the invitation is open. So anyone out there who has business in the Charleston area or who just wants to have a referral so that if business comes up, you can now say, hey, by the way, Mr. Mrs. Client, I know you're looking at, are looking to retire or maybe get a vacation home. You know, I know somebody out out in Charleston who, you know, who's, who's really good. So this is a great thing that you now can bring to your clients just by introducing, you know, yourself to Jen and getting connected that way. And vice versa, maybe she'll have people that are moving to your area. And so you guys can swap leads.
