[00:01:17] Today's episode is brought to you by Corded.io. Are you looking for agents to join your
[00:01:23] brokerage team? Now, as a real estate recruiter, I can tell you the answer is always yes.
[00:01:29] But most agents aren't looking to move right now. So how do you know who to contact?
[00:01:34] Well, what if I were to tell you there's a recruiting and retention tool powered by
[00:01:37] artificial intelligence that shows you exactly which agents in your local market are looking to
[00:01:43] leave their brokerage right now and which agents at your own firm are also looking to leave you?
[00:01:49] Now, I've been recruiting REALTORS for 15 years and I've hired over 2000 agents. I can tell you
[00:01:55] with no exaggeration, this is the tool I've been waiting for. Corded.io looks for trends across
[00:02:01] dozens of variables for each agent in your market and shows you which agents they believe are likely
[00:02:07] to move. Not only does it do that, but Corded.io went and visited my recruiting website and read
[00:02:13] everything I offer. So now when I'm recruiting, Corded.io tells me exactly what to say based on
[00:02:19] that agent's needs and what my brokerage can offer. It even writes emails for me. I've never
[00:02:24] seen anything like it and I use it every single day. Now, if you are looking to grow your brokerage,

[00:03:48] introduce them to our show. We appreciate you. All right, guys, let's get to the main event.
[00:03:52] My conversation with Ryan over cash.
[00:04:08] Today on the show, our guest is Ryan over cash from Castello real estate and investments in
[00:04:13] the Raleigh Durham area, North Carolina. Let me tell you more about Ryan. Now, Ryan is a 30-year-old
[00:04:19] REALTOR. By the way, this is part of our Rising Star series. So Ryan is absolutely a rising star.
[00:04:25] You're going to find out why right now. So Ryan's 30-year-old REALTOR in the Raleigh Durham
[00:04:29] market in North Carolina has been full time for a little over one year after working part time
[00:04:35] in real estate for two and a half years. He grew up very anxious, but competitive kid that played
[00:04:40] just about every sport you can think of, but ended up attending North Carolina State University,
[00:04:45] where he, for college where he received a bachelor's and master's in biology,
[00:04:51] despite spending his first five years working in pharmaceuticals, he was always interested in
[00:04:55] real estate and knew that one day would have a career in real estate. In his first year full time,
[00:05:01] he closed over five million in sales, amazing, and has already closed five and a half million in 2024,
[00:05:07] and we're only not even, we're about two-thirds of the way through the year. So his goal is to end
[00:05:13] the year with eight million, I suspect he'll do even better. He leverages his network from past jobs
[00:05:18] and career to grow his business now and almost solely focuses on a sphere of influence and social
[00:05:24] media, Facebook, and Instagram. Speaking of that, follow Ryan on Facebook and Instagram. On Instagram,
[00:05:29] he is Cash Rules Rally. Yes, Cash Rules Rally. I'm going to have a link to that in the show notes,
[00:05:36] again, his last name is Overcache. Cash Rules Rally and Search for Him on Facebook, Ryan Overcache.
[00:05:42] Again, we'll have a link to that in the show notes. Ryan, welcome to the show.
[00:05:46] Yeah, thanks for having me, DJ. Happy to be here. I don't know. I don't have all the answers,
[00:05:50] but happy to discuss what I've been doing for the time.
[00:05:52] Well, I was hoping you had all the answers because you're going to be my very last podcast episode
[00:05:56] of all time. I was like, I finally got the guy with all the answers at 30 years old.
[00:06:03] But you do have some of the answers because you're doing a lot of things that are really
[00:06:10] resulting in a pretty impressive start to this long career. And I think most agents don't have a
[00:06:17] great first year. And I know that you were also doing it part-time before, but let's start at the
[00:06:21] very beginning. Let's talk about, you went to college. Was it, you're in biology? Did you want to
[00:06:27] sort of go into medicine? I know you ended up in pharmaceuticals. I figure everyone I know who's
[00:06:32] a doctor started biology or one of those disciplines, just curious on what your original, by the way,
[00:06:37] that was my original path. And about a year in, I was like, oh, I am not, I do not have the
[00:06:42] intelligence for to do organic come and do all of that. So anyway, I'd love to hear your story.
[00:06:49] Yeah, funny enough, I, I guess, I didn't really know what I was going to do going into college,
[00:06:54] but I had always had this idea of becoming a dentist, which obviously I'm not a dentist now.
[00:07:01] But I still went through biology undergrad for four years, got that degree, still had no clue
[00:07:07] what I was going to do, bet the farm that I would get into this one graduate program at NC State.
[00:07:13] And luckily I did after, it was after I graduated too, that I found that I got into it. So,
[00:07:20] did that for two years. And yeah, that's kind of the journey through college. And obviously a lot
[00:07:25] happening in between there, but yeah, I got into real estate during college as well or got interested
[00:07:32] in it, I will say. When did, so you, you got your license out of college, you were still working
[00:07:38] in pharmaceuticals at that time? Yes, so I think if I recall dates correctly, I bought my house
[00:07:46] in 2020 and which was a crazy time to actually be buying a house. Definitely not an easy time, by the way.
[00:07:52] I bought mine in 2022 as well, so I can appreciate that. Yeah, so I was kind of lucky. I was in like a
[00:07:58] timeframe where no one was looking at houses. Me too. I think that was the same exact situation.
[00:08:02] Yeah, so very fortunate there, but I really just liked the process and considering I had already
[00:08:09] an interest in real estate investing, I was like, what's the worst that can happen if I just go get my
[00:08:14] license? So I think February 2021 is when I officially got the license but started the process before
[00:08:21] that and did it for two and a half years part time. And really was just focused on helping a
[00:08:27] friend here and there that was interested because I don't know, I found it hard to sell myself while
[00:08:33] I was part time because I didn't want to seem distracted from my full-time job. So yeah, it's probably,
[00:08:38] you know, it's probably a struggle that a lot of what we call dual career agents have, which is,
[00:08:44] you know, figuring out how to sort of service the client, you know, because clients don't really want
[00:08:51] part-time service, of course, but and we all know that part-time REALTORS are really full-time REALTORS
[00:08:56] anyway. They also have another job on top of that. So I know it is not an easy path, but was the
[00:09:03] dream always to sort of move into real estate as a REALTOR full-time or was that just something that
[00:09:09] naturally happened when you started getting more business? It had been flowed. I had weeks where I was
[00:09:14] like, I'm ready to quit my job and go do real estate full-time and then I had weeks where I'm like,
[00:09:19] I think I'm going to keep doing this pharma thing for another few years and see what happens.
[00:09:23] I never really thought it would look like what it does now. So I would say no that I thought I
[00:09:31] would be more interested in the investing side and do more of that early on, which didn't happen.
[00:09:36] Life happens a little bit, but no, I really did not even plan to go full-time and we had some
[00:09:43] changes happen at my last job and I was just those were kind of the nail on the coffin and I was
[00:09:48] ready to make that jump and in 2023 I had started to see my real estate business pick up even part
[00:09:54] time and I was like, maybe that's a sign that I have some legs behind this and I can make that
[00:10:00] jump and I had just paid off my student loans in early 2023 as well, which helped out.
[00:10:05] Sure. That's amazing. So there's a couple things about your story that I think a lot of our
[00:10:18] always knowing that that's exactly what you wanted and then having times where you knew it was what
[00:10:22] you wanted, but then maybe not. Everybody in their early part of their life as they start working as
[00:10:30] an adult, I think goes through versions of this, whatever industry they're in, it's like, am I in the
[00:10:34] right industry? My training was psychology and I never did anything in psychology specifically.
[00:10:41] I would have had to go to graduate school and maybe even go get a PhD and
[00:10:48] do any of those things and here I am now in real estate, which is something that I never would have
[00:10:52] expected or guessed and if you would have asked me, I would have been like, I don't know anything
[00:10:55] about real estate, back when I was starting in my 20s and early 30s even. So it's funny how life
[00:11:02] can kind of move us and push us into positions that maybe we didn't anticipate, but we can thrive in
[00:11:08] and you are certainly thriving. And I get jealous seeing some of not jealous for me, but just
[00:11:14] jealous for all of the agents I know who are listening who go, gosh, he's really doing well in his
[00:11:19] second year. But in your first year, and again, we should remember you were doing this part time
[00:11:24] for two and a half years, but when you really went into it full time, that's when
[00:11:29] sure bills have to be paid and it's not easy to thread that needle because of course we only
[00:11:36] get paid and maybe this will change someday, but we only get paid now when the deal closes, of
[00:11:40] course, and that can be months and months, even if you have a deal ready day one when you get your
[00:11:44] license, it's still going to be months away most likely. So I would love to dive into my first
[00:11:50] question to you is about prospecting because of course there's a great expression that I did not
[00:11:57] come up with. It's an old expression, but it seems to be fairly accurate, which is prospecting
[00:12:01] solve solve problems. And again, I don't know if that's absolutely true, but it's pretty
[00:12:06] clue. It's pretty true, at least for a lot of us. So you have done really well with your
[00:12:11] marketing efforts again. You are probably more known to the people in your life as the biology,
[00:12:18] maybe the dentist guy that's going to be a dentist or you know, pharmaceutical guy or the consultant,
[00:12:24] you also did consulting. So all of these things are, you know, probably you've done, you know,
[00:12:30] just as much of as real estate and yet you're having the successful year. And so I'd love to
[00:12:36] know when you decided to switch to real estate. My first question is, how did you go about figuring
[00:12:41] out the hardest part, which is where my client's going to come from? Yeah, so I will say this last
[00:12:50] October, which was three months after I had left my full-time job, I was thinking I might have
[00:12:56] made the worst decision ever because I did not have that many clients at that time. I had a few,
[00:13:02] I think, closings towards the end of the year, which helped me kind of get through that. And really
[00:13:07] my first year goal was to just be able to pay my bills. That would have been a great year. And
[00:13:12] I luckily I was able to do that. But I thought about how can I get clients early on even before I
[00:13:19] had left my job. And one thing I had right in front of me was my career in pharmaceuticals. And
[00:13:26] luckily that career that failed is a lot of very affluent, fairly well-off people that can buy and sell
[00:13:33] home. So that is really like the first network I approached to get out there and find clients.
[00:13:40] And that's, I wish I actually wish I had better numbers now that I'm on here, but that's probably
[00:13:45] been half of my sales over the last year is people from past jobs that I worked with.
[00:13:52] And I think they enjoyed getting to work with me in kind of a different world than what we did before.
[00:14:00] Was there any hesitation? And I'm not suggesting that you should have had this hesitation. I'm just
[00:14:05] speaking for a percentage of the audience that may have this hesitation. So they leave one career,
[00:14:10] they go into another one, they go back to the people in that original career like you did,
[00:14:14] said, hey, by the way, I do this other thing now. I know there can be hesitation going, but I'm
[00:14:20] brand new in this other thing are people going to want to work with me because I'm new. Did that?
[00:14:26] And you're a young guy too, that also could potentially create an, it's probably an invisible
[00:14:32] obstacle, but can feel like a real one. So I'm curious about, did you have some of those fears or
[00:14:36] concerns or how did you condition some of these past colleagues and friends that like, or,
[00:14:41] or is it just not an issue at all? You know, I haven't had the issue come up too much, but one
[00:14:47] thing that I think helped is I was at least half competent in my jobs. So the people generally
[00:14:52] liked working with me. Which was good at the last job. He's got to be good at this too. And
[00:14:58] that's actually a really important point. I love that. Yeah, and I think a lot of people actually,
[00:15:03] a lot of people told me to do this early and saw this coming ahead of time because they knew I
[00:15:07] wasn't fulfilled in my job, even though I, you know, did my thing at work and was a great teammate
[00:15:12] and tried to help people out at work. But they knew this change was coming and knew I would be
[00:15:17] much more excited about working in real estate than maybe some of the past things I've done.
[00:15:23] Because I think that energy is reflected by, you know, is reflected when I get work with them
[00:15:28] in real estate. Like I really enjoy doing this. I care about the details, the process,
[00:15:33] doing the hard work to, you know, maximize an outcome for them. So I haven't had too much pushback
[00:15:41] about being new to the industry. I definitely, I've sold some higher in homes, which was a little
[00:15:47] scary because, you know, you kind of think you're going to be put on this, you know, there's almost like
[00:15:53] you know, higher level expectation from a lot of those clients. And, sure, recently I had a
[00:15:58] confidence booster because I knocked one out the park and these are two people I worked with
[00:16:02] that are very smart, very detailed, very diligent, expect, you know, almost perfection. And it went
[00:16:08] amazing. So that definitely gave me some confidence. I think too is that's earned confidence because
[00:16:16] it wasn't like, oh, it just kind of went my way and like, thank goodness. And maybe it did to some
[00:16:20] degree go your way, that transaction. But it also these are demanding clients. They demand an
[00:16:26] educated competent agent and, you know, being a new agent, you know, you're only at, well,
[00:16:34] you're not so new, but you're new-ish. And you can only be so confident when you're new-ish. And yet
[00:16:39] I think it raises someone's game that either rise to the occasion, which you clearly did,
[00:16:45] or they fall apart and it falls apart. And I love that it helped probably maybe they even helped
[00:16:51] you raise your game a little because they were so demanding. And I love that. So I'm a big fan.
[00:16:57] It's like, you know, you I'm a tennis player and you always want to play with better people than
[00:17:01] you. You don't want to play with anybody less because it really directs down my game. If I play
[00:17:06] with somebody who's not as good as me. So I sort of like that. Like the idea of having clients that
[00:17:11] are a little tricky, but in a good way, I think probably, you know, did nothing but help. But also
[00:17:16] huge confidence was like, man, I could do this. And not only can I do these higher end listings,
[00:17:21] you know, these are people who might say, hey, I got we got this this young guy just did a great
[00:17:26] job for us. And, you know, they're probably hopefully spreading the word around town.
[00:17:33] Yeah. And people, I mean, people probably think I'm a little psychic for this, but I love
[00:17:37] negotiating too, which, you know, it's something I tell clients that I look forward to in these
[00:17:43] transactions. And a lot of people love to hear that because it's easy as a real estate agent,
[00:17:48] just kind of accept what you're given. And definitely being early on in my career, people probably
[00:17:54] don't expect me to enjoy that piece of it as much. But that's actually the one thing I probably
[00:17:59] would most forward to. Yeah. I think that's a really great skill to have because, and by the way,
[00:18:06] we should make a, I'm going to give a couple plugs right now. One is the certified negotiation
[00:18:11] expert CNE, which is one that is, I think you can get through NAR or certainly in Google that I
[00:18:16] know it is a good certification because when you're working with clients and they go, why should I
[00:18:20] be paying you? Hey, by the way, I'm a certified negotiation expert. I know how to get you the,
[00:18:25] either lowest price or the highest price, you know, for your property, for the property you want.
[00:18:31] So I am a huge fan of that. The other thing I'd encourage everyone to check out is a book called
[00:18:37] Never Split the Difference. It's a negotiation book by an FBI hostage negotiator. And it's awesome.
[00:18:42] And it will have you negotiating everything in your life from your utility bills to, you know,
[00:18:48] real estate. And again, it's what's interesting, Ryan, about what he said is, and again, I'm kind
[00:18:53] of hammering this a little hard, but I just think it's such a good differentiator is I really love,
[00:18:58] and it's true for you. I really love negotiating. Now, if I think about it, most people that I know,
[00:19:04] including myself, do not like to negotiate. I'm way too concerned with people liking me. So as a
[00:19:10] result, I don't want to negotiate with them because then that threatens maybe they won't like me if I
[00:19:15] offer something. I'm not a practicing REALTOR. So I wouldn't be a very good one if that isn't
[00:19:20] clear by now. But I love it when someone else is willing to negotiate on my behalf. And there's
[00:19:25] a monetary value associated with that too. So I know, of course, we think, well, of course, real estate
[00:19:30] agents negotiate. I don't think most real estate agents talk about the negotiation in advance at
[00:19:35] the beginning, be like, by the way, this is what I really love to do. I want to get you the very best.
[00:19:39] I think that comes through in your presentation and you face kind of lit up when you said it.
[00:19:46] And also it's really just a very valuable skill. So I really, very much appreciate that I did
[00:19:51] want to go one step back to when you first got started with the old clients. I apologize for
[00:19:57] going back, but I do want to just ask one thing because there's a lot of people who are listening
[00:20:01] who are like, why used to work at a job five years ago? And yes, it's been five years. A lot of
[00:20:06] people forgotten, but I still have people that work there. How might you suggest to reach out
[00:20:11] to people or how did you reach out to people that maybe you had worked with years before?
[00:20:17] And maybe, you know, was was how did you do that? Was it email? Was it phone, text, social media?
[00:20:24] Yeah, I mean, it was really just, well, actually, I will say it was actually co-workers
[00:20:29] introducing or saying like, hey, this person we used to work with is saying about buying a
[00:20:35] duplex. Could you, you know, you should reach out to them. And I know that person. So I just
[00:20:38] send them a text like, hey, John told me you were thinking about doing this. I'm pretty straightforward
[00:20:44] and and normal. Like it's okay to just send that text and be like, be pretty direct about it.
[00:20:49] Definitely if you feel that they already like you already, you don't have to put on your
[00:20:53] sales hat in a text message. You can provide them the information you have and see where it goes.
[00:21:01] You know, early on I was like, I don't want to know people. I don't want to do this. And that is like,
[00:21:06] people actually are looking forward to hearing from you, especially as we get older and we really
[00:21:11] probably have less communication with people from, you know, our past lives. Like people look
[00:21:16] forward to seeing your name pop up on their phone. I'm like, oh, I haven't thought to him in forever.
[00:21:21] 100%. Yeah, it's it is absolutely true that communication is is something that
[00:21:27] despite technology, making this appear more connected, you know, we've all seen the studies.
[00:21:33] People are lonelier than ever. And you know, any sort of reach out, whether it's, hey, I want to,
[00:21:39] you know, be your resource in case you ever want to buy yourself, or even just checking in with people
[00:21:43] is can be life changing for that other person. Like, hey, this person cares about me. And so I think
[00:21:49] I think that's really smart. I do want to talk about social media because you are a younger
[00:21:54] person in real estate. And again, I don't want to say that because you're 30 years old. That's not
[00:21:58] young. But certainly in this industry, that skews on the younger side. And people are always wondering,
[00:22:04] what are the what are the younger people doing to get business on social media? Everybody's on social
[00:22:08] media, of course. And I'm curious about what your strategy is for maintaining communication or
[00:22:15] possibly finding new clients. You know, how do you sort of think about, you know, leveraging your
[00:22:20] social media? You know, so I kind of have a role for myself. I talk about real estate as little as
[00:22:25] I possibly can until it's something that's just bugging me so much that I have to say it because I
[00:22:30] think it's an interesting take or would be interesting for people to hear. I, you know, I'm sure you
[00:22:36] see on Instagram or Facebook or whatever you're on that like people, a lot of really say,
[00:22:39] agents, they'll kind of like say the same thing over and over again. And it's not really like unique
[00:22:44] or interesting for their personal audience. Whereas like I try to do stuff that will really connect
[00:22:51] with people. Like recently I wrote an article about I literally broke down how much I made my first
[00:23:00] year, how much what that commission was. I was transparent about my issues, everything. And people
[00:23:06] loved it. I mean, they don't get that take from their real estate agent. They don't get to see those
[00:23:11] details. Nobody on social media shares how much they made like not just real estate agents. Nobody
[00:23:17] does that. And so think about I'm talking to the audience not Ryan. That is an incredibly courageous
[00:23:23] and vulnerable thing. And it really demonstrates an authenticity of here, here's me StripNaked to a
[00:23:31] degree, right? Here's here's how I did. And by the way, not a super sexy number. I'm guessing even
[00:23:37] though you had a great first year bottom line, not like the most impressive number to anyone, but
[00:23:44] hey, Warts and all like Oliver Carmel said, paint me with Warts and all. I love the idea of saying,
[00:23:49] this is the truth. Here's the truth. And people inherently are attracted to truth. They're
[00:23:55] inherently impressed by the courage to do that. It's like, oh, I couldn't do that. I couldn't,
[00:24:00] I wouldn't show my salary or the amount of money I made on social media because I'm way too afraid of
[00:24:05] I don't know something. Yeah, so I can appreciate that. So getting vulnerable is and that is,
[00:24:13] oh, that's a courageous one. Was that a tough one to send out or were you just like,
[00:24:16] I had food cares? Honestly, like, I'm pretty used, I've always just been interested in personal
[00:24:21] finance and like, I'm pretty used to talking about that stuff. And maybe I can't do that forever
[00:24:26] if things go very well. But I don't know, I'm actually kind of happy to share it. Like it gives people,
[00:24:34] it also gives people encouragement. Like I was in a very good career, making good money. And I was
[00:24:41] almost able to make that my first year in real estate. And it's like, I never felt that would happen
[00:24:47] to be honest. And it just goes, if you bet on yourself sometimes, it works out. And I like to share
[00:24:53] that with people. I went to see the director, Kevin Smith from clerks and malrats and anyone,
[00:24:59] people, people probably know him. But anyway, he's been making movies forever. I saw him speak
[00:25:04] he was, we got to see a movie that he made before the public many years ago. And he was talking
[00:25:09] about this, he goes, you should all bet on yourself. He goes, it might not work out. But what if it
[00:25:14] does? He was like, it can work out. And so this idea of betting on yourself is what you've done
[00:25:21] and it continued to do. So for social media, you are not talking about real estate all that often,
[00:25:27] unless it's like, I got to really talk about this. It's more about you as a person or is it your
[00:25:32] personal life or what are you sharing on social? So I actually wrote down right here that I try to
[00:25:37] do like a balance of, I would say 25% real estate, 75% just hobbies, interesting stuff, things I'm
[00:25:44] working on. I'm actually, my truck's been in the shop and I've been having two borrow cars and
[00:25:50] rent cars for two months. I'm on my seventh car this year. And I post enough like that. And it's like
[00:25:54] people are like, why are you doing this? Or, you know, people reach out. And it's just, it's a
[00:25:59] touch point that's not about real estate, but it keeps people connected with me. And like,
[00:26:03] you know, Mason shows I'm a normal person, not just someone who's trying to sell them all the time.
[00:26:09] And by the way, like being a truck guy, that's a certain, that's a group right there. A truck guys
[00:26:14] are in their own group and they love other truck guys. By the way, if everyone doesn't know this,
[00:26:20] I just learned this a few months ago because I bought a car. I had no idea how much trucks were.
[00:26:25] Like, like, I was like, oh my god, I had no clue that they were that expensive. Now I understand
[00:26:31] why people love their trucks. They're like a small fortune. But being like that, you know,
[00:26:37] obviously that's something that you're into has that as any of your hobbies attracted other people
[00:26:43] who are like minded. I know you're new in your career that might not have happened yet, but I'm
[00:26:46] curious. Yeah, I actually, I'm a big golfer. I know you said you play tennis. I'm a tennis person
[00:26:52] as well. I don't play as much as I used to, but I'm a big golfer now. And I've probably met,
[00:26:58] I would, I would guess 150 to 200 people over the last year just from golf network.
[00:27:05] And that's like, I'll go play with a friend and they'll bring two friends and just,
[00:27:09] you know, very organically meet people that way. And it actually has led to business as well.
[00:27:15] And it's like not really even I'm planning on getting business from it. I just do something
[00:27:19] that I enjoy with people. And organically those conversations come up and I'm able to generate
[00:27:25] business that way. I wouldn't say it's a primary driver or anything right now, but it's pretty cool,
[00:27:32] though. It's pretty cool. Well, you could do something that you enjoy like golf. And it just so
[00:27:36] happens that in golf, you meet strangers almost every time you play unless you come with a for some,
[00:27:41] you're going to get put on, you know, with other three other people most most of the time. And
[00:27:46] what's great about it, it's kind of brilliantly built into the sport is about three to four hours
[00:27:51] of talking. So there's a lot of time you might be writing in a cart with somebody or walking next
[00:27:56] to them, hold a hole. You feel can I've been playing golf my whole life as well, not not as into it
[00:28:02] as I am tennis. But you do feel connected to the stranger by the end. You're sort of like,
[00:28:08] ah, it's a bummer. I know it's not everyone's super fun, but the people that are you enjoy playing
[00:28:13] by the end, you feel bonded to them. And it's almost like, ah, I'm not sure you're going to see
[00:28:16] that guy again or whatever. So it really does lend itself well to real estate because you feel
[00:28:23] connected to somebody. They feel like they know you by the end of this 18 holes, at least better than
[00:28:28] if they met you at a cocktail party for five minutes. And there's this like, we just did this thing
[00:28:32] together. We had this shared experience. We probably had a few laughs or something funny happened
[00:28:36] during the court during the game. And then again, you know, they're going to need a real turn at
[00:28:41] some point and maybe just maybe they would choose me. I really think that if anyone out there
[00:28:46] is thinking about golf, it's probably, again, you can be successful with any activity getting into
[00:28:53] it. But golf is a really good one because you're just going to meet strangers all the time. And if
[00:28:58] you love it, you know, you're probably getting a ton of business. So I'm so glad you said that I
[00:29:01] have had very few people on the show that talk about golf. Maybe it's that real tears are oftentimes
[00:29:07] just so busy that they don't, you know, once you get to a certain level, you just don't have time.
[00:29:11] But I'm glad you brought that up because it obviously is working for you too. Let's talk about
[00:29:19] the trusting the process because I know that is something that can be very frustrating for agents.
[00:29:26] You know, we all hear this trust the process like, you know, the path to success in real estate
[00:29:31] has been well defined by lots and lots of different people. You pick sort of your preferred method
[00:29:36] and you know, you're told to trust. How challenging was it for you to trust that it was going to work out
[00:29:44] and, you know, how do you handle sort of the ups and downs? That's what I'd like to know.
[00:29:48] Yeah, I'm fairly impatient. So it's like as soon as I feel like something's not going right or
[00:29:53] not working, I was either reaching out to people or going to a networking event or something like
[00:29:58] that. And honestly, you should be a little more consistent with it than I probably was because I
[00:30:02] would get business and then those activities would die down a little bit and then I would be
[00:30:07] a little slower than I'd pick those activities back up. And that's a kind of a stressful
[00:30:12] way to do things to be honest. And it's naturally going to happen in this business. You're not
[00:30:17] always going to be perfect with your lead generation. But yeah, or I mean, last year, I remember very
[00:30:25] vividly, October, I was like, where in the world am I going to get business from? And then it's,
[00:30:30] I know this is cliche, but I went snowboarding in Big Sky in January. And while I was there,
[00:30:39] I got four houses under contract, which was like, okay, well, so maybe things aren't so bad right
[00:30:45] now. And, you know, I just I continue to have a good year after that and build on momentum.
[00:30:51] And honestly, people, you know, as I find more success, people see that more and more. I have more
[00:30:56] and stuff to post on social media more stuff to talk about. And just kept that rolling from there.
[00:31:04] But yeah, it's it's very hard early on. If people are starting out doing this, like stick as much
[00:31:10] money to the side as possible. The only thing I spend money on that's a luxury, I would say, is
[00:31:15] my golfing activities. Other than that, I'm putting it into marketing stuff or my business or
[00:31:20] client gifts or, you know, hosting something for friends or something like that.
[00:31:25] I love that you're investing in your business and you could argue that golf is also to some degree
[00:31:30] of business expense because certainly there's opportunity there that comes along with it
[00:31:36] in addition to, you know, the super expensive clubs and course fees and all of that.
[00:31:42] Yeah, I just I just played with my father. We play once he plays all the time, but I play once
[00:31:47] a year with him and I'm always shocked at how often or how expensive golfing is. But I will say
[00:31:56] people who are connected play golf get who tend to have more disposable income because it's
[00:32:02] expensive sport play golf. So for anyone looking, you know, again, don't play it if you don't want to
[00:32:07] play it, but if you want to play it, it's not the worst sport. You'll probably get further playing
[00:32:12] golf with your real estate business than maybe even tennis. I mean, I love tennis, but tennis is a
[00:32:18] pretty small circle of people and again, you can totally be the tennis agent and that would be
[00:32:22] awesome too. But I just love, you know, golf just seems to feel that niche. It's just the downside is
[00:32:28] it's a four hour commitment every time. Right. For some people, they love that and live in that.
[00:32:33] I wanted to talk about something that really doesn't get enough play, which is sort of going the
[00:32:40] extra mile. I know there's a story for you in every successful REALTOR has stories like this.
[00:32:46] But for those of you that are like, hmm, this is how you get people to become a raving fan. So
[00:32:52] do you mind just sharing the quick story about how you steam cleaned carpets the day of a before a
[00:32:58] house went live? So this was actually. Yeah, this was, yeah, I guess it was that day of this was my
[00:33:04] first transaction after going full time and there's a lot of interesting things to say about that
[00:33:08] transaction. It was a rough day every day of it. But yeah, I mean, I was new. I had time. I probably
[00:33:19] wouldn't do this now. Actually, I probably still would do it. But the client had we had to get their
[00:33:24] house like flips and listed within two weeks. Basically, this was an investor and I was not able to get
[00:33:31] the clean carpet cleaning people out there in time because other contractors didn't get out in time.
[00:33:36] So I went there. I rented something from a lowest home improvement, went out there at 2 a.m.
[00:33:43] got it done. It's funny. I videos that stuff too. I hope you videoed that because that's
[00:33:49] the amazing thing. Yeah, yeah. And I mean, I do that stuff and I don't complain about it. I don't
[00:33:54] hold it over like people's hands like, oh, well, I did this for you. Like I just do it. And you know,
[00:33:59] the people appreciate it. That seller was very happy with me by the end of that transaction. It
[00:34:04] was a very challenging transaction, I will say. So yeah, I mean, he was very happy with me. I do
[00:34:11] stuff like that. I'll take that extra trip to meet someone. I show up to everything. If clients
[00:34:17] have events going on, even if a baby shower, which I probably have no business being at, I go
[00:34:22] like it's small things like that. And that's why I love real estate. There are a lot of smart people
[00:34:31] in real estate, but you do not have to be the smartest person to do it. It is really a game of
[00:34:36] effort. Like I'm not saying everyone's going to be the Ryan Sirhan of the world. But if you just
[00:34:42] put in the effort, you will find a level of success that works for you. I interviewed the top,
[00:34:49] basically the top team in here in Chicago. And many, many years ago, I interviewed the head of
[00:34:56] that team. And I said, why do you think you're the most successful team? And he just looked at me
[00:35:02] dead in the eye and he goes, I work everybody. And I, he goes, I'm not smarter because I'm certainly
[00:35:07] not smarter. He goes, but I'm willing to work more hours than the average than any other agent.
[00:35:13] He's like, it's literally the only reason why now, again, work like balance. Yeah, he may be
[00:35:18] he struggles with that. I don't know. But that's what he told me. And that seems about right. You
[00:35:26] know, it's just hours. Usually ends up getting creating luck. I think luck is like this, you
[00:35:31] know, this, you just drill, drill, drill, drill. And eventually things kind of hopefully work out.
[00:35:37] Yeah. Yeah. And it is, I'm not like the hustle culture person either. I do work hard, but I,
[00:35:44] I do think people should take time for themselves and take care of themselves and have hoppy say
[00:35:49] enjoy and have stuff they do just for the fun of doing it. Like I'm going down to Pinehurst,
[00:35:54] this Saturday to hang out with some friends. But, but on Sunday, I'm going to be available for
[00:36:00] real estate activities probably every hour of that day. Just, I mean, that's how I prioritize things.
[00:36:06] Like, you know, I'm going to spend time with friends. I'm going to have hobbies. People always,
[00:36:10] you know, like when are you working? You're always on the golf course. And it's like, well, if you don't
[00:36:14] see me on, if you don't see a picture for me on the golf course, I am probably working. So,
[00:36:18] um, that's just how you play golf. Yeah, you're playing golf. Pinehurst has what like eight
[00:36:25] courses, nine courses, I forget what they actually might be building their 11th now. I'm actually
[00:36:30] only playing their part three course on Saturday and we're just hanging out the rest of the day.
[00:36:34] But see, that's a fun one. That's, I mean, I haven't played it. But I love part three course. Anyway,
[00:36:39] we're talking golf and probably most of us are like shut up about golf. I love that. But again,
[00:36:44] you're right. Yeah, having, and I think work life balance is everything. Yes, you're going to work
[00:36:50] probably more hours as a REALTOR than you would a traditional nine to five. You just are. It's just
[00:36:55] the way of the world. And the rewards are going to be much better. And you should still be mindful
[00:37:00] of your work life balance. So I love that you are not getting sucked into the whole, the hustle culture
[00:37:07] because yes, it can work, but at what cost, right? So it's like one of those things that, yep,
[00:37:12] yeah, you can work 18 hours a day if you really want to. And then, you know, you'll just have to
[00:37:18] be mindful of how does that affect my health? How does it affect my energy? And how, you know,
[00:37:22] and so I love that you've taken that into effect. I have a question for you because you've,
[00:37:26] you're still new to the business. But if you could go knowing everything you know now, or let's say
[00:37:32] the different way, a brand new agent comes to you and says, wow, you had a great first year.
[00:37:37] What would you do if you were me starting out right now? Just curious. So like, think about maybe
[00:37:42] what you did and maybe you would have even modified how you got started. So I'm curious what you would
[00:37:46] do differently or what you would say to somebody if they were starting out. So I would say the first
[00:37:54] thing you should do is get in touch with every person in your network. I people get distracted by,
[00:38:01] you know, I'm the first person to say do social media, but people get distracted by social media
[00:38:05] and online leads and all that kind of fancy stuff that is sold in the real estate world.
[00:38:11] In my, in my mind, I was like, if the people I know already aren't going to use me, then I'm not
[00:38:17] going to be that successful this probably. And they're the easiest people to sell right now. I don't
[00:38:21] even have to sell them. So I should reach out to them first. And I will say I was like fortunate to
[00:38:27] have a pretty good network already. So that might not be as easy for someone that's traveling or
[00:38:32] moving to a new city or something like that. But even then, like, you could go to one networking event
[00:38:39] a week that it doesn't have to be real estate related. It can be just a hobby you enjoy. And you
[00:38:44] would probably get two to three deals if you did that every week for a year. 100%. I mean, even just
[00:38:49] joining like the Chamber of Commerce and going and doing the events of like they're opening the
[00:38:54] new whatever Starbucks. So we're going to go, you know, be there at the celebration, like even stuff
[00:38:59] like that, not real estate stuff necessarily is really a fun way to get involved and just meet a
[00:39:05] bunch of fun people. Yeah. And there's probably a day that there's not a day that goes by that I
[00:39:10] don't text a friend or someone about, hey, let's go grab lunch next week. And it's not like I have
[00:39:16] an intention to get anything out of that. I just want to go see them and see how things are going
[00:39:20] that because maybe I'm lucky. I enjoy being in front of people. I don't enjoy the back-end stuff
[00:39:26] of this job. It is just tedious work that keeps me up till 11 o'clock a night every night.
[00:39:32] But I do enjoy being with people like yesterday. I was in that event. Very random. It was a bunch
[00:39:38] of guys that we kind of know each other on Twitter. We met at Raleigh Beard Garden here. And none of
[00:39:45] us had ever met before and you know, made a lot of great connections in person and put some faces
[00:39:49] to the avatars. And it was awesome. I mean, yeah, it can be that simple. I don't even really talk
[00:39:57] about real estate that much as I said. Just do stuff you enjoy. I think when you connect with people
[00:40:03] and you demonstrate that you care about them and that you're interested in their lives,
[00:40:07] then there's this reciprocity that just sort of naturally occurs where they feel more connected to
[00:40:13] you. And of course, when they have those needs, you don't have to tell them you're a financial advisor
[00:40:18] and insurance agent or a real estate agent or an attorney. They know what they know more than
[00:40:25] that is. Wow. This guy checks in on me once in a while. He cares about me, asks me how I'm doing,
[00:40:29] takes me to lunch. The good news is too. I love that. I think it was Scott Peck wrote this book,
[00:40:36] but you don't have to read the book. But the title says it all. It's not crowded along the extra mile.
[00:40:41] Like it just isn't. I'd love it. It can be a little lonely on the extra mile because you'd be like,
[00:40:46] wow, nobody else is maybe not as many people are doing it going the extra mile. But it is certainly
[00:40:52] a road to success. And I love that that you are taking time out every day to just check in with
[00:40:58] somebody see how they're doing. And then when they need you, they will find you. That's kind of
[00:41:04] the brilliance of it. And now it's one thing I would add to that. If you're someone that needs
[00:41:10] structure behind that that first week, just trying to reach out to 20 people. I mean, text 20 people.
[00:41:15] It doesn't have to be call. It doesn't have to be a DM. I just text 20 people, you know,
[00:41:19] and see what's up and see if they want to grab lunch on a free day coming up.
[00:41:23] And I even have a little, a little script I could say. So for anyone who's like, I feel a little
[00:41:27] nervous. I feel a little contrived. Here's what here's an easy way to sort of this is just,
[00:41:33] I was taught this is not my idea is call of and this actually applies to a different industry. But
[00:41:38] I think it applies perfectly to real estate. Call up a friend and say, hey, you know, I've started
[00:41:42] this new career. I would love to get your advice about something. I'm just working on my marketing
[00:41:46] plan. And I just wanted to ask your opinion, just make sure I'm on the right track. Can I take you
[00:41:51] to lunch? You know, I just need a few minutes, you know, I'll take you to, you know, grab a coffee
[00:41:56] or whatever. I'll meet you at your office. And then you could go down and say, okay, hey, I really
[00:41:59] want to get your thoughts. This is kind of how I wanted to brand myself. Like you could even bring
[00:42:03] to the other person some, you know, something that you might ask their opinion on because it's like
[00:42:09] the most flattering thing in the world to ask somebody's opinion about something. And therefore,
[00:42:14] you're not going, so do you need a REALTOR right now? Like you don't even have to do like, hey,
[00:42:18] I just wanted to like check it. You know me pretty well. I wanted to see. Do you think this feels
[00:42:21] like me? You know, and you could just ask them that. And it's so I, if anyone out there is a little
[00:42:26] nervous to contact people they know, do it that way. Be like, I was wondering if I could get your advice.
[00:42:31] And then you could say, hey, I really want to meet more people like you, like you be my ideal client.
[00:42:36] So if you were me, how would I find more people like you? Do you know, as you're like that? And then
[00:42:41] people will say, oh, we have a trade organization party that we do every or, you know, or come talk to
[00:42:45] my office. We have tons of people that need REALTORS and maybe bring lunch or something, you know,
[00:42:50] opportunities emerge sometimes. And does that happen from from sometimes these conversations that
[00:42:55] you have with people that even though it's not a real estate necessarily conversation, it ends up
[00:42:59] being an opportunity. 100% like so when I was in grad school, I had a good friend. I took some
[00:43:05] classes with and he moved on to West Hanson to be a teacher at a college up there like a
[00:43:11] notch for the internship program. And I just, I don't know why, but I had just randomly reached out
[00:43:17] to him one day just to see how things were going. We chatted and a week later he texted me like,
[00:43:22] hey, actually my buddy and Raleigh is, I was friends with him because we're car guys. And he's saying
[00:43:28] about selling his house and he doesn't have the fondest opinion of real estate agents and you're probably,
[00:43:33] and I don't either. And he was like, you're probably the only person that I would recommend
[00:43:37] to him. And I literally got a listing out of that this February, out of the blue, unexpected,
[00:43:43] was not reaching out for any particular reason other than I just like the guy and want to see
[00:43:47] what is up to him because he's interesting. And I mean, it worked out that way. And
[00:43:53] literally you meet one person, they might introduce you to that next person. That's the person that
[00:43:58] changes your business or changes your life. It might not even be your best friend. It might be the
[00:44:02] person they introduce you to. Yeah, so I mean, don't be scared to put yourself out there. And
[00:44:08] I will say early on you're going to be inefficient at everything. It's going to feel like a grind.
[00:44:14] You're going to be like, what do I have to talk about? I haven't even done anything yet.
[00:44:19] It still feels like that for me. It's like, you know, I'm lucky to have a great start, but there's
[00:44:25] someone this year who has sold 30x more real estate than I have. So, you know, there's levels to this
[00:44:33] for everyone. I wanted to bring up something that is very impressive to me about your business as
[00:44:41] sort of new-ish as it is, is that you are also getting calls from other agents who say, hey,
[00:44:48] I don't really hyper focus in the area that Ryan's, but, right, you specialize in. So I have this
[00:44:55] client. Maybe you can handle him. I'll take a referral fee, but I want you to handle it because
[00:44:59] you're going to do a better job. That doesn't happen to 30 year olds. And it is happening to you.
[00:45:04] I want to talk about how, how are you playing nice in the sandbox with other agents or playing so
[00:45:12] nice in the box that they're like, I'm going to send my referrals to this guy because that is a very
[00:45:19] impressive tell about how well you're doing is if other agents are like, this is the guy,
[00:45:25] that's a very nice confidence booster. But can you talk us through a little bit about how that works?
[00:45:29] Yeah. So, maybe I can get a little specific on that. Like, the triangle's a pretty big market and
[00:45:35] top to bottom, or east of west, you're probably driving an hour and a half to two hours and a lot of
[00:45:40] cases. So it's like that agent on the outskirts might not want to do business in that other shot of
[00:45:45] town. But I just, I like, I've networked a lot through social media with other agents in the
[00:45:51] area and then just organically met them through other events or met them actually on bigger pockets,
[00:45:56] forums or stuff like that. And I had a, even this past week, I had a buddy who was in St. Andrew's
[00:46:04] golfing and he was like, Hey, I, he's, I just client, they're really interested in these three
[00:46:09] homes. They want to see him this week because they're moving down from Massachusetts. I obviously
[00:46:13] can't help them right now. Do you think you could, you could help them? It's actually better fit
[00:46:17] for your area anyways. And I was like, of course, so it's really just being present. I, you know,
[00:46:22] answered quickly. I know the guy will. We talk about investing quite a bit. So it's, I mean, just
[00:46:30] being trustworthy that you're going to take care of people you're going to do the right thing by
[00:46:34] someone that they care about. And it's in a day like if he can have those clients back on the
[00:46:39] next transaction, I'm not a petty or a gatekeeping person. Yeah, I'm going to serve them very well.
[00:46:45] If they want to work with me again, the future five, they want to work with him fine, but
[00:46:50] it is like that is a great feeling for me because it shows that, you know, other people believe in me.
[00:46:58] Yeah, it's the greatest compliment because again, that agent, you know, it's their client or
[00:47:04] someone that was referred to them and they don't want the reputation tarnished by giving that
[00:47:09] lead over to somebody who maybe doesn't do a great job. And so to put that faith in a younger
[00:47:15] agent who's, you know, it really is a real testament to how, how a professional you are with
[00:47:21] your, with your clients. And I wanted to also ask a little bit about the changes that are happening
[00:47:30] with the NAR settlement. And I'm not interested in, you know, talking about sort of what agents think
[00:47:36] about it because we all have our opinions. But have you as a new agent, you're like thrown
[00:47:42] right in the middle of this and you saw how it, of course, how it used to be and now you're seeing
[00:47:47] how it's changing. Are you concerned, nervous, do you feel prepared? You know, we're two days at
[00:47:57] the time of us recording this, we are two days away from the changes going into effect, which
[00:48:01] basically changes, you know, possible compensation. It's decoupled. We now, you know, have to sort of
[00:48:07] secure our own, our own buyer side, possibly a commission. So I'm just curious on, you know,
[00:48:15] if you're feeling nervous about that or if you feel prepared, you know, how are you doing?
[00:48:19] Yeah, I mean, I think a lot of people will tell you they're not concerned. I had actually,
[00:48:24] I am a, change is concerning for me because things could happen overnight. They could happen in
[00:48:29] six months that really change like the fabric of this business and what I'm doing. And it's
[00:48:35] funny, like, of course, this happens. I'm flush with more buyers than I've ever had in my life.
[00:48:40] And so I'm having to have those interesting conversations repeatedly. But honestly, I'm just
[00:48:44] building that skill set. And I, you know, I'm telling my buyers like, hey, I'm trying to get my
[00:48:51] commission paid for either by the seller or through a closing credit. But, you know, this is the
[00:48:57] situation if I'm not able to do that. And to be honest, like I will say, if we get to a situation
[00:49:03] where my commission is the difference between them, not getting or not getting a house will negotiate
[00:49:09] it. Like that's fine. It will always negotiate it anyways. But, yeah, I'm not concerned about
[00:49:16] the messaging. I am concerned about the actual business changing. Because I think over time,
[00:49:24] you could see commissions change. And will it be worth it to work with buyers in the same process
[00:49:31] that we have in the past? I don't know because it could make going that extra mile a little harder.
[00:49:36] Yeah. Yeah, it could make it just inefficient enough or unprofitable enough to drive agents away
[00:49:44] from buyer representation. Or we, you know, as an industry do such a good job of educating buyers
[00:49:52] that the transition is a little bit, you know, more smooth. But it's certainly going to be
[00:49:57] uncomfortable here. And yeah, I was going to say, like, people are going to want some type of
[00:50:02] representation. So there is value there. There is money to be made for agents there. That might
[00:50:09] change. Like, maybe people all for more of a limited service in the future that, you know, maybe
[00:50:13] they're doing more like contract review and negotiation, scheduling, all that stuff.
[00:50:18] I could definitely see a world where it's easier for a buyer to get into a house without an
[00:50:23] agent. Obviously that a lot would have to change in between now and that happening. But I could see
[00:50:28] a world where that happens or it becomes a thing. So the business model could just change. There's
[00:50:34] always real estate is one of the biggest industries in the world. If not the biggest, there's always
[00:50:38] going to be opportunity within it. And like the people who are top producers and successful say
[00:50:43] they're not worried because they'll just adapt to it. That is the best lesson. I think I could
[00:50:50] I couldn't have said it better myself because I will tell you after interviewing hundreds and
[00:50:55] hundreds of top one percenters and agents in the country, some of the very, very top of the
[00:51:00] mountain people and asking them this question. Some of them got asked this question too. Not one
[00:51:06] of them was concerned. And it wasn't because, oh, my clients will just pay for it. I'm not
[00:51:09] worried about it. That wasn't the reason why they said I've adapted. I know how to present this.
[00:51:15] I know my numbers. I've practiced my pitch. And if it, you know, I'll find out how it works. And
[00:51:21] and a lot of them had been doing it anyway. A lot of buyers agents had been doing this for years. I
[00:51:27] had no idea. I did not know other agents were actually doing buyer representation and talking
[00:51:33] about commissions saying you might come out of pocket for this. I met an agent who's been doing it
[00:51:37] for eight years, a very successful agent. I was like, did you ever get pushback? He goes never
[00:51:42] once. He goes, now I explained it. He goes, so when this change is coming, he's like, it's not a
[00:51:48] change for me. And he goes, I go, have anyone ever had to pay out of pocket a buyer? He goes,
[00:51:53] happens all the time. I go, really? Do you get pushback? Not once. And I go, that's, that's all I
[00:51:59] ever need to hear. Because now I'm not, now I know the model works. And of course, lots of people have
[00:52:04] done this. But again, I think you're right. It's about pivoting. And it's about not focusing on,
[00:52:10] you know, it's that old, is it the prayer of Saint Francis? I'm not a Catholic guy, but I think
[00:52:14] it's the peristate Francis, but it's like, or not maybe not per, anyway, whatever it's the, oh,
[00:52:18] no, no, it's a serenity prayer. Sorry, serenity, I'm not a, I'm not a Catholic. So I don't, I did
[00:52:22] go to Catholic school, but I'm not Catholic. But it was, you know, you can only change what you can
[00:52:26] change essentially. It's what the prayer says is don't focus on what you can't change because you're
[00:52:31] basically just throwing your fist into a wall. And that's exactly right. Because if we adapt,
[00:52:36] there's always opportunity. It's, you know, it's, it's, it's like, you don't, you know, it's the same
[00:52:41] sort of opportunity comes in the most, in opportune times too. Like, yeah, you know, if you're in the
[00:52:48] market and you're buying securities, stocks and bonds and things, you know, you want to go, you
[00:52:53] want to buy them at the low. You don't want to buy them when things are good because obviously,
[00:52:57] for obvious reasons, but it doesn't feel good to buy something when it's, when it's, you know,
[00:53:01] depressed. So getting over some of those, so the pivoting doesn't have to feel good.
[00:53:05] It probably won't feel good. In fact, if it does feel good, you're probably not pivoting correctly.
[00:53:10] It probably should feel a little like, I mean, I don't know if this is going to work, but you're
[00:53:14] just going to do it anyway. And you're going to get the result. But like you were saying, nobody,
[00:53:19] oh, well, you and I don't like change. I don't like change either. It's scary to me. I like routine.
[00:53:23] I like the same. And yet, I'm in an industry that changes all the time. So I appreciate that.
[00:53:29] One last question for you is, what are the skills you're currently working on that? Because,
[00:53:37] you know, you're still new to the business. What are, what would you like to get better at?
[00:53:41] I would like to be, well, I have actually a couple of items I would like to focus on moving forward
[00:53:48] here. I would like to get better at more targeted direct mail. So intertwining my hobby and job,
[00:53:56] I would actually like to become almost like the North Carolina, like golf course expert.
[00:54:01] And like, kind of tie that into real estate as well and kind of like focus a lot of my
[00:54:06] marketing towards those types of neighborhoods and understanding them, understanding not just like
[00:54:10] the neighborhood, but the golf experience there and what it has to offer. So I'd like to focus
[00:54:15] more on that. And that in itself could be almost a separate business down the line.
[00:54:21] That is it. I'm putting my, I'm always wearing a marketing hack because that's my background.
[00:54:26] I've never heard of anybody doing this. And it's such a brilliant idea because golfers care
[00:54:31] about this kind of thing. Golfers want to live near golf courses. They want to know how easy it is
[00:54:37] to get in. They want to understand the course experience. And you live in an area with lots of
[00:54:42] golf courses. So it's not like we only have five courses knowing everybody knows them. No,
[00:54:46] there's probably a hundred courses, you know, within, within several hours of you. And you could
[00:54:52] be the guy making the YouTube videos of I'm the real estate agent that's going to show you what it's
[00:54:56] like to play golf in this neighborhood and consider maybe even moving to this neighborhood. Here's
[00:55:01] the experience of living there playing or whatever. Oh, I could see that as a, I could see that as
[00:55:07] this own YouTube channel. Yeah, I had a moment one day while I was playing and I saw an advertisement
[00:55:11] for a real estate agent in that neighborhood. And not to be agist or sex or anything here,
[00:55:19] but it was a rather old lady who had like asked the agent for that golfing neighborhood. I'm like,
[00:55:24] the people that live here probably don't resonate with her and, you know, as much as they might with
[00:55:30] me, especially if it's a younger crowd there. So like I was like, maybe there's an opportunity there
[00:55:36] to start doing more direct focus advertising these neighborhoods. And then also just playing
[00:55:41] nine holes and videoing it and posting it up on my YouTube or social media and be like,
[00:55:47] and have a real understanding of the golf course and what holes are great to live on, what holes
[00:55:52] are you do want to stay away from like stuff like that. Yeah. And also to like what to play next,
[00:55:58] right? Like all of us are always like, hey, what's the next best course that I've never heard of.
[00:56:02] But you are, cool. I see a huge opportunity there. I fully expect in a year you'll have this
[00:56:08] sort of YouTube channel with all of these golf, either living in a golf community and sort of
[00:56:15] knowing the figuring that out or just, hey, golfers, I'm the real estate golfer. I'm going to show you
[00:56:21] the, you know, the best courses in the area and we're going to walk them together and I'm going to do
[00:56:25] the, you know, I so much opportunity. And I want to love watching stuff like that.
[00:56:29] One other thing I recognized is it's very hard to find data for the different neighborhoods
[00:56:35] and like what they have to offer. So I was like, I could put together a list of like the 50 private
[00:56:41] courses and the triangle of North Carolina, what initiation fees, what dues there are,
[00:56:48] like what amenities each of those neighbors have, who it, you know, what's the median price point
[00:56:51] in that neighborhood and almost do like a, probably like a Facebook ad or Google ad for that marketing
[00:56:57] material and collect email addresses that way. That's an idea, you know, it's a little work or not,
[00:57:03] but it's worth trying in my opinion. I love it. And again, we're listening to Ryan's creative
[00:57:08] process right now. And so I love that you're sharing that with our audience because you're having
[00:57:13] success. These are the kind of thoughts that that we want to have is how do I, how do I marry
[00:57:18] together something that's really interesting to me in a way that's useful to people in the community.
[00:57:23] And if you can do those two things and then put content out that specifically addresses,
[00:57:29] here's, you know, how to address these questions or concerns about people who are into this hobby
[00:57:35] and also maybe are in this particular community. You know, you're gonna, you're gonna, people
[00:57:40] search on YouTube for questions to answer and that, you know, could be is, hey, I'm thinking I'm
[00:57:46] joining a private club. What are the initiation costs? I would, you know, yes, of course, because
[00:57:51] golfers too, anytime there's a private course, they're like, I wonder what it costs to join this club.
[00:57:55] Yeah, like that's, that's a thought every golfer has had whenever they're playing a private
[00:58:00] course. You're like, this is pretty nice. I wonder what, what the costs. And, you know, it's not
[00:58:03] easy to get that information unless you ask somebody who's a member there and they might not even know.
[00:58:08] But, um, but yeah, how long does it take to become a member? That's another thing too. Like,
[00:58:12] my sister lives on a course in Florida where it's a 10 year weight period if she wants to do it.
[00:58:16] It's crazy. Just insane. It's crazy. It's, it's crazy. But she only knew that because she called
[00:58:22] them and said, how long is the weightless? Anyway, Ryan, you are doing some really great things. I hope
[00:58:28] to continue to follow you and watch your, your success as you continue to do more and more production.
[00:58:34] I want to thank Ryan on behalf of our audience for, you know, coming on, spending some time. I know
[00:58:41] you don't have a ton of time, but you spend it with us today. I appreciate that. Let's follow Ryan
[00:58:45] on Instagram. Cash rules Raleigh. So we're going to have a link to that in the show notes and also
[00:58:51] right over cash. You can find him on Facebook. He, by the way, he's the REALTOR that agents in his
[00:58:58] market are sending referrals over. So if you are outside of that market, the, you know, or inside
[00:59:03] the market and you're looking for an agent to refer business to, obviously he's doing something
[00:59:08] right. So he might be a great connection point for you, our listener. And by the way, people move
[00:59:14] out of Raleigh Durham as well. And they go south sometimes and maybe when they're retiring, although
[00:59:19] it's a pretty, you don't have to go too far south when you're in North Carolina. It's pretty beautiful
[00:59:23] everywhere. But they people move out. So Ryan needs people agents to refer to as well. So connect
[00:59:29] with him. Let him know you appreciated him being on the show. And let's follow him on Instagram.
[00:59:34] Because I, if I was an agent practicing right now, I just kind of take notes from what Ryan's doing
[00:59:40] on social media and probably do the same thing. So check out what Ryan's doing. Reach out to him
[00:59:44] on behalf of Ryan and myself. We want to thank the audience for sticking around to the end. We
[00:59:49] appreciate you guys the best. And thank you. We are podcast no joke. This is the absolute truth
[00:59:55] has had its most successful month ever last month. And this month where I'm paced to do it.
[01:00:01] This after seven years, we could not be happier that everyone seems to still enjoy the show. And
[01:00:06] please tell us how we can improve the show because we can always do better as well. Also,
[01:00:10] tell a friend about the show. Leave us a review. Let us know what you think. And if there's an agent
[01:00:15] in your local market that you're like, I want to know what that person's doing. Let us know who that
[01:00:19] person is. We will, we will get them on the show. So Ryan, thank you so, so much. Appreciate you.
[01:00:25] And love to see your star rising. And we'll continue to watch it rise. And we'll also continue to
[01:00:31] watch you pivot as things change. So let's keep our eye on Ryan and send him some business. If
[01:00:36] you have people in that area and also, you know, he might be sending you business too. So Ryan,
[01:00:42] thank you so much. And we will see everybody on the next episode. Thanks, DJ.

My conversation with Ryan over cash. Today on the show, our guest is Ryan over cash from Castello real estate and investments in the Raleigh Durham area, North Carolina. Let me tell you more about Ryan. Now, Ryan is a 30-year-old REALTOR. By the way, this is part of our Rising Star series. So Ryan is absolutely a rising star. You're going to find out why right now. So Ryan's 30-year-old REALTOR in the Raleigh Durham market in North Carolina has been full time for a little over one year after working part time in real estate for two and a half years. He grew up very anxious, but competitive kid that played just about every sport you can think of, but ended up attending North Carolina State University, where he, for college where he received a bachelor's and master's in biology, despite spending his first five years working in pharmaceuticals, he was always interested in real estate and knew that one day would have a career in real estate. In his first year full time, he closed over five million in sales, amazing, and has already closed five and a half million in 2024, and we're only not even, we're about two-thirds of the way through the year. So his goal is to end the year with eight million, I suspect he'll do even better. He leverages his network from past jobs and career to grow his business now and almost solely focuses on a sphere of influence and social media, Facebook, and Instagram. Speaking of that, follow Ryan on Facebook and Instagram. On Instagram, he is Cash Rules Rally. Yes, Cash Rules Rally. I'm going to have a link to that in the show notes, again, his last name is Overcache. Cash Rules Rally and Search for Him on Facebook, Ryan Overcache. Again, we'll have a link to that in the show notes. Ryan, welcome to the show. Yeah, thanks for having me, DJ. Happy to be here. I don't know. I don't have all the answers, but happy to discuss what I've been doing for the time. Well, I was hoping you had all the answers because you're going to be my very last podcast episode of all time. I was like, I finally got the guy with all the answers at 30 years old. But you do have some of the answers because you're doing a lot of things that are really resulting in a pretty impressive start to this long career. And I think most agents don't have a great first year. And I know that you were also doing it part-time before, but let's start at the very beginning. Let's talk about, you went to college. Was it, you're in biology? Did you want to sort of go into medicine? I know you ended up in pharmaceuticals. I figure everyone I know who's a doctor started biology or one of those disciplines, just curious on what your original, by the way, that was my original path. And about a year in, I was like, oh, I am not, I do not have the intelligence for to do organic come and do all of that. So anyway, I'd love to hear your story. Yeah, funny enough, I, I guess, I didn't really know what I was going to do going into college, but I had always had this idea of becoming a dentist, which obviously I'm not a dentist now. But I still went through biology undergrad for four years, got that degree, still had no clue what I was going to do, bet the farm that I would get into this one graduate program at NC State. And luckily I did after, it was after I graduated too, that I found that I got into it. So, did that for two years. And yeah, that's kind of the journey through college. And obviously a lot happening in between there, but yeah, I got into real estate during college as well or got interested in it, I will say. When did, so you, you got your license out of college, you were still working in pharmaceuticals at that time? Yes, so I think if I recall dates correctly, I bought my house in 2020 and which was a crazy time to actually be buying a house. Definitely not an easy time, by the way. I bought mine in 2022 as well, so I can appreciate that. Yeah, so I was kind of lucky. I was in like a timeframe where no one was looking at houses. Me too. I think that was the same exact situation. Yeah, so very fortunate there, but I really just liked the process and considering I had already an interest in real estate investing, I was like, what's the worst that can happen if I just go get my license? So I think February 2021 is when I officially got the license but started the process before that and did it for two and a half years part time. And really was just focused on helping a friend here and there that was interested because I don't know, I found it hard to sell myself while I was part time because I didn't want to seem distracted from my full-time job. So yeah, it's probably, you know, it's probably a struggle that a lot of what we call dual career agents have, which is, you know, figuring out how to sort of service the client, you know, because clients don't really want part-time service, of course, but and we all know that part-time REALTORS are really full-time REALTORS anyway. They also have another job on top of that. So I know it is not an easy path, but was the dream always to sort of move into real estate as a REALTOR full-time or was that just something that naturally happened when you started getting more business? It had been flowed. I had weeks where I was like, I'm ready to quit my job and go do real estate full-time and then I had weeks where I'm like, I think I'm going to keep doing this pharma thing for another few years and see what happens. I never really thought it would look like what it does now. So I would say no that I thought I would be more interested in the investing side and do more of that early on, which didn't happen. Life happens a little bit, but no, I really did not even plan to go full-time and we had some changes happen at my last job and I was just those were kind of the nail on the coffin and I was ready to make that jump and in 2023 I had started to see my real estate business pick up even part time and I was like, maybe that's a sign that I have some legs behind this and I can make that jump and I had just paid off my student loans in early 2023 as well, which helped out. Sure. That's amazing. So there's a couple things about your story that I think a lot of our always knowing that that's exactly what you wanted and then having times where you knew it was what you wanted, but then maybe not. Everybody in their early part of their life as they start working as an adult, I think goes through versions of this, whatever industry they're in, it's like, am I in the right industry? My training was psychology and I never did anything in psychology specifically. I would have had to go to graduate school and maybe even go get a PhD and do any of those things and here I am now in real estate, which is something that I never would have expected or guessed and if you would have asked me, I would have been like, I don't know anything about real estate, back when I was starting in my 20s and early 30s even. So it's funny how life can kind of move us and push us into positions that maybe we didn't anticipate, but we can thrive in and you are certainly thriving. And I get jealous seeing some of not jealous for me, but just jealous for all of the agents I know who are listening who go, gosh, he's really doing well in his second year. But in your first year, and again, we should remember you were doing this part time for two and a half years, but when you really went into it full time, that's when sure bills have to be paid and it's not easy to thread that needle because of course we only get paid and maybe this will change someday, but we only get paid now when the deal closes, of course, and that can be months and months, even if you have a deal ready day one when you get your license, it's still going to be months away most likely. So I would love to dive into my first question to you is about prospecting because of course there's a great expression that I did not come up with. It's an old expression, but it seems to be fairly accurate, which is prospecting solve solve problems. And again, I don't know if that's absolutely true, but it's pretty clue. It's pretty true, at least for a lot of us. So you have done really well with your marketing efforts again. You are probably more known to the people in your life as the biology, maybe the dentist guy that's going to be a dentist or you know, pharmaceutical guy or the consultant, you also did consulting. So all of these things are, you know, probably you've done, you know, just as much of as real estate and yet you're having the successful year. And so I'd love to know when you decided to switch to real estate. My first question is, how did you go about figuring out the hardest part, which is where my client's going to come from? Yeah, so I will say this last October, which was three months after I had left my full-time job, I was thinking I might have made the worst decision ever because I did not have that many clients at that time. I had a few, I think, closings towards the end of the year, which helped me kind of get through that. And really my first year goal was to just be able to pay my bills. That would have been a great year. And I luckily I was able to do that. But I thought about how can I get clients early on even before I had left my job. And one thing I had right in front of me was my career in pharmaceuticals. And luckily that career that failed is a lot of very affluent, fairly well-off people that can buy and sell home. So that is really like the first network I approached to get out there and find clients. And that's, I wish I actually wish I had better numbers now that I'm on here, but that's probably been half of my sales over the last year is people from past jobs that I worked with. And I think they enjoyed getting to work with me in kind of a different world than what we did before. Was there any hesitation? And I'm not suggesting that you should have had this hesitation. I'm just speaking for a percentage of the audience that may have this hesitation. So they leave one career, they go into another one, they go back to the people in that original career like you did, said, hey, by the way, I do this other thing now. I know there can be hesitation going, but I'm brand new in this other thing are people going to want to work with me because I'm new. Did that? And you're a young guy too, that also could potentially create an, it's probably an invisible obstacle, but can feel like a real one. So I'm curious about, did you have some of those fears or concerns or how did you condition some of these past colleagues and friends that like, or, or is it just not an issue at all? You know, I haven't had the issue come up too much, but one thing that I think helped is I was at least half competent in my jobs. So the people generally liked working with me. Which was good at the last job. He's got to be good at this too. And that's actually a really important point. I love that. Yeah, and I think a lot of people actually, a lot of people told me to do this early and saw this coming ahead of time because they knew I wasn't fulfilled in my job, even though I, you know, did my thing at work and was a great teammate and tried to help people out at work. But they knew this change was coming and knew I would be much more excited about working in real estate than maybe some of the past things I've done. Because I think that energy is reflected by, you know, is reflected when I get work with them in real estate. Like I really enjoy doing this. I care about the details, the process, doing the hard work to, you know, maximize an outcome for them. So I haven't had too much pushback about being new to the industry. I definitely, I've sold some higher in homes, which was a little scary because, you know, you kind of think you're going to be put on this, you know, there's almost like you know, higher level expectation from a lot of those clients. And, sure, recently I had a confidence booster because I knocked one out the park and these are two people I worked with that are very smart, very detailed, very diligent, expect, you know, almost perfection. And it went amazing. So that definitely gave me some confidence. I think too is that's earned confidence because it wasn't like, oh, it just kind of went my way and like, thank goodness. And maybe it did to some degree go your way, that transaction. But it also these are demanding clients. They demand an educated competent agent and, you know, being a new agent, you know, you're only at, well, you're not so new, but you're new-ish. And you can only be so confident when you're new-ish. And yet I think it raises someone's game that either rise to the occasion, which you clearly did, or they fall apart and it falls apart. And I love that it helped probably maybe they even helped you raise your game a little because they were so demanding. And I love that. So I'm a big fan. It's like, you know, you I'm a tennis player and you always want to play with better people than you. You don't want to play with anybody less because it really directs down my game. If I play with somebody who's not as good as me. So I sort of like that. Like the idea of having clients that are a little tricky, but in a good way, I think probably, you know, did nothing but help. But also huge confidence was like, man, I could do this. And not only can I do these higher end listings, you know, these are people who might say, hey, I got we got this this young guy just did a great job for us. And, you know, they're probably hopefully spreading the word around town. Yeah. And people, I mean, people probably think I'm a little psychic for this, but I love negotiating too, which, you know, it's something I tell clients that I look forward to in these transactions. And a lot of people love to hear that because it's easy as a real estate agent, just kind of accept what you're given. And definitely being early on in my career, people probably don't expect me to enjoy that piece of it as much. But that's actually the one thing I probably would most forward to. Yeah. I think that's a really great skill to have because, and by the way, we should make a, I'm going to give a couple plugs right now. One is the certified negotiation expert CNE, which is one that is, I think you can get through NAR or certainly in Google that I know it is a good certification because when you're working with clients and they go, why should I be paying you? Hey, by the way, I'm a certified negotiation expert. I know how to get you the, either lowest price or the highest price, you know, for your property, for the property you want. So I am a huge fan of that. The other thing I'd encourage everyone to check out is a book called Never Split the Difference. It's a negotiation book by an FBI hostage negotiator. And it's awesome. And it will have you negotiating everything in your life from your utility bills to, you know, real estate. And again, it's what's interesting, Ryan, about what he said is, and again, I'm kind of hammering this a little hard, but I just think it's such a good differentiator is I really love, and it's true for you. I really love negotiating. Now, if I think about it, most people that I know, including myself, do not like to negotiate. I'm way too concerned with people liking me. So as a result, I don't want to negotiate with them because then that threatens maybe they won't like me if I offer something. I'm not a practicing REALTOR. So I wouldn't be a very good one if that isn't clear by now. But I love it when someone else is willing to negotiate on my behalf. And there's a monetary value associated with that too. So I know, of course, we think, well, of course, real estate agents negotiate. I don't think most real estate agents talk about the negotiation in advance at the beginning, be like, by the way, this is what I really love to do. I want to get you the very best. I think that comes through in your presentation and you face kind of lit up when you said it. And also it's really just a very valuable skill. So I really, very much appreciate that I did want to go one step back to when you first got started with the old clients. I apologize for going back, but I do want to just ask one thing because there's a lot of people who are listening who are like, why used to work at a job five years ago? And yes, it's been five years. A lot of people forgotten, but I still have people that work there. How might you suggest to reach out to people or how did you reach out to people that maybe you had worked with years before? And maybe, you know, was was how did you do that? Was it email? Was it phone, text, social media? Yeah, I mean, it was really just, well, actually, I will say it was actually co-workers introducing or saying like, hey, this person we used to work with is saying about buying a duplex. Could you, you know, you should reach out to them. And I know that person. So I just send them a text like, hey, John told me you were thinking about doing this. I'm pretty straightforward and and normal. Like it's okay to just send that text and be like, be pretty direct about it. Definitely if you feel that they already like you already, you don't have to put on your sales hat in a text message. You can provide them the information you have and see where it goes. You know, early on I was like, I don't want to know people. I don't want to do this. And that is like, people actually are looking forward to hearing from you, especially as we get older and we really probably have less communication with people from, you know, our past lives. Like people look forward to seeing your name pop up on their phone. I'm like, oh, I haven't thought to him in forever. 100%. Yeah, it's it is absolutely true that communication is is something that despite technology, making this appear more connected, you know, we've all seen the studies. People are lonelier than ever. And you know, any sort of reach out, whether it's, hey, I want to, you know, be your resource in case you ever want to buy yourself, or even just checking in with people is can be life changing for that other person. Like, hey, this person cares about me. And so I think I think that's really smart. I do want to talk about social media because you are a younger person in real estate. And again, I don't want to say that because you're 30 years old. That's not young. But certainly in this industry, that skews on the younger side. And people are always wondering, what are the what are the younger people doing to get business on social media? Everybody's on social media, of course. And I'm curious about what your strategy is for maintaining communication or possibly finding new clients. You know, how do you sort of think about, you know, leveraging your social media? You know, so I kind of have a role for myself. I talk about real estate as little as I possibly can until it's something that's just bugging me so much that I have to say it because I think it's an interesting take or would be interesting for people to hear. I, you know, I'm sure you see on Instagram or Facebook or whatever you're on that like people, a lot of really say, agents, they'll kind of like say the same thing over and over again. And it's not really like unique or interesting for their personal audience. Whereas like I try to do stuff that will really connect with people. Like recently I wrote an article about I literally broke down how much I made my first year, how much what that commission was. I was transparent about my issues, everything. And people loved it. I mean, they don't get that take from their real estate agent. They don't get to see those details. Nobody on social media shares how much they made like not just real estate agents. Nobody does that. And so think about I'm talking to the audience not Ryan. That is an incredibly courageous and vulnerable thing. And it really demonstrates an authenticity of here, here's me StripNaked to a degree, right? Here's here's how I did. And by the way, not a super sexy number. I'm guessing even though you had a great first year bottom line, not like the most impressive number to anyone, but hey, Warts and all like Oliver Carmel said, paint me with Warts and all. I love the idea of saying, this is the truth. Here's the truth. And people inherently are attracted to truth. They're inherently impressed by the courage to do that. It's like, oh, I couldn't do that. I couldn't, I wouldn't show my salary or the amount of money I made on social media because I'm way too afraid of I don't know something. Yeah, so I can appreciate that. So getting vulnerable is and that is, oh, that's a courageous one. Was that a tough one to send out or were you just like, I had food cares? Honestly, like, I'm pretty used, I've always just been interested in personal finance and like, I'm pretty used to talking about that stuff. And maybe I can't do that forever if things go very well. But I don't know, I'm actually kind of happy to share it. Like it gives people, it also gives people encouragement. Like I was in a very good career, making good money. And I was almost able to make that my first year in real estate. And it's like, I never felt that would happen to be honest. And it just goes, if you bet on yourself sometimes, it works out. And I like to share that with people. I went to see the director, Kevin Smith from clerks and malrats and anyone, people, people probably know him. But anyway, he's been making movies forever. I saw him speak he was, we got to see a movie that he made before the public many years ago. And he was talking about this, he goes, you should all bet on yourself. He goes, it might not work out. But what if it does? He was like, it can work out. And so this idea of betting on yourself is what you've done and it continued to do. So for social media, you are not talking about real estate all that often, unless it's like, I got to really talk about this. It's more about you as a person or is it your personal life or what are you sharing on social? So I actually wrote down right here that I try to do like a balance of, I would say 25% real estate, 75% just hobbies, interesting stuff, things I'm working on. I'm actually, my truck's been in the shop and I've been having two borrow cars and rent cars for two months. I'm on my seventh car this year. And I post enough like that. And it's like people are like, why are you doing this? Or, you know, people reach out. And it's just, it's a touch point that's not about real estate, but it keeps people connected with me. And like, you know, Mason shows I'm a normal person, not just someone who's trying to sell them all the time. And by the way, like being a truck guy, that's a certain, that's a group right there. A truck guys are in their own group and they love other truck guys. By the way, if everyone doesn't know this, I just learned this a few months ago because I bought a car. I had no idea how much trucks were. Like, like, I was like, oh my god, I had no clue that they were that expensive. Now I understand why people love their trucks. They're like a small fortune. But being like that, you know, obviously that's something that you're into has that as any of your hobbies attracted other people who are like minded. I know you're new in your career that might not have happened yet, but I'm curious. Yeah, I actually, I'm a big golfer. I know you said you play tennis. I'm a tennis person as well. I don't play as much as I used to, but I'm a big golfer now. And I've probably met, I would, I would guess 150 to 200 people over the last year just from golf network. And that's like, I'll go play with a friend and they'll bring two friends and just, you know, very organically meet people that way. And it actually has led to business as well. And it's like not really even I'm planning on getting business from it. I just do something that I enjoy with people. And organically those conversations come up and I'm able to generate business that way. I wouldn't say it's a primary driver or anything right now, but it's pretty cool, though. It's pretty cool. Well, you could do something that you enjoy like golf. And it just so happens that in golf, you meet strangers almost every time you play unless you come with a for some, you're going to get put on, you know, with other three other people most most of the time. And what's great about it, it's kind of brilliantly built into the sport is about three to four hours of talking. So there's a lot of time you might be writing in a cart with somebody or walking next to them, hold a hole. You feel can I've been playing golf my whole life as well, not not as into it as I am tennis. But you do feel connected to the stranger by the end. You're sort of like, ah, it's a bummer. I know it's not everyone's super fun, but the people that are you enjoy playing by the end, you feel bonded to them. And it's almost like, ah, I'm not sure you're going to see that guy again or whatever. So it really does lend itself well to real estate because you feel connected to somebody. They feel like they know you by the end of this 18 holes, at least better than if they met you at a cocktail party for five minutes. And there's this like, we just did this thing together. We had this shared experience. We probably had a few laughs or something funny happened during the court during the game. And then again, you know, they're going to need a real turn at some point and maybe just maybe they would choose me. I really think that if anyone out there is thinking about golf, it's probably, again, you can be successful with any activity getting into it. But golf is a really good one because you're just going to meet strangers all the time. And if you love it, you know, you're probably getting a ton of business. So I'm so glad you said that I have had very few people on the show that talk about golf. Maybe it's that real tears are oftentimes just so busy that they don't, you know, once you get to a certain level, you just don't have time. But I'm glad you brought that up because it obviously is working for you too. Let's talk about the trusting the process because I know that is something that can be very frustrating for agents. You know, we all hear this trust the process like, you know, the path to success in real estate has been well defined by lots and lots of different people. You pick sort of your preferred method and you know, you're told to trust. How challenging was it for you to trust that it was going to work out and, you know, how do you handle sort of the ups and downs? That's what I'd like to know. Yeah, I'm fairly impatient. So it's like as soon as I feel like something's not going right or not working, I was either reaching out to people or going to a networking event or something like that. And honestly, you should be a little more consistent with it than I probably was because I would get business and then those activities would die down a little bit and then I would be a little slower than I'd pick those activities back up. And that's a kind of a stressful way to do things to be honest. And it's naturally going to happen in this business. You're not always going to be perfect with your lead generation. But yeah, or I mean, last year, I remember very vividly, October, I was like, where in the world am I going to get business from? And then it's, I know this is cliche, but I went snowboarding in Big Sky in January. And while I was there, I got four houses under contract, which was like, okay, well, so maybe things aren't so bad right now. And, you know, I just I continue to have a good year after that and build on momentum. And honestly, people, you know, as I find more success, people see that more and more. I have more and stuff to post on social media more stuff to talk about. And just kept that rolling from there. But yeah, it's it's very hard early on. If people are starting out doing this, like stick as much money to the side as possible. The only thing I spend money on that's a luxury, I would say, is my golfing activities. Other than that, I'm putting it into marketing stuff or my business or client gifts or, you know, hosting something for friends or something like that. I love that you're investing in your business and you could argue that golf is also to some degree of business expense because certainly there's opportunity there that comes along with it in addition to, you know, the super expensive clubs and course fees and all of that. Yeah, I just I just played with my father. We play once he plays all the time, but I play once a year with him and I'm always shocked at how often or how expensive golfing is. But I will say people who are connected play golf get who tend to have more disposable income because it's expensive sport play golf. So for anyone looking, you know, again, don't play it if you don't want to play it, but if you want to play it, it's not the worst sport. You'll probably get further playing golf with your real estate business than maybe even tennis. I mean, I love tennis, but tennis is a pretty small circle of people and again, you can totally be the tennis agent and that would be awesome too. But I just love, you know, golf just seems to feel that niche. It's just the downside is it's a four hour commitment every time. Right. For some people, they love that and live in that. I wanted to talk about something that really doesn't get enough play, which is sort of going the extra mile. I know there's a story for you in every successful REALTOR has stories like this. But for those of you that are like, hmm, this is how you get people to become a raving fan. So do you mind just sharing the quick story about how you steam cleaned carpets the day of a before a house went live? So this was actually. Yeah, this was, yeah, I guess it was that day of this was my first transaction after going full time and there's a lot of interesting things to say about that transaction. It was a rough day every day of it. But yeah, I mean, I was new. I had time. I probably wouldn't do this now. Actually, I probably still would do it. But the client had we had to get their house like flips and listed within two weeks. Basically, this was an investor and I was not able to get the clean carpet cleaning people out there in time because other contractors didn't get out in time. So I went there. I rented something from a lowest home improvement, went out there at 2 a.m. got it done. It's funny. I videos that stuff too. I hope you videoed that because that's the amazing thing. Yeah, yeah. And I mean, I do that stuff and I don't complain about it. I don't hold it over like people's hands like, oh, well, I did this for you. Like I just do it. And you know, the people appreciate it. That seller was very happy with me by the end of that transaction. It was a very challenging transaction, I will say. So yeah, I mean, he was very happy with me. I do stuff like that. I'll take that extra trip to meet someone. I show up to everything. If clients have events going on, even if a baby shower, which I probably have no business being at, I go like it's small things like that. And that's why I love real estate. There are a lot of smart people in real estate, but you do not have to be the smartest person to do it. It is really a game of effort. Like I'm not saying everyone's going to be the Ryan Sirhan of the world. But if you just put in the effort, you will find a level of success that works for you. I interviewed the top, basically the top team in here in Chicago. And many, many years ago, I interviewed the head of that team. And I said, why do you think you're the most successful team? And he just looked at me dead in the eye and he goes, I work everybody. And I, he goes, I'm not smarter because I'm certainly not smarter. He goes, but I'm willing to work more hours than the average than any other agent. He's like, it's literally the only reason why now, again, work like balance. Yeah, he may be he struggles with that. I don't know. But that's what he told me. And that seems about right. You know, it's just hours. Usually ends up getting creating luck. I think luck is like this, you know, this, you just drill, drill, drill, drill. And eventually things kind of hopefully work out. Yeah. Yeah. And it is, I'm not like the hustle culture person either. I do work hard, but I, I do think people should take time for themselves and take care of themselves and have hoppy say enjoy and have stuff they do just for the fun of doing it. Like I'm going down to Pinehurst, this Saturday to hang out with some friends. But, but on Sunday, I'm going to be available for real estate activities probably every hour of that day. Just, I mean, that's how I prioritize things. Like, you know, I'm going to spend time with friends. I'm going to have hobbies. People always, you know, like when are you working? You're always on the golf course. And it's like, well, if you don't see me on, if you don't see a picture for me on the golf course, I am probably working. So, um, that's just how you play golf. Yeah, you're playing golf. Pinehurst has what like eight courses, nine courses, I forget what they actually might be building their 11th now. I'm actually only playing their part three course on Saturday and we're just hanging out the rest of the day. But see, that's a fun one. That's, I mean, I haven't played it. But I love part three course. Anyway, we're talking golf and probably most of us are like shut up about golf. I love that. But again, you're right. Yeah, having, and I think work life balance is everything. Yes, you're going to work probably more hours as a REALTOR than you would a traditional nine to five. You just are. It's just the way of the world. And the rewards are going to be much better. And you should still be mindful of your work life balance. So I love that you are not getting sucked into the whole, the hustle culture because yes, it can work, but at what cost, right? So it's like one of those things that, yep, yeah, you can work 18 hours a day if you really want to. And then, you know, you'll just have to be mindful of how does that affect my health? How does it affect my energy? And how, you know, and so I love that you've taken that into effect. I have a question for you because you've, you're still new to the business. But if you could go knowing everything you know now, or let's say the different way, a brand new agent comes to you and says, wow, you had a great first year. What would you do if you were me starting out right now? Just curious. So like, think about maybe what you did and maybe you would have even modified how you got started. So I'm curious what you would do differently or what you would say to somebody if they were starting out. So I would say the first thing you should do is get in touch with every person in your network. I people get distracted by, you know, I'm the first person to say do social media, but people get distracted by social media and online leads and all that kind of fancy stuff that is sold in the real estate world. In my, in my mind, I was like, if the people I know already aren't going to use me, then I'm not going to be that successful this probably. And they're the easiest people to sell right now. I don't even have to sell them. So I should reach out to them first. And I will say I was like fortunate to have a pretty good network already. So that might not be as easy for someone that's traveling or moving to a new city or something like that. But even then, like, you could go to one networking event a week that it doesn't have to be real estate related. It can be just a hobby you enjoy. And you would probably get two to three deals if you did that every week for a year. 100%. I mean, even just joining like the Chamber of Commerce and going and doing the events of like they're opening the new whatever Starbucks. So we're going to go, you know, be there at the celebration, like even stuff like that, not real estate stuff necessarily is really a fun way to get involved and just meet a bunch of fun people. Yeah. And there's probably a day that there's not a day that goes by that I don't text a friend or someone about, hey, let's go grab lunch next week. And it's not like I have an intention to get anything out of that. I just want to go see them and see how things are going that because maybe I'm lucky. I enjoy being in front of people. I don't enjoy the back-end stuff of this job. It is just tedious work that keeps me up till 11 o'clock a night every night. But I do enjoy being with people like yesterday. I was in that event. Very random. It was a bunch of guys that we kind of know each other on Twitter. We met at Raleigh Beard Garden here. And none of us had ever met before and you know, made a lot of great connections in person and put some faces to the avatars. And it was awesome. I mean, yeah, it can be that simple. I don't even really talk about real estate that much as I said. Just do stuff you enjoy. I think when you connect with people and you demonstrate that you care about them and that you're interested in their lives, then there's this reciprocity that just sort of naturally occurs where they feel more connected to you. And of course, when they have those needs, you don't have to tell them you're a financial advisor and insurance agent or a real estate agent or an attorney. They know what they know more than that is. Wow. This guy checks in on me once in a while. He cares about me, asks me how I'm doing, takes me to lunch. The good news is too. I love that. I think it was Scott Peck wrote this book, but you don't have to read the book. But the title says it all. It's not crowded along the extra mile. Like it just isn't. I'd love it. It can be a little lonely on the extra mile because you'd be like, wow, nobody else is maybe not as many people are doing it going the extra mile. But it is certainly a road to success. And I love that that you are taking time out every day to just check in with somebody see how they're doing. And then when they need you, they will find you. That's kind of the brilliance of it. And now it's one thing I would add to that. If you're someone that needs structure behind that that first week, just trying to reach out to 20 people. I mean, text 20 people. It doesn't have to be call. It doesn't have to be a DM. I just text 20 people, you know, and see what's up and see if they want to grab lunch on a free day coming up. And I even have a little, a little script I could say. So for anyone who's like, I feel a little nervous. I feel a little contrived. Here's what here's an easy way to sort of this is just, I was taught this is not my idea is call of and this actually applies to a different industry. But I think it applies perfectly to real estate. Call up a friend and say, hey, you know, I've started this new career. I would love to get your advice about something. I'm just working on my marketing plan. And I just wanted to ask your opinion, just make sure I'm on the right track. Can I take you to lunch? You know, I just need a few minutes, you know, I'll take you to, you know, grab a coffee or whatever. I'll meet you at your office. And then you could go down and say, okay, hey, I really want to get your thoughts. This is kind of how I wanted to brand myself. Like you could even bring to the other person some, you know, something that you might ask their opinion on because it's like the most flattering thing in the world to ask somebody's opinion about something. And therefore, you're not going, so do you need a REALTOR right now? Like you don't even have to do like, hey, I just wanted to like check it. You know me pretty well. I wanted to see. Do you think this feels like me? You know, and you could just ask them that. And it's so I, if anyone out there is a little nervous to contact people they know, do it that way. Be like, I was wondering if I could get your advice. And then you could say, hey, I really want to meet more people like you, like you be my ideal client. So if you were me, how would I find more people like you? Do you know, as you're like that? And then people will say, oh, we have a trade organization party that we do every or, you know, or come talk to my office. We have tons of people that need REALTORS and maybe bring lunch or something, you know, opportunities emerge sometimes. And does that happen from from sometimes these conversations that you have with people that even though it's not a real estate necessarily conversation, it ends up being an opportunity. 100% like so when I was in grad school, I had a good friend. I took some classes with and he moved on to West Hanson to be a teacher at a college up there like a notch for the internship program. And I just, I don't know why, but I had just randomly reached out to him one day just to see how things were going. We chatted and a week later he texted me like, hey, actually my buddy and Raleigh is, I was friends with him because we're car guys. And he's saying about selling his house and he doesn't have the fondest opinion of real estate agents and you're probably, and I don't either. And he was like, you're probably the only person that I would recommend to him. And I literally got a listing out of that this February, out of the blue, unexpected, was not reaching out for any particular reason other than I just like the guy and want to see what is up to him because he's interesting. And I mean, it worked out that way. And literally you meet one person, they might introduce you to that next person. That's the person that changes your business or changes your life. It might not even be your best friend. It might be the person they introduce you to. Yeah, so I mean, don't be scared to put yourself out there. And I will say early on you're going to be inefficient at everything. It's going to feel like a grind. You're going to be like, what do I have to talk about? I haven't even done anything yet. It still feels like that for me. It's like, you know, I'm lucky to have a great start, but there's someone this year who has sold 30x more real estate than I have. So, you know, there's levels to this for everyone. I wanted to bring up something that is very impressive to me about your business as sort of new-ish as it is, is that you are also getting calls from other agents who say, hey, I don't really hyper focus in the area that Ryan's, but, right, you specialize in. So I have this client. Maybe you can handle him. I'll take a referral fee, but I want you to handle it because you're going to do a better job. That doesn't happen to 30 year olds. And it is happening to you. I want to talk about how, how are you playing nice in the sandbox with other agents or playing so nice in the box that they're like, I'm going to send my referrals to this guy because that is a very impressive tell about how well you're doing is if other agents are like, this is the guy, that's a very nice confidence booster. But can you talk us through a little bit about how that works? Yeah. So, maybe I can get a little specific on that. Like, the triangle's a pretty big market and top to bottom, or east of west, you're probably driving an hour and a half to two hours and a lot of cases. So it's like that agent on the outskirts might not want to do business in that other shot of town. But I just, I like, I've networked a lot through social media with other agents in the area and then just organically met them through other events or met them actually on bigger pockets, forums or stuff like that. And I had a, even this past week, I had a buddy who was in St. Andrew's golfing and he was like, Hey, I, he's, I just client, they're really interested in these three homes. They want to see him this week because they're moving down from Massachusetts. I obviously can't help them right now. Do you think you could, you could help them? It's actually better fit for your area anyways. And I was like, of course, so it's really just being present. I, you know, answered quickly. I know the guy will. We talk about investing quite a bit. So it's, I mean, just being trustworthy that you're going to take care of people you're going to do the right thing by someone that they care about. And it's in a day like if he can have those clients back on the next transaction, I'm not a petty or a gatekeeping person. Yeah, I'm going to serve them very well. If they want to work with me again, the future five, they want to work with him fine, but it is like that is a great feeling for me because it shows that, you know, other people believe in me. Yeah, it's the greatest compliment because again, that agent, you know, it's their client or someone that was referred to them and they don't want the reputation tarnished by giving that lead over to somebody who maybe doesn't do a great job. And so to put that faith in a younger agent who's, you know, it really is a real testament to how, how a professional you are with your, with your clients. And I wanted to also ask a little bit about the changes that are happening with the NAR settlement. And I'm not interested in, you know, talking about sort of what agents think about it because we all have our opinions. But have you as a new agent, you're like thrown right in the middle of this and you saw how it, of course, how it used to be and now you're seeing how it's changing. Are you concerned, nervous, do you feel prepared? You know, we're two days at the time of us recording this, we are two days away from the changes going into effect, which basically changes, you know, possible compensation. It's decoupled. We now, you know, have to sort of secure our own, our own buyer side, possibly a commission. So I'm just curious on, you know, if you're feeling nervous about that or if you feel prepared, you know, how are you doing? Yeah, I mean, I think a lot of people will tell you they're not concerned. I had actually, I am a, change is concerning for me because things could happen overnight. They could happen in six months that really change like the fabric of this business and what I'm doing. And it's funny, like, of course, this happens. I'm flush with more buyers than I've ever had in my life. And so I'm having to have those interesting conversations repeatedly. But honestly, I'm just building that skill set. And I, you know, I'm telling my buyers like, hey, I'm trying to get my commission paid for either by the seller or through a closing credit. But, you know, this is the situation if I'm not able to do that. And to be honest, like I will say, if we get to a situation where my commission is the difference between them, not getting or not getting a house will negotiate it. Like that's fine. It will always negotiate it anyways. But, yeah, I'm not concerned about the messaging. I am concerned about the actual business changing. Because I think over time, you could see commissions change. And will it be worth it to work with buyers in the same process that we have in the past? I don't know because it could make going that extra mile a little harder. Yeah. Yeah, it could make it just inefficient enough or unprofitable enough to drive agents away from buyer representation. Or we, you know, as an industry do such a good job of educating buyers that the transition is a little bit, you know, more smooth. But it's certainly going to be uncomfortable here. And yeah, I was going to say, like, people are going to want some type of representation. So there is value there. There is money to be made for agents there. That might change. Like, maybe people all for more of a limited service in the future that, you know, maybe they're doing more like contract review and negotiation, scheduling, all that stuff. I could definitely see a world where it's easier for a buyer to get into a house without an agent. Obviously that a lot would have to change in between now and that happening. But I could see a world where that happens or it becomes a thing. So the business model could just change. There's always real estate is one of the biggest industries in the world. If not the biggest, there's always going to be opportunity within it. And like the people who are top producers and successful say they're not worried because they'll just adapt to it. That is the best lesson. I think I could I couldn't have said it better myself because I will tell you after interviewing hundreds and hundreds of top one percenters and agents in the country, some of the very, very top of the mountain people and asking them this question. Some of them got asked this question too. Not one of them was concerned. And it wasn't because, oh, my clients will just pay for it. I'm not worried about it. That wasn't the reason why they said I've adapted. I know how to present this. I know my numbers. I've practiced my pitch. And if it, you know, I'll find out how it works. And and a lot of them had been doing it anyway. A lot of buyers agents had been doing this for years. I had no idea. I did not know other agents were actually doing buyer representation and talking about commissions saying you might come out of pocket for this. I met an agent who's been doing it for eight years, a very successful agent. I was like, did you ever get pushback? He goes never once. He goes, now I explained it. He goes, so when this change is coming, he's like, it's not a change for me. And he goes, I go, have anyone ever had to pay out of pocket a buyer? He goes, happens all the time. I go, really? Do you get pushback? Not once. And I go, that's, that's all I ever need to hear. Because now I'm not, now I know the model works. And of course, lots of people have done this. But again, I think you're right. It's about pivoting. And it's about not focusing on, you know, it's that old, is it the prayer of Saint Francis? I'm not a Catholic guy, but I think it's the peristate Francis, but it's like, or not maybe not per, anyway, whatever it's the, oh, no, no, it's a serenity prayer. Sorry, serenity, I'm not a, I'm not a Catholic. So I don't, I did go to Catholic school, but I'm not Catholic. But it was, you know, you can only change what you can change essentially. It's what the prayer says is don't focus on what you can't change because you're basically just throwing your fist into a wall. And that's exactly right. Because if we adapt, there's always opportunity. It's, you know, it's, it's, it's like, you don't, you know, it's the same sort of opportunity comes in the most, in opportune times too. Like, yeah, you know, if you're in the market and you're buying securities, stocks and bonds and things, you know, you want to go, you want to buy them at the low. You don't want to buy them when things are good because obviously, for obvious reasons, but it doesn't feel good to buy something when it's, when it's, you know, depressed. So getting over some of those, so the pivoting doesn't have to feel good. It probably won't feel good. In fact, if it does feel good, you're probably not pivoting correctly. It probably should feel a little like, I mean, I don't know if this is going to work, but you're just going to do it anyway. And you're going to get the result. But like you were saying, nobody, oh, well, you and I don't like change. I don't like change either. It's scary to me. I like routine. I like the same. And yet, I'm in an industry that changes all the time. So I appreciate that. One last question for you is, what are the skills you're currently working on that? Because, you know, you're still new to the business. What are, what would you like to get better at? I would like to be, well, I have actually a couple of items I would like to focus on moving forward here. I would like to get better at more targeted direct mail. So intertwining my hobby and job, I would actually like to become almost like the North Carolina, like golf course expert. And like, kind of tie that into real estate as well and kind of like focus a lot of my marketing towards those types of neighborhoods and understanding them, understanding not just like the neighborhood, but the golf experience there and what it has to offer. So I'd like to focus more on that. And that in itself could be almost a separate business down the line. That is it. I'm putting my, I'm always wearing a marketing hack because that's my background. I've never heard of anybody doing this. And it's such a brilliant idea because golfers care about this kind of thing. Golfers want to live near golf courses. They want to know how easy it is to get in. They want to understand the course experience. And you live in an area with lots of golf courses. So it's not like we only have five courses knowing everybody knows them. No, there's probably a hundred courses, you know, within, within several hours of you. And you could be the guy making the YouTube videos of I'm the real estate agent that's going to show you what it's like to play golf in this neighborhood and consider maybe even moving to this neighborhood. Here's the experience of living there playing or whatever. Oh, I could see that as a, I could see that as this own YouTube channel. Yeah, I had a moment one day while I was playing and I saw an advertisement for a real estate agent in that neighborhood. And not to be agist or sex or anything here, but it was a rather old lady who had like asked the agent for that golfing neighborhood. I'm like, the people that live here probably don't resonate with her and, you know, as much as they might with me, especially if it's a younger crowd there. So like I was like, maybe there's an opportunity there to start doing more direct focus advertising these neighborhoods. And then also just playing nine holes and videoing it and posting it up on my YouTube or social media and be like, and have a real understanding of the golf course and what holes are great to live on, what holes are you do want to stay away from like stuff like that. Yeah. And also to like what to play next, right? Like all of us are always like, hey, what's the next best course that I've never heard of. But you are, cool. I see a huge opportunity there. I fully expect in a year you'll have this sort of YouTube channel with all of these golf, either living in a golf community and sort of knowing the figuring that out or just, hey, golfers, I'm the real estate golfer. I'm going to show you the, you know, the best courses in the area and we're going to walk them together and I'm going to do the, you know, I so much opportunity. And I want to love watching stuff like that. One other thing I recognized is it's very hard to find data for the different neighborhoods and like what they have to offer. So I was like, I could put together a list of like the 50 private courses and the triangle of North Carolina, what initiation fees, what dues there are, like what amenities each of those neighbors have, who it, you know, what's the median price point in that neighborhood and almost do like a, probably like a Facebook ad or Google ad for that marketing material and collect email addresses that way. That's an idea, you know, it's a little work or not, but it's worth trying in my opinion. I love it. And again, we're listening to Ryan's creative process right now. And so I love that you're sharing that with our audience because you're having success. These are the kind of thoughts that that we want to have is how do I, how do I marry together something that's really interesting to me in a way that's useful to people in the community. And if you can do those two things and then put content out that specifically addresses, here's, you know, how to address these questions or concerns about people who are into this hobby and also maybe are in this particular community. You know, you're gonna, you're gonna, people search on YouTube for questions to answer and that, you know, could be is, hey, I'm thinking I'm joining a private club. What are the initiation costs? I would, you know, yes, of course, because golfers too, anytime there's a private course, they're like, I wonder what it costs to join this club. Yeah, like that's, that's a thought every golfer has had whenever they're playing a private course. You're like, this is pretty nice. I wonder what, what the costs. And, you know, it's not easy to get that information unless you ask somebody who's a member there and they might not even know. But, um, but yeah, how long does it take to become a member? That's another thing too. Like, my sister lives on a course in Florida where it's a 10 year weight period if she wants to do it. It's crazy. Just insane. It's crazy. It's, it's crazy. But she only knew that because she called them and said, how long is the weightless? Anyway, Ryan, you are doing some really great things. I hope to continue to follow you and watch your, your success as you continue to do more and more production. I want to thank Ryan on behalf of our audience for, you know, coming on, spending some time. I know you don't have a ton of time, but you spend it with us today. I appreciate that. Let's follow Ryan on Instagram. Cash rules Raleigh. So we're going to have a link to that in the show notes and also right over cash. You can find him on Facebook. He, by the way, he's the REALTOR that agents in his market are sending referrals over. So if you are outside of that market, the, you know, or inside the market and you're looking for an agent to refer business to, obviously he's doing something right. So he might be a great connection point for you, our listener. And by the way, people move out of Raleigh Durham as well. And they go south sometimes and maybe when they're retiring, although it's a pretty, you don't have to go too far south when you're in North Carolina. It's pretty beautiful everywhere. But they people move out. So Ryan needs people agents to refer to as well. So connect with him. Let him know you appreciated him being on the show. And let's follow him on Instagram. Because I, if I was an agent practicing right now, I just kind of take notes from what Ryan's doing on social media and probably do the same thing. So check out what Ryan's doing. Reach out to him on behalf of Ryan and myself. We want to thank the audience for sticking around to the end. We appreciate you guys the best. And thank you. We are podcast no joke. This is the absolute truth has had its most successful month ever last month. And this month where I'm paced to do it. This after seven years, we could not be happier that everyone seems to still enjoy the show. And please tell us how we can improve the show because we can always do better as well. Also, tell a friend about the show. Leave us a review. Let us know what you think. And if there's an agent in your local market that you're like, I want to know what that person's doing. Let us know who that person is. We will, we will get them on the show. So Ryan, thank you so, so much. Appreciate you. And love to see your star rising. And we'll continue to watch it rise. And we'll also continue to watch you pivot as things change. So let's keep our eye on Ryan and send him some business. If you have people in that area and also, you know, he might be sending you business too. So Ryan, thank you so much. And we will see everybody on the next episode. Thanks, DJ.
