[00:03:17] All right. Today on this show, we have team leader coach, author, broker, business owner, and
[00:03:26] forward thinker, Mitch, Mitch Rebek. And I want to tell you more about Mitch. He has this really
[00:03:32] long and impressive career. We're going to be really learning from a lot of his wisdom today. But
[00:03:37] Mitch has been an entrepreneur since the age of 19. And check this out. This is incredible. He's
[00:03:42] owned 23 different businesses in 18 different industries. He was the first online dating service
[00:03:48] and the third paintball business in the US. Now over the years, he's been in the restaurant
[00:03:53] business, flowers, advertising, marketing, call centers, and now real estate among many other
[00:03:59] industries. Currently, Rich Mitch runs tropical beach sidebroker by EXPs in Florida with over 150
[00:04:06] agents in Brevard County, Florida, and a total number of agents of 2,000 across the United States.
[00:04:14] Oh, actually, beyond the United States, not just the United States in seven countries,
[00:04:17] including the United States, almost as agents and almost every one of the US states,
[00:04:22] missing one. I'm curious which one he doesn't have. We'll have to see one of our listeners maybe
[00:04:26] can sign up with them and then he can get the full 50. But TRB, his company tropical beach sidebroker
[00:04:33] is been in the top 10 real estate brokerages since the opening the doors in 20 2005 tropical beach
[00:04:41] sidebrealt. He averages 800 plus transactions per year. That is impressive. Mitch became a REALTOR
[00:04:47] in 2001, quickly became successful through multiple avenues, including open houses and the internet.
[00:04:53] In 2008, Mitch published his first book, 100 mile per hour marketing for real estate
[00:04:58] and it quickly shot to number one in real estate books. In 2015, Mitch's second book, so you have
[00:05:04] your real estate license now. What is selling extremely well throughout North America. Mitch has a new
[00:05:09] book called The Big Lie, which we are going to talk about today as well. Mitch currently speaks
[00:05:14] throughout North America on a variety of subjects, including internet marketing and lead conversion
[00:05:18] inside sales agents, mindset, open houses, sphere of influence, expectations, and how to kick off
[00:05:24] your career in real estate among other subjects. Mitch currently lives in Merritt Island, Florida
[00:05:29] with his wife, Jeanette. They have four grown children and for beautiful grandchildren, Lola,
[00:05:33] Henry, Cash and Logan. I want everybody to check out Mitch's website, which is Mitch
[00:05:40] Rebek.com. That's R-I-B-A-K. We'll have a link to that in the show notes. We will also have a link
[00:05:45] to all of Mitch's books and also everything Mitch related with social media as well. So check that
[00:05:51] out. Mitch, welcome to the show. Hey, thanks for having me. I appreciate it. Very excited to
[00:05:56] talk about it. I sound the most important there. It's crazy. Well, you are an important person,
[00:06:02] and I'm excited that I always find that the most important people, for the most part, tend to be
[00:06:07] the most humble as well. So we're glad to have you on the show. Tell us, gosh, you've done so many
[00:06:12] things, and you've done things before real estate. I know you've done things after you're still in
[00:06:17] real estate, and you're also owning businesses outside of real estate. But tell us like how and
[00:06:21] why did you get into real estate? Desperation broke. So like you said, I was the first online
[00:06:28] dating service, which was a lot of fun. I had a at asquitch.com, which is my advice column. I had
[00:06:36] a asquitch to date Dr. Radio Show on 45 radio stations. Six million people a month can be
[00:06:41] going to our sites. And then the contract for ridiculous amount of money because that's what we
[00:06:46] did back in the the.com boom right? Sure. And too much before we were supposed to close, now as
[00:06:51] you tired you have 40 years old, the in-appable burst and started by $82 million and I lost.
[00:06:56] I was a bad couple days. And still ran the business until we ran out of money, but after that
[00:07:02] there was no more raising money in the internet. And so my buddy Joe was a developer from
[00:07:08] the boss. He's like, Mitch, get your real estate license. I'm like, no, I don't like REALTORS. Why
[00:07:11] would I do that? He'd be good at it. I don't want to do that. I literally had three months with a
[00:07:16] remedy left. So I got my real estate license and honestly, it's probably the easiest thing I've
[00:07:22] ever done besides paintball. Meaning I sold 36 homes in my first year, 50, my second, 80, my
[00:07:30] third and fourth years since that my team and I started my brokerage. And I don't understand
[00:07:35] not selling homes because I find it very simple. So we can have some conversations about that,
[00:07:41] but ultimately it's what you get this because you get what you put into it, right?
[00:07:46] Yeah. I think it's a very fair business in that sense where if you're willing to put in the
[00:07:51] effort, I think the path to success, well there's many paths to success as a real estate agent,
[00:07:57] but those paths have been well-trot and they are well-defined. You can read books. You can watch
[00:08:02] YouTube videos. You can hire coaches. You can join a brokerage that will assist you. It can be
[00:08:07] done. And it can be done whether you brand new to a city and you just moved and you have no
[00:08:12] sphere of influence or you live there your whole life. I am curious for you when you say it's the easiest
[00:08:17] part that the easiest thing you've done, why do you think you found it so doable? Well, I have
[00:08:24] a suspicion of why you found it easier than maybe other people would find it. And I suspect,
[00:08:29] and I want you to correct me if I'm wrong, but I suspect it's because you understand how to run
[00:08:34] businesses. Yeah, well, I'm an entrepreneur. So yeah, I walked in my first day of the brokerage
[00:08:39] and my broker the time said, just so you know, I don't do any training at all, but all the
[00:08:44] things follow up follow up follow up, which by the way, it was a blessing. So on day one, I wrote my
[00:08:50] business plan. I didn't know anything different. I didn't know real estate's don't write business plans.
[00:08:54] So day one, I wrote my business plan. Day two is 9-11. So we kind of stopped that thing. Sure.
[00:09:00] Really bad of ADDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
[00:09:04] candy and dinity. So I knew my weaknesses was going to be contracts. So I wrote 30 fake contracts in
[00:09:10] x-3 days 10 each day. And then I did my first open house on that Saturday. And I just talked to
[00:09:16] people what a concept. I didn't have a state of influence because the only person I knew is my
[00:09:21] girlfriend who's now my wife and her mother and she lived with me. She wasn't by any way. So I
[00:09:27] I knew I had a generate needs because every business in the world has the same sales cycle generate needs their true needs
[00:09:32] Close the lead and create a customer for life. I don't care what product you sell it's the same. That's that's that's the cycle for sure
[00:09:37] So I knew all this stuff going in so I had a little advantage over your average person who was a teacher or a bartender or whatever they did prior
[00:09:45] But I knew I had a generate needs I knew I didn't know anybody everybody told me don't do open house and don't do internet
[00:09:53] 2001 so open houses like said if you're told me not to do that but people are coming to me. How can that be a bad thing?
[00:09:59] I'm getting leads
[00:10:00] Yeah, and the same thing with internet my background was internet being the first online dating service. So why would I not do that?
[00:10:07] So I did I went my first contract from five days in and I
[00:10:11] Started in September that January had nine closings
[00:10:14] Wow, and so one of the things I learned and I started this from day one not knowing to do this
[00:10:19] But my January first is actually November first
[00:10:23] And what I've learned is during November, December almost every real trade no quiz
[00:10:27] They they hit their they go into hibernation
[00:10:30] Well, they they hit their goal and they're stopped. I'm gonna take a break
[00:10:34] Well, they did hit their goal. They won't hit it so they take a break
[00:10:37] They take a break and it's and it's a holiday that I learned why not excel during November December
[00:10:42] So I start off with a massive amount of sales and so I started by you going strong
[00:10:47] So I didn't have any
[00:10:48] Like if you build a really good system, you don't have mountains. I had two months of my entire selling career where I didn't have sales
[00:10:57] It's incredible because you were always focused on lead gen and nurturing and follow up and that can be done
[00:11:04] Really any day of the year no matter what's happening
[00:11:07] Yeah, maybe you know, obviously 9-11 probably wouldn't have been the right day
[00:11:11] But aside from a major catastrophe like that any day of the day of the year
[00:11:16] You can prospect whether it's you know, and again holidays excluded maybe but you can even do it
[00:11:21] Maybe on the holidays, but but certainly it you're right. We have agents. They shut down
[00:11:25] They tend to shut down at the later part of the year
[00:11:28] You know, there's not as much activity which is what what they'll say there's not as many buyers not as many sellers people aren't as motivated and
[00:11:35] Yet the people I know who are the most successful don't stop they really it's just like okay
[00:11:42] They just pivot and they just do different things between you know, November and December and yeah and and the rest of us
[00:11:49] It's really a great time to pick up market share
[00:11:51] I think because so many agents are are gonna take it easy. Yeah, well, that's what they do
[00:11:56] They you know, it's kind of
[00:11:59] These are what the part of the big lie. It's kind of what we're talking. It's really slow in November December
[00:12:04] So actually you rebuild your systems and get all this stuff going and of course then you start working in January
[00:12:09] You have your first contract late January February you'll be first picked it to late February
[00:12:14] My I was like it is a brokerage. I was the central bank of REALTORS for every every January in February because that my wealth is work
[00:12:23] And then it's never a five grand
[00:12:25] I can't get my mortgage and
[00:12:28] Yeah, you know, and this really leads us into what I think you know again
[00:12:34] You're obviously a skilled salesperson and I don't I don't I know that can even be sort of seen as a negative
[00:12:40] Caution these days because we think sometimes salespeople are are not you know, maybe not the most
[00:12:46] You know good feeling people that that that we when we think about it
[00:12:50] But Mitch is really what he is is a great visit a great entrepreneur and a great lead generator and I heard Brian
[00:12:58] I think it was Brian Tracy said many many years ago in a
[00:13:01] 20 years ago I heard him in a conference and he said just so you know for all your business owners
[00:13:06] prospecting solves all problems and
[00:13:09] And you know and of course that's not absolutely true
[00:13:11] But it's pretty close to absolutely true because if you have you know, you could be a terrible REALTOR
[00:13:17] You could never improve your skills and if all you did was double the number of prospects that you have in your database
[00:13:24] You will double your business just I mean
[00:13:26] Assuming assuming you would and that's a pretty interesting thing so you don't of course you want to improve your skills as well
[00:13:34] But if you just double your double your prospecting you should double your income
[00:13:37] Well, here's what I've realized a few years
[00:13:40] There's one common alley for every business that I've owned
[00:13:43] It is building the foundation and what's the foundation? It's who's my customer where are they? Yeah, every business ever brought and
[00:13:50] I didn't have that blessing here because I did know he looks at my girlfriend
[00:13:54] But this most of the world is I need within trade they have more contacts in their cell phone
[00:13:59] Then they'll ever need the rest of their life
[00:14:02] Couldn't I could not agree with you more and I want to I want to just say this
[00:14:06] In case it just slipped by and and people didn't hear it what Mitch just said is in Mitch has two thousand agents
[00:14:12] So this is not something he's not just like well just works for Mitch
[00:14:15] No, no, Mitch is this is what Mitch teaches everybody. It's the reason why he's been so successful
[00:14:20] Everybody listening right now has more contacts in their database
[00:14:25] Then then they probably need because a certain percentage of those people are going to transact in real estate
[00:14:30] Every single year and you wouldn't of course be the person they think about
[00:14:34] Yeah, and the numbers actually seven out of a hundred
[00:14:37] So we know the number that's been around for a lot of you know, it's been around for a lot of years
[00:14:40] They actually say a lot of I like to say I like to set expectations low sure but but the reality is so I'll give you the except
[00:14:46] I have two thousand contacts in my phone
[00:14:49] I really create to a hundred and forty sales this year
[00:14:52] Now you have to go back and say why does someone use you as a REALTOR
[00:14:56] And there's only one reason
[00:14:58] Right, so I'll ask that I did a class of about a thousand people recently and I asked that not one person got it right
[00:15:04] The only week
[00:15:05] Can I guess yeah, okay, my guess is the reason why they chose you is they trust you
[00:15:14] See I'm wrong, okay, tell me why they chose you they only use you because you happen to be in front of them
[00:15:19] That they keep on buying or selling you know what that is absolutely true
[00:15:23] That's it
[00:15:24] I stopped selling a few years ago. I really got to look at the business completely different
[00:15:30] Now I have I've always was working in the I was just as guilty. That's where I get my book
[00:15:34] But where he in the business not on the business and when I step back three years ago from selling
[00:15:39] Um, and by the way, I was always in front of my people twice a month and I would get 40 to 80 calls every year
[00:15:46] To sell home now. I didn't sell that because I didn't want to right but I got that money
[00:15:50] The day I stopped which is October 2021 the next year. I got six phone calls
[00:15:56] This year I've got three
[00:15:59] Because I stopped doing it. I don't want to stop it anymore now
[00:16:03] I might go back and build a referral company for the front of it because I'm an entrepreneur and I have to do stuff
[00:16:08] But um, but the reality is that's the reason so once you know that
[00:16:11] Then you have to sign to think me
[00:16:13] That's made up for it by the way you have to figure out what's the right response. We've tested all this the years now
[00:16:19] We've learned if you said once a once a week. It's too much
[00:16:22] Yeah, if you said once a month or so. I'm not that's when we came up with the every other week
[00:16:27] Yeah, it's if you are dripping on people every other week and I imagine does this include all forms of communication
[00:16:34] This could be email text
[00:16:36] So that's just email just email so emailing every two weeks with something of value
[00:16:42] So there's only two things you only two things you said to him. This is so simple my way. I love it
[00:16:46] The first email that goes out is the market update because it's different every month and people will look at it
[00:16:51] Most of us will send these newsletters if nobody cares about right that's true
[00:16:55] Yeah, do you read newsletters if you want to say do you read them easily? I did a presentation once called nobody wants to read your newsletter
[00:17:02] That's right. So the first one is that and then the second one two weeks later to top 10 things out is my top 10 things to do in the market
[00:17:10] Okay, this is a brilliant thing so I'm here in Chicago Mitch. I apologize
[00:17:14] I don't when you steal your thunder, but Mitch is so absolutely dead on I have a friend Nicole
[00:17:19] She's I wish she was one of our brokers. She isn't but she's a friend of mine here in Chicago. We have 47,000 agents in the in the area
[00:17:26] She's the oh, I'm sure there's a few others that do it
[00:17:29] But the only one I know and I know I know a lot of those agents the only one that does
[00:17:33] Top she does top five things to do this weekend in the city of Chicago in the suburbs kind of you know
[00:17:39] And I look forward to it every week because I actually plan my weekends with it
[00:17:44] So this is such a brilliant idea. I'm so glad you do that
[00:17:47] So last last agent I talked to do this at her first four months got six or six and four miles
[00:17:52] out of a database of only 400
[00:17:55] Wow
[00:17:55] Yeah, so so again goes back to building your foundation which unfortunately most brokers don't know that either
[00:18:03] Right and nothing gets broken. So it's just that one of the lot of companies you learn by losing millions of millions of millions of dollars
[00:18:08] How to be good? Yeah, well, you have to be willing to fail too, right? You have to be willing to try things and and you know
[00:18:15] And again, it's not really a failure, but not getting the the result that you wanted and then going okay
[00:18:20] How do I you know it's only way we learn is through through mistakes, right?
[00:18:23] And testing is really important so when I started out again being with the optional backup
[00:18:29] I didn't do things for a week until I didn't work my minimum test was six months
[00:18:34] Yeah, everything is when I'm mastered open houses and I never so less than 24 homes in a year from open houses
[00:18:39] Always between 24 and 30 homes
[00:18:42] I just mastered it and I keep up with different things like oh if I do this this will happen
[00:18:47] What if than this right
[00:18:49] And it came really simple and became a lot of things so the blessing of not being any trading everything that I
[00:18:54] I developed I developed like internet leak a version when I was the first person doing
[00:18:59] post registration in January 2002 I started my first website and nobody was doing post registration
[00:19:06] Right. Yeah, we was right. That's true. I had so many REALTORS yell at me. I can't believe you make people register on your site
[00:19:13] I'm like I can't believe you don't yeah
[00:19:15] Right, this is we want their information. So they said well, I said 50% of the people are registering
[00:19:22] They're like what about the other 85% I like want about yeah, I'll go some
[00:19:29] So it's just thinking differently so that was you know when I looked back at my business over the last year
[00:19:35] The last 23 years. I mean the business the thing at the common thing I think the people that we see is successful in our business
[00:19:42] Our successful selling homes, but they're not successful in business
[00:19:47] Yeah, there's a lot of top producers that I suspect they don't often share this although some of them have shared this even on this show
[00:19:55] Is that they could have the highest production year
[00:19:58] Uh, ever maybe it's selling 80 homes or more and they're like I didn't make any money and and that's shocking
[00:20:05] But it's something to think about because maybe they're overspending or they're not managing the finances whatever
[00:20:11] Well, they're not money and business, but you know, I said earlier you know, we're talking before the show is you know most people don't look happy job
[00:20:19] Now they might they might own their copy job
[00:20:21] And well, that's not just real, so it's everybody I know every call business that doesn't really want to business
[00:20:26] They have a copy job right and they get and they get better at finding what I tell them. That's just reality
[00:20:31] So to be when I look back at my friends at a sling 80 homes when I was selling 80 homes here
[00:20:34] I mean I had a copy job for the 80 100 hours week
[00:20:37] And I wasn't making good money couple two 300 thousand dollars a year
[00:20:42] But the reality is I had my life
[00:20:44] You know, no it's all okay to fruition when I turned 60 and I look back at my life
[00:20:49] I said
[00:20:50] Could we do that with every 10 years of your life right and I look back and say I cannot tell you five things to take you with my kids
[00:20:56] When they're growing up and that hurts sure and there's a lot of you out there right now that are in your 30s and 40s or 20s
[00:21:03] They have little kids that's your most important job
[00:21:08] Right your businesses your business if you run a business, but you're most important job is not to do it. I did
[00:21:13] That's why I preach it's why I broke the book
[00:21:15] I wrote this book in 90 days my last two books took me two years each
[00:21:20] I didn't 90 days because I blocked out four hours a day to write
[00:21:23] So I can make sure I give this book out because I didn't post on social media just talking about that
[00:21:29] About how most people build copy jobs and I got two hundred and sixty two responses
[00:21:35] Wow and and everybody was in pain
[00:21:38] And so people say Mitch what are you teaching now?
[00:21:41] I mean I can teach all this stuff to sell houses
[00:21:42] But really when I teach this teach how to get freedom
[00:21:46] Yeah, let's talk about that. So the book is the big lie
[00:21:50] Let's let's tell us what is the big lie?
[00:21:53] It's the big lie sell a lot of homes and you'll be successful and once you do that start a team
[00:21:58] Yeah, they don't tell you gonna start a big city job
[00:22:00] And then because you need to get more split because you're not making money as a team you started brokerage
[00:22:07] Right and it's all ego based
[00:22:10] Like I know so many of my friends why I adore who will not listen to me because I'm the guy
[00:22:16] And by my own my brokerage with the 120 agents, you know
[00:22:20] I was the guy. It's really feels good, right?
[00:22:23] That doesn't pay your bills. It feels good
[00:22:25] Sure, so I see these guys don't give it in simple one of my friends. He does about eight go hundred homes every year
[00:22:30] Uh, he works at least a hundred hours a week
[00:22:33] And there's a reason why there's a hamster on the cover of my book
[00:22:36] uh, and
[00:22:38] I said why are you doing that? How many people are you doing the their buyers?
[00:22:42] He goes half
[00:22:44] I go why are you showing property?
[00:22:46] Well, my customers trust me. I go why are you showing property?
[00:22:50] He doesn't he doesn't get it. He still doesn't get it. He won't listen. I can't fix that
[00:22:56] But I have a lot of people who fix him right now. I have 16s over the middle of
[00:23:00] Transforming into the modern team model that we teach him
[00:23:02] So
[00:23:04] What I realized early on is what are my superpowers my superpowers. I'm really good actually really really good negotiating
[00:23:11] I'm really really good at finding the house which I still don't do. It's kind of fun
[00:23:14] Uh, and I'm really really good at making sure it closes. It doesn't mean I do all those jobs by the way
[00:23:19] It's just a really good accordingly. So when I talk to my customers, because this is the pushback I get from agents
[00:23:25] Well, my customers trust me like he said earlier. Sure. I go. Yeah, but you they trust you to make sure they get the best deal possible
[00:23:31] And they close
[00:23:33] Anybody can open doors or when I talk to a customer say
[00:23:35] DJ, let me explain how I run my business finally you'll never hear me say how I do my job
[00:23:40] Josh be crazy, right?
[00:23:42] It's how it DJ. Don't explain how I run my business. So my superpower is a negotiate five-year-old negotiate the best deal you'll ever get
[00:23:49] And making sure closes are really really good at it. I'm not really good at it. I'm really really good at it
[00:23:54] Right, and I go what I don't do is I don't show property
[00:23:57] So I want to make sure something's available so you probably when you want to see it and anybody can open the doors right
[00:24:03] Absolutely, and I wait till they say that
[00:24:06] Because they don't say that I'm going to continue on that road. They've never not said it by the way
[00:24:09] Everybody says yes, and I'm always saying anybody's short, right? They also because people know when they walk into a home and it's the right home
[00:24:16] They know
[00:24:17] They don't they maybe they need a little push here and there but but typically speaking they know
[00:24:21] Yeah, there's very little sales in those days. The sales is prospect
[00:24:25] Right, like we talked about earlier. Yes. That's the sales of this is so when you really break down the numbers and the numbers guy
[00:24:32] My average agent when I had my team was working five thousand of bills. I negotiated all the deals my sister wrote all the authors
[00:24:38] They went to they show property went to the inspection with the opposing every five hours
[00:24:43] On a $400,000 sale that meant I was paying them a thousand dollars an hour to show houses
[00:24:49] I
[00:24:50] Can I sign up for that? Can I I'll do that right but that's what everybody does and here's the worst part. Maybe he sent it me
[00:24:59] Because I only gave them 50%
[00:25:01] Right you generated the lead and you're paying them a thousand dollars an hour but you're right but you're right
[00:25:06] They have the employee mentality, right? So with my bottom-team model
[00:25:12] I pay just 25 thousand dollars in the house and now depending on where they are
[00:25:15] I got two teams in California right now they're paying seven five thousand hours. Sure
[00:25:20] So adjusted for living yeah, but I pay seventy five dollars an hour and instead of giving them 50 percent
[00:25:27] I mean 20 thousand already instead of giving them 50 percent. I give them 10% bonus
[00:25:32] And in they're happy. I'm still paying them by the way two hundred fifty dollars now and show houses right right in the end
[00:25:39] But then on my team anymore
[00:25:42] They're just agents that I contract to do tasks
[00:25:45] All right and my team consisted myself and assistant a
[00:25:51] And inside sales agent and a transaction coordinator. That's my team
[00:25:55] No more babysitting
[00:25:57] Now I didn't have a pushback from an agent last week, which is fun. I love getting pushed back. It's so much fun
[00:26:02] So she goes well, you're not nice to new agents said
[00:26:04] I go actually they get to stay in the business now
[00:26:09] Because I wouldn't have given them that to them before right so now and I'm not talking to you leaders
[00:26:14] I'm just about ages of cell 60 70 80 plus homes a year
[00:26:18] It happens almost all those people almost half our our agents almost sure buyers
[00:26:23] Is that actually I get to keep them in the business gifts and number one reason why agents fail is they don't have cash flow right
[00:26:29] I'm giving them cash flow
[00:26:32] So what's I explain actually decided to put you for me
[00:26:35] Uh and so
[00:26:38] What what I'm teaching people is now I can remember my business from anywhere
[00:26:43] Because reality is my system my system can wait for 19 years
[00:26:47] I don't have to do home searches. She doesn't better than I do
[00:26:50] Right she can no get she even the go she's better than I do now
[00:26:53] but
[00:26:54] I don't have to work I and I can do everything I want from anywhere
[00:26:57] If I was still selling now, I would even do listening to them anymore
[00:27:01] I'd pay an agent
[00:27:03] hourly plus a bonus if they get listed I give 250 $250 for the
[00:27:08] For the listing appointment and 10% of they got the listing now would you train them on your listing appointment method?
[00:27:15] No, we have to yeah, so so basically what we're doing is is creating a
[00:27:21] sort of almost
[00:27:23] gig economy
[00:27:25] Sort of situation where people are doing a task they're getting paid for a task and they get a residual if if the deal closes
[00:27:32] You're telling you're setting the expectation to the client here's how it works
[00:27:35] Here's why I do it this way not just hey you're not gonna see me until you know until until the close or close
[00:27:41] No, you're intentionally not going to see me because the most important thing is I get you the highest price
[00:27:46] I close the deal that's what I am best at so what I'm gonna do that
[00:27:51] I'm gonna I'm gonna have my you know my partners do
[00:27:57] Exactly yeah, I think I think that is now here's the question
[00:28:01] You say you're no longer babysitting however
[00:28:04] What if what if an agent is late to an appointment?
[00:28:07] You made they're doing the home showing or or they screw up like how do you how do you sort of deal with that?
[00:28:12] Yeah, I haven't had that problem
[00:28:13] You know the times I've done it wow
[00:28:16] Now if it happens then they would never never use it again
[00:28:19] You know that so it's not like what I have an agent I have to fire anything I just never use it again sure
[00:28:24] You know and the only thing that the only other place that I do get involved like
[00:28:28] When they do pick a house before right the our pride will look at house
[00:28:31] Yeah, because I do my expertise of seeing the leak of the ceiling sure you know I want you know
[00:28:37] I'll do that for my customers, but we're talking about 15 means
[00:28:40] Right half on maybe and now you have time for well and obviously now your children are growing
[00:28:46] But you now have the time that you didn't have yet when when you were younger and they were younger and
[00:28:51] And it's it's it's amazing have you have taught this to people as well
[00:28:56] I am curious to to hear
[00:28:59] Because you are going to get pushback from sorry anyone who's got doing 80 deals a year
[00:29:05] There's an ego associated with that because they've done it successfully and whether they're making money or not
[00:29:11] They're doing 80 deals a year, which is very impressive to the overall community and also their clients
[00:29:16] Yet the quality of their life like you were saying quality of your life wasn't as good as you wanted it to be
[00:29:21] So you're now teaching people what you're really teaching them how to do is have a better quality of life
[00:29:26] And make and just work not not less but more specifically on the things that you enjoy doing
[00:29:33] And then farming out the other things and paying you know a flat fee per per sort of situation
[00:29:38] Yeah, and I'm actually talking about working less
[00:29:41] So so I'm talking about some 80 homes here working very out of the week
[00:29:45] Wow
[00:29:46] And and making a lot more money because now you're profitable
[00:29:50] Yeah, so you're not paying all these people
[00:29:52] so to me
[00:29:56] Again, everybody I know in this business is successful is not successful in life
[00:30:00] And I know that the images are ego and I'm sorry I do that and by the way that person's not the person I'm hungry
[00:30:05] Right just I'll give you an example another example I had a guy
[00:30:09] Revex guy by help me suddenly
[00:30:12] 62 years old so you're younger than me 80 homes you have in the last 35 years wow
[00:30:17] Right is made a ton of money
[00:30:20] So he's making money and when we started talking I said to him never get married never get kids
[00:30:26] He's that guy that oh I gotta make him he couldn't do it right
[00:30:29] Right is working too much yeah, so I said to him I go
[00:30:33] What are you doing? He said what do you mean? I go you know you're gonna die soon right
[00:30:36] Yes, he's 62 years old. Yeah, we got 20 20 years up really kind of 15 of quality years right sure
[00:30:43] I mean I'm gonna look to 142 back then another 40 years of good life
[00:30:47] But the reality is he started crying. Yeah, it was really sad because he never really took the moment to look back at your life
[00:30:55] So here's my but I
[00:30:57] Want you everybody listen to this. I want you to do this exercise
[00:30:59] I call them merit to your success and I do this every single day
[00:31:03] I want you to when you get off this call
[00:31:06] I want you to go in your bathroom
[00:31:08] Looking your eye in the mirror and looking your eyes
[00:31:11] Right because you cannot lie to yourself
[00:31:13] Right to you can that when you're looking at you can rationalize stabbing on the side right but you can't look in your eyes
[00:31:18] Lie yourself and I want you to ask yourself are you really living the life you want to live?
[00:31:23] Yeah, you know what the essence is gonna be it's gonna be no of course. Yeah, it's gonna be now because you're missing your kids
[00:31:29] Grow up you're missing your life and that's what this guy did I and I did I'm lucky
[00:31:34] I'm lucky I figured it out 60 to go forward and now I travel a time and I go wait for a month and nobody knows who gone
[00:31:39] It's great
[00:31:41] Because I run businesses, but I really want to save people right now
[00:31:44] And I actually have another book I'm ready called the big life entrepreneurs
[00:31:49] Then they're stopped writing probably next week or two because I don't want to solve REALTOR's. I want to help everybody
[00:31:54] It's it's a shame that you're making all this money for the ones that are making money
[00:31:59] It's worse if you're not making money and you do it this what the hell you doing
[00:32:02] Uh, but the the ones that are making a three four hundred grand a year and lots of friends of mine
[00:32:07] You're doing that and then they're running a team or they're just it's all the agent and they work in a hundred hours a week
[00:32:12] You're missing your life on to it
[00:32:15] on to it
[00:32:16] Yeah, and you know Mitch you said to me at the beginning and I just want to reiterate this and and I apologize it might seem a bit
[00:32:23] Out of order, but it's so important because I really you know, I always like
[00:32:29] When our our listeners like take action on some of the obviously the things are guests say it and you said something
[00:32:36] Very very powerful and I just want to make sure that people are are here to to hear it one more time
[00:32:42] which is
[00:32:43] Mitch's follow up a part of his follow up was sending two emails a month one was a market update
[00:32:48] And then two weeks later. Uh, here's what's going on in in the area
[00:32:52] Fun cool things for the family for yourself whatever that's that was his follow up and that means that those people got
[00:32:59] six
[00:33:00] Emails a year and and the reason why Mitch said that is you know, do people really want to read your market out?
[00:33:06] Look, maybe maybe not doesn't matter what matters is that they're getting repeated information from you
[00:33:11] That is it could be useful to them. It's not annoying to them and you know, they're just getting that repetition and
[00:33:17] Mitch said the whole thing is precipitated on who's right in front of them when they decide they need to sell or to buy or sell
[00:33:24] And that's exactly right and it's hard not to be on somebody's mind if you're hitting them every two weeks
[00:33:30] Yeah, and the thing is so ultimately
[00:33:33] I um, so one of the books I've always I can't tell you what's the thing because it's not his follow and I was throwing a podcast
[00:33:38] But it's called the Rocks-N-Sales guy
[00:33:41] It's I saw for a buck on Amazon. Rocks-N-Sales guy don't do chicken soup marketing
[00:33:46] Great. I like I give sit-a-e-mail marketing chicken chip marketing person sure, but I know
[00:33:52] They're not gonna pick up the phone. Yeah, I honestly I didn't pick up the phone that right
[00:33:56] Yeah, I'm not I mean, I'm like, you know, I came up with these things for myself, right
[00:34:01] But the reality is is it's it's really that simple and there's two things that people always ask you when I say my REALTOR
[00:34:07] I say you know, I've got some REALTOR the first thing out of the mother's oh, you're REALTOR house the market right
[00:34:12] So that's why we came with the market up to this be sure and it changes every month and people are interested in that and then you like you
[00:34:19] So the top 10 things that we do
[00:34:20] Everybody let's go on so unlike the newsletter we all get email strong people
[00:34:25] That we subscribe to one point and we don't unsubscribe of block that because we like them. Yeah
[00:34:32] So we get these people we never read them. I get you I get 30 newsletters from REALTORS. I haven't read years sure
[00:34:38] Right because that's the same thing people are giving stuff like yeah, they'll give a little market update and then they'll give
[00:34:44] How to get the best garden seeds?
[00:34:46] Be a garden or how to I mean nobody cares
[00:34:50] Nobody cares. I mean, that's just real right nobody cares and I've asked you super zaggo
[00:34:55] Do you ever read you do some newsletters from REALTOR like now?
[00:34:57] You know, and I can see the open rates of the do it when I was doing newsletters nobody looked at it
[00:35:02] But we get about from our phone for our phone list
[00:35:05] We get about 30 to 50% open rate and that is that is a good open rate absolutely good
[00:35:12] I'm a marketer too. I can appreciate
[00:35:15] I wish I was getting those open rates. Oh, they're great. Yeah, I mean you typically on your mask market
[00:35:19] We get about a 15 to 20 percent which is pretty good open rate
[00:35:22] But when we do that phone because here's the thing about the phone contacts you know them all
[00:35:28] Yeah, right and then the and then the messaging I'm gonna give you a line and
[00:35:32] I'll say the slowings I can't for a Boston guy
[00:35:35] But this is the way we end those emails because how you end is really important and it's like this
[00:35:39] As you know as a REALTOR I work by referral only and I could really really use your help
[00:35:45] If you know someone looking to buy a cell phone could you send me their contact info
[00:35:51] Now two things happening. I use the word really really because it's very powerful psychologically. Yep
[00:35:56] And I asked for their contact info not give them my contact info
[00:36:00] Right because they're not going to give them my contact right I did a class recently with 100 agents
[00:36:08] And I don't lose class or off the bonus funds lead lead generation 34 ways to generate leads
[00:36:13] And so I said I made everybody in the class take out their phone
[00:36:17] You go through their phone looks at eight minutes and say help I'm in a class right now
[00:36:21] We're having a contest and I can really really use your help. You know somebody looking to buy some of them
[00:36:26] Same contract right
[00:36:27] We generated 185 leads at eight minutes
[00:36:31] Unbelievable and that's that's more than one almost more than well. It's more than one lead per person
[00:36:36] We know that only happy people actually did it too right?
[00:36:39] Right of course, so it's probably it's even more than that. I was in a bar with one of my agents recently having a drink
[00:36:45] Yeah
[00:36:47] Businesses bad. This is only bad your brain is bad
[00:36:50] This is always good. Sure. If you're slow it's because of you
[00:36:53] All right, and so I said take away from it and I made him do that he texted 50 people he got two responses so too long to two weeks
[00:37:02] Uh, I'm shaking my head only because what a simple idea what a simple concept and look
[00:37:08] The Brian Biffini built a whole coaching business on follow up and sending out Makler's once a month and there's more to it
[00:37:16] Obviously is a lot a lot of good stuff there, but that's the the crux of it is, you know
[00:37:20] Just continually, you know pound away in a way that's not offensive to your to your sphere
[00:37:25] Yeah, and then the only other part I would recommend on that part is pick up the phone for the connectors
[00:37:31] Yeah, like everybody who connects it is right on a connector. You're you want to show your connector right? Yeah
[00:37:36] You know, so but here's the one thing I want you about being a connector
[00:37:39] I have people asking me for stuff all the time. I love as many people in the world and why I love doing
[00:37:44] However, I get very frustrated when it's all about
[00:37:47] Hey, not yet. Yeah, so never ever and your conversation
[00:37:51] Thanks for looking me out and your conversation. What can I do to you? Yes
[00:37:56] All right, and most times people are gonna go oh, I'm good. Oh, but no, but hey, thanks
[00:38:02] It's it's kind of like what we say when somebody you know loses somebody and we say hey
[00:38:07] So if there's anything I can do to help you through this this difficult time and nine times out of 10 they just go
[00:38:12] Oh, thanks for saying that no, I'm good
[00:38:14] But if I need something I'll reach out they don't reach out
[00:38:16] But they appreciate that you care enough to say hey, I want to help you. Yeah, yeah, I'm a huge
[00:38:22] I tell everybody slogan for many many years is I don't sell you I help you
[00:38:26] Yeah, but I still want to tell about my coaching business to that
[00:38:29] If you don't leave me that's great. Don't keep working 100 hours. We can have a miserable life
[00:38:33] It would be a 60 years old you're gonna look back at your life ago. Shit. I miss my kids. I should listen to that guy. It's
[00:38:38] 20 years ago
[00:38:40] But the reality is is
[00:38:42] If you sell from the heart and really care about people this is an easy business people know
[00:38:49] People know if you're just the you know, like what do they call it commission breath, right people know
[00:38:53] I don't care about money even when I lost 82 million dollars and I got this business. I didn't do that
[00:39:00] I said I'm just gonna help as many people as I can and be the best I can be it what I do and I'm not they did by the way
[00:39:06] I'm just I'm okay real sir. I'm not the best. I mean, I can't read you know
[00:39:10] 80d. I mean, you know, I'm okay, but I am a really good business guy
[00:39:15] Yeah, and I always sell from the heart. I
[00:39:17] Yeah, I also the heart. I like the there's a I don't know if it was Jim Rome or I want to really would love to quote
[00:39:26] Properly cite this person who's created it but said this but but I've heard they say if you give other people what they want
[00:39:31] You will give you will get everything you want. Yeah, zig zigzag. Yeah, yeah, do
[00:39:37] Help people get what they want and get what you want. It's and that's how I live my I live my life every business of every own
[00:39:43] It's been the exact same thing
[00:39:45] Yeah, so how do I how do I people with jithicles because then you're not selling anything
[00:39:50] Right like I never ever and people make sure to be in salesperson. Yeah, I'm really really good at it
[00:39:56] You know why cuz I don't sell anything
[00:39:59] Cuz people don't like to be sold
[00:40:01] No, I was I do a Monday morning match to my here in my office
[00:40:05] In which is how this one right before this and they want to description. They're going. I can't teach you scripts
[00:40:11] I've not a script that I do bullet points and I talk to people like a human being
[00:40:16] And I'll say well if you do this today will you do that? No, I saw who was that
[00:40:21] um
[00:40:22] So Brian Tracy
[00:40:24] One of those guys back in the 80s. Yeah, um, and I'm like that is so not me is like using this clothes and that clothes
[00:40:32] I'm like yeah, why not just be a human being
[00:40:35] The worst the one I the one I dislike is the would you like to meet tomorrow at two or Friday at three?
[00:40:42] Yeah, okay, just ask them when they're free like it's not that big for me. Yeah, it's Tom Hopkins
[00:40:48] Yeah, yeah
[00:40:50] But the reality is you know, I'm on a mission. I have um
[00:40:53] You know 63 I don't know how many years I have left in fact my my general manager's my assistant for 90 years
[00:40:58] She's like why you doing all this why you studying a coaching business at 63 years old
[00:41:03] And I just don't feel like I've impacted or not people in the mistake. I made the last 20 years
[00:41:08] I've been coaching ages to 20 years
[00:41:10] I was coaching mostly new agents
[00:41:13] And none of them did the work and I'll give you an example last year. I did 250 coaching calls
[00:41:18] Different agents five did the work
[00:41:21] Wow, and they were all newer and so on jet on December 31st. I gave up new agents
[00:41:26] So if you're new age is out there. I'm the wrong coach for you. I will not go to the engines
[00:41:29] Yeah, and that's what I realized that I've been coaching the wrong people
[00:41:33] I want to teach successful people how do you unbelievably wicked awesome successful? Yeah, right
[00:41:40] And that's like reading freedom and how they actually run it. How do you build your foundation?
[00:41:44] How do you hire the right people to leverage yourself? How do you contract agents that pay 50%
[00:41:51] Right and then I'm still hating you for it. How do you do all that run really successful business where you're being a good dad
[00:41:58] You know, I've been agent locally 20 years old
[00:42:01] It's just proves my point here 20 years old a one year old in a four-year-old
[00:42:06] Working 100 hours equally style working on me
[00:42:08] Now he has cancer and he's made out making
[00:42:12] But his business is running really well right now even though he's in the hospital and chemo
[00:42:16] Wow
[00:42:17] Because I talk a lot of run of business
[00:42:19] And so he's still going to sell 25 homes this year from being second well and we you know, and again
[00:42:25] I it's a horrible thing and and hopefully he makes a speedy recovery and
[00:42:31] The fact that his business is running helps his stress level which has to help his cancer treatments
[00:42:36] I mean, this is we're talking about physical health as well. We're not just talking about time
[00:42:41] You know physical health is a thing and we need to we need to take very good care of that
[00:42:46] Yeah, the reason I get my brokerage of was that I was 56
[00:42:52] And you know, you can't solve brokerage. That's kind of a funny the way they sell the terms of I'm not gonna get that whole joke
[00:42:59] That I went through but uh, but I was my dad died at 50. I'm out of 50
[00:43:03] Almost all my health is I'm in 50's wow in what else 56 my stress levels
[00:43:08] Through the roof my brokerage is you know and because you you're
[00:43:14] You're
[00:43:15] Chasing people to be successful as a broker and the easiest people to bring on is a brokerage
[00:43:20] Is do agents
[00:43:22] So we spend our time doing that even though we know 86% are gonna fail
[00:43:26] We do that and I broke it I went to 500 ages to get 50 good ones. Oh, I I could I I've told I could do that
[00:43:35] I could give you even bigger numbers for me
[00:43:38] Meaning we've had the same experience
[00:43:39] Well, it's what it is and then it is the worst type though, you know this is I asked because I took on all brand new agents
[00:43:46] That was my thing. I'm not bringing on brand new agents. I'm gonna change their lives right
[00:43:50] For me 10 years to figure out I'm never gonna change anything but it's like
[00:43:53] I mean I changed something like that. It's not alive and um, but what I realized is I
[00:44:00] Bit in this sounds horrible. I don't mean to I didn't learn to base my business based on mediocrity
[00:44:06] And that was a hard thing to be the swallow tractor. I think anybody wanted to hear yeah, but I will tell you that if I still had my brokerage today
[00:44:12] I'd be dead
[00:44:13] I would have been dead
[00:44:15] It would have killed my dad died of heart disease stress
[00:44:18] And my stress levels why he actually came to me. It's kind of weird
[00:44:22] But he came to me in a sitting on a plane. He'd been dead for 20 years and I knew he died from stress
[00:44:28] And I was freaking out working 100 hours a week
[00:44:31] Trying to get people from here to here to just that medium, right?
[00:44:36] And so I put on some headphones fight home first class from Denver. I have to help you. I wasn't stolen because it was a personalized pot in Denver
[00:44:43] and uh
[00:44:44] And uh
[00:44:46] I heard a voice. I was listening to music and a voice your expectations and up their expectations
[00:44:51] Three times I heard that voice and I took my headphones off like shit and I realized
[00:44:56] It was my dad talking to me say you were gonna die if you start living by excepting them to be like you
[00:45:01] Yeah, it was probably the biggest lesson I teach I didn't all my speaking gigs right now with this
[00:45:06] I do a longer version of this I do a limited time
[00:45:10] But your expectations are the cause of almost all your disappointment. I could not that is such a powerful statement
[00:45:17] Let's say it again your expectations are the are the cause of all of the challenges you're currently facing almost all your
[00:45:25] Disappointing and I'm talking about from family to customers to friends
[00:45:30] Um, I that day that moment I took those headphones off
[00:45:34] I rewrote my entire business model
[00:45:37] And I said, you know what? I'm gonna be happy wherever they're happy
[00:45:40] But I didn't just do it there. I did it my entire life. I have no expectations of my life
[00:45:45] No expectations of my kids. You know, I personally expectations I control me. Yeah, I can control that one
[00:45:52] But I can't control I can't want for you more than you want for you
[00:45:58] Yeah, and and
[00:46:00] Right we we think you know oftentimes our own drive and motivation can be transferred or can be taught
[00:46:06] And you know, maybe if the stars lined up maybe it could with one person, but you'd go through several hundred
[00:46:13] You know, and I totally agree this idea of not having expectations you actually demonstrated this earlier in this conversation
[00:46:22] I just want to highlight earlier Mitch was talking about the very beginning was talking about your contact list
[00:46:27] And he says you know, we know that 11 out of every hundred contacts you have are going to need a REALTOR
[00:46:32] And you know in the next 12 months or whatever that stat is and it mitch goes I use seven
[00:46:37] Because I want to set the expectation low and you even said that I want to set the expectation low and then
[00:46:42] And then you know rise above it
[00:46:46] Because if you can go if I only get seven out of out of a hundred
[00:46:50] I can maybe I can have a really nice life. I don't have to shoot for for you know this perfect 11 right?
[00:46:56] Yeah, and I use everything so I'll give you the other way is expectations
[00:47:02] Inspections I am not lost to be into inspections in 14 years
[00:47:06] It is like so so so DJ let me explain to you our inspection
[00:47:10] They're going to find 40 or 50 things wrong with the house and the sellers not going to fix any of them
[00:47:15] I just so you know
[00:47:16] So then when they have an inspection contact 15 or 20 things wrong like oh, not to get
[00:47:21] The seller I said the same thing I say look they're going to find 40 or 50 things wrong and the buyers get on what most of them fix
[00:47:27] So they come back and they only want to work by King's fixes. That's great. It's awesome
[00:47:33] Expectations I love this and and what you're doing is you're you're you're really setting this the table for here's what's going to happen
[00:47:42] And then when it happens there's fewer surprises there's oh, this is we expected this this is but oh and we're going to
[00:47:49] Over-shoot in some ways these expectations or undershoot depending on what you know
[00:47:54] How it would benefit the relationship and then we're going to proceed from there and people go back oh
[00:47:58] Thank you for telling me the worst thing is when a REALTOR has a client that goes what's next? What do we do next?
[00:48:04] Right the expectation hasn't been set
[00:48:07] So so for your people I'm listening is I want you to think about a couple things and this is really emotional part because really
[00:48:14] But I tell you that I didn't see my kids grow up
[00:48:17] It's I can tell you I talk about it's my biggest only regret of my life
[00:48:22] And I want you to go home when size is a mirror thing I want you to go home and talk to your spouse if you ever spouse
[00:48:29] And I want you to ask them how to say love for this is
[00:48:33] And I guarantee you they hate the business. There's a great video out there if you don't want to really watch a good video
[00:48:38] If you go to YouTube and tap a rich ribac chinette I always do chinette is it any of you from my wife when but she saw what she hated real estate
[00:48:47] Because I was working 100 hours a week as a president
[00:48:49] I've been really having a conversation with her once she's talking to a because I want to talk
[00:48:53] and
[00:48:55] And 10 minutes of the conversation it's like you haven't heard of where to sit did you
[00:48:59] I go no
[00:49:00] Not aware and I do something had to change
[00:49:02] But I did but there's the other thing I want you to think about if you have kids
[00:49:05] Because again, there's no going back my kids are all between 41 and 45 right now
[00:49:09] No going back there. Probably the other reason why I only work 35 hours a week now because I have four grandkids and that's my life
[00:49:15] I guess way more important than all my money
[00:49:17] Uh, but kids fell love T.I.M.E
[00:49:22] Yeah, and I'm not talking about being there. I'm talking about being present when you're there
[00:49:26] So now we didn't have supples back then right in the 80s and 90s, but I have my brain
[00:49:33] My brain was always thinking about something else now you go
[00:49:35] I go to my grandson's baseball player I go to the baseball game. I don't miss it. I'll fly home
[00:49:39] Or anywhere to be home for his baseball game, okay?
[00:49:42] I miss I'm in this one to give it. I don't miss it
[00:49:44] But anyways, I will tell you which are your parents sitting there on their phones
[00:49:50] Okay, I didn't take my phone. It's in my car
[00:49:54] Yeah, yeah
[00:49:54] I don't take my phone the rest of my girlfriend and I have the same policy
[00:50:00] But because it's so easy to want to do that and there's always something to look at on your phone
[00:50:05] There's always a notification. There's always an email a text or whatever and we say, you know, let's let's not be interrupted
[00:50:11] And we do that when we watch television. That's another thing television
[00:50:15] Movies when we're talking when we're planning our week. Yeah, no cell phones. I agree. Yeah
[00:50:19] The other part that is even your voice mail is wrong
[00:50:23] I'm guessing so you have to set the boundaries
[00:50:27] Yeah, how many doctors can you call it 10 o'clock? Hey, my heart is a work well, right? Not too many right? Yeah
[00:50:32] So you set the boundaries and one of my good friends is a big white geezer in San Diego
[00:50:36] Pete Milton he's
[00:50:39] His his much no, if you're calling you after six o'clock, I look at the next business day
[00:50:44] Right, I used to tell my customers because I didn't work Sundays. I almost died in 2004
[00:50:49] And I stopped working Sundays at that point. I work as working
[00:50:52] About seven days a week, you know, 16 hour days
[00:50:55] So I stopped working when that happened. I just got married three months earlier
[00:50:58] And I'm like, you know what? I'm not working Sundays anymore
[00:51:01] And I say look you have me from eight to eight my day through Saturday
[00:51:04] On Sundays my family day if you can't be stuck that on the wrong guilt to play
[00:51:07] Yeah, never lost the customer
[00:51:09] And I said I have lots of bills and I work with it
[00:51:12] If you need to just need to see a property
[00:51:14] I'll show you now someone came to me with a million dollar property wanted to look at
[00:51:17] I still still have a property of something
[00:51:19] But the reality is I would bet you
[00:51:22] After 2004 that was it July to down the friday bet you I need to work
[00:51:26] By Sunday sunset wow
[00:51:29] Yeah
[00:51:30] Amazing well the book is the big lie and we're gonna have a link to that on you can find out on the amazon
[00:51:36] You can find it really anywhere books are sold we're gonna have a direct link to that and all of mitches books
[00:51:40] Also if you want to have mitch speak or you're interested in his coaching
[00:51:45] mitch reback.com is where you go that's r-i-b-a-k-m-i-t-h-r-i-b-a-k.com
[00:51:52] mitch is dynamic. He's an amazing speaker. He's
[00:51:56] You know more than anything he's proven to be successful not just in real estate
[00:52:00] But in many other industries by applying the exact same principles
[00:52:04] So I know for me it was funny mitch as you were talking what I do is I actually recruit REALTORS
[00:52:09] I don't I don't practice. I have a license but I don't use it
[00:52:11] But I recruit REALTORS and I'm realizing I was doing some of it wrong
[00:52:14] I am going to apply your exact principles to some of the some of the recruiting techniques that that I use or the
[00:52:21] Really it's all follow-up so all the follow-up techniques and you are absolutely right and I am what I'm going to be waiting for is for that broker to say
[00:52:29] You know or that we call brokers in old nibbid agent that agent to say
[00:52:34] Hey, you know, I'm a little disappointed with my firm or something went wrong and they screwed up or I don't like them anymore
[00:52:39] And again if they're getting that regular messaging for me and phone calls as well and other things
[00:52:44] I'm going to be the one that's most
[00:52:45] A
[00:52:48] politely aggressively in a polite way saying I want you I want you
[00:52:51] I want you and then whenever that opportunity comes up hopefully they'll choose
[00:52:55] I'll give you a tip on that so I don't think so. That's my business to the industry right
[00:52:59] Um, so one of the things that I do that works is I give them content
[00:53:05] Yeah, so I have a Monday every Monday tip of the week
[00:53:09] Yep, it goes out to my mr. V just to not with me and I don't push you know
[00:53:14] I'm coaching let me know
[00:53:16] So my coaching I don't charge my agents anything
[00:53:18] Yeah, you know for coaching obviously
[00:53:20] Uh, yeah, so I give you two chances to work we can join me the xp or you can thank my coaching like every else
[00:53:26] Uh, and I'm not a I'm not a degree I see your I'm sure you would better recruit and I even with my brokerage I was never a recruiter
[00:53:33] Like I literally never I never picked up the phone once even with the xp
[00:53:37] I think I called two people
[00:53:40] And actually I've 22 other people now
[00:53:42] Uh, but I think I call two people
[00:53:44] So I'm just that's not who I am you know you live within who you are and have a contribution guy
[00:53:50] Let me help you get whatever you want
[00:53:52] Maybe you'll join me. Maybe you won
[00:53:54] If you do great you don't that's okay to have a good laugh
[00:53:57] I love it Mitch. Thank you on behalf of the audience you gave so many not just great actual tactical strategies
[00:54:05] But also ways to think about your life your business and you know
[00:54:10] Taking a hard look in the mirror and saying okay. What's not going well in my life right now and everyone's got something
[00:54:16] That's not going well in their life at all times
[00:54:18] The trick is to know what it is so if you know what it is you can work on it
[00:54:22] But you can't work on it if you don't have time and time is really what Mitch is aiming to give you back
[00:54:28] You want more time with your family your friends yourself
[00:54:32] You know volunteer opportunities. Whatever you want to do in life
[00:54:36] You need time to do that and this is a job that
[00:54:40] That can if you treat it like a job it can eat up your time if you treat it like your own business
[00:54:44] And you really run it like an entrepreneur then hopefully it will give you back more of that time
[00:54:49] And you can continue to make a good living
[00:54:51] Yeah, okay, so just one last thing I can talk all day
[00:54:55] Uh, I want your mindset to be you invested $250,000 in starting your real estate business not $1500
[00:55:03] Nobody cares about $1500
[00:55:04] Right, but if you invested $250,000
[00:55:07] What would you do differently? I guarantee the word is everything
[00:55:10] Yeah, it's a great point. It's a great point
[00:55:14] So start now this is a great time with the NAR settlement point
[00:55:18] Sort of sort of pushing a lot of agents out because they're ones e2z agents. They're they're leaving
[00:55:24] I will tell you we have a holding company here for people that don't practice
[00:55:28] It's for the whole state of Illinois where the largest one in the state we have 1100 agents in there and we added
[00:55:35] 300 of them since the NAR settlement that is how quickly people are exiting
[00:55:41] So what a great thing for everyone listening because you can pick up their clients
[00:55:44] Prospect prospect prospect follow follow follow
[00:55:47] Mitch is the guy to learn how to do all of those things and run a successful business
[00:55:52] Along the way and maybe figure out how to compensate people like Mitch was doing where you're paying them a flat fee for various tasks
[00:55:59] You're you're focusing on the things you like and that are business building for you and you know
[00:56:05] Mitch is going to show you exactly how to do that check out the book the big live link to that in the show notes

Oh, actually, beyond the United States, not just the United States in seven countries, including the United States, almost as agents and almost every one of the US states, missing one. I'm curious which one he doesn't have. We'll have to see one of our listeners maybe can sign up with them and then he can get the full 50. But TRB, his company tropical beach sidebroker is been in the top 10 real estate brokerages since the opening the doors in 20 2005 tropical beach sidebrealt.

In 2008, Mitch published his first book, 100 mile per hour marketing for real estate and it quickly shot to number one in real estate books. In 2015, Mitch's second book, so you have your real estate license now. What is selling extremely well throughout North America.

Mitch currently lives in Merritt Island, Florida with his wife, Jeanette. They have four grown children and for beautiful grandchildren, Lola, Henry, Cash and Logan. I want everybody to check out Mitch's website, which is Mitch Rebek.com. That's R-I-B-A-K. We'll have a link to that in the show notes. We will also have a link to all of Mitch's books and also everything Mitch related with social media as well. So check that out. Mitch, welcome to the show. Hey, thanks for having me. I appreciate it. Very excited to talk about it. I sound the most important there. It's crazy. Well, you are an important person, and I'm excited that I always find that the most important people, for the most part, tend to be the most humble as well. So we're glad to have you on the show. Tell us, gosh, you've done so many things, and you've done things before real estate. I know you've done things after you're still in real estate, and you're also owning businesses outside of real estate. But tell us like how and why did you get into real estate? Desperation broke. So like you said, I was the first online dating service, which was a lot of fun. I had a at asquitch.com, which is my advice column. I had a asquitch to date Dr. Radio Show on 45 radio stations. Six million people a month can be going to our sites. And then the contract for ridiculous amount of money because that's what we did back in the the.com boom right? Sure. And too much before we were supposed to close, now as you tired you have 40 years old, the in-appable burst and started by $82 million and I lost. I was a bad couple days. And still ran the business until we ran out of money, but after that there was no more raising money in the internet. And so my buddy Joe was a developer from the boss. He's like, Mitch, get your real estate license. I'm like, no, I don't like REALTORS. Why would I do that? He'd be good at it. I don't want to do that. I literally had three months with a remedy left. So I got my real estate license and honestly, it's probably the easiest thing I've ever done besides paintball. Meaning I sold 36 homes in my first year, 50, my second, 80, my third and fourth years since that my team and I started my brokerage. And I don't understand not selling homes because I find it very simple. So we can have some conversations about that, but ultimately it's what you get this because you get what you put into it, right? Yeah. I think it's a very fair business in that sense where if you're willing to put in the effort, I think the path to success, well there's many paths to success as a real estate agent, but those paths have been well-trot and they are well-defined. You can read books. You can watch YouTube videos. You can hire coaches. You can join a brokerage that will assist you. It can be done. And it can be done whether you brand new to a city and you just moved and you have no sphere of influence or you live there your whole life. I am curious for you when you say it's the easiest part that the easiest thing you've done, why do you think you found it so doable? Well, I have a suspicion of why you found it easier than maybe other people would find it. And I suspect, and I want you to correct me if I'm wrong, but I suspect it's because you understand how to run businesses. Yeah, well, I'm an entrepreneur. So yeah, I walked in my first day of the brokerage and my broker the time said, just so you know, I don't do any training at all, but all the things follow up follow up follow up, which by the way, it was a blessing. So on day one, I wrote my business plan. I didn't know anything different. I didn't know real estate's don't write business plans. So day one, I wrote my business plan. Day two is 9-11. So we kind of stopped that thing. Sure. Really bad of ADDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD candy and dinity. So I knew my weaknesses was going to be contracts. So I wrote 30 fake contracts in x-3 days 10 each day. And then I did my first open house on that Saturday. And I just talked to people what a concept. I didn't have a state of influence because the only person I knew is my girlfriend who's now my wife and her mother and she lived with me. She wasn't by any way. So I I knew I had a generate needs because every business in the world has the same sales cycle generate needs their true needs Close the lead and create a customer for life. I don't care what product you sell it's the same. That's that's that's the cycle for sure So I knew all this stuff going in so I had a little advantage over your average person who was a teacher or a bartender or whatever they did prior But I knew I had a generate needs I knew I didn't know anybody everybody told me don't do open house and don't do internet 2001 so open houses like said if you're told me not to do that but people are coming to me. How can that be a bad thing? I'm getting leads Yeah, and the same thing with internet my background was internet being the first online dating service. So why would I not do that? So I did I went my first contract from five days in and I Started in September that January had nine closings Wow, and so one of the things I learned and I started this from day one not knowing to do this But my January first is actually November first And what I've learned is during November, December almost every real trade no quiz They they hit their they go into hibernation Well, they they hit their goal and they're stopped. I'm gonna take a break Well, they did hit their goal. They won't hit it so they take a break They take a break and it's and it's a holiday that I learned why not excel during November December So I start off with a massive amount of sales and so I started by you going strong So I didn't have any Like if you build a really good system, you don't have mountains. I had two months of my entire selling career where I didn't have sales It's incredible because you were always focused on lead gen and nurturing and follow up and that can be done Really any day of the year no matter what's happening Yeah, maybe you know, obviously 9-11 probably wouldn't have been the right day But aside from a major catastrophe like that any day of the day of the year You can prospect whether it's you know, and again holidays excluded maybe but you can even do it Maybe on the holidays, but but certainly it you're right. We have agents. They shut down They tend to shut down at the later part of the year You know, there's not as much activity which is what what they'll say there's not as many buyers not as many sellers people aren't as motivated and Yet the people I know who are the most successful don't stop they really it's just like okay They just pivot and they just do different things between you know, November and December and yeah and and the rest of us It's really a great time to pick up market share I think because so many agents are are gonna take it easy. Yeah, well, that's what they do They you know, it's kind of These are what the part of the big lie. It's kind of what we're talking. It's really slow in November December So actually you rebuild your systems and get all this stuff going and of course then you start working in January You have your first contract late January February you'll be first picked it to late February My I was like it is a brokerage. I was the central bank of REALTORS for every every January in February because that my wealth is work And then it's never a five grand I can't get my mortgage and Yeah, you know, and this really leads us into what I think you know again You're obviously a skilled salesperson and I don't I don't I know that can even be sort of seen as a negative Caution these days because we think sometimes salespeople are are not you know, maybe not the most You know good feeling people that that that we when we think about it But Mitch is really what he is is a great visit a great entrepreneur and a great lead generator and I heard Brian I think it was Brian Tracy said many many years ago in a 20 years ago I heard him in a conference and he said just so you know for all your business owners prospecting solves all problems and And you know and of course that's not absolutely true But it's pretty close to absolutely true because if you have you know, you could be a terrible REALTOR You could never improve your skills and if all you did was double the number of prospects that you have in your database You will double your business just I mean Assuming assuming you would and that's a pretty interesting thing so you don't of course you want to improve your skills as well But if you just double your double your prospecting you should double your income Well, here's what I've realized a few years There's one common alley for every business that I've owned It is building the foundation and what's the foundation? It's who's my customer where are they? Yeah, every business ever brought and I didn't have that blessing here because I did know he looks at my girlfriend But this most of the world is I need within trade they have more contacts in their cell phone Then they'll ever need the rest of their life Couldn't I could not agree with you more and I want to I want to just say this In case it just slipped by and and people didn't hear it what Mitch just said is in Mitch has two thousand agents So this is not something he's not just like well just works for Mitch No, no, Mitch is this is what Mitch teaches everybody. It's the reason why he's been so successful Everybody listening right now has more contacts in their database Then then they probably need because a certain percentage of those people are going to transact in real estate Every single year and you wouldn't of course be the person they think about Yeah, and the numbers actually seven out of a hundred So we know the number that's been around for a lot of you know, it's been around for a lot of years They actually say a lot of I like to say I like to set expectations low sure but but the reality is so I'll give you the except I have two thousand contacts in my phone I really create to a hundred and forty sales this year Now you have to go back and say why does someone use you as a REALTOR And there's only one reason Right, so I'll ask that I did a class of about a thousand people recently and I asked that not one person got it right The only week Can I guess yeah, okay, my guess is the reason why they chose you is they trust you See I'm wrong, okay, tell me why they chose you they only use you because you happen to be in front of them That they keep on buying or selling you know what that is absolutely true That's it I stopped selling a few years ago. I really got to look at the business completely different Now I have I've always was working in the I was just as guilty. That's where I get my book But where he in the business not on the business and when I step back three years ago from selling Um, and by the way, I was always in front of my people twice a month and I would get 40 to 80 calls every year To sell home now. I didn't sell that because I didn't want to right but I got that money The day I stopped which is October 2021 the next year. I got six phone calls This year I've got three Because I stopped doing it. I don't want to stop it anymore now I might go back and build a referral company for the front of it because I'm an entrepreneur and I have to do stuff But um, but the reality is that's the reason so once you know that Then you have to sign to think me That's made up for it by the way you have to figure out what's the right response. We've tested all this the years now We've learned if you said once a once a week. It's too much Yeah, if you said once a month or so. I'm not that's when we came up with the every other week Yeah, it's if you are dripping on people every other week and I imagine does this include all forms of communication This could be email text So that's just email just email so emailing every two weeks with something of value So there's only two things you only two things you said to him. This is so simple my way. I love it The first email that goes out is the market update because it's different every month and people will look at it Most of us will send these newsletters if nobody cares about right that's true Yeah, do you read newsletters if you want to say do you read them easily? I did a presentation once called nobody wants to read your newsletter That's right. So the first one is that and then the second one two weeks later to top 10 things out is my top 10 things to do in the market Okay, this is a brilliant thing so I'm here in Chicago Mitch. I apologize I don't when you steal your thunder, but Mitch is so absolutely dead on I have a friend Nicole She's I wish she was one of our brokers. She isn't but she's a friend of mine here in Chicago. We have 47,000 agents in the in the area She's the oh, I'm sure there's a few others that do it But the only one I know and I know I know a lot of those agents the only one that does Top she does top five things to do this weekend in the city of Chicago in the suburbs kind of you know And I look forward to it every week because I actually plan my weekends with it So this is such a brilliant idea. I'm so glad you do that So last last agent I talked to do this at her first four months got six or six and four miles out of a database of only 400 Wow Yeah, so so again goes back to building your foundation which unfortunately most brokers don't know that either Right and nothing gets broken. So it's just that one of the lot of companies you learn by losing millions of millions of millions of dollars How to be good? Yeah, well, you have to be willing to fail too, right? You have to be willing to try things and and you know And again, it's not really a failure, but not getting the the result that you wanted and then going okay How do I you know it's only way we learn is through through mistakes, right? And testing is really important so when I started out again being with the optional backup I didn't do things for a week until I didn't work my minimum test was six months Yeah, everything is when I'm mastered open houses and I never so less than 24 homes in a year from open houses Always between 24 and 30 homes I just mastered it and I keep up with different things like oh if I do this this will happen What if than this right And it came really simple and became a lot of things so the blessing of not being any trading everything that I I developed I developed like internet leak a version when I was the first person doing post registration in January 2002 I started my first website and nobody was doing post registration Right. Yeah, we was right. That's true. I had so many REALTORS yell at me. I can't believe you make people register on your site I'm like I can't believe you don't yeah Right, this is we want their information. So they said well, I said 50% of the people are registering They're like what about the other 85% I like want about yeah, I'll go some So it's just thinking differently so that was you know when I looked back at my business over the last year The last 23 years. I mean the business the thing at the common thing I think the people that we see is successful in our business Our successful selling homes, but they're not successful in business Yeah, there's a lot of top producers that I suspect they don't often share this although some of them have shared this even on this show Is that they could have the highest production year Uh, ever maybe it's selling 80 homes or more and they're like I didn't make any money and and that's shocking But it's something to think about because maybe they're overspending or they're not managing the finances whatever Well, they're not money and business, but you know, I said earlier you know, we're talking before the show is you know most people don't look happy job Now they might they might own their copy job And well, that's not just real, so it's everybody I know every call business that doesn't really want to business They have a copy job right and they get and they get better at finding what I tell them. That's just reality So to be when I look back at my friends at a sling 80 homes when I was selling 80 homes here I mean I had a copy job for the 80 100 hours week And I wasn't making good money couple two 300 thousand dollars a year But the reality is I had my life You know, no it's all okay to fruition when I turned 60 and I look back at my life I said Could we do that with every 10 years of your life right and I look back and say I cannot tell you five things to take you with my kids When they're growing up and that hurts sure and there's a lot of you out there right now that are in your 30s and 40s or 20s They have little kids that's your most important job Right your businesses your business if you run a business, but you're most important job is not to do it. I did That's why I preach it's why I broke the book I wrote this book in 90 days my last two books took me two years each I didn't 90 days because I blocked out four hours a day to write So I can make sure I give this book out because I didn't post on social media just talking about that About how most people build copy jobs and I got two hundred and sixty two responses Wow and and everybody was in pain And so people say Mitch what are you teaching now? I mean I can teach all this stuff to sell houses But really when I teach this teach how to get freedom Yeah, let's talk about that. So the book is the big lie Let's let's tell us what is the big lie? It's the big lie sell a lot of homes and you'll be successful and once you do that start a team Yeah, they don't tell you gonna start a big city job And then because you need to get more split because you're not making money as a team you started brokerage Right and it's all ego based Like I know so many of my friends why I adore who will not listen to me because I'm the guy And by my own my brokerage with the 120 agents, you know I was the guy. It's really feels good, right? That doesn't pay your bills. It feels good Sure, so I see these guys don't give it in simple one of my friends. He does about eight go hundred homes every year Uh, he works at least a hundred hours a week And there's a reason why there's a hamster on the cover of my book uh, and I said why are you doing that? How many people are you doing the their buyers? He goes half I go why are you showing property? Well, my customers trust me. I go why are you showing property? He doesn't he doesn't get it. He still doesn't get it. He won't listen. I can't fix that But I have a lot of people who fix him right now. I have 16s over the middle of Transforming into the modern team model that we teach him So What I realized early on is what are my superpowers my superpowers. I'm really good actually really really good negotiating I'm really really good at finding the house which I still don't do. It's kind of fun Uh, and I'm really really good at making sure it closes. It doesn't mean I do all those jobs by the way It's just a really good accordingly. So when I talk to my customers, because this is the pushback I get from agents Well, my customers trust me like he said earlier. Sure. I go. Yeah, but you they trust you to make sure they get the best deal possible And they close Anybody can open doors or when I talk to a customer say DJ, let me explain how I run my business finally you'll never hear me say how I do my job Josh be crazy, right? It's how it DJ. Don't explain how I run my business. So my superpower is a negotiate five-year-old negotiate the best deal you'll ever get And making sure closes are really really good at it. I'm not really good at it. I'm really really good at it Right, and I go what I don't do is I don't show property So I want to make sure something's available so you probably when you want to see it and anybody can open the doors right Absolutely, and I wait till they say that Because they don't say that I'm going to continue on that road. They've never not said it by the way Everybody says yes, and I'm always saying anybody's short, right? They also because people know when they walk into a home and it's the right home They know They don't they maybe they need a little push here and there but but typically speaking they know Yeah, there's very little sales in those days. The sales is prospect Right, like we talked about earlier. Yes. That's the sales of this is so when you really break down the numbers and the numbers guy My average agent when I had my team was working five thousand of bills. I negotiated all the deals my sister wrote all the authors They went to they show property went to the inspection with the opposing every five hours On a $400,000 sale that meant I was paying them a thousand dollars an hour to show houses I Can I sign up for that? Can I I'll do that right but that's what everybody does and here's the worst part. Maybe he sent it me Because I only gave them 50% Right you generated the lead and you're paying them a thousand dollars an hour but you're right but you're right They have the employee mentality, right? So with my bottom-team model I pay just 25 thousand dollars in the house and now depending on where they are I got two teams in California right now they're paying seven five thousand hours. Sure So adjusted for living yeah, but I pay seventy five dollars an hour and instead of giving them 50 percent I mean 20 thousand already instead of giving them 50 percent. I give them 10% bonus And in they're happy. I'm still paying them by the way two hundred fifty dollars now and show houses right right in the end But then on my team anymore They're just agents that I contract to do tasks All right and my team consisted myself and assistant a And inside sales agent and a transaction coordinator. That's my team No more babysitting Now I didn't have a pushback from an agent last week, which is fun. I love getting pushed back. It's so much fun So she goes well, you're not nice to new agents said I go actually they get to stay in the business now Because I wouldn't have given them that to them before right so now and I'm not talking to you leaders I'm just about ages of cell 60 70 80 plus homes a year It happens almost all those people almost half our our agents almost sure buyers Is that actually I get to keep them in the business gifts and number one reason why agents fail is they don't have cash flow right I'm giving them cash flow So what's I explain actually decided to put you for me Uh and so What what I'm teaching people is now I can remember my business from anywhere Because reality is my system my system can wait for 19 years I don't have to do home searches. She doesn't better than I do Right she can no get she even the go she's better than I do now but I don't have to work I and I can do everything I want from anywhere If I was still selling now, I would even do listening to them anymore I'd pay an agent hourly plus a bonus if they get listed I give 250 $250 for the For the listing appointment and 10% of they got the listing now would you train them on your listing appointment method? No, we have to yeah, so so basically what we're doing is is creating a sort of almost gig economy Sort of situation where people are doing a task they're getting paid for a task and they get a residual if if the deal closes You're telling you're setting the expectation to the client here's how it works Here's why I do it this way not just hey you're not gonna see me until you know until until the close or close No, you're intentionally not going to see me because the most important thing is I get you the highest price I close the deal that's what I am best at so what I'm gonna do that I'm gonna I'm gonna have my you know my partners do Exactly yeah, I think I think that is now here's the question You say you're no longer babysitting however What if what if an agent is late to an appointment? You made they're doing the home showing or or they screw up like how do you how do you sort of deal with that? Yeah, I haven't had that problem You know the times I've done it wow Now if it happens then they would never never use it again You know that so it's not like what I have an agent I have to fire anything I just never use it again sure You know and the only thing that the only other place that I do get involved like When they do pick a house before right the our pride will look at house Yeah, because I do my expertise of seeing the leak of the ceiling sure you know I want you know I'll do that for my customers, but we're talking about 15 means Right half on maybe and now you have time for well and obviously now your children are growing But you now have the time that you didn't have yet when when you were younger and they were younger and And it's it's it's amazing have you have taught this to people as well I am curious to to hear Because you are going to get pushback from sorry anyone who's got doing 80 deals a year There's an ego associated with that because they've done it successfully and whether they're making money or not They're doing 80 deals a year, which is very impressive to the overall community and also their clients Yet the quality of their life like you were saying quality of your life wasn't as good as you wanted it to be So you're now teaching people what you're really teaching them how to do is have a better quality of life And make and just work not not less but more specifically on the things that you enjoy doing And then farming out the other things and paying you know a flat fee per per sort of situation Yeah, and I'm actually talking about working less So so I'm talking about some 80 homes here working very out of the week Wow And and making a lot more money because now you're profitable Yeah, so you're not paying all these people so to me Again, everybody I know in this business is successful is not successful in life And I know that the images are ego and I'm sorry I do that and by the way that person's not the person I'm hungry Right just I'll give you an example another example I had a guy Revex guy by help me suddenly 62 years old so you're younger than me 80 homes you have in the last 35 years wow Right is made a ton of money So he's making money and when we started talking I said to him never get married never get kids He's that guy that oh I gotta make him he couldn't do it right Right is working too much yeah, so I said to him I go What are you doing? He said what do you mean? I go you know you're gonna die soon right Yes, he's 62 years old. Yeah, we got 20 20 years up really kind of 15 of quality years right sure I mean I'm gonna look to 142 back then another 40 years of good life But the reality is he started crying. Yeah, it was really sad because he never really took the moment to look back at your life So here's my but I Want you everybody listen to this. I want you to do this exercise I call them merit to your success and I do this every single day I want you to when you get off this call I want you to go in your bathroom Looking your eye in the mirror and looking your eyes Right because you cannot lie to yourself Right to you can that when you're looking at you can rationalize stabbing on the side right but you can't look in your eyes Lie yourself and I want you to ask yourself are you really living the life you want to live? Yeah, you know what the essence is gonna be it's gonna be no of course. Yeah, it's gonna be now because you're missing your kids Grow up you're missing your life and that's what this guy did I and I did I'm lucky I'm lucky I figured it out 60 to go forward and now I travel a time and I go wait for a month and nobody knows who gone It's great Because I run businesses, but I really want to save people right now And I actually have another book I'm ready called the big life entrepreneurs Then they're stopped writing probably next week or two because I don't want to solve REALTOR's. I want to help everybody It's it's a shame that you're making all this money for the ones that are making money It's worse if you're not making money and you do it this what the hell you doing Uh, but the the ones that are making a three four hundred grand a year and lots of friends of mine You're doing that and then they're running a team or they're just it's all the agent and they work in a hundred hours a week You're missing your life on to it on to it Yeah, and you know Mitch you said to me at the beginning and I just want to reiterate this and and I apologize it might seem a bit Out of order, but it's so important because I really you know, I always like When our our listeners like take action on some of the obviously the things are guests say it and you said something Very very powerful and I just want to make sure that people are are here to to hear it one more time which is Mitch's follow up a part of his follow up was sending two emails a month one was a market update And then two weeks later. Uh, here's what's going on in in the area Fun cool things for the family for yourself whatever that's that was his follow up and that means that those people got six Emails a year and and the reason why Mitch said that is you know, do people really want to read your market out? Look, maybe maybe not doesn't matter what matters is that they're getting repeated information from you That is it could be useful to them. It's not annoying to them and you know, they're just getting that repetition and Mitch said the whole thing is precipitated on who's right in front of them when they decide they need to sell or to buy or sell And that's exactly right and it's hard not to be on somebody's mind if you're hitting them every two weeks Yeah, and the thing is so ultimately I um, so one of the books I've always I can't tell you what's the thing because it's not his follow and I was throwing a podcast But it's called the Rocks-N-Sales guy It's I saw for a buck on Amazon. Rocks-N-Sales guy don't do chicken soup marketing Great. I like I give sit-a-e-mail marketing chicken chip marketing person sure, but I know They're not gonna pick up the phone. Yeah, I honestly I didn't pick up the phone that right Yeah, I'm not I mean, I'm like, you know, I came up with these things for myself, right But the reality is is it's it's really that simple and there's two things that people always ask you when I say my REALTOR I say you know, I've got some REALTOR the first thing out of the mother's oh, you're REALTOR house the market right So that's why we came with the market up to this be sure and it changes every month and people are interested in that and then you like you So the top 10 things that we do Everybody let's go on so unlike the newsletter we all get email strong people That we subscribe to one point and we don't unsubscribe of block that because we like them. Yeah So we get these people we never read them. I get you I get 30 newsletters from REALTORS. I haven't read years sure Right because that's the same thing people are giving stuff like yeah, they'll give a little market update and then they'll give How to get the best garden seeds? Be a garden or how to I mean nobody cares Nobody cares. I mean, that's just real right nobody cares and I've asked you super zaggo Do you ever read you do some newsletters from REALTOR like now? You know, and I can see the open rates of the do it when I was doing newsletters nobody looked at it But we get about from our phone for our phone list We get about 30 to 50% open rate and that is that is a good open rate absolutely good I'm a marketer too. I can appreciate I wish I was getting those open rates. Oh, they're great. Yeah, I mean you typically on your mask market We get about a 15 to 20 percent which is pretty good open rate But when we do that phone because here's the thing about the phone contacts you know them all Yeah, right and then the and then the messaging I'm gonna give you a line and I'll say the slowings I can't for a Boston guy But this is the way we end those emails because how you end is really important and it's like this As you know as a REALTOR I work by referral only and I could really really use your help If you know someone looking to buy a cell phone could you send me their contact info Now two things happening. I use the word really really because it's very powerful psychologically. Yep And I asked for their contact info not give them my contact info Right because they're not going to give them my contact right I did a class recently with 100 agents And I don't lose class or off the bonus funds lead lead generation 34 ways to generate leads And so I said I made everybody in the class take out their phone You go through their phone looks at eight minutes and say help I'm in a class right now We're having a contest and I can really really use your help. You know somebody looking to buy some of them Same contract right We generated 185 leads at eight minutes Unbelievable and that's that's more than one almost more than well. It's more than one lead per person We know that only happy people actually did it too right? Right of course, so it's probably it's even more than that. I was in a bar with one of my agents recently having a drink Yeah Businesses bad. This is only bad your brain is bad This is always good. Sure. If you're slow it's because of you All right, and so I said take away from it and I made him do that he texted 50 people he got two responses so too long to two weeks Uh, I'm shaking my head only because what a simple idea what a simple concept and look The Brian Biffini built a whole coaching business on follow up and sending out Makler's once a month and there's more to it Obviously is a lot a lot of good stuff there, but that's the the crux of it is, you know Just continually, you know pound away in a way that's not offensive to your to your sphere Yeah, and then the only other part I would recommend on that part is pick up the phone for the connectors Yeah, like everybody who connects it is right on a connector. You're you want to show your connector right? Yeah You know, so but here's the one thing I want you about being a connector I have people asking me for stuff all the time. I love as many people in the world and why I love doing However, I get very frustrated when it's all about Hey, not yet. Yeah, so never ever and your conversation Thanks for looking me out and your conversation. What can I do to you? Yes All right, and most times people are gonna go oh, I'm good. Oh, but no, but hey, thanks It's it's kind of like what we say when somebody you know loses somebody and we say hey So if there's anything I can do to help you through this this difficult time and nine times out of 10 they just go Oh, thanks for saying that no, I'm good But if I need something I'll reach out they don't reach out But they appreciate that you care enough to say hey, I want to help you. Yeah, yeah, I'm a huge I tell everybody slogan for many many years is I don't sell you I help you Yeah, but I still want to tell about my coaching business to that If you don't leave me that's great. Don't keep working 100 hours. We can have a miserable life It would be a 60 years old you're gonna look back at your life ago. Shit. I miss my kids. I should listen to that guy. It's 20 years ago But the reality is is If you sell from the heart and really care about people this is an easy business people know People know if you're just the you know, like what do they call it commission breath, right people know I don't care about money even when I lost 82 million dollars and I got this business. I didn't do that I said I'm just gonna help as many people as I can and be the best I can be it what I do and I'm not they did by the way I'm just I'm okay real sir. I'm not the best. I mean, I can't read you know 80d. I mean, you know, I'm okay, but I am a really good business guy Yeah, and I always sell from the heart. I Yeah, I also the heart. I like the there's a I don't know if it was Jim Rome or I want to really would love to quote Properly cite this person who's created it but said this but but I've heard they say if you give other people what they want You will give you will get everything you want. Yeah, zig zigzag. Yeah, yeah, do Help people get what they want and get what you want. It's and that's how I live my I live my life every business of every own It's been the exact same thing Yeah, so how do I how do I people with jithicles because then you're not selling anything Right like I never ever and people make sure to be in salesperson. Yeah, I'm really really good at it You know why cuz I don't sell anything Cuz people don't like to be sold No, I was I do a Monday morning match to my here in my office In which is how this one right before this and they want to description. They're going. I can't teach you scripts I've not a script that I do bullet points and I talk to people like a human being And I'll say well if you do this today will you do that? No, I saw who was that um So Brian Tracy One of those guys back in the 80s. Yeah, um, and I'm like that is so not me is like using this clothes and that clothes I'm like yeah, why not just be a human being The worst the one I the one I dislike is the would you like to meet tomorrow at two or Friday at three? Yeah, okay, just ask them when they're free like it's not that big for me. Yeah, it's Tom Hopkins Yeah, yeah But the reality is you know, I'm on a mission. I have um You know 63 I don't know how many years I have left in fact my my general manager's my assistant for 90 years She's like why you doing all this why you studying a coaching business at 63 years old And I just don't feel like I've impacted or not people in the mistake. I made the last 20 years I've been coaching ages to 20 years I was coaching mostly new agents And none of them did the work and I'll give you an example last year. I did 250 coaching calls Different agents five did the work Wow, and they were all newer and so on jet on December 31st. I gave up new agents So if you're new age is out there. I'm the wrong coach for you. I will not go to the engines Yeah, and that's what I realized that I've been coaching the wrong people I want to teach successful people how do you unbelievably wicked awesome successful? Yeah, right And that's like reading freedom and how they actually run it. How do you build your foundation? How do you hire the right people to leverage yourself? How do you contract agents that pay 50% Right and then I'm still hating you for it. How do you do all that run really successful business where you're being a good dad You know, I've been agent locally 20 years old It's just proves my point here 20 years old a one year old in a four-year-old Working 100 hours equally style working on me Now he has cancer and he's made out making But his business is running really well right now even though he's in the hospital and chemo Wow Because I talk a lot of run of business And so he's still going to sell 25 homes this year from being second well and we you know, and again I it's a horrible thing and and hopefully he makes a speedy recovery and The fact that his business is running helps his stress level which has to help his cancer treatments I mean, this is we're talking about physical health as well. We're not just talking about time You know physical health is a thing and we need to we need to take very good care of that Yeah, the reason I get my brokerage of was that I was 56 And you know, you can't solve brokerage. That's kind of a funny the way they sell the terms of I'm not gonna get that whole joke That I went through but uh, but I was my dad died at 50. I'm out of 50 Almost all my health is I'm in 50's wow in what else 56 my stress levels Through the roof my brokerage is you know and because you you're You're Chasing people to be successful as a broker and the easiest people to bring on is a brokerage Is do agents So we spend our time doing that even though we know 86% are gonna fail We do that and I broke it I went to 500 ages to get 50 good ones. Oh, I I could I I've told I could do that I could give you even bigger numbers for me Meaning we've had the same experience Well, it's what it is and then it is the worst type though, you know this is I asked because I took on all brand new agents That was my thing. I'm not bringing on brand new agents. I'm gonna change their lives right For me 10 years to figure out I'm never gonna change anything but it's like I mean I changed something like that. It's not alive and um, but what I realized is I Bit in this sounds horrible. I don't mean to I didn't learn to base my business based on mediocrity And that was a hard thing to be the swallow tractor. I think anybody wanted to hear yeah, but I will tell you that if I still had my brokerage today I'd be dead I would have been dead It would have killed my dad died of heart disease stress And my stress levels why he actually came to me. It's kind of weird But he came to me in a sitting on a plane. He'd been dead for 20 years and I knew he died from stress And I was freaking out working 100 hours a week Trying to get people from here to here to just that medium, right? And so I put on some headphones fight home first class from Denver. I have to help you. I wasn't stolen because it was a personalized pot in Denver and uh And uh I heard a voice. I was listening to music and a voice your expectations and up their expectations Three times I heard that voice and I took my headphones off like shit and I realized It was my dad talking to me say you were gonna die if you start living by excepting them to be like you Yeah, it was probably the biggest lesson I teach I didn't all my speaking gigs right now with this I do a longer version of this I do a limited time But your expectations are the cause of almost all your disappointment. I could not that is such a powerful statement Let's say it again your expectations are the are the cause of all of the challenges you're currently facing almost all your Disappointing and I'm talking about from family to customers to friends Um, I that day that moment I took those headphones off I rewrote my entire business model And I said, you know what? I'm gonna be happy wherever they're happy But I didn't just do it there. I did it my entire life. I have no expectations of my life No expectations of my kids. You know, I personally expectations I control me. Yeah, I can control that one But I can't control I can't want for you more than you want for you Yeah, and and Right we we think you know oftentimes our own drive and motivation can be transferred or can be taught And you know, maybe if the stars lined up maybe it could with one person, but you'd go through several hundred You know, and I totally agree this idea of not having expectations you actually demonstrated this earlier in this conversation I just want to highlight earlier Mitch was talking about the very beginning was talking about your contact list And he says you know, we know that 11 out of every hundred contacts you have are going to need a REALTOR And you know in the next 12 months or whatever that stat is and it mitch goes I use seven Because I want to set the expectation low and you even said that I want to set the expectation low and then And then you know rise above it Because if you can go if I only get seven out of out of a hundred I can maybe I can have a really nice life. I don't have to shoot for for you know this perfect 11 right? Yeah, and I use everything so I'll give you the other way is expectations Inspections I am not lost to be into inspections in 14 years It is like so so so DJ let me explain to you our inspection They're going to find 40 or 50 things wrong with the house and the sellers not going to fix any of them I just so you know So then when they have an inspection contact 15 or 20 things wrong like oh, not to get The seller I said the same thing I say look they're going to find 40 or 50 things wrong and the buyers get on what most of them fix So they come back and they only want to work by King's fixes. That's great. It's awesome Expectations I love this and and what you're doing is you're you're you're really setting this the table for here's what's going to happen And then when it happens there's fewer surprises there's oh, this is we expected this this is but oh and we're going to Over-shoot in some ways these expectations or undershoot depending on what you know How it would benefit the relationship and then we're going to proceed from there and people go back oh Thank you for telling me the worst thing is when a REALTOR has a client that goes what's next? What do we do next? Right the expectation hasn't been set So so for your people I'm listening is I want you to think about a couple things and this is really emotional part because really But I tell you that I didn't see my kids grow up It's I can tell you I talk about it's my biggest only regret of my life And I want you to go home when size is a mirror thing I want you to go home and talk to your spouse if you ever spouse And I want you to ask them how to say love for this is And I guarantee you they hate the business. There's a great video out there if you don't want to really watch a good video If you go to YouTube and tap a rich ribac chinette I always do chinette is it any of you from my wife when but she saw what she hated real estate Because I was working 100 hours a week as a president I've been really having a conversation with her once she's talking to a because I want to talk and And 10 minutes of the conversation it's like you haven't heard of where to sit did you I go no Not aware and I do something had to change But I did but there's the other thing I want you to think about if you have kids Because again, there's no going back my kids are all between 41 and 45 right now No going back there. Probably the other reason why I only work 35 hours a week now because I have four grandkids and that's my life I guess way more important than all my money Uh, but kids fell love T.I.M.E Yeah, and I'm not talking about being there. I'm talking about being present when you're there So now we didn't have supples back then right in the 80s and 90s, but I have my brain My brain was always thinking about something else now you go I go to my grandson's baseball player I go to the baseball game. I don't miss it. I'll fly home Or anywhere to be home for his baseball game, okay? I miss I'm in this one to give it. I don't miss it But anyways, I will tell you which are your parents sitting there on their phones Okay, I didn't take my phone. It's in my car Yeah, yeah I don't take my phone the rest of my girlfriend and I have the same policy But because it's so easy to want to do that and there's always something to look at on your phone There's always a notification. There's always an email a text or whatever and we say, you know, let's let's not be interrupted And we do that when we watch television. That's another thing television Movies when we're talking when we're planning our week. Yeah, no cell phones. I agree. Yeah The other part that is even your voice mail is wrong I'm guessing so you have to set the boundaries Yeah, how many doctors can you call it 10 o'clock? Hey, my heart is a work well, right? Not too many right? Yeah So you set the boundaries and one of my good friends is a big white geezer in San Diego Pete Milton he's His his much no, if you're calling you after six o'clock, I look at the next business day Right, I used to tell my customers because I didn't work Sundays. I almost died in 2004 And I stopped working Sundays at that point. I work as working About seven days a week, you know, 16 hour days So I stopped working when that happened. I just got married three months earlier And I'm like, you know what? I'm not working Sundays anymore And I say look you have me from eight to eight my day through Saturday On Sundays my family day if you can't be stuck that on the wrong guilt to play Yeah, never lost the customer And I said I have lots of bills and I work with it If you need to just need to see a property I'll show you now someone came to me with a million dollar property wanted to look at I still still have a property of something But the reality is I would bet you After 2004 that was it July to down the friday bet you I need to work By Sunday sunset wow Yeah Amazing well the book is the big lie and we're gonna have a link to that on you can find out on the amazon You can find it really anywhere books are sold we're gonna have a direct link to that and all of mitches books Also if you want to have mitch speak or you're interested in his coaching mitch reback.com is where you go that's r-i-b-a-k-m-i-t-h-r-i-b-a-k.com mitch is dynamic. He's an amazing speaker. He's You know more than anything he's proven to be successful not just in real estate But in many other industries by applying the exact same principles So I know for me it was funny mitch as you were talking what I do is I actually recruit REALTORS I don't I don't practice. I have a license but I don't use it But I recruit REALTORS and I'm realizing I was doing some of it wrong I am going to apply your exact principles to some of the some of the recruiting techniques that that I use or the Really it's all follow-up so all the follow-up techniques and you are absolutely right and I am what I'm going to be waiting for is for that broker to say You know or that we call brokers in old nibbid agent that agent to say Hey, you know, I'm a little disappointed with my firm or something went wrong and they screwed up or I don't like them anymore And again if they're getting that regular messaging for me and phone calls as well and other things I'm going to be the one that's most A politely aggressively in a polite way saying I want you I want you I want you and then whenever that opportunity comes up hopefully they'll choose I'll give you a tip on that so I don't think so. That's my business to the industry right Um, so one of the things that I do that works is I give them content Yeah, so I have a Monday every Monday tip of the week Yep, it goes out to my mr. V just to not with me and I don't push you know I'm coaching let me know So my coaching I don't charge my agents anything Yeah, you know for coaching obviously Uh, yeah, so I give you two chances to work we can join me the xp or you can thank my coaching like every else Uh, and I'm not a I'm not a degree I see your I'm sure you would better recruit and I even with my brokerage I was never a recruiter Like I literally never I never picked up the phone once even with the xp I think I called two people And actually I've 22 other people now Uh, but I think I call two people So I'm just that's not who I am you know you live within who you are and have a contribution guy Let me help you get whatever you want Maybe you'll join me. Maybe you won If you do great you don't that's okay to have a good laugh I love it Mitch. Thank you on behalf of the audience you gave so many not just great actual tactical strategies But also ways to think about your life your business and you know Taking a hard look in the mirror and saying okay. What's not going well in my life right now and everyone's got something That's not going well in their life at all times The trick is to know what it is so if you know what it is you can work on it But you can't work on it if you don't have time and time is really what Mitch is aiming to give you back You want more time with your family your friends yourself You know volunteer opportunities. Whatever you want to do in life You need time to do that and this is a job that That can if you treat it like a job it can eat up your time if you treat it like your own business And you really run it like an entrepreneur then hopefully it will give you back more of that time And you can continue to make a good living Yeah, okay, so just one last thing I can talk all day Uh, I want your mindset to be you invested $250,000 in starting your real estate business not $1500 Nobody cares about $1500 Right, but if you invested $250,000 What would you do differently? I guarantee the word is everything Yeah, it's a great point. It's a great point So start now this is a great time with the NAR settlement point Sort of sort of pushing a lot of agents out because they're ones e2z agents. They're they're leaving I will tell you we have a holding company here for people that don't practice It's for the whole state of Illinois where the largest one in the state we have 1100 agents in there and we added 300 of them since the NAR settlement that is how quickly people are exiting So what a great thing for everyone listening because you can pick up their clients Prospect prospect prospect follow follow follow Mitch is the guy to learn how to do all of those things and run a successful business Along the way and maybe figure out how to compensate people like Mitch was doing where you're paying them a flat fee for various tasks You're you're focusing on the things you like and that are business building for you and you know Mitch is going to show you exactly how to do that check out the book the big live link to that in the show notes Mitch on behalf of everyone.
