[00:01:14] Today's episode is brought to you by corded.io.
[00:01:18] Are you looking for agents to join your brokerage or team?
[00:01:21] Now, as a real estate recruiter,
[00:01:23] I can tell you the answer is always yes.
[00:01:26] But most agents aren't looking to move right now.
[00:01:29] So how do you know who to contact?
[00:01:31] Well, what if I were to tell you there's a recruiting
[00:01:33] and retention tool powered by artificial intelligence
[00:01:36] that shows you exactly which agents in your local market
[00:01:39] are looking to leave their brokerage right now
[00:01:42] and which agents at your own firm are also looking to leave you?
[00:01:47] Now, I've been recruiting REALTORS for 15 years
[00:01:49] and I've hired over 2000 agents.
[00:01:52] I can tell you with no exaggeration,
[00:01:54] this is the tool I've been waiting for.
[00:01:56] Corded's AI looks for trends across dozens of variables
[00:01:59] for each agent in your market
[00:02:01] and shows you which agents they believe are likely to move.
[00:02:04] Not only does it do that,
[00:02:06] but corded's AI went and visited my recruiting website
[00:02:09] and read everything I offer.
[00:02:11] So now when I'm recruiting,
[00:02:12] corded's AI tells me exactly what to say
[00:02:15] based on that agent's needs and what my brokerage can offer.
[00:02:18] It even writes emails for me.
[00:02:21] I've never seen anything like it
[00:02:22] and I use it every single day.
[00:02:25] Now, if you are looking to grow your brokerage,
[00:02:28] corded.io is the best tool out there.
[00:02:30] Visit corded.io to schedule a demo again.

[00:04:33] Thank you to our sponsors for shooting that over to me.
[00:04:36] All right, let's get on to it.
[00:04:37] My conversation with Garrett Maroon.
[00:04:54] Best advice you've received in real estate.
[00:04:57] Best advice I've ever received in real estate is pick a path and stay there long enough
[00:05:02] until it works.
[00:05:04] Tell me more.
[00:05:06] I have been fortunate.
[00:05:08] I've sold 650 homes in the past 11 years, 100% by referral, never done an open house or
[00:05:12] cold call or made a door knock or any bottle lead ever.
[00:05:16] And not from here.
[00:05:17] I only had 40 people in my database and just was encouraged.
[00:05:20] Look, it'll work if you just keep going.
[00:05:22] And so I just kept going and I believed in their belief and paid off.
[00:05:27] Unreal.
[00:05:28] Amazing.
[00:05:29] Worst advice you've received in real estate.
[00:05:34] So many things, right?
[00:05:36] DJ, worst advice I've received was actually from a coach in that same vein as I had sold
[00:05:41] 50 houses my second year in the industry.
[00:05:44] I hired this coach and said, look, I don't want to sell more.
[00:05:47] I just want to go home.
[00:05:48] And at the end of the first call to you, she said, all right, here's your homework.
[00:05:51] She knew I'd never done any of these things.
[00:05:52] She said, here's your homework.
[00:05:53] You need to go cold call 300 people this week and door knock 150 doors.
[00:05:58] And that's your homework.
[00:05:59] And I said, I'm not going to do that.
[00:06:00] She said, Garrett, you're not going to succeed then.
[00:06:02] And I was thinking, I mean, I feel like I'm succeeding.
[00:06:04] I mean, the top 1% in this market.
[00:06:07] And so we get on the phone the next week, DJ, like, did you do your homework?
[00:06:11] No, I told you, I wasn't going to do my homework.
[00:06:13] It's like, Garrett, you're not going to succeed.
[00:06:14] You need to call 300 door knock 150.
[00:06:17] Anyways, that was the worst advice I've ever received, right?
[00:06:20] Is you need to look like everyone else to win.
[00:06:23] Totally untrue.
[00:06:24] That was the worst advice.
[00:06:25] And thank you for that, ignored it.
[00:06:27] But that was the worst advice I think I've ever been given.
[00:06:30] To thine own self be true, they say, right?
[00:06:32] That's right.
[00:06:32] That's right.
[00:06:33] I love it.
[00:06:34] Garrett Maroon is our guest today.
[00:06:35] Let me tell you more about Garrett.
[00:06:38] And this is going to be a really, really amazing conversation.
[00:06:41] Garrett's real estate story started really small, as he said.
[00:06:44] He had just 40 names in a database, which is basically nothing.
[00:06:49] And as a vision, he was fueled by the relationships over leads.
[00:06:54] He began fast forwarding 11 years.
[00:06:56] Now he's closed over 650 homes, as he said.
[00:06:58] In his second year, 50 closing on rail.
[00:07:01] But again, 100% by relationships.
[00:07:03] That's just unreal.
[00:07:05] He's the founder of two 10 Realty Group, which is a top 1% team
[00:07:08] in Southeast Virginia.
[00:07:10] And Garrett brings more than expertise.
[00:07:11] He leads with authenticity, heart, and a deep commitment
[00:07:14] to serving both clients and his team with excellence.
[00:07:17] But real estate really is just the beginning.
[00:07:19] Garrett co-founded the 210 Collective at eXp Realty,
[00:07:22] where faith and business meet in powerful ways.
[00:07:25] He also launched the Faithful Agent, which
[00:07:28] is a nonprofit and vibrant community for gospel-centered agents
[00:07:31] who want to grow not just their business,
[00:07:34] but their walk with Christ.
[00:07:35] And every week on the Faithful Agent podcast,
[00:07:38] Garrett shares talk and real strategy
[00:07:40] to help agents thrive at work without burning out at home.
[00:07:44] And in his book, The Balance Breakthrough,
[00:07:46] his message is very clear.
[00:07:48] You don't have to choose between success and your soul.
[00:07:50] You can win at work without losing at life.
[00:07:54] And so what's Garrett's superpower?
[00:07:56] He is helping agents make more money by staying true to who they are
[00:07:59] and also doing what they love at home.
[00:08:03] Garrett's world is full of laughter and life with his wife, Rachel.
[00:08:06] They have five amazing kids.
[00:08:07] He's deeply involved in his church, always ready with the dad joke,
[00:08:11] grounded in the belief that true success
[00:08:12] is built on relationships, faith, family, and business in that order.
[00:08:17] Garrett is our guest at GarrettMaroon.com, is where you find him.
[00:08:22] He has a new book coming out probably
[00:08:24] by the time you listen to this, called The Balance Breakthrough.
[00:08:28] And it is going to be a huge success like his last book.
[00:08:32] So check it out, you can go to GarrettMaroon.com
[00:08:34] and it's M-A-R-O-O-N, just like it sounds.
[00:08:37] We'll have a link to that, Garrett with two ours and two T's.
[00:08:39] We'll have a link in the show notes.
[00:08:41] But go there, pre-order the book,
[00:08:42] you get the audio download for free.
[00:08:45] And we're gonna talk all about the book today as well.
[00:08:48] Garrett, welcome to the show.
[00:08:49] Yeah, thanks, Steve Jobs.
[00:08:50] And they're thinking,
[00:08:51] my assistant wrote a really nice introduction for me.
[00:08:55] So thank you for reading that and thank you,
[00:08:57] Shalee for writing that.
[00:08:58] It's, I'm honored, man, I'm honored to be here.
[00:09:01] Authenticity is something that just,
[00:09:03] I can feel it on you and I can tell,
[00:09:07] and probably our audience already can feel that as well from you.
[00:09:10] And you are really somebody who is just willing to say,
[00:09:14] this is me, this is what I'm into, this is what I believe.
[00:09:18] And you can integrate some of those passions,
[00:09:22] which aren't necessarily real estate-related,
[00:09:26] but combining them, you're your faith
[00:09:28] and just other things that you do and doing nonprofits.
[00:09:32] Just, it's really impressive that you were able to build
[00:09:35] this brand, and I don't want to say brand,
[00:09:38] because that probably cheapens the idea of it,
[00:09:40] saying it that way, but it's really who you are.
[00:09:43] And I just think, what a cool, authentic business
[00:09:46] you must run.
[00:09:47] But I want to go all the way back to the beginning,
[00:09:48] because I want to hear how you started with 40 names
[00:09:51] and really not much hope, I would think, at that point.
[00:09:56] But you just, I mean, well, at least when you first started
[00:09:58] thinking like, how am I going to do this?
[00:10:00] What you did it, second year, 50 deals.
[00:10:02] So why real estate, how'd you get in?
[00:10:05] Yeah, so I got in because of my wife told me to do it.
[00:10:08] Right, I tried to listen to my wife.
[00:10:10] You're a good soldier, you do what you're talking about.
[00:10:12] That's right.
[00:10:13] And so, man, DJ, I was a assistant director of admission
[00:10:16] at the university here.
[00:10:18] And I was making 42 grand a year.
[00:10:21] My wife and I were married, didn't have kids at the time,
[00:10:22] but the goal was for her to come home when we had kids,
[00:10:25] thinking I can't do that on 42,000.
[00:10:28] So I was looking at other jobs, right?
[00:10:29] A standard W2, my parents are amazing,
[00:10:33] and that's what they taught me, right?
[00:10:34] You kind of work a job for 30 years, that's what we do.
[00:10:37] And my wife came along and said,
[00:10:39] I think you'd be really good at real estate.
[00:10:40] So, my parents tried to talk me out of it.
[00:10:43] A lot of friends tried to talk me out of it,
[00:10:45] but I just, honestly, I trusted my wife.
[00:10:47] You know, I think there's seasons
[00:10:48] where you got to borrow other people's belief,
[00:10:50] and that's what I did.
[00:10:51] So I borrowed her belief that I could do it.
[00:10:54] I love that.
[00:10:54] But we also agreed that if I didn't sell it home
[00:10:57] in three months, I'd quit, right?
[00:10:59] We had no concerts on.
[00:11:01] No concerts.
[00:11:02] Well, three months comes and goes, haven't sold a house.
[00:11:05] And I remember the conversation that night at dinner,
[00:11:08] and I'm telling her, I think, you know, I didn't know.
[00:11:10] I think I can figure this out.
[00:11:12] Can I have another three months and we agreed, thankfully.
[00:11:15] And so at five and a half months, finally made a sale.
[00:11:18] And honestly, the rest just,
[00:11:20] it really started to grow pretty rapidly.
[00:11:22] I had no idea that I was building underground,
[00:11:24] right, the root system was growing.
[00:11:26] I didn't know that because I didn't know what I didn't know.
[00:11:28] But then I started to see that effectiveness.
[00:11:31] So yeah, it was the belief of my wife,
[00:11:33] who said, I think you'd be good at it.
[00:11:34] It was the need to make more than $42,000 a year.
[00:11:38] And I just went for it.
[00:11:40] And I was literally what happened.
[00:11:41] I had no idea if I was gonna be good,
[00:11:43] didn't think that I was an entrepreneur
[00:11:45] until a year and a half in.
[00:11:46] You know, I still was like, I don't know what I'm doing.
[00:11:48] I'm just trying to survive and not fail.
[00:11:50] So yeah, it was a really interesting beginning.
[00:11:53] It definitely was, but I'm thankful for all the,
[00:11:55] you know, experience I had.
[00:11:57] And the fact that I'm still here
[00:11:58] and it continued to grow.
[00:11:59] Now they say necessity is the mother of invention, right?
[00:12:02] You just figure it out when you have to.
[00:12:04] And when you have someone to support
[00:12:06] and someone that you've committed to,
[00:12:09] and you know, you're part of the deal
[00:12:11] and you gotta pay in just like she's paying.
[00:12:14] And giving her the opportunity to, you know,
[00:12:17] to when you have kids to not have to go out there.
[00:12:20] And that is, that's it.
[00:12:22] Yeah, you people are, it's amazing what people can do.
[00:12:26] And you don't even have to know if you can.
[00:12:28] You just have to be almost in a situation
[00:12:30] where you have to do it.
[00:12:32] And it's like, you'll probably figure it out.
[00:12:34] And I'm 100%, yeah, I'm sorry, DJ.
[00:12:37] No, go ahead.
[00:12:38] Yeah, I was gonna say, I think that the way I described
[00:12:40] business now, right, is you walk into a pitch black room
[00:12:44] and they shut the door behind you.
[00:12:46] And there's one light switch, right?
[00:12:48] That's it.
[00:12:48] Just one light switch you gotta find.
[00:12:50] There's furniture and all kinds of stuff in that room.
[00:12:52] You're gonna bump into it.
[00:12:53] You're gonna get hurt.
[00:12:53] There's gonna be all those things.
[00:12:54] But if you stay in that room long enough,
[00:12:56] you'll find the switch.
[00:12:57] I mean, there is no other option.
[00:12:59] If you're just there long enough, you'll find it.
[00:13:01] And so that's, you know, these are things
[00:13:04] I didn't understand at the time.
[00:13:05] But because we said what about another three months,
[00:13:08] it gave me time to find the light switch.
[00:13:10] If I'd given up, never would have found it,
[00:13:12] would have assumed, as not the room for me,
[00:13:14] I'm gonna quit.
[00:13:15] And who knows what would have happened, right?
[00:13:16] The ripple effect of just the continuing to look
[00:13:20] for that switch changed my entire life, right?
[00:13:23] It's gonna change my kids' life.
[00:13:25] So that's my, you know, I'm so passionate about,
[00:13:27] especially newer agents, it's hard.
[00:13:29] It's going to be hard, still hard for me now.
[00:13:31] But the reality is if you just stay long enough,
[00:13:34] you'll find the switch.
[00:13:35] And so the only question is, are you gonna give up?
[00:13:37] And if you're unwilling to give up, you'll find it.
[00:13:39] And you'll figure it out and it'll change everything.
[00:13:43] I couldn't say it better myself.
[00:13:45] I agree a hundred and 20%.
[00:13:47] It is absolutely the truth.
[00:13:49] And really it's all about just putting the blinders on
[00:13:52] and not looking for the results right away.
[00:13:55] And in fact, probably not looking for the results at all.
[00:13:58] And just going, I, smarter people than me have done this
[00:14:02] or even dumber people than me have done this.
[00:14:04] And so it's like, I just have to follow the path
[00:14:06] that's pretty well been, you know, trodden before.
[00:14:09] And it's not like you're, you're forging a brand new thing
[00:14:12] that nobody's ever done and you're not sure.
[00:14:14] Oh no, millions of people have done it.
[00:14:16] So it's kind of like, just this,
[00:14:18] I just have to trust that it's all gonna work out
[00:14:20] and hard work pays off.
[00:14:22] And especially in this career, it really does.
[00:14:25] And it's one of the most fair industries I know.
[00:14:29] And, you know, because it really,
[00:14:31] there is a positive correlation between the amount
[00:14:34] of work you put in and the results you get.
[00:14:36] But you have to be willing to wait for those seeds
[00:14:38] to germinate, like you said, and you're not gonna see
[00:14:41] what's happening under the soil.
[00:14:42] And it's going to feel like failure for a long time.
[00:14:46] And it does.
[00:14:46] But that's how everything is, isn't it?
[00:14:48] Like every time I go to the gym and I do,
[00:14:52] well, today I had to do these really difficult pushups.
[00:14:55] And every time I do them, it's not like there's any part
[00:14:58] of me that's like, this is easy, this is great,
[00:15:00] this is fun.
[00:15:01] Like it all is awful and painful and it hurts.
[00:15:05] But it's like, it's kind of supposed to
[00:15:06] and that's the point of it.
[00:15:08] And it's like, that's the only way the muscles get stronger
[00:15:11] is you have to break them apart.
[00:15:13] You literally rip them apart.
[00:15:14] And in order to do that, you got to be willing to sort of go,
[00:15:17] I'm gonna like be standing in the pathway of pain.
[00:15:20] And that's kind of how it is for most things that are worthwhile.
[00:15:23] Maybe everything is worthwhile.
[00:15:25] So like you got to just put the energy and time into it
[00:15:27] and trust that like this is good for me.
[00:15:29] Yeah.
[00:15:30] We'll work out.
[00:15:31] And it almost, I found it in life,
[00:15:33] at least in this country.
[00:15:34] I mean, look, I can't speak for every,
[00:15:36] there's lots of places where things aren't very fair.
[00:15:39] And there's a lot of unfairness here too,
[00:15:42] but there's a lot of fairness.
[00:15:43] And if you put your mind to it,
[00:15:46] it almost doesn't matter what your background is
[00:15:48] in this business.
[00:15:49] Like you can make your way.
[00:15:51] People don't really care where you come from.
[00:15:53] They just care if you care about them
[00:15:55] and you're gonna do a good job
[00:15:57] and you're gonna meet their needs.
[00:15:58] Like that's pretty much it.
[00:15:59] Yeah, I love that.
[00:16:00] It's very fair, I think, this business.
[00:16:03] It's so true.
[00:16:04] I mean, that is such a good point, right?
[00:16:06] I can end of the day, anybody,
[00:16:09] I'll give you an example, right?
[00:16:10] So for a while, we had a coaching company.
[00:16:12] We were giving out the playbook, if you will,
[00:16:14] and like what to do every month
[00:16:15] to grow your business by relationships.
[00:16:17] I get a call, this a couple years ago, DJ,
[00:16:19] I get a call from this agent.
[00:16:21] And she's like, hey, I need to cancel.
[00:16:23] And it's not working for me.
[00:16:24] Hey, totally understanding.
[00:16:24] Can you tell me why?
[00:16:25] Because it's worked for a lot of agents, right?
[00:16:27] And she's like, well, it's,
[00:16:28] I wasn't getting the traction, whatever, whatever.
[00:16:31] And come to find out, she finally admits,
[00:16:32] as well, I actually didn't do it.
[00:16:34] And I'm like, all right, so you don't know it didn't work.
[00:16:36] You just didn't work it, right?
[00:16:38] How are you blaming what I'm doing?
[00:16:40] To your point, it's fair.
[00:16:41] If you do the work, you'll get the result.
[00:16:44] I don't know how fast it'll come.
[00:16:46] And I don't know how big the result will be,
[00:16:47] but I do know what's gonna happen.
[00:16:49] Because it always happens, that's the way this works.
[00:16:52] So you're right, it's very fair.
[00:16:54] Show me what you've done in the past three months.
[00:16:55] I'll show you what your business looks like.
[00:16:58] It's the, I love that.
[00:16:59] Never heard you might say it's the fairest industry.
[00:17:01] It really is though.
[00:17:02] You're 100% right about that.
[00:17:03] It's certainly one of them.
[00:17:04] And it's commensurate with the amount of work.
[00:17:07] Whereas, you know, other careers where you're a salary
[00:17:10] to employ, maybe it's fair, maybe it isn't.
[00:17:13] There's, you don't have a ton of control,
[00:17:14] maybe about that.
[00:17:15] But certainly, this is one where there seems to be,
[00:17:19] you know, a level, a somewhat of a level playing ground.
[00:17:21] Or at least as level as it maybe could be.
[00:17:24] And I think that's what's really neat is,
[00:17:26] you know, I go to the NAR conference I didn't this year,
[00:17:29] but you go and you see all different kinds of people.
[00:17:32] It's like nobody, people don't even look the same.
[00:17:34] You know, everyone looks different and you go,
[00:17:35] oh, that's so cool that everybody could just be themselves
[00:17:38] and they can figure out a pathway.
[00:17:40] And here they all are and they've all made it.
[00:17:42] And it's like, that is pretty cool.
[00:17:45] 
[00:17:45] Yeah.
[00:17:46] Well, let's, let's talk a little bit about your faith
[00:17:49] because I think this is such an interesting thing.
[00:17:51] I rarely talk to agents who put that front and center
[00:17:55] in their business.
[00:17:56] And I think I was talking to you about this sort of before we started.
[00:17:59] And I think what I thought was really amazing.
[00:18:02] I was really thinking about this because I was going,
[00:18:04] okay, so I live in the city where people keep that sort of things
[00:18:08] like religion and politics.
[00:18:09] You almost have to at least here in Chicago.
[00:18:12] You have to be really careful about what you say
[00:18:13] because people are really judgy here.
[00:18:15] There's a lot of judgment.
[00:18:16] And if you think differently from then the norm is people get kind
[00:18:19] of weird about it.
[00:18:19] But, but that being said, and people are just judgy
[00:18:23] about religion and politics anyway.
[00:18:24] But the point is, is I was thinking,
[00:18:27] do I, like I'm thinking about if I was really,
[00:18:32] if I was super religious, I was thinking,
[00:18:35] okay, if I went to this thing, like for example,
[00:18:38] I play tennis.
[00:18:41] And so I think about the people I play tennis with,
[00:18:43] real kind of similar, like maybe we have different careers
[00:18:47] and we have different family lives and whatever.
[00:18:49] But we all kind of love tennis in the same way.
[00:18:51] And I was thinking, you know, the cool part about
[00:18:54] with putting religion that's really important to you
[00:18:58] into your business is it's such a way of life.
[00:19:02] A religion is a way of life for people.
[00:19:03] It's a guideline for how to live and how to see the world.
[00:19:07] And what I love about it is, you know, I would assume
[00:19:11] and you'll tell me if this is accurate,
[00:19:12] is that you're going to attract people
[00:19:15] who have a very similar worldview
[00:19:17] and a very similar outlook on life
[00:19:19] and kind of go through the same experiences.
[00:19:22] And I think that probably creates just a lot of intimacy
[00:19:25] and a lot of like instant connection.
[00:19:28] So if you're mind sharing about that,
[00:19:29] I'd love to hear.
[00:19:30] Of course, yeah, absolutely.
[00:19:31] First we got to get you into pickleball.
[00:19:33] That's the new thing, DJ.
[00:19:35] I was just telling you.
[00:19:36] As tennis players, we do not like pickleball,
[00:19:38] but I know that everybody loves pickleball.
[00:19:41] I'm not picking on you pickleball people.
[00:19:43] The thing, us brackets towards people,
[00:19:45] we're just glad you're doing it.
[00:19:47] So please keep doing that.
[00:19:48] Love it, love it.
[00:19:49] No, so now, and I appreciate the question.
[00:19:51] I mean, I think for anybody, right,
[00:19:53] I'm huge into authenticity.
[00:19:55] And so I'll just grab it this way
[00:19:57] and then certainly answer the question.
[00:19:58] But a couple of weeks ago, I was on a podcast
[00:20:00] and the gentleman beforehand said,
[00:20:02] hey, we know you're the Christian agent guy,
[00:20:04] like you have the faith, I don't know these things,
[00:20:05] but that's not this show.
[00:20:06] If you don't mind, just don't talk about it.
[00:20:08] And I said, well, yeah, and I said,
[00:20:11] and I said, look, this is your show.
[00:20:12] I respect that.
[00:20:14] But it's not a backpack that I take on and off.
[00:20:16] Like this is who I am.
[00:20:18] And so I can't not be that.
[00:20:20] If it doesn't work for your audience, I respect that.
[00:20:23] Like I'm happy not to do this episode, right?
[00:20:24] I'm not gonna offend him.
[00:20:26] And he was like, no, I was doing it
[00:20:27] and we had a great conversation.
[00:20:28] But for anyone, right, they don't have to agree
[00:20:30] with what I believe that's okay.
[00:20:32] But for anybody to say, you don't need,
[00:20:35] you're not sometimes an agent, you know,
[00:20:38] I'm not sometimes an agent, sometimes a dad,
[00:20:40] sometimes a husband, sometimes a follower of Jesus.
[00:20:43] Like I'm all of those things all the time.
[00:20:44] And so whenever I show up, I should show up as that.
[00:20:47] This is just who I am.
[00:20:48] And if anything, the easiest thing to do
[00:20:50] is show up and be me.
[00:20:51] It's supposed to, wait, who am I supposed to be
[00:20:53] in this moment?
[00:20:54] That's exhausting.
[00:20:55] And, you know, I can't do that perfectly.
[00:20:57] And so for anybody, right, I want them to be encouraged.
[00:21:01] Just like this is who I am.
[00:21:02] And yeah, are you gonna repel some people?
[00:21:04] You sure you will.
[00:21:05] Are you gonna attract some others?
[00:21:07] Of course you will.
[00:21:07] That's great.
[00:21:08] And the people that come have already made a decision.
[00:21:11] I know who this person is.
[00:21:13] And I wanna work with him.
[00:21:14] Fantastic, right?
[00:21:15] It's part of letting, you know,
[00:21:17] part of your job is to be super clear about this.
[00:21:19] Is who I serve in this.
[00:21:20] So I don't, what I have found DJ though,
[00:21:22] that's interesting is when we went all in on that brand, right?
[00:21:27] And we just, because that's, they already knew that
[00:21:29] so we were, right?
[00:21:30] We just made it more clear.
[00:21:31] When we went all on that brand, I have a ton of clients
[00:21:36] and past clients in my devs who don't are not Christians
[00:21:39] and they don't disagree, you know, agree with that.
[00:21:41] And they're totally fine with it, right?
[00:21:43] We have a lot of people who the world would say
[00:21:45] are hardcore anti-Christian.
[00:21:48] And they come because they wanna get support
[00:21:50] and they know we're gonna treat them fairly.
[00:21:51] And so, you know, we're all, we'll serve anybody.
[00:21:54] Anybody deserves to be cared for and loved well.
[00:21:57] And so what's been interesting is it both sets
[00:22:00] a standard of service that they expect, which is good
[00:22:03] because it owns us accountable, right?
[00:22:05] And it layers levels the playing field.
[00:22:08] Excuse me to say, this is who I am.
[00:22:10] This is how we're gonna treat you.
[00:22:11] If I say we're gonna pray about this deal,
[00:22:13] you're not weirded out by that because you,
[00:22:15] I mean, what else did you expect I was gonna do, right?
[00:22:17] And we're gonna really try to show up and love you well
[00:22:19] because there's something greater going on here
[00:22:21] than just you buying a house.
[00:22:23] And so it sets the tone for what's about to happen.
[00:22:27] And it's been really freeing too, right?
[00:22:29] Again, I was never shy about it to begin with,
[00:22:31] but now it's like this, just who we are,
[00:22:34] the whole thing is branded that way, right?
[00:22:36] Now I have the Faithful Agent podcast and nonprofit
[00:22:39] for Christians in real estate.
[00:22:41] It's pretty clear who I am, right?
[00:22:44] And who specifically I feel like I need to serve.
[00:22:46] Doesn't mean I don't wanna help somebody else,
[00:22:47] but I'm just being honest about who I am.
[00:22:49] And if that's not you, it's okay.
[00:22:51] So I do want people to realize and see that in our industry,
[00:22:55] right, you're told, don't talk about politics,
[00:22:56] don't talk about religion.
[00:22:58] I definitely don't think talking about politics
[00:22:59] is the greatest idea ever, right?
[00:23:01] But with your religion, if like this is who I am,
[00:23:04] I would say you should talk about it.
[00:23:07] Even if you disagree with me, that's okay.
[00:23:09] We should be able to have those conversations.
[00:23:10] I should be able to do a deal with someone who's like,
[00:23:12] I totally disagree with everything you stand for.
[00:23:14] That's fine.
[00:23:15] Let's do this deal together, right?
[00:23:17] I'd love to hear you out.
[00:23:18] You hear me out.
[00:23:18] That's okay.
[00:23:19] We can have a relationship.
[00:23:21] So I think if more agents were just honest
[00:23:23] about who they were, stop trying to be
[00:23:25] what the industry told them to be
[00:23:27] and started to be themselves, they'd burn out less.
[00:23:30] That's definitely true.
[00:23:31] Number one, and they just have a better business.
[00:23:33] Why?
[00:23:33] Because when you show up and you're authentic,
[00:23:35] you're gonna show up more naturally.
[00:23:36] You're gonna show up more often,
[00:23:37] and you're naturally gonna wanna do it better.
[00:23:39] And I think if we did that,
[00:23:41] we'd build a bigger, better business
[00:23:42] and a bigger, better life.
[00:23:44] I think that when you have the courage to be authentic,
[00:23:48] which by the way is not easy.
[00:23:51] We, I think that's important.
[00:23:53] Yeah.
[00:23:53] I wanna go back to something,
[00:23:55] and I wanna then come back to this thought.
[00:23:57] But as we were talking about showing up with you,
[00:24:01] it's faith is one of the pillars of kind of your life.
[00:24:05] And I was thinking, we don't ask people who are gay.
[00:24:09] We don't say, don't be gay while you're a real-said agent.
[00:24:11] Like don't make that your identity.
[00:24:14] It's like, no, no, we encourage, it's like, of course,
[00:24:16] it's inclusion.
[00:24:17] Everybody should be who they are.
[00:24:19] And it's funny, but we do that sort of with religion,
[00:24:22] don't we?
[00:24:22] We sort of say, like, you're gonna, and it's funny too.
[00:24:25] I think about this with politics a lot.
[00:24:27] I always try to remember that you really want
[00:24:31] about half the country thinking one way
[00:24:32] and the other half thinking the other way
[00:24:34] because it keeps us very honest.
[00:24:36] That's like you look both sides going,
[00:24:38] the other side's wrong.
[00:24:39] And that's good for democracy because it sort of keeps us
[00:24:43] on the straight and narrow.
[00:24:44] But I love this idea of, you're right.
[00:24:47] It's like, once you figure out, this is who I am,
[00:24:49] this is important to me.
[00:24:51] And I'm not going to, you know, you're not here to
[00:24:55] prophletize, you are here to just say, this is my identity.
[00:24:58] And I think you're right, it does sort of suggest
[00:25:01] a certain level of care and also some values.
[00:25:04] And, you know, some really positive things
[00:25:07] that people associate or some people associate.
[00:25:11] And you're right, maybe other people don't.
[00:25:12] And that's fine because there's lots of people
[00:25:15] that are going to want that.
[00:25:17] And again, it is, I think the courage to show up as you are
[00:25:21] while it takes courage, it really tremendous courage.
[00:25:25] It ends up really rewarding you, like you said,
[00:25:29] because people see that and they go, that's courageous.
[00:25:32] Whether they agree with it or not,
[00:25:34] they're like, that's impressive because people,
[00:25:36] a lot of us, we have the masks we put on and the things we hide
[00:25:39] and the things we go, well, this is really what I'm into,
[00:25:42] but I don't really want people to know about it.
[00:25:43] For whatever reason we're afraid of judgment or shame
[00:25:46] being shamed or whatever.
[00:25:48] And it's like, okay, fine, maybe there's some things
[00:25:49] you don't share with everyone.
[00:25:51] But this idea that you can just be yourself
[00:25:54] and run a business is really pretty impressive
[00:25:58] in this industry.
[00:25:59] And I've seen all sorts of different types of people
[00:26:01] who I've interviewed people on the show who are like new agey
[00:26:05] and into sort of the crystal thing and sort of more,
[00:26:08] more like not as traditional,
[00:26:11] sort of even kind of wackier things.
[00:26:14] And they don't tremendously successful.
[00:26:16] And then there's the ex-athletes who work with athletes
[00:26:19] and everyone's different.
[00:26:20] And I just think it is so cool that you are willing to do that.
[00:26:25] And I think it activates something in other people.
[00:26:29] It's kind of like, I've noticed this when I started volunteering
[00:26:32] like a long time ago.
[00:26:33] I just thought it was kind of the right thing to do
[00:26:35] and I got involved and started supporting this particular organization.
[00:26:38] And I thought, oh, I just felt like I should probably do that.
[00:26:42] And then when I would tell, I wouldn't really tell people
[00:26:44] but they would find out I did it.
[00:26:45] And they would go like, oh, I wish I would do that.
[00:26:47] And I go, but you can go do that.
[00:26:48] Like it's not that big of a deal.
[00:26:50] 
[00:26:51] But what I would do is would activate in them this need
[00:26:55] that they're like, oh, I should be more doing that.
[00:26:58] And so I think with your brand in particular around this,
[00:27:01] I think it's like, oh, yeah, I should be more authentic.
[00:27:03] I think you're going to get a lot of people
[00:27:05] who just are impressed by that.
[00:27:07] And I think so again, my hat's off to you.
[00:27:10] Let's talk.
[00:27:10] I want to talk about the podcast.
[00:27:12] And then I want to talk about the book.
[00:27:13] So the podcast is the faithful agent podcast.
[00:27:16] Tell us what it is and who it's for.
[00:27:19] Yeah.
[00:27:20] So it's for Christians in real estate, right?
[00:27:22] So it was started at DJ five and a half years ago
[00:27:25] as serving not selling.
[00:27:26] So I was talking about building your business
[00:27:28] by relationships, right?
[00:27:29] Which is really my heart and all of the things.
[00:27:31] My the story is so my mom passed away in October 2022
[00:27:34] from breast cancer.
[00:27:36] And those next three months, I mean,
[00:27:38] they were really hard for me transparently.
[00:27:40] And it just caused me to stop and ask the Lord, right?
[00:27:43] And just pray like, who do you want me to serve?
[00:27:45] And what I what I realized was no one was specifically
[00:27:48] talking to Christians in real estate, right?
[00:27:51] Like no one was doing it.
[00:27:53] And I went looking for it.
[00:27:54] That's how I found that.
[00:27:54] That's how I realized no one was doing it, right?
[00:27:56] It's like, I want to hear that because I need something different, right?
[00:27:59] I want the real estate.
[00:28:00] I definitely do.
[00:28:01] But I'm in the season of grieving.
[00:28:03] Like I need them to talk to my heart too.
[00:28:05] And it couldn't find it.
[00:28:07] And so me and a buddy, my best friend Tyler
[00:28:10] who was co-host of the podcast at the time,
[00:28:12] we said, all right, let's just go all in then.
[00:28:14] Like we don't know what's going to happen.
[00:28:15] Let's just go all in.
[00:28:16] If we're looking for it, I bet there's other people looking for it.
[00:28:19] And so in January of 23, we went all in and said,
[00:28:21] we're going to do the faithful agent podcast.
[00:28:23] We started doing conferences.
[00:28:25] We launched them on profit, right?
[00:28:26] We just kind of went for it.
[00:28:28] And you know, it was amazing, DJ,
[00:28:29] because I think the way I describe it is,
[00:28:32] I've raised a lot of flags in my life, right?
[00:28:34] For different businesses or other things.
[00:28:36] No one ever cared except me, right?
[00:28:39] In my wife, if I actually made money doing it.
[00:28:41] But when we raised this flag, it was amazing.
[00:28:44] This is again, the call to authenticity.
[00:28:46] When I raised this flag, it was amazing.
[00:28:48] How many people reached out?
[00:28:49] I was like, man, I was waiting for something like this.
[00:28:51] Oh gosh, I didn't know I could talk
[00:28:53] about my face so openly.
[00:28:54] Thank you for doing this.
[00:28:55] I'm like, I'm not doing anything other than
[00:28:57] to try to be myself.
[00:28:58] And there are so many other people, right,
[00:29:00] that are looking for a Christian real estate.
[00:29:02] There are so many other people that are looking for
[00:29:04] whatever real estate, right?
[00:29:06] That when we stay quiet,
[00:29:08] everyone else feels like they're alone.
[00:29:10] And so what we realized was, you know,
[00:29:13] I'll just be out loud, you know, whatever.
[00:29:14] If I take flag for it, I don't really care, right?
[00:29:16] Because I'm not, I'm just being myself, whatever.
[00:29:18] If you don't like me, I get it.
[00:29:19] Not everybody's going to like me.
[00:29:21] But what we didn't realize was how encouraging it was
[00:29:24] to so many, literally thousands of agents
[00:29:27] who are just, man, thank you, because this is what we need.
[00:29:30] This is what we are looking for.
[00:29:32] And no one was specifically talking to us, right?
[00:29:35] Because there's a lot of us who get,
[00:29:37] I get what it's like being a real estate agent.
[00:29:38] So do you, right?
[00:29:39] But there's not a lot of people who get what it's like
[00:29:41] being a Christian real estate agent, right?
[00:29:43] You understand your business and your heart.
[00:29:45] And in any scenario, again, whatever is authentic to you,
[00:29:48] there's not a lot of people who understand, you know, real estate
[00:29:52] and struggling, uh, uh, whatever with addiction, right?
[00:29:55] Whatever it is, like, whatever is going on with you,
[00:29:58] there's other people that wish they could just hear the truth
[00:30:01] and the authentic message that you have to have and say,
[00:30:04] this is how you build a business while you're struggling with whatever.
[00:30:07] Or while this is your acting, it doesn't matter.
[00:30:09] We need to go first.
[00:30:11] Someone's got to be brave enough to go first.
[00:30:13] And I promise if you do, there are so many people that will say,
[00:30:16] I'm so glad you did that.
[00:30:18] I've been waiting for someone to do X, Y, and Z.
[00:30:20] So it's been an incredible journey so far.
[00:30:23] It's amazing.
[00:30:24] You just gave me an idea, well, not me an idea,
[00:30:26] but this idea that the recovering agent podcast,
[00:30:30] somebody who was recovered from addiction or at least
[00:30:33] is in recovery.
[00:30:35] Boy, that would be, I mean, that affects like 10% of the population.
[00:30:39] Like that is so many people and nobody's talking to that person.
[00:30:43] For real.
[00:30:44] You know, that's boy, that's another.
[00:30:46] Somebody needs to start that podcast.
[00:30:48] Here's what they do.
[00:30:49] Because of the end of the day, we need community.
[00:30:53] Like forever, whatever our tribe is, we need community.
[00:30:58] It's, we're biologically hardwired for community.
[00:31:01] And we need interpersonal effectiveness or interpersonal interactions.
[00:31:05] And with our phones, they take us largely away from that.
[00:31:09] And so, and that's, I'm not here to say phones are bad,
[00:31:12] but that's just kind of what the phones are designed to do.
[00:31:15] And so, okay, so we need places where people can go and congregate,
[00:31:19] be in community and be like, these are my people.
[00:31:22] And it's really, really good for us.
[00:31:24] And that's, that's, that's a great call to arms,
[00:31:28] pardon, pardon the sort of military expression.
[00:31:32] But this is really a great call to action for people
[00:31:34] who are thinking like, I'm into this thing.
[00:31:37] And I know other people are into it.
[00:31:39] And maybe I could create this community.
[00:31:40] And we can all support each other.
[00:31:42] You know, that is one of them.
[00:31:43] Yeah. And the moms in real estate do a phone nominal job, right, DJ?
[00:31:47] And they have, they have got that, they figured that out a long time ago.
[00:31:51] Yeah.
[00:31:52] And then things out in Florida.
[00:31:54] Right. And I love that.
[00:31:55] But it's like, put there's others.
[00:31:56] You know, I'm coaching right now an agent who's growing out the widowed agent community.
[00:32:00] Oh, right.
[00:32:01] He was widowed.
[00:32:02] And it's like, but you know, I, as much as I love agents and I love this agent,
[00:32:07] right, I don't get it, right?
[00:32:09] Like, I don't fully get it.
[00:32:10] I don't know what's going on.
[00:32:11] I've never experienced that.
[00:32:13] And so to your point, like we need to have those joint experiences
[00:32:16] where someone can say like, you really get how hard it is, right?
[00:32:20] Or I've coached a single mom before, right?
[00:32:22] Her husband left and she has four kids trying to build a business.
[00:32:25] Like, yes, I can teach you business principles.
[00:32:28] Yes, I care about what's going on with you.
[00:32:29] I'm going to try my best to do that.
[00:32:31] But what I really want you to do is go get coached by a single woman who is crushing it,
[00:32:36] who really gets it, right?
[00:32:37] There's just so much more to us than just being agents that we need, you know,
[00:32:42] and someone's got to go first.
[00:32:44] And I get that we're afraid of those things.
[00:32:46] Like I totally understand, you know, I've helped agents DJ build.
[00:32:49] I was teaching at this, this pretty large brokerage one day.
[00:32:51] And I started talking about building affinity groups, right?
[00:32:53] To grow your business.
[00:32:55] And one of the biggest agents there is like, well, you know, I'm just a mom
[00:32:58] and I don't really do a lot of stuff.
[00:33:00] Just a mom.
[00:33:01] Yeah.
[00:33:01] And I was like, well, first of all, I don't, I don't believe you, right?
[00:33:04] And so I said, what do the things you love?
[00:33:06] And she's like, I don't want to tell you.
[00:33:07] And I was like, tell me, she said, I love crime podcasts and I love wine.
[00:33:11] And I said, okay, hold on.
[00:33:13] How many women in here?
[00:33:15] Yes, millions and millions of people do that.
[00:33:17] And I'm like, why would you not just say, I'm going to start a group
[00:33:21] for any local mom who loves crime podcasts and wine, you know, once a month, whatever,
[00:33:25] come hang out, we'll just have fun together.
[00:33:27] She did it.
[00:33:28] Guess what?
[00:33:29] Not only did she love it, her business group because of it,
[00:33:32] because they want to work with people that are like them, right?
[00:33:35] And so when you're honest about who you are, they're like, why would they ever come to me
[00:33:40] if they're like, I love this lady, right?
[00:33:42] We go to her house, we listen to crap, that's because we have wine together, that's fun.
[00:33:46] That's, they get me.
[00:33:47] They're like me.
[00:33:48] Everybody needs that to your point.
[00:33:50] And so I think if we just stop being so afraid of like, let me just be honest about
[00:33:54] some of the things about me, our business would grow, our enjoyment would grow, right?
[00:33:59] And then we'd be able to show up better for everybody else in our life because we're like,
[00:34:02] I actually like some, it's still hard, but I actually like part of my day, right?
[00:34:07] As opposed to grinding it out all the time.
[00:34:09] So I just, there's a huge cause, just be authentic.
[00:34:11] It's okay.
[00:34:12] It's good.
[00:34:13] There's other people just like you.
[00:34:14] And it's a good thing, right?
[00:34:16] Someone needs to go first.
[00:34:17] And so if you're brave enough to go first, it's going to change your life too.
[00:34:20] And there's, and you know, I just highly, highly encourage that.
[00:34:24] And it opens up the, it opens up the ability for someone else maybe to say,
[00:34:30] I can step into my authenticity because that person did it.
[00:34:34] And it's really, it's what they say about intimacy.
[00:34:37] It's that somebody has to be vulnerable and tell their hard truth to another person.
[00:34:42] And what it does is it opens up the space for the other person to go,
[00:34:45] oh, it gives a permission to be like, oh, no, I can tell you about all my hard things.
[00:34:49] Yes, right.
[00:34:49] It's really scary and it's hard because that person could hurt you with that information and they
[00:34:53] could run away or they could, you know, that's, that's the reality of, of relationships.
[00:34:57] But most people don't do that.
[00:34:59] They actually find it so endearing because they go, oh, I need somebody to talk to about things too.
[00:35:03] So you're talking about the same thing.
[00:35:05] And I think it's just what a great, what a great reminder for all of us listening is,
[00:35:11] is don't hide who you are and you will find your tribe.
[00:35:15] Let's talk about the new book.
[00:35:16] So the breakthrough broke, the breakthrough broker.
[00:35:19] Oh, sorry, the balance breakthrough.
[00:35:21] Sorry, yeah, yeah.
[00:35:22] I belong to a, I support a men's organization and we have what's called breakthrough weekends.
[00:35:27] And so I've got breakthrough in my mind and it's a totally different thing because for 20 years,
[00:35:31] I can just talk about breakthrough weekends.
[00:35:33] Yeah, yeah.
[00:35:33] My apologies.
[00:35:33] The balance breakthrough is the book and it's coming out next week, although by the time you hear
[00:35:37] that it'll be this week.
[00:35:38] So it's available everywhere.
[00:35:41] Books are sold and online and we'll have a link to the Amazon, you know, in the show notes.
[00:35:46] But tell us about the book and what it's for.
[00:35:48] Yeah, so thanks, DJ.
[00:35:49] So I wrote this book.
[00:35:51] It's two years in the making, right?
[00:35:53] And really first and foremost, I wrote it hoping to restore the entrepreneurs family, right?
[00:35:58] Like I think of the kids of agents everywhere who are missing out on mommy and daddy time
[00:36:04] because the business is running them ragged.
[00:36:07] And so when I was coaching, that was my heart, right?
[00:36:10] For me, that was my heart.
[00:36:12] And so I'll just go quick breakdown, right?
[00:36:14] So part one of the book is all about redefining success on our own terms.
[00:36:18] So, you know, I found for me, I was building a business.
[00:36:21] I had a big team.
[00:36:23] I was doing all the things we had three kids.
[00:36:25] And then I realized like I had created this business that was crushing it.
[00:36:29] But it was taking me like 50, 60 hours a week.
[00:36:32] And so would I actually be most proud of the guy who figured out how to work less and make
[00:36:35] the same amount of money and spend more time with my kids?
[00:36:38] Or the guy who would double his business but work more and make more money but see his kids less?
[00:36:44] Like that was a really obvious answer.
[00:36:45] And then I started to wonder, well, why was I even doing what I was doing?
[00:36:49] And I came up, so my whiteboards literally to my left, I came up stairs DJ and I realized the
[00:36:54] only thing written on my whiteboard that I was measuring, number of deals, GCI and volume,
[00:36:59] right? That was it.
[00:37:00] And so it's like, okay, no wonder I'm adding agents, no wonder I'm doing this, no wonder I'm
[00:37:05] doing that. Because the only way I think I'm I can measure success is what the industry told me
[00:37:10] was success. How many deals did you do, right? How much money did you make?
[00:37:13] So it's a call to us to reset and redefine what success actually looks like to me.
[00:37:20] And so now my scoreboard is, yeah, a profit goal, but a wife goal and a kid goal.
[00:37:24] So like, a kid goal is every seventh week off, right?
[00:37:27] And now I have a new way to keep score. It's as simple as someone recently asked me,
[00:37:32] you know, how do you sell 30 homes a year? What would you tell that agent?
[00:37:35] And I said honestly, I tell them that's a bad question because it's easy.
[00:37:38] Go work 120 hours a week and spend 100K. You'll figure it out, right?
[00:37:42] Like, I think what you mean is, right? Which is where as agents we need to get to.
[00:37:46] I think what you mean is, you know, how do I sell 30 homes this year?
[00:37:49] Never miss a family dinner, right? And all and be able to coach my son, Socrates team.
[00:37:54] Whatever that scenario is, you've got to ask a better question, which really comes from,
[00:37:58] what am I actually trying to achieve? So that's really part one, right? It just stems from,
[00:38:02] so again, when I lost my mom, you recognize you look and you say there's a date, a dash,
[00:38:07] in a date. And the dash was her entire life. And her headstone doesn't say,
[00:38:12] French teachers, she wasn't a real estate agent, right? But it wouldn't say sold 100
[00:38:16] ounces, right? 5 million GC at whatever. It wouldn't say those things. It would talk about her
[00:38:20] character, who she loved, who she spent time with. So if that's true, is that what we're building?
[00:38:25] Or are we just trying to make the industry happy? So that's part one.
[00:38:29] Part two is then trying to equip the agent to do that. So teaching what I call the PDA formula,
[00:38:34] right? Just because I wanted people to think of like, you're holding hands, that's gross, right?
[00:38:38] The public display of affection. But it's how do you build a predictable dollar productive or
[00:38:43] profitable business that guess what aligns with who you are? And so there's so much in there of,
[00:38:49] you know, I want you to be, so my wife's best family friends, the Jensen's, you'll appreciate
[00:38:55] this DJ. The dad is six foot 10. I'm five six and three quarters. And when you're five six,
[00:39:00] the three quarters matters, right? And so I remember visiting Mr. Jensen and he was like,
[00:39:05] yeah, I want you to show, I want to show you my sports memorabilia in my office. And like,
[00:39:09] when I went in super cool, what I remember though is Mr. Jensen works at a standing desk. I could
[00:39:15] walk back and forth under it without ducking, right? Like how is how are we the same human? That
[00:39:20] doesn't make sense. And so if I spent, and this is where I fear most agents are, if I spent my time
[00:39:26] saying, why am I not tall like him? If I was tall like him, I could have played basketball,
[00:39:31] I could have done this good and that whatever. We spend so much time there as opposed to, I bet I
[00:39:36] would crush him and hide and seek. There's no way he's going to hide at six dead, right? Right?
[00:39:42] If I paid attention to what I am uniquely gifted in and then went and tried to be excellent at that,
[00:39:47] so much is going to be better. So the PDA formula really centers around what is an alignment. And then
[00:39:52] how do you turn that into a predictable, profitable business? And then finally, it's really about part
[00:39:57] three is the intentional achievement. So I teach what I call the rule of eights, which is around
[00:40:01] lead generation, the hierarchy of attention, right? So do we actually have written out who deserves
[00:40:06] the best of my attention? And then do I ask questions around that? So, you know, the Lord, my wife,
[00:40:12] my kids, then my work, we often just say, oh, work has always got to jump up. No, it doesn't.
[00:40:17] Right? And so we're asking questions. Hey, did my wife get good, valuable attention from me this
[00:40:21] week? If not, how can I take the five to a six and just be paying attention to those things?
[00:40:26] Right? And then how do we intentionally go achieve that? So it's really my hope, right? Is
[00:40:31] equipping the agent to say, why did you get into this industry in the first place? I was teaching
[00:40:36] this DJ last point of this. I was teaching this about a year ago. And agent comes up to me and she
[00:40:41] introduced herself as a solo agent and a mom. She said, Garrett, last year, I sold 55 homes,
[00:40:46] best year ever. That's an amazing year. And she said, everyone's asking me, how many of them
[00:40:49] are going to sell this year? So I say 60 or 70 because we're supposed to grow, right? She said,
[00:40:53] Garrett, after hearing you talk, it was roughly what was in the book. After hearing you talk, I'm going
[00:40:58] to intentionally sell only 30 homes and it's going to change my life. And I said, well, you know,
[00:41:03] why? I didn't, I wasn't trying to tell you to sell fewer homes. And she said, no, no, no, Garrett,
[00:41:07] I got into this industry because I wanted to pick up my daughter from school every day.
[00:41:11] Right. Guess what I've been too busy to do because I'm selling homes. I'm going to change,
[00:41:16] I'm going to sell 30 homes only. It's going to change my life and it's going to change her life.
[00:41:21] And so I think we got a reset to why did I get into this in the first place? And am I
[00:41:26] intentionally building in that direction? And my hope is to redefine success for agents and then
[00:41:30] equip them to actually go do that and restore the relationships they've honestly traded too often
[00:41:35] to achieve quote unquote success because I really believe we can have a bigger, bigger, better life
[00:41:40] if we understand how to do it the right way. What I'm hearing is a lot of intentionality.
[00:41:45] It's really thinking about what's the, what if I could design, if I could literally sit in
[00:41:51] and design my ideal career by ideal life, my ideal balance with work life, which again,
[00:41:58] I don't I don't think there ever is a true balance. But the the the breakdown of how much time I
[00:42:02] spend, how much time I get to spend with my kids. If if I could map that all out and I could say
[00:42:07] this would make me the happiest and this would be best for my family. And could is that first of all,
[00:42:13] is it is achievable? Is it reasonable? Is it is it in line with reality? And then, okay,
[00:42:18] what what do I need to do to make that happen? I think most people don't do that, right? I think we
[00:42:24] think maybe in terms of business goals, like you said, GCI, number of deals, we're not necessarily
[00:42:28] thinking how many games or little of little league do I want to miss next year because I have
[00:42:34] stuff going on in the evening because I'm a REALTOR and that's how it goes. Like maybe I do have
[00:42:38] to miss a few, but maybe I only I'm going to miss five out of 40 or whatever it might be,
[00:42:43] or maybe I don't want to miss any. And that's important to me. But having to that figured out
[00:42:48] ahead of time, I'll tell you, this is something my I didn't think to do this on my own. I read this.
[00:42:53] So I started doing it with in my relationship with my fiancee where we would I realized, you know,
[00:42:59] we come from different backgrounds like everybody does. And we would have different experiences
[00:43:04] around things like vacations and holidays and, you know, just in anything that we do together,
[00:43:11] I have to think this is a different human being with a different set of beliefs, values, and goals,
[00:43:16] and maybe is going to want different needs around this. So we're going to my parents place for
[00:43:22] Thanksgiving. My parents are lovely people. And they're also not my fiancee's parents. So she will
[00:43:28] be less comfortable there than I would be because I can hang out with my parents all day. It's no
[00:43:32] big deal. And I want to make sure that her experience there is a good one. So I could just think
[00:43:38] from my perspective and go, it's going to be easy. My parents are nice. It's no big deal. And that
[00:43:43] might not be her experience. She might feel on edge like I've to impress these people, even though
[00:43:47] she's been with them a long time, she might feel more stress around it. So I need to ask her,
[00:43:51] hey, what do you want this weekend to look or this week Thanksgiving to look like? What would
[00:43:57] meet your needs? How can I show up for you? And how can I make sure that you're comfortable? Because
[00:44:02] for me, I'm going to be easily comfortable because that's where I grew up. But this idea of
[00:44:06] building that out and finding out what does that look like. And then thinking to myself, too,
[00:44:11] what do I want that week to look like? Because I should have a plan for myself as well. So we're
[00:44:18] really talking about just building things out and really thinking them through. And if we do this,
[00:44:25] and this is the season to do it when time when things are a little slower, I think, is to really
[00:44:29] think about next year, what do you want? What do you want your life to look like? And putting
[00:44:35] that together, and it's not easy. It's hard-grueling work to figure that out. But once you figure it out,
[00:44:41] then you can just kind of work backwards from it and say, okay, well, these are the number
[00:44:45] deals I want to do. These are the number hours I want to spend with my kids. How am I going to keep
[00:44:48] myself accountable so that I am seeing my kids every day? Am I going to be checking in with my
[00:44:53] partner? Am I going to be making sure that she's getting enough attention? Or how am I going to be
[00:44:58] held accountable for these things? And it seems like you're a big fan of all of this. Like this idea
[00:45:04] of, you know, you're tracking it all. And I do the same thing. We track in my relationship. We
[00:45:10] track things like how many date nights do we have? How many? Yeah, well, you have to because, oh,
[00:45:15] sorry, I'm not telling other people to do that, but I have. Because I will get caught up in my own
[00:45:21] life, and I will all of a sudden a week goes by, and I don't love my fiance any less, but I'm like,
[00:45:26] oh, I haven't planned anything. And it's not because I don't like her. I just didn't think to do it
[00:45:30] because I'm self self self-suffering. And you're busy. Yeah. Yeah. And it's like, no, that's not good
[00:45:36] for a relationship. So my, you know, I can just hope that, you know, I'll remember do things. Or I
[00:45:42] could put it in my calendar that by Wednesday of every week we have a plan for Saturday night. It's
[00:45:47] like not that hard. And it's and it makes her happy and it makes me happy. And it's a really smart
[00:45:52] play. So what we're telling everybody who's listening here is, yes, be intentional about your
[00:45:58] business, but also be intentional about what really brings you the most fulfillment in life. And
[00:46:03] make that in because it is going to help you when times are tough. And business comes and goes. And,
[00:46:09] you know, certainly the market comes, you know, changes. And it's not always easy. And it's not
[00:46:13] always fun. But you can build in fulfillment. And if you know that playing with your children and
[00:46:19] being there for your spouse or your partner, if that's fulfilling to you, you better build that in.
[00:46:24] So that, you know, you have that guaranteed no matter what. Yeah. That's right. So good. I mean,
[00:46:30] I think in, in first, let me say, I am in no way perfect at this, right? Not even close. I'm in
[00:46:35] pursuit of this too. Right. And so I think it's easy. Oh, well, you wrote a book about it. Well,
[00:46:39] I'm not great at this either. Right. I'm trying to figure it out. But I think it is, are we going
[00:46:44] to live on purpose or on accident? And I started to realize, I was just, I was waking up. I was just
[00:46:50] doing stuff that everybody told me to do and thought everything's fine. And if I played that out for
[00:46:54] a long time, yeah, I might have had more money potentially. But I would have had fewer relationships
[00:47:00] and deep relationships with the people I actually cared about. Right. Most of us get into it and say,
[00:47:04] you know, for me, I'm doing this for my family. I'm doing this for my family. Well, what gets pushed
[00:47:08] aside first? The family does. Well, I'm doing it for you. Well, what if we want you to be home?
[00:47:12] And so I think exactly what you said, DJ, you got to have those conversations, you know, one
[00:47:17] pivotal conversation for me a couple of years ago before I wrote this book, but a couple of years
[00:47:22] ago, I was just driven. Like we're going to do this. We're going to build that. It's going to be
[00:47:26] amazing. We're going to earn these all these things. And I finally stopped one day and just ask
[00:47:30] my wife Rachel. I was like, if it takes me longer to achieve this, but I'm home more often, is that
[00:47:36] what you want? That she's like, absolutely. Why did I never ask you that? Right. Like I just assume
[00:47:41] this is what you wanted. And I never asked you. And she said, it is what I want, but I wanted to
[00:47:46] take longer because I need you home. And like, I don't know why I didn't ask, right? We assume that
[00:47:51] this is what I want. So it's clearly what she wants. Right. Or it's what my kids want. Or what if I
[00:47:56] ask my kids, hey, do you feel like you get to see daddy often enough? Right? Now, yeah,
[00:48:01] I will provide for your family. I hit that. But what if they're like, no, we don't see daddy
[00:48:06] enough. And instead, I look at it this way, DJs, I have an ego account and I have a family
[00:48:11] account. I'm only going to put it into one. So each decision, right? It's, you know, hey, my
[00:48:16] family's taking care of it. I got to go sell this million dollar house. I'm not saying necessarily,
[00:48:20] you can't do that, right? But what if your kids sitting there like, dad, you've missed my game,
[00:48:24] every single game this year? What if you said to that client, hey, I can't come tonight? I got
[00:48:30] to put something in the family account, right? Or I have an appointment, you don't need to say a family
[00:48:34] account, but I have an appointment already. Whatever it is, I promise you, that's going to matter more
[00:48:39] than the client saying, oh, yeah, tomorrow's fine, right? Or you miss out on this, that opportunity.
[00:48:44] Well, what is your, I'm 38. What is my table going to look like when I'm 60? Are my kids back?
[00:48:50] Are they bringing their kids in their spouses? Or, and are they hoping and having a great relationship
[00:48:54] with daddy and saying, daddy, here's our kids. We're so excited to see you. They live near. They
[00:48:58] want to spend time with us just like you with your parents, right? Or is it like dad was always on
[00:49:02] the phone? He's on the phone again. He's doing the deals and like, you know, whatever will come,
[00:49:06] but we don't want to stay that long. What are you building? And what are you paying attention to?
[00:49:11] It's easy to fall into the trap up. Do more, do more, do more, hustle, hustle, hustle, 24, 7 availability.
[00:49:17] It's harder to say, that's not what I want. And I got to build a business based around the life I want.
[00:49:22] And then when I asked that question, right, how do I sell 30 homes and be at every soccer game and
[00:49:27] coaches, literally team, whatever their question was, then and only then, can I build the business
[00:49:33] the way I want to the way I need to that's going to serve my life to. And we just let it go.
[00:49:38] We're showing up on accident when we should be on purpose. And you know, we got to reclaim that.
[00:49:43] Yeah, it's it's all about knowing yourself, knowing what you need and then asking the people
[00:49:50] around you, how do I best show up for you? And how do we check in? Like you said, I love that asking
[00:49:56] your kids the hard question. Am I doing enough for you right now? Do you see enough of me?
[00:50:00] And that boy, you know, that's a question that is not an easy one to ask because there will be times
[00:50:06] when you ask that question, you get an answer that you do not want to hear. And that's the most
[00:50:11] important time. There's a whole reason you're asking it is to get the truth. But you have to,
[00:50:16] you have to take that punch to the face and go, okay, I need to make an adjustment because
[00:50:20] because I am not meeting my child's need. And look, I mean, it is not easy being a parent and
[00:50:27] also working and doing everything else that everyone's expected to do everything these days and be
[00:50:31] perfect. And of course, we're not. And boy, check in with the people in your life that you care
[00:50:37] about. Am I showing up enough for you? Am I giving you what you need? What can I do more to make,
[00:50:43] you know, your, you know, your existence a little bit better? I always say this with people who
[00:50:49] work at companies. I, my fiance is, she's an attorney and she's asking for a raise and she feels
[00:50:56] that she has a good case to, to make, to get a raise. And she has done a lot for the firm.
[00:51:03] And she's going to present her argument, which is what lawyers do. And she's got this all sort of
[00:51:08] mapped out. And she read it to me and she wanted to be very intentional about it to say,
[00:51:13] I'm not asking just to ask, I created this much revenue. And I think I should, you know,
[00:51:18] deserve a raise, you know, commensurate with that. And it all makes sense. It's all logical. And
[00:51:22] I said, that's all great. I said, I would add one thing in. And it's just didn't occur to her
[00:51:27] because she was thinking about, I just need to make sure my argument makes sense. I said, you need,
[00:51:32] ask the, the person who owns the business is, is her boss. I said, ask him what his biggest
[00:51:38] problems are. Where does he, what does he lie awake at night worried about? Because it's different
[00:51:43] from what you lie awake. Like you're an employee, you're, you're not worried about maybe the,
[00:51:47] paying the bills for, for the, doing, you know, meeting all the different demands of all the
[00:51:53] employees. Like maybe there's, you know, you don't know, you don't know what his, his fears are.
[00:51:58] Ask him what those fears are in your meeting. And then ask him, how can I help you
[00:52:03] with those fears? You know, and, and what can I do to help make that easier for you? And I'm like,
[00:52:09] that's what people really want is they want you to know, where am I struggling? And can you help me
[00:52:14] with that? And whether it's a client, whether it's, you know, your, your son or whether it's an
[00:52:20] employer, it's like we all just want somebody to go, I see you, I see you struggling in this way,
[00:52:26] because everybody struggles, and I can help you with that. And those are the people that we hold
[00:52:30] on to for life. Like those are the people that go, I know what you need. And I'm going to ask you
[00:52:36] what it is. And then I'm going to deliver that for you. Those are friends, those are family,
[00:52:40] those are people that, you know, you hold on to, you know, it's community. And I think we need
[00:52:45] to be really, really diligent about asking that question as much as possible. And it's not an easy
[00:52:51] question to ask. And oftentimes people don't know what they need. But you, if you're persistent,
[00:52:57] you know, it's what happens when somebody passes away, you know, everybody goes and they say
[00:53:01] something like, you know, I'm here if you need me. And that's a lovely sentiment. And it's better
[00:53:06] to say nothing for sure. But it's also kind of like the person's not going to say, well, I need you
[00:53:11] to do this. Like they're going to go, okay, great. And that's going to be the end of it. And I'm not
[00:53:14] saying that you need to do more than that. But if you wanted to do more than that, you might say,
[00:53:19] hey, I know you're struggling with this, this, you know, the thing that happened. And I,
[00:53:24] obviously, you know, I can't imagine what that's like, but what part of your life right now is
[00:53:29] really most disrupted. And it's like, oh, like making food is kind of a hassle because I'm dealing
[00:53:34] with all this grief. Like I can do that for you. Like I can take care of that. You know, and then
[00:53:37] all of a sudden, you have something to work towards. And so I think that's, you know, you're doing
[00:53:42] that with your kids. How are you seeing enough of daddy? You know, that kind of thing is so, so
[00:53:47] critical. And again, I applaud you as a parent for doing that. I don't, I don't think a lot of
[00:53:53] parents knew to do that. I don't think it was like they were like, screw the children. I'm not going
[00:53:58] to do it. You know, to do it. And boy, they would have, they would have had a lot of, they've
[00:54:04] had a lot of great feedback. And but then you have to be willing to do the work. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:54:09] Yeah, yeah. It's, I love what you said, two quick thoughts is, so when my mom was in the hospital
[00:54:14] on her last days, right, I remember one of my dad's good friends. He didn't, he's like you said,
[00:54:19] he didn't call up and say, hey, do you need anything? What do you need? How can I help? He showed up
[00:54:24] at the hospital with food. And he called my dad and said, hey, I'm here. I brought you food.
[00:54:30] If you'd like to come eat, I'm here, right? If not, I'll go away. And I just thought, man, like,
[00:54:35] he just showed up. That's a good man. Right. When my mom passed away, he had friends that would
[00:54:39] show up and call at his house and say, I'm here. I know you're learning them outside, right?
[00:54:45] If you want me to come in, I'll happily come in. If not, I'll go away. And I just thought,
[00:54:48] and I just want to be the guy that just shows up, right? To your point that like, I don't want to
[00:54:52] just ask the question just to make me feel better. I want to show up and say, I think you're probably
[00:54:56] alone. How can I help? And so I love that, right? Number one, number two is, you're right. Everything is
[00:55:02] hard, right? It's hard to build a business, hard to be a parent, it's hard to be married, it's hard
[00:55:05] to be all the things. But it's also really hard to grow up and then not have a relationship with
[00:55:11] your kids. That's hard too, right? And so like all of it's going to be hard. You just, we've heard
[00:55:15] before, we've got to choose the hard. And so am I going to do the work now, right? Or is it going
[00:55:20] to be way harder later? I think it was Ramsey that said, if you do what's hard now, life will be easy,
[00:55:25] if you do as easy, life will be hard. And so yeah, it's all hard. That's fine. Can we just acknowledge
[00:55:30] that building a business and all those things are hard? They are hard. Okay. Well, if that's just
[00:55:35] true, then why am I surprised and why am I frustrated by it? But I want to show up how I want to
[00:55:40] show up and I fail all the time. But when my six year old son, right? My oldest is eight. My
[00:55:44] youngest is four months. But when my six year old son says, Hey, Daddy, can you come play Legos
[00:55:48] with me? I need to not just say, Oh, sorry, Daddy's working. I need to actually sit. Sometimes
[00:55:53] that is true. But I need to say, Oh, actually, buddy, I do have 10 minutes before my next meeting.
[00:55:57] Of course, let's play Legos. You know, and so there's pieces of that where we have to be honest,
[00:56:02] we need to not pretend like we're the busiest person in the world if we aren't, right? And then
[00:56:06] actually show up where we can show up. Do the best that you can with what you have where you are.
[00:56:10] And that's what a good life is going to look like. Boy, you said it all. I couldn't agree with you
[00:56:15] more. The balancebreakthrough.com is the website to go to learn about the new book. Again,

And then you can have some cool stuff to post over the holiday season. Thank you to our sponsors for shooting that over to me. All right, let's get on to it. My conversation with Garrett Maroon. Best advice you've received in real estate. Best advice I've ever received in real estate is pick a path and stay there long enough until it works. Tell me more. I have been fortunate. I've sold 650 homes in the past 11 years, 100% by referral, never done an open house or cold call or made a door knock or any bottle lead ever. And not from here. I only had 40 people in my database and just was encouraged. Look, it'll work if you just keep going. And so I just kept going and I believed in their belief and paid off. Unreal. Amazing. Worst advice you've received in real estate. So many things, right? DJ, worst advice I've received was actually from a coach in that same vein as I had sold 50 houses my second year in the industry. I hired this coach and said, look, I don't want to sell more. I just want to go home. And at the end of the first call to you, she said, all right, here's your homework. She knew I'd never done any of these things. She said, here's your homework. You need to go cold call 300 people this week and door knock 150 doors. And that's your homework. And I said, I'm not going to do that. She said, Garrett, you're not going to succeed then. And I was thinking, I mean, I feel like I'm succeeding. I mean, the top 1% in this market. And so we get on the phone the next week, DJ, like, did you do your homework? No, I told you, I wasn't going to do my homework. It's like, Garrett, you're not going to succeed. You need to call 300 door knock 150. Anyways, that was the worst advice I've ever received, right? Is you need to look like everyone else to win. Totally untrue. That was the worst advice. And thank you for that, ignored it. But that was the worst advice I think I've ever been given. To thine own self be true, they say, right? That's right. That's right. I love it. Garrett Maroon is our guest today. Let me tell you more about Garrett. And this is going to be a really, really amazing conversation. Garrett's real estate story started really small, as he said. He had just 40 names in a database, which is basically nothing. And as a vision, he was fueled by the relationships over leads. He began fast forwarding 11 years. Now he's closed over 650 homes, as he said. In his second year, 50 closing on rail. But again, 100% by relationships. That's just unreal. He's the founder of two 10 Realty Group, which is a top 1% team in Southeast Virginia. And Garrett brings more than expertise. He leads with authenticity, heart, and a deep commitment to serving both clients and his team with excellence. But real estate really is just the beginning. Garrett co-founded the 210 Collective at eXp Realty, where faith and business meet in powerful ways. He also launched the Faithful Agent, which is a nonprofit and vibrant community for gospel-centered agents who want to grow not just their business, but their walk with Christ. And every week on the Faithful Agent podcast, Garrett shares talk and real strategy to help agents thrive at work without burning out at home. And in his book, The Balance Breakthrough, his message is very clear. You don't have to choose between success and your soul. You can win at work without losing at life. And so what's Garrett's superpower? He is helping agents make more money by staying true to who they are and also doing what they love at home. Garrett's world is full of laughter and life with his wife, Rachel. They have five amazing kids. He's deeply involved in his church, always ready with the dad joke, grounded in the belief that true success is built on relationships, faith, family, and business in that order. Garrett is our guest at GarrettMaroon.com, is where you find him. He has a new book coming out probably by the time you listen to this, called The Balance Breakthrough. And it is going to be a huge success like his last book. So check it out, you can go to GarrettMaroon.com and it's M-A-R-O-O-N, just like it sounds. We'll have a link to that, Garrett with two ours and two T's. We'll have a link in the show notes. But go there, pre-order the book, you get the audio download for free. And we're gonna talk all about the book today as well. Garrett, welcome to the show. Yeah, thanks, Steve Jobs. And they're thinking, my assistant wrote a really nice introduction for me. So thank you for reading that and thank you, Shalee for writing that. It's, I'm honored, man, I'm honored to be here. Authenticity is something that just, I can feel it on you and I can tell, and probably our audience already can feel that as well from you. And you are really somebody who is just willing to say, this is me, this is what I'm into, this is what I believe. And you can integrate some of those passions, which aren't necessarily real estate-related, but combining them, you're your faith and just other things that you do and doing nonprofits. Just, it's really impressive that you were able to build this brand, and I don't want to say brand, because that probably cheapens the idea of it, saying it that way, but it's really who you are. And I just think, what a cool, authentic business you must run. But I want to go all the way back to the beginning, because I want to hear how you started with 40 names and really not much hope, I would think, at that point. But you just, I mean, well, at least when you first started thinking like, how am I going to do this? What you did it, second year, 50 deals. So why real estate, how'd you get in? Yeah, so I got in because of my wife told me to do it. Right, I tried to listen to my wife. You're a good soldier, you do what you're talking about. That's right. And so, man, DJ, I was a assistant director of admission at the university here. And I was making 42 grand a year. My wife and I were married, didn't have kids at the time, but the goal was for her to come home when we had kids, thinking I can't do that on 42,000. So I was looking at other jobs, right? A standard W2, my parents are amazing, and that's what they taught me, right? You kind of work a job for 30 years, that's what we do. And my wife came along and said, I think you'd be really good at real estate. So, my parents tried to talk me out of it. A lot of friends tried to talk me out of it, but I just, honestly, I trusted my wife. You know, I think there's seasons where you got to borrow other people's belief, and that's what I did. So I borrowed her belief that I could do it. I love that. But we also agreed that if I didn't sell it home in three months, I'd quit, right? We had no concerts on. No concerts. Well, three months comes and goes, haven't sold a house. And I remember the conversation that night at dinner, and I'm telling her, I think, you know, I didn't know. I think I can figure this out. Can I have another three months and we agreed, thankfully. And so at five and a half months, finally made a sale. And honestly, the rest just, it really started to grow pretty rapidly. I had no idea that I was building underground, right, the root system was growing. I didn't know that because I didn't know what I didn't know. But then I started to see that effectiveness. So yeah, it was the belief of my wife, who said, I think you'd be good at it. It was the need to make more than $42,000 a year. And I just went for it. And I was literally what happened. I had no idea if I was gonna be good, didn't think that I was an entrepreneur until a year and a half in. You know, I still was like, I don't know what I'm doing. I'm just trying to survive and not fail. So yeah, it was a really interesting beginning. It definitely was, but I'm thankful for all the, you know, experience I had. And the fact that I'm still here and it continued to grow. Now they say necessity is the mother of invention, right? You just figure it out when you have to. And when you have someone to support and someone that you've committed to, and you know, you're part of the deal and you gotta pay in just like she's paying. And giving her the opportunity to, you know, to when you have kids to not have to go out there. And that is, that's it. Yeah, you people are, it's amazing what people can do. And you don't even have to know if you can. You just have to be almost in a situation where you have to do it. And it's like, you'll probably figure it out. And I'm 100%, yeah, I'm sorry, DJ. No, go ahead. Yeah, I was gonna say, I think that the way I described business now, right, is you walk into a pitch black room and they shut the door behind you. And there's one light switch, right? That's it. Just one light switch you gotta find. There's furniture and all kinds of stuff in that room. You're gonna bump into it. You're gonna get hurt. There's gonna be all those things. But if you stay in that room long enough, you'll find the switch. I mean, there is no other option. If you're just there long enough, you'll find it. And so that's, you know, these are things I didn't understand at the time. But because we said what about another three months, it gave me time to find the light switch. If I'd given up, never would have found it, would have assumed, as not the room for me, I'm gonna quit. And who knows what would have happened, right? The ripple effect of just the continuing to look for that switch changed my entire life, right? It's gonna change my kids' life. So that's my, you know, I'm so passionate about, especially newer agents, it's hard. It's going to be hard, still hard for me now. But the reality is if you just stay long enough, you'll find the switch. And so the only question is, are you gonna give up? And if you're unwilling to give up, you'll find it. And you'll figure it out and it'll change everything. I couldn't say it better myself. I agree a hundred and 20%. It is absolutely the truth. And really it's all about just putting the blinders on and not looking for the results right away. And in fact, probably not looking for the results at all. And just going, I, smarter people than me have done this or even dumber people than me have done this. And so it's like, I just have to follow the path that's pretty well been, you know, trodden before. And it's not like you're, you're forging a brand new thing that nobody's ever done and you're not sure. Oh no, millions of people have done it. So it's kind of like, just this, I just have to trust that it's all gonna work out and hard work pays off. And especially in this career, it really does. And it's one of the most fair industries I know. And, you know, because it really, there is a positive correlation between the amount of work you put in and the results you get. But you have to be willing to wait for those seeds to germinate, like you said, and you're not gonna see what's happening under the soil. And it's going to feel like failure for a long time. And it does. But that's how everything is, isn't it? Like every time I go to the gym and I do, well, today I had to do these really difficult pushups. And every time I do them, it's not like there's any part of me that's like, this is easy, this is great, this is fun. Like it all is awful and painful and it hurts. But it's like, it's kind of supposed to and that's the point of it. And it's like, that's the only way the muscles get stronger is you have to break them apart. You literally rip them apart. And in order to do that, you got to be willing to sort of go, I'm gonna like be standing in the pathway of pain. And that's kind of how it is for most things that are worthwhile. Maybe everything is worthwhile. So like you got to just put the energy and time into it and trust that like this is good for me. Yeah. We'll work out. And it almost, I found it in life, at least in this country. I mean, look, I can't speak for every, there's lots of places where things aren't very fair. And there's a lot of unfairness here too, but there's a lot of fairness. And if you put your mind to it, it almost doesn't matter what your background is in this business. Like you can make your way. People don't really care where you come from. They just care if you care about them and you're gonna do a good job and you're gonna meet their needs. Like that's pretty much it. Yeah, I love that. It's very fair, I think, this business. It's so true. I mean, that is such a good point, right? I can end of the day, anybody, I'll give you an example, right? So for a while, we had a coaching company. We were giving out the playbook, if you will, and like what to do every month to grow your business by relationships. I get a call, this a couple years ago, DJ, I get a call from this agent. And she's like, hey, I need to cancel. And it's not working for me. Hey, totally understanding. Can you tell me why? Because it's worked for a lot of agents, right? And she's like, well, it's, I wasn't getting the traction, whatever, whatever. And come to find out, she finally admits, as well, I actually didn't do it. And I'm like, all right, so you don't know it didn't work. You just didn't work it, right? How are you blaming what I'm doing? To your point, it's fair. If you do the work, you'll get the result. I don't know how fast it'll come. And I don't know how big the result will be, but I do know what's gonna happen. Because it always happens, that's the way this works. So you're right, it's very fair. Show me what you've done in the past three months. I'll show you what your business looks like. It's the, I love that. Never heard you might say it's the fairest industry. It really is though. You're 100% right about that. It's certainly one of them. And it's commensurate with the amount of work. Whereas, you know, other careers where you're a salary to employ, maybe it's fair, maybe it isn't. There's, you don't have a ton of control, maybe about that. But certainly, this is one where there seems to be, you know, a level, a somewhat of a level playing ground. Or at least as level as it maybe could be. And I think that's what's really neat is, you know, I go to the NAR conference I didn't this year, but you go and you see all different kinds of people. It's like nobody, people don't even look the same. You know, everyone looks different and you go, oh, that's so cool that everybody could just be themselves and they can figure out a pathway. And here they all are and they've all made it. And it's like, that is pretty cool. Yeah. Well, let's, let's talk a little bit about your faith because I think this is such an interesting thing. I rarely talk to agents who put that front and center in their business. And I think I was talking to you about this sort of before we started. And I think what I thought was really amazing. I was really thinking about this because I was going, okay, so I live in the city where people keep that sort of things like religion and politics. You almost have to at least here in Chicago. You have to be really careful about what you say because people are really judgy here. There's a lot of judgment. And if you think differently from then the norm is people get kind of weird about it. But, but that being said, and people are just judgy about religion and politics anyway. But the point is, is I was thinking, do I, like I'm thinking about if I was really, if I was super religious, I was thinking, okay, if I went to this thing, like for example, I play tennis. And so I think about the people I play tennis with, real kind of similar, like maybe we have different careers and we have different family lives and whatever. But we all kind of love tennis in the same way. And I was thinking, you know, the cool part about with putting religion that's really important to you into your business is it's such a way of life. A religion is a way of life for people. It's a guideline for how to live and how to see the world. And what I love about it is, you know, I would assume and you'll tell me if this is accurate, is that you're going to attract people who have a very similar worldview and a very similar outlook on life and kind of go through the same experiences. And I think that probably creates just a lot of intimacy and a lot of like instant connection. So if you're mind sharing about that, I'd love to hear. Of course, yeah, absolutely. First we got to get you into pickleball. That's the new thing, DJ. I was just telling you. As tennis players, we do not like pickleball, but I know that everybody loves pickleball. I'm not picking on you pickleball people. The thing, us brackets towards people, we're just glad you're doing it. So please keep doing that. Love it, love it. No, so now, and I appreciate the question. I mean, I think for anybody, right, I'm huge into authenticity. And so I'll just grab it this way and then certainly answer the question. But a couple of weeks ago, I was on a podcast and the gentleman beforehand said, hey, we know you're the Christian agent guy, like you have the faith, I don't know these things, but that's not this show. If you don't mind, just don't talk about it. And I said, well, yeah, and I said, and I said, look, this is your show. I respect that. But it's not a backpack that I take on and off. Like this is who I am. And so I can't not be that. If it doesn't work for your audience, I respect that. Like I'm happy not to do this episode, right? I'm not gonna offend him. And he was like, no, I was doing it and we had a great conversation. But for anyone, right, they don't have to agree with what I believe that's okay. But for anybody to say, you don't need, you're not sometimes an agent, you know, I'm not sometimes an agent, sometimes a dad, sometimes a husband, sometimes a follower of Jesus. Like I'm all of those things all the time. And so whenever I show up, I should show up as that. This is just who I am. And if anything, the easiest thing to do is show up and be me. It's supposed to, wait, who am I supposed to be in this moment? That's exhausting. And, you know, I can't do that perfectly. And so for anybody, right, I want them to be encouraged. Just like this is who I am. And yeah, are you gonna repel some people? You sure you will. Are you gonna attract some others? Of course you will. That's great. And the people that come have already made a decision. I know who this person is. And I wanna work with him. Fantastic, right? It's part of letting, you know, part of your job is to be super clear about this. Is who I serve in this. So I don't, what I have found DJ though, that's interesting is when we went all in on that brand, right? And we just, because that's, they already knew that so we were, right? We just made it more clear. When we went all on that brand, I have a ton of clients and past clients in my devs who don't are not Christians and they don't disagree, you know, agree with that. And they're totally fine with it, right? We have a lot of people who the world would say are hardcore anti-Christian. And they come because they wanna get support and they know we're gonna treat them fairly. And so, you know, we're all, we'll serve anybody. Anybody deserves to be cared for and loved well. And so what's been interesting is it both sets a standard of service that they expect, which is good because it owns us accountable, right? And it layers levels the playing field. Excuse me to say, this is who I am. This is how we're gonna treat you. If I say we're gonna pray about this deal, you're not weirded out by that because you, I mean, what else did you expect I was gonna do, right? And we're gonna really try to show up and love you well because there's something greater going on here than just you buying a house. And so it sets the tone for what's about to happen. And it's been really freeing too, right? Again, I was never shy about it to begin with, but now it's like this, just who we are, the whole thing is branded that way, right? Now I have the Faithful Agent podcast and nonprofit for Christians in real estate. It's pretty clear who I am, right? And who specifically I feel like I need to serve. Doesn't mean I don't wanna help somebody else, but I'm just being honest about who I am. And if that's not you, it's okay. So I do want people to realize and see that in our industry, right, you're told, don't talk about politics, don't talk about religion. I definitely don't think talking about politics is the greatest idea ever, right? But with your religion, if like this is who I am, I would say you should talk about it. Even if you disagree with me, that's okay. We should be able to have those conversations. I should be able to do a deal with someone who's like, I totally disagree with everything you stand for. That's fine. Let's do this deal together, right? I'd love to hear you out. You hear me out. That's okay. We can have a relationship. So I think if more agents were just honest about who they were, stop trying to be what the industry told them to be and started to be themselves, they'd burn out less. That's definitely true. Number one, and they just have a better business. Why? Because when you show up and you're authentic, you're gonna show up more naturally. You're gonna show up more often, and you're naturally gonna wanna do it better. And I think if we did that, we'd build a bigger, better business and a bigger, better life. I think that when you have the courage to be authentic, which by the way is not easy. We, I think that's important. Yeah. I wanna go back to something, and I wanna then come back to this thought. But as we were talking about showing up with you, it's faith is one of the pillars of kind of your life. And I was thinking, we don't ask people who are gay. We don't say, don't be gay while you're a real-said agent. Like don't make that your identity. It's like, no, no, we encourage, it's like, of course, it's inclusion. Everybody should be who they are. And it's funny, but we do that sort of with religion, don't we? We sort of say, like, you're gonna, and it's funny too. I think about this with politics a lot. I always try to remember that you really want about half the country thinking one way and the other half thinking the other way because it keeps us very honest. That's like you look both sides going, the other side's wrong. And that's good for democracy because it sort of keeps us on the straight and narrow. But I love this idea of, you're right. It's like, once you figure out, this is who I am, this is important to me. And I'm not going to, you know, you're not here to prophletize, you are here to just say, this is my identity. And I think you're right, it does sort of suggest a certain level of care and also some values. And, you know, some really positive things that people associate or some people associate. And you're right, maybe other people don't. And that's fine because there's lots of people that are going to want that. And again, it is, I think the courage to show up as you are while it takes courage, it really tremendous courage. It ends up really rewarding you, like you said, because people see that and they go, that's courageous. Whether they agree with it or not, they're like, that's impressive because people, a lot of us, we have the masks we put on and the things we hide and the things we go, well, this is really what I'm into, but I don't really want people to know about it. For whatever reason we're afraid of judgment or shame being shamed or whatever. And it's like, okay, fine, maybe there's some things you don't share with everyone. But this idea that you can just be yourself and run a business is really pretty impressive in this industry. And I've seen all sorts of different types of people who I've interviewed people on the show who are like new agey and into sort of the crystal thing and sort of more, more like not as traditional, sort of even kind of wackier things. And they don't tremendously successful. And then there's the ex-athletes who work with athletes and everyone's different. And I just think it is so cool that you are willing to do that. And I think it activates something in other people. It's kind of like, I've noticed this when I started volunteering like a long time ago. I just thought it was kind of the right thing to do and I got involved and started supporting this particular organization. And I thought, oh, I just felt like I should probably do that. And then when I would tell, I wouldn't really tell people but they would find out I did it. And they would go like, oh, I wish I would do that. And I go, but you can go do that. Like it's not that big of a deal. But what I would do is would activate in them this need that they're like, oh, I should be more doing that. And so I think with your brand in particular around this, I think it's like, oh, yeah, I should be more authentic. I think you're going to get a lot of people who just are impressed by that. And I think so again, my hat's off to you. Let's talk. I want to talk about the podcast. And then I want to talk about the book. So the podcast is the faithful agent podcast. Tell us what it is and who it's for. Yeah. So it's for Christians in real estate, right? So it was started at DJ five and a half years ago as serving not selling. So I was talking about building your business by relationships, right? Which is really my heart and all of the things. My the story is so my mom passed away in October 2022 from breast cancer. And those next three months, I mean, they were really hard for me transparently. And it just caused me to stop and ask the Lord, right? And just pray like, who do you want me to serve? And what I what I realized was no one was specifically talking to Christians in real estate, right? Like no one was doing it. And I went looking for it. That's how I found that. That's how I realized no one was doing it, right? It's like, I want to hear that because I need something different, right? I want the real estate. I definitely do. But I'm in the season of grieving. Like I need them to talk to my heart too. And it couldn't find it. And so me and a buddy, my best friend Tyler who was co-host of the podcast at the time, we said, all right, let's just go all in then. Like we don't know what's going to happen. Let's just go all in. If we're looking for it, I bet there's other people looking for it. And so in January of 23, we went all in and said, we're going to do the faithful agent podcast. We started doing conferences. We launched them on profit, right? We just kind of went for it. And you know, it was amazing, DJ, because I think the way I describe it is, I've raised a lot of flags in my life, right? For different businesses or other things. No one ever cared except me, right? In my wife, if I actually made money doing it. But when we raised this flag, it was amazing. This is again, the call to authenticity. When I raised this flag, it was amazing. How many people reached out? I was like, man, I was waiting for something like this. Oh gosh, I didn't know I could talk about my face so openly. Thank you for doing this. I'm like, I'm not doing anything other than to try to be myself. And there are so many other people, right, that are looking for a Christian real estate. There are so many other people that are looking for whatever real estate, right? That when we stay quiet, everyone else feels like they're alone. And so what we realized was, you know, I'll just be out loud, you know, whatever. If I take flag for it, I don't really care, right? Because I'm not, I'm just being myself, whatever. If you don't like me, I get it. Not everybody's going to like me. But what we didn't realize was how encouraging it was to so many, literally thousands of agents who are just, man, thank you, because this is what we need. This is what we are looking for. And no one was specifically talking to us, right? Because there's a lot of us who get, I get what it's like being a real estate agent. So do you, right? But there's not a lot of people who get what it's like being a Christian real estate agent, right? You understand your business and your heart. And in any scenario, again, whatever is authentic to you, there's not a lot of people who understand, you know, real estate and struggling, uh, uh, whatever with addiction, right? Whatever it is, like, whatever is going on with you, there's other people that wish they could just hear the truth and the authentic message that you have to have and say, this is how you build a business while you're struggling with whatever. Or while this is your acting, it doesn't matter. We need to go first. Someone's got to be brave enough to go first. And I promise if you do, there are so many people that will say, I'm so glad you did that. I've been waiting for someone to do X, Y, and Z. So it's been an incredible journey so far. It's amazing. You just gave me an idea, well, not me an idea, but this idea that the recovering agent podcast, somebody who was recovered from addiction or at least is in recovery. Boy, that would be, I mean, that affects like 10% of the population. Like that is so many people and nobody's talking to that person. For real. You know, that's boy, that's another. Somebody needs to start that podcast. Here's what they do. Because of the end of the day, we need community. Like forever, whatever our tribe is, we need community. It's, we're biologically hardwired for community. And we need interpersonal effectiveness or interpersonal interactions. And with our phones, they take us largely away from that. And so, and that's, I'm not here to say phones are bad, but that's just kind of what the phones are designed to do. And so, okay, so we need places where people can go and congregate, be in community and be like, these are my people. And it's really, really good for us. And that's, that's, that's a great call to arms, pardon, pardon the sort of military expression. But this is really a great call to action for people who are thinking like, I'm into this thing. And I know other people are into it. And maybe I could create this community. And we can all support each other. You know, that is one of them. Yeah. And the moms in real estate do a phone nominal job, right, DJ? And they have, they have got that, they figured that out a long time ago. Yeah. And then things out in Florida. Right. And I love that. But it's like, put there's others. You know, I'm coaching right now an agent who's growing out the widowed agent community. Oh, right. He was widowed. And it's like, but you know, I, as much as I love agents and I love this agent, right, I don't get it, right? Like, I don't fully get it. I don't know what's going on. I've never experienced that. And so to your point, like we need to have those joint experiences where someone can say like, you really get how hard it is, right? Or I've coached a single mom before, right? Her husband left and she has four kids trying to build a business. Like, yes, I can teach you business principles. Yes, I care about what's going on with you. I'm going to try my best to do that. But what I really want you to do is go get coached by a single woman who is crushing it, who really gets it, right? There's just so much more to us than just being agents that we need, you know, and someone's got to go first. And I get that we're afraid of those things. Like I totally understand, you know, I've helped agents DJ build. I was teaching at this, this pretty large brokerage one day. And I started talking about building affinity groups, right? To grow your business. And one of the biggest agents there is like, well, you know, I'm just a mom and I don't really do a lot of stuff. Just a mom. Yeah. And I was like, well, first of all, I don't, I don't believe you, right? And so I said, what do the things you love? And she's like, I don't want to tell you. And I was like, tell me, she said, I love crime podcasts and I love wine. And I said, okay, hold on. How many women in here? Yes, millions and millions of people do that. And I'm like, why would you not just say, I'm going to start a group for any local mom who loves crime podcasts and wine, you know, once a month, whatever, come hang out, we'll just have fun together. She did it. Guess what? Not only did she love it, her business group because of it, because they want to work with people that are like them, right? And so when you're honest about who you are, they're like, why would they ever come to me if they're like, I love this lady, right? We go to her house, we listen to crap, that's because we have wine together, that's fun. That's, they get me. They're like me. Everybody needs that to your point. And so I think if we just stop being so afraid of like, let me just be honest about some of the things about me, our business would grow, our enjoyment would grow, right? And then we'd be able to show up better for everybody else in our life because we're like, I actually like some, it's still hard, but I actually like part of my day, right? As opposed to grinding it out all the time. So I just, there's a huge cause, just be authentic. It's okay. It's good. There's other people just like you. And it's a good thing, right? Someone needs to go first. And so if you're brave enough to go first, it's going to change your life too. And there's, and you know, I just highly, highly encourage that. And it opens up the, it opens up the ability for someone else maybe to say, I can step into my authenticity because that person did it. And it's really, it's what they say about intimacy. It's that somebody has to be vulnerable and tell their hard truth to another person. And what it does is it opens up the space for the other person to go, oh, it gives a permission to be like, oh, no, I can tell you about all my hard things. Yes, right. It's really scary and it's hard because that person could hurt you with that information and they could run away or they could, you know, that's, that's the reality of, of relationships. But most people don't do that. They actually find it so endearing because they go, oh, I need somebody to talk to about things too. So you're talking about the same thing. And I think it's just what a great, what a great reminder for all of us listening is, is don't hide who you are and you will find your tribe. Let's talk about the new book. So the breakthrough broke, the breakthrough broker. Oh, sorry, the balance breakthrough. Sorry, yeah, yeah. I belong to a, I support a men's organization and we have what's called breakthrough weekends. And so I've got breakthrough in my mind and it's a totally different thing because for 20 years, I can just talk about breakthrough weekends. Yeah, yeah. My apologies. The balance breakthrough is the book and it's coming out next week, although by the time you hear that it'll be this week. So it's available everywhere. Books are sold and online and we'll have a link to the Amazon, you know, in the show notes. But tell us about the book and what it's for. Yeah, so thanks, DJ. So I wrote this book. It's two years in the making, right? And really first and foremost, I wrote it hoping to restore the entrepreneurs family, right? Like I think of the kids of agents everywhere who are missing out on mommy and daddy time because the business is running them ragged. And so when I was coaching, that was my heart, right? For me, that was my heart. And so I'll just go quick breakdown, right? So part one of the book is all about redefining success on our own terms. So, you know, I found for me, I was building a business. I had a big team. I was doing all the things we had three kids. And then I realized like I had created this business that was crushing it. But it was taking me like 50, 60 hours a week. And so would I actually be most proud of the guy who figured out how to work less and make the same amount of money and spend more time with my kids? Or the guy who would double his business but work more and make more money but see his kids less? Like that was a really obvious answer. And then I started to wonder, well, why was I even doing what I was doing? And I came up, so my whiteboards literally to my left, I came up stairs DJ and I realized the only thing written on my whiteboard that I was measuring, number of deals, GCI and volume, right? That was it. And so it's like, okay, no wonder I'm adding agents, no wonder I'm doing this, no wonder I'm doing that. Because the only way I think I'm I can measure success is what the industry told me was success. How many deals did you do, right? How much money did you make? So it's a call to us to reset and redefine what success actually looks like to me. And so now my scoreboard is, yeah, a profit goal, but a wife goal and a kid goal. So like, a kid goal is every seventh week off, right? And now I have a new way to keep score. It's as simple as someone recently asked me, you know, how do you sell 30 homes a year? What would you tell that agent? And I said honestly, I tell them that's a bad question because it's easy. Go work 120 hours a week and spend 100K. You'll figure it out, right? Like, I think what you mean is, right? Which is where as agents we need to get to. I think what you mean is, you know, how do I sell 30 homes this year? Never miss a family dinner, right? And all and be able to coach my son, Socrates team. Whatever that scenario is, you've got to ask a better question, which really comes from, what am I actually trying to achieve? So that's really part one, right? It just stems from, so again, when I lost my mom, you recognize you look and you say there's a date, a dash, in a date. And the dash was her entire life. And her headstone doesn't say, French teachers, she wasn't a real estate agent, right? But it wouldn't say sold 100 ounces, right? 5 million GC at whatever. It wouldn't say those things. It would talk about her character, who she loved, who she spent time with. So if that's true, is that what we're building? Or are we just trying to make the industry happy? So that's part one. Part two is then trying to equip the agent to do that. So teaching what I call the PDA formula, right? Just because I wanted people to think of like, you're holding hands, that's gross, right? The public display of affection. But it's how do you build a predictable dollar productive or profitable business that guess what aligns with who you are? And so there's so much in there of, you know, I want you to be, so my wife's best family friends, the Jensen's, you'll appreciate this DJ. The dad is six foot 10. I'm five six and three quarters. And when you're five six, the three quarters matters, right? And so I remember visiting Mr. Jensen and he was like, yeah, I want you to show, I want to show you my sports memorabilia in my office. And like, when I went in super cool, what I remember though is Mr. Jensen works at a standing desk. I could walk back and forth under it without ducking, right? Like how is how are we the same human? That doesn't make sense. And so if I spent, and this is where I fear most agents are, if I spent my time saying, why am I not tall like him? If I was tall like him, I could have played basketball, I could have done this good and that whatever. We spend so much time there as opposed to, I bet I would crush him and hide and seek. There's no way he's going to hide at six dead, right? Right? If I paid attention to what I am uniquely gifted in and then went and tried to be excellent at that, so much is going to be better. So the PDA formula really centers around what is an alignment. And then how do you turn that into a predictable, profitable business? And then finally, it's really about part three is the intentional achievement. So I teach what I call the rule of eights, which is around lead generation, the hierarchy of attention, right? So do we actually have written out who deserves the best of my attention? And then do I ask questions around that? So, you know, the Lord, my wife, my kids, then my work, we often just say, oh, work has always got to jump up. No, it doesn't. Right? And so we're asking questions. Hey, did my wife get good, valuable attention from me this week? If not, how can I take the five to a six and just be paying attention to those things? Right? And then how do we intentionally go achieve that? So it's really my hope, right? Is equipping the agent to say, why did you get into this industry in the first place? I was teaching this DJ last point of this. I was teaching this about a year ago. And agent comes up to me and she introduced herself as a solo agent and a mom. She said, Garrett, last year, I sold 55 homes, best year ever. That's an amazing year. And she said, everyone's asking me, how many of them are going to sell this year? So I say 60 or 70 because we're supposed to grow, right? She said, Garrett, after hearing you talk, it was roughly what was in the book. After hearing you talk, I'm going to intentionally sell only 30 homes and it's going to change my life. And I said, well, you know, why? I didn't, I wasn't trying to tell you to sell fewer homes. And she said, no, no, no, Garrett, I got into this industry because I wanted to pick up my daughter from school every day. Right. Guess what I've been too busy to do because I'm selling homes. I'm going to change, I'm going to sell 30 homes only. It's going to change my life and it's going to change her life. And so I think we got a reset to why did I get into this in the first place? And am I intentionally building in that direction? And my hope is to redefine success for agents and then equip them to actually go do that and restore the relationships they've honestly traded too often to achieve quote unquote success because I really believe we can have a bigger, bigger, better life if we understand how to do it the right way. What I'm hearing is a lot of intentionality. It's really thinking about what's the, what if I could design, if I could literally sit in and design my ideal career by ideal life, my ideal balance with work life, which again, I don't I don't think there ever is a true balance. But the the the breakdown of how much time I spend, how much time I get to spend with my kids. If if I could map that all out and I could say this would make me the happiest and this would be best for my family. And could is that first of all, is it is achievable? Is it reasonable? Is it is it in line with reality? And then, okay, what what do I need to do to make that happen? I think most people don't do that, right? I think we think maybe in terms of business goals, like you said, GCI, number of deals, we're not necessarily thinking how many games or little of little league do I want to miss next year because I have stuff going on in the evening because I'm a REALTOR and that's how it goes. Like maybe I do have to miss a few, but maybe I only I'm going to miss five out of 40 or whatever it might be, or maybe I don't want to miss any. And that's important to me. But having to that figured out ahead of time, I'll tell you, this is something my I didn't think to do this on my own. I read this. So I started doing it with in my relationship with my fiancee where we would I realized, you know, we come from different backgrounds like everybody does. And we would have different experiences around things like vacations and holidays and, you know, just in anything that we do together, I have to think this is a different human being with a different set of beliefs, values, and goals, and maybe is going to want different needs around this. So we're going to my parents place for Thanksgiving. My parents are lovely people. And they're also not my fiancee's parents. So she will be less comfortable there than I would be because I can hang out with my parents all day. It's no big deal. And I want to make sure that her experience there is a good one. So I could just think from my perspective and go, it's going to be easy. My parents are nice. It's no big deal. And that might not be her experience. She might feel on edge like I've to impress these people, even though she's been with them a long time, she might feel more stress around it. So I need to ask her, hey, what do you want this weekend to look or this week Thanksgiving to look like? What would meet your needs? How can I show up for you? And how can I make sure that you're comfortable? Because for me, I'm going to be easily comfortable because that's where I grew up. But this idea of building that out and finding out what does that look like. And then thinking to myself, too, what do I want that week to look like? Because I should have a plan for myself as well. So we're really talking about just building things out and really thinking them through. And if we do this, and this is the season to do it when time when things are a little slower, I think, is to really think about next year, what do you want? What do you want your life to look like? And putting that together, and it's not easy. It's hard-grueling work to figure that out. But once you figure it out, then you can just kind of work backwards from it and say, okay, well, these are the number deals I want to do. These are the number hours I want to spend with my kids. How am I going to keep myself accountable so that I am seeing my kids every day? Am I going to be checking in with my partner? Am I going to be making sure that she's getting enough attention? Or how am I going to be held accountable for these things? And it seems like you're a big fan of all of this. Like this idea of, you know, you're tracking it all. And I do the same thing. We track in my relationship. We track things like how many date nights do we have? How many? Yeah, well, you have to because, oh, sorry, I'm not telling other people to do that, but I have. Because I will get caught up in my own life, and I will all of a sudden a week goes by, and I don't love my fiance any less, but I'm like, oh, I haven't planned anything. And it's not because I don't like her. I just didn't think to do it because I'm self self self-suffering. And you're busy. Yeah. Yeah. And it's like, no, that's not good for a relationship. So my, you know, I can just hope that, you know, I'll remember do things. Or I could put it in my calendar that by Wednesday of every week we have a plan for Saturday night. It's like not that hard. And it's and it makes her happy and it makes me happy. And it's a really smart play. So what we're telling everybody who's listening here is, yes, be intentional about your business, but also be intentional about what really brings you the most fulfillment in life. And make that in because it is going to help you when times are tough. And business comes and goes. And, you know, certainly the market comes, you know, changes. And it's not always easy. And it's not always fun. But you can build in fulfillment. And if you know that playing with your children and being there for your spouse or your partner, if that's fulfilling to you, you better build that in. So that, you know, you have that guaranteed no matter what. Yeah. That's right. So good. I mean, I think in, in first, let me say, I am in no way perfect at this, right? Not even close. I'm in pursuit of this too. Right. And so I think it's easy. Oh, well, you wrote a book about it. Well, I'm not great at this either. Right. I'm trying to figure it out. But I think it is, are we going to live on purpose or on accident? And I started to realize, I was just, I was waking up. I was just doing stuff that everybody told me to do and thought everything's fine. And if I played that out for a long time, yeah, I might have had more money potentially. But I would have had fewer relationships and deep relationships with the people I actually cared about. Right. Most of us get into it and say, you know, for me, I'm doing this for my family. I'm doing this for my family. Well, what gets pushed aside first? The family does. Well, I'm doing it for you. Well, what if we want you to be home? And so I think exactly what you said, DJ, you got to have those conversations, you know, one pivotal conversation for me a couple of years ago before I wrote this book, but a couple of years ago, I was just driven. Like we're going to do this. We're going to build that. It's going to be amazing. We're going to earn these all these things. And I finally stopped one day and just ask my wife Rachel. I was like, if it takes me longer to achieve this, but I'm home more often, is that what you want? That she's like, absolutely. Why did I never ask you that? Right. Like I just assume this is what you wanted. And I never asked you. And she said, it is what I want, but I wanted to take longer because I need you home. And like, I don't know why I didn't ask, right? We assume that this is what I want. So it's clearly what she wants. Right. Or it's what my kids want. Or what if I ask my kids, hey, do you feel like you get to see daddy often enough? Right? Now, yeah, I will provide for your family. I hit that. But what if they're like, no, we don't see daddy enough. And instead, I look at it this way, DJs, I have an ego account and I have a family account. I'm only going to put it into one. So each decision, right? It's, you know, hey, my family's taking care of it. I got to go sell this million dollar house. I'm not saying necessarily, you can't do that, right? But what if your kids sitting there like, dad, you've missed my game, every single game this year? What if you said to that client, hey, I can't come tonight? I got to put something in the family account, right? Or I have an appointment, you don't need to say a family account, but I have an appointment already. Whatever it is, I promise you, that's going to matter more than the client saying, oh, yeah, tomorrow's fine, right? Or you miss out on this, that opportunity. Well, what is your, I'm 38. What is my table going to look like when I'm 60? Are my kids back? Are they bringing their kids in their spouses? Or, and are they hoping and having a great relationship with daddy and saying, daddy, here's our kids. We're so excited to see you. They live near. They want to spend time with us just like you with your parents, right? Or is it like dad was always on the phone? He's on the phone again. He's doing the deals and like, you know, whatever will come, but we don't want to stay that long. What are you building? And what are you paying attention to? It's easy to fall into the trap up. Do more, do more, do more, hustle, hustle, hustle, 24, 7 availability. It's harder to say, that's not what I want. And I got to build a business based around the life I want. And then when I asked that question, right, how do I sell 30 homes and be at every soccer game and coaches, literally team, whatever their question was, then and only then, can I build the business the way I want to the way I need to that's going to serve my life to. And we just let it go. We're showing up on accident when we should be on purpose. And you know, we got to reclaim that. Yeah, it's it's all about knowing yourself, knowing what you need and then asking the people around you, how do I best show up for you? And how do we check in? Like you said, I love that asking your kids the hard question. Am I doing enough for you right now? Do you see enough of me? And that boy, you know, that's a question that is not an easy one to ask because there will be times when you ask that question, you get an answer that you do not want to hear. And that's the most important time. There's a whole reason you're asking it is to get the truth. But you have to, you have to take that punch to the face and go, okay, I need to make an adjustment because because I am not meeting my child's need. And look, I mean, it is not easy being a parent and also working and doing everything else that everyone's expected to do everything these days and be perfect. And of course, we're not. And boy, check in with the people in your life that you care about. Am I showing up enough for you? Am I giving you what you need? What can I do more to make, you know, your, you know, your existence a little bit better? I always say this with people who work at companies. I, my fiance is, she's an attorney and she's asking for a raise and she feels that she has a good case to, to make, to get a raise. And she has done a lot for the firm. And she's going to present her argument, which is what lawyers do. And she's got this all sort of mapped out. And she read it to me and she wanted to be very intentional about it to say, I'm not asking just to ask, I created this much revenue. And I think I should, you know, deserve a raise, you know, commensurate with that. And it all makes sense. It's all logical. And I said, that's all great. I said, I would add one thing in. And it's just didn't occur to her because she was thinking about, I just need to make sure my argument makes sense. I said, you need, ask the, the person who owns the business is, is her boss. I said, ask him what his biggest problems are. Where does he, what does he lie awake at night worried about? Because it's different from what you lie awake. Like you're an employee, you're, you're not worried about maybe the, paying the bills for, for the, doing, you know, meeting all the different demands of all the employees. Like maybe there's, you know, you don't know, you don't know what his, his fears are. Ask him what those fears are in your meeting. And then ask him, how can I help you with those fears? You know, and, and what can I do to help make that easier for you? And I'm like, that's what people really want is they want you to know, where am I struggling? And can you help me with that? And whether it's a client, whether it's, you know, your, your son or whether it's an employer, it's like we all just want somebody to go, I see you, I see you struggling in this way, because everybody struggles, and I can help you with that. And those are the people that we hold on to for life. Like those are the people that go, I know what you need. And I'm going to ask you what it is. And then I'm going to deliver that for you. Those are friends, those are family, those are people that, you know, you hold on to, you know, it's community. And I think we need to be really, really diligent about asking that question as much as possible. And it's not an easy question to ask. And oftentimes people don't know what they need. But you, if you're persistent, you know, it's what happens when somebody passes away, you know, everybody goes and they say something like, you know, I'm here if you need me. And that's a lovely sentiment. And it's better to say nothing for sure. But it's also kind of like the person's not going to say, well, I need you to do this. Like they're going to go, okay, great. And that's going to be the end of it. And I'm not saying that you need to do more than that. But if you wanted to do more than that, you might say, hey, I know you're struggling with this, this, you know, the thing that happened. And I, obviously, you know, I can't imagine what that's like, but what part of your life right now is really most disrupted. And it's like, oh, like making food is kind of a hassle because I'm dealing with all this grief. Like I can do that for you. Like I can take care of that. You know, and then all of a sudden, you have something to work towards. And so I think that's, you know, you're doing that with your kids. How are you seeing enough of daddy? You know, that kind of thing is so, so critical. And again, I applaud you as a parent for doing that. I don't, I don't think a lot of parents knew to do that. I don't think it was like they were like, screw the children. I'm not going to do it. You know, to do it. And boy, they would have, they would have had a lot of, they've had a lot of great feedback. And but then you have to be willing to do the work. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah. It's, I love what you said, two quick thoughts is, so when my mom was in the hospital on her last days, right, I remember one of my dad's good friends. He didn't, he's like you said, he didn't call up and say, hey, do you need anything? What do you need? How can I help? He showed up at the hospital with food. And he called my dad and said, hey, I'm here. I brought you food. If you'd like to come eat, I'm here, right? If not, I'll go away. And I just thought, man, like, he just showed up. That's a good man. Right. When my mom passed away, he had friends that would show up and call at his house and say, I'm here. I know you're learning them outside, right? If you want me to come in, I'll happily come in. If not, I'll go away. And I just thought, and I just want to be the guy that just shows up, right? To your point that like, I don't want to just ask the question just to make me feel better. I want to show up and say, I think you're probably alone. How can I help? And so I love that, right? Number one, number two is, you're right. Everything is hard, right? It's hard to build a business, hard to be a parent, it's hard to be married, it's hard to be all the things. But it's also really hard to grow up and then not have a relationship with your kids. That's hard too, right? And so like all of it's going to be hard. You just, we've heard before, we've got to choose the hard. And so am I going to do the work now, right? Or is it going to be way harder later? I think it was Ramsey that said, if you do what's hard now, life will be easy, if you do as easy, life will be hard. And so yeah, it's all hard. That's fine. Can we just acknowledge that building a business and all those things are hard? They are hard. Okay. Well, if that's just true, then why am I surprised and why am I frustrated by it? But I want to show up how I want to show up and I fail all the time. But when my six year old son, right? My oldest is eight. My youngest is four months. But when my six year old son says, Hey, Daddy, can you come play Legos with me? I need to not just say, Oh, sorry, Daddy's working. I need to actually sit. Sometimes that is true. But I need to say, Oh, actually, buddy, I do have 10 minutes before my next meeting. Of course, let's play Legos. You know, and so there's pieces of that where we have to be honest, we need to not pretend like we're the busiest person in the world if we aren't, right? And then actually show up where we can show up. Do the best that you can with what you have where you are. And that's what a good life is going to look like. Boy, you said it all. I couldn't agree with you more. The balancebreakthrough.com is the website to go to learn about the new book. Again, the balance breakthrough is the book. You can pre-order it.
