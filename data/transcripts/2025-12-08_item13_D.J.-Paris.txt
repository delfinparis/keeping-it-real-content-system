[00:01:16] Today's episode is brought to you by corded.io.
[00:01:20] Are you looking for agents to join your brokerage or team?
[00:01:23] Now as a real estate recruiter, I can tell you the answer is always yes.
[00:01:28] But most agents aren't looking to move right now.
[00:01:31] So how do you know who to contact?
[00:01:33] Well, what if I were to tell you there's a recruiting and retention tool powered by
[00:01:36] artificial intelligence that shows you exactly which agents in your local market are looking
[00:01:42] to leave their brokerage right now and which agents at your own firm are also looking
[00:01:47] to leave you.
[00:01:49] Now I've been recruiting REALTORS for 15 years and I've hired over 2000 agents.
[00:01:53] I can tell you with no exaggeration, this is the tool I've been waiting for.
[00:01:58] Corded's AI looks for trends across dozens of variables for each agent in your market
[00:02:03] and shows you which agents they believe are likely to move.
[00:02:06] Not only does it do that, but corded's AI went and visited my recruiting website and
[00:02:11] read everything I offer.
[00:02:12] So now when I'm recruiting, corded's AI tells me exactly what to say based on that
[00:02:18] agent's needs and what my brokerage can offer.
[00:02:21] It even writes emails for me.
[00:02:23] I've never seen anything like it and I use it every single day.
[00:02:27] Now if you are looking to grow your brokerage, corded.io is the best tool out there.
[00:02:32] Visit corded.io to schedule a demo again.
[00:02:35] That's corded.io.
[00:02:37] And now onto the show.
[00:02:53] Welcome to Keeping In Real, the largest podcast made by Real Estate agents and for Real Estate
[00:02:58] agents.
[00:02:58] My name is DJ Paris.
[00:03:00] I'm your guide and host through the show.
[00:03:02] And today is a very short and special episode that I want to have a tool that I just finished
[00:03:07] creating that I'd love for you to test out.
[00:03:11] So I was thinking, well, I'll tell you the story.
[00:03:13] So I just sold my condo and I really wanted to utilize AI to write the very best possible
[00:03:21] listing description because I knew that aside from having wonderful photos, the listing
[00:03:26] description is pretty important, right?
[00:03:27] So I thought, okay, I'm a pretty good writer.
[00:03:30] I've written for publications before.
[00:03:31] I consider myself a writer at heart.
[00:03:34] And so I put together what I thought was a decent first pass.
[00:03:37] And then I thought, no, it's not really good enough.
[00:03:39] And also I'm not a practicing agent.
[00:03:41] So even though I was doing this deal myself as an agent, I really didn't know the best
[00:03:47] way to sort of communicate this.
[00:03:48] So I thought I better get some help.
[00:03:50] So I went on to chat GPT and I thought, okay, who would be the best possible sort of
[00:03:56] team of writers that would put together this listing description, capping it out at
[00:04:00] a thousand characters, which is what our MLS has a maximum limit at.
[00:04:04] And so I started thinking about different avatars, different types of people that would
[00:04:08] have a different spin on this listing description.
[00:04:11] And what if they all work together in a team and sort of edited it together?
[00:04:15] So I came up with Persona as a best selling novelist, a top journalist for a newspaper
[00:04:21] who wins awards for their investigative journalism.
[00:04:24] I also have it like a master editor, somebody that edits people like top journalists
[00:04:29] in novelists.
[00:04:29] I also have a copywriter, an advertising person who knows how to get people to take action
[00:04:35] based on listing, right?
[00:04:36] And I put a few other avatars in there and I put it through a seven step process.
[00:04:40] So it literally takes an existing listing description and it runs it through seven different
[00:04:45] edits and then it gives you a final copy.
[00:04:47] And it does this all with AI behind the scenes and I'd really love for you to test this
[00:04:52] out.
[00:04:52] So please use it.
[00:04:54] It's totally free.
[00:04:55] Originally I was going to start charging for it.
[00:04:56] I don't think I'm going to do that.
[00:04:58] I think it's just it's really no big deal to give away.
[00:05:00] And I'd love you to try it.
[00:05:02] So you can go to test it at listing.joincale.gen.
[00:05:08] That's our brokerage.com.
[00:05:11] So listing.joincale.com.
[00:05:13] All you need to do, take a final listing description that for a listing you have or maybe
[00:05:18] one that you listed in the past and pull up the listing description, drop it in there.
[00:05:22] You'll have to answer a few questions about the property.
[00:05:24] The other thing that it does in addition to just rewriting the listing description, it
[00:05:29] also searches the area to look for things that maybe you missed in your listing description.
[00:05:34] Like, attractions that are nearby or amenities, it actually even looks at the house or the
[00:05:40] property itself to see, did you miss something inside the house, but certainly around the house
[00:05:45] in the neighborhood in the community.
[00:05:47] Where are things that are attractive to buyers that you might not have thought to put in
[00:05:50] there.
[00:05:51] And it maxes it out of the thousand characters.
[00:05:53] So there's a little bit limited there, but I really, I've tested this out with about
[00:05:57] 20 different REALTORS.
[00:05:59] They've all said it's improved their listing description.
[00:06:01] It takes about a minute or two to run the query and it will email it to you.
[00:06:05] So you don't even have to really wait online.
[00:06:07] But please try it.
[00:06:08] I would love for it to get your feedback on it.
[00:06:11] And it's just a fun tool that I built utilizing AI.
[00:06:14] And I'm going to continue to build additional tools that I think would be really fun.
[00:06:17] My next idea, just to give you a quick sort of insight into what where I'm going next is
[00:06:24] why is my listing not selling?
[00:06:26] And that one's really going to be fun because we're going to take all these different variables
[00:06:29] and have basically you would put in an address and it would just scan all these different
[00:06:35] reasons why the property isn't selling.
[00:06:37] Maybe it's obviously price is always the biggest one, but we're going to look at all these
[00:06:41] other, these justifications for why the price isn't where it should be.
[00:06:45] And it's going to return all that to you.
[00:06:47] And then the idea is you could use that with your client when he's like, why is my
[00:06:50] play not selling?
[00:06:51] You say, well, here's all the data we have on why it's not selling.
[00:06:54] And as an agent, I think that would just help you keep the account.
[00:06:57] So that's my next tool I'm working on.
[00:06:59] That'll probably take a few months.
[00:07:00] That one's trickier.
[00:07:01] But this one is really, really cool.
[00:07:03] I don't even have a name for it.
[00:07:05] But go to visit it at listing.joincail.com.
[00:07:08] And by the way, give me honest feedback.
[00:07:11] If it does not improve your listing description, I need to know that.
[00:07:14] Or if you're like, oh, it should do this and it doesn't do it.
[00:07:17] Or if you have a feature suggestion, I'm always adding on to it.
[00:07:20] By the way, you'll see in there that I think it says you only get five free credits, which
[00:07:24] means five free listings.
[00:07:26] I don't think there's actually a cap on it right now.
[00:07:28] So if you run into a limit issue there, just let me know.
[00:07:31] I can probably get that fixed.
[00:07:33] But I believe I turn that off.
[00:07:34] And it's totally free right now for everyone to use.
[00:07:37] And I just really want to get some feedback.
[00:07:39] And hopefully this will help you with your clients, rewriting listing descriptions.
[00:07:43] And look, I'm a writer.
[00:07:46] I've been published.
[00:07:46] I couldn't write something as good as the one that I did for myself.
[00:07:49] And by the way, just to give you an idea of how well this worked for me, I sold my home
[00:07:54] and my condo in two days.
[00:07:56] And it was not because I had it priced correctly.
[00:07:59] I assure you I didn't.
[00:08:00] I had it priced higher than it should have been.
[00:08:02] In fact, in my condo building, and this is by the way in November, right?
[00:08:06] Which is not a good time to be selling a condo in Chicago in particular.
[00:08:10] And it sold for the highest amount that had ever been sold for a two bedroom condo in my building.
[00:08:17] So I actually effectively raised the property value of pretty much everyone else's condo
[00:08:21] in there.
[00:08:21] So they're obviously loving that.
[00:08:23] So I don't know how much it could be.
[00:08:25] We could say it was because of the listing description, but it certainly didn't hurt.
[00:08:29] I also spent a fortune on photos, which I encourage everybody to do.
[00:08:33] That's probably the most important thing.
[00:08:34] But the listing description was really, really cool.
[00:08:36] So please go in and try it.
[00:08:39] Let me know your feedback.
[00:08:40] Tell other agents about it.
[00:08:42] And if it starts getting too expensive and I have to start charging, you know, I will,
[00:08:45] but I don't think I'll have to do that now.
[00:08:47] So listing.joincail.com.
[00:08:48] Hope everybody has a wonderful holiday season.
[00:08:51] I'm going to keep building these tools for you.
[00:08:53] And thank you for listening.
[00:08:55] I always like to sort of give these things to our guests or to our listeners and our guests.
[00:09:00] So thank you again.
[00:09:01] Please tell other agents about the podcast.
[00:09:03] Continue to listen.
[00:09:04] We love your support.
[00:09:05] And thank you to our sponsors.
[00:09:06] Thank you to our team who puts all this together and does it tirelessly.
[00:09:10] And really, we just have the most fun doing this show.
[00:09:14] And really, I get so much wonderful feedback from the audience.
[00:09:17] So grateful for you.
[00:09:18] And hopefully you like this tool and hopefully it helps you.
[00:09:21] And tell other people about it and let me know.
[00:09:24] And if it stinks, you'll tell me that too, because I can always make it better.
[00:09:27] All right, guys, I will see you on the next episode.
[00:09:30] Thanks.
