[00:01:17] Today's episode is brought to you by corded.io. Are you looking for agents to join your brokerage
[00:01:24] or team? Now, as a real estate recruiter, I can tell you the answer is always yes. But most agents
[00:01:30] aren't looking to move right now. So how do you know who to contact? Well, what if I were to tell
[00:01:35] you there's a recruiting and retention tool powered by artificial intelligence that shows you
[00:01:40] exactly which agents in your local market are looking to leave their brokerage right now and
[00:01:45] which agents at your own firm are also looking to leave you? Now, I've been recruiting REALTORS for
[00:01:51] 15 years and I've hired over 2000 agents. I can tell you with no exaggeration, this is the tool
[00:01:58] I've been waiting for. Corded's AI looks for trends across dozens of variables for each agent in
[00:02:03] your market and shows you which agents they believe are likely to move. Not only does it do that,
[00:02:09] but corded's AI went and visited my recruiting website and read everything I offer. So now when I'm
[00:02:15] recruiting, corded's AI tells me exactly what to say based on that agent's needs and what my brokerage
[00:02:21] can offer. It even writes emails for me. I've never seen anything like it and I use it every single day.
[00:02:28] Now, if you are looking to grow your brokerage, corded.io is the best tool out there. Visit corded.io
[00:02:35] to schedule a demo again. That's corded.io. And now, onto the show.
[00:02:56] Hello and welcome to another episode of Keeping It Real, the largest podcast made by real estate
[00:03:01] agents and for real estate agents. My name is DJ Paris. I am your guide and host through the show.
[00:03:07] And I rarely talk about numbers, but I just wanted to say a very sincere and hearty thanks to
[00:03:12] everyone that has been with us for whether you're brand new to the show or gosh, I think all the way
[00:03:17] back seven years ago is when we started and we have now close to 700 episodes. But most importantly,

[00:03:38] Chicago area where I am, but don't worry if you're not because you'll still be able to benefit
[00:03:43] from this just in a different way. So for the first ever time, I've oh, and by the way, I've wanted
[00:03:48] to do this for years. We are doing our first live taping. This is coming up towards the end of July
[00:03:54] on the 27th, which is a Tuesday. We're doing it here in Lincoln Park. We'll have a live audience with

[00:04:40] even if you're not able to attend. But if you are, please attend. We'd love to see you and I'd
[00:04:44] love to meet you and shake your hands. So all right, guys, let's get to it. My conversation with
[00:04:49] the amazing, truly amazing New York City top producer, Lisa Litman.
[00:05:11] What is the best piece of advice you've ever received as a REALTOR?
[00:05:17] The best piece of advice I ever received was from a guy named Chris Peters who was a manager
[00:05:22] at Corcoran. He was teaching new training for new brokers. It was the winter of 1998. And I asked
[00:05:30] innocently what was his advice for somebody who wanted to do this part-time. And he laughed at me
[00:05:37] in front of everybody with kind of an evil laugh. And he said, if you want to do this part-time,
[00:05:42] get out of the business. So that was really good advice. And remember that that was back before
[00:05:48] people were using cell phones or email. So things move slower than it. And even back then he told me,
[00:05:54] don't try to do it part-time. Love that. What's the worst piece of advice you've ever received?
[00:06:01] Well, I'm probably the worst advice I ever got was in that same training program. And I don't
[00:06:05] remember who gave this advice, but back then, I used to sometimes teach brokers that when you
[00:06:10] worked with buyers, back then in New York, 80% of our inventory was something called a co-op.
[00:06:15] I know you guys have some of the Michikago too. And they taught me, they said, you know,
[00:06:20] when you meet a client before you take them out to show them properties, find out how much money
[00:06:24] they have and how much money they make and get all that information up front. And I remember
[00:06:31] thinking to myself, wow, I can't do that when I first meet somebody because that would be very
[00:06:37] off-putting if somebody said that to me. And I don't feel comfortable doing that. So what I do,
[00:06:44] what I think about how I manage my business and when I teach new brokers, I say, you have to
[00:06:50] be true to yourself. So if something doesn't feel comfortable to you, then that's probably, you're
[00:06:56] probably not going to be good at it. And I have gotten to where I was by, I guess, sometimes taking
[00:07:02] chance and taking somebody out and showing them properties and finding out that maybe they had less
[00:07:08] money than or didn't have enough money to buy what they were hoping to buy or maybe they couldn't
[00:07:13] buy a co-op, maybe they had to buy a condo. I will tell you probably net net people end up having
[00:07:19] more money than I thought they had in the first place. Most people don't want to waste their time
[00:07:23] and be embarrassed. But I would say that was pretty bad advice, I thought. Yeah, I love that. So for
[00:07:29] those of us that don't have worked with condos, I'm assuming Lisa the reason why you got that
[00:07:35] advice is because people have to go in front of the co-op board. I'm sorry, did I say co-op?
[00:07:41] Yeah, the co-op board. And then they have a little interview and they have to pass the sort of
[00:07:46] smell test. And it's my sister had that. She lived in the West Loop, or sorry, West Loop, in the West
[00:07:53] West Village for a number of years on Barrow Street. And so she had that to go through that as well.
[00:08:00] And she passed with flying colors, but it is something that is an extra step. We do have them in
[00:08:04] Chicago, not as common, obviously, as you have in Manhattan. But yeah, I love that too because
[00:08:10] you're right, not everybody wants to share that information upfront. It's not an easy question
[00:08:14] to ask upfront. And it seems like it's worked out okay for you that you haven't asked those
[00:08:19] questions upfront. Yeah, yeah. All right, today our guest is Lisa Kay Lippman. She is a nationally
[00:08:27] recognized industry leader with over 27 years of experience in real estate. Last year, she closed
[00:08:32] get this transactions exceeding $300 million further solidifying her position as the number one
[00:08:40] agent at Brown Harris Stevens for the ninth consecutive year. That is a very big deal. We've had
[00:08:47] lots of Brown Harris Stevens agents on the show, but we've never had number one. So we're super
[00:08:52] excited to have Lisa on. She is known for her deep understanding of the economic factors influencing
[00:08:57] the real estate market. And Lisa is also a trusted advisor to both buyers and sellers. Follow her
[00:09:03] on Instagram Lisa Kay Lippman. That's Lippman with two P's and one N. We will have a link to that
[00:09:10] in the show notes. Lisa Kay Lippman on Instagram Lisa. Welcome to keeping it real. Thank you.
[00:09:16] I am so excited to chat with you because by the way, I was looking at your current offerings. And
[00:09:22] yes, of course, Manhattan, all the prices are a lot higher than a lot of other places. And so it's
[00:09:29] always a little bit of sticker shock to see no matter what other market you might be in. But boy,
[00:09:33] you have a lot of really impressive properties. So I want to get into the sort of luxury world and
[00:09:39] how you how you sort of built your business. And I know you don't exclusively work there. You do
[00:09:45] other types of properties, but you certainly have a lot of really high end luxury listings in our
[00:09:50] audience. We'd love to hear about how they might want to think about getting into luxury. But before
[00:09:55] we get to that, I want to hear your story because you were a lawyer and you made a switch. So we
[00:10:02] don't often hear that story. So let's find out how and why did you make the transition from law
[00:10:08] into real estate? So I made the transition sort of accidentally. I was a lawyer for five years.
[00:10:15] And I really enjoyed being a lawyer. I was a litigator. And I have my first child who's going to be 31
[00:10:20] next week. And I tried doing it part time after he was born. So that was 1994. And back then, the
[00:10:28] concept of a woman working part time was very different than it is now. So basically, they were
[00:10:33] paying me for three days, but making me come in five days, there was obviously no remote work.
[00:10:39] And it was frustrating. And I was getting worse, less interesting work because I wasn't there as
[00:10:45] much and able to go to court as much. So I stopped working. I had my son who is 28. And I was not
[00:10:52] working for almost a year, not even full year. When I just realized that I did not, it was not great
[00:10:59] for me being home full time. I was annoyed that my now ex-husband was asking me how much I had
[00:11:04] spent at the pharmacy that day and bugging me about, you know, any money I spend and that that
[00:11:09] wasn't working well for me. So we had just bought an apartment. And I was kind of curious about it.
[00:11:14] And in New York, you're automatically licensed as a broker if you're a lawyer because what you
[00:11:19] learn in property law is, I guess, about what you learn in that course. So I walked into a
[00:11:24] corporate office. I'm a Broadway near where I lived. And I said, hi, I'm a lawyer and I want to do
[00:11:29] this part time. And they said, you're hired. So I entered that training program that I referred to
[00:11:34] before where I get yelled at. And I started. And I started the old fashioned way. Back then, you
[00:11:43] didn't really join teams. There weren't so many teams. We didn't have the internet. So we had
[00:11:49] something called floor duty. It was a store for an office, which is why I walked into it. And I sat
[00:11:54] in the front and I sat there on the weekends and people came in looking for a broker. So one
[00:12:00] woman came in, she was getting divorced and she was looking for a rental. And one couple came in,
[00:12:05] they were moving downtown and they wanted to sell their one bedroom on the upper west side.
[00:12:09] So those were my two first pieces of business. And then I was at a fundraiser a few weeks after that.
[00:12:16] And I met this couple and they said that maybe they'd buy an apartment in Manhattan. They were
[00:12:20] unsure. They lived in Westchester and I said, oh, you know, I'd love to show you apartments. They
[00:12:25] said, well, we don't want to promise you. We may end up wasting your time. I said, it's fine. I knew
[00:12:29] let me learn. I'd love to show you properties. And they did buy something back then. It was a
[00:12:34] $1.6 million. It was a ton of money back then. It was 1998. And from there, my business grew.
[00:12:43] And that's how I got into it. So I stayed at Corcoran until March of 2005. And then I left and
[00:12:50] I came to Brown Harris where I've been for 20 years. Amazing. I'm amazed that people go all the way
[00:12:58] through law school, pass the board and pass the bar. And then, you know, sometimes go, I think I
[00:13:07] want to try something else because law school is misery and passing the bar is misery and you did it
[00:13:13] and then found a different calling. And you were a litigator. You did fun stuff. And still, yeah, I
[00:13:19] love that. You were able to make that transition. My girlfriend, who's a litigator as well. She,
[00:13:25] and she's passed actually, she did the bar in two states. So she had double the fun. And
[00:13:31] also had my bar in Connecticut. Oh, God, so you know, you know how much fun that is. And so she,
[00:13:37] even today, she loves what she does. She's like, if I had to do it all over again, I don't know.
[00:13:43] I don't know if it's as much as she loves it. She's like, I don't know if all the pain and
[00:13:47] suffering was worth it. But I love the fact that you have transitioned in really just blossomed into,
[00:13:54] you know, again, a career that most anyone can start really, you know, the barrier to entry is very low.
[00:14:01] And yes, a lot of attorneys end up getting their license. You know, Illinois, we have a similar
[00:14:05] structure where you still have to take the test, but you know, it's not certainly not as difficult
[00:14:09] as passing the bar. So a lot of attorneys get their license just because and they end up doing
[00:14:14] real estate as well. But very few are like, I'm going to hang up my, hang up my law, my law degree,
[00:14:19] and you know, end up doing this full time. So we know you made the switch. It seemed like it was
[00:14:25] a good fit. We've heard about how you received your first two clients. And yeah, the times have
[00:14:30] obviously changed. Although maybe in Manhattan, not as much because of course, people are still
[00:14:35] walking around and walking into into into shops and businesses. So the rest of us who don't get
[00:14:43] walk in traffic, obviously are, you know, building our businesses in different ways. And were you
[00:14:49] born and raised in New York as well? Or did you come from somewhere else? Well, I grew up in New Haven,
[00:14:54] which isn't so far away, but I was not a New Yorker. I mean, my connections were amazingly that I
[00:14:59] had gone to college at the University of Pennsylvania. So I knew people who had moved to New York.
[00:15:04] I went to law school in New York City. But you know, I would say that being a lawyer and having
[00:15:13] gone to Penn probably was helpful to me. But I really, I built my business sort of the old
[00:15:19] fashion way where so I had these three first pieces of business are rental for $7,000,
[00:15:24] a one bedroom for $800,000, and a two bedroom or a three bedroom for a million six. And I started
[00:15:32] just working and you know, one thing fed into another. And back then people couldn't look you up
[00:15:38] on the web. So I got some repeat business right away, word of mouth a little bit. I did for duty.
[00:15:46] I did open houses. I just met people. I mean, one of my biggest clients to this day is somebody that
[00:15:52] I met in an open house. I had a listing and I did an open house on Sunday and somebody came in.
[00:15:57] They didn't want to buy that property. But they ended up working with me and over the time
[00:16:03] referred me business. I mean, I got a lot of business that way. You know, nowadays I get a lot
[00:16:07] of business because people find me on the web. But I still have a lot of repeat business. I mean,
[00:16:13] I've been doing this long enough that I have now people who are buying their third property for me,
[00:16:17] you know, each time it's bigger, right? And I think that when people think about growing their
[00:16:26] business, I think sometimes people are too anxious to say, well, how do you sell the $10 million
[00:16:30] properties? And it doesn't really work that way. You know, you have to, it's stepping stones and
[00:16:39] it's building blocks. And you have to think about the $10 million client and think to yourself, would
[00:16:45] a $10 million client want to give a newbie their business? Probably not. That's a lot of sense.
[00:16:52] So when people say to me, well, how did you break into the upper echelons of the price points?
[00:16:58] I tell them it's with experience, right? It's with a lot of hard work. And if you would look at my
[00:17:04] career over the last 27 years, there's been a trajectory of slow and steady every year. The average
[00:17:12] price point has gone up. But importantly, you have to still maintain your business on lower price
[00:17:20] points because you have to service other people connected to the higher price point.
[00:17:24] Sure. And the other thing that I've learned, which has been really important in any, in any economy,
[00:17:31] is the times change, right? So after 9-11, we had a few dead months and things went crazy.
[00:17:37] After the financial crisis, there were two years that nothing sold. So I did rentals because I
[00:17:50] was a child. So I would say that, you know, I once saw this TED talk by this woman, I can't
[00:17:54] think of her name, but she talked about who is successful, right? Is it the smartest? Is it the
[00:17:59] most connected? Whatever. And one of the things that determines whether people are going to be successful
[00:18:04] is how scrappy they are, right? How hard they work, how hungry they are. And I would describe
[00:18:11] myself as being intelligent, all those other things, but I'm scrappy. You know, I do work that's
[00:18:17] in front of me. And if things change, I change with it. Yeah, pivoting. You're talking about being
[00:18:23] flexible, malleable. I mean, look, you started in a completely different career that doesn't easily
[00:18:30] lend itself to switching, right? You went through a lot of sweat equity to get that logic
[00:18:37] degree. And then basically said, I'm completely changing because I have faith I could do this other
[00:18:42] thing. And, and then you did because and maybe even going through law school, getting to law school,
[00:18:49] going through it, passing the bar in two states, maybe that also gave you a sense of like, I can kind
[00:18:55] of maybe not everything, I can't do everything, but I could do a lot. And it probably gave you this
[00:19:00] idea that if I had to start all over and do something else I could and you did, and I think that is,
[00:19:07] you know, really amazing that you did. I imagine if you could go back and change it, you wouldn't
[00:19:11] probably change anything. You just, you know, you ended up all working out just perfectly. I want to
[00:19:18] know, and this is often a question we get from our listeners about top agencies, they go, what do
[00:19:24] they do every day, right? And of course, every day is different and you're, you know, running around,
[00:19:29] replying to clients, handling your existing, you know, relationships, and, you know, obviously looking
[00:19:35] for new business too, but do you have a regular sort of flow to your day, obviously knowing that
[00:19:42] things change, but are there some daily habits that you still employ today that maybe we even started
[00:19:48] doing 20 years ago? Yeah, I don't know that I have kind of a checklist of things that I've,
[00:19:54] that I've been doing for many years, but I would say that, you know, if you look at most successful
[00:19:58] people, they get up pretty early in the morning and they get going pretty quickly. So I get up early,
[00:20:06] I drink my coffee in the kitchen and I check emails. And if I know that somebody's around to talk
[00:20:13] and they need to talk, I might call them at 730 in the morning, if I know that person likes to talk
[00:20:17] early. So I would say that I get a lot of work done pretty early via email. I will often send emails
[00:20:25] to my team members saying, let's make sure to do this, let's make sure to do that. A lot of the
[00:20:30] thoughts I have that I put down in, you know, in an email in the morning, I have thought about
[00:20:35] before I went to bed, I'll be honest. Sometimes before I've gotten out of bed, most mornings for me
[00:20:43] start out with a workout. That's like really important part of my day. I've been doing that since
[00:20:48] probably senior year of college. It puts order into my day, gives me energy. I think I have a lot
[00:20:56] of like nervous energy and some anxiety like a lot of people do. And that is the best thing for me
[00:21:03] to release that anxiety to make me feel better and clear headed. So that would be what I would say,
[00:21:09] the two things that the three things that are sort of happen every day is drinking coffee,
[00:21:14] checking email, organizing my day and working out. The rest can go in many different directions.
[00:21:23] The rest of the day, and one of the things I love about my job is that no days look exactly alike.
[00:21:28] Like today, I've actually been in the office a lot, which is great because it's 100 degrees here
[00:21:32] in New York. So I haven't minded at all. But I didn't have that many appointments because people
[00:21:38] cancel because of the heat. So I've been doing a lot of catching up on things that I had to do,
[00:21:44] bored that I'm on, just checking things that I sometimes don't have a chance to check at the office.
[00:21:50] But my day consists of speaking to clients, both buyers and sellers, checking new listings,
[00:21:55] checking my listings to make sure that they're looking the best, thinking of ideas of how I can
[00:22:00] repackage them, remark at them, thinking about marking ideas. And thinking about different kinds
[00:22:09] of outreach. And then also I read the paper every day. It's not always first thing in the morning,
[00:22:15] but I do read the paper every day. Nowadays, we all get a lot of news within our email. If it's
[00:22:22] something that I enjoy reading or I find relevant, I'll read those emails, other ones I delete. I try
[00:22:28] to stay really focused on work and task the hand during the day. I think people of my generation,
[00:22:35] I'm 60 years old, are probably a little bit better at that than some of the younger generation.
[00:22:41] You know, I'm just never on Instagram or Facebook during the day. It's not my habit, it's not my
[00:22:46] interest. To me, I would find it disruptive. The people who work for me mainly are under 30 or 31.
[00:22:54] And I have one person who is older than 40 and one person who's my age. They're not, I don't
[00:23:01] find that they have that issue, but the younger people I often will see are on social media during
[00:23:05] the day. And I actually did a test for them like a challenge a few months ago. I said to anybody
[00:23:12] who can stay off of social media for five days in a row gets a $1,500 bonus at the end of the five days.
[00:23:19] But if you make it two days and then you go on, oh, this is between nine and five. If you break it,
[00:23:25] the five days starts again. And the feedback was amazing. I mean, one of my teammates said to me,
[00:23:33] I actually was less depressed. I felt better when I was on during the day. So I think they learned
[00:23:41] something about themselves. So I think that that's probably a little bit of advice that I'll throw
[00:23:45] out there to people. You know, we're all multitask. That's the way the world is. But the fact is,
[00:23:51] is we can't multitask that well. Absolutely. The data is clear. We can't really multitask at all,
[00:23:58] right? Very few of us are able to be effective in that way. And to talk about social media for a
[00:24:04] second, because we don't really talk about it all that much on our show other than how to be
[00:24:09] successful using social media. But when we talk about being successful, we're talking about how to
[00:24:14] actually interact with your sphere on social media. And if you're doing that and you're you're really
[00:24:20] trying to deepen relationships, great. That's a good use of your time in social media. But if you're
[00:24:25] going there to consume, consume content, Lisa's, you know, really talking about then, you know, how
[00:24:32] useful is that? And yeah, I am so grateful. I'm sure you are as well that you and I did not grow up
[00:24:38] with social media. So we don't really have those habits. And I really feel for the younger people
[00:24:43] who grew up with it because how could you not be addicted to it if you've been on it, you know,
[00:24:47] since you were 10 years old or even younger, it's of course people are addicted. And I think that's
[00:24:52] a great point. So, you know, and you're right too. The other thing I find when I do go on social
[00:24:59] media, which is very rare is I don't feel as good about myself. I look at things I don't have. I look
[00:25:04] at people on vacations that I'm not at. I look at people further along in life, at least according
[00:25:10] to the picture I'm seeing. Maybe they're not actually, but it looks like they're further along.
[00:25:15] And I feel less than. And I can't, I don't know how anybody doesn't feel that way. They're at
[00:25:20] dinners. I'm not at it. And it really does. It's hard to maintain my own sense of like, I'm doing
[00:25:25] great. When I see everybody posting their best selves over and over and over. Nobody's posting,
[00:25:31] you know, the arguments and the fights and the mistakes and the failures. And of course, those,
[00:25:36] that's really more of what, of what, you know, normal life is like anyway. So yeah, I'm with you
[00:25:42] on that. I think if you find yourself consuming social media daily and you don't find that it's
[00:25:49] helpful, you know, if it's a few minutes here and there, fine, but if it's taking away time from
[00:25:54] things that you want to do, then try to stretch a bit and feel the anxiety that maybe you would
[00:26:01] feel that you social media would sort of soothe you from and learn how to cope with that anxiety or
[00:26:07] maybe go workout. I do the same thing. I work out not every day, but I work out three days a week.
[00:26:12] And I didn't realize how nervous, how much nervous energy I had like you were saying before I
[00:26:17] started exercising. And I don't like to exercise. It's not something I would choose to do, but it is
[00:26:23] a really good idea for me. And as much as I hate to do pushups and pullups and wall sits and all the
[00:26:30] awful things you have to do in the gym, it's a really good idea. And so I try to do things that are
[00:26:36] good ideas. And so Lisa, thank you for all of that. I want to ask you a little bit about sort of
[00:26:43] process. And so a couple of things that I think is always interesting. So a lot of times agents
[00:26:51] who aren't playing in the luxury space yet think, well, if I just had that $10 million
[00:26:56] listing, boy, all my problems would be solved. It's kind of like if I just won the lottery,
[00:27:00] all my problems would be solved. It's like, I don't know. I don't know that's true because
[00:27:04] there's a whole host of challenges that come with listing luxury properties. Number one,
[00:27:08] not that many people are walking around that can afford to buy a $10,000 property. So if you're
[00:27:14] representing the seller, you might get lucky and someone sees it and then just buys. But a lot of
[00:27:18] times you have to go out and source the buyers yourself or you have to network with those other
[00:27:23] agents who play in that space as well. So it's really brings on a different type of challenge.
[00:27:29] So can you speak a little bit to that? That how is luxury different from the non-luxury market?
[00:27:36] Well, it's a little bit hard to describe. And I think that because I came to this,
[00:27:43] sort of organically and slowly, you know, so I started in this business when I was 34 and
[00:27:51] 34, 33. And now I'm 60. I'd sort of have this natural progression where I started with smaller
[00:27:58] listings and I've gotten to larger listings. So now I'm sort of like the old woman in the office
[00:28:02] with all of the knowledge and all of this experience and it feels comfortable for me.
[00:28:09] But I will say that every time I sort of jumped and got that next bigger listing, it was, it felt,
[00:28:17] it was, I was nervous, you know, it felt like a challenge. And I think what you have to do is
[00:28:23] you have to lean into it. You have to lean into the fact that it's a new challenge for you.
[00:28:28] And you really have to study how you're going to market or deal with somebody who's at a higher
[00:28:35] praise point and make sure that you know all of the competition that's at that praise point,
[00:28:40] whether you're working with a buyer at that praise point or a seller, make sure you know what
[00:28:44] else is out there. That's super important. And you want to make sure that everything you're
[00:28:51] doing is appropriate for that property. Now some of these things I'm going to mention seem
[00:28:57] really stupid. But if you're showing a $10 million property in a fancy neighborhood, I don't think
[00:29:04] you should show up in your gym clothes. Now I don't think you should show up in your gym clothes
[00:29:08] to show anything, but that's probably the 60 year old lawyer in the speaking. But I do think
[00:29:15] that there's a level of sophistication that comes with a different praise point. So for instance,
[00:29:24] in my office, I have a role that the guys should wear, you know, um, work shirts. And if we have an
[00:29:33] important meeting, they should wear a jacket. We've given up on the ties. Um, well, you know,
[00:29:38] no jeans, no shorts. Um, and that's because we're working at a certain level that I think that
[00:29:45] that's super important. Um, I also have rules like no being on your phone while you're showing a
[00:29:52] property. Now, should you not do that when you're showing a half a million dollar studio apartment,
[00:29:57] you shouldn't, but certainly not if you're showing a $10 million property. Um, and I think that
[00:30:03] all those things make a big difference. And I'll just tell you briefly that I took over the last five
[00:30:08] listings, um, and a new building on the Upper East Side from a different agency. And, um, I sold the
[00:30:15] three largest ones with a contract out on the fourth, largest one, um, within two months. And they
[00:30:21] hadn't been able to sell them in a really, really long time. Um, one of the reasons why is that I
[00:30:26] think that I was able to work with the buyer pool better because I understood the buyer pool. These
[00:30:33] were all over $11 million. And, um, we presented our marketing and our salesmanship in a very high
[00:30:41] and sophisticated way. Yeah. But, you know, that's come with hard work. Yeah, you know, I like that you
[00:30:49] spoke about sort of the aesthetic piece because of course, knowledge, experience, presentation, um,
[00:30:55] all of that is so important. But you do also have to consider how you appear physically, right? And so
[00:31:02] you're talking about showing up well dressed, um, showing up in a professional manner. Attorneys are
[00:31:07] kind of the last group that is still holding on to the suits. And I kind of like it. Um, and in fact,
[00:31:13] my, my girlfriend has a fantasy that in the future that in courts, they can all wear robes. So they
[00:31:20] would be all equal that she's like, that'll probably never happen. But, um, but, you know, she has to
[00:31:25] wear the fancy business suits as well. But it is, uh, it is something that I always think I always
[00:31:31] kind of look at things in life. I don't know if you feel the same way. This, what's the downside?
[00:31:36] Right. So I look at things like, um, you know, I go, well, if I go to the gym, what's the downside?
[00:31:41] Well, a little bit of time, I'm not going to want to do it. It hurts. It's like super uncomfortable.
[00:31:47] It's painful. But that's it. That's really it. And then there's like a million upsides. If I,
[00:31:53] if I volunteer somewhere, what's the downside? A little bit of time. And I get all these, you know,
[00:31:57] benefits. If I follow up with my clients, if I dress well, if I pay attention to, you know,
[00:32:04] somebody during a listing instead of being on my phone, what's the downside? Maybe I miss out on
[00:32:09] a couple of Instagram posts, right? Who cares? And so I love that, that you sort of are intentional
[00:32:14] about the way you present yourself because it is really important. You know, I don't want to go out
[00:32:19] with a professional who's, uh, distracted. I want to go out with a professional that looks
[00:32:24] professional. And again, you know, nobody really wants to put on suits and ties. And we don't
[00:32:30] want to do that. But, you know, oh, well, you know, it's going to most likely project an image
[00:32:36] that is, of course, you know, something that people will think, wow, this person at least takes
[00:32:41] their job seriously. And so I agree that, of course, you have to be really good at your job too.
[00:32:47] But, you know, making sure that the whole package is really well presented is, uh, is so important.
[00:32:54] I have a question about communication. So I am always curious when, you know, whether it's a luxury
[00:33:01] client or not, I'm sure you treat all your clients the same. Of course you do. How often are you
[00:33:07] communicating? Let's talk about listings. So you have sellers and, you know, whether the home is,
[00:33:13] you know, having eyeballs on it or people walking in and checking it out or not, how often are you
[00:33:19] communicating with these sellers to sort of give them updates? Do you have a process for that?
[00:33:24] Do you sort of do it on intuition or how does that work? It's a combination of both. So I do have
[00:33:30] a process. I try to send reports to all of my sellers every two to three weeks maximum. And
[00:33:36] that's a formal report that goes through how many times we've shown the property, how many times
[00:33:40] we've had repeat viewings, all the advertising that we've done. And then, um, click through links
[00:33:46] showing where their apartment or property is featured so that they have it all in front of them.
[00:33:52] Um, then I also try to, you know, depending on the person, I try to give feedback after I show
[00:34:00] their property. If it's a property you're showing a ton. Sometimes that's hard to do. But I do try,
[00:34:06] especially, you know, nowadays it takes two seconds to write a text or an email to somebody.
[00:34:11] I really do try to give feedback after I've shown the property. Even if it's just two lines,
[00:34:16] that was a good showing or that showing didn't seem that problem is saying or whatever. You know,
[00:34:21] sometimes you don't always have feedback right away. Um, and I'm sure that I have clients who feel
[00:34:26] that I'm not in touch with them as much. Um, I'm sure that I have clients who feel that I'm in touch
[00:34:31] with them plenty. Um, I, but I, I do try to communicate as much as possible. And like I said, it's,
[00:34:37] it's somewhat organic. It's somewhat sort of just based on the situation. There is a process that
[00:34:43] we have also, um, and I do think being in communication with your clients is incredibly important.
[00:34:50] Yeah. I also want to switch over to buyers for a second because right now, you know,
[00:34:57] rates are certainly higher than anyone would really prefer. They're not traditionally, uh,
[00:35:02] all that high, but certainly as compared to the three person that days of, of before and,
[00:35:07] oh boy, you know, it's funny. It was such a great thing for all of us that owned or bought during
[00:35:12] that time. But then it's also this, this sort of, um, you know, we're like handcuffed now to our
[00:35:18] properties. And, you know, it's not, it's not the most, um, painless experience to go from 3% to
[00:35:24] seven, seven percent, uh, these days, I'm going to have to make that, uh, just, I'm going to have to do
[00:35:29] that myself here, uh, in the next year. And it's going to, I'll be fine. But it's certainly, I
[00:35:34] understand why a lot of people are sitting on the sidelines. But when we talk about buyers,
[00:35:38] I just want to talk about one thing in particular because I always find that really successful agents
[00:35:44] do this a little differently than others. And I'm sure you see as a person who has a lot of listings,
[00:35:50] you probably see the full gamut of experience. I'm talking about presenting offers. So offers are
[00:35:56] typically sent via email. Um, you know, they're, they're, the email that sent. There is an attachment
[00:36:02] that's usually sent there. There's maybe text in the email, maybe not. And maybe there's a phone call
[00:36:07] that follows up with it. Maybe there's a text that follows up with it. Maybe not. Um, I just want to
[00:36:12] hear from you is what do you think are best practices when submitting an offer, whether it's a competitive
[00:36:18] environment or not? I always like to call the other agent and tell them I'm going to be submitting an
[00:36:23] offer. And then when I submit an offer, I do it by email. I see, see myself. I put in the first line,
[00:36:31] the subject line offer on the property so that they see it. You know, it's, it's visible in their
[00:36:36] inbox right away. Um, in New York, again, we have a lot of co-ops. So the people's financials are
[00:36:43] important. Um, but even if it's not a co-op, I think it's important to attach a financial statement
[00:36:50] or some financial information about the buyer. And then in the body of the offer, I like to put a
[00:36:57] little bit of information about the people, you know, what they do, how, where they live, if they
[00:37:02] have kids, if they have a dog, if they've owned before, um, those kinds of things. And, um, and then
[00:37:10] I usually follow up to make sure that they've gotten the offer. So I think, you know, presentation,
[00:37:17] communication is super important. And remember that a desperate seller will kind of hang on to any
[00:37:25] offer they get. But a seller who has, you know, a few different offers, you can really distinguish
[00:37:30] yourself by making the offer seem more serious and more viable, even if it's not the top offer. I
[00:37:38] mean, I will tell you that I'm now marketing a property for two million dollars and we have three
[00:37:43] different offers. And they were all around the same price. But one of them came in and just was
[00:37:51] much more professionally, um, presented than the others. And that was. So will you create like a,
[00:37:59] a, a title page or a page that sort of lists the bullet points, um, before you actually get into
[00:38:07] the meat of the contract, like here are the main points or it sounds like you sort of do a version
[00:38:12] of that in the offer. I do it. I mean, I don't do it with bullet points, but I usually, I have sort
[00:38:17] of a format in my head, you know, thank you for showing it to us. Appreciate your time. That's the
[00:38:22] first paragraph on behalf of my client. Please to present this offer. It's cash. It's contingent
[00:38:28] on financing. It's not contingent on financing. I give them some information about them. I
[00:38:32] follow and then next paragraph will be a little bit more information. And then I also will always say,
[00:38:37] you know, a next to this email is their pre-approved all their financial statement, whatever else you
[00:38:42] need as backup. Yeah. I love that. And I again, to you, this is like, of course, you should do it
[00:38:49] exactly this way. I imagine you see, and again, maybe in the luxury space, you see less of this,
[00:38:55] but certainly in the non-luxury space, you will see all sorts of offers coming in, sort of,
[00:39:01] you know, haggard offers, you know, hastily written, maybe no, you know, no sort of data points
[00:39:09] put in there, maybe nothing in the email at all other than the actual, you know, PDF that's in
[00:39:15] there. And, you know, it is amazing. I'm curious, how often, when you have a listing, does the agent
[00:39:23] present the offer via email, you know, follows it up with a phone call or starts with a phone call,
[00:39:29] sends a text, makes, you know, how often do you receive things in a way that you think that's a
[00:39:34] really, well, you just talked about the listing that you have now, that three of them, you said,
[00:39:38] one of them really looked good. How often do you receive them in a way where you're like that,
[00:39:42] that person did a good job? I would say that 85% of the time I do. I think that has to do with the
[00:39:49] fact that we have so many co-ops and that I'm also playing in a pretty high, high end of the market.
[00:39:56] So most of the brokers have some experience. But, you know, as you mentioned earlier on, the barrier
[00:40:02] to entry is very low in this job. And that doesn't mean that you have to have like, that you're
[00:40:11] necessarily better at this if you have a large degree than if you don't. But we're dealing with a
[00:40:19] lot of opportunities in New York City, whatever property, price point you're at, half a million,
[00:40:22] 15 million, right? It's all expensive. And it's a lot of money to whomever is working with you.
[00:40:28] So if you want to do well, whether you have a college degree or not, educate yourself in what you're
[00:40:35] doing so that you present yourself in a very sophisticated and knowledgeable way. Because some of
[00:40:42] the most successful brokers I know are not people that have business degrees from Harvard.
[00:40:46] Sure. And some of the least successful brokers are ones that do have business degrees from HBS.
[00:40:54] And I think to myself, oh my god, like what happened? So, you know, you can make yourself
[00:41:03] into a successful person by training yourself and learning your craft.
[00:41:09] Yeah, I don't obviously agree that is really great advice. I want to talk about in between sales.
[00:41:16] So you have the transaction. You do a great job. It closes. Everyone's happy.
[00:41:22] And now it's a seven year window before maybe the next transaction. What are you doing in those
[00:41:29] seven years to stay at least in touch with those clients? Like what does that look like?
[00:41:35] Well, so I always send a gift to somebody after they close. I try to think of something that they will
[00:41:40] enjoy lately. I've been doing a lot of like donations in someone's honor because I feel like a lot
[00:41:45] of my wealthy clients sort of have everything they need and find them a gift that they have to put
[00:41:51] on a shelf or a wine that they don't drink is like not necessary. So I'll find out like a charity
[00:41:58] that they're involved in. Then I send a Christmas card every year, a holiday card, I should say.
[00:42:05] For years I did the Zagat Restaurant Guide and then they stopped printing them and people stopped
[00:42:13] carrying around books. Anyway, everything was online. So now I get a holiday card from a charity. I've
[00:42:19] done share our strengths. No kid left behind like hungry children. I've done habitat for humanity.
[00:42:29] And it's a card, a holiday card that says that a donation has been made in the person's honor.
[00:42:35] And my list grows every year. I mean, have probably a thousand people on my list at this point.
[00:42:39] I spend you know, $10,000 to charity. But people appreciate it. People really appreciate it. I
[00:42:49] often get notes back, you know, thanks for the donation in my honor. And I think it means something
[00:42:53] to people. You know, I'm going to pause right there because you were the first person in 700 episodes
[00:42:59] to ever share that specific type of holiday card. So we all send holiday cards or a lot of us do.
[00:43:08] And you know, some of them are handwritten. Some of them aren't. And you know, holiday cards are
[00:43:13] kind of like, yeah, it's okay. It's great. But you know, a lot of people do it. But you're doing
[00:43:18] something a little different and something that is more impactful. And something that really touches
[00:43:25] people, which is I'm putting money back into this organization that I think is important. I'm doing
[00:43:38] kind of think, have I ever received a card where somebody made a donation? I mean, you'll see this
[00:43:43] sometimes when people passed away, though, the donations made in someone's honor to a particular
[00:43:47] type of organization that supports, you know, some sort of disease or condition. But you don't
[00:43:54] typically see it outside of that. And so I love that you do that. It's sort of, I think our audience
[00:44:01] could could blitz pass that without realizing the significance. Everybody wants to feel like they
[00:44:06] can contribute. And a lot of people are so busy and they don't do as much volunteer work or they
[00:44:11] don't donate as much as they probably would like to. And so any little thing like that that gets
[00:44:16] them a little closer to that experience is certainly going to have a positive effect. And I know
[00:44:22] you're not doing it to get business. You're doing it because it's the right thing to do. And you feel
[00:44:26] that it's important to you. And it's also something that really differentiates you from all the other
[00:44:32] agents who send, you know, a handwritten card, which is good. That's great too. And you're, I guess
[00:44:38] you're doing a version of that as well. But the donation I think is a really nice touch. And
[00:44:43] certainly is you going above and beyond to say, hey, I'm doing this, you know, after the sale
[00:44:49] with you and we're still a team basically. Right. Well, you know, this, the CEO of our company is
[00:44:57] a woman named Best Friedman. And one of the things that she always talks about is that this is a
[00:45:01] people business, right. And she's somebody who's very conscious of, you know, needy people and
[00:45:08] the world that we live in. And I grew up in a family where giving back was very important. And
[00:45:16] so if you look at my Instagram too, like I definitely show some of my properties. I don't brag
[00:45:22] about where I go on vacation. Once in a while, I may show a picture of me and my kids saying,
[00:45:26] you know, this was a fun Christmas to be with my kids. I'm so happy, you know, but that's kind of like
[00:45:31] a rare few and far between. I try to put messages in my Instagram post, you know, I might show pretty
[00:45:39] nature and mention, you know, save the planet, appreciate the nature, appreciate your neighbor.
[00:45:46] It's all sort of the same concept. Like all of us, the way all of us live, everybody listening to this,
[00:45:52] we're all lucky, right. We all have a decent place to live. We're all getting to enjoy a job in a
[00:46:02] free world, a free country. We can complain about a lot of things. We're all really lucky. And
[00:46:06] I don't take any of that from granted. So I feel like we all need to give back because if everybody
[00:46:12] gave back, we could make the world a better place. And that's just something I really stick to.
[00:46:18] And I really believe in and going back to this being a people person, like, you know,
[00:46:24] I like to work with people who understand that and hopefully people like to work with me because
[00:46:28] that's important to me. So it goes back to being true to who you are, right. I mean, you know,
[00:46:35] I'm giving advice on working hard and being professional and being present and being respectful,
[00:46:40] but be who you are. You know, don't be afraid to be who you are.
[00:46:43] Yep. And you know, this idea of again, what's the downside? So you should, if you're not currently
[00:46:50] contributing in a way that's meaningful to you with an organization, you know, really consider
[00:46:56] doing that. What are you passionate about? And start thinking about how you can volunteer time
[00:47:01] or money with those organizations because number one, it's going to make you feel better. And it's
[00:47:07] a nice thing to do outside of the grind of this job. Also, it's going to, you know,
[00:47:13] certainly not going to look unfavorable to your clients, not that you would be bragging about,
[00:47:18] I'd do this volunteer work, but to let people know that you support certain organizations,
[00:47:22] that is a very powerful thing because people respond very favorably, of course, to people that
[00:47:27] contribute. And so it's again, it's what's the downside a little bit of time, a little bit of money,
[00:47:32] but you get to feel great, regardless, and people respond well, and you know, you're doing good
[00:47:38] in the world. So I'm a huge, huge fan of that. I wish I would have learned that lesson sooner in
[00:47:43] life. I've been, you know, contributing probably for about 20 plus years, but I wish I would have
[00:47:49] started in my early 20s. I was a little maybe more self-absorbed at that time and didn't realize how
[00:47:54] much I could give, but it really is a great suggestion. And I appreciate you sharing that with us.
[00:48:03] And I want to talk, it also too, I like that you are not posting on social media about all of your
[00:48:09] major, you know, sort of personal successes. Like here, here I am on this wonderful vacation,
[00:48:14] because at the end of the day, you know, I mean, maybe friends and family kind of would like to see,
[00:48:20] you know, pictures of you, and you can send those to people privately, of course. But I always do
[00:48:24] get a little, I don't want to, you know, I was just in Seattle with my girlfriend for the weekend.
[00:48:30] We were just there just to sort of enjoy Seattle. And we were there last weekend. And I was thinking
[00:48:34] of posting and then I go, if I post a bunch of pictures of us doing Seattle stuff, that's cute and
[00:48:39] whatever it's fine. But am I really just kind of showing off a little bit like, look at me, I was in
[00:48:44] Seattle. And like, what is my intention here? Like, I already sent them to my friends and family
[00:48:49] privately. And do I need the world to know that I want to see out of like, who cares? And so
[00:48:54] I sort of am with you there as I don't, I think we tend to want to, you know, I guess the point is,
[00:49:03] think about what's the intention, right? What's the intention of this post? Is it to boost my ego?
[00:49:09] Is it to get people to think I'm this really amazing, cool thing? Or is it in a way that's,
[00:49:14] you know, contributing to something? And I think, yeah, the world would be a lot better if we thought
[00:49:19] about how do we contribute versus how do we impress? So I appreciate you doing that. Lisa, I want to
[00:49:26] finish with just a piece of advice. So you work with a lot of agents, you've seen agents come and go,
[00:49:33] you've seen agents succeed, others not succeed. And a lot of agents right now are struggling because
[00:49:40] markets not in its, you know, most perfect state, of course. And, you know, agents are suffering
[00:49:47] right now. So for anyone out there that's just needs a little boost. What would you suggest that
[00:49:52] they should do if they don't, if they aren't flush with clients right now? So a few years ago,
[00:50:00] the guy who manages my office, who's been my manager for many years and he's now actually a
[00:50:05] co-president of the company, Kevin Koveski, said to me that there was a friend of mine who was
[00:50:11] working here and she had complained to him that she wasn't busy enough. And so he said to her,
[00:50:15] how many doors do you walk through a week? And it was a, it was a soft period. It might have been
[00:50:20] like after the financial crisis, you know? And she said, I don't know, I don't know what you mean.
[00:50:26] And he said, how many doors do you walk through? And he said, for instance, I bet if I would look
[00:50:32] at Lisa's week, she probably walks through 50 doors a week. And so that's my advice. All of us have
[00:50:40] gone through slower times. So what do you do? Don't sit at home waiting for the phone to ring. Just
[00:50:45] like when you were a teenager or in college, your mother told you not to sit at home and wait for
[00:50:50] the boy to call you, the girl to call you, right? Go out with your friends, do something, be busy,
[00:50:54] right? That's not, that's not going to make the phone ring. And it's the same thing. If you sit at
[00:50:59] your desk, the phones aren't going to ring quicker. Go walk through doors, go to open houses,
[00:51:07] preview properties that are being shown, walk through doors because you never know when you're going
[00:51:12] to be sitting next to somebody on the subway in a restaurant, in a sauna, wherever. And somebody
[00:51:20] says, oh, yeah, I've been looking, oh, you're a broker. I've been looking for a two-bedroom and
[00:51:24] I really want to have a swimming pool. And if you may be able to say, oh, my God, that's so interesting.
[00:51:29] Yesterday I went and saw this great apartment in a building that has a swimming pool. And I
[00:51:35] have gotten business that way because I put myself out there looking at things and you know,
[00:51:44] life is all about opportunities, right? The more opportunities we make for ourselves, the more they
[00:51:50] come together, the more people you know, the more people you meet, the more people you know, the more
[00:51:56] stories you know. So you have to put yourself out there, go through doors, walk through doors.
[00:52:01] If you're a new agent, ask a busy broker in your office if you can help in an open house.
[00:52:07] Yes. You know, be the greeter in a brownstone where there's no dormant in New York. You know,
[00:52:12] we have lots of dormant members. We also have buildings that where you have to like be there when
[00:52:15] somebody needs to go up to the to the walk-up or put yourself out there. That is how you are going
[00:52:21] to make opportunities for yourself. They don't just come and fall on our laps. We have to keep looking
[00:52:27] for them. Yeah, I wish they would fall at my lap, but they just hasn't happened for me yet.
[00:52:33] I don't want yours. Yeah, you're 100% right. Lisa Kay Lippman is our guest. Today,

And now on to our show. Today's episode is brought to you by corded.io. Are you looking for agents to join your brokerage or team? Now, as a real estate recruiter, I can tell you the answer is always yes. But most agents aren't looking to move right now. So how do you know who to contact? Well, what if I were to tell you there's a recruiting and retention tool powered by artificial intelligence that shows you exactly which agents in your local market are looking to leave their brokerage right now and which agents at your own firm are also looking to leave you? Now, I've been recruiting REALTORS for 15 years and I've hired over 2000 agents. I can tell you with no exaggeration, this is the tool I've been waiting for. Corded's AI looks for trends across dozens of variables for each agent in your market and shows you which agents they believe are likely to move. Not only does it do that, but corded's AI went and visited my recruiting website and read everything I offer. So now when I'm recruiting, corded's AI tells me exactly what to say based on that agent's needs and what my brokerage can offer. It even writes emails for me. I've never seen anything like it and I use it every single day. Now, if you are looking to grow your brokerage, corded.io is the best tool out there. Visit corded.io to schedule a demo again. That's corded.io. And now, onto the show. Hello and welcome to another episode of Keeping It Real, the largest podcast made by real estate agents and for real estate agents. My name is DJ Paris. I am your guide and host through the show.

Now, this only applies if you are in the local Chicago area where I am, but don't worry if you're not because you'll still be able to benefit from this just in a different way. So for the first ever time, I've oh, and by the way, I've wanted to do this for years. We are doing our first live taping. This is coming up towards the end of July on the 27th, which is a Tuesday. We're doing it here in Lincoln Park. We'll have a live audience with top producer, Crystal Tran, who's going to talk all about how she grew her business. She's amazing. And she's been on the show before. And this way, you'll be able to sit in the audience, watch a live taping and actually ask questions to Crystal, which I'll be then asking her as well. So don't worry if you're not in Chicago because we're recording it. You'll be able to hear it. Just not live. Unfortunately, but if you are in the Chicago area and you would like to attend totally complimentary, of course, you go to keeping it real webinar.com. It's not a webinar. It's an in-person event, but that's the domain keeping it real webinar.com sign up. We have limited seats. So anyway, just wanted to say again, thanks for all of the years of support. Excited for this event and excited to share it with everybody, even if you're not able to attend. But if you are, please attend. We'd love to see you and I'd love to meet you and shake your hands. So all right, guys, let's get to it. My conversation with the amazing, truly amazing New York City top producer, Lisa Litman. What is the best piece of advice you've ever received as a REALTOR? The best piece of advice I ever received was from a guy named Chris Peters who was a manager at Corcoran. He was teaching new training for new brokers. It was the winter of 1998. And I asked innocently what was his advice for somebody who wanted to do this part-time. And he laughed at me in front of everybody with kind of an evil laugh. And he said, if you want to do this part-time, get out of the business. So that was really good advice. And remember that that was back before people were using cell phones or email. So things move slower than it. And even back then he told me, don't try to do it part-time. Love that. What's the worst piece of advice you've ever received? Well, I'm probably the worst advice I ever got was in that same training program. And I don't remember who gave this advice, but back then, I used to sometimes teach brokers that when you worked with buyers, back then in New York, 80% of our inventory was something called a co-op. I know you guys have some of the Michikago too. And they taught me, they said, you know, when you meet a client before you take them out to show them properties, find out how much money they have and how much money they make and get all that information up front. And I remember thinking to myself, wow, I can't do that when I first meet somebody because that would be very off-putting if somebody said that to me. And I don't feel comfortable doing that. So what I do, what I think about how I manage my business and when I teach new brokers, I say, you have to be true to yourself. So if something doesn't feel comfortable to you, then that's probably, you're probably not going to be good at it. And I have gotten to where I was by, I guess, sometimes taking chance and taking somebody out and showing them properties and finding out that maybe they had less money than or didn't have enough money to buy what they were hoping to buy or maybe they couldn't buy a co-op, maybe they had to buy a condo. I will tell you probably net net people end up having more money than I thought they had in the first place. Most people don't want to waste their time and be embarrassed. But I would say that was pretty bad advice, I thought. Yeah, I love that. So for those of us that don't have worked with condos, I'm assuming Lisa the reason why you got that advice is because people have to go in front of the co-op board. I'm sorry, did I say co-op? Yeah, the co-op board. And then they have a little interview and they have to pass the sort of smell test. And it's my sister had that. She lived in the West Loop, or sorry, West Loop, in the West West Village for a number of years on Barrow Street. And so she had that to go through that as well. And she passed with flying colors, but it is something that is an extra step. We do have them in Chicago, not as common, obviously, as you have in Manhattan. But yeah, I love that too because you're right, not everybody wants to share that information upfront. It's not an easy question to ask upfront. And it seems like it's worked out okay for you that you haven't asked those questions upfront. Yeah, yeah. All right, today our guest is Lisa Kay Lippman. She is a nationally recognized industry leader with over 27 years of experience in real estate. Last year, she closed get this transactions exceeding $300 million further solidifying her position as the number one agent at Brown Harris Stevens for the ninth consecutive year. That is a very big deal. We've had lots of Brown Harris Stevens agents on the show, but we've never had number one. So we're super excited to have Lisa on. She is known for her deep understanding of the economic factors influencing the real estate market. And Lisa is also a trusted advisor to both buyers and sellers. Follow her on Instagram Lisa Kay Lippman. That's Lippman with two P's and one N. We will have a link to that in the show notes. Lisa Kay Lippman on Instagram Lisa. Welcome to keeping it real. Thank you. I am so excited to chat with you because by the way, I was looking at your current offerings. And yes, of course, Manhattan, all the prices are a lot higher than a lot of other places. And so it's always a little bit of sticker shock to see no matter what other market you might be in. But boy, you have a lot of really impressive properties. So I want to get into the sort of luxury world and how you how you sort of built your business. And I know you don't exclusively work there. You do other types of properties, but you certainly have a lot of really high end luxury listings in our audience. We'd love to hear about how they might want to think about getting into luxury. But before we get to that, I want to hear your story because you were a lawyer and you made a switch. So we don't often hear that story. So let's find out how and why did you make the transition from law into real estate? So I made the transition sort of accidentally. I was a lawyer for five years. And I really enjoyed being a lawyer. I was a litigator. And I have my first child who's going to be 31 next week. And I tried doing it part time after he was born. So that was 1994. And back then, the concept of a woman working part time was very different than it is now. So basically, they were paying me for three days, but making me come in five days, there was obviously no remote work. And it was frustrating. And I was getting worse, less interesting work because I wasn't there as much and able to go to court as much. So I stopped working. I had my son who is 28. And I was not working for almost a year, not even full year. When I just realized that I did not, it was not great for me being home full time. I was annoyed that my now ex-husband was asking me how much I had spent at the pharmacy that day and bugging me about, you know, any money I spend and that that wasn't working well for me. So we had just bought an apartment. And I was kind of curious about it. And in New York, you're automatically licensed as a broker if you're a lawyer because what you learn in property law is, I guess, about what you learn in that course. So I walked into a corporate office. I'm a Broadway near where I lived. And I said, hi, I'm a lawyer and I want to do this part time. And they said, you're hired. So I entered that training program that I referred to before where I get yelled at. And I started. And I started the old fashioned way. Back then, you didn't really join teams. There weren't so many teams. We didn't have the internet. So we had something called floor duty. It was a store for an office, which is why I walked into it. And I sat in the front and I sat there on the weekends and people came in looking for a broker. So one woman came in, she was getting divorced and she was looking for a rental. And one couple came in, they were moving downtown and they wanted to sell their one bedroom on the upper west side. So those were my two first pieces of business. And then I was at a fundraiser a few weeks after that. And I met this couple and they said that maybe they'd buy an apartment in Manhattan. They were unsure. They lived in Westchester and I said, oh, you know, I'd love to show you apartments. They said, well, we don't want to promise you. We may end up wasting your time. I said, it's fine. I knew let me learn. I'd love to show you properties. And they did buy something back then. It was a $1.6 million. It was a ton of money back then. It was 1998. And from there, my business grew. And that's how I got into it. So I stayed at Corcoran until March of 2005. And then I left and I came to Brown Harris where I've been for 20 years. Amazing. I'm amazed that people go all the way through law school, pass the board and pass the bar. And then, you know, sometimes go, I think I want to try something else because law school is misery and passing the bar is misery and you did it and then found a different calling. And you were a litigator. You did fun stuff. And still, yeah, I love that. You were able to make that transition. My girlfriend, who's a litigator as well. She, and she's passed actually, she did the bar in two states. So she had double the fun. And also had my bar in Connecticut. Oh, God, so you know, you know how much fun that is. And so she, even today, she loves what she does. She's like, if I had to do it all over again, I don't know. I don't know if it's as much as she loves it. She's like, I don't know if all the pain and suffering was worth it. But I love the fact that you have transitioned in really just blossomed into, you know, again, a career that most anyone can start really, you know, the barrier to entry is very low. And yes, a lot of attorneys end up getting their license. You know, Illinois, we have a similar structure where you still have to take the test, but you know, it's not certainly not as difficult as passing the bar. So a lot of attorneys get their license just because and they end up doing real estate as well. But very few are like, I'm going to hang up my, hang up my law, my law degree, and you know, end up doing this full time. So we know you made the switch. It seemed like it was a good fit. We've heard about how you received your first two clients. And yeah, the times have obviously changed. Although maybe in Manhattan, not as much because of course, people are still walking around and walking into into into shops and businesses. So the rest of us who don't get walk in traffic, obviously are, you know, building our businesses in different ways. And were you born and raised in New York as well? Or did you come from somewhere else? Well, I grew up in New Haven, which isn't so far away, but I was not a New Yorker. I mean, my connections were amazingly that I had gone to college at the University of Pennsylvania. So I knew people who had moved to New York. I went to law school in New York City. But you know, I would say that being a lawyer and having gone to Penn probably was helpful to me. But I really, I built my business sort of the old fashion way where so I had these three first pieces of business are rental for $7,000, a one bedroom for $800,000, and a two bedroom or a three bedroom for a million six. And I started just working and you know, one thing fed into another. And back then people couldn't look you up on the web. So I got some repeat business right away, word of mouth a little bit. I did for duty. I did open houses. I just met people. I mean, one of my biggest clients to this day is somebody that I met in an open house. I had a listing and I did an open house on Sunday and somebody came in. They didn't want to buy that property. But they ended up working with me and over the time referred me business. I mean, I got a lot of business that way. You know, nowadays I get a lot of business because people find me on the web. But I still have a lot of repeat business. I mean, I've been doing this long enough that I have now people who are buying their third property for me, you know, each time it's bigger, right? And I think that when people think about growing their business, I think sometimes people are too anxious to say, well, how do you sell the $10 million properties? And it doesn't really work that way. You know, you have to, it's stepping stones and it's building blocks. And you have to think about the $10 million client and think to yourself, would a $10 million client want to give a newbie their business? Probably not. That's a lot of sense. So when people say to me, well, how did you break into the upper echelons of the price points? I tell them it's with experience, right? It's with a lot of hard work. And if you would look at my career over the last 27 years, there's been a trajectory of slow and steady every year. The average price point has gone up. But importantly, you have to still maintain your business on lower price points because you have to service other people connected to the higher price point. Sure. And the other thing that I've learned, which has been really important in any, in any economy, is the times change, right? So after 9-11, we had a few dead months and things went crazy. After the financial crisis, there were two years that nothing sold. So I did rentals because I was a child. So I would say that, you know, I once saw this TED talk by this woman, I can't think of her name, but she talked about who is successful, right? Is it the smartest? Is it the most connected? Whatever. And one of the things that determines whether people are going to be successful is how scrappy they are, right? How hard they work, how hungry they are. And I would describe myself as being intelligent, all those other things, but I'm scrappy. You know, I do work that's in front of me. And if things change, I change with it. Yeah, pivoting. You're talking about being flexible, malleable. I mean, look, you started in a completely different career that doesn't easily lend itself to switching, right? You went through a lot of sweat equity to get that logic degree. And then basically said, I'm completely changing because I have faith I could do this other thing. And, and then you did because and maybe even going through law school, getting to law school, going through it, passing the bar in two states, maybe that also gave you a sense of like, I can kind of maybe not everything, I can't do everything, but I could do a lot. And it probably gave you this idea that if I had to start all over and do something else I could and you did, and I think that is, you know, really amazing that you did. I imagine if you could go back and change it, you wouldn't probably change anything. You just, you know, you ended up all working out just perfectly. I want to know, and this is often a question we get from our listeners about top agencies, they go, what do they do every day, right? And of course, every day is different and you're, you know, running around, replying to clients, handling your existing, you know, relationships, and, you know, obviously looking for new business too, but do you have a regular sort of flow to your day, obviously knowing that things change, but are there some daily habits that you still employ today that maybe we even started doing 20 years ago? Yeah, I don't know that I have kind of a checklist of things that I've, that I've been doing for many years, but I would say that, you know, if you look at most successful people, they get up pretty early in the morning and they get going pretty quickly. So I get up early, I drink my coffee in the kitchen and I check emails. And if I know that somebody's around to talk and they need to talk, I might call them at 730 in the morning, if I know that person likes to talk early. So I would say that I get a lot of work done pretty early via email. I will often send emails to my team members saying, let's make sure to do this, let's make sure to do that. A lot of the thoughts I have that I put down in, you know, in an email in the morning, I have thought about before I went to bed, I'll be honest. Sometimes before I've gotten out of bed, most mornings for me start out with a workout. That's like really important part of my day. I've been doing that since probably senior year of college. It puts order into my day, gives me energy. I think I have a lot of like nervous energy and some anxiety like a lot of people do. And that is the best thing for me to release that anxiety to make me feel better and clear headed. So that would be what I would say, the two things that the three things that are sort of happen every day is drinking coffee, checking email, organizing my day and working out. The rest can go in many different directions. The rest of the day, and one of the things I love about my job is that no days look exactly alike. Like today, I've actually been in the office a lot, which is great because it's 100 degrees here in New York. So I haven't minded at all. But I didn't have that many appointments because people cancel because of the heat. So I've been doing a lot of catching up on things that I had to do, bored that I'm on, just checking things that I sometimes don't have a chance to check at the office. But my day consists of speaking to clients, both buyers and sellers, checking new listings, checking my listings to make sure that they're looking the best, thinking of ideas of how I can repackage them, remark at them, thinking about marking ideas. And thinking about different kinds of outreach. And then also I read the paper every day. It's not always first thing in the morning, but I do read the paper every day. Nowadays, we all get a lot of news within our email. If it's something that I enjoy reading or I find relevant, I'll read those emails, other ones I delete. I try to stay really focused on work and task the hand during the day. I think people of my generation, I'm 60 years old, are probably a little bit better at that than some of the younger generation. You know, I'm just never on Instagram or Facebook during the day. It's not my habit, it's not my interest. To me, I would find it disruptive. The people who work for me mainly are under 30 or 31. And I have one person who is older than 40 and one person who's my age. They're not, I don't find that they have that issue, but the younger people I often will see are on social media during the day. And I actually did a test for them like a challenge a few months ago. I said to anybody who can stay off of social media for five days in a row gets a $1,500 bonus at the end of the five days. But if you make it two days and then you go on, oh, this is between nine and five. If you break it, the five days starts again. And the feedback was amazing. I mean, one of my teammates said to me, I actually was less depressed. I felt better when I was on during the day. So I think they learned something about themselves. So I think that that's probably a little bit of advice that I'll throw out there to people. You know, we're all multitask. That's the way the world is. But the fact is, is we can't multitask that well. Absolutely. The data is clear. We can't really multitask at all, right? Very few of us are able to be effective in that way. And to talk about social media for a second, because we don't really talk about it all that much on our show other than how to be successful using social media. But when we talk about being successful, we're talking about how to actually interact with your sphere on social media. And if you're doing that and you're you're really trying to deepen relationships, great. That's a good use of your time in social media. But if you're going there to consume, consume content, Lisa's, you know, really talking about then, you know, how useful is that? And yeah, I am so grateful. I'm sure you are as well that you and I did not grow up with social media. So we don't really have those habits. And I really feel for the younger people who grew up with it because how could you not be addicted to it if you've been on it, you know, since you were 10 years old or even younger, it's of course people are addicted. And I think that's a great point. So, you know, and you're right too. The other thing I find when I do go on social media, which is very rare is I don't feel as good about myself. I look at things I don't have. I look at people on vacations that I'm not at. I look at people further along in life, at least according to the picture I'm seeing. Maybe they're not actually, but it looks like they're further along. And I feel less than. And I can't, I don't know how anybody doesn't feel that way. They're at dinners. I'm not at it. And it really does. It's hard to maintain my own sense of like, I'm doing great. When I see everybody posting their best selves over and over and over. Nobody's posting, you know, the arguments and the fights and the mistakes and the failures. And of course, those, that's really more of what, of what, you know, normal life is like anyway. So yeah, I'm with you on that. I think if you find yourself consuming social media daily and you don't find that it's helpful, you know, if it's a few minutes here and there, fine, but if it's taking away time from things that you want to do, then try to stretch a bit and feel the anxiety that maybe you would feel that you social media would sort of soothe you from and learn how to cope with that anxiety or maybe go workout. I do the same thing. I work out not every day, but I work out three days a week. And I didn't realize how nervous, how much nervous energy I had like you were saying before I started exercising. And I don't like to exercise. It's not something I would choose to do, but it is a really good idea for me. And as much as I hate to do pushups and pullups and wall sits and all the awful things you have to do in the gym, it's a really good idea. And so I try to do things that are good ideas. And so Lisa, thank you for all of that. I want to ask you a little bit about sort of process. And so a couple of things that I think is always interesting. So a lot of times agents who aren't playing in the luxury space yet think, well, if I just had that $10 million listing, boy, all my problems would be solved. It's kind of like if I just won the lottery, all my problems would be solved. It's like, I don't know. I don't know that's true because there's a whole host of challenges that come with listing luxury properties. Number one, not that many people are walking around that can afford to buy a $10,000 property. So if you're representing the seller, you might get lucky and someone sees it and then just buys. But a lot of times you have to go out and source the buyers yourself or you have to network with those other agents who play in that space as well. So it's really brings on a different type of challenge. So can you speak a little bit to that? That how is luxury different from the non-luxury market? Well, it's a little bit hard to describe. And I think that because I came to this, sort of organically and slowly, you know, so I started in this business when I was 34 and 34, 33. And now I'm 60. I'd sort of have this natural progression where I started with smaller listings and I've gotten to larger listings. So now I'm sort of like the old woman in the office with all of the knowledge and all of this experience and it feels comfortable for me. But I will say that every time I sort of jumped and got that next bigger listing, it was, it felt, it was, I was nervous, you know, it felt like a challenge. And I think what you have to do is you have to lean into it. You have to lean into the fact that it's a new challenge for you. And you really have to study how you're going to market or deal with somebody who's at a higher praise point and make sure that you know all of the competition that's at that praise point, whether you're working with a buyer at that praise point or a seller, make sure you know what else is out there. That's super important. And you want to make sure that everything you're doing is appropriate for that property. Now some of these things I'm going to mention seem really stupid. But if you're showing a $10 million property in a fancy neighborhood, I don't think you should show up in your gym clothes. Now I don't think you should show up in your gym clothes to show anything, but that's probably the 60 year old lawyer in the speaking. But I do think that there's a level of sophistication that comes with a different praise point. So for instance, in my office, I have a role that the guys should wear, you know, um, work shirts. And if we have an important meeting, they should wear a jacket. We've given up on the ties. Um, well, you know, no jeans, no shorts. Um, and that's because we're working at a certain level that I think that that's super important. Um, I also have rules like no being on your phone while you're showing a property. Now, should you not do that when you're showing a half a million dollar studio apartment, you shouldn't, but certainly not if you're showing a $10 million property. Um, and I think that all those things make a big difference. And I'll just tell you briefly that I took over the last five listings, um, and a new building on the Upper East Side from a different agency. And, um, I sold the three largest ones with a contract out on the fourth, largest one, um, within two months. And they hadn't been able to sell them in a really, really long time. Um, one of the reasons why is that I think that I was able to work with the buyer pool better because I understood the buyer pool. These were all over $11 million. And, um, we presented our marketing and our salesmanship in a very high and sophisticated way. Yeah. But, you know, that's come with hard work. Yeah, you know, I like that you spoke about sort of the aesthetic piece because of course, knowledge, experience, presentation, um, all of that is so important. But you do also have to consider how you appear physically, right? And so you're talking about showing up well dressed, um, showing up in a professional manner. Attorneys are kind of the last group that is still holding on to the suits. And I kind of like it. Um, and in fact, my, my girlfriend has a fantasy that in the future that in courts, they can all wear robes. So they would be all equal that she's like, that'll probably never happen. But, um, but, you know, she has to wear the fancy business suits as well. But it is, uh, it is something that I always think I always kind of look at things in life. I don't know if you feel the same way. This, what's the downside? Right. So I look at things like, um, you know, I go, well, if I go to the gym, what's the downside? Well, a little bit of time, I'm not going to want to do it. It hurts. It's like super uncomfortable. It's painful. But that's it. That's really it. And then there's like a million upsides. If I, if I volunteer somewhere, what's the downside? A little bit of time. And I get all these, you know, benefits. If I follow up with my clients, if I dress well, if I pay attention to, you know, somebody during a listing instead of being on my phone, what's the downside? Maybe I miss out on a couple of Instagram posts, right? Who cares? And so I love that, that you sort of are intentional about the way you present yourself because it is really important. You know, I don't want to go out with a professional who's, uh, distracted. I want to go out with a professional that looks professional. And again, you know, nobody really wants to put on suits and ties. And we don't want to do that. But, you know, oh, well, you know, it's going to most likely project an image that is, of course, you know, something that people will think, wow, this person at least takes their job seriously. And so I agree that, of course, you have to be really good at your job too. But, you know, making sure that the whole package is really well presented is, uh, is so important. I have a question about communication. So I am always curious when, you know, whether it's a luxury client or not, I'm sure you treat all your clients the same. Of course you do. How often are you communicating? Let's talk about listings. So you have sellers and, you know, whether the home is, you know, having eyeballs on it or people walking in and checking it out or not, how often are you communicating with these sellers to sort of give them updates? Do you have a process for that? Do you sort of do it on intuition or how does that work? It's a combination of both. So I do have a process. I try to send reports to all of my sellers every two to three weeks maximum. And that's a formal report that goes through how many times we've shown the property, how many times we've had repeat viewings, all the advertising that we've done. And then, um, click through links showing where their apartment or property is featured so that they have it all in front of them. Um, then I also try to, you know, depending on the person, I try to give feedback after I show their property. If it's a property you're showing a ton. Sometimes that's hard to do. But I do try, especially, you know, nowadays it takes two seconds to write a text or an email to somebody. I really do try to give feedback after I've shown the property. Even if it's just two lines, that was a good showing or that showing didn't seem that problem is saying or whatever. You know, sometimes you don't always have feedback right away. Um, and I'm sure that I have clients who feel that I'm not in touch with them as much. Um, I'm sure that I have clients who feel that I'm in touch with them plenty. Um, I, but I, I do try to communicate as much as possible. And like I said, it's, it's somewhat organic. It's somewhat sort of just based on the situation. There is a process that we have also, um, and I do think being in communication with your clients is incredibly important. Yeah. I also want to switch over to buyers for a second because right now, you know, rates are certainly higher than anyone would really prefer. They're not traditionally, uh, all that high, but certainly as compared to the three person that days of, of before and, oh boy, you know, it's funny. It was such a great thing for all of us that owned or bought during that time. But then it's also this, this sort of, um, you know, we're like handcuffed now to our properties. And, you know, it's not, it's not the most, um, painless experience to go from 3% to seven, seven percent, uh, these days, I'm going to have to make that, uh, just, I'm going to have to do that myself here, uh, in the next year. And it's going to, I'll be fine. But it's certainly, I understand why a lot of people are sitting on the sidelines. But when we talk about buyers, I just want to talk about one thing in particular because I always find that really successful agents do this a little differently than others. And I'm sure you see as a person who has a lot of listings, you probably see the full gamut of experience. I'm talking about presenting offers. So offers are typically sent via email. Um, you know, they're, they're, the email that sent. There is an attachment that's usually sent there. There's maybe text in the email, maybe not. And maybe there's a phone call that follows up with it. Maybe there's a text that follows up with it. Maybe not. Um, I just want to hear from you is what do you think are best practices when submitting an offer, whether it's a competitive environment or not? I always like to call the other agent and tell them I'm going to be submitting an offer. And then when I submit an offer, I do it by email. I see, see myself. I put in the first line, the subject line offer on the property so that they see it. You know, it's, it's visible in their inbox right away. Um, in New York, again, we have a lot of co-ops. So the people's financials are important. Um, but even if it's not a co-op, I think it's important to attach a financial statement or some financial information about the buyer. And then in the body of the offer, I like to put a little bit of information about the people, you know, what they do, how, where they live, if they have kids, if they have a dog, if they've owned before, um, those kinds of things. And, um, and then I usually follow up to make sure that they've gotten the offer. So I think, you know, presentation, communication is super important. And remember that a desperate seller will kind of hang on to any offer they get. But a seller who has, you know, a few different offers, you can really distinguish yourself by making the offer seem more serious and more viable, even if it's not the top offer. I mean, I will tell you that I'm now marketing a property for two million dollars and we have three different offers. And they were all around the same price. But one of them came in and just was much more professionally, um, presented than the others. And that was. So will you create like a, a, a title page or a page that sort of lists the bullet points, um, before you actually get into the meat of the contract, like here are the main points or it sounds like you sort of do a version of that in the offer. I do it. I mean, I don't do it with bullet points, but I usually, I have sort of a format in my head, you know, thank you for showing it to us. Appreciate your time. That's the first paragraph on behalf of my client. Please to present this offer. It's cash. It's contingent on financing. It's not contingent on financing. I give them some information about them. I follow and then next paragraph will be a little bit more information. And then I also will always say, you know, a next to this email is their pre-approved all their financial statement, whatever else you need as backup. Yeah. I love that. And I again, to you, this is like, of course, you should do it exactly this way. I imagine you see, and again, maybe in the luxury space, you see less of this, but certainly in the non-luxury space, you will see all sorts of offers coming in, sort of, you know, haggard offers, you know, hastily written, maybe no, you know, no sort of data points put in there, maybe nothing in the email at all other than the actual, you know, PDF that's in there. And, you know, it is amazing. I'm curious, how often, when you have a listing, does the agent present the offer via email, you know, follows it up with a phone call or starts with a phone call, sends a text, makes, you know, how often do you receive things in a way that you think that's a really, well, you just talked about the listing that you have now, that three of them, you said, one of them really looked good. How often do you receive them in a way where you're like that, that person did a good job? I would say that 85% of the time I do. I think that has to do with the fact that we have so many co-ops and that I'm also playing in a pretty high, high end of the market. So most of the brokers have some experience. But, you know, as you mentioned earlier on, the barrier to entry is very low in this job. And that doesn't mean that you have to have like, that you're necessarily better at this if you have a large degree than if you don't. But we're dealing with a lot of opportunities in New York City, whatever property, price point you're at, half a million, 15 million, right? It's all expensive. And it's a lot of money to whomever is working with you. So if you want to do well, whether you have a college degree or not, educate yourself in what you're doing so that you present yourself in a very sophisticated and knowledgeable way. Because some of the most successful brokers I know are not people that have business degrees from Harvard. Sure. And some of the least successful brokers are ones that do have business degrees from HBS. And I think to myself, oh my god, like what happened? So, you know, you can make yourself into a successful person by training yourself and learning your craft. Yeah, I don't obviously agree that is really great advice. I want to talk about in between sales. So you have the transaction. You do a great job. It closes. Everyone's happy. And now it's a seven year window before maybe the next transaction. What are you doing in those seven years to stay at least in touch with those clients? Like what does that look like? Well, so I always send a gift to somebody after they close. I try to think of something that they will enjoy lately. I've been doing a lot of like donations in someone's honor because I feel like a lot of my wealthy clients sort of have everything they need and find them a gift that they have to put on a shelf or a wine that they don't drink is like not necessary. So I'll find out like a charity that they're involved in. Then I send a Christmas card every year, a holiday card, I should say. For years I did the Zagat Restaurant Guide and then they stopped printing them and people stopped carrying around books. Anyway, everything was online. So now I get a holiday card from a charity. I've done share our strengths. No kid left behind like hungry children. I've done habitat for humanity. And it's a card, a holiday card that says that a donation has been made in the person's honor. And my list grows every year. I mean, have probably a thousand people on my list at this point. I spend you know, $10,000 to charity. But people appreciate it. People really appreciate it. I often get notes back, you know, thanks for the donation in my honor. And I think it means something to people. You know, I'm going to pause right there because you were the first person in 700 episodes to ever share that specific type of holiday card. So we all send holiday cards or a lot of us do. And you know, some of them are handwritten. Some of them aren't. And you know, holiday cards are kind of like, yeah, it's okay. It's great. But you know, a lot of people do it. But you're doing something a little different and something that is more impactful. And something that really touches people, which is I'm putting money back into this organization that I think is important. I'm doing kind of think, have I ever received a card where somebody made a donation? I mean, you'll see this sometimes when people passed away, though, the donations made in someone's honor to a particular type of organization that supports, you know, some sort of disease or condition. But you don't typically see it outside of that. And so I love that you do that. It's sort of, I think our audience could could blitz pass that without realizing the significance. Everybody wants to feel like they can contribute. And a lot of people are so busy and they don't do as much volunteer work or they don't donate as much as they probably would like to. And so any little thing like that that gets them a little closer to that experience is certainly going to have a positive effect. And I know you're not doing it to get business. You're doing it because it's the right thing to do. And you feel that it's important to you. And it's also something that really differentiates you from all the other agents who send, you know, a handwritten card, which is good. That's great too. And you're, I guess you're doing a version of that as well. But the donation I think is a really nice touch. And certainly is you going above and beyond to say, hey, I'm doing this, you know, after the sale with you and we're still a team basically. Right. Well, you know, this, the CEO of our company is a woman named Best Friedman. And one of the things that she always talks about is that this is a people business, right. And she's somebody who's very conscious of, you know, needy people and the world that we live in. And I grew up in a family where giving back was very important. And so if you look at my Instagram too, like I definitely show some of my properties. I don't brag about where I go on vacation. Once in a while, I may show a picture of me and my kids saying, you know, this was a fun Christmas to be with my kids. I'm so happy, you know, but that's kind of like a rare few and far between. I try to put messages in my Instagram post, you know, I might show pretty nature and mention, you know, save the planet, appreciate the nature, appreciate your neighbor. It's all sort of the same concept. Like all of us, the way all of us live, everybody listening to this, we're all lucky, right. We all have a decent place to live. We're all getting to enjoy a job in a free world, a free country. We can complain about a lot of things. We're all really lucky. And I don't take any of that from granted. So I feel like we all need to give back because if everybody gave back, we could make the world a better place. And that's just something I really stick to. And I really believe in and going back to this being a people person, like, you know, I like to work with people who understand that and hopefully people like to work with me because that's important to me. So it goes back to being true to who you are, right. I mean, you know, I'm giving advice on working hard and being professional and being present and being respectful, but be who you are. You know, don't be afraid to be who you are. Yep. And you know, this idea of again, what's the downside? So you should, if you're not currently contributing in a way that's meaningful to you with an organization, you know, really consider doing that. What are you passionate about? And start thinking about how you can volunteer time or money with those organizations because number one, it's going to make you feel better. And it's a nice thing to do outside of the grind of this job. Also, it's going to, you know, certainly not going to look unfavorable to your clients, not that you would be bragging about, I'd do this volunteer work, but to let people know that you support certain organizations, that is a very powerful thing because people respond very favorably, of course, to people that contribute. And so it's again, it's what's the downside a little bit of time, a little bit of money, but you get to feel great, regardless, and people respond well, and you know, you're doing good in the world. So I'm a huge, huge fan of that. I wish I would have learned that lesson sooner in life. I've been, you know, contributing probably for about 20 plus years, but I wish I would have started in my early 20s. I was a little maybe more self-absorbed at that time and didn't realize how much I could give, but it really is a great suggestion. And I appreciate you sharing that with us. And I want to talk, it also too, I like that you are not posting on social media about all of your major, you know, sort of personal successes. Like here, here I am on this wonderful vacation, because at the end of the day, you know, I mean, maybe friends and family kind of would like to see, you know, pictures of you, and you can send those to people privately, of course. But I always do get a little, I don't want to, you know, I was just in Seattle with my girlfriend for the weekend. We were just there just to sort of enjoy Seattle. And we were there last weekend. And I was thinking of posting and then I go, if I post a bunch of pictures of us doing Seattle stuff, that's cute and whatever it's fine. But am I really just kind of showing off a little bit like, look at me, I was in Seattle. And like, what is my intention here? Like, I already sent them to my friends and family privately. And do I need the world to know that I want to see out of like, who cares? And so I sort of am with you there as I don't, I think we tend to want to, you know, I guess the point is, think about what's the intention, right? What's the intention of this post? Is it to boost my ego? Is it to get people to think I'm this really amazing, cool thing? Or is it in a way that's, you know, contributing to something? And I think, yeah, the world would be a lot better if we thought about how do we contribute versus how do we impress? So I appreciate you doing that. Lisa, I want to finish with just a piece of advice. So you work with a lot of agents, you've seen agents come and go, you've seen agents succeed, others not succeed. And a lot of agents right now are struggling because markets not in its, you know, most perfect state, of course. And, you know, agents are suffering right now. So for anyone out there that's just needs a little boost. What would you suggest that they should do if they don't, if they aren't flush with clients right now? So a few years ago, the guy who manages my office, who's been my manager for many years and he's now actually a co-president of the company, Kevin Koveski, said to me that there was a friend of mine who was working here and she had complained to him that she wasn't busy enough. And so he said to her, how many doors do you walk through a week? And it was a, it was a soft period. It might have been like after the financial crisis, you know? And she said, I don't know, I don't know what you mean. And he said, how many doors do you walk through? And he said, for instance, I bet if I would look at Lisa's week, she probably walks through 50 doors a week. And so that's my advice. All of us have gone through slower times. So what do you do? Don't sit at home waiting for the phone to ring. Just like when you were a teenager or in college, your mother told you not to sit at home and wait for the boy to call you, the girl to call you, right? Go out with your friends, do something, be busy, right? That's not, that's not going to make the phone ring. And it's the same thing. If you sit at your desk, the phones aren't going to ring quicker. Go walk through doors, go to open houses, preview properties that are being shown, walk through doors because you never know when you're going to be sitting next to somebody on the subway in a restaurant, in a sauna, wherever. And somebody says, oh, yeah, I've been looking, oh, you're a broker. I've been looking for a two-bedroom and I really want to have a swimming pool. And if you may be able to say, oh, my God, that's so interesting. Yesterday I went and saw this great apartment in a building that has a swimming pool. And I have gotten business that way because I put myself out there looking at things and you know, life is all about opportunities, right? The more opportunities we make for ourselves, the more they come together, the more people you know, the more people you meet, the more people you know, the more stories you know. So you have to put yourself out there, go through doors, walk through doors. If you're a new agent, ask a busy broker in your office if you can help in an open house. Yes. You know, be the greeter in a brownstone where there's no dormant in New York. You know, we have lots of dormant members. We also have buildings that where you have to like be there when somebody needs to go up to the to the walk-up or put yourself out there. That is how you are going to make opportunities for yourself. They don't just come and fall on our laps. We have to keep looking for them. Yeah, I wish they would fall at my lap, but they just hasn't happened for me yet. I don't want yours.
