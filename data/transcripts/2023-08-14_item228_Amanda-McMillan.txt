[00:01:33] Hello and welcome to another episode of Keeping It Real, the largest podcast made by Real
[00:01:39] Estate Agents and four real estate agents.
[00:01:41] My name is DJ Paris.
[00:01:43] I'm your guide.
[00:01:43] I'm your host.
[00:01:44] And I have a few quick announcements.
[00:01:48] We're going to be speaking just a few moments with Amanda Mcmillan, a top top top producer.
[00:01:54] But before we get to Amanda, just a couple of ways you can help us and help the show.
[00:02:00] Best way is to things.
[00:02:01] Two things.
[00:02:03] First, is to tell a friend, think of another agent that doesn't yet know about our show.
[00:02:08] Probably somebody in your office or another agent you meet out there who would like to
[00:02:12] learn from top 1% producers.
[00:02:14] Tell them about the show.
[00:02:15] The second way, check out our sponsors.
[00:02:19] They are the reason we can keep paying our bills and producing episodes.
[00:02:22] We love our sponsors and their services and products.
[00:02:25] They provide our truly amazing.
[00:02:27] We vet them thoroughly to make sure that we only present you with services and products
[00:02:32] that will actually help you build your business.
[00:02:35] Okay, guys, help us out those two ways.
[00:02:37] Thank you in advance.
[00:02:38] And let's get to the main event.
[00:02:40] It's my conversation with Amanda Mcmillan.
[00:02:55] Okay, today on the show, we have Amanda Mcmillan from Chicago Home Partner here in Chicago
[00:03:00] with at properties, Christie's International Real Estate.
[00:03:04] Let me tell you more about Amanda.
[00:03:05] Amanda Mcmillan is the CEO of Chicago Home Partner, which is an intimate group consistently
[00:03:10] ranking in the top 50 city agents for both number of transactions and volume.
[00:03:15] I'm going to pause in reading Amanda's bio here because there's 46,000 real estate agents
[00:03:22] in the Chicago Ed area.
[00:03:23] This is a very, very big, amazing statistic that she is in the top 50.
[00:03:28] They have been the number one team in the at properties, Bucktown location, which is also
[00:03:32] one of the very top buck at properties locations for the last eight years and is close over 58
[00:03:38] million in 2022.
[00:03:41] Now over the past two decades, Amanda has operated one of the most profitable real estate teams
[00:03:45] in Chicago, accumulating hundreds of outstanding reviews from raving fans across Google, Zillow,
[00:03:52] LinkedIn, and Yelp successfully navigating two financial crises, crises, one worldwide
[00:03:58] pandemic, the birth of two children hosting a bio anti-hosa biweekly podcast at ChicagoRealTalk.com
[00:04:05] while remaining a social introvert at heart and maintaining a 95% referral based business.
[00:04:12] I would like everyone to visit ChicagoRealTalk.com and it's going to redirect you to Amanda's YouTube
[00:04:20] page.
[00:04:21] I'm going to encourage you, even if you're not a Chicago REALTOR, most of you listening are not.
[00:04:25] The reason I want you to subscribe is I want you to pay special attention to hear how Amanda
[00:04:31] talks about the real estate market, how she informs her clients. Her videos are amazing and she is
[00:04:37] just a wizard at this. So please go subscribe, ChicagoRealTalk.com. We will have a link to that in our
[00:04:44] show notes. Amanda, welcome to the show. Thanks so much for having me. It's great to be here.
[00:04:50] I'm excited to have you. Actually, Amanda works very close to where I live. So we were just
[00:04:55] chatting about our sort of similar neighborhoods. But I am, I've not met you before. So I'm so excited.
[00:05:02] Usually I talk to people who live like far distances and you are actually about as close of a distance,
[00:05:08] but yet we haven't met. So I'm super excited to have you on the show. And I think because you
[00:05:13] describe yourself as an introvert, you know, you're not, you don't make your presence quite as known
[00:05:20] as some of the other agents here locally, which I actually respect a lot because I think that is
[00:05:27] the inclination of agents is to, you know, sort of yell it from the mountaintops how great they
[00:05:32] we are. And I feel like you just, you show, don't tell, which I think is even more impressive.
[00:05:38] So I just wanted to honor you for being, you know, less in your face, I think, which I always
[00:05:45] respect agents that are a little bit more subtle. And you certainly fall into that category. And I hope
[00:05:49] I hope that comes off as a compliment because it's like the best compliment I could think. I don't
[00:05:53] know that I said it in the best possible way, but it is, it is a compliment.
[00:05:57] No, absolutely. It's been, it's been a heck of a ride. And yes, I, I will now say 21 years later,
[00:06:03] I tell people that I'm an extroverted introvert because I've had 21 years in this business in which
[00:06:07] I've had to train myself to be a little bit more extroverted. But, but I absolutely will be the
[00:06:12] person to say that the personality type that the media really shows out there doesn't necessarily
[00:06:18] always go hand in hand with a top producer. Absolutely. And I would love to, you know, I think to,
[00:06:25] you know, ever since the pandemic started and this is not in any positive thing about the pandemic.
[00:06:30] But one thing that did change is I think introverts in particular, people got used to working more
[00:06:38] remote, you know, doing Zoom meetings. And I think for introverts, that probably was like so
[00:06:42] wonderful because it allowed introverts to be in their sort of native environment where they're
[00:06:47] most comfortable. Their energy is not being depleted as much as, and so I just think like never
[00:06:53] been a better time to be an introverted REALTOR. And the fact that introverts are kind of people
[00:06:58] are learning more about that and learning more about what they need and how they process information
[00:07:02] differently. So I think that is, is super cool. I always, there's so many times where I've talked to
[00:07:07] people wanting to become REALTORS and they go, well, I'm introverted. I don't know if it's a good fit.
[00:07:11] I'm like, oh, no, it's, it's a good fit. You just have to learn how to do things, you know, maybe
[00:07:15] differently than somebody who's, you know, really out there and, and, and, you know, being, being super,
[00:07:20] super social. Not that you're not, of course, I'm sure you are. I always, I've always actually said,
[00:07:25] I think most consumers on the outside would be surprised to learn how many top producers are
[00:07:30] actually more introverted in their personality style than the other. I, I, I agree. That, that's
[00:07:37] almost been not every, I would say more than half of the top producers that I've interviewed, I
[00:07:43] suspect would identify that way. We were talking about Carrie McCormick, somebody who works at your
[00:07:48] firm who comes on our show a lot. She definitely considers herself that way as well. So I, I think
[00:07:53] there is something to it. That is, again, very exciting for, for anybody listening who might think,
[00:07:58] gosh, I'm not quite, I don't get as much juice out of, you know, being extroverted as I do introverted.
[00:08:03] So, but I want to start at the very, very beginning of, of how you got into real estate, why real estate.
[00:08:09] And can you walk us through that journey? Absolutely. It's been a heck of a journey. That's a great
[00:08:14] word for it. I am first and foremost a third generation REALTOR. So I was born into it. It was in my
[00:08:22] blood. I will tell most people my first experiences with it was when I was working my mom's open
[00:08:28] houses in broker opens when I was a teenager, she would essentially pay me $50, which was a
[00:08:33] tremendous amount of money. Good money. You can't answer any questions. You sit there and if
[00:08:39] anybody says anything, you give them my card. So I wasn't doing anything unethical or wrong or
[00:08:44] anything like that. But that was my introduction. As I moved into my young adult years, I absolutely
[00:08:50] will say that I think the backing behind why I ended up in this industry is because when we were
[00:08:56] around the dinner table and we were talking about life aspirations, my parents would continually say
[00:09:01] to myself and my sister, they said, girls, when you grow up, you can be anything you want. You want
[00:09:06] to be a movie star, you want to be president, you want to be a doctor, you can be anything you want.
[00:09:10] What do you want to be side note? You can't go into real estate. Now the reason they said that
[00:09:17] is that my mother's sold residential real estate for 30 plus years. My father was in commercial
[00:09:22] real estate for almost as long. You know, as I like to tell people, it's not that they didn't think
[00:09:26] it was a wonderful industry. It's just that at that time when I was growing up in the 80s,
[00:09:32] it just looked at as a different type of industry and it wasn't necessarily where you wanted to end
[00:09:38] up. It's kind of what you fell into a little bit more. And with that being said, they told me that
[00:09:43] at a very, very young age now anybody that knows me and knows me well says that I probably hid that
[00:09:47] in the back of my psyche that somebody told me not to do something so that when the time came to be,
[00:09:53] I said, wait a second. You told me I shouldn't do that. I'm going to do it and I'm going to show
[00:09:57] you how I knock it out of the park when I do it. So long story short, it was in my blood. I was kind
[00:10:02] of told to stay away from it and therefore I ran at it full force. I love that you rebelled by going,
[00:10:08] I'm going to do exactly what you did mom and dad and maybe grandpa grandpa grandma. No, no, but I
[00:10:14] I love that and it makes perfect sense because obviously you you just were exposed to it. It's such a
[00:10:21] young age you you didn't have the same experience of somebody graduating college going, gosh,
[00:10:27] what do I do now? And then maybe like you said, maybe falling into real estate when, you know,
[00:10:32] maybe they went to school for marketing or some other purpose and maybe didn't, you know, couldn't
[00:10:36] find a foothold in that career. And then some of the people fall back on real estate. But I love the
[00:10:41] fact that it was clearly in your in your genes and and you didn't ignore that even though your
[00:10:46] parents were like, we want we want you to do other things. Well, I didn't say there's one
[00:10:51] little interesting tidbit to it because there was a side venture before I before I decided to come
[00:10:56] back to one one of my degrees actually I had a double major in college and one of my degrees is
[00:11:00] actually in a question in studies for those that don't know that is the study of horses. I actually
[00:11:06] rode professionally. Horses have always been a part of my life. They still are to this day. I
[00:11:10] rode professionally out of college and I did that thing where I followed one of my absolute passions
[00:11:15] and it's one of those things that when you follow one of your absolute passions into life and into
[00:11:19] profession, sometimes it loses some of the passion and you realize that maybe it wasn't the right
[00:11:23] idea. Yeah. So I did have an interesting side endeavor, but it was pretty quick. I actually got
[00:11:29] back into the real estate world by the time I was 24. Are you are you still riding today? I am for
[00:11:35] better for worse. Sometimes people say I'm a little nuts and a little crazy. I do still ride and
[00:11:39] I still ride and I'm pretty competitive level. And then do you ride? Okay, I'm going to ask you the one
[00:11:44] question I know about equestrian, which is do you ride dressage or that's the only thing I know,
[00:11:49] right? Is that the right word? That is the right word. Very good. Dressage is the flatwork,
[00:11:53] a little bit artistry, a little bit like dancing. That's not what I do. I do jumping. So I like
[00:11:57] big jumps and I like to jump in the fastest I can. Amazing. And where do you so do you live in the
[00:12:02] city? I know your offices here. Are you out? No, just out of curiosity because now I'm fascinated
[00:12:05] about where the horse is. So I'm our primary residence is in the city. Our horses live out
[00:12:11] near Libertyville. So they're not far from the city. We do have a farm as well in northwest Illinois.
[00:12:17] That's the I always joke and say that I love the city. I love everything about it, but I'm not
[00:12:23] always a city person so that we have a little bit of an ability to get a 24 hour escape when we need to.
[00:12:28] I will tell you I did. I went to Miraval, which is this sort of new AG fancy place in Tucson with
[00:12:38] my mom years ago to kind of where like wealthy people go to chill out and relax and find themselves.
[00:12:43] But but I my mom won this trip there and so we went and we got to to to really spend time with
[00:12:50] with horses and and learn learn about how to clean them and groom them. And it was part of a
[00:12:56] therapeutic process of getting in connection and and it was actually quite relaxing and peaceful.
[00:13:02] And yeah, so that that's also my I didn't mean to get caught up on on on your equestrian stuff,
[00:13:07] but it's very cool, especially for people who live in the city. Super cool. So so you you got into
[00:13:13] real estate, you know, your parents said no, you said yes. And then what what you know, you've seen
[00:13:20] gosh hundreds if not thousands of agents come and go. I'm sure in that time frame, what do you
[00:13:26] think made the difference for you in terms of success? Like you've seen people make it you've seen
[00:13:31] people who don't make it. What do you think was were some of the reasons why you did better?
[00:13:37] And obviously having, you know, family into where you probably were more more attuned to it.
[00:13:41] But what do you think made the difference for you? I wish I could say that there was some sort of
[00:13:46] special pill or some some magic thing that I did. The reality is is I worked my ass off. I mean,
[00:13:53] there's no Katie coding that is that, you know, it's funny. I try I talked to it and I mentor a
[00:13:58] lot of younger agents and stuff like that. And the reality is the first market I ever stepped into
[00:14:04] was just post September 11th. I joined the industry in 2002. So that was that was my introduction.
[00:14:13] Now I didn't know any difference. So it was fine. But the reality is that I entered the market
[00:14:17] at a time of complete crisis. Now in hindsight, 21 years later and three crisis later, I think that
[00:14:24] that probably shaped a lot of the way that I work with my clients. But I came in from the start and
[00:14:29] I am always one of those believers that we are in charge of our own destiny, so to say. And that
[00:14:35] if I want to succeed in something, I know the odds are stacked against me. What am I going to do?
[00:14:41] I'm going to work incredibly hard to get there. Now, I think the hardest part for a newer agent is
[00:14:46] you don't always know what to work harder on. You know, I think that that's one of the question marks
[00:14:50] okay, sure, I can show up and say I'm going to work hard. But a lot of times it's the question is
[00:14:54] the what where, why, how, when. So for me, when I first got into the industry, I knew I needed one
[00:15:00] thing. I needed training, right? That is all I needed. This was not an era in which there were
[00:15:06] teams or anything like that. Somebody that would take me under their wing. So I at the time looked
[00:15:10] for the company that I didn't know if I'd stay with them long term, but I looked for the company
[00:15:14] that in my opinion had the absolute best training possible. And I joined them because I knew 1,000
[00:15:20] percent at that point in time I needed that. So if somebody was going to give me the training and
[00:15:23] then somebody was going to put it back on me to execute all of those pieces, well, then I was
[00:15:28] at least setting myself up for better success. It's actually really a really rational and sort of
[00:15:34] logical approach that I think a lot of newer agents don't know how critical the training. Well,
[00:15:41] it's tough. I think about this a lot because you get your you pass the exam, you get your license,
[00:15:46] you join a firm and every firm's calling you at the same time. So you're getting all of these,
[00:15:51] at least here in Illinois, they everyone's data gets sold, every brokerage. So we're all calling
[00:15:56] at the same time going, please join our firm. And everybody says they have great training. That's
[00:16:00] the other thing too is then trying to figure out which firms actually do a good job of that, not
[00:16:05] all firms do at properties where you are is absolutely known for having exceptional training. It always
[00:16:11] has ever since I've been in this industry. So you certainly, you know, you certainly at a good firm.
[00:16:17] And I don't know if you started there, but you're at a firm now that absolutely is well known for
[00:16:22] that. So, you know, is that something that you recommend when you talk to newer agents is like,
[00:16:26] hey, if when you're choosing a firm, you know, think about what the training options are and how,
[00:16:32] just out of curiosity, how might you, if you were new today, how might you start to figure out
[00:16:37] which firms do a better job of that than others is, do you, would you have any suggestions for agents
[00:16:41] that maybe this year are thinking maybe I should switch firms or look at other options, you know,
[00:16:46] because everyone does say I have good training. Right. No, absolutely, absolutely. I think it takes
[00:16:51] definitely a lot of due diligence upfront because the reality is, as you said, if when you get your
[00:16:56] license, anybody's going to give you a shot, right? The reality is it's, it's not a leap. You can
[00:17:01] work anywhere. Special. Anybody will hire you. So the fact that someone's calling you and so
[00:17:06] it's calling you, they feel great, but it really doesn't mean much. In terms of finding out the
[00:17:11] training, obviously you want to sit down, you know, with the managing brokers, you want to hear what
[00:17:15] they have to say, but the reality is, is most managing brokers are accomplished agents that at some
[00:17:20] point in time decided to take a step back and doing it another way. So that's a salesperson that's
[00:17:24] trying to sell you on the training and they should probably be pretty good, especially if they got
[00:17:29] put into that role to help coach agents in that capacity. So that's a good starting point because
[00:17:34] I think there's certain companies that, A, just when you go in and you meet with people,
[00:17:38] I think you're going to connect on certain levels and you're not going to feel right. So first and
[00:17:42] for most, trust your gut. Trust what you feel in that connection. Did you, did you feel appropriate
[00:17:47] sitting down? Did it feel like the office and everything like that had what you were looking for?
[00:17:51] Or did it feel off in any way? The next thing I would do is I would absolutely ask to talk to
[00:17:56] a couple of agents in that office. If you don't know any yourself, ask the managing brokers,
[00:18:00] say, hey, I'd love to talk to an agent. I'd like to talk to somebody very, very experienced.
[00:18:04] And I'd like to talk to somebody that maybe has been newer in your program in the last six to 12
[00:18:08] months because then you can ask them what they have gone through and how it has come to be from
[00:18:14] that perspective. So I think that doing a little bit more due diligence, don't be afraid to ask.
[00:18:19] I think a lot of people when they join this industry, especially if they are younger and it's a
[00:18:24] first industry, right? They have less confidence to push back. But I think you need to understand that
[00:18:29] that company wants you as well. And so with that being said, doing that due diligence, really
[00:18:34] making sure it's a great fit for you is really something that I would encourage you to do. The other
[00:18:39] thing that this wasn't a thing in my day and age, but I think the concept of teams is a great learning
[00:18:46] capacity. Now that being said, I think there's two types of teams. I think there are teams that are
[00:18:51] built to basically, basically prioritize the little team lead and manage their business. And then I
[00:18:59] think they're their teams that are built to basically try and create a winning environment for
[00:19:04] the team people in there. And there's a big difference between that two. But in my experience,
[00:19:08] even once agents learn what they need to learn, the biggest thing holding the back in success
[00:19:14] is confidence or lack thereof. I have agents that I've worked with that are so smart of what they do,
[00:19:20] but they're so afraid of getting asked a question that they can't answer and being caught in that
[00:19:25] situation that they don't feel as confident to go out after the business because they're afraid
[00:19:31] to get asked something they don't. So like, for example, the way our team is structured is that when we
[00:19:35] do have newer agents on it, I want to put them in the scenarios very safely and protectively,
[00:19:42] where they're doing things that they couldn't necessarily do unless they had more business. I want
[00:19:46] them to do more showings. I want them to meet the contractors. I want them to sit through inspections.
[00:19:50] All these things with your ears open so you're absorbing from all these different pieces so that
[00:19:55] when you do get that client and you are working through a transaction, you know what an inspection.
[00:19:59] Like, you know what meeting contractors are like, you know all these different pieces and you also know
[00:20:04] you've got a very strong backbone to come and ask questions to. So the team concept in my mind is
[00:20:09] something like, gosh, I wish it was around when I came in. I was asking a lot of questions to
[00:20:15] my managing broker. I was very, very fortunate that at the time I had a couple of great people in
[00:20:20] the office that would let me bang on their door at all the time asking for advice. But I know that
[00:20:25] a lot of people, especially in this day, at major, aren't always as comfortable to go up to a senior
[00:20:29] agent and say, hey, can you help me in this? And that's where I think the team environment definitely
[00:20:33] would be something that I would at least explore if I was getting into the business now.
[00:20:38] That's all such amazing advice. I just had a few thoughts while you were saying that. And two,
[00:20:44] my one thought that I wanted to mandate your reaction to, especially for newer agents, you know,
[00:20:50] this is this idea of being afraid of what you don't know. Yes, of course you are. Like totally normal,
[00:20:55] rational, reasonable, don't beat yourself up for being afraid of being asked a question you don't know.
[00:21:00] Yes, it's scary because you don't want to look like you don't know what you're doing, of course.
[00:21:05] But there are, that's just going to happen. So anyone who's practiced long enough probably
[00:21:09] still gets questions that they don't have an immediate answer to, but certainly new agents. And so I
[00:21:13] I encourage all of the new agents who join us. And we have, well, two things. First, whatever firm
[00:21:20] you're at, ask them, let's say I'm at a showing, it's three o'clock on a Tuesday and a client
[00:21:26] asks a question and I don't know the answer. You know, I'm going to step away and then I'm going to,
[00:21:31] you know, how can I reach out to the firm and what would be a reasonable expectation of how quickly
[00:21:36] I could get an answer back just so I could then communicate that to my clients. Hey, I'm going
[00:21:40] to double check with my team. I'll get back to you tomorrow or whatever or in an hour or whatever
[00:21:44] is reasonable. So have that process mapped out already in your mind and then say to the client,
[00:21:50] boy, that's an amazing question. I'm going to double check with my team because I want to give you
[00:21:53] a really good answer. And I just want to double check something. You know, you could even make it
[00:21:57] sound like you're thinking about it and you know, you can act out that you have an answer, but you
[00:22:01] want to double check on it. But making sure you have that locked and loaded, I think is really
[00:22:06] helpful. And I think most people are completely understanding of, oh, I want to go check with my
[00:22:11] team and get sure that makes sense. I'm curious what your thoughts are. 1000%. In fact, I always tell
[00:22:16] my team, and we're talking about this and doing some role playing, there are questions that I'm
[00:22:22] going to get asked. I'm 21 years in and I've done a tremendous amount of business and I get questions
[00:22:27] asked all the time that I'm like, I'm not a real index. Like I know a lot, but there's certain
[00:22:32] things that I'd say the number one question that we get asked all the time is somebody's going to
[00:22:36] say, we're going to walk through a property and they're going to say, hey, what do you think this
[00:22:39] is worth? Number one question we get. Sure. And the reality is is that we cover a very large area
[00:22:47] in the city, right? We do predominantly from the South Loop, North Thorodges Park and everything
[00:22:51] in between. And so with that, there can be a lot of different property types that come up.
[00:22:57] There is no one in the world that can tell you if they walk in a property in that span and come
[00:23:01] out to say, is it priced exactly right? Now I can give you a gut. I can say, hey, sure, it's,
[00:23:05] it's, I don't think it's out of line, but I want to check a few things to make sure that it's right.
[00:23:10] I can say, gosh, that really feels overpriced. But like, so that's something that I tell all the team.
[00:23:14] I said, you know what I say in that instance? I say, just that. Hey, you know what? My gut is,
[00:23:19] is that it's fairly appropriate, but I want to check what a couple of closings just finished up
[00:23:24] that I didn't see what they finalized that net will have impact. Let me get back to you later today.
[00:23:28] Just like that, I always say, have, have these certain sayings have some reason to be comfortable
[00:23:34] to go back to say, this is something that, that we want more information on, just so that I can
[00:23:41] provide you the most recent, most exact thing. Hey, I want to, I want to just touch face with my
[00:23:46] team lead. I have a good idea on this, but I know she thinks about it a little bit differently
[00:23:50] than I am. Love to provide you kind of with something a little bit more well-rounded. Anything like that,
[00:23:54] people don't think twice on that's going to come across way better to a consumer than giving
[00:24:00] them a made up answer that probably isn't right. Yeah, there used to be some weird statistic and I
[00:24:05] don't remember it exactly, but it was something that, that was popular for a while and, and I really
[00:24:11] encourage people to not take this advice, which is more people are more willing to accept a
[00:24:18] wrong answer fast than the right answer slow, make the right answer slow. I think that is,
[00:24:22] that is the way better, but tell them say I need to do some numbers and talk to somebody I want.
[00:24:27] Yeah, so I am right with you on that one. By the way, I want to also just reprimote,
[00:24:32] I want everyone to visit ChicagoRealTalk.com. As you've noticed, how Amanda has been communicating
[00:24:38] with us thus far, you know, she has just a lot of information, a lot of wisdom, and I want you
[00:24:44] to really emulate some of the ways in which she communicates. So by, by subscribing to her
[00:24:49] podcast on YouTube, again, if you go to ChicagoRealTalk.com, it'll take you there, subscribe, and notice
[00:24:54] which the way that she communicates to clients because she is a master communicator, and this is
[00:25:00] really something that I want you, whether you're Chicago or not, to just get an awareness of how she
[00:25:05] does it, because almost all of her business is referral, 95%. So let's talk about that, you know,
[00:25:12] leads, leads are everything, right? People want leads, they want to figure out, you know, how to have,
[00:25:18] have more business, and this is the year where everyone's struggling a little bit more maybe,
[00:25:23] than in the last couple of years. So I'm curious on what you are telling your team to focus on right now
[00:25:29] for keeping leads generated while interest rates are high, lending rates are high rather, and of course
[00:25:36] inventory is not as high as we would like it to be. Absolutely. You know, so it's interesting when I
[00:25:42] first got into this business, and I process things, I'm a processor, I'm very data driven, I
[00:25:47] overthink everything, if anything, I get my own way sometimes of my business because I'm trying to
[00:25:52] over strategize things. So when I decide something, I can promise you there's a lot of thought
[00:25:57] process that goes into it. When I got into this business, I looked at it and said a couple things.
[00:26:03] Number one is I told you I was already an introverted personality type. So that was one of the things
[00:26:08] that I really, really wanted to focus on, to say, okay, what type of business model is best going to
[00:26:15] suit me? Is the idea of cold calling people going to be natural to me? Probably not. Is the idea
[00:26:20] door knocking? Right? We're going back 21 years people did door knock. Is that going to come across
[00:26:25] naturally? Even open houses, I wasn't very good at, right? Of course, I've done all these things in
[00:26:31] my career, and I've tried to over the years get better at these things. But really when I looked at
[00:26:35] how I had thrived in some of my past accomplishments and who I was, I really knew that a referral
[00:26:42] based business model was going to be right for me because it came down to the fact that first and
[00:26:46] foremost, it's the most client-centric model, right? For me to be successful, my clients have to be
[00:26:51] very happy with what I do and very successful in what they do. So I knew that that was something,
[00:26:56] that success is something that I could deliver and something that I could control within who I was
[00:27:01] because the reality is, is one on one with my clients, that's my comfort zone. That is where I thrive.
[00:27:07] So the idea of creating this business model that essentially meant if I leave all my clients as
[00:27:12] raving fans that they're going to do that dirty work for me that I don't necessarily think I'm
[00:27:17] good at, it was a no-brainer to get to there. Now, the catch to this business model, here is the
[00:27:22] catch and it is a big one. If you are going to talk to talk, you have to be willing to walk the
[00:27:27] walk. If you are going to run a referral based business model, you better be a hack of an agent to
[00:27:33] those clients. Because the only reason that they want to talk about you is because you left them
[00:27:38] feeling really good about what happened. And as I always tell people, is that the success of a client
[00:27:45] doesn't necessarily mean a closing. I've had a lot of referral sources that I have talked out of
[00:27:50] buying and selling, climbing and climbing out for years, that they have never spent a commission
[00:27:54] dollar with me. But they've probably referred me dozens of clients. So, you know, for me, that
[00:28:00] rough that model was always something that was good because it was very controllable to me.
[00:28:05] And it also really highlighted my skill sets of where I thought I could thrive. Now, we have over
[00:28:11] the years within the team, I don't necessarily work online leads. We have worked them into our team
[00:28:17] structure for some of the team agents. But I'm also looking at it when I got into this business,
[00:28:21] I had a whole lot of nothing, right? I didn't have a pad and bank account. I didn't have a huge
[00:28:27] network. I didn't have all these things. So, the idea of spending money on leads seemed
[00:28:32] not not realistic for me. So, for me, it was the ability that if I can go out there, if I could do
[00:28:37] great, if I could really advise well, right? And there were times that it was really hard because,
[00:28:43] like I said, there wasn't there wasn't all the financial backing in what I was doing. But if you really
[00:28:47] do a great job and advise well and make sure that your clients know that what you're telling them to
[00:28:51] do is absolutely in their best interest, then a referral based business model is something that can
[00:28:56] just thrive over the years. You just said something that I thought was super interesting. And I'd like
[00:29:02] to explore it a little bit because it really lit me up when you said this in just the best way,
[00:29:08] which was talking clients out of a transaction when it's not in their best interest. This to me is
[00:29:17] where the juice is of what most agents, you know, it's not that they want someone to make the wrong
[00:29:24] decision necessarily. They just maybe don't want to get in the middle of the decision and sort of
[00:29:29] be the reason somebody buys or doesn't buy. I'm just sort of hypothesizing, but I most agents,
[00:29:36] I think don't do this. They don't say, this is a really good buy or a bad buy or a good say,
[00:29:41] you know, this is good for you. This is maybe not so good for you. I think REALTORS have
[00:29:47] in their wanting to just sort of stay neutral and maybe just fear of making the wrong
[00:29:53] suggestion, you know, oftentimes don't give those recommendations. They're like, you want to put
[00:29:57] an offer in? We can put an offer in. I'll give you some suggestions. If you want to put an offer
[00:30:00] in, but should I put an offer in? Maybe it's whatever it's at least for me. That's all I want from
[00:30:08] any of my service providers in my life. I want them to say, this is a good idea. And DJ, what we know
[00:30:13] about you, this is a bad idea. And I, I will be with that person for the rest of my life if they do
[00:30:19] that. So I love the fact that you're willing to say, you know, based on everything I know about
[00:30:24] you, this may or may not be a good idea. So just to kind of branch off on that, I do like to clarify,
[00:30:29] I don't make any of my clients decisions for them. And I know of course that I'm not going to make
[00:30:33] their decisions for them. That being said, people ask me all the time, I made a, what was,
[00:30:38] what was the point in your, what your business really took off? What did you do? What happened? And
[00:30:50] nine to 2011. Yeah. During that time, I, and this has been my mantra since the very beginning,
[00:30:57] but I think it became much more easy to vocalize and broadcast during that time. I will tell you
[00:31:04] exactly what I think is in your best interest, regardless of anything else. Right. And so during that,
[00:31:11] that time, I was giving a lot of advice to say, I know you want to sell to buy this. I know you
[00:31:17] want to do this, but here's the things I need you to think about because realistically, I don't
[00:31:21] think it gets you to your end goal. Now, that is absolutely talking myself out of business. Absolutely,
[00:31:27] 1000%. There's no, there's no qualm about it. But what it did do is I did that time and time and time
[00:31:33] and time again during that time period. And people started to realize very, very quickly that if I
[00:31:38] gave somebody advice, it was very real. It was very accurate and it had absolutely nothing to do with
[00:31:42] my own personal benefit. And that is when my reputation took a giant leap forward because
[00:31:49] if you tell somebody not to do business, if you tell somebody to not employ you and not take
[00:31:54] a step forward on something, I will almost guarantee you they will tell everybody that they know how
[00:32:01] great the advice was that their real estate agent just gave them. And I have done more business
[00:32:07] off of telling people not to not to do things if that's what I thought, then, then the alternative,
[00:32:12] because you build trust. It's like, it's kind of like when you find a reputable auto mechanic,
[00:32:21] or you just hold on to them for your dear life, because you're like, I don't want to worry about
[00:32:27] whether you're ripping me off or telling me I need to fix this thing in my car. I just, you know,
[00:32:31] you just want to trust somebody when they say you need to fix this in this in your car. You just
[00:32:34] go, okay, good. I don't have to worry about my mechanic anymore or my account or my attorney or
[00:32:40] my financial advisor or my REALTOR. I mean, just the idea of being able to go to somebody and say,
[00:32:47] look, I know you can help me buy this home. I can, I understand you can do that. But what, in your,
[00:32:52] you know, based on what you know about me, should I consider this, will this get me to where I want
[00:32:56] to go? And that's the part where I think REALTOR's can really step up. And like you said,
[00:33:01] and differentiate themselves and be and be not just a, hey, I've got a question about X, Y, and Z,
[00:33:06] be an actual source of wisdom. And I think that's really what we're talking about is you
[00:33:11] are saying, I have some wisdom here. And this is my opinion about what is coming through in my
[00:33:16] wisdom. And that's worth its weight in gold. And everybody wants to be to receive wisdom. We
[00:33:22] don't always listen. But, but we love hearing it because we want an opinion from an expert. That's
[00:33:27] really why your, you know, REALTOR's get paid so incredibly well to, to help people buy and sell
[00:33:33] homes. I think it's, it's a lot of its mechanical. And then a lot of it's like, I, like you were
[00:33:38] saying, just telling people the actual truth that, that way you see it, giving your opinion and,
[00:33:44] and then having them say, wow, my, my REALTOR really is looking out for me. My REALTOR obviously
[00:33:48] cares about me. And I think that's in really what you're, you're demonstrating, you're demonstrating
[00:33:52] care. And everybody wants to be cared for. So I, I applaud you for that. So if somebody doesn't feel
[00:34:00] confident, confident, being able to, you know, maybe they're new to the business. And they're like,
[00:34:04] I don't know if, some, if this purchase or the sale for my client is in their best interest. I
[00:34:09] truly just don't have enough experience. That's where you would then go to a trainer or a coach
[00:34:14] or your managing broker and say, can you help me figure out if this is, if this looks like it may be
[00:34:19] in their best interest? Is that what you would suggest? 1000% ask lots of questions, ask questions to
[00:34:24] people that have done it longer, have done it differently. Whatever the case may be, like I am a
[00:34:29] huge person that I believe collaboration is the way that we all move forward. Right? Even at my
[00:34:34] level, I'm constantly throwing ideas against people, asking people ideas like, this is how we grow
[00:34:39] as an industry. This is how we get better as an industry. We are not, not alone shipped by any means.
[00:34:47] In fact, I read a book, one of the books that I always say kind of changed my career. There's a
[00:34:52] gentleman by the name of Tim Saunders. He back in the day, right? Back 27 years ago, he was the Chief
[00:34:57] Solutions Officer for Yahoo. He's now taken on his own role. He's a fascinating and brilliant,
[00:35:02] brilliant businessman. I saw him speak when I was very early in the business and he wrote a book
[00:35:07] and what's interesting about this book is it was very ahead of its time and it's called Love
[00:35:11] the Killer App. Now what's interesting is this was back in, I think the publishing day was either
[00:35:17] late 90s or the very early 2000s. We didn't have apps at that time. Right. But the whole mindset was
[00:35:24] just that is that he talked about the fact that we had evolved, right? If we look at past times,
[00:35:29] especially in a sales-based business, it was so much about the sharks and the varicutas.
[00:35:33] Like, this is my business. I can't share and collaborate with somebody else because they're
[00:35:36] my competition. They're going to take my business. It's very fear-based.
[00:35:40] And very aggression-based. Like, very like, I need to beat you and yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:35:45] And he kind of brought up the idea and just said, hey guys, there's enough business for all of us.
[00:35:49] What if we change that mindset? What if we call us and he kind of termed this term,
[00:35:54] he coined this term, LoveCats. And he said, what if we collaborate a little bit more? What if we
[00:35:59] go to our competitors and say, how are you doing this? This is how I'm doing this? And what if we all
[00:36:02] get better together? Don't we just create a better industry? And that is something the book is
[00:36:07] phenomenal. The me-watching him speak at one point in time was phenomenal and it impacted the entire
[00:36:12] way I've done the business over the last two years or two decades. Thank you for that recommendation.
[00:36:17] We will put a link to is called Love is the Killer app, how to win business and influence friends.
[00:36:21] You're right. 2003. And Tim Sanders is the guy, as the author and we will post a link to that great,
[00:36:28] great suggestion. Now, you know, it's interesting. You talk about how you have really taken your business
[00:36:36] to the next level by thinking from a marketing perspective, I want raving fans, which means
[00:36:41] really you're focusing exclusively on the client or not exclusively. I'm sure you do some marketing,
[00:36:45] but the client experience. So what is the client experience? How do you know if it's a successful
[00:36:51] client experience? Because let's just say that let's say every single time the transaction completes.
[00:36:56] But that doesn't necessarily mean a great client experience. So how do you define that was a good
[00:37:02] client experience versus that one we missed it a little bit? Well, I like to think we haven't missed it.
[00:37:07] So no, it's interesting. When I was newer in the business and I remember very, very clearly, Dave Hanna,
[00:37:17] who was a huge mentor and a huge impact on my life, he was one of the managing brokers at
[00:37:21] Printing Film Prefered Properties when I started up weight all those years ago. And he really
[00:37:25] took me under as wing because he knew I was inquisitive and he knew I had a lot of things that I was
[00:37:30] trying to figure out. I remember at one point in time, he pulled me aside and he said to me, he goes,
[00:37:35] I'm gonna, here's some advice I'm gonna give you. You've got to learn not to take everything so
[00:37:39] personally is that you take it to personally and at some point now it's okay, but at some point
[00:37:43] it's going to burn you out. Now once again, I'm a processor. So I walked away from that conversation,
[00:37:48] very grateful that it happened. I processed it for the next two days and then I went back to him and
[00:37:52] I said, hey, I want to revisit that conversation. Of course, he was so busy at the time, he's like,
[00:37:56] what conversation is that? And I said, the one where you told me that I take things to personally,
[00:38:00] and that that was going to burn me out. And I said, I appreciate what you had to say and I think
[00:38:04] there's absolutely some value in it. But I think one of the things that's going to make me different,
[00:38:09] then one of the things that's really going to make me great is that I do take those things
[00:38:12] personally is that I literally get on that roller coaster ride with my clients and I ride the highs
[00:38:17] and I ride the lows so that when we get off that ride, we are both at the same endeavor for better
[00:38:21] or for worse. And yes, I think I think what he was trying to tell me at that point, but I wasn't
[00:38:25] ready to hear was the fact that I needed to learn how to kind of turn the emotional part of it off.
[00:38:33] So stay that invested, stay on that ride, but maybe learn to kind of not get myself so worked up
[00:38:39] in it, right? That's the experience that we learn. But you know, that's something that I really took
[00:38:43] forward in this business is that I think any one of my clients will tell you is that I am in,
[00:38:48] I am in the transaction, I am in the heat of it. And it doesn't matter if you're buying a $200,000
[00:38:52] or you're selling a $3.5 million home, we treat every one of our clients the exact same because
[00:38:58] they deserve that from us. And we limit the number of clients that will work with at one time,
[00:39:03] as I'll tell any agents, I don't, you're never going to see me in the top 10 agents of Chicago.
[00:39:08] I have a ton of respect for those that are, but the way that we run our business model with what we
[00:39:13] do with the level of service that we commit to people, we restrict the number of clients that we're
[00:39:17] going to work with at one time because we literally commit so much to them and we have structured
[00:39:21] our small intimate team to really focusing on the level of service. I was told so many times as I
[00:39:28] grew up in this industry that the service has to take a step back as the business grows. And that
[00:39:34] is something that I refuse to believe over the years. And I truly believe that our business is
[00:39:39] showing that. If you go online, if you Google the team, if you look at all the reviews, you're going
[00:39:44] to struggle to find a negative one. In fact, I think the only real negative ones you find out
[00:39:48] there are typically from the other side that was a little angry that I that I enforce the situation
[00:39:53] that that shouldn't needed to be enforced. So I truly believe we stay very connected. We're connected
[00:39:58] with all of our clients throughout it. Sure, there's absolutely things that happen that are outside
[00:40:02] of our control. Of course, on the other side that can leave some bad taste, but I'm a full believer
[00:40:07] that communication is key in all of this stuff. So even when things are going wrong, we are trying
[00:40:13] to be right at the forefront of everything happening to make sure that at the end of the day,
[00:40:17] our clients, you know what, they may not have liked some of the things that happen, but they're
[00:40:21] going to be happy with how we managed and how we dealt with some of the curve balls along the way.
[00:40:25] And on the flip side, it's even more dangerous to do a less than ideal, to have a less than
[00:40:34] ideal performance with a client because the certain studies have shown that people are more
[00:40:42] likely to spread, you know, hey, my agent wasn't very good versus was good. So you really have to
[00:40:48] do it for two reasons. One, you want referrals and you want to do a good job for your clients.
[00:40:52] So you want that reputation. But if you don't, the downside is they're not going to talk either,
[00:40:56] they're not going to talk about you at all to their friends or they're going to say, well, they were
[00:40:59] okay, but you know, I felt like maybe maybe they could have done more or less or more or, you know,
[00:41:05] listened more or been more proactive. So you focus so much on the client experience because that
[00:41:11] becomes your marketing. That's the result of that is all your marketing essentially is done for
[00:41:16] you. It doesn't mean you have an easy life. Like, of course, it's not easy to give an exceptional
[00:41:22] experience to every single client. But if you hyper focus on that, like you said, whether it's 200,000
[00:41:28] or million dollar properties, you are going to have people that go, wow, and you know, I think the
[00:41:35] wow factor in this industry is not as hard to achieve as people may think. It certainly takes a ton
[00:41:42] of work. No question about it. But is it it's difficult because it's a lot of work. But going that
[00:41:48] extra mile is is really every I've interviewed almost 500 top agents now, they all go the extra mile.
[00:41:55] And they all say that. And I hope that, you know, what does the extra mile look like for you?
[00:42:00] Well, you know, it's funny. You say that I I'm going to deviate a little bit from your question
[00:42:04] because I think it's a really important thing to note. I personally think that in our world
[00:42:11] to be a good agent is incredibly obtainable. Incredibly. To be a great agent takes another
[00:42:19] another level of that perspective. But if you want to make a good living, if you want to have
[00:42:24] a good business that you are very proud of and a substantial income and everything like that,
[00:42:29] I truly believe it. Just what anybody can go out there and do it because it's literally about
[00:42:35] showing up, doing the job, knowing what's expected of you, delivering results. It's literally,
[00:42:41] as I like to say, the threshold is not that high that it's something that an elitist group can get.
[00:42:48] Now, I do think that there's an absolute large step to get into a level of greatness. And for me,
[00:42:53] that's where a lot of strategy and sophistication comes from. And it's the same thing
[00:42:59] of people tell me all the time. They say, are you are you afraid that your job, that your industry
[00:43:04] is going to go away? Right? All the information is out there. The reality is all the information
[00:43:09] is out there right now. And people are still very reliant on what we do. I don't think our careers
[00:43:13] as top agents are really threatened at all because the reality is is my value to my clients. Sure,
[00:43:20] I can find a property. Sure, I can put together a strategy. But the reality is is everything that's
[00:43:24] in here to help navigate what's happening out there. It's the plans that we're putting into place,
[00:43:30] the strategies to get there when we hit certain roadblocks. It's knowing where to side step.
[00:43:35] What build condo buildings are run in a manner? It's it's a stuff that they don't, they can get the
[00:43:40] information, but they certainly don't know how to digest it. Absolutely. I'm curious to what are you
[00:43:46] doing in between transactions to keep your clients aware that you're still out there practicing,
[00:43:55] making sure they don't forget your name, let's say. So you know, maybe they buy your
[00:43:59] cell home every five, seven years. So you have this large swath of time in between. How are you staying
[00:44:05] in communication with them so that they when they're ready again that they're like, Amanda's the person?
[00:44:10] For certain. And that's I think the name of the game of where we really have to concentrate our
[00:44:14] efforts as somebody that runs a referral based based business model because the reality is,
[00:44:18] is most my clients aren't in the market for so many years. And if I'm not in contact with them,
[00:44:23] they may not be as quick to be in a conversation to say, oh, wait, I love my REALTOR and I want to
[00:44:28] put you in touch with her. You know, that the methods have definitely changed over the years,
[00:44:34] but I also am a firm believer that it's really about the basics. First and foremost, we need to
[00:44:39] keep in contact with them, right? And that really depends on the individual. You know, I'd say 20
[00:44:45] some ideas ago, we created a client appreciation program. Thanks to Brian Bafini for helping with
[00:44:50] the ideas. I didn't spearheaded, I didn't reinvent the coin, but we did personalize it. So they do a
[00:44:56] great program. We started something like that where we set, send a snail mail monthly mailing about
[00:45:03] something in Chicago. Most of it is not really relevant to real estate because right most people don't
[00:45:08] hear too much. Maybe once or twice a year, we send some real estate stuff. But other things,
[00:45:11] more like here's cool events going on or here's just something to know about Chicago or
[00:45:15] certain we do an online, yeah, we do an online digital March Madness pool. We do the top 10 lines
[00:45:21] under 10 bucks. Our favorite Alfresco restaurants for the year. We do a charity toy drive. I mean,
[00:45:26] just stuck to keep people involved, right? And hopefully things that are that are interesting to them
[00:45:32] on some level. So we do that as a snail mail. We obviously over the years thing then move that into
[00:45:37] an email campaign as well. Now we do both. People know that I'm a huge stickler for for snail mail
[00:45:42] in general, right? When I started in the industry, we were all very excited about emails. Now we all
[00:45:46] get hundreds and hundreds a day and we're really excited about mail. I believe in keeping in touch
[00:45:51] with people, you know, and that's different on who it is, whether we're calling them texting them,
[00:45:55] emailing them, trying to set up a coffee date or something, keeping in touch with people,
[00:46:01] and doing it for the right reason. I do it because I genuinely care about those people, right? These are
[00:46:06] people that are important to me. Yes, there's a business aspect to it. But these are people that I
[00:46:11] have the ability to genuinely get involved in their life and care about what's going on. And if you can
[00:46:15] bring that compassion forward, people get it. People understand it. So I would say for people that
[00:46:19] aren't so compassionate, that's a harder piece to emulate. It might not be the right business model
[00:46:24] for you. But for me, that was one of the things. We'll do some client appreciation events throughout
[00:46:28] the year. One of our favorites is like around October. We do photos for professional photos for our
[00:46:34] clients so that they can send out holiday cards. We used to do a big event every year at our
[00:46:39] LinkedIn Rage Track. We were really sad when that went away. But we've done a lot of fun things
[00:46:43] over the city. So we've tried to do some events just to give back and thank them. You know, I'd say that
[00:46:47] in the more recent years, obviously social media has become a big component of it, right? I have a
[00:46:53] love hate relationship with social media. It's an- As does everyone. Right. But you know, I love it and I
[00:47:00] try to say really, really positive about it is that we have the ability to connect with people and
[00:47:04] stay connected on a higher level. So I think for a business perspective, it's a huge advantage if
[00:47:10] you can really use it and use it correctly in terms of just understanding where people are at,
[00:47:15] what's going on in their lives, being supportive, even if it's from afar, having a reason to reach
[00:47:20] out to them from that. So social media has kind of implemented that. As you mentioned before, we just
[00:47:24] were about 11 episodes into our podcast, which once again, that was just an idea that stemmed
[00:47:31] a little bit from the pandemic, but you know, it's kind of interesting is that we found that there are so
[00:47:36] many question marks about the market, right? There's so many things going on, especially during more
[00:47:41] turbulent times, and we have certainly been in turbulent times for the last three years. And it got
[00:47:45] to a point where it was almost a little difficult to try and reach everybody at one point in time. So we
[00:47:51] created the idea of the podcast under the idea that we have so much intel and information we wanted to
[00:47:57] share with people, and that this was at least a platform that we could try and reach a larger base
[00:48:02] to tell our people, hey, I can't, I may not be able to get, you know, 2000 people on the phone this
[00:48:07] month, but I can put these words out there so that they can understand what's going on. And if
[00:48:11] everyone's freaking out, because the media is on this kick to make everyone really scared that we're
[00:48:15] on the brink of a housing crisis, well, then we can talk about that. And hopefully I can have a larger
[00:48:20] span. And it's one of those things that we've been doing enough for, we're coming on a year
[00:48:24] anniversary. It's been a ton of fun for us. And it's one of those things that it's really,
[00:48:30] we've got the moment now and we're really excited to see how people are reacting to it. And I can't
[00:48:35] tell them anytime I see people and they're like, oh my god, thank you so much. Like we didn't want
[00:48:39] to reach out. We didn't want to bother you. We know how busy you are, but just kind of hearing what
[00:48:44] you had to say about it really helps us through this time. And once again, they all comes back to
[00:48:48] that level of compassion and that ability to want to do right in this industry.

But before we get to Amanda, just a couple of ways you can help us and help the show. Best way is to things. Two things.

And let's get to the main event. It's my conversation with Amanda Mcmillan. Okay, today on the show, we have Amanda Mcmillan from Chicago Home Partner here in Chicago with at properties, Christie's International Real Estate. Let me tell you more about Amanda. Amanda Mcmillan is the CEO of Chicago Home Partner, which is an intimate group consistently ranking in the top 50 city agents for both number of transactions and volume. I'm going to pause in reading Amanda's bio here because there's 46,000 real estate agents in the Chicago Ed area. This is a very, very big, amazing statistic that she is in the top 50. They have been the number one team in the at properties, Bucktown location, which is also one of the very top buck at properties locations for the last eight years and is close over 58 million in 2022. Now over the past two decades, Amanda has operated one of the most profitable real estate teams in Chicago, accumulating hundreds of outstanding reviews from raving fans across Google, Zillow, LinkedIn, and Yelp successfully navigating two financial crises, crises, one worldwide pandemic, the birth of two children hosting a bio anti-hosa biweekly podcast at ChicagoRealTalk.com while remaining a social introvert at heart and maintaining a 95% referral based business. I would like everyone to visit ChicagoRealTalk.com and it's going to redirect you to Amanda's YouTube page. I'm going to encourage you, even if you're not a Chicago REALTOR, most of you listening are not. The reason I want you to subscribe is I want you to pay special attention to hear how Amanda talks about the real estate market, how she informs her clients. Her videos are amazing and she is just a wizard at this. So please go subscribe, ChicagoRealTalk.com. We will have a link to that in our show notes. Amanda, welcome to the show. Thanks so much for having me. It's great to be here. I'm excited to have you. Actually, Amanda works very close to where I live. So we were just chatting about our sort of similar neighborhoods. But I am, I've not met you before. So I'm so excited. Usually I talk to people who live like far distances and you are actually about as close of a distance, but yet we haven't met. So I'm super excited to have you on the show. And I think because you describe yourself as an introvert, you know, you're not, you don't make your presence quite as known as some of the other agents here locally, which I actually respect a lot because I think that is the inclination of agents is to, you know, sort of yell it from the mountaintops how great they we are. And I feel like you just, you show, don't tell, which I think is even more impressive. So I just wanted to honor you for being, you know, less in your face, I think, which I always respect agents that are a little bit more subtle. And you certainly fall into that category. And I hope I hope that comes off as a compliment because it's like the best compliment I could think. I don't know that I said it in the best possible way, but it is, it is a compliment. No, absolutely. It's been, it's been a heck of a ride. And yes, I, I will now say 21 years later, I tell people that I'm an extroverted introvert because I've had 21 years in this business in which I've had to train myself to be a little bit more extroverted. But, but I absolutely will be the person to say that the personality type that the media really shows out there doesn't necessarily always go hand in hand with a top producer. Absolutely. And I would love to, you know, I think to, you know, ever since the pandemic started and this is not in any positive thing about the pandemic. But one thing that did change is I think introverts in particular, people got used to working more remote, you know, doing Zoom meetings. And I think for introverts, that probably was like so wonderful because it allowed introverts to be in their sort of native environment where they're most comfortable. Their energy is not being depleted as much as, and so I just think like never been a better time to be an introverted REALTOR. And the fact that introverts are kind of people are learning more about that and learning more about what they need and how they process information differently. So I think that is, is super cool. I always, there's so many times where I've talked to people wanting to become REALTORS and they go, well, I'm introverted. I don't know if it's a good fit. I'm like, oh, no, it's, it's a good fit. You just have to learn how to do things, you know, maybe differently than somebody who's, you know, really out there and, and, and, you know, being, being super, super social. Not that you're not, of course, I'm sure you are. I always, I've always actually said, I think most consumers on the outside would be surprised to learn how many top producers are actually more introverted in their personality style than the other. I, I, I agree. That, that's almost been not every, I would say more than half of the top producers that I've interviewed, I suspect would identify that way. We were talking about Carrie McCormick, somebody who works at your firm who comes on our show a lot. She definitely considers herself that way as well. So I, I think there is something to it. That is, again, very exciting for, for anybody listening who might think, gosh, I'm not quite, I don't get as much juice out of, you know, being extroverted as I do introverted. So, but I want to start at the very, very beginning of, of how you got into real estate, why real estate. And can you walk us through that journey? Absolutely. It's been a heck of a journey. That's a great word for it. I am first and foremost a third generation REALTOR. So I was born into it. It was in my blood. I will tell most people my first experiences with it was when I was working my mom's open houses in broker opens when I was a teenager, she would essentially pay me $50, which was a tremendous amount of money. Good money. You can't answer any questions. You sit there and if anybody says anything, you give them my card. So I wasn't doing anything unethical or wrong or anything like that. But that was my introduction. As I moved into my young adult years, I absolutely will say that I think the backing behind why I ended up in this industry is because when we were around the dinner table and we were talking about life aspirations, my parents would continually say to myself and my sister, they said, girls, when you grow up, you can be anything you want. You want to be a movie star, you want to be president, you want to be a doctor, you can be anything you want. What do you want to be side note? You can't go into real estate. Now the reason they said that is that my mother's sold residential real estate for 30 plus years. My father was in commercial real estate for almost as long. You know, as I like to tell people, it's not that they didn't think it was a wonderful industry. It's just that at that time when I was growing up in the 80s, it just looked at as a different type of industry and it wasn't necessarily where you wanted to end up. It's kind of what you fell into a little bit more. And with that being said, they told me that at a very, very young age now anybody that knows me and knows me well says that I probably hid that in the back of my psyche that somebody told me not to do something so that when the time came to be, I said, wait a second. You told me I shouldn't do that. I'm going to do it and I'm going to show you how I knock it out of the park when I do it. So long story short, it was in my blood. I was kind of told to stay away from it and therefore I ran at it full force. I love that you rebelled by going, I'm going to do exactly what you did mom and dad and maybe grandpa grandpa grandma. No, no, but I I love that and it makes perfect sense because obviously you you just were exposed to it. It's such a young age you you didn't have the same experience of somebody graduating college going, gosh, what do I do now? And then maybe like you said, maybe falling into real estate when, you know, maybe they went to school for marketing or some other purpose and maybe didn't, you know, couldn't find a foothold in that career. And then some of the people fall back on real estate. But I love the fact that it was clearly in your in your genes and and you didn't ignore that even though your parents were like, we want we want you to do other things. Well, I didn't say there's one little interesting tidbit to it because there was a side venture before I before I decided to come back to one one of my degrees actually I had a double major in college and one of my degrees is actually in a question in studies for those that don't know that is the study of horses. I actually rode professionally. Horses have always been a part of my life. They still are to this day. I rode professionally out of college and I did that thing where I followed one of my absolute passions and it's one of those things that when you follow one of your absolute passions into life and into profession, sometimes it loses some of the passion and you realize that maybe it wasn't the right idea. Yeah. So I did have an interesting side endeavor, but it was pretty quick. I actually got back into the real estate world by the time I was 24. Are you are you still riding today? I am for better for worse. Sometimes people say I'm a little nuts and a little crazy. I do still ride and I still ride and I'm pretty competitive level. And then do you ride? Okay, I'm going to ask you the one question I know about equestrian, which is do you ride dressage or that's the only thing I know, right? Is that the right word? That is the right word. Very good. Dressage is the flatwork, a little bit artistry, a little bit like dancing. That's not what I do. I do jumping. So I like big jumps and I like to jump in the fastest I can. Amazing. And where do you so do you live in the city? I know your offices here. Are you out? No, just out of curiosity because now I'm fascinated about where the horse is. So I'm our primary residence is in the city. Our horses live out near Libertyville. So they're not far from the city. We do have a farm as well in northwest Illinois. That's the I always joke and say that I love the city. I love everything about it, but I'm not always a city person so that we have a little bit of an ability to get a 24 hour escape when we need to. I will tell you I did. I went to Miraval, which is this sort of new AG fancy place in Tucson with my mom years ago to kind of where like wealthy people go to chill out and relax and find themselves. But but I my mom won this trip there and so we went and we got to to to really spend time with with horses and and learn learn about how to clean them and groom them. And it was part of a therapeutic process of getting in connection and and it was actually quite relaxing and peaceful. And yeah, so that that's also my I didn't mean to get caught up on on on your equestrian stuff, but it's very cool, especially for people who live in the city. Super cool. So so you you got into real estate, you know, your parents said no, you said yes. And then what what you know, you've seen gosh hundreds if not thousands of agents come and go. I'm sure in that time frame, what do you think made the difference for you in terms of success? Like you've seen people make it you've seen people who don't make it. What do you think was were some of the reasons why you did better? And obviously having, you know, family into where you probably were more more attuned to it. But what do you think made the difference for you? I wish I could say that there was some sort of special pill or some some magic thing that I did. The reality is is I worked my ass off. I mean, there's no Katie coding that is that, you know, it's funny. I try I talked to it and I mentor a lot of younger agents and stuff like that. And the reality is the first market I ever stepped into was just post September 11th. I joined the industry in 2002. So that was that was my introduction. Now I didn't know any difference. So it was fine. But the reality is that I entered the market at a time of complete crisis. Now in hindsight, 21 years later and three crisis later, I think that that probably shaped a lot of the way that I work with my clients. But I came in from the start and I am always one of those believers that we are in charge of our own destiny, so to say. And that if I want to succeed in something, I know the odds are stacked against me. What am I going to do? I'm going to work incredibly hard to get there. Now, I think the hardest part for a newer agent is you don't always know what to work harder on. You know, I think that that's one of the question marks okay, sure, I can show up and say I'm going to work hard. But a lot of times it's the question is the what where, why, how, when. So for me, when I first got into the industry, I knew I needed one thing. I needed training, right? That is all I needed. This was not an era in which there were teams or anything like that. Somebody that would take me under their wing. So I at the time looked for the company that I didn't know if I'd stay with them long term, but I looked for the company that in my opinion had the absolute best training possible. And I joined them because I knew 1,000 percent at that point in time I needed that. So if somebody was going to give me the training and then somebody was going to put it back on me to execute all of those pieces, well, then I was at least setting myself up for better success. It's actually really a really rational and sort of logical approach that I think a lot of newer agents don't know how critical the training. Well, it's tough. I think about this a lot because you get your you pass the exam, you get your license, you join a firm and every firm's calling you at the same time. So you're getting all of these, at least here in Illinois, they everyone's data gets sold, every brokerage. So we're all calling at the same time going, please join our firm. And everybody says they have great training. That's the other thing too is then trying to figure out which firms actually do a good job of that, not all firms do at properties where you are is absolutely known for having exceptional training. It always has ever since I've been in this industry. So you certainly, you know, you certainly at a good firm. And I don't know if you started there, but you're at a firm now that absolutely is well known for that. So, you know, is that something that you recommend when you talk to newer agents is like, hey, if when you're choosing a firm, you know, think about what the training options are and how, just out of curiosity, how might you, if you were new today, how might you start to figure out which firms do a better job of that than others is, do you, would you have any suggestions for agents that maybe this year are thinking maybe I should switch firms or look at other options, you know, because everyone does say I have good training. Right. No, absolutely, absolutely. I think it takes definitely a lot of due diligence upfront because the reality is, as you said, if when you get your license, anybody's going to give you a shot, right? The reality is it's, it's not a leap. You can work anywhere. Special. Anybody will hire you. So the fact that someone's calling you and so it's calling you, they feel great, but it really doesn't mean much. In terms of finding out the training, obviously you want to sit down, you know, with the managing brokers, you want to hear what they have to say, but the reality is, is most managing brokers are accomplished agents that at some point in time decided to take a step back and doing it another way. So that's a salesperson that's trying to sell you on the training and they should probably be pretty good, especially if they got put into that role to help coach agents in that capacity. So that's a good starting point because I think there's certain companies that, A, just when you go in and you meet with people, I think you're going to connect on certain levels and you're not going to feel right. So first and for most, trust your gut. Trust what you feel in that connection. Did you, did you feel appropriate sitting down? Did it feel like the office and everything like that had what you were looking for? Or did it feel off in any way? The next thing I would do is I would absolutely ask to talk to a couple of agents in that office. If you don't know any yourself, ask the managing brokers, say, hey, I'd love to talk to an agent. I'd like to talk to somebody very, very experienced. And I'd like to talk to somebody that maybe has been newer in your program in the last six to 12 months because then you can ask them what they have gone through and how it has come to be from that perspective. So I think that doing a little bit more due diligence, don't be afraid to ask. I think a lot of people when they join this industry, especially if they are younger and it's a first industry, right? They have less confidence to push back. But I think you need to understand that that company wants you as well. And so with that being said, doing that due diligence, really making sure it's a great fit for you is really something that I would encourage you to do. The other thing that this wasn't a thing in my day and age, but I think the concept of teams is a great learning capacity. Now that being said, I think there's two types of teams. I think there are teams that are built to basically, basically prioritize the little team lead and manage their business. And then I think they're their teams that are built to basically try and create a winning environment for the team people in there. And there's a big difference between that two. But in my experience, even once agents learn what they need to learn, the biggest thing holding the back in success is confidence or lack thereof. I have agents that I've worked with that are so smart of what they do, but they're so afraid of getting asked a question that they can't answer and being caught in that situation that they don't feel as confident to go out after the business because they're afraid to get asked something they don't. So like, for example, the way our team is structured is that when we do have newer agents on it, I want to put them in the scenarios very safely and protectively, where they're doing things that they couldn't necessarily do unless they had more business. I want them to do more showings. I want them to meet the contractors. I want them to sit through inspections. All these things with your ears open so you're absorbing from all these different pieces so that when you do get that client and you are working through a transaction, you know what an inspection. Like, you know what meeting contractors are like, you know all these different pieces and you also know you've got a very strong backbone to come and ask questions to. So the team concept in my mind is something like, gosh, I wish it was around when I came in. I was asking a lot of questions to my managing broker. I was very, very fortunate that at the time I had a couple of great people in the office that would let me bang on their door at all the time asking for advice. But I know that a lot of people, especially in this day, at major, aren't always as comfortable to go up to a senior agent and say, hey, can you help me in this? And that's where I think the team environment definitely would be something that I would at least explore if I was getting into the business now. That's all such amazing advice. I just had a few thoughts while you were saying that. And two, my one thought that I wanted to mandate your reaction to, especially for newer agents, you know, this is this idea of being afraid of what you don't know. Yes, of course you are. Like totally normal, rational, reasonable, don't beat yourself up for being afraid of being asked a question you don't know. Yes, it's scary because you don't want to look like you don't know what you're doing, of course. But there are, that's just going to happen. So anyone who's practiced long enough probably still gets questions that they don't have an immediate answer to, but certainly new agents. And so I I encourage all of the new agents who join us. And we have, well, two things. First, whatever firm you're at, ask them, let's say I'm at a showing, it's three o'clock on a Tuesday and a client asks a question and I don't know the answer. You know, I'm going to step away and then I'm going to, you know, how can I reach out to the firm and what would be a reasonable expectation of how quickly I could get an answer back just so I could then communicate that to my clients. Hey, I'm going to double check with my team. I'll get back to you tomorrow or whatever or in an hour or whatever is reasonable. So have that process mapped out already in your mind and then say to the client, boy, that's an amazing question. I'm going to double check with my team because I want to give you a really good answer. And I just want to double check something. You know, you could even make it sound like you're thinking about it and you know, you can act out that you have an answer, but you want to double check on it. But making sure you have that locked and loaded, I think is really helpful. And I think most people are completely understanding of, oh, I want to go check with my team and get sure that makes sense. I'm curious what your thoughts are. 1000%. In fact, I always tell my team, and we're talking about this and doing some role playing, there are questions that I'm going to get asked. I'm 21 years in and I've done a tremendous amount of business and I get questions asked all the time that I'm like, I'm not a real index. Like I know a lot, but there's certain things that I'd say the number one question that we get asked all the time is somebody's going to say, we're going to walk through a property and they're going to say, hey, what do you think this is worth? Number one question we get. Sure. And the reality is is that we cover a very large area in the city, right? We do predominantly from the South Loop, North Thorodges Park and everything in between. And so with that, there can be a lot of different property types that come up. There is no one in the world that can tell you if they walk in a property in that span and come out to say, is it priced exactly right? Now I can give you a gut. I can say, hey, sure, it's, it's, I don't think it's out of line, but I want to check a few things to make sure that it's right. I can say, gosh, that really feels overpriced. But like, so that's something that I tell all the team. I said, you know what I say in that instance? I say, just that. Hey, you know what? My gut is, is that it's fairly appropriate, but I want to check what a couple of closings just finished up that I didn't see what they finalized that net will have impact. Let me get back to you later today. Just like that, I always say, have, have these certain sayings have some reason to be comfortable to go back to say, this is something that, that we want more information on, just so that I can provide you the most recent, most exact thing. Hey, I want to, I want to just touch face with my team lead. I have a good idea on this, but I know she thinks about it a little bit differently than I am. Love to provide you kind of with something a little bit more well-rounded. Anything like that, people don't think twice on that's going to come across way better to a consumer than giving them a made up answer that probably isn't right. Yeah, there used to be some weird statistic and I don't remember it exactly, but it was something that, that was popular for a while and, and I really encourage people to not take this advice, which is more people are more willing to accept a wrong answer fast than the right answer slow, make the right answer slow. I think that is, that is the way better, but tell them say I need to do some numbers and talk to somebody I want. Yeah, so I am right with you on that one. By the way, I want to also just reprimote, I want everyone to visit ChicagoRealTalk.com. As you've noticed, how Amanda has been communicating with us thus far, you know, she has just a lot of information, a lot of wisdom, and I want you to really emulate some of the ways in which she communicates. So by, by subscribing to her podcast on YouTube, again, if you go to ChicagoRealTalk.com, it'll take you there, subscribe, and notice which the way that she communicates to clients because she is a master communicator, and this is really something that I want you, whether you're Chicago or not, to just get an awareness of how she does it, because almost all of her business is referral, 95%. So let's talk about that, you know, leads, leads are everything, right? People want leads, they want to figure out, you know, how to have, have more business, and this is the year where everyone's struggling a little bit more maybe, than in the last couple of years. So I'm curious on what you are telling your team to focus on right now for keeping leads generated while interest rates are high, lending rates are high rather, and of course inventory is not as high as we would like it to be. Absolutely. You know, so it's interesting when I first got into this business, and I process things, I'm a processor, I'm very data driven, I overthink everything, if anything, I get my own way sometimes of my business because I'm trying to over strategize things. So when I decide something, I can promise you there's a lot of thought process that goes into it. When I got into this business, I looked at it and said a couple things. Number one is I told you I was already an introverted personality type. So that was one of the things that I really, really wanted to focus on, to say, okay, what type of business model is best going to suit me? Is the idea of cold calling people going to be natural to me? Probably not. Is the idea door knocking? Right? We're going back 21 years people did door knock. Is that going to come across naturally? Even open houses, I wasn't very good at, right? Of course, I've done all these things in my career, and I've tried to over the years get better at these things. But really when I looked at how I had thrived in some of my past accomplishments and who I was, I really knew that a referral based business model was going to be right for me because it came down to the fact that first and foremost, it's the most client-centric model, right? For me to be successful, my clients have to be very happy with what I do and very successful in what they do. So I knew that that was something, that success is something that I could deliver and something that I could control within who I was because the reality is, is one on one with my clients, that's my comfort zone. That is where I thrive. So the idea of creating this business model that essentially meant if I leave all my clients as raving fans that they're going to do that dirty work for me that I don't necessarily think I'm good at, it was a no-brainer to get to there. Now, the catch to this business model, here is the catch and it is a big one. If you are going to talk to talk, you have to be willing to walk the walk. If you are going to run a referral based business model, you better be a hack of an agent to those clients. Because the only reason that they want to talk about you is because you left them feeling really good about what happened. And as I always tell people, is that the success of a client doesn't necessarily mean a closing. I've had a lot of referral sources that I have talked out of buying and selling, climbing and climbing out for years, that they have never spent a commission dollar with me. But they've probably referred me dozens of clients. So, you know, for me, that rough that model was always something that was good because it was very controllable to me. And it also really highlighted my skill sets of where I thought I could thrive. Now, we have over the years within the team, I don't necessarily work online leads. We have worked them into our team structure for some of the team agents. But I'm also looking at it when I got into this business, I had a whole lot of nothing, right? I didn't have a pad and bank account. I didn't have a huge network. I didn't have all these things. So, the idea of spending money on leads seemed not not realistic for me. So, for me, it was the ability that if I can go out there, if I could do great, if I could really advise well, right? And there were times that it was really hard because, like I said, there wasn't there wasn't all the financial backing in what I was doing. But if you really do a great job and advise well and make sure that your clients know that what you're telling them to do is absolutely in their best interest, then a referral based business model is something that can just thrive over the years. You just said something that I thought was super interesting. And I'd like to explore it a little bit because it really lit me up when you said this in just the best way, which was talking clients out of a transaction when it's not in their best interest. This to me is where the juice is of what most agents, you know, it's not that they want someone to make the wrong decision necessarily. They just maybe don't want to get in the middle of the decision and sort of be the reason somebody buys or doesn't buy. I'm just sort of hypothesizing, but I most agents, I think don't do this. They don't say, this is a really good buy or a bad buy or a good say, you know, this is good for you. This is maybe not so good for you. I think REALTORS have in their wanting to just sort of stay neutral and maybe just fear of making the wrong suggestion, you know, oftentimes don't give those recommendations. They're like, you want to put an offer in? We can put an offer in. I'll give you some suggestions. If you want to put an offer in, but should I put an offer in? Maybe it's whatever it's at least for me. That's all I want from any of my service providers in my life. I want them to say, this is a good idea. And DJ, what we know about you, this is a bad idea. And I, I will be with that person for the rest of my life if they do that. So I love the fact that you're willing to say, you know, based on everything I know about you, this may or may not be a good idea. So just to kind of branch off on that, I do like to clarify, I don't make any of my clients decisions for them. And I know of course that I'm not going to make their decisions for them. That being said, people ask me all the time, I made a, what was, what was the point in your, what your business really took off? What did you do? What happened? And nine to 2011. Yeah. During that time, I, and this has been my mantra since the very beginning, but I think it became much more easy to vocalize and broadcast during that time. I will tell you exactly what I think is in your best interest, regardless of anything else. Right. And so during that, that time, I was giving a lot of advice to say, I know you want to sell to buy this. I know you want to do this, but here's the things I need you to think about because realistically, I don't think it gets you to your end goal. Now, that is absolutely talking myself out of business. Absolutely, 1000%. There's no, there's no qualm about it. But what it did do is I did that time and time and time and time again during that time period. And people started to realize very, very quickly that if I gave somebody advice, it was very real. It was very accurate and it had absolutely nothing to do with my own personal benefit. And that is when my reputation took a giant leap forward because if you tell somebody not to do business, if you tell somebody to not employ you and not take a step forward on something, I will almost guarantee you they will tell everybody that they know how great the advice was that their real estate agent just gave them. And I have done more business off of telling people not to not to do things if that's what I thought, then, then the alternative, because you build trust. It's like, it's kind of like when you find a reputable auto mechanic, or you just hold on to them for your dear life, because you're like, I don't want to worry about whether you're ripping me off or telling me I need to fix this thing in my car. I just, you know, you just want to trust somebody when they say you need to fix this in this in your car. You just go, okay, good. I don't have to worry about my mechanic anymore or my account or my attorney or my financial advisor or my REALTOR. I mean, just the idea of being able to go to somebody and say, look, I know you can help me buy this home. I can, I understand you can do that. But what, in your, you know, based on what you know about me, should I consider this, will this get me to where I want to go? And that's the part where I think REALTOR's can really step up. And like you said, and differentiate themselves and be and be not just a, hey, I've got a question about X, Y, and Z, be an actual source of wisdom. And I think that's really what we're talking about is you are saying, I have some wisdom here. And this is my opinion about what is coming through in my wisdom. And that's worth its weight in gold. And everybody wants to be to receive wisdom. We don't always listen. But, but we love hearing it because we want an opinion from an expert. That's really why your, you know, REALTOR's get paid so incredibly well to, to help people buy and sell homes. I think it's, it's a lot of its mechanical. And then a lot of it's like, I, like you were saying, just telling people the actual truth that, that way you see it, giving your opinion and, and then having them say, wow, my, my REALTOR really is looking out for me. My REALTOR obviously cares about me. And I think that's in really what you're, you're demonstrating, you're demonstrating care. And everybody wants to be cared for. So I, I applaud you for that. So if somebody doesn't feel confident, confident, being able to, you know, maybe they're new to the business. And they're like, I don't know if, some, if this purchase or the sale for my client is in their best interest. I truly just don't have enough experience. That's where you would then go to a trainer or a coach or your managing broker and say, can you help me figure out if this is, if this looks like it may be in their best interest? Is that what you would suggest? 1000% ask lots of questions, ask questions to people that have done it longer, have done it differently. Whatever the case may be, like I am a huge person that I believe collaboration is the way that we all move forward. Right? Even at my level, I'm constantly throwing ideas against people, asking people ideas like, this is how we grow as an industry. This is how we get better as an industry. We are not, not alone shipped by any means. In fact, I read a book, one of the books that I always say kind of changed my career. There's a gentleman by the name of Tim Saunders. He back in the day, right? Back 27 years ago, he was the Chief Solutions Officer for Yahoo. He's now taken on his own role. He's a fascinating and brilliant, brilliant businessman. I saw him speak when I was very early in the business and he wrote a book and what's interesting about this book is it was very ahead of its time and it's called Love the Killer App. Now what's interesting is this was back in, I think the publishing day was either late 90s or the very early 2000s. We didn't have apps at that time. Right. But the whole mindset was just that is that he talked about the fact that we had evolved, right? If we look at past times, especially in a sales-based business, it was so much about the sharks and the varicutas. Like, this is my business. I can't share and collaborate with somebody else because they're my competition. They're going to take my business. It's very fear-based. And very aggression-based. Like, very like, I need to beat you and yeah, yeah, yeah. And he kind of brought up the idea and just said, hey guys, there's enough business for all of us. What if we change that mindset? What if we call us and he kind of termed this term, he coined this term, LoveCats. And he said, what if we collaborate a little bit more? What if we go to our competitors and say, how are you doing this? This is how I'm doing this? And what if we all get better together? Don't we just create a better industry? And that is something the book is phenomenal. The me-watching him speak at one point in time was phenomenal and it impacted the entire way I've done the business over the last two years or two decades. Thank you for that recommendation. We will put a link to is called Love is the Killer app, how to win business and influence friends. You're right. 2003. And Tim Sanders is the guy, as the author and we will post a link to that great, great suggestion. Now, you know, it's interesting. You talk about how you have really taken your business to the next level by thinking from a marketing perspective, I want raving fans, which means really you're focusing exclusively on the client or not exclusively. I'm sure you do some marketing, but the client experience. So what is the client experience? How do you know if it's a successful client experience? Because let's just say that let's say every single time the transaction completes. But that doesn't necessarily mean a great client experience. So how do you define that was a good client experience versus that one we missed it a little bit? Well, I like to think we haven't missed it. So no, it's interesting. When I was newer in the business and I remember very, very clearly, Dave Hanna, who was a huge mentor and a huge impact on my life, he was one of the managing brokers at Printing Film Prefered Properties when I started up weight all those years ago. And he really took me under as wing because he knew I was inquisitive and he knew I had a lot of things that I was trying to figure out. I remember at one point in time, he pulled me aside and he said to me, he goes, I'm gonna, here's some advice I'm gonna give you. You've got to learn not to take everything so personally is that you take it to personally and at some point now it's okay, but at some point it's going to burn you out. Now once again, I'm a processor. So I walked away from that conversation, very grateful that it happened. I processed it for the next two days and then I went back to him and I said, hey, I want to revisit that conversation. Of course, he was so busy at the time, he's like, what conversation is that? And I said, the one where you told me that I take things to personally, and that that was going to burn me out. And I said, I appreciate what you had to say and I think there's absolutely some value in it. But I think one of the things that's going to make me different, then one of the things that's really going to make me great is that I do take those things personally is that I literally get on that roller coaster ride with my clients and I ride the highs and I ride the lows so that when we get off that ride, we are both at the same endeavor for better or for worse. And yes, I think I think what he was trying to tell me at that point, but I wasn't ready to hear was the fact that I needed to learn how to kind of turn the emotional part of it off. So stay that invested, stay on that ride, but maybe learn to kind of not get myself so worked up in it, right? That's the experience that we learn. But you know, that's something that I really took forward in this business is that I think any one of my clients will tell you is that I am in, I am in the transaction, I am in the heat of it. And it doesn't matter if you're buying a $200,000 or you're selling a $3.5 million home, we treat every one of our clients the exact same because they deserve that from us. And we limit the number of clients that will work with at one time, as I'll tell any agents, I don't, you're never going to see me in the top 10 agents of Chicago. I have a ton of respect for those that are, but the way that we run our business model with what we do with the level of service that we commit to people, we restrict the number of clients that we're going to work with at one time because we literally commit so much to them and we have structured our small intimate team to really focusing on the level of service. I was told so many times as I grew up in this industry that the service has to take a step back as the business grows. And that is something that I refuse to believe over the years. And I truly believe that our business is showing that. If you go online, if you Google the team, if you look at all the reviews, you're going to struggle to find a negative one. In fact, I think the only real negative ones you find out there are typically from the other side that was a little angry that I that I enforce the situation that that shouldn't needed to be enforced. So I truly believe we stay very connected. We're connected with all of our clients throughout it. Sure, there's absolutely things that happen that are outside of our control. Of course, on the other side that can leave some bad taste, but I'm a full believer that communication is key in all of this stuff. So even when things are going wrong, we are trying to be right at the forefront of everything happening to make sure that at the end of the day, our clients, you know what, they may not have liked some of the things that happen, but they're going to be happy with how we managed and how we dealt with some of the curve balls along the way. And on the flip side, it's even more dangerous to do a less than ideal, to have a less than ideal performance with a client because the certain studies have shown that people are more likely to spread, you know, hey, my agent wasn't very good versus was good. So you really have to do it for two reasons. One, you want referrals and you want to do a good job for your clients. So you want that reputation. But if you don't, the downside is they're not going to talk either, they're not going to talk about you at all to their friends or they're going to say, well, they were okay, but you know, I felt like maybe maybe they could have done more or less or more or, you know, listened more or been more proactive. So you focus so much on the client experience because that becomes your marketing. That's the result of that is all your marketing essentially is done for you. It doesn't mean you have an easy life. Like, of course, it's not easy to give an exceptional experience to every single client. But if you hyper focus on that, like you said, whether it's 200,000 or million dollar properties, you are going to have people that go, wow, and you know, I think the wow factor in this industry is not as hard to achieve as people may think. It certainly takes a ton of work. No question about it. But is it it's difficult because it's a lot of work. But going that extra mile is is really every I've interviewed almost 500 top agents now, they all go the extra mile. And they all say that. And I hope that, you know, what does the extra mile look like for you? Well, you know, it's funny. You say that I I'm going to deviate a little bit from your question because I think it's a really important thing to note. I personally think that in our world to be a good agent is incredibly obtainable. Incredibly. To be a great agent takes another another level of that perspective. But if you want to make a good living, if you want to have a good business that you are very proud of and a substantial income and everything like that, I truly believe it. Just what anybody can go out there and do it because it's literally about showing up, doing the job, knowing what's expected of you, delivering results. It's literally, as I like to say, the threshold is not that high that it's something that an elitist group can get. Now, I do think that there's an absolute large step to get into a level of greatness. And for me, that's where a lot of strategy and sophistication comes from. And it's the same thing of people tell me all the time. They say, are you are you afraid that your job, that your industry is going to go away? Right? All the information is out there. The reality is all the information is out there right now. And people are still very reliant on what we do. I don't think our careers as top agents are really threatened at all because the reality is is my value to my clients. Sure, I can find a property. Sure, I can put together a strategy. But the reality is is everything that's in here to help navigate what's happening out there. It's the plans that we're putting into place, the strategies to get there when we hit certain roadblocks. It's knowing where to side step. What build condo buildings are run in a manner? It's it's a stuff that they don't, they can get the information, but they certainly don't know how to digest it. Absolutely. I'm curious to what are you doing in between transactions to keep your clients aware that you're still out there practicing, making sure they don't forget your name, let's say. So you know, maybe they buy your cell home every five, seven years. So you have this large swath of time in between. How are you staying in communication with them so that they when they're ready again that they're like, Amanda's the person? For certain. And that's I think the name of the game of where we really have to concentrate our efforts as somebody that runs a referral based based business model because the reality is, is most my clients aren't in the market for so many years. And if I'm not in contact with them, they may not be as quick to be in a conversation to say, oh, wait, I love my REALTOR and I want to put you in touch with her. You know, that the methods have definitely changed over the years, but I also am a firm believer that it's really about the basics. First and foremost, we need to keep in contact with them, right? And that really depends on the individual. You know, I'd say 20 some ideas ago, we created a client appreciation program. Thanks to Brian Bafini for helping with the ideas. I didn't spearheaded, I didn't reinvent the coin, but we did personalize it. So they do a great program. We started something like that where we set, send a snail mail monthly mailing about something in Chicago. Most of it is not really relevant to real estate because right most people don't hear too much. Maybe once or twice a year, we send some real estate stuff. But other things, more like here's cool events going on or here's just something to know about Chicago or certain we do an online, yeah, we do an online digital March Madness pool. We do the top 10 lines under 10 bucks. Our favorite Alfresco restaurants for the year. We do a charity toy drive. I mean, just stuck to keep people involved, right? And hopefully things that are that are interesting to them on some level. So we do that as a snail mail. We obviously over the years thing then move that into an email campaign as well. Now we do both. People know that I'm a huge stickler for for snail mail in general, right? When I started in the industry, we were all very excited about emails. Now we all get hundreds and hundreds a day and we're really excited about mail. I believe in keeping in touch with people, you know, and that's different on who it is, whether we're calling them texting them, emailing them, trying to set up a coffee date or something, keeping in touch with people, and doing it for the right reason. I do it because I genuinely care about those people, right? These are people that are important to me. Yes, there's a business aspect to it. But these are people that I have the ability to genuinely get involved in their life and care about what's going on. And if you can bring that compassion forward, people get it. People understand it. So I would say for people that aren't so compassionate, that's a harder piece to emulate. It might not be the right business model for you. But for me, that was one of the things. We'll do some client appreciation events throughout the year. One of our favorites is like around October. We do photos for professional photos for our clients so that they can send out holiday cards. We used to do a big event every year at our LinkedIn Rage Track. We were really sad when that went away. But we've done a lot of fun things over the city. So we've tried to do some events just to give back and thank them. You know, I'd say that in the more recent years, obviously social media has become a big component of it, right? I have a love hate relationship with social media. It's an- As does everyone. Right. But you know, I love it and I try to say really, really positive about it is that we have the ability to connect with people and stay connected on a higher level. So I think for a business perspective, it's a huge advantage if you can really use it and use it correctly in terms of just understanding where people are at, what's going on in their lives, being supportive, even if it's from afar, having a reason to reach out to them from that. So social media has kind of implemented that. As you mentioned before, we just were about 11 episodes into our podcast, which once again, that was just an idea that stemmed a little bit from the pandemic, but you know, it's kind of interesting is that we found that there are so many question marks about the market, right? There's so many things going on, especially during more turbulent times, and we have certainly been in turbulent times for the last three years. And it got to a point where it was almost a little difficult to try and reach everybody at one point in time. So we created the idea of the podcast under the idea that we have so much intel and information we wanted to share with people, and that this was at least a platform that we could try and reach a larger base to tell our people, hey, I can't, I may not be able to get, you know, 2000 people on the phone this month, but I can put these words out there so that they can understand what's going on. And if everyone's freaking out, because the media is on this kick to make everyone really scared that we're on the brink of a housing crisis, well, then we can talk about that. And hopefully I can have a larger span. And it's one of those things that we've been doing enough for, we're coming on a year anniversary. It's been a ton of fun for us. And it's one of those things that it's really, we've got the moment now and we're really excited to see how people are reacting to it. And I can't tell them anytime I see people and they're like, oh my god, thank you so much. Like we didn't want to reach out. We didn't want to bother you. We know how busy you are, but just kind of hearing what you had to say about it really helps us through this time. And once again, they all comes back to that level of compassion and that ability to want to do right in this industry. 100%.
