[00:02:55] You know, when people find out that you and I have this monthly series, I get a lot of,
[00:03:01] ooh, can you ask her this? Can you ask her that? And I think oftentimes what people don't realize
[00:03:09] about someone like yourself who has been in the business for so long is just how much time
[00:03:15] you put into your business. I don't know if you keep an estimate, but if you were to just
[00:03:21] suggest like do you work, are you working five days a week, six days a week, seven days a week,
[00:03:27] what is your typical week sort of look like? It's definitely a seven day a week job for the last 20 years.
[00:03:36] You know, there's no, there's no days off. I mean, it's one of those industries that we are a service,
[00:03:42] you know, we're in service. So it's, you know, people buy homes Monday through Sunday. So it's,
[00:03:48] it doesn't stop. So, but that's a choice, right? I think all REALTORS, I've
[00:03:52] called some brokers and their, their voice mails will say, you know, I don't answer my phone after
[00:03:58] five. Don't expect to call back till tomorrow. You know, again, you run your business, how you want
[00:04:03] to run your business. But, you know, my, my tagline is 100% Kerri. I'm available to you all the time. And,
[00:04:09] you know, it's, it's just, I'm a very innovation person myself. And when I want something or need
[00:04:14] something, I want it to be served right away. It's just that's my personality. And, you know,
[00:04:20] if someone's not going to respond to me, you know, I don't mean like within seconds, but, you know,
[00:04:25] if they don't respond to me promptly, I'll move on. You know, you currently have, and this may even
[00:04:32] not be completely accurate, but I can see at least 50 active listings currently, which is
[00:04:37] incredible 13 are under contract as well. So congratulations there. How easy or challenging,
[00:04:44] it's got to be challenging, is it to manage 50 listings? You know, I've built such a great system,
[00:04:50] you know, a foundation to my business. And I've got an incredible team of people that work with me.
[00:04:58] I have for, I call them like, we'll call them support staff that support my business and my mission.
[00:05:04] And, you know, everything I stand for. And, you know, they do an incredible job. It's definitely
[00:05:09] not something I could do solo by myself, even though I'm a solo agent. You know, I'm the producer
[00:05:15] of the team and the leader of the team, of course, and they support my, my business. So, again,
[00:05:20] without them, I wouldn't be able to do it. So having the right people is important.
[00:05:26] It is, we should also mention to all of our listeners, you win all of your business. So this is not,
[00:05:30] your team is not also helping you get business. So you are the rainmaker, but you are also
[00:05:36] actively involved because it is just really just you out there face to face. So, unbelievable,
[00:05:42] we are always so impressed with everything carried as well. What do we want to talk about today?
[00:05:46] So I thought, you know, we're, you know, headed into the last quarter of 20 or what year? We
[00:05:51] 2024. So, you know, really just kind of thinking about listing presentations because that's the core
[00:05:57] of the business, right? Is listings. Feel it. Everyone has up their game to some degree.
[00:06:05] This year and as our industries change, just, you know, having a lockdown listing,
[00:06:12] presently. And mine always evolves, I will say, you know, I know what works and know what doesn't work.
[00:06:18] But I think, you know, this year, I'm going to change, or for 25, I'm going to change it a little
[00:06:23] bit. So it's kind of reflecting on the process of the listing presentation. And there are some
[00:06:30] very basic things. I called it like the minimum marketing package that every real estate agent
[00:06:38] offers, right? So if you go into a listing presentation and say, you know, I'm going to put a sign
[00:06:43] in your, I'm going to post, I'm going to post an open house. You know, I'm going to take photos,
[00:06:53] you know, like these are things that, I mean, it's kind of, right? That's a standard package
[00:07:00] that every real estate agent should offer. You know, yet I still think a lot of agents go into a
[00:07:06] listing presentation, saying these things, right? So competing against, and sometimes I do, you
[00:07:13] know, they're competing against three to five other agents. Sure. And again, if we all came in
[00:07:19] there and said that same thing, to me, it's not really exciting, right? And so, and again,
[00:07:26] you got to put yourself in the consumer shoes, you know, they don't know. They're like, oh, you're
[00:07:31] going to do an open house. That's great. If I'm number three on the list of coming in, you know,
[00:07:36] they're going to hear the same thing over and over again. It's not going to be that exciting. So,
[00:07:41] I think sharing with a seller, again, you can go through the basics and maybe just let them know.
[00:07:48] This is a very given marketing that we're going to do for you because every agent does that, right?
[00:07:55] But let's talk about why I'm sitting here. And what I'm going to do that's different
[00:08:02] than any other agent, right? Again, we're going to do the signs. Don't worry. We're going to do
[00:08:06] the postcards. We're going to do that. But what am I going to do? And one thing that no other agent
[00:08:12] can compete with is you as a person, right? How hard you're going to work, right? So,
[00:08:17] think about for those of my age and older, you remember the old rolodex, right? That people
[00:08:24] would have on their skin. It had all your contacts in there. You know, last 20 years, I think I built
[00:08:31] an incredible rolodex, if you will, right? And my rolodex doesn't compete with somebody else's
[00:08:39] rolodex. So having built those relationships with people and reputation over the last
[00:08:45] how many years you're in the business is so important, right? Because having those contacts and
[00:08:54] their reputation is so important. But the other thing is social media because that's becoming
[00:08:58] forefront in our industry, right? How we're selling homes. And it's really become a billboard
[00:09:06] of the home now, you know, where photography was so important, right? And people look to the photos.
[00:09:12] But now it's moving. We'll always have photography, but it's moving to video, right? So
[00:09:18] videos expensive, right? And, you know, so I think everyone going into 2025 is going to have to
[00:09:26] put a certain amount aside for their budget for a video. But what video does is it tells the story
[00:09:33] of the home, right? Unlike what a photograph is still and you get one perspective of the home,
[00:09:38] videos and tell that story and how we as brokers communicate and tell the story of that property
[00:09:46] is going to be the engaging part of that and get to the fires, right? I always say I love
[00:09:53] I love the brokers in my community. I don't necessarily need to sell to the brokers in my
[00:09:59] community. Right. It is sell to is the consumer, right? And we we always talked about, you know,
[00:10:05] I'm in Chicago, but you know, selling local real estate. I don't think that's true anymore. I don't
[00:10:10] think this business is super hyper local anymore. I think it has become so national because
[00:10:18] I'm moving. You know, I've the last couple of transactions I've done are people coming in from
[00:10:23] California, someone coming in from Nashville, someone coming in from Boston yesterday, London.
[00:10:28] You know, so I'm seeing people in from all over the place. And so that's why, you know,
[00:10:35] again, when we do our marketing, when we do the videos, I have to speak to the consumer, right?
[00:10:42] Pull them in and it's an emotional transaction, right? Of course, it's a necessity of buying a home.
[00:10:49] You need a home. You need a place to live. But again, it's it's pulling on the emotions of that
[00:10:54] person and also talking about the attributes of the home. How I communicate, how I tell the story,
[00:11:01] what points of the home I'm going to highlight is going to engage that consumer. So I think,
[00:11:08] again, the video is going to be so important to create that video, right? Is where you're
[00:11:15] going to put it? How are you going to communicate that? And this is going back to the listing
[00:11:19] presentation. This is what you need to tell your sellers is, yes, you know, agent ABC, they're going to
[00:11:25] also do videos. But great, what are they going to do with the video? They're producing the video.
[00:11:31] What is their music to their video? How are they articulating your home? How do we,
[00:11:36] you know, come up with the stories of your home? So it's how are you going to be different in that
[00:11:41] capacity? What platforms have you built to put the video on? So, you know, when you talk about
[00:11:46] Instagram at the beginning, YouTube, LinkedIn, you know, all of these platforms have a different
[00:11:52] audience, right? And who's watching? So you need to optimize the videos for those platforms.
[00:11:59] It's not as easy as you think it is, right? I mean, there's a lot of production that goes into this.
[00:12:05] And that's what a seller wants to hear is, again, how are you going to market my property?
[00:12:10] Why is it different? And why should I trust you? And more importantly, why should I have it?
[00:12:16] Yeah, and everybody wants the white glove experience, right? Whether it's a, you know,
[00:12:21] $300,000 starter condo to, you know, mega million dollar single family home,
[00:12:28] these everybody wants to feel like they are getting the Ritz Carlton treatment or the Waldorf
[00:12:34] Astoria treatment. And video is a great way to showcase that. And I, you put a lot of production
[00:12:40] value into your videos. And obviously they have a lot of engagement on social media.
[00:12:47] But also, it's, I would think it would be really cool for a homeowner to see the story of their home
[00:12:54] being played out in a video that you're producing. So you going into a listing presentation,
[00:12:59] say, I want to know the story of this home. I want to hear all about it because I need to sell
[00:13:03] this story to the public. Right. And, and that is a really unique value proposition, right?
[00:13:10] Yeah, we're going to do all the marketing, like you said. We're going to build you a website and,
[00:13:13] you know, we're going to get it all out there. And what I really want to do is have a nice little
[00:13:18] piece that I could fire out to people in social media and in my circles that they can see the
[00:13:24] majesty of this property. Right. And do you ever, I'm curious, have you ever made a video
[00:13:31] before winning a listing? Has that ever happened where you were able to, you know, do do a mock-up or
[00:13:37] or I guess you could just show a previous video? This is what I've done for a similar property in the
[00:13:42] past. And your video starts are so cool. Yeah, no, I'm not. I mean, that's a, that's an interesting
[00:13:49] idea. But I haven't gotten into the house. So, you know, you'd have to fly a drone around the
[00:13:56] property or something. And at that too, it is interesting of just people's privacy and what now.
[00:14:01] Yeah, right. Yeah, a ton of just different examples of videos that I can show to them.
[00:14:08] You know, the other thing I was going to talk to talk about is, is connection with the buying broker.
[00:14:15] So I primarily do a lot of listings, right? And I'm a listing broker. And one thing I think we
[00:14:22] forget about is when a buyer comes into the home, you know, once I'm kind of going off the whole
[00:14:29] listing presentation thing, but once a buyer comes into the home is having a good relationship with
[00:14:34] that buyer's broker. That buyer's broker is so key into the trip, right? He calls. I mean, I have so
[00:14:43] many examples, but I'll just give one recently that the buyer came into the home and the buyer
[00:14:50] loved the home. You know, and that's my opportunity to talk directly to the buyer, right? I don't
[00:14:56] represent the buyer, but now I'm face to face doing the showing. I'm able to, again, communicate the
[00:15:02] value of the home, communicate all the bells and whistles. And watch emotionally how this buyer
[00:15:09] is so connected to this home, right? The agent, um, I'm trying to think how to say it. The
[00:15:21] agent at prior to the listing, the agent asked me about the commission. And I didn't give her a
[00:15:26] straight answer because I didn't know yet what the seller's going to offer. So I think it doesn't
[00:15:31] know how much she's going to get paid. Sure. So during the showing the agents telling the buyer,
[00:15:37] well, I like this other house better for you. And my point in saying this is, you know, I,
[00:15:45] I pulled the agent aside and I just said, um, you know, again, just kind of talking what this is
[00:15:53] about the buyer. This is not about me. This is not about you as an agent. Um, but, you know,
[00:16:00] tell me why you're saying this. Why is the other house better? So we kind of had a side conversation.
[00:16:05] But again, my point in saying this is, winning over a buyer's agent to during these listing
[00:16:10] appointments is key because when they leave the house and I have no more control over that buyer
[00:16:16] or influence in that buyer, that agent is going to be the one right talking to that buyer. So again,
[00:16:22] having good relationships with these brokers, having a professional relationship, if you will,
[00:16:28] is absolutely key in closing the deal. I know we kind of started with the listing appointment,
[00:16:33] but um, having that relationship is important. Also, sorry, I'm kind of rambling, but kind of going
[00:16:40] back to the listing presentation in the videos, a lot of buyers will reach out to me because they
[00:16:44] have seen the video, right? They've seen it on Instagram, Tick-Tock, wherever they've seen it,
[00:16:50] and they'll reach out to me directly and they'll say, oh, I just, you know, tell me about the home
[00:16:54] that you just posted and I tell them and they're like, well, I'm going to have my agent reach out to
[00:16:58] you to schedule a shine. Fantastic. Again, purpose of the video is to reach the consumer,
[00:17:04] get the consumer engaged, have the broker come, you know, along with and my job again is now to
[00:17:10] reassure the broker, you know, again, we got the buyer. Let's work this together, right? And again,
[00:17:16] at the end of the day, we want to make sure that the buyer gets what they want and the seller gets
[00:17:21] what they want and it's a win-win. This is not a battle of pluses brokers. It's creating a win-win
[00:17:28] for everybody. Yeah, I was thinking that, you know, once you've done one of these really nice
[00:17:35] video production, you know, a nice video production for a one of your properties, especially a
[00:17:44] high net worth property, you then can utilize that in all your marketing when you're actually when
[00:17:50] you're meeting with a listing or meeting with a seller, you can also, you know, really begin to
[00:17:56] share all of that information. So I think going back to like, how do we differentiate ourselves?
[00:18:02] I heard a couple of things. One is, yes, we're going to do all the things that all the other agents
[00:18:07] do and we're going to really sell the home on what's specific about the home, what's unique about
[00:18:13] the home, how do we reach the consumer and also how do we reach the agents who represent those
[00:18:20] consumers and it seems like there's just a lot of activity there and I think for especially
[00:18:28] higher priced properties, you do have to sort of find the buyer as the listing agent, right?
[00:18:34] Or you at least have to know who the brokers are in the area, the agents in the area, who represent
[00:18:39] people of those high net worth means and those are the ones you kind of have to win over. Is that accurate?
[00:18:45] 100%. You know, and again, everyone wants a smooth transaction. So being able to, you know,
[00:18:52] just focus on the buyers, my number one thing is finding the buyers, right? If they have a broker
[00:18:57] fantastic, you know, I want to work with that and collaborate of course with the brokers.
[00:19:01] But having a good reputation in the marketplace and again, I've been doing this for so long,
[00:19:07] you know, hopefully if you pulled 50 brokers and asked about my name, you know,
[00:19:13] 49 would probably say, you know, I'm a nice person, you know, and I try to be, there's always the one
[00:19:19] that says, you know, but you know, that you have to have a good reputation in your marketplace to
[00:19:24] get things done. Yeah, I like the idea of really differentiating yourself and playing nice in
[00:19:30] the sandbox and realizing that, you know, listings come and go and clients come and go and sometimes
[00:19:37] you end up on the winning side of it and sometimes you don't. And also just sort of shaking yourself off,
[00:19:42] I often think that's really successful agents like yourself probably fail more than the average
[00:19:50] agent because you do so much activity that people see your successes and I don't mean failure as
[00:19:56] in a bad way. I just mean things don't always fall your way. And I bet you actually probably lose
[00:20:03] more listings than the average agent because you're willing to put yourself out there. And it's also
[00:20:08] the reason why you have 50 listings right now is because you're doing a lot of listing. I don't think
[00:20:12] most, most agents, you know, have 20 listing appointments per month if they do great, but carry
[00:20:20] does. And so she's constantly out there doing it. I always heard this expression, even if you don't
[00:20:25] improve any part of your technique or your skill set, if you just double your activity and theory,
[00:20:30] you should be able to double your production, right? So, and of course, of course, you want to get
[00:20:35] better. But I think there's a misnomer that somebody like yourself just everything falls your way,
[00:20:41] you just win everything, no, you're working seven days a week, you are on top of it to a degree
[00:20:46] that I've never seen another agent. And you have to be because of the demands of this job. And as a result,
[00:20:53] the rewards are amazing, but it does not, it, there's probably easier ways to make money. I'm guessing
[00:20:59] if you really wanted to. But I will say I really am obsessed with my job. I, I really live and breathe
[00:21:06] what I do. And it's important to me, you know, it's, it's not about always about the numbers. And I
[00:21:14] think that's kind of where to when I let go of, I'm just trying to say this, when I let go of like
[00:21:21] wanting to be at the top or when I let go of like, you know, the numbers. And I know that's kind
[00:21:27] of hard to say, but when you really focus on what is really important, which is doing an incredible job,
[00:21:33] providing service, you know, clients getting the homes that they want, doing the right thing,
[00:21:37] it really just kind of, it comes, it, it comes to you, right? So, but it is still, it's a lot of hard work.
[00:21:44] And yes, it's, you know, it's, it's, I, we win some and we lose some. So.
[00:21:51] Yeah, it's the amount of activity you do is, is truly, truly remarkable. I mean, just today,
[00:21:58] how much, how, how many clients are you reaching out to? Or are you working with just today alone?
[00:22:04] Just out of curiosity, how many appointments? I know you must have a bunch.
[00:22:08] Well, I do have a time block this afternoon that I'm going to reach out to all of my current clients,
[00:22:12] just give like a little market update my afternoon. But I'm, it's, it's not a lot of work for me,
[00:22:19] just because I know the market so well and what's moving and what's not moving. Because again,
[00:22:23] it's just, it's studying. It's, this goes to school, right? Like it's every day I study the market to see
[00:22:28] what's selling, what's not selling. I talk to brokers at my, you know, I'm in the field, so I hear it,
[00:22:34] I feel it. So it's easy for me to communicate that to them. You know, but sometimes I have to
[00:22:41] communicate bad news to people. And I have that call this morning with somebody. It's, you know,
[00:22:46] and one of my clients, and I always learn from all of my clients too, because, you know, especially,
[00:22:54] you know, everyone's successful in the field. So I always learn, you know, I sit down with a client,
[00:22:58] but he was or is a financial advisor, a very, very, very successful financial advisor. And what he said
[00:23:05] to me in a very stern voice was, tell me the truth and tell me what, tell me the number that it is,
[00:23:13] even if you think I don't want to hear it, because I need to make a decision. And I cannot make a
[00:23:18] decision if I don't have accurate numbers. And you think about that with a doctor. If you go to a
[00:23:23] doctor and say, what's this bump and you, or, you know, what is this on my hand? And they'd want to
[00:23:29] quote it and say, oh, it's nothing. Then you make a decision based on that doctor saying it's
[00:23:34] nothing. But if the doctor tells you the truth of what this is, and then react and do something
[00:23:41] accordingly to make the right decision. So, you know, there's a lot of agents where the, and,
[00:23:47] you know, I've fallen into this category too, where you're just like, you know, that they want to
[00:23:50] hear a certain number, you know, and you tell them that, and they've got all these hopes up,
[00:23:55] and then it just, it's, it, it fails, right? Because you weren't truthful. So, I had to have that
[00:24:00] call this morning, again, this other gentleman's a financial advisor as well. And I told them that.
[00:24:05] I said, you know, my job is to tell you the, you know, the facts, you know, and this is a conversation
[00:24:11] between you and I. This is, this is the fact of where your property sits in the market and where
[00:24:16] it's going to trade. You know, you now have a choice. Either we move forward with that number,
[00:24:20] or you hold it until you're ready to, you know, face the music basically, or run it, or, you know,
[00:24:27] hear some other options for you. And he was mad. He was really mad, but at the end of the conversation,
[00:24:34] you know, it ended very nicely where he said, thank you. He's like, you know, let me think about it,
[00:24:38] but you're right. I mean, this is, you're showing me, not only it's me giving the numbers, but it's,
[00:24:43] here's the data to support that, you know, and it's not a fun conversation to have.
[00:24:49] No, and the anger isn't towards you. It's just anger at the information. Oh, I wish it was higher.
[00:24:54] I wish I could sell it for more. Everybody wants that. Sure. And everybody's, you know,
[00:24:59] wants to sell their home for a profit. And we all want to hear a number that is psychologically
[00:25:05] satisfying to us. And we also need to know the truth. And especially really successful people,
[00:25:10] I think they, they may react to the news and also appreciate the fact that you're confident enough
[00:25:17] and willing to tell them what they might not want to hear. And probably that separates you from
[00:25:24] a lot of agents just enough itself. Well, that's where sometimes I lose the deal though, you know,
[00:25:29] or I'll lose the listing because they don't want to hear it. So, you know, but it's, you know, I know,
[00:25:36] you know, well, I, you know, we do. Yeah, I don't, and those, those listings are tough when you
[00:25:44] lose them because you don't have the same number in mind that they have in mind. And you'd be fighting
[00:25:50] that battle the entire process most likely, right? So you, you're confident in your skill set. And
[00:25:57] the good news is lots of people seem to want to work with you because of how confident you are
[00:26:03] on your numbers. It's not just I have this great awesome video production company that I work with.
[00:26:08] But it does help to have these sort of assets, these digital assets that you can say, this is
[00:26:14] what I do for my clients. And I love the idea of the story selling approach. I going all the way
[00:26:19] back to that first idea of tell me the story of this home. Why did you buy it? What's unique about it?
[00:26:25] Tell me the cool stuff about it because I'm going to feature that and I'm going to get this out
[00:26:29] in the world. And I've been, you know, what I really want to do is anyone can find this home on
[00:26:34] Zelo anyone can find it on Redfin or any of the other client facing websites. And I still need to go
[00:26:40] out and find the buyer. And I'm going to do it throughout all these different channels. And we're
[00:26:43] going to do it in the unique way. And that's it's it's kind of there's a little bit of a Hollywood
[00:26:48] component too. Like I want to see the cool video of my condo. I want to see that, right? And I love
[00:26:54] that people are so into their job like you that you're like, no, we're going to do this. This is
[00:26:59] fun. This is exciting. We're going to do this. And it is fun and exciting and it does help. So
[00:27:05] I think yeah, just being different be do more. I guess is probably the end of the
[00:27:11] really the bottom line is just be willing to do more than the average agent. And you know,
[00:27:17] and again, everybody likes people love when they feel understood and they feel you know,
[00:27:25] and I think to like the age, I think most people want to hear the truth. And I think agents,
[00:27:31] you know, would do themselves a favor by saying you're probably not going to always like the news.
[00:27:36] I'm going to share with you. You're certainly not. There's going to be a time when I'm going to
[00:27:39] share something with you that's true. You're not going to like it. And we're going to get through
[00:27:43] it. I promise we're going to get through it. It's part of the deal. Every transaction has one of
[00:27:47] those moments. And just prepping people in advance. And I know you are exceptionally good at that.
[00:27:52] And anyway, we should just tell everybody for Carrie's been on our show now for five or six,
[00:27:58] I think six years. We appreciate her. We love her. She does not have time to do this guy. She has
[00:28:03] 50 active listings of no team. I wish I can be with you all day. I wish I could, I want to see,
[00:28:09] I want to see what you do all day. And also to remember that everybody, every con communication
[00:28:15] you have with another agent is remembered. So remember if you're texting, if you're emailing,
[00:28:21] if you're not doing it, voice to voice, before you hit that send, think about if I was the other
[00:28:27] agent, how might I interpret this? Is my communication going to be if received effectively,
[00:28:35] or do I need to change some words around to make it seem more pleasant or more friendly?
[00:28:41] Chat GBT is very good at this. So if you have to deliver bad news, you could throw it in there,
[00:28:45] say, you know, maybe make it a little bit friendlier. But this is really important because people
[00:28:50] remember those little interactions. Everybody remembers the interactions they've had with the
[00:28:54] agents they don't like. And they stay, they sort of stain and stick around. So be nice to everyone,
[00:29:03] especially now, it's harder than ever right now to sort of do everything. So let's be nice to
[00:29:09] each other and work together. Carrie, if anyone out there would like to work with you or maybe they
[00:29:16] have clients that are moving to the Chicago and area that you could help, what would be the
[00:29:21] best way that another agent could reach out to say, hey, I want to send some business over to you.
[00:29:25] I always love phone calls because again, just like the cadence of conversation in tone of their voice,
[00:29:31] you know, I always love just to chat with people. So I always say call me 312-9614-612. But emails
[00:29:38] just as easy or texting is just as easy as well. And if you want to congratulate Carrie, she's
[00:29:44] on pace to have her best year ever. We'll see what happens again, you know, whatever happens
[00:29:50] happens by the end of the year. But she is doing exceptionally well again and possibly having her
[00:29:56] very best year ever. And this is not an easy year to have your best year ever. So congratulations to

You know, when people find out that you and I have this monthly series, I get a lot of, ooh, can you ask her this? Can you ask her that? And I think oftentimes what people don't realize about someone like yourself who has been in the business for so long is just how much time you put into your business. I don't know if you keep an estimate, but if you were to just suggest like do you work, are you working five days a week, six days a week, seven days a week, what is your typical week sort of look like? It's definitely a seven day a week job for the last 20 years. You know, there's no, there's no days off. I mean, it's one of those industries that we are a service, you know, we're in service. So it's, you know, people buy homes Monday through Sunday. So it's, it doesn't stop. So, but that's a choice, right? I think all REALTORS, I've called some brokers and their, their voice mails will say, you know, I don't answer my phone after five. Don't expect to call back till tomorrow. You know, again, you run your business, how you want to run your business. But, you know, my, my tagline is 100% Kerri. I'm available to you all the time. And, you know, it's, it's just, I'm a very innovation person myself. And when I want something or need something, I want it to be served right away. It's just that's my personality. And, you know, if someone's not going to respond to me, you know, I don't mean like within seconds, but, you know, if they don't respond to me promptly, I'll move on. You know, you currently have, and this may even not be completely accurate, but I can see at least 50 active listings currently, which is incredible 13 are under contract as well. So congratulations there. How easy or challenging, it's got to be challenging, is it to manage 50 listings? You know, I've built such a great system, you know, a foundation to my business. And I've got an incredible team of people that work with me. I have for, I call them like, we'll call them support staff that support my business and my mission. And, you know, everything I stand for. And, you know, they do an incredible job. It's definitely not something I could do solo by myself, even though I'm a solo agent. You know, I'm the producer of the team and the leader of the team, of course, and they support my, my business. So, again, without them, I wouldn't be able to do it. So having the right people is important. It is, we should also mention to all of our listeners, you win all of your business. So this is not, your team is not also helping you get business. So you are the rainmaker, but you are also actively involved because it is just really just you out there face to face. So, unbelievable, we are always so impressed with everything carried as well. What do we want to talk about today? So I thought, you know, we're, you know, headed into the last quarter of 20 or what year? We 2024. So, you know, really just kind of thinking about listing presentations because that's the core of the business, right? Is listings. Feel it. Everyone has up their game to some degree. This year and as our industries change, just, you know, having a lockdown listing, presently. And mine always evolves, I will say, you know, I know what works and know what doesn't work. But I think, you know, this year, I'm going to change, or for 25, I'm going to change it a little bit. So it's kind of reflecting on the process of the listing presentation. And there are some very basic things. I called it like the minimum marketing package that every real estate agent offers, right? So if you go into a listing presentation and say, you know, I'm going to put a sign in your, I'm going to post, I'm going to post an open house. You know, I'm going to take photos, you know, like these are things that, I mean, it's kind of, right? That's a standard package that every real estate agent should offer. You know, yet I still think a lot of agents go into a listing presentation, saying these things, right? So competing against, and sometimes I do, you know, they're competing against three to five other agents. Sure. And again, if we all came in there and said that same thing, to me, it's not really exciting, right? And so, and again, you got to put yourself in the consumer shoes, you know, they don't know. They're like, oh, you're going to do an open house. That's great. If I'm number three on the list of coming in, you know, they're going to hear the same thing over and over again. It's not going to be that exciting. So, I think sharing with a seller, again, you can go through the basics and maybe just let them know. This is a very given marketing that we're going to do for you because every agent does that, right? But let's talk about why I'm sitting here. And what I'm going to do that's different than any other agent, right? Again, we're going to do the signs. Don't worry. We're going to do the postcards. We're going to do that. But what am I going to do? And one thing that no other agent can compete with is you as a person, right? How hard you're going to work, right? So, think about for those of my age and older, you remember the old rolodex, right? That people would have on their skin. It had all your contacts in there. You know, last 20 years, I think I built an incredible rolodex, if you will, right? And my rolodex doesn't compete with somebody else's rolodex. So having built those relationships with people and reputation over the last how many years you're in the business is so important, right? Because having those contacts and their reputation is so important. But the other thing is social media because that's becoming forefront in our industry, right? How we're selling homes. And it's really become a billboard of the home now, you know, where photography was so important, right? And people look to the photos. But now it's moving. We'll always have photography, but it's moving to video, right? So videos expensive, right? And, you know, so I think everyone going into 2025 is going to have to put a certain amount aside for their budget for a video. But what video does is it tells the story of the home, right? Unlike what a photograph is still and you get one perspective of the home, videos and tell that story and how we as brokers communicate and tell the story of that property is going to be the engaging part of that and get to the fires, right? I always say I love I love the brokers in my community. I don't necessarily need to sell to the brokers in my community. Right. It is sell to is the consumer, right? And we we always talked about, you know, I'm in Chicago, but you know, selling local real estate. I don't think that's true anymore. I don't think this business is super hyper local anymore. I think it has become so national because I'm moving. You know, I've the last couple of transactions I've done are people coming in from California, someone coming in from Nashville, someone coming in from Boston yesterday, London. You know, so I'm seeing people in from all over the place. And so that's why, you know, again, when we do our marketing, when we do the videos, I have to speak to the consumer, right? Pull them in and it's an emotional transaction, right? Of course, it's a necessity of buying a home. You need a home. You need a place to live. But again, it's it's pulling on the emotions of that person and also talking about the attributes of the home. How I communicate, how I tell the story, what points of the home I'm going to highlight is going to engage that consumer. So I think, again, the video is going to be so important to create that video, right? Is where you're going to put it? How are you going to communicate that? And this is going back to the listing presentation. This is what you need to tell your sellers is, yes, you know, agent ABC, they're going to also do videos. But great, what are they going to do with the video? They're producing the video. What is their music to their video? How are they articulating your home? How do we, you know, come up with the stories of your home? So it's how are you going to be different in that capacity? What platforms have you built to put the video on? So, you know, when you talk about Instagram at the beginning, YouTube, LinkedIn, you know, all of these platforms have a different audience, right? And who's watching? So you need to optimize the videos for those platforms. It's not as easy as you think it is, right? I mean, there's a lot of production that goes into this. And that's what a seller wants to hear is, again, how are you going to market my property? Why is it different? And why should I trust you? And more importantly, why should I have it? Yeah, and everybody wants the white glove experience, right? Whether it's a, you know, $300,000 starter condo to, you know, mega million dollar single family home, these everybody wants to feel like they are getting the Ritz Carlton treatment or the Waldorf Astoria treatment. And video is a great way to showcase that. And I, you put a lot of production value into your videos. And obviously they have a lot of engagement on social media. But also, it's, I would think it would be really cool for a homeowner to see the story of their home being played out in a video that you're producing. So you going into a listing presentation, say, I want to know the story of this home. I want to hear all about it because I need to sell this story to the public. Right. And, and that is a really unique value proposition, right? Yeah, we're going to do all the marketing, like you said. We're going to build you a website and, you know, we're going to get it all out there. And what I really want to do is have a nice little piece that I could fire out to people in social media and in my circles that they can see the majesty of this property. Right. And do you ever, I'm curious, have you ever made a video before winning a listing? Has that ever happened where you were able to, you know, do do a mock-up or or I guess you could just show a previous video? This is what I've done for a similar property in the past. And your video starts are so cool. Yeah, no, I'm not. I mean, that's a, that's an interesting idea. But I haven't gotten into the house. So, you know, you'd have to fly a drone around the property or something. And at that too, it is interesting of just people's privacy and what now. Yeah, right. Yeah, a ton of just different examples of videos that I can show to them. You know, the other thing I was going to talk to talk about is, is connection with the buying broker. So I primarily do a lot of listings, right? And I'm a listing broker. And one thing I think we forget about is when a buyer comes into the home, you know, once I'm kind of going off the whole listing presentation thing, but once a buyer comes into the home is having a good relationship with that buyer's broker. That buyer's broker is so key into the trip, right? He calls. I mean, I have so many examples, but I'll just give one recently that the buyer came into the home and the buyer loved the home. You know, and that's my opportunity to talk directly to the buyer, right? I don't represent the buyer, but now I'm face to face doing the showing. I'm able to, again, communicate the value of the home, communicate all the bells and whistles. And watch emotionally how this buyer is so connected to this home, right? The agent, um, I'm trying to think how to say it. The agent at prior to the listing, the agent asked me about the commission. And I didn't give her a straight answer because I didn't know yet what the seller's going to offer. So I think it doesn't know how much she's going to get paid. Sure. So during the showing the agents telling the buyer, well, I like this other house better for you. And my point in saying this is, you know, I, I pulled the agent aside and I just said, um, you know, again, just kind of talking what this is about the buyer. This is not about me. This is not about you as an agent. Um, but, you know, tell me why you're saying this. Why is the other house better? So we kind of had a side conversation. But again, my point in saying this is, winning over a buyer's agent to during these listing appointments is key because when they leave the house and I have no more control over that buyer or influence in that buyer, that agent is going to be the one right talking to that buyer. So again, having good relationships with these brokers, having a professional relationship, if you will, is absolutely key in closing the deal. I know we kind of started with the listing appointment, but um, having that relationship is important. Also, sorry, I'm kind of rambling, but kind of going back to the listing presentation in the videos, a lot of buyers will reach out to me because they have seen the video, right? They've seen it on Instagram, Tick-Tock, wherever they've seen it, and they'll reach out to me directly and they'll say, oh, I just, you know, tell me about the home that you just posted and I tell them and they're like, well, I'm going to have my agent reach out to you to schedule a shine. Fantastic. Again, purpose of the video is to reach the consumer, get the consumer engaged, have the broker come, you know, along with and my job again is now to reassure the broker, you know, again, we got the buyer. Let's work this together, right? And again, at the end of the day, we want to make sure that the buyer gets what they want and the seller gets what they want and it's a win-win. This is not a battle of pluses brokers. It's creating a win-win for everybody. Yeah, I was thinking that, you know, once you've done one of these really nice video production, you know, a nice video production for a one of your properties, especially a high net worth property, you then can utilize that in all your marketing when you're actually when you're meeting with a listing or meeting with a seller, you can also, you know, really begin to share all of that information. So I think going back to like, how do we differentiate ourselves? I heard a couple of things. One is, yes, we're going to do all the things that all the other agents do and we're going to really sell the home on what's specific about the home, what's unique about the home, how do we reach the consumer and also how do we reach the agents who represent those consumers and it seems like there's just a lot of activity there and I think for especially higher priced properties, you do have to sort of find the buyer as the listing agent, right? Or you at least have to know who the brokers are in the area, the agents in the area, who represent people of those high net worth means and those are the ones you kind of have to win over. Is that accurate? 100%. You know, and again, everyone wants a smooth transaction. So being able to, you know, just focus on the buyers, my number one thing is finding the buyers, right? If they have a broker fantastic, you know, I want to work with that and collaborate of course with the brokers. But having a good reputation in the marketplace and again, I've been doing this for so long, you know, hopefully if you pulled 50 brokers and asked about my name, you know, 49 would probably say, you know, I'm a nice person, you know, and I try to be, there's always the one that says, you know, but you know, that you have to have a good reputation in your marketplace to get things done. Yeah, I like the idea of really differentiating yourself and playing nice in the sandbox and realizing that, you know, listings come and go and clients come and go and sometimes you end up on the winning side of it and sometimes you don't. And also just sort of shaking yourself off, I often think that's really successful agents like yourself probably fail more than the average agent because you do so much activity that people see your successes and I don't mean failure as in a bad way. I just mean things don't always fall your way. And I bet you actually probably lose more listings than the average agent because you're willing to put yourself out there. And it's also the reason why you have 50 listings right now is because you're doing a lot of listing. I don't think most, most agents, you know, have 20 listing appointments per month if they do great, but carry does. And so she's constantly out there doing it. I always heard this expression, even if you don't improve any part of your technique or your skill set, if you just double your activity and theory, you should be able to double your production, right? So, and of course, of course, you want to get better. But I think there's a misnomer that somebody like yourself just everything falls your way, you just win everything, no, you're working seven days a week, you are on top of it to a degree that I've never seen another agent. And you have to be because of the demands of this job. And as a result, the rewards are amazing, but it does not, it, there's probably easier ways to make money. I'm guessing if you really wanted to. But I will say I really am obsessed with my job. I, I really live and breathe what I do. And it's important to me, you know, it's, it's not about always about the numbers. And I think that's kind of where to when I let go of, I'm just trying to say this, when I let go of like wanting to be at the top or when I let go of like, you know, the numbers. And I know that's kind of hard to say, but when you really focus on what is really important, which is doing an incredible job, providing service, you know, clients getting the homes that they want, doing the right thing, it really just kind of, it comes, it, it comes to you, right? So, but it is still, it's a lot of hard work. And yes, it's, you know, it's, it's, I, we win some and we lose some. So. Yeah, it's the amount of activity you do is, is truly, truly remarkable. I mean, just today, how much, how, how many clients are you reaching out to? Or are you working with just today alone? Just out of curiosity, how many appointments? I know you must have a bunch. Well, I do have a time block this afternoon that I'm going to reach out to all of my current clients, just give like a little market update my afternoon. But I'm, it's, it's not a lot of work for me, just because I know the market so well and what's moving and what's not moving. Because again, it's just, it's studying. It's, this goes to school, right? Like it's every day I study the market to see what's selling, what's not selling. I talk to brokers at my, you know, I'm in the field, so I hear it, I feel it. So it's easy for me to communicate that to them. You know, but sometimes I have to communicate bad news to people. And I have that call this morning with somebody. It's, you know, and one of my clients, and I always learn from all of my clients too, because, you know, especially, you know, everyone's successful in the field. So I always learn, you know, I sit down with a client, but he was or is a financial advisor, a very, very, very successful financial advisor. And what he said to me in a very stern voice was, tell me the truth and tell me what, tell me the number that it is, even if you think I don't want to hear it, because I need to make a decision. And I cannot make a decision if I don't have accurate numbers. And you think about that with a doctor. If you go to a doctor and say, what's this bump and you, or, you know, what is this on my hand? And they'd want to quote it and say, oh, it's nothing. Then you make a decision based on that doctor saying it's nothing. But if the doctor tells you the truth of what this is, and then react and do something accordingly to make the right decision. So, you know, there's a lot of agents where the, and, you know, I've fallen into this category too, where you're just like, you know, that they want to hear a certain number, you know, and you tell them that, and they've got all these hopes up, and then it just, it's, it, it fails, right? Because you weren't truthful. So, I had to have that call this morning, again, this other gentleman's a financial advisor as well. And I told them that. I said, you know, my job is to tell you the, you know, the facts, you know, and this is a conversation between you and I. This is, this is the fact of where your property sits in the market and where it's going to trade. You know, you now have a choice. Either we move forward with that number, or you hold it until you're ready to, you know, face the music basically, or run it, or, you know, hear some other options for you. And he was mad. He was really mad, but at the end of the conversation, you know, it ended very nicely where he said, thank you. He's like, you know, let me think about it, but you're right. I mean, this is, you're showing me, not only it's me giving the numbers, but it's, here's the data to support that, you know, and it's not a fun conversation to have. No, and the anger isn't towards you. It's just anger at the information. Oh, I wish it was higher. I wish I could sell it for more. Everybody wants that. Sure. And everybody's, you know, wants to sell their home for a profit. And we all want to hear a number that is psychologically satisfying to us. And we also need to know the truth. And especially really successful people, I think they, they may react to the news and also appreciate the fact that you're confident enough and willing to tell them what they might not want to hear. And probably that separates you from a lot of agents just enough itself. Well, that's where sometimes I lose the deal though, you know, or I'll lose the listing because they don't want to hear it. So, you know, but it's, you know, I know, you know, well, I, you know, we do. Yeah, I don't, and those, those listings are tough when you lose them because you don't have the same number in mind that they have in mind. And you'd be fighting that battle the entire process most likely, right? So you, you're confident in your skill set. And the good news is lots of people seem to want to work with you because of how confident you are on your numbers. It's not just I have this great awesome video production company that I work with. But it does help to have these sort of assets, these digital assets that you can say, this is what I do for my clients. And I love the idea of the story selling approach. I going all the way back to that first idea of tell me the story of this home. Why did you buy it? What's unique about it? Tell me the cool stuff about it because I'm going to feature that and I'm going to get this out in the world. And I've been, you know, what I really want to do is anyone can find this home on Zelo anyone can find it on Redfin or any of the other client facing websites. And I still need to go out and find the buyer. And I'm going to do it throughout all these different channels. And we're going to do it in the unique way. And that's it's it's kind of there's a little bit of a Hollywood component too. Like I want to see the cool video of my condo. I want to see that, right? And I love that people are so into their job like you that you're like, no, we're going to do this. This is fun. This is exciting. We're going to do this. And it is fun and exciting and it does help. So I think yeah, just being different be do more. I guess is probably the end of the really the bottom line is just be willing to do more than the average agent. And you know, and again, everybody likes people love when they feel understood and they feel you know, and I think to like the age, I think most people want to hear the truth. And I think agents, you know, would do themselves a favor by saying you're probably not going to always like the news. I'm going to share with you. You're certainly not. There's going to be a time when I'm going to share something with you that's true. You're not going to like it. And we're going to get through it. I promise we're going to get through it. It's part of the deal. Every transaction has one of those moments. And just prepping people in advance. And I know you are exceptionally good at that. And anyway, we should just tell everybody for Carrie's been on our show now for five or six, I think six years. We appreciate her. We love her. She does not have time to do this guy. She has 50 active listings of no team. I wish I can be with you all day. I wish I could, I want to see, I want to see what you do all day. And also to remember that everybody, every con communication you have with another agent is remembered. So remember if you're texting, if you're emailing, if you're not doing it, voice to voice, before you hit that send, think about if I was the other agent, how might I interpret this? Is my communication going to be if received effectively, or do I need to change some words around to make it seem more pleasant or more friendly? Chat GBT is very good at this. So if you have to deliver bad news, you could throw it in there, say, you know, maybe make it a little bit friendlier. But this is really important because people remember those little interactions. Everybody remembers the interactions they've had with the agents they don't like. And they stay, they sort of stain and stick around. So be nice to everyone, especially now, it's harder than ever right now to sort of do everything. So let's be nice to each other and work together. Carrie, if anyone out there would like to work with you or maybe they have clients that are moving to the Chicago and area that you could help, what would be the best way that another agent could reach out to say, hey, I want to send some business over to you. I always love phone calls because again, just like the cadence of conversation in tone of their voice, you know, I always love just to chat with people. So I always say call me 312-9614-612. But emails just as easy or texting is just as easy as well. And if you want to congratulate Carrie, she's on pace to have her best year ever. We'll see what happens again, you know, whatever happens happens by the end of the year. But she is doing exceptionally well again and possibly having her very best year ever.
