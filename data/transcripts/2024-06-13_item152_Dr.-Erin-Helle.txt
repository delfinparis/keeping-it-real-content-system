[00:02:17] Hey guys, Erin Helle here with the Grow with Me series. We talk about business, wealth, and health.
[00:02:23] And today we are going to talk about figuring out your income goal as a REALTOR.
[00:02:28] Okay, so before we dive into it, let's recap our last episode. Last time we talked about
[00:02:33] social media and building a content calendar with 16 minutes, a 60 minute time block.
[00:02:40] So hopefully you guys did that. Hopefully you feel really good about that system and you can
[00:02:45] create a process that you can carry going forward and be really productive with your social media
[00:02:49] management. And hopefully all the work that you did before that to figure out your vision and
[00:02:54] your mission statement and what you're about as a REALTOR and even as a person. Hopefully all of
[00:03:01] that will help you with your content and make you really productive and really hyper focused.
[00:03:07] And again, make sure that you're focusing that time and time blocking it, keeping it protected
[00:03:13] on your calendar, being productive with it. And hopefully you'll start to do those things
[00:03:18] that same process with other things in your business too. Okay, so that's just a recap.
[00:03:24] Today again, we are going to talk about your income goal as a REALTOR. I think that the hardest
[00:03:32] part about being a REALTOR or about being self-employed is figuring out how to stay motivated.
[00:03:40] You know, that motivation is the hardest part. But I've found two ways to keep that motivation going
[00:03:48] constantly and consistently. When especially when you're feeling depressed, you have an
[00:03:53] rough day. Maybe you just came back from a vacation and the last thing you want to do is work.
[00:03:58] The things that help me sort of stay motivated and keep moving forward, putting one step in front
[00:04:04] of the other are goal setting and accountability. We're going to talk a lot about goal setting in
[00:04:11] the session, but let's talk briefly about accountability because I think this is super, super important.
[00:04:16] I think it's important that you surround yourself with people who are on the same path as you,
[00:04:21] on the same trajectory as you. Doesn't mean that they have to be have the same goals. It just means
[00:04:27] that they have to be working toward increasing their revenue, bettering themselves, improving their
[00:04:32] business if that's what you want to do. And it's going to be that much easier for you to level up
[00:04:38] and keep scaling your business when you're surrounded by all the people that are doing those things.
[00:04:44] Okay, there's so many quotes out there about how you are the product of the people you spend the
[00:04:48] most time with. And that is absolutely accurate. So keep that in mind. And that's why I joined my
[00:04:55] team at eXp because we're actually not a team or community. I didn't really want to give up my
[00:05:01] commission. I wasn't interested in a team split, but I needed a community. And that's what we have
[00:05:06] at five pillars. So there's no team split, but we collaborate, we coordinate, we share things,
[00:05:12] we have tons of training, and we all do it together. And that has made the biggest difference in my
[00:05:18] business. Okay, so that's the accountability piece. If you need to talk more about it, as always,
[00:05:23] reach out to me. Send me an email, erin.m.helle at gmail.com. Find me on Instagram at the erin.helle
[00:05:33] underscore investor coach. I'll be there. I'll be ready to receive your question, your input,
[00:05:38] whatever it is. Okay, so let's get into the goal setting piece of this. So it's easy to come up with
[00:05:45] an income goal, right? It's easy to say, I want to make 12 grand a month. I want to make 20 grand a
[00:05:50] month. But if that's not grounded in anything, if that's not based on anything, it's probably not
[00:05:57] going to be very motivating. If you figure out what that number is for and about and what it does
[00:06:04] for you, it's going to be that much more powerful. And I know you guys have heard me say this before.
[00:06:10] If it doesn't light your soul on fire, you got to go back and do it again. Okay, so when you're
[00:06:15] going through this exercise to create this income goal, your motivations need to light your soul
[00:06:21] on fire. And that's what's going to allow you to be successful. And again, stay motivated in pursuit
[00:06:28] of these goals. So let's start with take out a clean piece of paper or an Excel sheet, whatever you
[00:06:35] want to do, however you work, you can just do notes in your phone as well. And write down your monthly
[00:06:41] expenses, all of your needs, the things you need to pay for first and foremost every single month.
[00:06:47] These things are going to be like your rent payment or your mortgage payment, your utility bills,
[00:06:52] it's going to be your groceries, anything that you have to pay for, maybe you have to pay for
[00:06:57] lawn care, you have to pay for an HOA, whatever it is, write it down, write down what it is, and write
[00:07:02] down how much it costs. Every single little thing, gas, electric, water, your lunch expenses, if you
[00:07:11] go out to eat during the week or entertainment, well actually we'll get into wants in a second.
[00:07:17] So this is just your needs. So your groceries, again utilities, anything you have to pay for every
[00:07:26] single month, maybe you have a car payment, maybe you have a student loan, you have to pay off,
[00:07:31] maybe you have some credit card debt you're working to pay down, make sure that you list all of
[00:07:36] those things in there. Once you have all your needs written down, you can shift over to your wants.
[00:07:42] And here you want to think about travel expenses, entertainment expenses, you want to think about
[00:07:49] the things that you want to do, maybe you want to buy a new movie on Hulu every month or a new
[00:08:01] put that number in there, what that cost associated with that thing is. So think dining out, think
[00:08:11] going to the movies, going to theater, whatever it is that you want to do, write it down with a
[00:08:17] dollar amount associated with each thing. Then after that, think about how much money you'd like to
[00:08:24] save every single month and put a dollar amount to that and then a separate account for a separate
[00:08:33] amount for how much you want to invest every month. These two can might be different, they may be
[00:08:42] the same. The way I do it is I save till a certain amount and then I invest whatever is over that
[00:08:47] amount constantly, constantly investing, but the evening is in a good place first. I want to have
[00:08:54] my reserve where I want it to be and where I can feel comfortable and where I can sleep well at night
[00:08:58] without stressing about a rainy day or something happening to my car or whatever. So these are
[00:09:06] personal, they're not, I can't give you a hard and fast rule, like you should save this much money,
[00:09:11] you should invest this much money, you should have this much money in reserve. That's important for
[00:09:15] you to know and it's going to take some fine tuning and some tweaking and some experience frankly
[00:09:20] to figure out what those numbers are. So here's just the baseline and so you can get really,
[00:09:27] really aggressive in terms of your wants. Like I want to go to Disney World twice a year.
[00:09:33] That's probably $20,000 worth of travel expenses or you can say like I'm willing to sacrifice
[00:09:40] my vacations for the next two years in pursuit of my goals. So your monthly amount that you need is
[00:09:48] going to be a lot lower. It doesn't really matter. It matters is that you are disciplined and you
[00:09:55] stick to this plan that you're laying out and you stick to these costs and expenses and you avoid
[00:10:00] that lifestyle creep that's going to be associated with making more money because if you can do that
[00:10:07] and you cannot like get a nicer house, get a nicer rental every time you sort of level up,
[00:10:12] then you're opening yourself up to being able to do more things and that's where financial freedom
[00:10:18] comes in. People think that I've heard people say like financial freedom is a farce, it doesn't
[00:10:24] really exist. I don't necessarily agree with that. I do agree that income isn't typically passive.
[00:10:32] You do have to work for your money. You do have to work to invest your money into generate
[00:10:38] returns so that you can achieve a higher amount of freedom and have more freedom as a result.
[00:10:45] But I do think to me financial freedom means being able to travel whenever I want, whenever
[00:10:51] my kids are off of school, whenever my husband can get off and even more than that. And also do not
[00:10:57] have to be limited. Like if someone comes to me and they have a need, they need help with something.
[00:11:04] I want to be able to say yes and not be limited in that, whether it's a home cooked meal or it's a
[00:11:11] a friend of mine just ended up fostering two twin babies and she was like the formula is
[00:11:18] costing me this much money a month. I'm drowning, you know, I had wick and all that stuff hadn't
[00:11:23] kicked in yet. And I was like, cool, I'll buy you some formula. Like that is what financial freedom
[00:11:28] means to me. And being able to travel, we probably do like four pretty awesome trips every year.
[00:11:34] We're actually about to go to Europe for six weeks for the summer and I'm super stoked.
[00:11:39] Actually by the time you're listening to this, I'm probably in Europe. So I hope you're having a
[00:11:42] great summer too. So anyway, that financial freedom number is super important to you, to no one but
[00:11:52] you. No one else can define financial freedom for you. No one else can put a number to that.
[00:11:57] But it's up to you to decide what income do you need to be financially free? So define financial
[00:12:03] freedom for yourself, put a number to that and then make that your income goal. So if you're at
[00:12:11] $7,000 a month, that's what you need for everything that you have to pay for and everything you want to
[00:12:18] do. Do what you need to do to achieve that money. So what do I mean by that? Figure out how many
[00:12:26] closings that is, figure out how many signed leases, whatever your activity is, maybe you're doing
[00:12:32] revenue share, maybe you're doing agent attraction, like I am, figure out how many people you have to
[00:12:38] convert to get to that dollar amount. And whatever you need to put in to achieve that output. So
[00:12:46] let's go to like an example of $10,000 a month is your income goal, which is a pretty standard
[00:12:54] transaction, like closing commission. So now you look at that, you know, you have to close one
[00:13:01] deal every single month, which means you have to get at least one person under contract a month,
[00:13:10] at least one listing or a buyer, but you want to give yourself a little bit of a buffer because
[00:13:17] not every buyer is going to buy something, not every listing is going to sell. So you want to
[00:13:23] make sure that you are putting in the effort on the front side to achieve those outputs. And
[00:13:29] this again, this is trial and error. And you're going to have to do some key performance indicators,
[00:13:34] some metric tracking, figuring out what activities result in what income. Okay. But as a baseline,
[00:13:43] start with that dollar amount that you need, your monthly income goal, backwards plan to how many
[00:13:49] closings you're going to need, and then backwards plan to how many contracts you're going to need,
[00:13:54] and backwards plan from there to how many new connections you're going to need, how many people
[00:13:59] you're going to have to add to your database, to your email list, so that you are constantly generating
[00:14:04] that income month after month and constantly able to replicate that same model. And as you do that,
[00:14:12] you're going to get more and more efficient. You're going to figure out what activities are most
[00:14:16] productive, what things you need to do to achieve those goals. And then you just tweak those things,
[00:14:22] and you pull those levers, and you focus on specific things to increase your monthly income.
[00:14:30] Okay. Hopefully that makes sense. So it's all about backwards planning. But for your financial
[00:14:35] freedom number or your monthly income goal, go through all your needs, all your wants, plan
[00:14:42] for savings, plan for investments, make sure you're considering the splits that your broker is
[00:14:47] taking when you calculate this number, and then go from there, figure out how many
[00:14:52] closings you need, figure out how many clients that means you have to get signed or agree agreements
[00:14:58] with, and then figure out how much effort and activity it's going to take to get those clients.
[00:15:05] Okay. So that's your challenge for this week, this month rather, to set your monthly income goal.
[00:15:11] Go through this process, do the work, share it with me. I want to know what you come up with
[00:15:16] for your monthly income goal. And I want to know how you came up with it. And I really look
[00:15:20] forward to hearing from you. That is it for today. Thank you for being here. This is Erin Helle with
[00:15:26] the Business, Wealth, and Health. Grow with me, segment. Bye guys.

Hey guys, Erin Helle here with the Grow with Me series. We talk about business, wealth, and health. And today we are going to talk about figuring out your income goal as a REALTOR. Okay, so before we dive into it, let's recap our last episode. Last time we talked about social media and building a content calendar with 16 minutes, a 60 minute time block. So hopefully you guys did that. Hopefully you feel really good about that system and you can create a process that you can carry going forward and be really productive with your social media management. And hopefully all the work that you did before that to figure out your vision and your mission statement and what you're about as a REALTOR and even as a person. Hopefully all of that will help you with your content and make you really productive and really hyper focused. And again, make sure that you're focusing that time and time blocking it, keeping it protected on your calendar, being productive with it. And hopefully you'll start to do those things that same process with other things in your business too. Okay, so that's just a recap. Today again, we are going to talk about your income goal as a REALTOR. I think that the hardest part about being a REALTOR or about being self-employed is figuring out how to stay motivated. You know, that motivation is the hardest part. But I've found two ways to keep that motivation going constantly and consistently. When especially when you're feeling depressed, you have an rough day.

The things that help me sort of stay motivated and keep moving forward, putting one step in front of the other are goal setting and accountability.

But for your financial freedom number or your monthly income goal, go through all your needs, all your wants, plan for savings, plan for investments, make sure you're considering the splits that your broker is taking when you calculate this number, and then go from there, figure out how many closings you need, figure out how many clients that means you have to get signed or agree agreements with, and then figure out how much effort and activity it's going to take to get those clients. Okay. So that's your challenge for this week, this month rather, to set your monthly income goal. Go through this process, do the work, share it with me. I want to know what you come up with for your monthly income goal. And I want to know how you came up with it. And I really look forward to hearing from you. That is it for today. Thank you for being here. This is Erin Helle with the Business, Wealth, and Health. Grow with me, segment. Bye guys.
