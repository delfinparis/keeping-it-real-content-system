[00:04:01] Hi, thanks for having me. So nice to be here.
[00:04:04] Yeah, I am really grateful that you come on. You're a very, very popular person here in Chicago in the REALTOR community and we've never had you on the show and I know I see you at events and I am really grateful to finally have you on after all these years because you've really built.
[00:04:24] Incredible team. I've actually had some of your team members on the show before I've had Emily on and really would love to talk to you about what you think is happening right now what's happening with maybe will happen 2023 what agents can do to get prepared.
[00:04:41] But let's go all the way back to the beginning because I always think it's fun to hear about how you got into real estate. So do you mind sharing with our audience, you know, why real estate and how you got it.
[00:04:53] Sure, absolutely. Yeah, I got in in 2009, the worst time according to some to get into the industry.
[00:05:01] But truthfully, it was like perfectly timed for me. I got in because I was watching what was happening. I watched, you know, the housing market come to a screeching halt and essentially crash.
[00:05:12] And I have always been someone who really truly like value the power of home and what it can mean for you in your life.
[00:05:19] And I just could not understand how people could lose their homes like how could you have a foreclosure, how did, why were you having to do a short sale.
[00:05:27] And I really like it, it really broke my heart to watch this happening for people.
[00:05:35] And essentially quit the job that I was doing. I was in fashion merchandising quit that and jumped in full time into real estate in the like spring summer of 2009.
[00:05:48] And truthfully, never looked back since.
[00:05:52] So it's been a journey, but that my reason at the time and it still is the reason today is that I just truly wanted to help people who are experiencing so much so many feelings around something that to me is just so important, which is your home.
[00:06:06] So.
[00:06:07] Yeah, I think that's, I think that's very right on with respect to the fact that making a home buying or selling decision is it's an incredibly big decision for most people.
[00:06:20] And I mean, even for me when I bought my second condo, I mean, not a second, I only have one condo, but my second time purchasing a condo, I was surprised at how stressful it was for me, and I'm in the industry.
[00:06:39] And I have a lot of resources in my disposal, and I had a lot of people to ask to go to, I'm making a horrible mistake or is this a good investment.
[00:06:46] And even with all of that, it was still like really, really scary.
[00:06:51] And I'm curious how, you know, one of the things that I've always admired about you is I feel like you and your team are really good at understanding, you know, your clients needs and concerns and stress and anxiety.
[00:07:08] Do you think that's, is that an accurate description?
[00:07:10] Absolutely.
[00:07:11] You know, I think one of our like taglines for Chicago Home Collective is the journey is just as dear as the destination.
[00:07:18] And it's because we really believe that your whole experience leading you up to actually closing on your home and moving into your home.
[00:07:25] You carry that experience with you into your new home.
[00:07:28] And so to me, it was so important that you enjoy that process that you enjoy the journey of it and that your home not be marked like when your initial memories of your home is drama or stress or, you know, there's already usually a lot of life stuff already happening around a new home, you know, marriage, children or a new job or, you know, a breakup, like there's always something else that tends to accompany a trip.
[00:07:59] And so to us, we've really made it our personal responsibility that you enjoy that process because you carry that energy, you carry that memory into the new home.
[00:08:09] And so yeah, I mean, particularly in 2009 and that's why I was saying like that's why I got in was I just felt like we could do so much more.
[00:08:17] I can't change the circumstances.
[00:08:19] I couldn't change that people were having a short sale their homes and make these choices.
[00:08:23] But I could at least help that transition out of a home feel a lot more enjoyable the best that it could.
[00:08:32] And then also carried that into educating those who were going to start buying in that market.
[00:08:38] And also enjoying that process.
[00:08:40] So yeah, you think you nailed it spot on. I mean, that's really what we stand for Chicago, how collective is enjoying the journey.
[00:08:46] And you have a all female lead team. And is that intentional or in I'm curious tell us about your team.
[00:08:56] Yeah, oh my gosh, where did I start? They're the most fabulous humans in I've ever known like seriously there's such an extension of my own family now.
[00:09:04] It would be wild to not have them. I you know, started Chicago home collective eight years ago.
[00:09:11] And it wasn't because I wanted a team. It's just because I was growing and I did need support.
[00:09:18] But I was like, if I'm going to have support, I'd rather do it in a mentorship form.
[00:09:24] And so I started mentoring Emily who you've had on the show.
[00:09:28] And you know, that sort of birthed Chicago home collective. I was like, well, I guess I got to give this thing a name.
[00:09:34] And it's not the Kelly Parker team because it was never it's not about me.
[00:09:38] And this is what we also say Chicago home club it is not about us. It's about our clients.
[00:09:42] There's no real hierarchy within this team. We are all collaborating.
[00:09:46] We are all collectively working towards the same end goal.
[00:09:50] And so it started with with Emily and then over the years has multiplied.
[00:09:57] And now there's a total of eight of us. We are it is all female. You know, I think at first, I wouldn't say it was intentional.
[00:10:05] I would say this I don't recruit people come and ask to speak to me and to join the team.
[00:10:11] And I'm not surprised that it's women because a lot of how I speak and what I stand for.
[00:10:17] I think is is you know specific to females and a little bit different than some of the usual narrative in the industry.
[00:10:24] So it's now we are very proud off the male team and we will definitely be staying in all female team.
[00:10:30] I love it.
[00:10:32] Yeah.
[00:10:32] Well, you know, it's we're getting sort by the time this episode airs will be in December.
[00:10:38] It will be basically the end of the 2022, you know, business season.
[00:10:44] Where we're at currently is, you know, a lot of agents are thinking about 2023 trying to figure out what am I going to do differently in 2023?
[00:10:53] What are, you know, what skills do I want to develop? What goals do I want to set?
[00:10:57] What are the goals that you have to set?
[00:10:59] You know, how many homes might I want to sell? What is my production?
[00:11:02] Want to look like you have a very unique approach to thinking about sort of objectives.
[00:11:09] And I'd love to sort of dive into that.
[00:11:11] So how do you think about, you know, you're a business owner.
[00:11:14] You have a team.
[00:11:15] How are you thinking about next year?
[00:11:17] Wow.
[00:11:18] I think, you know, if I were to just speak to like goal setting specifically, I will say that I don't set goals.
[00:11:25] I don't have production goals or financial goals.
[00:11:30] And I know for some people that makes them crazy.
[00:11:32] And they're like, well, then you don't have a business plan if you don't have a goal.
[00:11:35] And I just don't operate like that.
[00:11:38] Like, truthfully, I believe that it changes the way you do things.
[00:11:43] The reason you do things changes the way you do things.
[00:11:47] So if I am doing things to reach a goal, and that is my focus, I truly believe it changes the way you do things.
[00:11:54] And often disconnects us from what our passion is, why we're really doing this.
[00:12:02] And from theirs where we derive a lot of our inspiration and our drive from.
[00:12:07] And so I think that I don't have a goal because it also then starts to feel very transactional.
[00:12:14] Right.
[00:12:15] Like, I always use the example of cold calling, right?
[00:12:18] People are like, well, if you cold call 10 people and you get two people to answer and then you get one of them as a client.
[00:12:24] It's the same sort of feeling of this highly transactional and removes this human to human sort of like a co creation, if you will, of the work that we're doing.
[00:12:34] I run a very relationship based business.
[00:12:38] I have, I am referral based.
[00:12:41] It was intentional.
[00:12:42] That's how I built my business from the beginning.
[00:12:44] I think that's the same thing.
[00:12:45] Because I also believe that whoever controls the leads, you know, controls the market controls the business.
[00:12:51] As I'm sure you've heard a thousand times and it and having that relationship then this isn't a transaction.
[00:12:58] These are not we cannot just reduce this just transactions and production.
[00:13:01] And so if I'm only measuring based on a production or a financial goal.
[00:13:06] I'm missing a lot of the other, you know, opportunities for growth.
[00:13:12] I'm missing a lot of the other successes that we're seeing.
[00:13:15] We we were kind of mentioning it prior to even I think recording like success is actually very different and looks very different than just production at times.
[00:13:24] And so.
[00:13:26] I really feel like the key to a lot of my success is that I didn't I don't have these goals.
[00:13:32] Now I measure at the end.
[00:13:34] I measure at the end of the year and I say, okay, like, yeah, how much production do we do?
[00:13:39] Let's celebrate that because that is valuable and it tells us something.
[00:13:45] But I use it as an after the fact measurement and not a, you know, care at this sort of like being dangled out in front of you.
[00:13:55] To kind of.
[00:13:56] Yeah, for sort of all those reasons that I stated, but.
[00:14:00] You just you said a lot right there and I want to just sort of unpack a little bit of that because I think this could be really helpful for for our audience.
[00:14:11] And you reminded me of and this is funny because I know nothing about sports, but there was a famous NCAA coach named John Wooden and he was.
[00:14:21] He was the UNL via or UCLA, I'm sorry, UCLA was the winningest coach in NCAA history.
[00:14:27] I think he still is. I think he won like seven NCAA tournaments in a row.
[00:14:31] I think he won like nine out of 13 or something ultimately in his career.
[00:14:35] But anyway, he's a big deal and he never looked at the scoreboard. And so you reminded me of him.
[00:14:40] And he would say and and and reporters and people that studied him and he was literally the winningest coach in NCAA history.
[00:14:47] And they would say, what do you mean you don't look at the scoreboard? How do you not look at the scoreboard?
[00:14:51] He goes because the he said the scoreboard is not really an accurate representation of the performance of my team.
[00:14:59] He said sometimes things like luck just falls your way sometimes luck doesn't fall your way.
[00:15:03] The numbers up on the scoreboard may or may not be reflective of like the actual effort that was put in.
[00:15:09] And he also had said there's times when we'll win a game because the score we we scored more than the other team.
[00:15:15] But we actually lost because we didn't actually play that well.
[00:15:20] And he's like you you can walk off the off the court. And even though we technically won if if you didn't play your best so and so team member, you're going to feel crappy about yourself.
[00:15:30] And as you walk off the field you're off the court, you're going to not feel good even though you technically won and vice versa.
[00:15:36] There's times when when you know you lose technically, but you played your best and you still feel okay about it.
[00:15:42] I'm sort of getting that vibe from you. It's sort of like let's let's just do our best and kind of let the chips fall where they may.
[00:15:51] And while that may seem a bit risky or non traditional.
[00:15:59] You are on top 1% producer. So it does actually it works.
[00:16:04] It works. It works. See, here's the thing. I do have parameters and I do have standards. And I think this is what's important is like I do set out the year thinking how do I want to grow.
[00:16:14] How do I need to align my actions to where I want to go.
[00:16:18] What how can I make my process and my experience for my clients even better. How can I be more knowledgeable and more experienced like I have things that I'm working towards.
[00:16:27] That I know if I keep those as my focus right.
[00:16:32] Then those will result in more clients and more transactions and ultimately the production.
[00:16:38] So then at the end of the year when we're measuring, you know, what was the production.
[00:16:43] If we feel like if I feel like dang I really I could have made begun further.
[00:16:48] It then tells me what do I need to learn. What do I need to do to be able to hold 50 million dollars in business.
[00:16:56] You know, and it starts to inform a whole other set of actions beyond just, you know, the traditional tactics, if you will, of like how to get clients and how to market yourself.
[00:17:09] I'm really way more focused on myself and also my team about our personal growth, our personal development, raising our standards.
[00:17:17] And I know as we do that, right, the business comes.
[00:17:22] It's, it's a lot of it's, it's your basically taking things on faith. I mean, really what we're talking about is this belief that if I do the actions that I'm pretty confident or if I do continue to develop skills that I'm pretty confident are our skills that my clients deserve and need and want.
[00:17:41] If I can develop those in myself, my business will I'll be able to offer more to my age or to my clients.
[00:17:49] And therefore I'll attract more clients because I'll be able to give more and I'll do better and then they'll refer more. Is that essentially the philosophy?
[00:17:59] Yeah, absolutely. I mean, if I were to reduce it down to one thing, I would say that it's personal power.
[00:18:04] I have a lot of personal power around my success and what I'm able to create my success does not is not predicated on the circumstances.
[00:18:13] It doesn't matter what's going on in the market. It doesn't matter what's going on with interest rates. It doesn't, it doesn't matter because I'm focused on myself and investing in myself and honing this skill and this expertise.
[00:18:26] And as long as I continue to to prioritize that, great, the rest, the rest follows.
[00:18:35] I want to pause for a moment to talk about our episode sponsor, one of my favorite companies out there, follow up boss.
[00:18:42] Now, after interviewing hundreds of top REALTORS in the country for this podcast, do you know which CRM is used by more than any other by our guests?

[00:19:51] Follow up like a boss with follow up boss and now back to our episode.
[00:19:56] Yeah, it's really it's really impressive actually. It's sort of the way the most of us I think think about goal setting as we start at the end.
[00:20:04] And you were we were talking about this before we started today was you sort of start with an end goal in mind. I want to, you know, I want to earn a certain amount of money or want to close a certain number of homes where I want a way a certain amount of pounds or I want to make a certain amount of money or whatever it might be.
[00:20:19] And and then we try to figure out a way to get from from here to there. And without real and you're right, it can think of it can become transactional because if you break it down to a smallest component, then you're like, okay, well in order for me to get to 50 million dollars in production, I need to make 25 phone calls a day and I need to have.
[00:20:39] And those and that may in fact work. I'm not here to say that it doesn't totally. Yeah.
[00:20:45] Another way to go about it would be I want to develop skills which would allow me to give more to be more to do more, which is a different a little bit of a different approach actually.
[00:20:59] And I actually I personally like that approach better in some ways because I also believe that there's always more to learn. There's always more and I think what consumers really want is competence.
[00:21:13] I think more than anything buyers sellers they just want somebody who knows what they're talking about and that is going to take time and it's an ongoing process of continuous learning.
[00:21:22] And I suspect that your clients know that about you that you're constantly learning evolving developing new skills and therefore, you know, again, you sort of work from a bottom up approach is a more as opposed to like a top down like top down might be okay, we want to get to a hundred million dollars in production bottom up might be hey, here are all the skills we need to develop to get to 100 million in production.
[00:21:48] We're going to focus on the skills. Absolutely. That's really interesting. Makes all the sense in the world.
[00:21:55] Yeah, because it really it's reducing everything down to this means to an end like you said, right? Like if you're top and then bottom there's automatically a huge separation, which like you're saying it forces your brain to be like well, then what do I need to do to get from here to here.
[00:22:09] And it you lose something in that process. And so when people ask me like how do you have the success you have it's like I've stayed really like connected to not just the like act of doing things like mailing postcards or sitting open houses, but like what is what is right for me.
[00:22:30] How do I develop myself and then show up in a way that's authentic and aligned for me and in doing so that draws in clients who like my style, who appreciate what I'm doing, who you know are connected to even my why like I share my why, why do I do what I do as sort of like a leading message with my clients because people want that connection.
[00:22:53] And then they're happy to refer me and the circle just continues.
[00:23:01] Do you mind sharing your why with us. What is your why?
[00:23:04] Oh, yeah, I mean the why is I just have such a deep.
[00:23:10] I really truly believe our homes provide a place where we can be free to be our full authentic cells.
[00:23:18] And there's not other than our four walls in a roof right when we go outside, we not always are that way we're dressing for a certain reason or we're talking in a certain way or we're doing certain actions for a certain outcome.
[00:23:32] But our home is like the safest place that hopefully you can be right and I just value the power of it for how it allows us to show up in our lives that to be a play a role in people, you know, starting that chapter and creating that mark in their life is just feels so special to me.
[00:23:55] And and then again, like the further why is like also just making sure they enjoy that process because I understand just how powerful it can be so.
[00:24:04] So saying saying connected to that I think has been one of the biggest.
[00:24:09] Biggest things for myself, but also even my team as new agents come on like sharing with them like, okay, how do I market myself? How do I get clients? I'm like share your why.
[00:24:17] Why do you do this? Because people want to know like because if not they're going to make up.
[00:24:23] This is what I've learned if you don't tell people why you do something they will make up why you do it.
[00:24:29] We all tell stories we all create stories about other people so tell people why you do it and it's the quickest way to diffuse something feeling like a transaction is like Emily right we use Emily is the example but like she really wanted to help her peers who were coming out of college who didn't have you know advocates when it came to finding their Chicago home and and it's true that's a good.
[00:24:53] I think it's true for her but she has shared that and people resonate with that and then choose to use her because of it and so I think that if there's one take away it just be be vocal about your why I think I kind of took us off course is what we're talking about.
[00:25:07] No, I don't think you took us off course at all I think this is all absolutely relevant because what we're really talking about is finding your tribe I think and understanding that there's going to be a certain subset of of the home buying or selling population that resonates with your particular style.
[00:25:29] So you might as well be the way I'm hearing you is you might as well be yourself because you know you've got to be yourself anyway and they're assuming your authentic and and you know you have the qualities that you know that are are helpful to people looking to buy our sell homes.
[00:25:46] You should have a pretty reasonable career but you shouldn't necessarily be afraid to say here's why I do what I do and in fact I think people connect more with understanding someone's why then then maybe even their actual skills I think we want to know why somebody does something I think the fact that they are competent at it is is first most important but then we want to know like why do you do this what what's in it for you and you just.
[00:26:16] And you know you can be eloquently shared why you do it and why it's important for you so that somebody can be their full authentic self in their home and you said it in a much better way than I just expressed it but I think that's really powerful because if you if you can have that conversation with clients and go the reason why I do this is I want you to be fully fully safe and and authentic in your house.
[00:26:40] I think you know I never thought of that until you had said it and as soon as you said it I was like that's absolutely right I feel the same way I want to feel safe and authentic in my home and it's it's this is kind of an intangible thing that might even sound a little there a new age or whatever but it's it's really true feelings are real in the sense of their important and we want to we we're going to be staying in this these this physical space for you know good chunk of our lives every single day so.
[00:27:07] And they try and those transcend markets to you're feeling about your home doesn't matter what's happening in the market right and your desire for new home or needing to move out of another one so I know it does it does sound new age you but it's to me it's it's like the heart of what.
[00:27:26] Yeah, this can do and I think particularly if you're an agent looking to grow your business and you're not sure how to market yourself or what to do it provides like to me it provides like a core element of like why do I do it so based on why i'm doing it then who are my clients.
[00:27:43] Who am I speaking to you know if it's like Emily it's like well why do I do this I want to help my peers okay then those are your clients that's who we market to that's your niche you know now you just have to tell them what you do and how you do it.
[00:27:55] And you'll and then you start to see the clients come in like they have.
[00:28:02] Yeah it really yeah I love that I said so it seems like what you're saying is to find your passion in in your in just in in this industry of what really moves the needle for you is the REALTOR like what what gets you the most excited about the process sort of digging in leaning into that and then continuing to divide.
[00:28:25] And then you develop skills around whatever that passion might be maybe it's first time home buyer maybe it's maybe it's maybe it's even being with somebody along their apartment journey until they're ready to buy their first home maybe it's being there to guide them or maybe it's I don't like working with those people I only like working with sellers or condos or or co or co ops or whatever it might be single family homes or or people moving from another state I guess whatever it is that you sort of get lit up the most.
[00:28:55] About is probably an indicator of like oh I really like doing reels you know I really like doing you know or or maybe you're one of those rare people who likes calling expires or fistbos like.
[00:29:08] Well right this is the thing like it works for people but it's not what they're doing it's it's the energy behind what they're doing it with so if you really love calling strangers and co calling fistbos and you're like I could do this all day.
[00:29:22] Then it is your indicator that that is your lane and go go crush it you know and so I think that's where we get a little bit scrambled of like we think that there's a certain ways that we have to get business and and then we force ourselves to show up in these ways and I'm like I don't really want to do that I don't really want a cold call I don't really want to sit in open house that feels weird to me or whatever we force ourselves and then we wonder why we're not getting business.
[00:29:49] And it's because we can it that and now I'm really going to sound new age but like the frequency of that precedes you precedes your words precedes your actions so if something lights you up double down on that do that and let that that excitement and that joy drive what you do after that and then the steps and the choices you start to make and how you show up in your business.
[00:30:16] I think that's really good advice so before we started talking today or sort of before we started turned on the recording where I was asking you about 2023 because we have I have we have 800 agents or close to 800 agents in our firm you've got a lot of agents obviously Compass has Kelly's a Compass they have thousands of agents here in Chicago Kelly is around a lot of agents I'm around a lot of agents and I'm certainly getting a sense that there's a
[00:30:45] low level of stress that's that's that's present right now though I feel like there's always stress being a REALTOR but particularly right now it's the end of the year it's the holiday season we're of course we know where rates are we know inventory is is where it is and I know there's a lot of concern about 2023 as I'm hearing it in the ether from other agents but you don't you're not worried about it at all and I really I'm bringing this up because you're the first person I've talked to who doesn't
[00:31:14] who didn't even break a sweat when I mentioned it so why are you not worried about 2023.
[00:31:22] Well I think for some of the reasons I've mentioned right I think that I've never let my success be dictated on the circumstances you know I really truly believe that the success that I've seen in my business is because of what I've who I am and what I've done and the skills that I have developed
[00:31:42] and I think that's where we get a little bit hung up a lot of times when people are stressed it's because they have made their success circumstantial on a low interest rate market or a pandemic and I think some people like there's elements as is there a percentage of my business that was up because of the circumstances sure but would I have still been successful and still done what I've done because of my own sort of like personal power in my
[00:32:12] myself and my belief in all that absolutely so I truly believe that because I have that outlook it doesn't matter what's going on in the market and and so I'm not worried but I'm also like I'm weirdly excited I think it's great I think this is the market where we get the ability we have the opportunity to make the biggest moves and the biggest growth and secure the most market share and
[00:32:39] and I fully know that I have the skill set and I have the knowledge and I I have the inspiration to make sure that I'm able to to operate as I want to during this time so I think that yeah.
[00:32:58] No it's so interesting it's just not even you're not too worried about circumstance you're not worried about sort of the conditions because number one you can't control them so you have to deal with them anyway and number two you started in a dawn market right so you started at you know 2008 to 2010 was not the time to get into real estate and but it was probably such a great time for you because you only knew a difficult
[00:33:27] challenge and so and you got through it and so then you see maybe maybe the mountain looks a little steeper this next year for a number of reasons outside of our control but you're just I are you just going to pivot if need be and make adjustments and changes and you know
[00:33:46] you're you're tell me what what you're thinking about well I think that like I mean I'm curious what you mean my pivot but I think that one thing that I talked to my team a lot about
[00:33:57] is like being aware of the context that we hold for our business right like looking at just next year to me is a very small context I have a 13 year career right there's going to be chapters and even if you've had a three year career this is a chapter of the greater story of the career that you are writing and so if you're so hyper focused on you know the next six months or the next 12 months
[00:34:25] again it kind of goes back to like you start to inform how you behave and how you show up and it's going to change it if you can just keep a broader context of like we might have a down year next year sure possibly yes do I need to be responsible business owner and start to make some modifications to like our spend and make sure that we're not you know that I'm being smart absolutely I can do those things you know and then we see what happens and we
[00:34:53] we I don't pull back on investing I still invest in this in in the support that we need and this is the stuff that we know works for us but I think that I have a broader context if you will for for what this will mean in the greater story and so I know everyone's talking about 2023 but I think in my mind I'm already in like 2025 because I can see how this will play in the next few years
[00:35:20] yes it's a really important point because I think I think you just said something really really big which was I'm thinking about 2025 because 2025 is going to come and we're only thinking about 2023 like you were saying a lot of us are just focused on you know we might be a survival mode or we might be just nervous about but regardless it's going to come and go and we're going to need to adapt and also they're you right there there are cycles
[00:35:50] and there are ups and downs and life isn't linear businesses and linear and that's that's the the challenge I think for some of us when we get into the business and we have our first five years and it just looks like this linear graph up into the right because we sell more homes every year than we did previously
[00:36:08] and then maybe all of a sudden the market you know has a correction or you know the there's other factors at play that that affect our ability to keep that trajectory going and it doesn't necessarily mean the end of our business it just means that you know the natural cycle of life
[00:36:27] there's ups and downs and things that happen but it's it's about really weathering the storm so you were saying like yeah of course as a business owner I'm going to make responsible decisions I'm going to keep my spend in in check and I'm going to make sure that you know my team is getting the resources that they need but we're going to we're going to make it through because I'm already thinking of 2025 see I think that's really interesting I don't know how many people think that way and I think that comes with experience which is which is what you have
[00:36:54] yeah I think so you know I think I've always had a unique outlook just in general on what we're doing here which is why I tend to just kind of keep my head down and I kind of just do my own thing because I don't I don't want to get to influence if you will by you know by by narratives and opinions and things like that I think that what you touched on about being linear really takes us full circle back to like the whole production
[00:37:24] and goals and success because we think that like if we do these things we'll get this end result and we can contain it into a whole year when the truth is stuff that you're going to do in 2023 is actually going to pay you in 2025 but we don't let ourselves accept that or see that or measure that because it's not this like tangible thing in front of us right now and so I I always like kind of load this time of year I mean we're speaking it's November it's like everyone should be so excited right now about what we want to do is so excited and we're going to take this.
[00:37:54] what they did in 2022 and celebrating and go on vacation and don't worry and just like
[00:38:01] live your life because everyone has worked so hard the last couple years. But I'm watching
[00:38:06] agents not do it because they're starting to freak out about next year and thinking they have
[00:38:11] to pull back and they're just like automatically bypassing to me what is the most important
[00:38:18] component to continued success which is honoring what you've accomplished, celebrating it,
[00:38:24] sharing it, like sitting in it and knowing that it doesn't end January 1. It carries it carries
[00:38:32] with you and there's going to be stuff you did this year you never saw the production for that
[00:38:36] will show up next year or maybe in 2024 or 2025 like we don't know and so I think if I can just
[00:38:42] share one thing as someone who's been in this business as long as I have now it's like
[00:38:46] it's never contained to a year ever. It always bleeds over into each other so let's not
[00:38:53] let's not be so linear and how we measure and and where we begin and end these chapters of the story.
[00:39:01] Yeah I agree I want to talk about celebration because I that's not something I've really
[00:39:08] delved into too much in this show and I think it's something that's worth worthwhile to talk about
[00:39:13] because I think since so many REALTORS are individual practitioners or maybe they are on a team
[00:39:21] and there is some sort of recognition about you know milestones or certain types of activity gets
[00:39:27] noticed or appreciated but I do think that it would likely be a good idea for people individually
[00:39:37] to learn how to celebrate their own achievement and it doesn't necessarily have to be related to
[00:39:44] a goal that that got hit could be a skill that was learned it could be the way that you know somebody
[00:39:50] improved their customer service could be a way in which you know something got better or
[00:39:56] or something new was was brought in. I'm curious how do you recommend to people to celebrate their
[00:40:03] success because I think we don't we do a lot of it on social media right there's a lot of like look
[00:40:09] at me I just sold this home I don't I'm not talking about that I'm talking internally processing
[00:40:16] feeling actually good about something that you accomplish because and the reason I'm making such a
[00:40:21] big deal of this and I'm going to be in a moment just turn it over to you is I think that can help
[00:40:27] get us through the hard times if we can remember what it feels like so what are your thoughts on that?
[00:40:32] Absolutely I love this question and specifically like the this the separation to the external right
[00:40:38] like social media is a tricky beast and and I think that a lot of people think that they have to
[00:40:45] celebrate as a form of validation and so there's a little bit in my mind too much ego that gets
[00:40:52] attached and I think this is what we've all felt right we see the celebration and you're like uh
[00:40:56] that kind of feels feels like it's a little bit loaded right and it's it's and it's okay we're humans
[00:41:03] we all have egos there's that moment of wanting to like wave the flag of what you've done and what
[00:41:08] you've accomplished in a tangible material form but I think that it's it cause that seeing other people
[00:41:17] do that there's a certain sort of subset of people who like myself who are so turned off from that
[00:41:22] that I've actually held off on celebrating because I didn't want to come off as a certain way
[00:41:28] and I didn't want it to feel a certain way because again why I do what I do is so heartfelt and like
[00:41:35] heart led that the dollars and the goals and or the the celebrations will never really capture
[00:41:45] all of that right but it I have learned that celebrating is truly the biggest form of
[00:41:52] expressing your gratitude and I'm I'm really I mean I have my own mentor and that came in light of
[00:42:01] a conversation I had with her about how how that's really what it is like you're it can be done
[00:42:08] behind closed doors it can be done with your team it's like what you're asking and so we do a lot
[00:42:13] of closed doors celebrations like you know we and in our a lot of our goals same thing our personal
[00:42:19] and production and whatever so we're never just celebrating the medal achieved we're celebrating
[00:42:25] the whole human and so I do think it's incredibly important to anchor that in for the reason that
[00:42:32] you said it's something that creates a tangible you know feeling inside of you or recognition
[00:42:39] for what you've done I would say that I celebrate myself and my accomplishments in in several
[00:42:47] different ways I think what you were saying for even for me right now this year one of my biggest
[00:42:53] accomplishments is that I got to spend more time with my daughter and nothing was sacrificed to do it
[00:43:00] and that has been something I had to learn the hard way and I worked really hard to get at so
[00:43:05] you know do I have like extra production to show for something no but I have these memories
[00:43:10] and these experiences with her and and that's something right and and so I as I'm living life I think
[00:43:17] being very present in my moments of recognizing that I don't have to wait until the end of the year
[00:43:23] to celebrate that a lot of the time we are we are our goals and our dreams are actually being
[00:43:30] are actualized in everyday moments yeah but we're just not present enough to see them so I think
[00:43:37] I have a sense of presence out of just sort of like reverence for celebration in general but
[00:43:44] I do like to travel that's kind of always been my thing that I feel like traveling gives you this
[00:43:49] sense of experience and I it's like I sort of hard for me to explain without over talking but like
[00:43:56] it there's something that really helps me anchor a feeling around a celebration and so I actually
[00:44:03] tend to use use that but again I know I said a lot I want to encourage people to celebrate because
[00:44:09] I think that seeing others celebrate helps to give people examples of what's possible and if you're
[00:44:17] looking for a way to ground yourself in a celebration so it doesn't feel so showy and look at me
[00:44:23] I always just go to the place of can this provide an example to another female in the industry
[00:44:28] about what's possible you know five years in your business eight years in your business you know
[00:44:34] and and kind of be mindful I guess of the narrative with what you're approaching it but
[00:44:39] yeah the idea of celebration you you really got me thinking I was I was thinking it got me thinking
[00:44:46] about the for anyone who's ever looked into relationship stuff you probably you know if you have
[00:44:53] a significant other and you're trying to get along better with them and have a better relationship
[00:44:58] you probably will stumble across the gotman the gotmans who are who are kind of the the world experts
[00:45:05] and researchers on how people can can coexist and cohabitate and they've written a million books and
[00:45:12] there are a married couple thought of I think out of Oregon or Washington anyway but anyway they have
[00:45:18] they have this ratio that they've proven that for a healthy interpersonal relationship you know
[00:45:26] romantic relationship the golden ratio is five affirming things for every one sort of negative
[00:45:34] thing and very critical thing one critical thing so if I want to say oh you know you're doing the
[00:45:39] dishes the wrong way or whatever or you didn't do the dishes or whatever whatever the criticism might
[00:45:43] be if you can if you can have five affirming things but here's all the here are the things you did
[00:45:49] right you know you would sprinkle those throughout the day that's what a healthy relationship and a
[00:45:54] happy relationship looks like it's five affirming things to everyone one sort of non-affirming
[00:45:59] thing and what you were saying is really important because you're talking about celebration and I was
[00:46:04] thinking about that and I was thinking how often do I celebrate myself for the things that I may
[00:46:10] have accomplished or in our listeners ears what you have accomplished today you definitely did some
[00:46:16] things well today and I did some things well and I did some things that maybe I could improve on
[00:46:21] but how often am I even celebrating those little milestones and I used to think you had to get to
[00:46:27] the end of the goal before you could celebrate but I've learned and I'm curious to get your thoughts
[00:46:31] I've learned that celebrating along the way it actually keeps keeps the engine running for me
[00:46:37] it doesn't actually stop the motivation like oh I accomplished it I'm good no because that was
[00:46:43] kind of my fears I can't can't celebrate until I get to the end and I think that's a mistake
[00:46:48] because we're talking about celebrating throughout the journey and I think there's a lot of
[00:46:54] you know you hear about like gratitude groups I don't think we have a gratitude problem I think
[00:46:59] we have a celebration problem yeah I think we're all I think we're all grateful or if you're not
[00:47:05] whatever there's there's there's lots of ways to become grateful but I think the bigger issue is
[00:47:09] around celebrating one's own you know power agency success curious to get to get your thoughts on there
[00:47:16] yeah no I would agree I think that the celebration somewhere along the way got tainted right and
[00:47:23] and to your point it's like if we just bring it back to the gratitude and you just can focus on that
[00:47:28] then then it helps clear the air for a lot of other people to step into their own gratitude so I
[00:47:34] think we've tangled celebration in gratitude so it's like people aren't even taking a moment to
[00:47:39] be grateful for what they've done or accomplished because it feels gross and it feels showy or they
[00:47:45] have were very tangled in that and so I yeah I would agree I think we have more of a celebration
[00:47:53] problem and to your to your point of you know I think a lot of people wait until the end of the year
[00:48:00] they wait till they hit the goal but the truth is the goal post literally moves every time like okay
[00:48:08] I wanted you 20 million dollars I did 20 million dollars and I was like like we did it like okay like
[00:48:14] it and then the next without if you're not conscious and you're not aware it's automatically 25
[00:48:21] before you even like get 20 out of your mouth right and then it's 30 and then it's 35 and all the
[00:48:27] sudden you're living your life towards this end goal and you're missing all of the moments in between
[00:48:35] all of the beautiful things that have compounded and compounded that are worth celebrating on the way
[00:48:41] to this you know this goal and and I also think being present in those moments of yourself and
[00:48:48] celebrating yourself really helps this to not feel like a winner or lose yeah right if you have a
[00:48:55] goal and you don't make it then it means you lost if you have a goal and you made it then it means
[00:49:00] you succeeded and I think that diametrically I don't even know if that's the right word that's
[00:49:05] what I want to use but like that that sort of like two-dimensional like you winner you lose mentality
[00:49:11] is what keeps so many people from celebrating because so like why didn't hit my goal well that wasn't
[00:49:17] the definition of success did you show up every day have you grown have you changed did you help
[00:49:22] someone you know that's what we should be celebrating well I think that's a wonderful place to
[00:49:30] sort of wrap up because I this idea of celebration is it is the time of year to celebrate you know
[00:49:36] we're the holiday season this is time to reflect to be thankful and also to think to the future
[00:49:45] and and you're already doing that but I think it's in to your point about being
[00:49:52] increasing the celebration there are I think it would it would be really neat to almost even start
[00:49:58] like a celebration accountability partner where every week instead of just talking about what
[00:50:04] you accomplished well in addition to holding each other accountable for things that you want to
[00:50:09] accomplish which I think is a good idea also having some sort of celebration even if it's just
[00:50:15] between one to one one person to another hey man great job this week hey so and so you know you
[00:50:21] even if you didn't necessarily achieve your goal you're still on target you're you're still trying
[00:50:26] you're still you know this this idea of encouragement really just gets everyone through the hard times
[00:50:32] and I think I think we're coming up on some some more difficult well it's been difficult to be a
[00:50:38] REALTOR in the last couple of years I mean I also want to say just because rates were lower didn't
[00:50:42] make it any easier to be a REALTOR with in fact it you I mean I wasn't out there in the trenches
[00:50:47] with like you and your team I mean it was hard to be a REALTOR last couple years it was hard and
[00:50:52] I think that's why my outlook for the next year is very different is because I think that
[00:50:58] yeah it's it was hard and it was there was a lot of other things we were having to navigate
[00:51:04] and a lot of certain clients in the market for different reasons and I think that we get again we
[00:51:09] going to get to decide what this means and I think I'm making this mean that it'll be at a pace
[00:51:14] that's more sustainable it'll be with you know slightly more favorable outcomes for all clients I
[00:51:21] think it was very skewed the last you know couple years so again it's just sort of that perspective
[00:51:26] shift on what we make these markets mean but yeah they haven't they haven't been easy and so I
[00:51:32] really hope that everybody does celebrate I love what you said actually about an accountability
[00:51:37] partner because something I've been thinking about and we try to do this we could be better at it
[00:51:42] is celebrating agents that you don't actually like aren't maybe even in your team I see so many
[00:51:48] women particularly in these magazines who who accomplish amazing things and I'm like
[00:51:56] DMing them why isn't this on your Instagram why didn't you talk about this like we're celebrating you
[00:52:02] I think we the we could lead by example and celebrate each other and congratulate each other without
[00:52:10] prompt because it really helps I think us all feel a little bit more seen and accepted and encourage
[00:52:18] to celebrate ourselves so I think that's a great point you know for everyone listening pay attention
[00:52:25] to the milestones that other people might be hitting people that you like that you respect
[00:52:30] reach out to them when those milestones happen it might be exactly what they need to hear and they
[00:52:36] may just be more like Kelly who's like I don't really want to put that out there because maybe
[00:52:41] I'd seen as show offy and and put it out there for them be proud of of the people that in your
[00:52:47] community and watch what happens you you're not going to do it for this boomerang reason that it's
[00:52:53] going to come back to you but it probably will come back to you too this idea of of lifting other
[00:52:59] other people up you know in their successes oh it's worked well for me I've I've had a similar
[00:53:06] mentality when I when I see things that happen to people that are very impressive to me I'll
[00:53:13] often I'll reach out to them and just say like congratulations on on such and such even people
[00:53:17] I don't know and and I found that in many cases they will say things like you're the only person
[00:53:23] that reached out to me it doesn't make me a great guy it just makes me the one person who did it
[00:53:27] and any way he can do that and what I think well what what what comes with that is a lot of times a
[00:53:34] lot of opportunity ends up coming from that because people will go wow well that's nice that so
[00:53:39] and so thought about me I'm gonna take a closer look at this this particular individual it's
[00:53:44] almost very similar to what you do for clients this idea of giving to to giving give give give
[00:53:50] authentically and then you know you sort of hope that things come back and they do
[00:53:54] but we should also talk about your team your team is growing you know 2023 is not a scary year for
[00:53:59] you so if there are anyone who thinks that they would love to work with someone like Kelly and maybe

[00:54:12] that our listeners can reach out if they think they'd be a fit. Dima's on Instagram we are in the

All of those links will be in our show notes. You don't have to type them in Kelly. Welcome to the show. Hi, thanks for having me. So nice to be here. Yeah, I am really grateful that you come on. You're a very, very popular person here in Chicago in the REALTOR community and we've never had you on the show and I know I see you at events and I am really grateful to finally have you on after all these years because you've really built. Incredible team. I've actually had some of your team members on the show before I've had Emily on and really would love to talk to you about what you think is happening right now what's happening with maybe will happen 2023 what agents can do to get prepared. But let's go all the way back to the beginning because I always think it's fun to hear about how you got into real estate. So do you mind sharing with our audience, you know, why real estate and how you got it. Sure, absolutely. Yeah, I got in in 2009, the worst time according to some to get into the industry. But truthfully, it was like perfectly timed for me. I got in because I was watching what was happening. I watched, you know, the housing market come to a screeching halt and essentially crash. And I have always been someone who really truly like value the power of home and what it can mean for you in your life. And I just could not understand how people could lose their homes like how could you have a foreclosure, how did, why were you having to do a short sale. And I really like it, it really broke my heart to watch this happening for people. And essentially quit the job that I was doing. I was in fashion merchandising quit that and jumped in full time into real estate in the like spring summer of 2009. And truthfully, never looked back since. So it's been a journey, but that my reason at the time and it still is the reason today is that I just truly wanted to help people who are experiencing so much so many feelings around something that to me is just so important, which is your home. So. Yeah, I think that's, I think that's very right on with respect to the fact that making a home buying or selling decision is it's an incredibly big decision for most people. And I mean, even for me when I bought my second condo, I mean, not a second, I only have one condo, but my second time purchasing a condo, I was surprised at how stressful it was for me, and I'm in the industry. And I have a lot of resources in my disposal, and I had a lot of people to ask to go to, I'm making a horrible mistake or is this a good investment. And even with all of that, it was still like really, really scary. And I'm curious how, you know, one of the things that I've always admired about you is I feel like you and your team are really good at understanding, you know, your clients needs and concerns and stress and anxiety. Do you think that's, is that an accurate description? Absolutely. You know, I think one of our like taglines for Chicago Home Collective is the journey is just as dear as the destination. And it's because we really believe that your whole experience leading you up to actually closing on your home and moving into your home. You carry that experience with you into your new home. And so to me, it was so important that you enjoy that process that you enjoy the journey of it and that your home not be marked like when your initial memories of your home is drama or stress or, you know, there's already usually a lot of life stuff already happening around a new home, you know, marriage, children or a new job or, you know, a breakup, like there's always something else that tends to accompany a trip. And so to us, we've really made it our personal responsibility that you enjoy that process because you carry that energy, you carry that memory into the new home. And so yeah, I mean, particularly in 2009 and that's why I was saying like that's why I got in was I just felt like we could do so much more. I can't change the circumstances. I couldn't change that people were having a short sale their homes and make these choices. But I could at least help that transition out of a home feel a lot more enjoyable the best that it could. And then also carried that into educating those who were going to start buying in that market. And also enjoying that process. So yeah, you think you nailed it spot on. I mean, that's really what we stand for Chicago, how collective is enjoying the journey. And you have a all female lead team. And is that intentional or in I'm curious tell us about your team. Yeah, oh my gosh, where did I start? They're the most fabulous humans in I've ever known like seriously there's such an extension of my own family now. It would be wild to not have them. I you know, started Chicago home collective eight years ago. And it wasn't because I wanted a team. It's just because I was growing and I did need support. But I was like, if I'm going to have support, I'd rather do it in a mentorship form. And so I started mentoring Emily who you've had on the show. And you know, that sort of birthed Chicago home collective. I was like, well, I guess I got to give this thing a name. And it's not the Kelly Parker team because it was never it's not about me. And this is what we also say Chicago home club it is not about us. It's about our clients. There's no real hierarchy within this team. We are all collaborating. We are all collectively working towards the same end goal. And so it started with with Emily and then over the years has multiplied. And now there's a total of eight of us. We are it is all female. You know, I think at first, I wouldn't say it was intentional. I would say this I don't recruit people come and ask to speak to me and to join the team. And I'm not surprised that it's women because a lot of how I speak and what I stand for. I think is is you know specific to females and a little bit different than some of the usual narrative in the industry. So it's now we are very proud off the male team and we will definitely be staying in all female team. I love it. Yeah. Well, you know, it's we're getting sort by the time this episode airs will be in December. It will be basically the end of the 2022, you know, business season. Where we're at currently is, you know, a lot of agents are thinking about 2023 trying to figure out what am I going to do differently in 2023? What are, you know, what skills do I want to develop? What goals do I want to set? What are the goals that you have to set? You know, how many homes might I want to sell? What is my production? Want to look like you have a very unique approach to thinking about sort of objectives. And I'd love to sort of dive into that. So how do you think about, you know, you're a business owner. You have a team. How are you thinking about next year? Wow. I think, you know, if I were to just speak to like goal setting specifically, I will say that I don't set goals. I don't have production goals or financial goals. And I know for some people that makes them crazy. And they're like, well, then you don't have a business plan if you don't have a goal. And I just don't operate like that. Like, truthfully, I believe that it changes the way you do things. The reason you do things changes the way you do things. So if I am doing things to reach a goal, and that is my focus, I truly believe it changes the way you do things. And often disconnects us from what our passion is, why we're really doing this. And from theirs where we derive a lot of our inspiration and our drive from. And so I think that I don't have a goal because it also then starts to feel very transactional. Right. Like, I always use the example of cold calling, right? People are like, well, if you cold call 10 people and you get two people to answer and then you get one of them as a client. It's the same sort of feeling of this highly transactional and removes this human to human sort of like a co creation, if you will, of the work that we're doing. I run a very relationship based business. I have, I am referral based. It was intentional. That's how I built my business from the beginning. I think that's the same thing. Because I also believe that whoever controls the leads, you know, controls the market controls the business. As I'm sure you've heard a thousand times and it and having that relationship then this isn't a transaction. These are not we cannot just reduce this just transactions and production. And so if I'm only measuring based on a production or a financial goal. I'm missing a lot of the other, you know, opportunities for growth. I'm missing a lot of the other successes that we're seeing. We we were kind of mentioning it prior to even I think recording like success is actually very different and looks very different than just production at times. And so. I really feel like the key to a lot of my success is that I didn't I don't have these goals. Now I measure at the end. I measure at the end of the year and I say, okay, like, yeah, how much production do we do? Let's celebrate that because that is valuable and it tells us something. But I use it as an after the fact measurement and not a, you know, care at this sort of like being dangled out in front of you. To kind of. Yeah, for sort of all those reasons that I stated, but. You just you said a lot right there and I want to just sort of unpack a little bit of that because I think this could be really helpful for for our audience. And you reminded me of and this is funny because I know nothing about sports, but there was a famous NCAA coach named John Wooden and he was. He was the UNL via or UCLA, I'm sorry, UCLA was the winningest coach in NCAA history. I think he still is. I think he won like seven NCAA tournaments in a row. I think he won like nine out of 13 or something ultimately in his career. But anyway, he's a big deal and he never looked at the scoreboard. And so you reminded me of him. And he would say and and and reporters and people that studied him and he was literally the winningest coach in NCAA history. And they would say, what do you mean you don't look at the scoreboard? How do you not look at the scoreboard? He goes because the he said the scoreboard is not really an accurate representation of the performance of my team. He said sometimes things like luck just falls your way sometimes luck doesn't fall your way. The numbers up on the scoreboard may or may not be reflective of like the actual effort that was put in. And he also had said there's times when we'll win a game because the score we we scored more than the other team. But we actually lost because we didn't actually play that well. And he's like you you can walk off the off the court. And even though we technically won if if you didn't play your best so and so team member, you're going to feel crappy about yourself. And as you walk off the field you're off the court, you're going to not feel good even though you technically won and vice versa. There's times when when you know you lose technically, but you played your best and you still feel okay about it. I'm sort of getting that vibe from you. It's sort of like let's let's just do our best and kind of let the chips fall where they may. And while that may seem a bit risky or non traditional. You are on top 1% producer. So it does actually it works. It works. It works. See, here's the thing. I do have parameters and I do have standards. And I think this is what's important is like I do set out the year thinking how do I want to grow. How do I need to align my actions to where I want to go. What how can I make my process and my experience for my clients even better. How can I be more knowledgeable and more experienced like I have things that I'm working towards. That I know if I keep those as my focus right. Then those will result in more clients and more transactions and ultimately the production. So then at the end of the year when we're measuring, you know, what was the production. If we feel like if I feel like dang I really I could have made begun further. It then tells me what do I need to learn. What do I need to do to be able to hold 50 million dollars in business. You know, and it starts to inform a whole other set of actions beyond just, you know, the traditional tactics, if you will, of like how to get clients and how to market yourself. I'm really way more focused on myself and also my team about our personal growth, our personal development, raising our standards. And I know as we do that, right, the business comes. It's, it's a lot of it's, it's your basically taking things on faith. I mean, really what we're talking about is this belief that if I do the actions that I'm pretty confident or if I do continue to develop skills that I'm pretty confident are our skills that my clients deserve and need and want. If I can develop those in myself, my business will I'll be able to offer more to my age or to my clients. And therefore I'll attract more clients because I'll be able to give more and I'll do better and then they'll refer more. Is that essentially the philosophy? Yeah, absolutely. I mean, if I were to reduce it down to one thing, I would say that it's personal power. I have a lot of personal power around my success and what I'm able to create my success does not is not predicated on the circumstances. It doesn't matter what's going on in the market. It doesn't matter what's going on with interest rates. It doesn't, it doesn't matter because I'm focused on myself and investing in myself and honing this skill and this expertise. And as long as I continue to to prioritize that, great, the rest, the rest follows. I want to pause for a moment to talk about our episode sponsor, one of my favorite companies out there, follow up boss. Now, after interviewing hundreds of top REALTORS in the country for this podcast, do you know which CRM is used by more than any other by our guests? Of course, it is follow up boss and let's face it, following up is the key to taking your business to the next level. Follow up boss will help you drive more leads in less time and with less effort.

That's follow up boss dot com forward slash real for your free 30 day trial. Follow up like a boss with follow up boss and now back to our episode. Yeah, it's really it's really impressive actually. It's sort of the way the most of us I think think about goal setting as we start at the end. And you were we were talking about this before we started today was you sort of start with an end goal in mind. I want to, you know, I want to earn a certain amount of money or want to close a certain number of homes where I want a way a certain amount of pounds or I want to make a certain amount of money or whatever it might be. And and then we try to figure out a way to get from from here to there. And without real and you're right, it can think of it can become transactional because if you break it down to a smallest component, then you're like, okay, well in order for me to get to 50 million dollars in production, I need to make 25 phone calls a day and I need to have. And those and that may in fact work. I'm not here to say that it doesn't totally. Yeah. Another way to go about it would be I want to develop skills which would allow me to give more to be more to do more, which is a different a little bit of a different approach actually. And I actually I personally like that approach better in some ways because I also believe that there's always more to learn. There's always more and I think what consumers really want is competence. I think more than anything buyers sellers they just want somebody who knows what they're talking about and that is going to take time and it's an ongoing process of continuous learning. And I suspect that your clients know that about you that you're constantly learning evolving developing new skills and therefore, you know, again, you sort of work from a bottom up approach is a more as opposed to like a top down like top down might be okay, we want to get to a hundred million dollars in production bottom up might be hey, here are all the skills we need to develop to get to 100 million in production. We're going to focus on the skills. Absolutely. That's really interesting. Makes all the sense in the world. Yeah, because it really it's reducing everything down to this means to an end like you said, right? Like if you're top and then bottom there's automatically a huge separation, which like you're saying it forces your brain to be like well, then what do I need to do to get from here to here. And it you lose something in that process. And so when people ask me like how do you have the success you have it's like I've stayed really like connected to not just the like act of doing things like mailing postcards or sitting open houses, but like what is what is right for me. How do I develop myself and then show up in a way that's authentic and aligned for me and in doing so that draws in clients who like my style, who appreciate what I'm doing, who you know are connected to even my why like I share my why, why do I do what I do as sort of like a leading message with my clients because people want that connection. And then they're happy to refer me and the circle just continues. Do you mind sharing your why with us. What is your why? Oh, yeah, I mean the why is I just have such a deep. I really truly believe our homes provide a place where we can be free to be our full authentic cells. And there's not other than our four walls in a roof right when we go outside, we not always are that way we're dressing for a certain reason or we're talking in a certain way or we're doing certain actions for a certain outcome. But our home is like the safest place that hopefully you can be right and I just value the power of it for how it allows us to show up in our lives that to be a play a role in people, you know, starting that chapter and creating that mark in their life is just feels so special to me. And and then again, like the further why is like also just making sure they enjoy that process because I understand just how powerful it can be so. So saying saying connected to that I think has been one of the biggest. Biggest things for myself, but also even my team as new agents come on like sharing with them like, okay, how do I market myself? How do I get clients? I'm like share your why. Why do you do this? Because people want to know like because if not they're going to make up. This is what I've learned if you don't tell people why you do something they will make up why you do it. We all tell stories we all create stories about other people so tell people why you do it and it's the quickest way to diffuse something feeling like a transaction is like Emily right we use Emily is the example but like she really wanted to help her peers who were coming out of college who didn't have you know advocates when it came to finding their Chicago home and and it's true that's a good. I think it's true for her but she has shared that and people resonate with that and then choose to use her because of it and so I think that if there's one take away it just be be vocal about your why I think I kind of took us off course is what we're talking about. No, I don't think you took us off course at all I think this is all absolutely relevant because what we're really talking about is finding your tribe I think and understanding that there's going to be a certain subset of of the home buying or selling population that resonates with your particular style. So you might as well be the way I'm hearing you is you might as well be yourself because you know you've got to be yourself anyway and they're assuming your authentic and and you know you have the qualities that you know that are are helpful to people looking to buy our sell homes. You should have a pretty reasonable career but you shouldn't necessarily be afraid to say here's why I do what I do and in fact I think people connect more with understanding someone's why then then maybe even their actual skills I think we want to know why somebody does something I think the fact that they are competent at it is is first most important but then we want to know like why do you do this what what's in it for you and you just. And you know you can be eloquently shared why you do it and why it's important for you so that somebody can be their full authentic self in their home and you said it in a much better way than I just expressed it but I think that's really powerful because if you if you can have that conversation with clients and go the reason why I do this is I want you to be fully fully safe and and authentic in your house. I think you know I never thought of that until you had said it and as soon as you said it I was like that's absolutely right I feel the same way I want to feel safe and authentic in my home and it's it's this is kind of an intangible thing that might even sound a little there a new age or whatever but it's it's really true feelings are real in the sense of their important and we want to we we're going to be staying in this these this physical space for you know good chunk of our lives every single day so. And they try and those transcend markets to you're feeling about your home doesn't matter what's happening in the market right and your desire for new home or needing to move out of another one so I know it does it does sound new age you but it's to me it's it's like the heart of what. Yeah, this can do and I think particularly if you're an agent looking to grow your business and you're not sure how to market yourself or what to do it provides like to me it provides like a core element of like why do I do it so based on why i'm doing it then who are my clients. Who am I speaking to you know if it's like Emily it's like well why do I do this I want to help my peers okay then those are your clients that's who we market to that's your niche you know now you just have to tell them what you do and how you do it. And you'll and then you start to see the clients come in like they have. Yeah it really yeah I love that I said so it seems like what you're saying is to find your passion in in your in just in in this industry of what really moves the needle for you is the REALTOR like what what gets you the most excited about the process sort of digging in leaning into that and then continuing to divide. And then you develop skills around whatever that passion might be maybe it's first time home buyer maybe it's maybe it's maybe it's even being with somebody along their apartment journey until they're ready to buy their first home maybe it's being there to guide them or maybe it's I don't like working with those people I only like working with sellers or condos or or co or co ops or whatever it might be single family homes or or people moving from another state I guess whatever it is that you sort of get lit up the most. About is probably an indicator of like oh I really like doing reels you know I really like doing you know or or maybe you're one of those rare people who likes calling expires or fistbos like. Well right this is the thing like it works for people but it's not what they're doing it's it's the energy behind what they're doing it with so if you really love calling strangers and co calling fistbos and you're like I could do this all day. Then it is your indicator that that is your lane and go go crush it you know and so I think that's where we get a little bit scrambled of like we think that there's a certain ways that we have to get business and and then we force ourselves to show up in these ways and I'm like I don't really want to do that I don't really want a cold call I don't really want to sit in open house that feels weird to me or whatever we force ourselves and then we wonder why we're not getting business. And it's because we can it that and now I'm really going to sound new age but like the frequency of that precedes you precedes your words precedes your actions so if something lights you up double down on that do that and let that that excitement and that joy drive what you do after that and then the steps and the choices you start to make and how you show up in your business. I think that's really good advice so before we started talking today or sort of before we started turned on the recording where I was asking you about 2023 because we have I have we have 800 agents or close to 800 agents in our firm you've got a lot of agents obviously Compass has Kelly's a Compass they have thousands of agents here in Chicago Kelly is around a lot of agents I'm around a lot of agents and I'm certainly getting a sense that there's a low level of stress that's that's that's present right now though I feel like there's always stress being a REALTOR but particularly right now it's the end of the year it's the holiday season we're of course we know where rates are we know inventory is is where it is and I know there's a lot of concern about 2023 as I'm hearing it in the ether from other agents but you don't you're not worried about it at all and I really I'm bringing this up because you're the first person I've talked to who doesn't who didn't even break a sweat when I mentioned it so why are you not worried about 2023. Well I think for some of the reasons I've mentioned right I think that I've never let my success be dictated on the circumstances you know I really truly believe that the success that I've seen in my business is because of what I've who I am and what I've done and the skills that I have developed and I think that's where we get a little bit hung up a lot of times when people are stressed it's because they have made their success circumstantial on a low interest rate market or a pandemic and I think some people like there's elements as is there a percentage of my business that was up because of the circumstances sure but would I have still been successful and still done what I've done because of my own sort of like personal power in my myself and my belief in all that absolutely so I truly believe that because I have that outlook it doesn't matter what's going on in the market and and so I'm not worried but I'm also like I'm weirdly excited I think it's great I think this is the market where we get the ability we have the opportunity to make the biggest moves and the biggest growth and secure the most market share and and I fully know that I have the skill set and I have the knowledge and I I have the inspiration to make sure that I'm able to to operate as I want to during this time so I think that yeah. No it's so interesting it's just not even you're not too worried about circumstance you're not worried about sort of the conditions because number one you can't control them so you have to deal with them anyway and number two you started in a dawn market right so you started at you know 2008 to 2010 was not the time to get into real estate and but it was probably such a great time for you because you only knew a difficult challenge and so and you got through it and so then you see maybe maybe the mountain looks a little steeper this next year for a number of reasons outside of our control but you're just I are you just going to pivot if need be and make adjustments and changes and you know you're you're tell me what what you're thinking about well I think that like I mean I'm curious what you mean my pivot but I think that one thing that I talked to my team a lot about is like being aware of the context that we hold for our business right like looking at just next year to me is a very small context I have a 13 year career right there's going to be chapters and even if you've had a three year career this is a chapter of the greater story of the career that you are writing and so if you're so hyper focused on you know the next six months or the next 12 months again it kind of goes back to like you start to inform how you behave and how you show up and it's going to change it if you can just keep a broader context of like we might have a down year next year sure possibly yes do I need to be responsible business owner and start to make some modifications to like our spend and make sure that we're not you know that I'm being smart absolutely I can do those things you know and then we see what happens and we we I don't pull back on investing I still invest in this in in the support that we need and this is the stuff that we know works for us but I think that I have a broader context if you will for for what this will mean in the greater story and so I know everyone's talking about 2023 but I think in my mind I'm already in like 2025 because I can see how this will play in the next few years yes it's a really important point because I think I think you just said something really really big which was I'm thinking about 2025 because 2025 is going to come and we're only thinking about 2023 like you were saying a lot of us are just focused on you know we might be a survival mode or we might be just nervous about but regardless it's going to come and go and we're going to need to adapt and also they're you right there there are cycles and there are ups and downs and life isn't linear businesses and linear and that's that's the the challenge I think for some of us when we get into the business and we have our first five years and it just looks like this linear graph up into the right because we sell more homes every year than we did previously and then maybe all of a sudden the market you know has a correction or you know the there's other factors at play that that affect our ability to keep that trajectory going and it doesn't necessarily mean the end of our business it just means that you know the natural cycle of life there's ups and downs and things that happen but it's it's about really weathering the storm so you were saying like yeah of course as a business owner I'm going to make responsible decisions I'm going to keep my spend in in check and I'm going to make sure that you know my team is getting the resources that they need but we're going to we're going to make it through because I'm already thinking of 2025 see I think that's really interesting I don't know how many people think that way and I think that comes with experience which is which is what you have yeah I think so you know I think I've always had a unique outlook just in general on what we're doing here which is why I tend to just kind of keep my head down and I kind of just do my own thing because I don't I don't want to get to influence if you will by you know by by narratives and opinions and things like that I think that what you touched on about being linear really takes us full circle back to like the whole production and goals and success because we think that like if we do these things we'll get this end result and we can contain it into a whole year when the truth is stuff that you're going to do in 2023 is actually going to pay you in 2025 but we don't let ourselves accept that or see that or measure that because it's not this like tangible thing in front of us right now and so I I always like kind of load this time of year I mean we're speaking it's November it's like everyone should be so excited right now about what we want to do is so excited and we're going to take this. what they did in 2022 and celebrating and go on vacation and don't worry and just like live your life because everyone has worked so hard the last couple years. But I'm watching agents not do it because they're starting to freak out about next year and thinking they have to pull back and they're just like automatically bypassing to me what is the most important component to continued success which is honoring what you've accomplished, celebrating it, sharing it, like sitting in it and knowing that it doesn't end January 1. It carries it carries with you and there's going to be stuff you did this year you never saw the production for that will show up next year or maybe in 2024 or 2025 like we don't know and so I think if I can just share one thing as someone who's been in this business as long as I have now it's like it's never contained to a year ever. It always bleeds over into each other so let's not let's not be so linear and how we measure and and where we begin and end these chapters of the story. Yeah I agree I want to talk about celebration because I that's not something I've really delved into too much in this show and I think it's something that's worth worthwhile to talk about because I think since so many REALTORS are individual practitioners or maybe they are on a team and there is some sort of recognition about you know milestones or certain types of activity gets noticed or appreciated but I do think that it would likely be a good idea for people individually to learn how to celebrate their own achievement and it doesn't necessarily have to be related to a goal that that got hit could be a skill that was learned it could be the way that you know somebody improved their customer service could be a way in which you know something got better or or something new was was brought in. I'm curious how do you recommend to people to celebrate their success because I think we don't we do a lot of it on social media right there's a lot of like look at me I just sold this home I don't I'm not talking about that I'm talking internally processing feeling actually good about something that you accomplish because and the reason I'm making such a big deal of this and I'm going to be in a moment just turn it over to you is I think that can help get us through the hard times if we can remember what it feels like so what are your thoughts on that? Absolutely I love this question and specifically like the this the separation to the external right like social media is a tricky beast and and I think that a lot of people think that they have to celebrate as a form of validation and so there's a little bit in my mind too much ego that gets attached and I think this is what we've all felt right we see the celebration and you're like uh that kind of feels feels like it's a little bit loaded right and it's it's and it's okay we're humans we all have egos there's that moment of wanting to like wave the flag of what you've done and what you've accomplished in a tangible material form but I think that it's it cause that seeing other people do that there's a certain sort of subset of people who like myself who are so turned off from that that I've actually held off on celebrating because I didn't want to come off as a certain way and I didn't want it to feel a certain way because again why I do what I do is so heartfelt and like heart led that the dollars and the goals and or the the celebrations will never really capture all of that right but it I have learned that celebrating is truly the biggest form of expressing your gratitude and I'm I'm really I mean I have my own mentor and that came in light of a conversation I had with her about how how that's really what it is like you're it can be done behind closed doors it can be done with your team it's like what you're asking and so we do a lot of closed doors celebrations like you know we and in our a lot of our goals same thing our personal and production and whatever so we're never just celebrating the medal achieved we're celebrating the whole human and so I do think it's incredibly important to anchor that in for the reason that you said it's something that creates a tangible you know feeling inside of you or recognition for what you've done I would say that I celebrate myself and my accomplishments in in several different ways I think what you were saying for even for me right now this year one of my biggest accomplishments is that I got to spend more time with my daughter and nothing was sacrificed to do it and that has been something I had to learn the hard way and I worked really hard to get at so you know do I have like extra production to show for something no but I have these memories and these experiences with her and and that's something right and and so I as I'm living life I think being very present in my moments of recognizing that I don't have to wait until the end of the year to celebrate that a lot of the time we are we are our goals and our dreams are actually being are actualized in everyday moments yeah but we're just not present enough to see them so I think I have a sense of presence out of just sort of like reverence for celebration in general but I do like to travel that's kind of always been my thing that I feel like traveling gives you this sense of experience and I it's like I sort of hard for me to explain without over talking but like it there's something that really helps me anchor a feeling around a celebration and so I actually tend to use use that but again I know I said a lot I want to encourage people to celebrate because I think that seeing others celebrate helps to give people examples of what's possible and if you're looking for a way to ground yourself in a celebration so it doesn't feel so showy and look at me I always just go to the place of can this provide an example to another female in the industry about what's possible you know five years in your business eight years in your business you know and and kind of be mindful I guess of the narrative with what you're approaching it but yeah the idea of celebration you you really got me thinking I was I was thinking it got me thinking about the for anyone who's ever looked into relationship stuff you probably you know if you have a significant other and you're trying to get along better with them and have a better relationship you probably will stumble across the gotman the gotmans who are who are kind of the the world experts and researchers on how people can can coexist and cohabitate and they've written a million books and there are a married couple thought of I think out of Oregon or Washington anyway but anyway they have they have this ratio that they've proven that for a healthy interpersonal relationship you know romantic relationship the golden ratio is five affirming things for every one sort of negative thing and very critical thing one critical thing so if I want to say oh you know you're doing the dishes the wrong way or whatever or you didn't do the dishes or whatever whatever the criticism might be if you can if you can have five affirming things but here's all the here are the things you did right you know you would sprinkle those throughout the day that's what a healthy relationship and a happy relationship looks like it's five affirming things to everyone one sort of non-affirming thing and what you were saying is really important because you're talking about celebration and I was thinking about that and I was thinking how often do I celebrate myself for the things that I may have accomplished or in our listeners ears what you have accomplished today you definitely did some things well today and I did some things well and I did some things that maybe I could improve on but how often am I even celebrating those little milestones and I used to think you had to get to the end of the goal before you could celebrate but I've learned and I'm curious to get your thoughts I've learned that celebrating along the way it actually keeps keeps the engine running for me it doesn't actually stop the motivation like oh I accomplished it I'm good no because that was kind of my fears I can't can't celebrate until I get to the end and I think that's a mistake because we're talking about celebrating throughout the journey and I think there's a lot of you know you hear about like gratitude groups I don't think we have a gratitude problem I think we have a celebration problem yeah I think we're all I think we're all grateful or if you're not whatever there's there's there's lots of ways to become grateful but I think the bigger issue is around celebrating one's own you know power agency success curious to get to get your thoughts on there yeah no I would agree I think that the celebration somewhere along the way got tainted right and and to your point it's like if we just bring it back to the gratitude and you just can focus on that then then it helps clear the air for a lot of other people to step into their own gratitude so I think we've tangled celebration in gratitude so it's like people aren't even taking a moment to be grateful for what they've done or accomplished because it feels gross and it feels showy or they have were very tangled in that and so I yeah I would agree I think we have more of a celebration problem and to your to your point of you know I think a lot of people wait until the end of the year they wait till they hit the goal but the truth is the goal post literally moves every time like okay I wanted you 20 million dollars I did 20 million dollars and I was like like we did it like okay like it and then the next without if you're not conscious and you're not aware it's automatically 25 before you even like get 20 out of your mouth right and then it's 30 and then it's 35 and all the sudden you're living your life towards this end goal and you're missing all of the moments in between all of the beautiful things that have compounded and compounded that are worth celebrating on the way to this you know this goal and and I also think being present in those moments of yourself and celebrating yourself really helps this to not feel like a winner or lose yeah right if you have a goal and you don't make it then it means you lost if you have a goal and you made it then it means you succeeded and I think that diametrically I don't even know if that's the right word that's what I want to use but like that that sort of like two-dimensional like you winner you lose mentality is what keeps so many people from celebrating because so like why didn't hit my goal well that wasn't the definition of success did you show up every day have you grown have you changed did you help someone you know that's what we should be celebrating well I think that's a wonderful place to sort of wrap up because I this idea of celebration is it is the time of year to celebrate you know we're the holiday season this is time to reflect to be thankful and also to think to the future and and you're already doing that but I think it's in to your point about being increasing the celebration there are I think it would it would be really neat to almost even start like a celebration accountability partner where every week instead of just talking about what you accomplished well in addition to holding each other accountable for things that you want to accomplish which I think is a good idea also having some sort of celebration even if it's just between one to one one person to another hey man great job this week hey so and so you know you even if you didn't necessarily achieve your goal you're still on target you're you're still trying you're still you know this this idea of encouragement really just gets everyone through the hard times and I think I think we're coming up on some some more difficult well it's been difficult to be a REALTOR in the last couple of years I mean I also want to say just because rates were lower didn't make it any easier to be a REALTOR with in fact it you I mean I wasn't out there in the trenches with like you and your team I mean it was hard to be a REALTOR last couple years it was hard and I think that's why my outlook for the next year is very different is because I think that yeah it's it was hard and it was there was a lot of other things we were having to navigate and a lot of certain clients in the market for different reasons and I think that we get again we going to get to decide what this means and I think I'm making this mean that it'll be at a pace that's more sustainable it'll be with you know slightly more favorable outcomes for all clients I think it was very skewed the last you know couple years so again it's just sort of that perspective shift on what we make these markets mean but yeah they haven't they haven't been easy and so I really hope that everybody does celebrate I love what you said actually about an accountability partner because something I've been thinking about and we try to do this we could be better at it is celebrating agents that you don't actually like aren't maybe even in your team I see so many women particularly in these magazines who who accomplish amazing things and I'm like DMing them why isn't this on your Instagram why didn't you talk about this like we're celebrating you I think we the we could lead by example and celebrate each other and congratulate each other without prompt because it really helps I think us all feel a little bit more seen and accepted and encourage to celebrate ourselves so I think that's a great point you know for everyone listening pay attention to the milestones that other people might be hitting people that you like that you respect reach out to them when those milestones happen it might be exactly what they need to hear and they may just be more like Kelly who's like I don't really want to put that out there because maybe I'd seen as show offy and and put it out there for them be proud of of the people that in your community and watch what happens you you're not going to do it for this boomerang reason that it's going to come back to you but it probably will come back to you too this idea of of lifting other other people up you know in their successes oh it's worked well for me I've I've had a similar mentality when I when I see things that happen to people that are very impressive to me I'll often I'll reach out to them and just say like congratulations on on such and such even people I don't know and and I found that in many cases they will say things like you're the only person that reached out to me it doesn't make me a great guy it just makes me the one person who did it and any way he can do that and what I think well what what what comes with that is a lot of times a lot of opportunity ends up coming from that because people will go wow well that's nice that so and so thought about me I'm gonna take a closer look at this this particular individual it's almost very similar to what you do for clients this idea of giving to to giving give give give authentically and then you know you sort of hope that things come back and they do but we should also talk about your team your team is growing you know 2023 is not a scary year for you so if there are anyone who thinks that they would love to work with someone like Kelly and maybe join Chicago Home Collective and learn more about what they offer Kelly what's the best way that our listeners can reach out if

I'm with being a horse but the metaphor is I think okay but I just had to think about that I was like hmm anyway if you want to connect with somebody who's who's really got an interesting philosophy who's been successful and kind of approaches her success a little bit differently but in a way I think that makes just all the sense in the world you know those Chicago home collective might be the team for you so check out Chicago home collective dot com reach out to Kelly slide into her DMs as the young people say although I think that I think that might be like a dating reference so don't do that unless you or maybe do that if you want but reach out to Kelly in any way that you want to she is easy to find and she would love to chat with you and see if you might be a good match to help them grow into 2023 so and 2025 because Kelly looks many many years out it's more headed Kelly thank you on behalf of our audience this is a really fun conversation for me personally I appreciate you for being on our show I've always wanted to have you on and I'm so glad we finally did get you here and hope we can continue to to to get you back on the show from time to time to get your philosophies and thoughts about you know growing a team and and sort of navigating some some difficult times in the business um thank you on behalf of the audience on behalf of Kelly and myself to the audience we want to also say thank you please remember to tell a friend that's the only thing we'll ask of you is just tell one other REALTOR about this episode send them a link over to our website keeping it real pod dot com they can stream every episode we've ever done right from their website or there's pull up a podcast app search for keeping it real and hit that subscribe button we would appreciate it Kelly thank you thank you and thank you it's a great conversation I appreciate it I do I do as well and we will see everybody on the next episode
