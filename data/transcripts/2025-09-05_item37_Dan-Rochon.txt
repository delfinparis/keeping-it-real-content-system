[00:01:20] Are you looking for agents to join your brokerage or team?
[00:01:23] Now, as a real estate recruiter, I can tell you the answer is always yes.
[00:01:28] But most agents aren't looking to move right now.
[00:01:31] So how do you know who to contact?
[00:01:33] Well, what if I were to tell you there's a recruiting and retention tool powered by artificial intelligence
[00:01:37] that shows you exactly which agents in your local market are looking to leave their brokerage right now
[00:01:44] and which agents at your own firm are also looking to leave you?
[00:01:48] Now, I've been recruiting REALTORS for 15 years and I've hired over 2000 agents.

[00:02:02] and shows you which agents they believe are likely to move.
[00:02:06] Not only does it do that, but Corded's AI went and visited my recruiting website
[00:02:11] and read everything I offer.
[00:02:13] So now when I'm recruiting, Corded's AI tells me exactly what to say
[00:02:17] based on that agent's needs and what my brokerage can offer.
[00:02:21] It even writes emails for me.
[00:02:22] I've never seen anything like it and I use it every single day.

[00:03:42] All right, guys, let's get to it.
[00:03:43] My conversation with Dan Rochon.
[00:03:59] What's the best piece of advice you've ever received
[00:04:02] real estate?
[00:04:04] Wow, wow.
[00:04:05] So when I got my license in 2007,
[00:04:09] an agent who I was working with who was mentoring me,
[00:04:14] she shared this piece of advice.
[00:04:15] It was not only, I think the first piece of advice,
[00:04:18] but it also turned out to be the best piece of advice.
[00:04:21] And her name is Garnett.
[00:04:22] And remember, I'll never forget this Garnett told me she says,
[00:04:24] Dan, never, ever, ever, ever, ever,
[00:04:30] leave an appointment without the next appointment set.
[00:04:34] You take out a buyer, you show them homes, and then you say,
[00:04:36] OK, what's next?
[00:04:37] And they say, I'll call you next week.
[00:04:39] Oh, great.
[00:04:40] You'll call me next week.
[00:04:40] What day?
[00:04:41] Maybe Tuesday.
[00:04:42] OK, great.
[00:04:42] If I don't hear from you on Tuesday, I'll give you a call at Wednesday.
[00:04:44] Is that sound good?
[00:04:45] Yeah.
[00:04:46] Should I call you on Wednesday in the afternoon or morning?
[00:04:48] Call me in the afternoon.
[00:04:49] OK, three o'clock.
[00:04:50] That sound good.
[00:04:50] Boom, done.
[00:04:51] So I know I went through that fast, right?
[00:04:53] But that would be the best piece of advice
[00:04:55] is to you never, ever, ever.
[00:04:58] Do you leave an appointment, a conversation,
[00:05:02] without a specific time schedule for you
[00:05:05] to follow up with that person?
[00:05:07] I could not be more of a fan of that particular piece of advice.
[00:05:11] I deploy that in my own life in all sorts of different ways,
[00:05:16] including because of my horrible memory,
[00:05:20] the doctor's appointments I go to with the annual doctor's
[00:05:23] appointments.
[00:05:24] So I have a very specialist or whatever.
[00:05:26] I do not leave that room before the office,
[00:05:31] before scheduling the next year's thing,
[00:05:32] because I will not remember one year from today.
[00:05:35] I won't remember a week from today for my work appointments.
[00:05:38] I certainly won't remember a year from today.
[00:05:40] That is a great piece of advice.
[00:05:42] Do not leave the scene of an appointment
[00:05:44] before scheduling the next appointment.
[00:05:46] Worst piece of advice you've ever received from real estate.
[00:05:49] I'm going to say it pretty general.
[00:05:50] So I know it was specific where maybe it was like a series of advice
[00:05:54] or I was following more than one direction.
[00:05:59] There's been times throughout my career
[00:06:01] where I would follow multiple paths simultaneously.
[00:06:06] I don't know if that was something necessarily
[00:06:08] that one person said to me, Dan,
[00:06:10] you should do 18 different things.
[00:06:13] It was probably more like 18 different people
[00:06:15] said to me one thing and I followed all their advice.
[00:06:19] It left me in a place of overwhelmed distraction,
[00:06:24] inefficiency and tiredness.
[00:06:28] Following more than one strategy at a time
[00:06:31] would be I think bad advice.
[00:06:33] Jack of all trades master of none kind of thing.
[00:06:36] That's right.
[00:06:37] Yeah, much to my chagrin,
[00:06:39] I can only handle about one thing at a time.
[00:06:43] I always say do one thing until it's 80% done
[00:06:47] and then hand it off to somebody else or a system.
[00:06:51] And then once you're able to do that,
[00:06:53] then you're able to take on the next task.
[00:06:56] But it's got to be at least 80% done before you move on.
[00:07:00] This is why we have Dan on the show.
[00:07:02] Dan Rochon is our guest today.
[00:07:04] He is the creator of the Teach to Sell system
[00:07:07] and founder of the CPI community
[00:07:10] after going from broke and stuck to building a consistently
[00:07:14] profitable real estate business,
[00:07:15] Dan has helped hundreds of agents
[00:07:17] and entrepreneurs achieve no broke months
[00:07:19] by mastering influence,
[00:07:21] neural linguistic programming,
[00:07:23] and story driven sales.
[00:07:26] First of all, I want everybody to visit Dan's website
[00:07:29] which is nobrokemonths.com.
[00:07:31] You can learn about all things Dan.
[00:07:32] He's a coach, he's an author,
[00:07:34] he's got a book coming out.
[00:07:36] I just call Teach to Sell,
[00:07:38] published by Simon and Schuster.
[00:07:39] That is a huge feather in Dan's cap.
[00:07:42] Simon and Schuster is at the very, very top
[00:07:44] of the literary publishing field.
[00:07:46] So this is a big deal.
[00:07:48] Dan is a big deal.
[00:07:48] We're happy to have him on the show, Dan.
[00:07:50] Welcome.
[00:07:51] Thank you.
[00:07:52] I appreciate to welcome.
[00:07:53] Appreciate you being here.
[00:07:55] Let's start at the beginning.
[00:07:57] Before you became the Dan that we
[00:08:00] that were about to learn,
[00:08:03] want to learn how about how you came to get into real estate.
[00:08:07] So tell us that story.
[00:08:09] Sure.
[00:08:11] So 2005,
[00:08:14] I was waiting tables at one of the
[00:08:18] one of the top real estate,
[00:08:20] real estate, where am I going with this.
[00:08:22] And one of the top stake houses in the entire planet.
[00:08:25] And I was waiting tables there.
[00:08:27] And I was making a ton of money.
[00:08:31] It was really, you know,
[00:08:32] well-known establishment one that all
[00:08:34] the celebrities would come to is in Washington DC.
[00:08:37] And I'm talking senators and lobbies and presidents
[00:08:40] and movie stars and athletes.
[00:08:43] You know, it was great, you know,
[00:08:45] but I freaking hated my job.
[00:08:48] Like I didn't like doing it.
[00:08:50] And, you know, I was at the time around 30 years older.
[00:08:54] So I was also simultaneously struggling with
[00:08:58] with my alcoholic addiction.
[00:09:01] And, you know,
[00:09:02] I'll call it have been come an escape for me around the age of 13
[00:09:06] until it became a cage around, you know, the age of 32.
[00:09:10] And that's when, you know,
[00:09:11] my friend Dave and Dave,
[00:09:15] you know, he didn't, he didn't, you know,
[00:09:17] tried to talk me into something.
[00:09:19] He didn't make me wrong.
[00:09:20] He listened.
[00:09:22] He connected with me.
[00:09:23] He asked me questions.
[00:09:25] And, you know,
[00:09:25] and he helped me to be able to, you know,
[00:09:27] choose a better life.
[00:09:28] And, you know, as a result of that,
[00:09:29] I became sober.
[00:09:30] And I'm really grateful for Dave for that.
[00:09:33] And the unfortunate piece of that story
[00:09:38] was a couple of years later,
[00:09:41] Dave, he died
[00:09:44] as a result of his addiction.
[00:09:46] And, you know, he was able to, you know,
[00:09:49] he was able to help me
[00:09:49] and unfortunately,
[00:09:50] he wasn't able to help himself.
[00:09:52] And, you know,
[00:09:53] I'm forever grateful for that relationship.
[00:09:56] And, you know,
[00:09:57] regretful I was unable to,
[00:09:59] you know, help him in return.
[00:10:00] But nonetheless, I,
[00:10:02] you know, I was at that place in my life
[00:10:04] where I was sort of out of crossroads of,
[00:10:06] you know, what do I do?
[00:10:08] And I knew I wanted to be
[00:10:09] an entrepreneur.
[00:10:10] I knew I wanted to help people
[00:10:12] solve their problems, achieve their goals.
[00:10:13] But I just,
[00:10:14] I was waiting tables.
[00:10:15] I didn't know how.
[00:10:17] And one day,
[00:10:17] you know, when my buddy said to me,
[00:10:19] hey,
[00:10:20] Rochanne,
[00:10:20] I'd be able to consider, you know,
[00:10:23] real estate sales.
[00:10:24] And I had it at the time.
[00:10:25] I had done some investing,
[00:10:26] some fixed flips,
[00:10:27] some wholesale,
[00:10:28] all kinds of different,
[00:10:29] you know, crazy stuff.
[00:10:30] And I said, yeah, you know,
[00:10:32] let me check this out.
[00:10:32] And I found out that it was a 60-hour course work.
[00:10:35] It was a few thousand dollars to get started.
[00:10:39] And, you know,
[00:10:40] and there was no upper limits of it.
[00:10:42] You know, it was just, you know,
[00:10:43] based off of,
[00:10:44] you know, whatever you're going to put into this,
[00:10:46] what you're going to get out of it.
[00:10:47] So it seemed to me like a pathway to,
[00:10:50] it seemed to me like a pathway to be able
[00:10:52] to become an entrepreneur,
[00:10:53] to become a salesperson.
[00:10:55] And to really create
[00:10:56] a design-mounted life.
[00:10:57] And that's how I got started.
[00:10:59] Wow, what a story.
[00:11:01] What a story.
[00:11:02] So, yeah, Dan,
[00:11:03] appreciate you sharing
[00:11:04] being vulnerable and talking about
[00:11:06] some of the missteps along the way
[00:11:08] or the challenges.
[00:11:10] We all have them.
[00:11:12] And I have always
[00:11:14] been so impressed throughout my life
[00:11:16] when I see people go from addiction to sobriety.
[00:11:20] It is, it is a marvelous transformation.
[00:11:23] Almost everybody,
[00:11:24] if they follow the path
[00:11:26] as it is laid out before them,
[00:11:28] turns into just a wonderful human being.
[00:11:31] It is just incredible.
[00:11:32] And they become more productive.
[00:11:34] And you obviously are a shining example of that work.
[00:11:38] So congratulations to you
[00:11:40] and all of the success you've had since.
[00:11:43] So let's talk a little bit about
[00:11:46] got into real estate.
[00:11:48] So you were already working
[00:11:51] at the sort of highest part of
[00:11:54] the highest peak of the mountain
[00:11:56] as a server in Washington.
[00:12:00] You know, this is a high-end stake house.
[00:12:02] This is not
[00:12:06] an easy gig to get.
[00:12:08] So you knew how to be around people.
[00:12:11] You knew customer service.
[00:12:13] You certainly were
[00:12:15] affable enough.
[00:12:17] So how did you make that transition into sales?
[00:12:22] Well, you're right.
[00:12:23] And I would say I was definitely
[00:12:25] a salesperson as a waiter.
[00:12:28] And I look at that as my training.
[00:12:30] I looked at it as my training
[00:12:31] in regards to how to be able to
[00:12:33] manage multiple things simultaneously.
[00:12:37] You know, and to be able to sort of process,
[00:12:39] you know, in real estate sales, there's, you know,
[00:12:42] if you do a high, if you do enough volume,
[00:12:44] there's always pieces that are moving around.
[00:12:47] There's always challenges.
[00:12:49] There's, you know, different timelines.
[00:12:51] There's, you got prospects.
[00:12:52] In one hand, you got clients.
[00:12:54] In the other hand, you got, you know,
[00:12:55] aftercare.
[00:12:56] And there's so many different moving parts.
[00:12:58] But I would say that it was really,
[00:13:02] for me, it was understanding
[00:13:04] that what I learned as a waiter,
[00:13:07] you know, working with, you know,
[00:13:10] there was one day I was waiting out four tables.
[00:13:12] And in one of the tables, I had a,
[00:13:14] I had Eli Manning, Arch Manning,
[00:13:18] I washington Redskins at the time,
[00:13:21] a trainer and I think it was,
[00:13:24] it was like Arch Manning's wife.
[00:13:26] So Arch would be, you may have heard of like Archie Manning,
[00:13:29] who's like the guy, this would be his grandfather.
[00:13:32] And so, all right, so that's in one table.
[00:13:34] Another table I had John Kerry,
[00:13:36] who was a secretary of state and also
[00:13:40] as a United States Senator.
[00:13:42] And in the other table I had,
[00:13:44] I forget his name, but he was a Supreme Court justice.
[00:13:48] At the same time, I have a fourth table.
[00:13:51] And these tables are in bankets.
[00:13:53] So they're back to back to back.
[00:13:54] And so I'm in the fourth table,
[00:13:56] these two, there was these three guys
[00:13:58] and two of them were giving me a hard time.
[00:13:59] And they, I will never remember this,
[00:14:01] I'll never forget this rather.
[00:14:03] These guys are giving me a hard time
[00:14:04] and they're saying nobody famous ever comes in here.
[00:14:09] Exactly.
[00:14:10] 
[00:14:10] I'm like, okay.
[00:14:11] No sweat, no sweat.
[00:14:13] And if you don't know, the Manning's are there.
[00:14:15] They are football players, just,
[00:14:16] who your listeners in on that.
[00:14:18] And so anyways, the point being is,
[00:14:21] I learned, you know, by working with these celebrities
[00:14:25] on a regular basis that human beings are spiritual beings
[00:14:31] manifested in this human condition.
[00:14:33] And it doesn't matter if you're at that level of celebrity
[00:14:38] or if you're at the place of, you know,
[00:14:40] I'd be walking to my car at the end of the night.
[00:14:42] And I'm, you know, given, you know,
[00:14:44] some homeless people, the bread from the bread warmer,
[00:14:47] you know, because it would go stale.
[00:14:49] And I would take a bag of it and give it to them
[00:14:50] on my way home or my way to the car.
[00:14:53] What I realize is that as spiritual beings,
[00:14:57] no matter where we are in life,
[00:14:58] we all want the same things.
[00:15:00] And we want to be loved, we want to be cared for,
[00:15:02] we want to feel that we're worthy.
[00:15:05] And we want to be able to,
[00:15:07] we want to be able to have relationship and happiness.
[00:15:10] And so as I recognize that in that realm,
[00:15:13] and then I became a real estate sales person
[00:15:15] to go back to your questions like,
[00:15:17] how'd you make the transition?
[00:15:18] Well, it wasn't really such a transition.
[00:15:22] It was, you know, there's a new tactics that I had to learn.
[00:15:24] There's new techniques.
[00:15:25] There's new things I had to learn.
[00:15:27] I had to learn the technical things of real estate sales.
[00:15:30] But ultimately, understanding who we are
[00:15:34] and understanding what's important to us
[00:15:36] and what's vital to us.
[00:15:37] Again, whether if you're a United States senator
[00:15:39] or Supreme Court justice or a football star,
[00:15:43] whoever, we all want the same thing.
[00:15:46] And if you go back to sales,
[00:15:48] it's, you know, it's not sales isn't about pushing.
[00:15:51] Sales is about leading.
[00:15:53] And if you're struggling in sales,
[00:15:56] you're probably doing it wrong.
[00:15:59] Right? So when I took on the,
[00:16:02] the knowledge is say,
[00:16:04] my job as a sales professional
[00:16:07] isn't to push things on to people.
[00:16:09] It is to be in rapport with them,
[00:16:12] connect with them energetically.
[00:16:14] It's to ask them a debt questions
[00:16:17] to deeply understand what their desires are
[00:16:20] and not just the technical stuff
[00:16:22] but also the emotional stuff.
[00:16:24] And then it's to actively listen to them
[00:16:27] at a deep, deep level,
[00:16:29] not in a place where I'm listening to the words,
[00:16:31] but in a place where I'm listening to the energy.
[00:16:34] And so I would say that it was less of a transition
[00:16:38] from one field to the other
[00:16:39] and more of a progression of
[00:16:42] just learning how to be able to navigate
[00:16:44] through human beings and spiritual beings
[00:16:46] in one realm, into another.
[00:16:49] And, you know, and that was my experience through it.
[00:16:52] Yeah, I love that.
[00:16:53] I'm hearing a lot of talk about connection.
[00:16:57] So we're talking about communication,
[00:16:59] connection, and that we want to be around people
[00:17:05] that we feel connected to
[00:17:08] and people want, feel connected to us
[00:17:10] are more likely to want to utilize our services,
[00:17:14] buy our products, and just spend time with us
[00:17:18] in relationship, as you said.
[00:17:20] So what we're really talking about today
[00:17:22] is not so much specifically about real estate
[00:17:26] although that is what we do here
[00:17:29] is really talking about what underlies the
[00:17:33] the sort of the deal itself, which is a relationship,
[00:17:38] which is connection.
[00:17:40] So I am super interested, Dan, in talking about that
[00:17:43] with you because I believe that if you can increase those skills
[00:17:48] and obviously you believe this is well because you teach it,
[00:17:52] if you can increase your abilities to connect with others,
[00:17:56] you will improve your business.
[00:17:58] You will get those ancillary rewards.
[00:18:02] But there are some skills to learn.
[00:18:05] There are some things that we weren't taught
[00:18:07] from our parents or from our schools.
[00:18:10] So I want to get into that.
[00:18:13] But yeah, let's talk about it.
[00:18:14] Talk about communication.
[00:18:17] Communication is the response that you get.
[00:18:21] And you know what I'm going to,
[00:18:23] I'm going to pause to as Dan just said something,
[00:18:26] utterly profound.
[00:18:28] He didn't say communication is one person trying to
[00:18:33] give some sort of information to another person.
[00:18:36] Dan said something really, really smart.
[00:18:40] I'm sorry, Dan, I'm causing you because I know what you said
[00:18:43] and what you said I want all of our listeners to hear.
[00:18:47] He said communication is the response you get.
[00:18:51] So what Dan's really saying is communication is
[00:18:54] your skill level to achieve what you want from the other,
[00:19:00] it's the feedback loop that you're getting.
[00:19:02] Dan, thank you for that.
[00:19:03] You're welcome.
[00:19:04] And thank you, DJ, for interrupting me on that.
[00:19:06] I mean, because it was or interjecting
[00:19:08] around the night interrupting.
[00:19:09] But thank you for interjecting.
[00:19:10] I was an interruption.
[00:19:14] It's like interrupting Kyle.
[00:19:15] I was a bad bad bad joke, you know, knock knock.
[00:19:20] Come on.
[00:19:21] Who's there interrupting Kyle?
[00:19:23] An arctic guy.
[00:19:24] 
[00:19:25] Yeah, right.
[00:19:26] It's a great one.
[00:19:27] You don't want to go that direction.
[00:19:28] All right, we'll go back to the communication.
[00:19:30] Communication is the response that you get.
[00:19:33] And so what that means is that when you take on the responsibility of
[00:19:41] the result of the communication,
[00:19:44] then that puts the that puts it on you.
[00:19:49] And so it takes away the ability to be able to say like a buyer or a seller, for example,
[00:19:55] like, you know, I remember, and I think they still say it, but you know, buyers are liars,
[00:20:00] you know, and all these cliches that are just horrible.
[00:20:03] And it's like, no, it's it's it's it's when you don't take on the responsibility of
[00:20:10] of the result of your communication, then it allows for you to get lazy and allows for
[00:20:15] you to have excuses to be ineffective.
[00:20:17] When you say to yourself, whatever result that I get, I'm responsible for that.
[00:20:25] Then what happens is that you elevate your results extraordinarily.
[00:20:31] Now it's easy to say, well, what about the other person?
[00:20:34] Okay, well, guess what?
[00:20:35] They're also responsible.
[00:20:37] But guess what?
[00:20:38] Between you and the other person, there's only one of them that you have any say in.
[00:20:44] And that's you.
[00:20:46] And so that's the that's my definition of communication.
[00:20:49] It is a perfect definition.
[00:20:52] And I love that you really, really walk through that because that is so important for us to
[00:20:57] realize that communication isn't our intent, right? So Dan didn't say it's our intention,
[00:21:04] because oftentimes we intend to communicate something to someone and it doesn't get the result
[00:21:12] we want. They don't understand. They didn't believe you or for whatever reason,
[00:21:17] it didn't get communicated correctly. And we blame them.
[00:21:21] And Dan would say, okay, well, yes, they have a responsibility to process the information.
[00:21:27] However, I'm the one that delivered the information. So how do I re-deliver that information?
[00:21:33] How do I deliver it more elegantly? How do I deliver it in a way that they want to,
[00:21:39] or a way that they process information that they want to hear it? So this is what we're talking
[00:21:45] about. And I know we're getting really granular with communication, but it's so important.
[00:21:50] Because if you can kind of grasp this concept, as Dan said, this exponential growth happens,
[00:21:57] because you will start talking to people in the way they want to be talked to, not the way you
[00:22:03] want to be talked to. I love that DJ. Let me give you, let me give the actual like the science
[00:22:08] behind it. And I go and teach in the book, teach yourself why top performers never saw
[00:22:13] what they do instead. I go through this and it's called the self-coaching model.
[00:22:17] And what the self-coaching model is, is if you're not driving right now and you're at home,
[00:22:23] get out a piece of paper and a pen. And if you could, just we're going to draw a clock.
[00:22:28] And at that new and a clock, the 12 o'clock position, we're going to write down the word
[00:22:32] circumstance. All right, so we'll talk about that here for a second. So there's circumstance,
[00:22:37] something happens. And you observe that circumstance through your five senses.
[00:22:44] And then based off if your education, your background, your experience and life,
[00:22:51] you assign meaning to whatever it is that is happening. And then if you're drawing, if you're
[00:22:58] along with me around the two o'clock position, write down the word thought. Okay, so the circumstance
[00:23:06] that you observe through your senses, you then have a thought about them. And then if you go,
[00:23:13] if you're if you write down around the five o'clock position, the word feeling, now you're going
[00:23:18] to have a feeling about it. All right, so now what I just described so far, that's your life.
[00:23:24] That is your life right there. Now we're going to go a little bit further from this.
[00:23:28] We're now going to go over to the seven o'clock position. We're going to write down the word
[00:23:34] action. And then around the 10 o'clock position, that you do the word result. And so I'll go through
[00:23:38] all this again for you. So you have the circumstance at the new position, at the two o'clock position,
[00:23:44] you have thought at the five o'clock position, you have feeling, at the seven o'clock position,
[00:23:51] you have action and at the 10 o'clock position, you have result. And then you draw an arrow that's
[00:23:56] going clockwise between each of those. And what you just did there was you see that you have a closed
[00:24:02] loop of that's your life. Now how's that relate to communication? Because if you look at that gap
[00:24:09] in between the circumstance and the thought that circumstance is is fed from your experiences,
[00:24:17] from your from your education, your culture, your background, your upbringing, etc. And then we're
[00:24:24] going to throw something else on here. You go through some filtering, generalizations,
[00:24:29] deletions and distortions. So generalizations, deletions and distortions are communication styles,
[00:24:34] which are get the book and I explain it to you in the book. It's a little bit more complicated
[00:24:38] than what I believe I can do it right here. But the for the for the lack of a better term,
[00:24:44] it's it's the way that we process. And sometimes we leave pieces out and sometimes we add pieces.
[00:24:50] Sometimes we generalize like there's a president that will say sometimes everybody agrees with me.
[00:24:57] Well, that's a that's a broad generalization. Who's everybody?
[00:25:01] Okay. And you know, and I'm not picking on, you know, I'm not going to get into the political
[00:25:05] stream, right? But any well-crafted politician is effective in that communication to let you
[00:25:13] believe that they're talking to you and your needs. And they're doing so in a way, they're
[00:25:18] communicating a way that they're generalizing so that you can put what you want in there.
[00:25:22] So anyway, so what I just described to you is the self-coaching model. And I go through that
[00:25:27] in more depth in the book. But this is how we communicate and how we get results. And since I'm
[00:25:35] here, and this isn't about communication, but if you want to hack what we what we just went through,
[00:25:40] you could do so through feeding your subconscious, through things like visualizations,
[00:25:47] affirmations, reading, relationships, prayer, exercise. And there's different ways that you can
[00:25:54] you can program yourself to get out of that closed loop because what we just did was we did a
[00:25:59] clock with a closed loop. And that's why we did it like that to demonstrate to you that the
[00:26:04] that our lives are are cyclical, which is why you so often get the same results over and over
[00:26:11] and over and over again throughout your life. Yeah, we're talking about breaking patterns. And
[00:26:16] Dan said it very, very effectively there was that we have this loop, this loop around the way
[00:26:24] we experience the world. And this loop in his analogy sort of goes via a clock.
[00:26:34] Hand and it goes around, but it goes around without much intention without much conscious
[00:26:40] realization. And what Dan teaches you how to do is how to slow down those the the clock hand
[00:26:48] so that you can intentionally make decisions around what you feel, what you think, what you
[00:26:55] how you react. Because if you are in the driver's seat, you get to decide about how you show up.
[00:27:03] And that's really important for REALTORS, right? We as you said, Dan, you know, REALTORS are constantly
[00:27:09] under just a constant stream of emails, texts, phone calls, things go wrong. There's a constant
[00:27:20] barrage of information that's coming to them. Some that will throw them off their game. And a
[00:27:27] REALTOR really needs to be able to be mindful and able to to regulate in this way so that when
[00:27:37] these situations happen, the client, they might be very reactive. But the REALTOR now understands,
[00:27:45] okay, I am going to choose how I respond to this versus this is how I am responding to this.
[00:27:53] In other words, my default is this, but I may choose a different path. This is the essence of what
[00:28:00] Dan teaches. It's intention. How do I create intention around my action, my communication,
[00:28:09] and my skill? That's right, DJ. And right now, I believe it's more important than ever before,
[00:28:17] because that influence gap, it's everywhere. It's between leaders and teams. It's between family
[00:28:24] members, it's in politics. And with artificial intelligence, shape in the way that we see the world,
[00:28:31] what we read, there's so many things that, you know, with artificial intelligence, big data,
[00:28:39] technology, but AI, it can produce perfect information, but what it can't do is it can't see you.
[00:28:46] It can't look you in the eyes and know who you are. Technology can produce, you know, incredible
[00:28:53] information, but it can't cross that human threshold of connectivity. And as the world has
[00:29:02] changed, and it's changing out of velocity that I can not even describe, because not too long ago,
[00:29:08] when I first started being, yeah, I've been coaching agents for, I owned a real estate broker for
[00:29:12] 10 years, and I had 150 agents who worked for me, so I coach agents then, but I started coaching
[00:29:17] real estate agents around maybe seven years ago. And when I started coaching agents, I would talk
[00:29:22] about technology, big data and AI. And when I got to AI, people were like, oh, yeah, that's the future.
[00:29:30] Okay, this hasn't been that long. And when you look at the speed of how this stuff's being developed,
[00:29:41] why your ability to communicate matters today more than ever before is because it's hard today to
[00:29:51] even distinguish between real and fake. So you've got to be able to master these skills to be
[00:30:01] able to thrive if you want to survive. And when you do, then you're going to be able to really,
[00:30:09] you know, to be able to serve at a high level. Tell us how do we start that process?
[00:30:16] It's about understanding to be able to start the process is about being unwind, understand
[00:30:21] the basic, you know, let me walk you through an exercise. So think back, think about your favorite
[00:30:31] teacher, your favorite coach, your favorite guide. And if you're listening to this right now,
[00:30:40] and if you can, close your eyes for a moment, think back, see their face, hear their voice,
[00:30:51] feel the way that you felt when they believed in you.
[00:30:58] Now, open your eyes and imagine that that person walked into your life today and they gave you advice.
[00:31:07] You probably follow it, right?
[00:31:09] 100% I feel great right now. Thinking about that teacher who believed in me.
[00:31:13] Yeah, because they earned your trust.
[00:31:15] Yep.
[00:31:17] So DJ to answer your question, where do you start? Well, the starting point is just understanding
[00:31:24] how it feels like if you just did a DJ and if you're, you know, listening to this on, you know,
[00:31:30] on YouTube or wherever you're listening to this right now on your podcast. And if you did that as
[00:31:35] well, then you just had the experience of, yeah, I remember Mr. Smith or Miss Bobbitt or whoever
[00:31:39] the case may be. And I remember how she made me feel. And yeah, if she came in the room right now,
[00:31:46] and gave me some advice, I would follow that. Well, that's a demonstration of they didn't
[00:31:52] teach you algebra or history. They believed in you, right? They were probably there when you were
[00:31:58] struggling with a challenging relationship or, you know, you'd be in May fun of at school or maybe
[00:32:05] you're in a new school and you had no friends or whatever the case may be. And they earned your
[00:32:11] trust. So if we can understand that this is the way that we communicate at levels, that's the
[00:32:16] starting point. Just just having awareness of it. And now that you have an awareness of it,
[00:32:21] you can now choose moving forward to say, well, will I be that guy? Will I be that mentor,
[00:32:30] that coach, that teacher? And however many years ago it was that, you know, from that person that
[00:32:38] you were, you know, remembering, it was probably a really long time ago. And they made an impact
[00:32:45] that you remember them today. So now that you understand the power of being able to be, you know,
[00:32:54] to teach the cell, now that's the starting point. And now you can be able to, to be able to connect
[00:33:01] with people with other people at a, you know, at a full level, right? Because the connection starts
[00:33:08] when, when the other person knows that you care and when you listen.
[00:33:12] Yeah, let's, let's talk about, thank you, Dan. That's welcome. Really great. Let's talk about
[00:33:19] what do you do? So let's start with what are some of the practices, the exercises, the behaviors
[00:33:28] that agents can start doing to really understand by teaching that is really the pathway to sales.
[00:33:37] Yeah. It's not just, so there's a couple different ways here, DJ. So first of all, we, we, we use it
[00:33:43] in our marketing. Secondly, we use it in our client care. Okay. So it's not just to be able to get
[00:33:50] clients, but it's also to be able to serve clients so that they, that you build a bigger trust with
[00:33:54] them. Let me give you a specific example for real estate agent specifically. You're working with a buyer.
[00:34:00] Have you ever had this, Mr. Mrs. Real Estate agent, a buyer that went to the home inspection.
[00:34:06] And they came up with 172 things for you to negotiate. Probably happen to you if you listen to this.
[00:34:15] If that happened to you, then what do you do? You try to tell them, hey, you know, this is unreasonable.
[00:34:23] You try to convince them into understanding, you know, that that it's going to make things go
[00:34:28] really, really bad. You may lose a deal and it's just going to be, you know, not ideal.
[00:34:33] Of course, you want to, you want to protect their interests and you want to, you know, be a fiduciary
[00:34:37] and protect them, of course, right? But there's sometimes where things go like maybe a little bit
[00:34:42] further than what would be in their best interests. Yes. So the way that most agents do is they go
[00:34:48] through that and then they go and have a conversation with their broker and say, Mr. Mrs. Broker, what should
[00:34:52] I do here? And you're reactive. Why don't we do this differently? Instead, when you're consulting the
[00:34:58] buyer upfront, when you are consulting the buyer, have a conversation that looks up to like this.
[00:35:07] Mr. buyer, the day that we write it off for the gets accepted, you're going to go home, you're
[00:35:13] going to toss and turn. You may even have an argument with your spouse. You may be at odds with
[00:35:19] each other. You're going to, you're going to have a sleepless night. You're going to be second
[00:35:25] gassing. You're going to wake up in the morning. Your sister's going to send you a text. He's
[00:35:28] going to say, you're a freaking idiot for buying with the interest rate to where they are right now.
[00:35:33] Okay. And then three days later, you're going to do a home inspection. The home inspector's going
[00:35:38] to come in. He's going to give you 100 things that are wrong with that home. Now remember, Mr.
[00:35:45] buyer, you're at the place right now where you are emotionally charged. You have some buyers or
[00:35:51] more. You're uncertain about your decisions. You're making a half a million dollar purchase.
[00:35:58] And now somebody's telling you that all this stuff wrong with this with this home.
[00:36:04] Well, remember, Mr. buyer, if we get that situation in the in the process, it's perfectly normal.
[00:36:11] What I recommend is if that happens is that we protect you, the big ticket items, the things
[00:36:17] that are going to take cost you money, the HVAC, the plumbing, the electrical, etc.
[00:36:22] that we make sure that those are fixed and that those are in good repair and the things that
[00:36:26] may cost you $25 to fix. Maybe we don't even pay attention to that. And that window that's frosted,
[00:36:34] it's frosted today. The day that we're writing the offer, they're going to get accepted.
[00:36:38] It's still going to be frosted on Thursday when we do the home inspection. So if that's something
[00:36:44] that's of a concern to you, then maybe we should go find a different home because it is what it is.
[00:36:50] And so when you consult them up front of the predictable problems, that's one example of how
[00:36:55] you can do so. Now if that client goes through that experience, how are they looking at you when
[00:37:04] they go and they have that sleep with night? Yeah, they go, well, Dan told me this is what was going to
[00:37:11] happen. Dan really knows his stuff. I am having some quandary. Dan told me it's not
[00:37:22] worry about it because the next day we're going to go through this, we're going to figure it out,
[00:37:26] we're going to determine what's important. Dan, I will tell you, we're using this example.
[00:37:33] If anyone's thinking, I don't know how useful this would be, it would have been incredibly useful
[00:37:40] for me when I bought my last condo because I'm in the business. I'm a, you know, I'm technically
[00:37:47] a real estate agent. I don't practice, but I have a license and I was making the largest financial
[00:37:52] decision of my life, purchasing and I the night before, I wish somebody had said, by the way,
[00:37:57] the night before you're going to think I'm making the worst decision I've ever made in my life.
[00:38:01] By the way, I've bought before, by the way, it's not like this was my first purchase. So I'm
[00:38:06] really telling on myself, but the truth is the night before you, I almost fell over. I was so,
[00:38:13] I was so scared and I was so upset with myself and I was just a miserable person to be around
[00:38:20] and I wish, I just wish somebody would have been able to guide me through that in advance.
[00:38:27] Say, hey, DJ, here's what's going to happen the night before. You're going to probably freak out.
[00:38:31] Dan said it was exactly what I experienced. So I love the fact, Dan, that you're teaching people
[00:38:38] how to cope ahead and how to just predict the future, how to know that this experience is coming
[00:38:47] so that it doesn't have the same power that it might, that it did for me that night.
[00:38:52] Yeah, the difference, the difference being is the same thing happens. I can't change what's
[00:38:57] going to happen. Right. What I can change is when it does happen, the difference between my clients
[00:39:03] perception of me being a true professional versus an idiot. Same thing happens. Nothing different
[00:39:13] happens. The homeless factory either way comes and says there's a hundred things wrong with this
[00:39:16] property, but the difference is is when you, when you, you, you set them up front to, to, to,
[00:39:25] to expect that this is what's going to happen. Now that, that trust is gained and it still doesn't
[00:39:31] alleviate some of the fear or whatever the case may be, but it makes it feel more natural.
[00:39:36] And now just imagine how many more transactions you can do so that instead of being reactive
[00:39:42] and going to your broker, saying, Mr. Broker, what do I do here? And by the way, I learned all these
[00:39:46] systems when I was the broker. Right. I was the broker and, you know, by Tuesday, I've had,
[00:39:54] you know, 20 agents come up to me with the same problem. Like, you know, maybe there's a better way
[00:39:59] we can do this. Maybe instead of being reactive, it's fixing all the problems. Maybe we've
[00:40:06] got to identify what are all the problems and whatever the problems are. Now let's, let's say,
[00:40:11] let's consult them upfront before we get there. And that's, that's where teachers that was born.
[00:40:19] You know, I love that because buying a home or selling a home is such an emotionally
[00:40:23] charged decision. It runs the gamut. It prays upon fear and anger and sadness and all of our deepest
[00:40:33] emotions and, and also pricing, right. We have to figure out pricing. And all of it is just,
[00:40:39] it's heavy stuff. This is heavy, heavy stuff. And we oftentimes forget his real estate professionals,
[00:40:47] just what that emotional load is on the client. And if they don't know it's coming, if they don't
[00:40:54] know what's ahead of them, they're going to get hit by it. And it's going to be even more powerful.
[00:41:01] But as Dan said, you can teach, coach them through it. You can actually help them before,
[00:41:09] before it happens and give them guidance about, and also, you know, what it does really is,
[00:41:17] establishes you as the expert. Yeah, because you're like, oh, I know this thing. I've done this
[00:41:22] a million times. Here's what's going to happen. And you know, it's funny. I love every so often,
[00:41:28] I'll go to a restaurant and a waitress will come over and she'll say, it's very rare. But when it
[00:41:33] happens, I love it, they'll say, now look, when you start looking at the menu, we have a lot of
[00:41:38] stuff on here. Don't get overwhelmed. If you get overwhelmed, I'm going to guide you through it.
[00:41:43] Don't worry. And it's very rare when this happens, but I love what it happens. And then I just go,
[00:41:47] okay, what should I be looking at? Right? So we're talking about a version of that here.
[00:41:54] So again, all the way back to communication, how do you help people through? Because people can
[00:42:02] buy a home on their own, really, they don't really need you to purchase a property. What they need
[00:42:07] you to do is to help them through all of the ups and downs of the transaction. And so Dan's
[00:42:15] process with Teach to Sell is about how to effectively communicate in a way that meets their
[00:42:22] emotional needs, how to more effectively connect with them intimately so that you have the ability to
[00:42:31] even understand their thought patterns the way they interpret the world. And then you can then
[00:42:39] present solutions specific to the way that they are experiencing reality.
[00:42:46] That's right, DJ. And it's about understanding how other people have perceived the world.
[00:42:51] That goes back to some of the things that I shared with you before. I've got an opportunity,
[00:42:56] advantage in my marketplace that, you know, I'm in the Washington DC, I'm in North of Virginia.
[00:43:04] And so it is a very diverse marketplace, which means that any given transaction that whoever
[00:43:17] I'm communicating with probably has different upbringing than me probably looks different than I do,
[00:43:23] probably has a different education, different culture, different background, different ethnicity,
[00:43:29] because I'm literally in a melting pot. Now I love that. And at the same time, it also presents,
[00:43:37] I mean, you've got to stay sharp. You've got to be aware, right? You've got to be ready to be able
[00:43:43] to understand that the person who you're communicating with has a very different worldview,
[00:43:54] or likely has a very different worldview than I do, because they do.
[00:44:00] They grew up in a different country or a different culture, whatever the case may be.
[00:44:05] So what do you do when you, because you're absolutely right, a lot of us find that we work well
[00:44:14] with a certain type of client who's most similar to us, and we want to expand that reach to be able to
[00:44:21] connect with others that are more dissimilar. So what should they do to start considering
[00:44:29] bridging that gap? Bridging the gap of how to communicate or how to tell me more about the question.
[00:44:37] Yeah, so we were talking about having clients that are very different from us, right?
[00:44:44] So, and learning about their specific needs and what their values are. So you're in a situation where
[00:44:53] you have your in Virginia, you have a very diverse population, you have people coming to you that
[00:44:59] are very different from one another. These are not homogenous, it's not a homogenous culture. So you
[00:45:05] have all these different experiences, beliefs, behaviors, perceptions, and expectations. So how do
[00:45:12] you navigate through that? Yeah, so one of the things when I went through the CPI communication
[00:45:16] model earlier, the last part that reminds you is number one is connect energetically, number two,
[00:45:22] is to ask a depth questions, and number three is to actively listen. So two actively listen means
[00:45:28] that you're paying attention to their energy, you're paying attention to their spiritual being.
[00:45:33] And so regardless of what their background or beliefs and their, you know, the way of their being
[00:45:40] is, we still have commonalities. No matter where you're born in the world, we have commonalities,
[00:45:47] right? So it's not that hard to sit there and say, hey, let me be grounded. Let me stop,
[00:45:55] and let me just pay attention. Let me listen. Let me, let me observe. Let me connect with who I'm talking
[00:46:05] with. Because now when I can do that, now I can observe. And now I can also not just observe,
[00:46:13] but I can find commonalities. All right. So you go back into that client that I mentioned to you,
[00:46:20] you know, with the buyer and being afraid when you go to bed at night. That's a common language.
[00:46:26] I don't care where you're born. You're going to be afraid. The day that you write that off
[00:46:30] for the its accepted, you go home that night. I don't care who you are. There's going to be a question.
[00:46:36] Did I screw this up? Yep. 100%. All right. Now it may sound different than did I screw this up,
[00:46:42] right? But it's going to be the same damn thing. So no matter what that is, the first step to being
[00:46:48] able to bridge the gap in between differences is to understand we're not that different. Yeah.
[00:46:56] And now that we can understand that we're not that different, then you find the commonalities
[00:47:01] and the connection is within the commonalities. So instead of, instead of letting the
[00:47:07] differences of culture, backgrounds, ethnicities, race, everyone's going to freak out the night
[00:47:12] before they they sign the check. That's it right there. That's it right there. Now you can now you can
[00:47:20] you can speak to those to those those desires, those fears, those goals. Yeah.
[00:47:28] Boy, Dan, you know, and what's so important about speaking to those desires fears and goals is
[00:47:35] because the emotion is what's striving the behavior, right? So if we can
[00:47:42] well these these these these fears, if we can help them when they're you you painted that example
[00:47:50] of, you know, the the night before or the day of and you know, all of these sort of accumulated
[00:47:58] a negative things happening at at on top of each other. Well, that is going to have a
[00:48:05] oh, sorry, it's going to have a cumulative effect. And that will in fact be much different
[00:48:12] than if the person was receiving that information on a massage table at the same time, right? So
[00:48:19] it's it's a lot about state management. And for you, I love the fact that understanding
[00:48:26] the commonality is so important. So you could say, okay, every buyer goes through this one particular
[00:48:31] experience or these five particular experiences. I am going to help guide them through these
[00:48:36] experiences because these are the five experiences they're going to remember most they're going to
[00:48:41] experience the most and they're going to need the most help. And when you do that, now you gain
[00:48:47] the trust. Yeah. I love it. Tell us about the book. So the book took me I think maybe 20 years or
[00:48:57] so to to put together. And I started writing it around five years ago. And it's a journey of
[00:49:06] of of understanding, you know, that the reader of the book is the hero of the book. And
[00:49:17] the book guides the reader from understanding that we are all worthy. We are all worth being
[00:49:28] loved. And we're all capable. And it walks the reader through the specific guide. There's four
[00:49:36] pillars throughout the book that if you could imagine if you could think of like a like a building.
[00:49:41] So if you think of your business as a building, a three-story building with a with a basement.
[00:49:46] And the basement of that building would be belief. And so when you're able to build the unstoppable
[00:49:52] business mindset and you're able to believe in yourself, now you're ready to be able to take
[00:49:59] action in sales. And so but without that belief, it's going to be really hard. So if you imagine
[00:50:06] that belief as the foundation, then on the first story of that building is going to be lead generation.
[00:50:13] And I walk the reader through here's exactly how to get leads. Here's how to use social media.
[00:50:19] Here's how to use YouTube. Step by step by step. Here's how to be able to do radio advertisement,
[00:50:25] networking, marketing. Here's how to be able to use Facebook, YouTube, whatever the case may be,
[00:50:32] I walk you through exactly how to be able to get business. And that would be the first level of
[00:50:39] business. And when you're able to believe in yourself, that's the foundation. And then the first
[00:50:45] story would be lead generation. And you're able to find business, then you're able to make some money.
[00:50:51] And you're able to make an impact. Now, if you want to make more money and more impact,
[00:50:56] then you build a second story. The second story of that house would be building an organization.
[00:51:02] Because when you look, if you take lead generation, you put it at in a three categories,
[00:51:09] prospecting, marketing, networking, prospecting, cost you time, marketing, cost you money,
[00:51:17] networking, cost you money, and time. Those are some assets that you have.
[00:51:21] So when you go to that first story of that lead generation, if you always want to sell and you
[00:51:27] always want it to rely on you and you never want to get any help, you're going to be limited
[00:51:31] off the asset of time 24 hours a day. All right. And you're either going to have a limitation on how
[00:51:38] effective that you could be in sales or you're never going to take a freaking day off.
[00:51:42] Right. So now the second story, if you want to actually start to scale, is about building
[00:51:49] your organization. So that's leverage and scale. And so the book walks you through believing
[00:51:54] yourself. Now, here's exactly how you find business. Now, here's exactly how you find the right
[00:52:00] support, the right systems, the right virtual assistants. Here's how you define who you are and who
[00:52:10] you want to attract to yourself to be able to help you and to do so in an affordable way.
[00:52:16] And then lastly, so the bottom floor, the basement would be belief, the build on several business
[00:52:24] mindset, the first floor would be lead generation. So we call that authority attraction.
[00:52:29] The second floor would be building organization. So we call that leverage and scale. The last
[00:52:35] story, the third story of the building would be leadership. My definition of leadership is to
[00:52:42] be able to teach somebody how to think so that they can get what they want. So I give you in the
[00:52:48] book specific examples, specific frameworks, specific step by step of here's how you can be a more
[00:52:56] effective leader exactly just like when I went through the self coaching model before with a step
[00:53:02] by step by step, the entire book is a series of steps like that that's delivered in a narrative
[00:53:09] that I go through my story. And I start with, you know, my, my childhood, I start with being on the
[00:53:17] floor, getting a shit knock that on myself when I was 10 years old trying to find my teeth.
[00:53:25] All right. So I start then and I go through the entire journey all the way up until my age today.
[00:53:34] Yeah, it's super powerful. Dan, Dan Roshan is our guest and the, the book is Teach to Sell,

[00:54:14] challenging home buying and selling decisions as well as, you know, helping guide your business
[00:54:21] itself. So, and also realizing, as Dan said at the very, very beginning, this, the clock cycle
[00:54:30] in his metaphor with respect to how we sort of experience the world is he's going to show you in this
[00:54:38] book how you can slow things down so that you can be more intentional about how you experience the

We read all of your comments and we are always looking to make improvements. So thanks for that. All right, guys, let's get to it. My conversation with Dan Rochon. What's the best piece of advice you've ever received real estate? Wow, wow. So when I got my license in 2007, an agent who I was working with who was mentoring me, she shared this piece of advice. It was not only, I think the first piece of advice, but it also turned out to be the best piece of advice. And her name is Garnett. And remember, I'll never forget this Garnett told me she says, Dan, never, ever, ever, ever, ever, leave an appointment without the next appointment set. You take out a buyer, you show them homes, and then you say, OK, what's next? And they say, I'll call you next week. Oh, great. You'll call me next week. What day? Maybe Tuesday. OK, great. If I don't hear from you on Tuesday, I'll give you a call at Wednesday. Is that sound good? Yeah. Should I call you on Wednesday in the afternoon or morning? Call me in the afternoon. OK, three o'clock. That sound good. Boom, done. So I know I went through that fast, right? But that would be the best piece of advice is to you never, ever, ever. Do you leave an appointment, a conversation, without a specific time schedule for you to follow up with that person? I could not be more of a fan of that particular piece of advice. I deploy that in my own life in all sorts of different ways, including because of my horrible memory, the doctor's appointments I go to with the annual doctor's appointments. So I have a very specialist or whatever. I do not leave that room before the office, before scheduling the next year's thing, because I will not remember one year from today. I won't remember a week from today for my work appointments. I certainly won't remember a year from today. That is a great piece of advice. Do not leave the scene of an appointment before scheduling the next appointment. Worst piece of advice you've ever received from real estate. I'm going to say it pretty general. So I know it was specific where maybe it was like a series of advice or I was following more than one direction. There's been times throughout my career where I would follow multiple paths simultaneously. I don't know if that was something necessarily that one person said to me, Dan, you should do 18 different things. It was probably more like 18 different people said to me one thing and I followed all their advice. It left me in a place of overwhelmed distraction, inefficiency and tiredness. Following more than one strategy at a time would be I think bad advice. Jack of all trades master of none kind of thing. That's right. Yeah, much to my chagrin, I can only handle about one thing at a time. I always say do one thing until it's 80% done and then hand it off to somebody else or a system. And then once you're able to do that, then you're able to take on the next task. But it's got to be at least 80% done before you move on. This is why we have Dan on the show. Dan Rochon is our guest today. He is the creator of the Teach to Sell system and founder of the CPI community after going from broke and stuck to building a consistently profitable real estate business, Dan has helped hundreds of agents and entrepreneurs achieve no broke months by mastering influence, neural linguistic programming, and story driven sales. First of all, I want everybody to visit Dan's website which is nobrokemonths.com. You can learn about all things Dan. He's a coach, he's an author, he's got a book coming out. I just call Teach to Sell, published by Simon and Schuster. That is a huge feather in Dan's cap. Simon and Schuster is at the very, very top of the literary publishing field. So this is a big deal. Dan is a big deal. We're happy to have him on the show, Dan. Welcome. Thank you. I appreciate to welcome. Appreciate you being here. Let's start at the beginning. Before you became the Dan that we that were about to learn, want to learn how about how you came to get into real estate. So tell us that story. Sure. So 2005, I was waiting tables at one of the one of the top real estate, real estate, where am I going with this. And one of the top stake houses in the entire planet. And I was waiting tables there. And I was making a ton of money. It was really, you know, well-known establishment one that all the celebrities would come to is in Washington DC. And I'm talking senators and lobbies and presidents and movie stars and athletes. You know, it was great, you know, but I freaking hated my job. Like I didn't like doing it. And, you know, I was at the time around 30 years older. So I was also simultaneously struggling with with my alcoholic addiction. And, you know, I'll call it have been come an escape for me around the age of 13 until it became a cage around, you know, the age of 32. And that's when, you know, my friend Dave and Dave, you know, he didn't, he didn't, you know, tried to talk me into something. He didn't make me wrong. He listened. He connected with me. He asked me questions. And, you know, and he helped me to be able to, you know, choose a better life. And, you know, as a result of that, I became sober. And I'm really grateful for Dave for that. And the unfortunate piece of that story was a couple of years later, Dave, he died as a result of his addiction. And, you know, he was able to, you know, he was able to help me and unfortunately, he wasn't able to help himself. And, you know, I'm forever grateful for that relationship. And, you know, regretful I was unable to, you know, help him in return. But nonetheless, I, you know, I was at that place in my life where I was sort of out of crossroads of, you know, what do I do? And I knew I wanted to be an entrepreneur. I knew I wanted to help people solve their problems, achieve their goals. But I just, I was waiting tables. I didn't know how. And one day, you know, when my buddy said to me, hey, Rochanne, I'd be able to consider, you know, real estate sales. And I had it at the time. I had done some investing, some fixed flips, some wholesale, all kinds of different, you know, crazy stuff. And I said, yeah, you know, let me check this out. And I found out that it was a 60-hour course work. It was a few thousand dollars to get started. And, you know, and there was no upper limits of it. You know, it was just, you know, based off of, you know, whatever you're going to put into this, what you're going to get out of it. So it seemed to me like a pathway to, it seemed to me like a pathway to be able to become an entrepreneur, to become a salesperson. And to really create a design-mounted life. And that's how I got started. Wow, what a story. What a story. So, yeah, Dan, appreciate you sharing being vulnerable and talking about some of the missteps along the way or the challenges. We all have them. And I have always been so impressed throughout my life when I see people go from addiction to sobriety. It is, it is a marvelous transformation. Almost everybody, if they follow the path as it is laid out before them, turns into just a wonderful human being. It is just incredible. And they become more productive. And you obviously are a shining example of that work. So congratulations to you and all of the success you've had since. So let's talk a little bit about got into real estate. So you were already working at the sort of highest part of the highest peak of the mountain as a server in Washington. You know, this is a high-end stake house. This is not an easy gig to get. So you knew how to be around people. You knew customer service. You certainly were affable enough. So how did you make that transition into sales? Well, you're right. And I would say I was definitely a salesperson as a waiter. And I look at that as my training. I looked at it as my training in regards to how to be able to manage multiple things simultaneously. You know, and to be able to sort of process, you know, in real estate sales, there's, you know, if you do a high, if you do enough volume, there's always pieces that are moving around. There's always challenges. There's, you know, different timelines. There's, you got prospects. In one hand, you got clients. In the other hand, you got, you know, aftercare. And there's so many different moving parts. But I would say that it was really, for me, it was understanding that what I learned as a waiter, you know, working with, you know, there was one day I was waiting out four tables. And in one of the tables, I had a, I had Eli Manning, Arch Manning, I washington Redskins at the time, a trainer and I think it was, it was like Arch Manning's wife. So Arch would be, you may have heard of like Archie Manning, who's like the guy, this would be his grandfather. And so, all right, so that's in one table. Another table I had John Kerry, who was a secretary of state and also as a United States Senator. And in the other table I had, I forget his name, but he was a Supreme Court justice. At the same time, I have a fourth table. And these tables are in bankets. So they're back to back to back. And so I'm in the fourth table, these two, there was these three guys and two of them were giving me a hard time. And they, I will never remember this, I'll never forget this rather. These guys are giving me a hard time and they're saying nobody famous ever comes in here. Exactly. I'm like, okay. No sweat, no sweat. And if you don't know, the Manning's are there. They are football players, just, who your listeners in on that. And so anyways, the point being is, I learned, you know, by working with these celebrities on a regular basis that human beings are spiritual beings manifested in this human condition. And it doesn't matter if you're at that level of celebrity or if you're at the place of, you know, I'd be walking to my car at the end of the night. And I'm, you know, given, you know, some homeless people, the bread from the bread warmer, you know, because it would go stale. And I would take a bag of it and give it to them on my way home or my way to the car. What I realize is that as spiritual beings, no matter where we are in life, we all want the same things. And we want to be loved, we want to be cared for, we want to feel that we're worthy. And we want to be able to, we want to be able to have relationship and happiness. And so as I recognize that in that realm, and then I became a real estate sales person to go back to your questions like, how'd you make the transition? Well, it wasn't really such a transition. It was, you know, there's a new tactics that I had to learn. There's new techniques. There's new things I had to learn. I had to learn the technical things of real estate sales. But ultimately, understanding who we are and understanding what's important to us and what's vital to us. Again, whether if you're a United States senator or Supreme Court justice or a football star, whoever, we all want the same thing. And if you go back to sales, it's, you know, it's not sales isn't about pushing. Sales is about leading. And if you're struggling in sales, you're probably doing it wrong. Right? So when I took on the, the knowledge is say, my job as a sales professional isn't to push things on to people. It is to be in rapport with them, connect with them energetically. It's to ask them a debt questions to deeply understand what their desires are and not just the technical stuff but also the emotional stuff. And then it's to actively listen to them at a deep, deep level, not in a place where I'm listening to the words, but in a place where I'm listening to the energy. And so I would say that it was less of a transition from one field to the other and more of a progression of just learning how to be able to navigate through human beings and spiritual beings in one realm, into another. And, you know, and that was my experience through it. Yeah, I love that. I'm hearing a lot of talk about connection. So we're talking about communication, connection, and that we want to be around people that we feel connected to and people want, feel connected to us are more likely to want to utilize our services, buy our products, and just spend time with us in relationship, as you said. So what we're really talking about today is not so much specifically about real estate although that is what we do here is really talking about what underlies the the sort of the deal itself, which is a relationship, which is connection. So I am super interested, Dan, in talking about that with you because I believe that if you can increase those skills and obviously you believe this is well because you teach it, if you can increase your abilities to connect with others, you will improve your business. You will get those ancillary rewards. But there are some skills to learn. There are some things that we weren't taught from our parents or from our schools. So I want to get into that. But yeah, let's talk about it. Talk about communication. Communication is the response that you get. And you know what I'm going to, I'm going to pause to as Dan just said something, utterly profound. He didn't say communication is one person trying to give some sort of information to another person. Dan said something really, really smart. I'm sorry, Dan, I'm causing you because I know what you said and what you said I want all of our listeners to hear. He said communication is the response you get. So what Dan's really saying is communication is your skill level to achieve what you want from the other, it's the feedback loop that you're getting. Dan, thank you for that. You're welcome. And thank you, DJ, for interrupting me on that. I mean, because it was or interjecting around the night interrupting. But thank you for interjecting. I was an interruption. It's like interrupting Kyle. I was a bad bad bad joke, you know, knock knock. Come on. Who's there interrupting Kyle? An arctic guy. Yeah, right. It's a great one. You don't want to go that direction. All right, we'll go back to the communication. Communication is the response that you get. And so what that means is that when you take on the responsibility of the result of the communication, then that puts the that puts it on you. And so it takes away the ability to be able to say like a buyer or a seller, for example, like, you know, I remember, and I think they still say it, but you know, buyers are liars, you know, and all these cliches that are just horrible. And it's like, no, it's it's it's it's when you don't take on the responsibility of of the result of your communication, then it allows for you to get lazy and allows for you to have excuses to be ineffective. When you say to yourself, whatever result that I get, I'm responsible for that. Then what happens is that you elevate your results extraordinarily. Now it's easy to say, well, what about the other person? Okay, well, guess what? They're also responsible. But guess what? Between you and the other person, there's only one of them that you have any say in. And that's you. And so that's the that's my definition of communication. It is a perfect definition. And I love that you really, really walk through that because that is so important for us to realize that communication isn't our intent, right? So Dan didn't say it's our intention, because oftentimes we intend to communicate something to someone and it doesn't get the result we want. They don't understand. They didn't believe you or for whatever reason, it didn't get communicated correctly. And we blame them. And Dan would say, okay, well, yes, they have a responsibility to process the information. However, I'm the one that delivered the information. So how do I re-deliver that information? How do I deliver it more elegantly? How do I deliver it in a way that they want to, or a way that they process information that they want to hear it? So this is what we're talking about. And I know we're getting really granular with communication, but it's so important. Because if you can kind of grasp this concept, as Dan said, this exponential growth happens, because you will start talking to people in the way they want to be talked to, not the way you want to be talked to. I love that DJ. Let me give you, let me give the actual like the science behind it. And I go and teach in the book, teach yourself why top performers never saw what they do instead. I go through this and it's called the self-coaching model. And what the self-coaching model is, is if you're not driving right now and you're at home, get out a piece of paper and a pen. And if you could, just we're going to draw a clock. And at that new and a clock, the 12 o'clock position, we're going to write down the word circumstance. All right, so we'll talk about that here for a second. So there's circumstance, something happens. And you observe that circumstance through your five senses. And then based off if your education, your background, your experience and life, you assign meaning to whatever it is that is happening. And then if you're drawing, if you're along with me around the two o'clock position, write down the word thought. Okay, so the circumstance that you observe through your senses, you then have a thought about them. And then if you go, if you're if you write down around the five o'clock position, the word feeling, now you're going to have a feeling about it. All right, so now what I just described so far, that's your life. That is your life right there. Now we're going to go a little bit further from this. We're now going to go over to the seven o'clock position. We're going to write down the word action. And then around the 10 o'clock position, that you do the word result. And so I'll go through all this again for you. So you have the circumstance at the new position, at the two o'clock position, you have thought at the five o'clock position, you have feeling, at the seven o'clock position, you have action and at the 10 o'clock position, you have result. And then you draw an arrow that's going clockwise between each of those. And what you just did there was you see that you have a closed loop of that's your life. Now how's that relate to communication? Because if you look at that gap in between the circumstance and the thought that circumstance is is fed from your experiences, from your from your education, your culture, your background, your upbringing, etc. And then we're going to throw something else on here. You go through some filtering, generalizations, deletions and distortions. So generalizations, deletions and distortions are communication styles, which are get the book and I explain it to you in the book. It's a little bit more complicated than what I believe I can do it right here. But the for the for the lack of a better term, it's it's the way that we process. And sometimes we leave pieces out and sometimes we add pieces. Sometimes we generalize like there's a president that will say sometimes everybody agrees with me. Well, that's a that's a broad generalization. Who's everybody? Okay. And you know, and I'm not picking on, you know, I'm not going to get into the political stream, right? But any well-crafted politician is effective in that communication to let you believe that they're talking to you and your needs. And they're doing so in a way, they're communicating a way that they're generalizing so that you can put what you want in there. So anyway, so what I just described to you is the self-coaching model. And I go through that in more depth in the book. But this is how we communicate and how we get results. And since I'm here, and this isn't about communication, but if you want to hack what we what we just went through, you could do so through feeding your subconscious, through things like visualizations, affirmations, reading, relationships, prayer, exercise. And there's different ways that you can you can program yourself to get out of that closed loop because what we just did was we did a clock with a closed loop. And that's why we did it like that to demonstrate to you that the that our lives are are cyclical, which is why you so often get the same results over and over and over and over again throughout your life. Yeah, we're talking about breaking patterns. And Dan said it very, very effectively there was that we have this loop, this loop around the way we experience the world. And this loop in his analogy sort of goes via a clock. Hand and it goes around, but it goes around without much intention without much conscious realization. And what Dan teaches you how to do is how to slow down those the the clock hand so that you can intentionally make decisions around what you feel, what you think, what you how you react. Because if you are in the driver's seat, you get to decide about how you show up. And that's really important for REALTORS, right? We as you said, Dan, you know, REALTORS are constantly under just a constant stream of emails, texts, phone calls, things go wrong. There's a constant barrage of information that's coming to them. Some that will throw them off their game. And a REALTOR really needs to be able to be mindful and able to to regulate in this way so that when these situations happen, the client, they might be very reactive. But the REALTOR now understands, okay, I am going to choose how I respond to this versus this is how I am responding to this. In other words, my default is this, but I may choose a different path. This is the essence of what Dan teaches. It's intention. How do I create intention around my action, my communication, and my skill? That's right, DJ. And right now, I believe it's more important than ever before, because that influence gap, it's everywhere. It's between leaders and teams. It's between family members, it's in politics. And with artificial intelligence, shape in the way that we see the world, what we read, there's so many things that, you know, with artificial intelligence, big data, technology, but AI, it can produce perfect information, but what it can't do is it can't see you. It can't look you in the eyes and know who you are. Technology can produce, you know, incredible information, but it can't cross that human threshold of connectivity. And as the world has changed, and it's changing out of velocity that I can not even describe, because not too long ago, when I first started being, yeah, I've been coaching agents for, I owned a real estate broker for 10 years, and I had 150 agents who worked for me, so I coach agents then, but I started coaching real estate agents around maybe seven years ago. And when I started coaching agents, I would talk about technology, big data and AI. And when I got to AI, people were like, oh, yeah, that's the future. Okay, this hasn't been that long. And when you look at the speed of how this stuff's being developed, why your ability to communicate matters today more than ever before is because it's hard today to even distinguish between real and fake. So you've got to be able to master these skills to be able to thrive if you want to survive. And when you do, then you're going to be able to really, you know, to be able to serve at a high level. Tell us how do we start that process? It's about understanding to be able to start the process is about being unwind, understand the basic, you know, let me walk you through an exercise. So think back, think about your favorite teacher, your favorite coach, your favorite guide. And if you're listening to this right now, and if you can, close your eyes for a moment, think back, see their face, hear their voice, feel the way that you felt when they believed in you. Now, open your eyes and imagine that that person walked into your life today and they gave you advice. You probably follow it, right? 100% I feel great right now. Thinking about that teacher who believed in me. Yeah, because they earned your trust. Yep. So DJ to answer your question, where do you start? Well, the starting point is just understanding how it feels like if you just did a DJ and if you're, you know, listening to this on, you know, on YouTube or wherever you're listening to this right now on your podcast. And if you did that as well, then you just had the experience of, yeah, I remember Mr. Smith or Miss Bobbitt or whoever the case may be. And I remember how she made me feel. And yeah, if she came in the room right now, and gave me some advice, I would follow that. Well, that's a demonstration of they didn't teach you algebra or history. They believed in you, right? They were probably there when you were struggling with a challenging relationship or, you know, you'd be in May fun of at school or maybe you're in a new school and you had no friends or whatever the case may be. And they earned your trust. So if we can understand that this is the way that we communicate at levels, that's the starting point. Just just having awareness of it. And now that you have an awareness of it, you can now choose moving forward to say, well, will I be that guy? Will I be that mentor, that coach, that teacher? And however many years ago it was that, you know, from that person that you were, you know, remembering, it was probably a really long time ago. And they made an impact that you remember them today. So now that you understand the power of being able to be, you know, to teach the cell, now that's the starting point. And now you can be able to, to be able to connect with people with other people at a, you know, at a full level, right? Because the connection starts when, when the other person knows that you care and when you listen. Yeah, let's, let's talk about, thank you, Dan. That's welcome. Really great. Let's talk about what do you do? So let's start with what are some of the practices, the exercises, the behaviors that agents can start doing to really understand by teaching that is really the pathway to sales. Yeah. It's not just, so there's a couple different ways here, DJ. So first of all, we, we, we use it in our marketing. Secondly, we use it in our client care. Okay. So it's not just to be able to get clients, but it's also to be able to serve clients so that they, that you build a bigger trust with them. Let me give you a specific example for real estate agent specifically. You're working with a buyer. Have you ever had this, Mr. Mrs. Real Estate agent, a buyer that went to the home inspection. And they came up with 172 things for you to negotiate. Probably happen to you if you listen to this. If that happened to you, then what do you do? You try to tell them, hey, you know, this is unreasonable. You try to convince them into understanding, you know, that that it's going to make things go really, really bad. You may lose a deal and it's just going to be, you know, not ideal. Of course, you want to, you want to protect their interests and you want to, you know, be a fiduciary and protect them, of course, right? But there's sometimes where things go like maybe a little bit further than what would be in their best interests. Yes. So the way that most agents do is they go through that and then they go and have a conversation with their broker and say, Mr. Mrs. Broker, what should I do here? And you're reactive. Why don't we do this differently? Instead, when you're consulting the buyer upfront, when you are consulting the buyer, have a conversation that looks up to like this. Mr. buyer, the day that we write it off for the gets accepted, you're going to go home, you're going to toss and turn. You may even have an argument with your spouse. You may be at odds with each other. You're going to, you're going to have a sleepless night. You're going to be second gassing. You're going to wake up in the morning. Your sister's going to send you a text. He's going to say, you're a freaking idiot for buying with the interest rate to where they are right now. Okay. And then three days later, you're going to do a home inspection. The home inspector's going to come in. He's going to give you 100 things that are wrong with that home. Now remember, Mr. buyer, you're at the place right now where you are emotionally charged. You have some buyers or more. You're uncertain about your decisions. You're making a half a million dollar purchase. And now somebody's telling you that all this stuff wrong with this with this home. Well, remember, Mr. buyer, if we get that situation in the in the process, it's perfectly normal. What I recommend is if that happens is that we protect you, the big ticket items, the things that are going to take cost you money, the HVAC, the plumbing, the electrical, etc. that we make sure that those are fixed and that those are in good repair and the things that may cost you $25 to fix. Maybe we don't even pay attention to that. And that window that's frosted, it's frosted today. The day that we're writing the offer, they're going to get accepted. It's still going to be frosted on Thursday when we do the home inspection. So if that's something that's of a concern to you, then maybe we should go find a different home because it is what it is. And so when you consult them up front of the predictable problems, that's one example of how you can do so. Now if that client goes through that experience, how are they looking at you when they go and they have that sleep with night? Yeah, they go, well, Dan told me this is what was going to happen. Dan really knows his stuff. I am having some quandary. Dan told me it's not worry about it because the next day we're going to go through this, we're going to figure it out, we're going to determine what's important. Dan, I will tell you, we're using this example. If anyone's thinking, I don't know how useful this would be, it would have been incredibly useful for me when I bought my last condo because I'm in the business. I'm a, you know, I'm technically a real estate agent. I don't practice, but I have a license and I was making the largest financial decision of my life, purchasing and I the night before, I wish somebody had said, by the way, the night before you're going to think I'm making the worst decision I've ever made in my life. By the way, I've bought before, by the way, it's not like this was my first purchase. So I'm really telling on myself, but the truth is the night before you, I almost fell over. I was so, I was so scared and I was so upset with myself and I was just a miserable person to be around and I wish, I just wish somebody would have been able to guide me through that in advance. Say, hey, DJ, here's what's going to happen the night before. You're going to probably freak out. Dan said it was exactly what I experienced. So I love the fact, Dan, that you're teaching people how to cope ahead and how to just predict the future, how to know that this experience is coming so that it doesn't have the same power that it might, that it did for me that night. Yeah, the difference, the difference being is the same thing happens. I can't change what's going to happen. Right. What I can change is when it does happen, the difference between my clients perception of me being a true professional versus an idiot. Same thing happens. Nothing different happens. The homeless factory either way comes and says there's a hundred things wrong with this property, but the difference is is when you, when you, you, you set them up front to, to, to, to expect that this is what's going to happen. Now that, that trust is gained and it still doesn't alleviate some of the fear or whatever the case may be, but it makes it feel more natural. And now just imagine how many more transactions you can do so that instead of being reactive and going to your broker, saying, Mr. Broker, what do I do here? And by the way, I learned all these systems when I was the broker. Right. I was the broker and, you know, by Tuesday, I've had, you know, 20 agents come up to me with the same problem. Like, you know, maybe there's a better way we can do this. Maybe instead of being reactive, it's fixing all the problems. Maybe we've got to identify what are all the problems and whatever the problems are. Now let's, let's say, let's consult them upfront before we get there. And that's, that's where teachers that was born. You know, I love that because buying a home or selling a home is such an emotionally charged decision. It runs the gamut. It prays upon fear and anger and sadness and all of our deepest emotions and, and also pricing, right. We have to figure out pricing. And all of it is just, it's heavy stuff. This is heavy, heavy stuff. And we oftentimes forget his real estate professionals, just what that emotional load is on the client. And if they don't know it's coming, if they don't know what's ahead of them, they're going to get hit by it. And it's going to be even more powerful. But as Dan said, you can teach, coach them through it. You can actually help them before, before it happens and give them guidance about, and also, you know, what it does really is, establishes you as the expert. Yeah, because you're like, oh, I know this thing. I've done this a million times. Here's what's going to happen. And you know, it's funny. I love every so often, I'll go to a restaurant and a waitress will come over and she'll say, it's very rare. But when it happens, I love it, they'll say, now look, when you start looking at the menu, we have a lot of stuff on here. Don't get overwhelmed. If you get overwhelmed, I'm going to guide you through it. Don't worry. And it's very rare when this happens, but I love what it happens. And then I just go, okay, what should I be looking at? Right? So we're talking about a version of that here. So again, all the way back to communication, how do you help people through? Because people can buy a home on their own, really, they don't really need you to purchase a property. What they need you to do is to help them through all of the ups and downs of the transaction. And so Dan's process with Teach to Sell is about how to effectively communicate in a way that meets their emotional needs, how to more effectively connect with them intimately so that you have the ability to even understand their thought patterns the way they interpret the world. And then you can then present solutions specific to the way that they are experiencing reality. That's right, DJ. And it's about understanding how other people have perceived the world. That goes back to some of the things that I shared with you before. I've got an opportunity, advantage in my marketplace that, you know, I'm in the Washington DC, I'm in North of Virginia. And so it is a very diverse marketplace, which means that any given transaction that whoever I'm communicating with probably has different upbringing than me probably looks different than I do, probably has a different education, different culture, different background, different ethnicity, because I'm literally in a melting pot. Now I love that. And at the same time, it also presents, I mean, you've got to stay sharp. You've got to be aware, right? You've got to be ready to be able to understand that the person who you're communicating with has a very different worldview, or likely has a very different worldview than I do, because they do. They grew up in a different country or a different culture, whatever the case may be. So what do you do when you, because you're absolutely right, a lot of us find that we work well with a certain type of client who's most similar to us, and we want to expand that reach to be able to connect with others that are more dissimilar. So what should they do to start considering bridging that gap? Bridging the gap of how to communicate or how to tell me more about the question. Yeah, so we were talking about having clients that are very different from us, right? So, and learning about their specific needs and what their values are. So you're in a situation where you have your in Virginia, you have a very diverse population, you have people coming to you that are very different from one another. These are not homogenous, it's not a homogenous culture. So you have all these different experiences, beliefs, behaviors, perceptions, and expectations. So how do you navigate through that? Yeah, so one of the things when I went through the CPI communication model earlier, the last part that reminds you is number one is connect energetically, number two, is to ask a depth questions, and number three is to actively listen. So two actively listen means that you're paying attention to their energy, you're paying attention to their spiritual being. And so regardless of what their background or beliefs and their, you know, the way of their being is, we still have commonalities. No matter where you're born in the world, we have commonalities, right? So it's not that hard to sit there and say, hey, let me be grounded. Let me stop, and let me just pay attention. Let me listen. Let me, let me observe. Let me connect with who I'm talking with. Because now when I can do that, now I can observe. And now I can also not just observe, but I can find commonalities. All right. So you go back into that client that I mentioned to you, you know, with the buyer and being afraid when you go to bed at night. That's a common language. I don't care where you're born. You're going to be afraid. The day that you write that off for the its accepted, you go home that night. I don't care who you are. There's going to be a question. Did I screw this up? Yep. 100%. All right. Now it may sound different than did I screw this up, right? But it's going to be the same damn thing. So no matter what that is, the first step to being able to bridge the gap in between differences is to understand we're not that different. Yeah. And now that we can understand that we're not that different, then you find the commonalities and the connection is within the commonalities. So instead of, instead of letting the differences of culture, backgrounds, ethnicities, race, everyone's going to freak out the night before they they sign the check. That's it right there. That's it right there. Now you can now you can you can speak to those to those those desires, those fears, those goals. Yeah. Boy, Dan, you know, and what's so important about speaking to those desires fears and goals is because the emotion is what's striving the behavior, right? So if we can well these these these these fears, if we can help them when they're you you painted that example of, you know, the the night before or the day of and you know, all of these sort of accumulated a negative things happening at at on top of each other. Well, that is going to have a oh, sorry, it's going to have a cumulative effect. And that will in fact be much different than if the person was receiving that information on a massage table at the same time, right? So it's it's a lot about state management. And for you, I love the fact that understanding the commonality is so important. So you could say, okay, every buyer goes through this one particular experience or these five particular experiences. I am going to help guide them through these experiences because these are the five experiences they're going to remember most they're going to experience the most and they're going to need the most help. And when you do that, now you gain the trust. Yeah. I love it. Tell us about the book. So the book took me I think maybe 20 years or so to to put together. And I started writing it around five years ago. And it's a journey of of of understanding, you know, that the reader of the book is the hero of the book. And the book guides the reader from understanding that we are all worthy. We are all worth being loved. And we're all capable. And it walks the reader through the specific guide. There's four pillars throughout the book that if you could imagine if you could think of like a like a building. So if you think of your business as a building, a three-story building with a with a basement. And the basement of that building would be belief. And so when you're able to build the unstoppable business mindset and you're able to believe in yourself, now you're ready to be able to take action in sales. And so but without that belief, it's going to be really hard. So if you imagine that belief as the foundation, then on the first story of that building is going to be lead generation. And I walk the reader through here's exactly how to get leads. Here's how to use social media. Here's how to use YouTube. Step by step by step. Here's how to be able to do radio advertisement, networking, marketing. Here's how to be able to use Facebook, YouTube, whatever the case may be, I walk you through exactly how to be able to get business. And that would be the first level of business. And when you're able to believe in yourself, that's the foundation. And then the first story would be lead generation. And you're able to find business, then you're able to make some money. And you're able to make an impact. Now, if you want to make more money and more impact, then you build a second story. The second story of that house would be building an organization. Because when you look, if you take lead generation, you put it at in a three categories, prospecting, marketing, networking, prospecting, cost you time, marketing, cost you money, networking, cost you money, and time. Those are some assets that you have. So when you go to that first story of that lead generation, if you always want to sell and you always want it to rely on you and you never want to get any help, you're going to be limited off the asset of time 24 hours a day. All right. And you're either going to have a limitation on how effective that you could be in sales or you're never going to take a freaking day off. Right. So now the second story, if you want to actually start to scale, is about building your organization. So that's leverage and scale. And so the book walks you through believing yourself. Now, here's exactly how you find business. Now, here's exactly how you find the right support, the right systems, the right virtual assistants. Here's how you define who you are and who you want to attract to yourself to be able to help you and to do so in an affordable way. And then lastly, so the bottom floor, the basement would be belief, the build on several business mindset, the first floor would be lead generation. So we call that authority attraction. The second floor would be building organization. So we call that leverage and scale. The last story, the third story of the building would be leadership. My definition of leadership is to be able to teach somebody how to think so that they can get what they want. So I give you in the book specific examples, specific frameworks, specific step by step of here's how you can be a more effective leader exactly just like when I went through the self coaching model before with a step by step by step, the entire book is a series of steps like that that's delivered in a narrative that I go through my story. And I start with, you know, my, my childhood, I start with being on the floor, getting a shit knock that on myself when I was 10 years old trying to find my teeth. All right. So I start then and I go through the entire journey all the way up until my age today. Yeah, it's super powerful.
