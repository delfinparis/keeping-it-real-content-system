[00:01:19] Today's episode is brought to you by corded.io.
[00:01:22] Are you looking for agents to join your brokerage or team?
[00:01:26] Now as a real estate recruiter, I can tell you the answer is always yes.
[00:01:30] But most agents aren't looking to move right now.
[00:01:33] So how do you know who to contact?
[00:01:35] Well, what if I were to tell you there's a recruiting and retention tool powered by artificial intelligence
[00:01:40] that shows you exactly which agents in your local market are looking to leave their brokerage right now.
[00:01:46] And which agents at your own firm are also looking to leave you.
[00:01:51] Now I've been recruiting REALTORS for 15 years and I've hired over 2000 agents.
[00:01:56] I can tell you with no exaggeration.
[00:01:58] This is the tool I've been waiting for.
[00:02:00] Corded AI looks for trends across dozens of variables for each agent in your market and shows you which agents they believe are likely to move.
[00:02:09] Not only does it do that, but corded AI went and visited my recruiting website and read everything I offer.
[00:02:15] So now when I'm recruiting, corded AI tells me exactly what to say based on that agents needs and what my brokerage can offer.
[00:02:23] It even writes emails for me.
[00:02:25] I've never seen anything like it and I use it every single day.

[00:02:39] And now onto the show.
[00:02:54] Hello and welcome once again to keeping it real.
[00:02:57] The largest podcast made by real estate agents and four real estate agents.
[00:03:01] My name is DJ Paris.
[00:03:03] I am your guide and host through the show.
[00:03:05] And just a moment we're going to be speaking with the top team.
[00:03:08] One of the top teams in all of New Jersey, the Bruin team.
[00:03:12] Ryan Bruin is our guest.
[00:03:14] He's going to talk about how he builds relationships with his sphere and he does an amazing job of this.
[00:03:21] You'll get a sense of that and you can take that right into your business.
[00:03:24] Before we do that, just a quick reminder, the best way that you can help us is by telling a friend about this show.
[00:03:31] Think of another agent that's struggling right now.
[00:03:33] And by the way, agents are struggling right now.
[00:03:35] It's a tough market.
[00:03:36] It most of the markets I for what fans tell me listeners tell me and even our own agents here in Chicago tell me that it is tough.
[00:03:45] We have low inventory.
[00:03:47] We have high interest rates.
[00:03:48] We have lots of people locked in at 3% mortgages who don't want to move.
[00:03:53] So there are challenges right now for agents and also, you know, the new compensation structures, you know, made things a little tougher.
[00:04:01] So let's help each other by sharing this podcast, letting other agents know there are solutions.
[00:04:08] And we talk to agents all the time every week on this podcast about how to overcome those challenges.
[00:04:13] Just send them a link to this episode or tell them to subscribe to the podcast or find us on YouTube or Spotify or wherever they find their podcasts.
[00:04:21] We would appreciate it.
[00:04:22] Also, if there's somebody in your market that you're like, I want to know what that person does.
[00:04:27] I don't know that person or I don't have access to that person, but they're crushing it.
[00:04:32] You tell us.
[00:04:33] You reach out to us and say, DJ, I want you to talk to someone.
[00:04:37] So we will find them.
[00:04:38] I will get to them.
[00:04:39] We will get them on our show because I want to help you learn what your, you know, your avatar, your person at the top of the mountain in your market is doing.
[00:04:49] I can get to them.
[00:04:50] I can get them on our show and I can do that for you.
[00:04:52] So just let me know who that is.
[00:04:54] And I'll reach out to them and we'll see if we can do an episode for those people or if you yourself are a top agent.
[00:05:02] You're like, I have a story to share.
[00:05:04] Hey, reach out to us.
[00:05:06] You know, we get pitched every single day by PR companies and, you know, publicists and just all sorts of different agents.
[00:05:17] You know, but we oftentimes REALTORS don't market themselves that much.
[00:05:21] So if you have a story to tell and you think it would be great on our podcast, let us know we'd always love to hear you.
[00:05:27] All right, let's get to it.
[00:05:28] My conversation with Ryan Brun.
[00:05:44] What's the best piece of real estate advice you ever received?
[00:05:48] So the best piece of real estate advice that I ever received I believe is I got it from my father and it wasn't exactly a quote so much as my father worked in real estate for his whole life.
[00:06:02] He worked in management at Coal Banker for ages started when he was young working for my grandfather's brokerage.
[00:06:08] And I remember when I, I think in my first year of real estate in Manhattan and I moved out here to New Jersey, teamed up with the family.
[00:06:15] And one of the things that I first noticed when I was setting up my marketing is we had these really nice custom bound books that we could put together a nice buying a machine in the office at my previous brokerage.
[00:06:29] And I came to a current brokerage at the time there were these outdated buying new machines that looked, you know, looked like they were about 20 years old.
[00:06:39] And I was complaining saying I can't believe that we don't have the nicer buying the machines. I felt it was really important.
[00:06:46] And, and you know, he said, listen, if it's that important, let's look into it and see what it costs. And if these buying the machines are going to be that value of your business, then you should go and buy one and figure out how to do it on your own.
[00:06:59] Don't wait for your brokerage to be able to provide it for you.
[00:07:03] And I did and at the time that was a really nice advantage that we had not a lot of people in our area were using that, but it also just really kickstarted the idea that hey, if you know, don't wait for somebody to do something for you or something to be provided for you, if it's important.
[00:07:19] If it's necessary, if it's going to boost your business, help your clients figure it out and find a way.
[00:07:25] Love it. Worst piece of advice you ever received in real estate.
[00:07:28] So I think the worst piece of my life I received was from him and some other agents that I knew in New Jersey back when I was starting in Manhattan real estate.
[00:07:38] I had a big network within the New Jersey real estate industry and a lot in him and a lot of the others at the time said, you know, good luck, but there's really not a lot of assistance and advice I can give you because we're in the suburbs, you're in the city and, you know, everything is different.
[00:07:57] And then after making the move here in New Jersey and working in the suburban market, I quickly learned that while there were many differences at the core of it, everything was kind of the same.
[00:08:12] So, you know, I kind of learned that however different markets might seem at the end of the day at the core of them, they really operate the same.
[00:08:22] And if you can get those core fundamentals down, you can operate in any different market environment.
[00:08:28] Perfectly said Ryan Bruin is our guest today. He is the team lead for the Bruin team servicing Morris and Somerset counties in New Jersey.
[00:08:39] He is the number one cold wall banker team in that area of New Jersey. Ryan takes the time to ensure that your property is marketed for greatest impact by specifically targeting this I love the right buyers.
[00:08:54] He possesses a balance of quantitative and qualitative skills, thanks to his numbers background as an account and his creativity honed via his marketing degree and entrepreneurial endeavors.
[00:09:05] Ryan has earned the designation of luxury home marketing specialist, which is amazing from at the Institute of Luxury Home Marketing.
[00:09:13] I want you to follow Ryan on Instagram. Two different channels. First is Bruin real estate. That's his team, Instagram account.
[00:09:21] And then Ryan J. Bruin is his personal follow them both. He has great content on there. And we will have links to that in the show notes.
[00:09:31] Ryan is also a smart home nerd who's obsessed with them with many technological technological advances that could make homes more efficient, convenient and comfortable.
[00:09:42] Ryan, welcome to the show.
[00:09:44] Thank you so much for having me DJ.
[00:09:46] I'm really excited to chat with you. I think.
[00:09:50] Well, I don't I'm sure I've had other New Jersey agents on I've done we've done over 600 maybe 700 episodes now I can't remember.
[00:09:59] And but I haven't talked to as many New Jersey people as I'd like and I always love talking to New Jersey agents because there's just in an authenticity to New Jersey that is very prevalent.
[00:10:13] But let's talk about it. So you come from a real estate family. What did you do beforehand?
[00:10:21] I've done a lot of things beforehand. Just before getting into real estate, I worked as an accountant, the license CPI. I still keep my CPA license active, even though I don't practice accounting anymore.
[00:10:34] But I did a wide variety of other things professionally and an amateur level from graphic design to film production worked up with this worked with a startup music business and not only helping to do some web design, but also business development and picture investors.
[00:10:52] So I really had a lot of, you know, varying experiences, you know, within the professional world before jumping into real estate.
[00:11:02] Yeah, you are clearly a creative guy as well. But also you you've really balanced both logic and creativity. So tell us about is that kind of your secret sauce is that you do both sort of the fun creative aesthetic stuff as well as the quantitative, you know, number crunching side.
[00:11:28] Yeah, and I wouldn't say it's just that I do the fun creative stuff and also the quantity of side. I really like to mix the two. I like to build. I like to create. I like to think outside of the box.
[00:11:41] So it's not just coming up with funny videos or creative marketing pieces. It's also using that creativity to, it's really take data, take analytics, take systems and processes and build and shape them in a way that helps myself my business and my team and my clients.
[00:12:04] Yeah, I love that. Tell us. So your father is in the business. He worked at Cole banker. He was in management.
[00:12:12] How did you always want to be a REALTOR or did it sort of know?
[00:12:17] Tell me the story.
[00:12:19] People always assume that because my family is in the business that's that I wanted to be in the business because of that.
[00:12:24] If anything, that probably kept me away from the business for a while, you know, growing up in it. I always just had this attitude of, all right, that's great. But like, you know, everybody wants better for themselves.
[00:12:38] They grew up with. So I thought, well, if they're doing that, then I think to find something bigger and better to be doing.
[00:12:43] But I really just have a great love for real estate. I, you know, I spent time in high school and college doing home renovations and construction.
[00:12:54] And then when I was living in Manhattan and New York City, working in the county, I found that, you know, I, I, well, my free time was spent walking around looking at the architecture, looking at the different types of homes.
[00:13:06] And even working on various clients, I had some clients that were law firms and, you know, in order to be in their financials and their escrow accounts.
[00:13:16] I just found myself quite up looking at, you know, building plans and, and floor plans and, and different purchase contracts rather than, you know, spending the bulk of my time where I was supposed to be in looking at the financial accounts.
[00:13:33] Yeah, it's, it's really interesting. You, you really seem to, to hover around a lot of different interests and those kind of nicely coalesced into a real estate agent position.
[00:13:46] And let's, let's talk a little bit about, you know, what's going on in your market right now. So I always like to talk about where the challenges are.
[00:13:58] Because every market has its challenges. I hear a lot of agents these days talking specifically about inventory. I don't know if inventory is an issue.
[00:14:07] So, yeah, so what I always think about is, you know, five years ago, we all refinanced into 3% mortgages or 4% or very low rate lending platforms.
[00:14:22] And, you know, we don't want to give that up. The homeowners or certainly we've been enjoying the benefits of not having to write those big checks every month.
[00:14:33] And it really creates a problem for homeowners who don't have to move, but could, could move because their homes appreciated, but maybe feel a little bit hamstrung because like, gosh, I don't, I don't know if I want a 7% mortgage.
[00:14:51] So I'm curious how you guys deal with it. I typically don't like to, so you, you know, you have to know me. You'll find that, you know, I don't look at problems at face value.
[00:15:01] So yes, most of the people you're talking to are saying that the problem is inventory, but the real problem lately is motivation, motivation to move.
[00:15:10] And one of the big factors behind that, yes, you're right, is the interest rates. A lot of people locked in at lower interest rates than this currently in the market.
[00:15:20] So it's really a motivation problem. It's not that people don't want to move. You know, the same old life events that motivated people to move in the past are still existing.
[00:15:32] However, a lot of the financial motivation behind that just isn't there anywhere from, you know, your upsellers who, while they would typically historically be more than willing to take on the additional financial burden, that additional financial burden has been increased to a point where that mostly emotional decision becomes much more financial decision.
[00:15:57] And then I think the biggest constraint on the market comes on the other end of the spectrum, which is the downsizers, the empty nesters who have homes that are too large for them, or, you know, not too large for them, but larger than they need.
[00:16:12] And, you know, not only is there no financial incentive to downsize, they might say, this is this homes much bigger than I need.
[00:16:19] Right.
[00:16:19] But why would I move to a, even though I don't need a house, this big one, I moved to a house half the size for the same amount of money.
[00:16:26] Yeah, that is a point, you know, you're the first agent to really bring that to my attention. I feel silly for not thinking about that before. That is the other side of that coin, which is absolutely the truth is, yeah, why am I going to downsize.
[00:16:41] I don't want to take care of this big giant house, but I got a pretty good deal on it.
[00:16:45] So yeah, and that's, I'm actually having that conversation with a lot of potential sellers right now that, you know, people who are at the age where they think they should be considering downsizing and they should be and you know, we sit down and they want to go over the finances and they assume that they're missing something because it looks like a pretty much a wash to go from a big house to a townhouse and, you know, I have to explain to them that at least around this area.
[00:17:11] It's less of a financial move and more of a lifestyle, you know, it is a lot of money, but you don't want to be, you have the money doesn't mean you want to be dealing with colon landscape or colon repair person, all that stuff. That's when it really comes into play.
[00:17:27] I agree. I also think that peace of mind, there's a cost associated with the feeling that you get when you walk into a home and rates go up and down and at the end of the day, it's just a number that comes out of your checkbook that, you know, if you budgeted correctly, you probably don't pay a ton of attention to other than you know it's there.
[00:17:51] And at the end of the day, if we're chasing numbers, like trying to say, it's almost like chasing the stock market, it's the best time to get into the stock market is when it crashes, right?
[00:18:03] And so, of course, that's the most time to buy a house is when you need a house.
[00:18:09] Exactly. And so, in waiting for the market to crash is interesting because when it does, you don't, it doesn't feel good to throw here.
[00:18:20] And then you can just throw your money into a stock after the companies misgirnings report.
[00:18:26] But like buying a house when it's increasing in value because I just spent a bunch of money, but it's going up in value.
[00:18:31] But no one feels if the market does go down, it doesn't feel good.
[00:18:37] But then also keeping in mind, if you look at the real estate market historically overall, you know, typically the up swings are bigger than the downs swings.
[00:18:47] You know, we've got years of the market going up and it's continuing to go up even on that appreciation has slowed down quite a bit.
[00:18:56] You know, but overall, if you look back, you had to be nice to hit that dip, but at the same time, historically we're probably going to look at this period and say, well, you know, yeah, we saw that small dip, but overall, if you go around now, you're probably going to be better for the market continues to behave as it has historically.
[00:19:14] Yeah, it is very interesting.
[00:19:16] While past performance does not guarantee future results, if we do look historically, the, you know, the home values have risen over the last 150 years in a way that's pretty much a straight line.
[00:19:30] It's not certainly not to the moon kind of levels, but you know, it is an investment that tends to gain equity over time.
[00:19:40] And as a result, and rates kind of do what they do and then they fluctuate and they change and you can have that conversation with the homeowner that says, you know, I don't, this isn't the perfect place for me, but I'm locked in at 3%.
[00:19:58] I don't want to get rid of it.
[00:19:59] And I think maybe the conversation is, well, I understand that who wants to get rid of that nobody, but if all the sudden rates came down to 5% today, here's what would happen.
[00:20:13] That right, right, you don't want to be jumping everybody who's waiting just like you is going to jump into the market and it's going to be a mess because prices will go out of control because everybody's waiting for that exact moment.
[00:20:26] So perhaps it perhaps it's even smarter, although maybe doesn't feel as comfortable to make that push now and sort of weather a little bit of that storm, knowing that rates, you know, kind of fluctuate from time to time.
[00:20:43] And if they dip at a point, maybe you can refinance, you know, do something responsible with your money, but you're buying maybe add a, I don't know if discounts are right word, but certainly not at a premium.
[00:20:57] Right, right. I think, I mean, I agree with you, you know, obviously add a bit of caution in there, you know, when the phrase rates first went up from their extremos, I think there were a lot of agents who were mistakenly running around saying, you know, marry the house, date the rate.
[00:21:12] Don't worry, it's just temporary.
[00:21:15] You know, I was, I was not a big fan of that whole, you know, campaign going on.
[00:21:21] Well, I did believe that at some point rates would stabilize or possibly come down.
[00:21:27] I thought that was a pretty ambitious gamble to be running around telling everybody to make.
[00:21:33] So you certainly do have to make sure that, you know, if you're going to buy the home and the rates are higher that you can afford it and you're not gambling on, you know,
[00:21:40] then coming down in a certain amount of time to be able to fit into your budget.
[00:21:43] 
[00:21:43] But, you know, I forget where I heard it, but I heard a quote that said, you know, there's no such thing as a bad real estate investment.
[00:21:51] And, you know, there's a good time to buy or a bad time to buy.
[00:21:54] It's just, you know, a varying amount of time that you have to hold on to that piece of real estate before it becomes a good investment.
[00:22:01] Yeah.
[00:22:01] So, you know, if you buy it super low, great, you know, maybe the market flips around and you make a ton of money quickly, but, you know, if you buy it, what would be.
[00:22:09] You probably considered in that point in time, a high point, you hold on to it long enough, you'll be looking back saying, wow, that was a great deal.
[00:22:17] I think people too often look at their primary residence as an asset.
[00:22:22] And I oftentimes, I think of it not as an asset until the day you sell it.
[00:22:30] Right.
[00:22:30] Because it costs money.
[00:22:31] And in the definition of the word, it appreciates.
[00:22:36] But overall, you're right.
[00:22:38] I don't think most people should, people should not be looking at their primary home as an asset.
[00:22:44] Right.
[00:22:44] They should be looking at as a lifestyle choice.
[00:22:47] I think home ownership is great.
[00:22:50] I think the best reasons for owning a home are not an investment standpoint.
[00:22:56] Financial either are some benefits in the sense where you have some stability in terms of your payment.
[00:23:01] I think it is more financially sound than renting while you do have millions of causes that can fluctuate and you do have taxes that can go up.
[00:23:09] Overall, you know, it's a lot more stable in terms of locking in your month of payment for the long term than renting where you don't know what your landlord's going to do.
[00:23:16] But I think it's, I think, I think especially lately, so many people have focused on the financial.
[00:23:23] Everybody wants to be an investment guru.
[00:23:26] And I think that that's the wrong way to approach owning a primary home.
[00:23:30] There are so many reasons.
[00:23:32] While it is, you know, in many ways financially beneficial, there are so many reasons that owning a home is beneficial to you, your health, your family, the development of your family, the community.
[00:23:43] I think those are really the primary reasons for owning the home.
[00:23:46] And if you literally look granular at, you know, what your investment gurus would consider to be a good investment, it doesn't fall into that.
[00:23:54] I wouldn't say the bad investment, but it certainly doesn't fall into the category with a lot of the other things that we consider to be, you know, great places to park our money.
[00:24:03] Yeah, I 100% agree with you.
[00:24:06] And let's talk about the Bruin team.
[00:24:08] So you come from this real estate team, you were one of the top teams really in all of New Jersey.
[00:24:14] And I would love to hear what makes your team special.
[00:24:19] Like what do you think you're doing that gives you more, more leverage maybe than other firms?
[00:24:28] Yeah, I think to really best summarize what I think we're doing that sets us apart is we're proactive.
[00:24:37] We're not waiting around for, you know, to be told what to do and what to think.
[00:24:42] I think that's always been a nice value value proposition of ours.
[00:24:48] But especially in the last five years when the market's been unpredictable, interest rates have been unpredictable.
[00:24:55] Legislation has been unpredictable.
[00:24:58] Technology has been unpredictable, not only the unpredictable, but volatile, all these things.
[00:25:03] We really pride ourselves in, you know, as we mentioned before, figuring it out, figuring it out fast, not waiting for somebody else to come and, you know, and rescue us, so to speak.
[00:25:14] And, you know, every time the market shifts legislation changes, mortgage rates change.
[00:25:20] While it's challenging and stressful, I've looked at all of those changes as an opportunity to get ahead of the competition.
[00:25:27] If everything stays the same, well, then it's hard to set yourself apart because you might be quick to learn and really ambitious.
[00:25:34] But the same person and set around doing nothing, after a certain amount of time they're going to know the same amount of you.
[00:25:41] If the market keeps changing, the rules keep changing.
[00:25:44] The agents who are willing to work hard to adapt, to think for themselves and not follow the playbook.
[00:25:50] So to speak, I think we really have an opportunity to get ahead and provide that added value.
[00:25:55] Because at the end of the day, if the market's not changing, how much do our clients really need us to?
[00:25:59] Because eventually they'll figure it out.
[00:26:01] So the volatility of the market and the way that we communicate into business has really been a great opportunity for us as a team who's really into constantly change and learn and adapt.
[00:26:14] I like how you said you stay ahead of your clients.
[00:26:18] That is a really nice, simple mantra to think about what do I know today that my clients do not know?
[00:26:28] And then how do I share that information with them?
[00:26:31] How do I provide that to them?
[00:26:33] How do I proactively reach out so that they don't learn it via another method or something else?
[00:26:42] And go ahead.
[00:26:43] I also think you can take that down to the simplest level.
[00:26:46] I mean, overall, yes, we're talking about things like how to navigate the market, how to get an offer accepted in a 20 offer situation.
[00:26:56] How to figure out what the new legislation needs before anybody's had any formal classes or trainings.
[00:27:01] But I think you can really take a time to the simple stuff too.
[00:27:05] I look at my own consumer behavior and I've realized there's times where different pieces of the transaction, different times within just a simple transaction,
[00:27:16] or have my clients reach not to me the questions.
[00:27:19] And there have been plenty of times where I'd say, all right, you know, closing's coming up.
[00:27:23] I need to, you know, get the utility and photo of my clients so they know how to set up their utility accounts.
[00:27:28] Well, I realized if that client then calls me as I'm dialing their phone number.
[00:27:34] And I say, hey, so glad you just called.
[00:27:36] I was actually just dialing your phone number to tell you this exact piece of information.
[00:27:40] And there had one or two things that's happening.
[00:27:42] They're either thinking, yes, you're lying to me.
[00:27:44] If I didn't call you, then who know that I would have had to figure this out myself.
[00:27:51] Or even on top of that is what we'll call it.
[00:27:54] Sorry, I don't like it.
[00:27:56] So number one, I have, but on top of that, today's consumer, especially the younger clientele.
[00:28:01] I find they really don't want to be a bother as much as they're paying you to do this stuff.
[00:28:05] They they worry about being a bother.
[00:28:07] So especially with the younger clientele, if they called me to ask me that question, even if I was about to call them.
[00:28:12] Chances are they were thinking and worrying about that for at least a couple days before they gained the courage to say, you know what?
[00:28:19] I've given enough chances to get on top of this and now I'm going to ask them.
[00:28:23] So I tried to, you know, the past it was I tried to address things as they become relevant.
[00:28:31] And I've learned to adjust my systems and processes to address things before they come to mind in to the client's mind, not relevant.
[00:28:42] So something we're in a point in transaction where a piece of information is not relevant for me to burden my client with for until another month from now.
[00:28:50] And there's other things we should be focusing on, but I found that consumers typically at this point in time start thinking and wondering about it.
[00:28:58] That that's when it needs to be addressed because while I'm trying to get them on board with all these other things, they're sitting there worrying about something else that we're not at yet.
[00:29:06] That is incredibly important pieces that you understand the emotional and the logical process of a home buyer and home seller and where they are in that process.
[00:29:19] You are ahead of them in the sense of I know what's coming and I'm going to address that before you, Mr. Mrs. a consumer address it.
[00:29:30] Because like you said, when by the time they bring it to your attention, you're right, days have gone by, they've already thought about it, they may be they googled it, they've wanted to find the answer on their own.
[00:29:42] You're right, younger, younger people don't want to pick up the phone and call you first. They want to get an answer on their own first.
[00:29:49] They're going to look it up and then they might get confused and then they might need a real answer by calling you to get the final answer.
[00:29:55] So what you're doing is actually quite profound. It's thinking ahead of the game and really just being ahead of everyone and thinking, okay, what's coming up, what can I prepare for, what can I prepare my clients for so that they don't have to Google something, they don't have to call me that they are, oh yeah, that, you know, that makes perfect sense.
[00:30:19] Okay, that's what's coming cool. I think the being prepared is really part of your secret sauce.
[00:30:28] And also understanding that if it's important to them, it's important. I've had certain clients where the one spouse says, you know, excuse my husband or wife, they're going to have all these dumb questions about things that are not important and understand, you know, I've had to explain to them that if it's something they're worried about, then it's important.
[00:30:49] Yeah, I love that. Let's, I know you're also really into smart home and tech to make homes more, more efficient.
[00:30:59] Talk about where, where you see that headed heading and what, how do you utilize that in your practice?
[00:31:09] Yeah, so I think technology in general, I have a pretty interesting approach. I think a lot of people that may not be as, as eager to adopt technological advances, at least now a day might make the arguments of everybody's got their heads buried in the screen.
[00:31:25] And we need to be more present in the real world. In my opinion, technological advances, especially in a smart home realm, do just that. They don't, they take us out of a screen.
[00:31:38] They put us more in the real world. I think good smart home technology and technology that I used to support my business as well should get us all out from behind the computer.
[00:31:50] They should be more voice activated and then in terms of screens, they should be more intuitive than, you know, reactive.
[00:31:59] And so I think there's a lot of efficiencies and conveniences to be had with, with smart home technology, especially as, as much as we like to write at this point in time, complain about how homes are so expensive and getting a being able to afford a home that's a reasonable size for a family is difficult.
[00:32:18] So if we look historically, our homes currently are much larger than homes of past generations, you know, some of the houses that we might consider to be normal or slightly larger than normal.
[00:32:32] And you know, in the, you know, in centuries past would have had full staff. You know, now we have people buying these larger homes that might be more mainstream for today, but larger homes with the expectation and the budget to maintain them on their own.
[00:32:49] And so I think smart home technology is really important for making that possible. Otherwise, a lot of these homes will be overwhelming. And, you know, whether it would be a physical burden, financial burden, and falling to disappear.
[00:33:04] Yeah, I agree. I, I, but the idea of being more present is a really interesting concept because you know, I was thinking about it as you were saying voice activation commands in particular. So I have my home wired for why use Google Home Assistant.
[00:33:23] And while it's, it's certainly not as perfect as I would prefer it to be. It does respond most of the time fairly well. And I just have to talk to it to turn things on, off dim, etc. I can turn on an off and appliances.
[00:33:45] And it allows me to maintain a conversation with somebody and just pause for a second while I bark out the command into, to the air. And it seems sort of like novelty. Maybe like, oh, that's kind of a neat little trick.
[00:34:02] But it was fun to be able to show off to your friends.
[00:34:04] But it certainly is cool. Like I can tell my shades to go down and that is fun. But the reality of it is it does, it does change or it lengthens the amount of being able to be present the time I can be present.
[00:34:23] So it does actually help in a way to allow me to continue what I was doing beforehand with another human being.
[00:34:32] And the simple things in terms of enjoying our home, like think about it.
[00:34:36] You know, agents, we all know if you're showing a house, what do you do before a showing you, you'll close all the open all the shades and you turn the lights on.
[00:34:45] And you don't do it when the clients there, you want them to walk in and be able to see that sunlight coming in and really be able to see and enjoy the aesthetics of that home.
[00:34:55] And as homeowners, you want the same feeling, you come home from work, you want to walk in the door, you want to be able to walk into a well-lit comfortable home that's a comfortable temperature, enjoy your beautiful views.
[00:35:08] And smart home technology allows that to where before you either keeping your shades open and your lights on, which you're not going to do, you'll leave the house or you're walking in a dark, dreary, you know, home.
[00:35:19] You want to be greeted by your home, you don't want to have to walk in and decide.
[00:35:23] I mean, before smart home technology is like, I'm going to run upstairs and grab something and I'm going to do it in the dark because I don't want to run around and all the lights, which is I want to walk in a room and deal with.
[00:35:31] I want to see everything, see the light coming in or even waking up in the morning, you want to wake up and have that sunlight hit you before you get out of bed.
[00:35:38] You know, it's really being present in your home and in the world around you.
[00:35:44] Yeah, as you're talking about that, I realize I do a lot of those things where I do have my lights turn on before I walk into my house.
[00:35:53] Because I set it up that way, I have them also turn on in conjunction with the, with the sunset.
[00:36:03] So I know that they're they turn on a certain amount of time before the sun sets.
[00:36:08] And you know, it again, you're right, it does create an experience.
[00:36:13] And for for realters, this is something that if your clients have these sort of technologies, you can utilize these and showings.
[00:36:22] If you if you have the lens, if you are able to plug into that, you could actually deliver these experiences to people on a showing.
[00:36:33] But yeah, I actually when I when I sold my last my, when I moved last home, I was selling, I had it so that you know, it was activated by the smart locks when that person unlocked the door.
[00:36:47] It turned all the lights on, opened all the shades and actually greeted them said, welcome to your new home.
[00:36:53] Oh, it's great. And I really feel I mean, someone who for someone who loves homes, I feel that, you know, that that perfect environment should be greeting us when we walk in the door, because that's when it matters most.
[00:37:09] Oh, I love that. I love that. I'm getting ready to sell my condo. I'm going to think about how when somebody comes to the showing, I can, what I won't be there, but it would be great to have them go, welcome to your new home in a way that's.
[00:37:20] Yeah, it's funny. Go ahead. Having a smart home, it's fun. It's funny. How much stuff I have to do for my clients that I don't have to do my own home, the amount of times where it's, hey, we went away on vacation.
[00:37:33] We've got back to back showings and I've got to go drive over to their house to turn up all the lights for the night when I'm like, well, if they just had a little smart home tech like I did, they'd be able to just go on my phone and hit the button and be done with it.
[00:37:46] Yeah, it's it's remarkably inexpensive to it's amazing how how you can do this for for very little.
[00:37:53] Right. It's not key, but, but you know, if you look, I remember actually with this past holiday season, watching, I think it was home alone for and the whole premise of the whole thing was that his dad was dating this very wealthy woman where her home was automated and just laughing because my daughter's looking.
[00:38:12] It's supposed to be exciting for these kids to see like wow, this lady's so rich that like she can tell her shades open and they open and my daughter's looking at me like what's the big deal.
[00:38:25] Let's talk about the face to face interactions that you and your clients have.
[00:38:31] How do you maintain your relationships with clients so that in between their home sales, they don't forget about you.
[00:38:39] Yeah, so I think one of the cornerstones of my marketing is client, client relationships.
[00:38:53] I'd say a lot of agents seem to focus a lot on new lead generation.
[00:38:58] I focus a lot more of my energy on client relationship management.
[00:39:06] Every home that I sell, I want to be the beginning of a long term relationship with that client and not just a transaction.
[00:39:15] I want every client of mine to come back to me for every home seller purchase for themselves for the family and recommend or refer to me.
[00:39:22] I do a lot in the traditional sense in terms of birthday cards and home anniversary cards and holiday cards and things of that sort.
[00:39:34] I'm always trying to improve this piece.
[00:39:36] I try to make a big effort to bring them into my family so to speak.
[00:39:43] One of the benefits of working in this business is I get to work with so many great people.
[00:39:47] The process of purchasing or selling a home is such an intimate process that you really become very close with these individuals.
[00:39:56] I try to, not only for my business purposes, for me personally as well, to maintain those relationships.
[00:40:03] I think one of the toughest parts about my business is about this business is that you're working with a home buyer.
[00:40:10] You could be working with them for months. You're really having personal conversations.
[00:40:16] You're part of one of the biggest life events for them and then you close and it's like for both of us, it's like when am I going to see it?
[00:40:25] We've been hanging out every weekend and having some really great fun and conversations.
[00:40:30] I try to keep it less formal. I've done some of these client appreciation events.
[00:40:38] As my business grows, it's a little bit tougher, but I try to keep it more personal and make sure that I get together with my various clients no matter how long it's been since they've purchased or sold the home and make it a little bit more personal, one to one, getting dinner, going to the pool, playing some golf rather than some big generic event or
[00:41:00] communication campaign that's just, hey, I'm sending this to you and everybody else.
[00:41:03] I like it. So you're doing the more small get-togethers and personalized. I like that.
[00:41:10] 
[00:41:11] How does that translate for you? Again, you're not doing it to get more business, but it does result in more business.
[00:41:21] It's a factor and it's definitely valuable because I think some of the more generic types of communication that we use to keep in touch with clients and state, quote unquote, stay top of mind.
[00:41:34] We might continually be in their faces, but let's face it.
[00:41:38] Everybody we know knows five other REALTORS.
[00:41:41] So just being top of mind isn't always enough.
[00:41:47] You need to keep reminding them of it helps the constant reminder of the relationship that you have, the value that you've provided, the care that you take in them and their lives and their goals.
[00:41:59] I don't think that you can necessarily accomplish that with some of these more generic marketing campaigns we do.
[00:42:07] It's nice in between to keep your face in front of them, but if you're not tying that in with more personal touches, then I don't think it's going to be as effective.
[00:42:17] Not to mention people, like we said, people don't want to bother you. A lot of these, a lot of people are thinking of fine or selling a home long before they actually think of reaching out to an agent.
[00:42:30] So having those personal events, personal communications, personal get together, allows these people to pick your brain where they may not have picked up the phone and call it you otherwise.
[00:42:41] Yeah, it makes perfect sense. I love the idea of the proactive personal touch is, you know, every, like you said, every person knows five REALTORS.
[00:42:52] They're getting five REALTOR newsletter emails each month. They're also, you know, probably getting a few mailers here and there.
[00:43:01] And, you know, maybe even a few texts here and there, but how many of those other agents that you're technically still competing with are picking up the phone and calling the person say, hey, how are you doing or what's going on with, you know, your business or how are things at work or how are the kids or whatever it might be.
[00:43:21] That personal touch, that proactive reach out or just share some information. Hey, I was thinking about you. I'm going to send you an updated value of your home so that you can see what I think your home is worth right now.
[00:43:35] I know you look on Zillow, like everybody, but let me, let me take a crack at it.
[00:43:39] Yeah, and it's not just evaluations. It's in a more personal level, I think about like, you know, I get excited for these clients, you know, they all have their personal interests and these homes are all unique.
[00:43:50] And finding the right home for them is often extremely exciting for me.
[00:43:55] You know, so I want to know not just, I want to keep in touch, not just so I can, you know, keep them informed of their value of their home and what's going on with the market.
[00:44:02] But like, hey, like you were super excited to put a pool in that backyard. Did you put a pool in yet or like, you know, you were imagining having your daughter's birthday party with pony rides in that backyard.
[00:44:12] Like, is that happening? I better be getting an invite because I was super excited for, you know, I was just as excited with that idea as you were.
[00:44:20] So, you know, it's really, it's much more personal than just dollars and cents and transactions.
[00:44:27] It's these homes, like we said, it's not, it's not an investment in the true sense of the word.
[00:44:34] It's a lifestyle choice person in these homes. And I love to keep in touch with my clients and see how they're using their homes and how they're enjoying their homes that they, you know, put so much time and effort.
[00:44:46] We all put so much time and effort to be a little bit cheaper.
[00:44:50] How important is it for you to keep your CRM up to date with all of this information?
[00:44:55] Very important. At the end of the day, you know, every year that I'm in this business, I meet more people, I sell more houses.
[00:45:04] And, you know, I wouldn't call myself old yet, especially by industry standards, but, you know, more information going into this brain and I'm sure as yours continue to go by the output is not going to, is going to dimension at some point.
[00:45:20] So keeping all this information somewhere easily accessible that can assist me is super important.
[00:45:28] Yeah. And, you know, this, and it also gives you a reference point, it gives you data to, to, you know, talking points when you contact these people, you now have things to chat about.
[00:45:44] How often are you doing outreach to your existing clients?
[00:45:51] Not as often as I should be.
[00:45:55] You know, I use birthdays and home anniversaries and holidays as benchmarks.
[00:46:00] My goal is to have those not be the only or reach out.
[00:46:07] But I would like to do it more frequently. I think one of my biggest challenges is that intention and desire to make it personal and relevant and authentic sometimes keeps me from reaching out as often as I should.
[00:46:21] That's where my CRM and my systems really help come into play, not to replace or depersonalize the experience for them or for me, but to be able to keep me on top of it.
[00:46:30] I would say one of the benefits of working in this business, you know, some people like to say, oh, real estate agents, you know, every relationship is fake.
[00:46:39] And it's, it's so they can totally sell you home. I look at this the other way around.
[00:46:43] One of the benefits of this business is it forces me to maintain these relationships that I value, but maybe won't put as much instinctively put as much effort into maintaining.
[00:46:53] And, you know, I'm lucky enough as a part of our job to be forced to come up with better ways to keep these relationships going.
[00:47:04] So, you know, I try to keep, I try to implement more outreach to my clients that are more personalized to them and their needs, their life situations and steer away from the generic.
[00:47:19] I love it. Walk us through a, I know, no, no day is typical for an agent, but what of those fundamental activities that you do every day?
[00:47:30] So, when I first wake up, I kept my email, one of the systems and automations that I put into places, I, my transaction dashboard transaction management system that I built myself sends myself and everyone in my team a daily reminder of everything that you need to do that day.
[00:47:54] And in the next seven days, whether it be confirming a mortgage commitment, reaching out to someone for their birthday, things like that.
[00:48:02] So, that's the first thing I check to see that and my calendar to see what the day has ahead of me.
[00:48:08] And then I check my phone for birthdays. I want to see who's birthday is, who I can reach out to, wish them a happy birthday.
[00:48:16] And then from there, it's, you know, this is all before I breakfast. I have my set up on notifications, everybody that is in my contacts.
[00:48:28] I make sure that I'm, if there's any home sale activity within their neighborhood that I'm notifying of that first.
[00:48:36] The house came on the market, the house just sold in the neighborhood of somebody that's in my contacts. I'm letting them know.
[00:48:42] 
[00:48:42] Trying to be the first one that they hear from.
[00:48:45] I want somebody.
[00:48:46] That is a profound, that is a profound tip, everyone.
[00:48:51] If you didn't just hear that, what Ryan's doing, that's a great idea.
[00:48:56] So Ryan has his, he has, he has alert set up for his CRM for any home activity, new listings, maybe pendings, the closes, whatever, whatever is relevant to that person.
[00:49:11] He's got it set up so that he can say, hey, I just saw this thing happen in your area.
[00:49:17] Yeah, if, you know, if the house came on the market down the street from them, I want them to hear from me before they wake up, get dressed, fall their driveway and drive them to see that sign in front of it.
[00:49:28] I love that. Are you doing that via text via call, how do you do that?
[00:49:32] Email, I do that via email.
[00:49:34] And I think most of us have our clients or our active buyers set up on home alerts.
[00:49:40] It's simple. You set yourself up on home alerts, create an alert for every single one of your clients or for every neighborhood in the group those clients by neighborhood.
[00:49:49] You know, it's easy enough.
[00:49:52] It's helpful not only for sending them emails and texts, you know, keep them up on it.
[00:49:56] But even if you're not doing that, set yourself up on those alerts for every single client.
[00:50:00] So that way, I mean, what's worse than, you know, you go to a happy hour and you bump into someone you know.
[00:50:07] And they start asking you about the house that just came on the market on their street that day and you know nothing about it.
[00:50:13] Right.
[00:50:14] Anybody that you know, you should know what's going on in their neighborhood.
[00:50:17] And it's easy enough with automated alerts.
[00:50:20] Boy, that is a really, really smart idea. And I think, I think you're wrong that most agents don't do that.
[00:50:29] And I think that fact that you do it is incredible. And I encourage everyone in our audience to set yourself up for what with these alerts because again, someone isn't going to sell their home for the next seven to nine years possibly.
[00:50:44] But, but everyone's always curious what are the home down the street.
[00:50:49] They have friends.
[00:50:51] Yep.
[00:50:52] You know, if you bump into them at a cocktail party and you know, a bunch of information about the house down the street that just came on the market and their friend was thinking about moving to the area.
[00:51:03] Well, you know, if they showed up and you knew a bunch of information about it, they're much more likely to send them your right.
[00:51:10] I'll pull back the curtain a little bit on my I recruit REALTORS or a living, but REALTORS can take what I do and apply it to their own business.
[00:51:19] So I have a little trick. It's not a trick really. It's something anybody could do. I do a version of this. So when when I see an agent that I want to recruit over to our company, I see that they got a new listing.
[00:51:34] I so my version of what you're talking about is I send them a text. Hey, I just saw you got a new listing over on Polk Street. Congratulations.
[00:51:41] Yeah, I said I'm a text. I don't ask them for anything. I just give them a little like that a boy. You know, good job.
[00:51:48] And, you know, I do that for a couple of reasons. One, I'm genuinely proud or excited for them.
[00:51:56] Right.
[00:51:56] To, I also want to be the first person to tell them that I saw that they did something great.
[00:52:03] Right.
[00:52:03] And, you know, and three, it might start a conversation. It might start a conversation about, oh, tell me tell me what's going on.
[00:52:14] Are you happy at your brokerage or brokerage? I'm good care of you because they might think gosh, my own broker just in congratulating me.
[00:52:20] Right. So this is the same way that REALTORS can can really start to find new clients is, you know, when you just because you didn't sell somebody a home doesn't mean you can't provide value to them.
[00:52:32] Does it mean you can't notice? Hey, I just saw this thing happened in your neighborhood. I thought you might be interested in it or, you know, and now with AI, you could really set up a lot of these automations to run and have AI scour the internet and find information for you and say, oh, I just saw that, you know, in your neighborhood that this event just happened or this event's coming up.
[00:52:54] And I thought you might be interested in.
[00:52:57] Yeah, and the key is relevance, you know, we're all getting hit with a ton of information.
[00:53:02] No one is starving for information, what we're starving for is relevant information.
[00:53:06] Yeah.
[00:53:09] That's a really good point.
[00:53:10] Relevant information. I love that. And that's what why you should have a really detailed CRM so that you can know specifically what's of interest to each of the people in your database.
[00:53:23] And you know, what we're really talking about in Ryan, it seems like this entire conversation has been mostly about deepening connection.
[00:53:30] How do we deepen connection with people? And we're so lucky that we have these tech products that a lot of them largely are free that allow us to organize this information where our brains aren't going to remember everything's perfectly.
[00:53:49] So we can leverage technology to remind us, hey, it's someone's birthday at someone's home anniversary. Hey, this thing just happened in their neighborhood or, you know, I got to reach out to you.
[00:54:02] You go to a broker open house and you see something cool about the house. Oh, it's got a really cool wine cell.
[00:54:07] Well, people I know that are really into wine. Let me send them a quick photo and say check out this house. They may not be buying that house, but hey, look, I'm in this house a really cool wine cell. I know you love wine or your big band of basketball. Look at this person's house and they had a, you know, Jersey signed by Michael Jordan.
[00:54:25] Like isn't that cool, you know, super boring or something, you know, it's not just, hey, here's, here's a house in your neighborhood. That's valuable, but get as granular as you can. Hey, I know that you can afford to buy a house more than $800,000.
[00:54:39] And you're not even in the market right now, but I'm just in this $10 million house that had a full basketball court. And it would that be awesome. You love basketball.
[00:54:47] Yeah, it's this I'm thinking about you. And, and we all are desperately, you know, hungry for the I think about you.
[00:55:01] Yes, it is. And they don't the good news is the, here's the bad news. The bad news is they take a bit of work to do. The good news is that they're worth it because they're very infrequent.
[00:55:14] So, yeah, so if you can put a couple of minutes into a genuine reach out for and Ryan, we haven't mentioned anything about, hey, have you, you know, any sort of salesmanship.
[00:55:28] This is we're talking about, you know, building relationships, maintaining relationships, keeping relationships and doing things that are actually in the client's interest so that they want to respond to you.
[00:55:41] Yeah, that, that this is really I see this as the key to what the brewing group has, has done your team has been very, very successful. And I can see that that you're always looking for opportunities to connect.
[00:55:55] Yeah, absolutely, absolutely.
[00:56:00] Well, I have, it's a challenging market right now. We talked about inventories a little tighter than we would like. Of course, people are maybe sitting on the sidelines because of rates more often than they should.
[00:56:19] And, you know, but you're right, life happens. So tell me a little bit about what are the proactive things you're doing right now just to keep the business running.
[00:56:32] Well, two things. Number one, when things do get slower, I work on my business. Sometimes when it gets busy, you're I'm so busy working in the business.
[00:56:40] I don't have as much time to work on the business. Yeah. So, and when things get slow, the first opportunity I take is let's look at my systems, my processes, our day to day, our budgets.
[00:56:49] Where can we refine and improve that because the business is always going to turn around. It's always going to pick up a good be tomorrow, could be next month, be next year.
[00:56:57] And let's put ourselves in the best position to take advantage of that because I feel like if we, you know, when it gets slower, yeah, people would run around and make attempts to generate business that's not there.
[00:57:13] And there's only so much that you do, but I always look at the best thing you can do to make these slower times easier is make sure you don't let anything slip through the cracks when it's busy.
[00:57:22] When you're super busy and a deal falls through or you forget to call somebody or you miss an opportunity, you're too busy and joy in the, you know, the great year you're having to really feel that.
[00:57:34] And then the next year when you're sitting there saying, oh, business is down, you're looking and saying, well, you know, business is down now.
[00:57:40] It would have been nice if I had closed that one extra deal that I let's sit through the cracks last year. So there are things I do to drum up business within, you know, during the slow times.
[00:57:50] But I'd say my biggest focus during the slow times is put things into place to be able to make sure that things don't fall into the cracks when it's busy when it might be easier, you know, fix your, fix your net when the fish aren't fighting because, you know, when they're fighting, you want to be able to grab as many as you can.
[00:58:07] Yeah, that boy, that's a great analogy. It's such a such a smart thing. It's, it's don't, don't they, it's the expression the worst time to learn how to fight is when you're in the middle of the fight.
[00:58:18] Like don't learn to fight while you're in a fight, learn beforehand.
[00:58:22] Right. You know, so that you can prepare. So we're talking about preparation and what I love about your process and your team's process is that you know what you're doing every day.
[00:58:32] And in fact, you might not even know what you're doing every day, but there's a system that knows what you're going to do every day and it tells you, right, you're going to do this, right, you're going to do this, this, this, this, this. And then you can just execute the plan.
[00:58:43] And of course, life is going to get in the way anyway and screw up the day as it does. But at least you know where your true North is. Oh, I have to get back on this plan. I have to go back to X, Y and Z.
[00:58:56] I have to do some prospecting. I have to do some client maintenance. I have to evaluate my finances. I have to, you know, we have to do all run the business.
[00:59:06] Right. There's a lot of that stuff that can be done ahead of time. You know, we all think we're so busy and we are.
[00:59:12] But out of those things that you're doing that you're busy, how much of that stuff is repetitive, how much that stuff can be planned for.
[00:59:20] You know, if the majority of the questions you get from your clients are similar, all right. Well, you know, when you're slow and you have time sit and slowly and thoughtfully put together that response to that question.
[00:59:35] So when it comes up, you have the response ready to go. You know, with certain contracts, usually time sensitive, they need to be sent out. Well, can you put together a template where certain information is filled out already in short in that time.
[00:59:48] When you're busy and you need to be done urgently.
[00:59:52] Yeah, I really see your team as an educator. You guys are constantly thinking about what's, you know, what's in front of us. What's the next thing that's going to be here.
[01:00:04] It'll be here soon. So let's prepare for it. Let's get it ready so that the client when they when when they come come upon it.
[01:00:12] We already have it solved for them or we at least have a plan in place. So they're not picking up the phone and calling you.
[01:00:19] You're already have called them. And I think that really sums up the Bruin Bruin team quite effectively.
[01:00:27] Bruin real estate is where you can find Ryan's team on Instagram and also Ryan himself is Ryan J. Bruin on Instagram.
[01:00:35] We're going to have a link to those Instagram accounts as well as Ryan's a website for his team.
[01:00:45] So Ryan on behalf of all of our listeners, we thank you so much for your time today.
[01:00:52] You really gave us a lot of great ideas about how to automate our business, how to systematize, more importantly, how to plan.
[01:00:59] And I think that is really the key to most of the people I talk to, which are I only talk to top producers on this show.
[01:01:09] They all have a similar mantra, but you had to set it so succinctly. So this we appreciate on behalf of the audience. Thank you for that.
[01:01:18] And then I'm going to have to thank the audience. We appreciate you guys taking around to the end of the episode. Thank you.
[01:01:26] We appreciate our sponsors and we also want to thank our sponsors as well as for everyone listening, the best way that you can help us continue to grow our show is tele-friend.

[01:01:50] Leave us a review. We appreciate it. Let us know what you think of the show, how we can improve. We make the show for you.
[01:01:58] So tell us what we can do to get even better. Ryan, it was a pleasure chatting with you.
[01:02:03] Your team is crushing it and I love your energy and your positivity. And you guys it's really a fun.
[01:02:12] It seems like a fun team to work with. And you know if anyone by the way has people who move in and out of New Jersey.
[01:02:22] And they do, you know, there are people who have places up there who maybe don't live all the time up there.
[01:02:30] If you have a feeder market that goes in and out of New Jersey, you should reach out to Ryan because he has people that leave New Jersey as well.
[01:02:36] He has people that go down south and retired a Florida and other places.
[01:02:42] So you should reach out to them and make connections because his clients are might be moving to your area and your clients might be moving to his area, especially with the pricing in New York right now.
[01:02:51] So so Ryan's team is always busy. Ryan, thank you so much. And we appreciate you. And we will see everybody on the next episode. Thanks Ryan.
[01:03:05] Alright, thanks a lot DJ.

Now as a real estate recruiter, I can tell you the answer is always yes. But most agents aren't looking to move right now. So how do you know who to contact? Well, what if I were to tell you there's a recruiting and retention tool powered by artificial intelligence that shows you exactly which agents in your local market are looking to leave their brokerage right now.

He's going to talk about how he builds relationships with his sphere and he does an amazing job of this. You'll get a sense of that and you can take that right into your business. Before we do that, just a quick reminder, the best way that you can help us is by telling a friend about this show. Think of another agent that's struggling right now. And by the way, agents are struggling right now. It's a tough market. It most of the markets I for what fans tell me listeners tell me and even our own agents here in Chicago tell me that it is tough. We have low inventory. We have high interest rates. We have lots of people locked in at 3% mortgages who don't want to move. So there are challenges right now for agents and also, you know, the new compensation structures, you know, made things a little tougher. So let's help each other by sharing this podcast, letting other agents know there are solutions. And we talk to agents all the time every week on this podcast about how to overcome those challenges. Just send them a link to this episode or tell them to subscribe to the podcast or find us on YouTube or Spotify or wherever they find their podcasts. We would appreciate it. Also, if there's somebody in your market that you're like, I want to know what that person does. I don't know that person or I don't have access to that person, but they're crushing it. You tell us. You reach out to us and say, DJ, I want you to talk to someone. So we will find them. I will get to them. We will get them on our show because I want to help you learn what your, you know, your avatar, your person at the top of the mountain in your market is doing. I can get to them. I can get them on our show and I can do that for you. So just let me know who that is. And I'll reach out to them and we'll see if we can do an episode for those people or if you yourself are a top agent. You're like, I have a story to share. Hey, reach out to us. You know, we get pitched every single day by PR companies and, you know, publicists and just all sorts of different agents. You know, but we oftentimes REALTORS don't market themselves that much. So if you have a story to tell and you think it would be great on our podcast, let us know we'd always love to hear you. All right, let's get to it. My conversation with Ryan Brun. What's the best piece of real estate advice you ever received? So the best piece of real estate advice that I ever received I believe is I got it from my father and it wasn't exactly a quote so much as my father worked in real estate for his whole life. He worked in management at Coal Banker for ages started when he was young working for my grandfather's brokerage. And I remember when I, I think in my first year of real estate in Manhattan and I moved out here to New Jersey, teamed up with the family. And one of the things that I first noticed when I was setting up my marketing is we had these really nice custom bound books that we could put together a nice buying a machine in the office at my previous brokerage. And I came to a current brokerage at the time there were these outdated buying new machines that looked, you know, looked like they were about 20 years old. And I was complaining saying I can't believe that we don't have the nicer buying the machines. I felt it was really important. And, and you know, he said, listen, if it's that important, let's look into it and see what it costs. And if these buying the machines are going to be that value of your business, then you should go and buy one and figure out how to do it on your own. Don't wait for your brokerage to be able to provide it for you. And I did and at the time that was a really nice advantage that we had not a lot of people in our area were using that, but it also just really kickstarted the idea that hey, if you know, don't wait for somebody to do something for you or something to be provided for you, if it's important. If it's necessary, if it's going to boost your business, help your clients figure it out and find a way. Love it. Worst piece of advice you ever received in real estate. So I think the worst piece of my life I received was from him and some other agents that I knew in New Jersey back when I was starting in Manhattan real estate. I had a big network within the New Jersey real estate industry and a lot in him and a lot of the others at the time said, you know, good luck, but there's really not a lot of assistance and advice I can give you because we're in the suburbs, you're in the city and, you know, everything is different. And then after making the move here in New Jersey and working in the suburban market, I quickly learned that while there were many differences at the core of it, everything was kind of the same. So, you know, I kind of learned that however different markets might seem at the end of the day at the core of them, they really operate the same. And if you can get those core fundamentals down, you can operate in any different market environment. Perfectly said Ryan Bruin is our guest today. He is the team lead for the Bruin team servicing Morris and Somerset counties in New Jersey. He is the number one cold wall banker team in that area of New Jersey. Ryan takes the time to ensure that your property is marketed for greatest impact by specifically targeting this I love the right buyers.

And we will have links to that in the show notes. Ryan is also a smart home nerd who's obsessed with them with many technological technological advances that could make homes more efficient, convenient and comfortable. Ryan, welcome to the show. Thank you so much for having me DJ. I'm really excited to chat with you. I think. Well, I don't I'm sure I've had other New Jersey agents on I've done we've done over 600 maybe 700 episodes now I can't remember. And but I haven't talked to as many New Jersey people as I'd like and I always love talking to New Jersey agents because there's just in an authenticity to New Jersey that is very prevalent. But let's talk about it. So you come from a real estate family. What did you do beforehand? I've done a lot of things beforehand. Just before getting into real estate, I worked as an accountant, the license CPI. I still keep my CPA license active, even though I don't practice accounting anymore. But I did a wide variety of other things professionally and an amateur level from graphic design to film production worked up with this worked with a startup music business and not only helping to do some web design, but also business development and picture investors. So I really had a lot of, you know, varying experiences, you know, within the professional world before jumping into real estate. Yeah, you are clearly a creative guy as well. But also you you've really balanced both logic and creativity. So tell us about is that kind of your secret sauce is that you do both sort of the fun creative aesthetic stuff as well as the quantitative, you know, number crunching side. Yeah, and I wouldn't say it's just that I do the fun creative stuff and also the quantity of side. I really like to mix the two. I like to build. I like to create. I like to think outside of the box. So it's not just coming up with funny videos or creative marketing pieces. It's also using that creativity to, it's really take data, take analytics, take systems and processes and build and shape them in a way that helps myself my business and my team and my clients. Yeah, I love that. Tell us. So your father is in the business. He worked at Cole banker. He was in management. How did you always want to be a REALTOR or did it sort of know? Tell me the story. People always assume that because my family is in the business that's that I wanted to be in the business because of that. If anything, that probably kept me away from the business for a while, you know, growing up in it. I always just had this attitude of, all right, that's great. But like, you know, everybody wants better for themselves. They grew up with. So I thought, well, if they're doing that, then I think to find something bigger and better to be doing. But I really just have a great love for real estate. I, you know, I spent time in high school and college doing home renovations and construction. And then when I was living in Manhattan and New York City, working in the county, I found that, you know, I, I, well, my free time was spent walking around looking at the architecture, looking at the different types of homes. And even working on various clients, I had some clients that were law firms and, you know, in order to be in their financials and their escrow accounts. I just found myself quite up looking at, you know, building plans and, and floor plans and, and different purchase contracts rather than, you know, spending the bulk of my time where I was supposed to be in looking at the financial accounts. Yeah, it's, it's really interesting. You, you really seem to, to hover around a lot of different interests and those kind of nicely coalesced into a real estate agent position. And let's, let's talk a little bit about, you know, what's going on in your market right now. So I always like to talk about where the challenges are. Because every market has its challenges. I hear a lot of agents these days talking specifically about inventory. I don't know if inventory is an issue. So, yeah, so what I always think about is, you know, five years ago, we all refinanced into 3% mortgages or 4% or very low rate lending platforms. And, you know, we don't want to give that up. The homeowners or certainly we've been enjoying the benefits of not having to write those big checks every month. And it really creates a problem for homeowners who don't have to move, but could, could move because their homes appreciated, but maybe feel a little bit hamstrung because like, gosh, I don't, I don't know if I want a 7% mortgage. So I'm curious how you guys deal with it. I typically don't like to, so you, you know, you have to know me. You'll find that, you know, I don't look at problems at face value. So yes, most of the people you're talking to are saying that the problem is inventory, but the real problem lately is motivation, motivation to move. And one of the big factors behind that, yes, you're right, is the interest rates. A lot of people locked in at lower interest rates than this currently in the market. So it's really a motivation problem. It's not that people don't want to move. You know, the same old life events that motivated people to move in the past are still existing. However, a lot of the financial motivation behind that just isn't there anywhere from, you know, your upsellers who, while they would typically historically be more than willing to take on the additional financial burden, that additional financial burden has been increased to a point where that mostly emotional decision becomes much more financial decision. And then I think the biggest constraint on the market comes on the other end of the spectrum, which is the downsizers, the empty nesters who have homes that are too large for them, or, you know, not too large for them, but larger than they need. And, you know, not only is there no financial incentive to downsize, they might say, this is this homes much bigger than I need. Right. But why would I move to a, even though I don't need a house, this big one, I moved to a house half the size for the same amount of money. Yeah, that is a point, you know, you're the first agent to really bring that to my attention. I feel silly for not thinking about that before. That is the other side of that coin, which is absolutely the truth is, yeah, why am I going to downsize. I don't want to take care of this big giant house, but I got a pretty good deal on it. So yeah, and that's, I'm actually having that conversation with a lot of potential sellers right now that, you know, people who are at the age where they think they should be considering downsizing and they should be and you know, we sit down and they want to go over the finances and they assume that they're missing something because it looks like a pretty much a wash to go from a big house to a townhouse and, you know, I have to explain to them that at least around this area. It's less of a financial move and more of a lifestyle, you know, it is a lot of money, but you don't want to be, you have the money doesn't mean you want to be dealing with colon landscape or colon repair person, all that stuff. That's when it really comes into play. I agree. I also think that peace of mind, there's a cost associated with the feeling that you get when you walk into a home and rates go up and down and at the end of the day, it's just a number that comes out of your checkbook that, you know, if you budgeted correctly, you probably don't pay a ton of attention to other than you know it's there. And at the end of the day, if we're chasing numbers, like trying to say, it's almost like chasing the stock market, it's the best time to get into the stock market is when it crashes, right? And so, of course, that's the most time to buy a house is when you need a house. Exactly. And so, in waiting for the market to crash is interesting because when it does, you don't, it doesn't feel good to throw here. And then you can just throw your money into a stock after the companies misgirnings report. But like buying a house when it's increasing in value because I just spent a bunch of money, but it's going up in value. But no one feels if the market does go down, it doesn't feel good. But then also keeping in mind, if you look at the real estate market historically overall, you know, typically the up swings are bigger than the downs swings. You know, we've got years of the market going up and it's continuing to go up even on that appreciation has slowed down quite a bit. You know, but overall, if you look back, you had to be nice to hit that dip, but at the same time, historically we're probably going to look at this period and say, well, you know, yeah, we saw that small dip, but overall, if you go around now, you're probably going to be better for the market continues to behave as it has historically. Yeah, it is very interesting. While past performance does not guarantee future results, if we do look historically, the, you know, the home values have risen over the last 150 years in a way that's pretty much a straight line. It's not certainly not to the moon kind of levels, but you know, it is an investment that tends to gain equity over time. And as a result, and rates kind of do what they do and then they fluctuate and they change and you can have that conversation with the homeowner that says, you know, I don't, this isn't the perfect place for me, but I'm locked in at 3%. I don't want to get rid of it. And I think maybe the conversation is, well, I understand that who wants to get rid of that nobody, but if all the sudden rates came down to 5% today, here's what would happen. That right, right, you don't want to be jumping everybody who's waiting just like you is going to jump into the market and it's going to be a mess because prices will go out of control because everybody's waiting for that exact moment. So perhaps it perhaps it's even smarter, although maybe doesn't feel as comfortable to make that push now and sort of weather a little bit of that storm, knowing that rates, you know, kind of fluctuate from time to time. And if they dip at a point, maybe you can refinance, you know, do something responsible with your money, but you're buying maybe add a, I don't know if discounts are right word, but certainly not at a premium. Right, right. I think, I mean, I agree with you, you know, obviously add a bit of caution in there, you know, when the phrase rates first went up from their extremos, I think there were a lot of agents who were mistakenly running around saying, you know, marry the house, date the rate. Don't worry, it's just temporary. You know, I was, I was not a big fan of that whole, you know, campaign going on. Well, I did believe that at some point rates would stabilize or possibly come down. I thought that was a pretty ambitious gamble to be running around telling everybody to make. So you certainly do have to make sure that, you know, if you're going to buy the home and the rates are higher that you can afford it and you're not gambling on, you know, then coming down in a certain amount of time to be able to fit into your budget. But, you know, I forget where I heard it, but I heard a quote that said, you know, there's no such thing as a bad real estate investment. And, you know, there's a good time to buy or a bad time to buy. It's just, you know, a varying amount of time that you have to hold on to that piece of real estate before it becomes a good investment. Yeah. So, you know, if you buy it super low, great, you know, maybe the market flips around and you make a ton of money quickly, but, you know, if you buy it, what would be. You probably considered in that point in time, a high point, you hold on to it long enough, you'll be looking back saying, wow, that was a great deal. I think people too often look at their primary residence as an asset. And I oftentimes, I think of it not as an asset until the day you sell it. Right. Because it costs money. And in the definition of the word, it appreciates. But overall, you're right. I don't think most people should, people should not be looking at their primary home as an asset. Right. They should be looking at as a lifestyle choice. I think home ownership is great. I think the best reasons for owning a home are not an investment standpoint. Financial either are some benefits in the sense where you have some stability in terms of your payment. I think it is more financially sound than renting while you do have millions of causes that can fluctuate and you do have taxes that can go up. Overall, you know, it's a lot more stable in terms of locking in your month of payment for the long term than renting where you don't know what your landlord's going to do. But I think it's, I think, I think especially lately, so many people have focused on the financial. Everybody wants to be an investment guru. And I think that that's the wrong way to approach owning a primary home. There are so many reasons. While it is, you know, in many ways financially beneficial, there are so many reasons that owning a home is beneficial to you, your health, your family, the development of your family, the community. I think those are really the primary reasons for owning the home. And if you literally look granular at, you know, what your investment gurus would consider to be a good investment, it doesn't fall into that. I wouldn't say the bad investment, but it certainly doesn't fall into the category with a lot of the other things that we consider to be, you know, great places to park our money. Yeah, I 100% agree with you. And let's talk about the Bruin team. So you come from this real estate team, you were one of the top teams really in all of New Jersey. And I would love to hear what makes your team special. Like what do you think you're doing that gives you more, more leverage maybe than other firms? Yeah, I think to really best summarize what I think we're doing that sets us apart is we're proactive. We're not waiting around for, you know, to be told what to do and what to think. I think that's always been a nice value value proposition of ours. But especially in the last five years when the market's been unpredictable, interest rates have been unpredictable. Legislation has been unpredictable. Technology has been unpredictable, not only the unpredictable, but volatile, all these things. We really pride ourselves in, you know, as we mentioned before, figuring it out, figuring it out fast, not waiting for somebody else to come and, you know, and rescue us, so to speak. And, you know, every time the market shifts legislation changes, mortgage rates change. While it's challenging and stressful, I've looked at all of those changes as an opportunity to get ahead of the competition. If everything stays the same, well, then it's hard to set yourself apart because you might be quick to learn and really ambitious. But the same person and set around doing nothing, after a certain amount of time they're going to know the same amount of you. If the market keeps changing, the rules keep changing. The agents who are willing to work hard to adapt, to think for themselves and not follow the playbook. So to speak, I think we really have an opportunity to get ahead and provide that added value. Because at the end of the day, if the market's not changing, how much do our clients really need us to? Because eventually they'll figure it out. So the volatility of the market and the way that we communicate into business has really been a great opportunity for us as a team who's really into constantly change and learn and adapt. I like how you said you stay ahead of your clients. That is a really nice, simple mantra to think about what do I know today that my clients do not know? And then how do I share that information with them? How do I provide that to them? How do I proactively reach out so that they don't learn it via another method or something else? And go ahead. I also think you can take that down to the simplest level. I mean, overall, yes, we're talking about things like how to navigate the market, how to get an offer accepted in a 20 offer situation. How to figure out what the new legislation needs before anybody's had any formal classes or trainings. But I think you can really take a time to the simple stuff too. I look at my own consumer behavior and I've realized there's times where different pieces of the transaction, different times within just a simple transaction, or have my clients reach not to me the questions. And there have been plenty of times where I'd say, all right, you know, closing's coming up. I need to, you know, get the utility and photo of my clients so they know how to set up their utility accounts. Well, I realized if that client then calls me as I'm dialing their phone number. And I say, hey, so glad you just called. I was actually just dialing your phone number to tell you this exact piece of information. And there had one or two things that's happening. They're either thinking, yes, you're lying to me. If I didn't call you, then who know that I would have had to figure this out myself. Or even on top of that is what we'll call it. Sorry, I don't like it. So number one, I have, but on top of that, today's consumer, especially the younger clientele. I find they really don't want to be a bother as much as they're paying you to do this stuff. They they worry about being a bother. So especially with the younger clientele, if they called me to ask me that question, even if I was about to call them. Chances are they were thinking and worrying about that for at least a couple days before they gained the courage to say, you know what? I've given enough chances to get on top of this and now I'm going to ask them. So I tried to, you know, the past it was I tried to address things as they become relevant. And I've learned to adjust my systems and processes to address things before they come to mind in to the client's mind, not relevant. So something we're in a point in transaction where a piece of information is not relevant for me to burden my client with for until another month from now. And there's other things we should be focusing on, but I found that consumers typically at this point in time start thinking and wondering about it. That that's when it needs to be addressed because while I'm trying to get them on board with all these other things, they're sitting there worrying about something else that we're not at yet. That is incredibly important pieces that you understand the emotional and the logical process of a home buyer and home seller and where they are in that process. You are ahead of them in the sense of I know what's coming and I'm going to address that before you, Mr. Mrs. a consumer address it. Because like you said, when by the time they bring it to your attention, you're right, days have gone by, they've already thought about it, they may be they googled it, they've wanted to find the answer on their own. You're right, younger, younger people don't want to pick up the phone and call you first. They want to get an answer on their own first. They're going to look it up and then they might get confused and then they might need a real answer by calling you to get the final answer. So what you're doing is actually quite profound. It's thinking ahead of the game and really just being ahead of everyone and thinking, okay, what's coming up, what can I prepare for, what can I prepare my clients for so that they don't have to Google something, they don't have to call me that they are, oh yeah, that, you know, that makes perfect sense. Okay, that's what's coming cool. I think the being prepared is really part of your secret sauce. And also understanding that if it's important to them, it's important. I've had certain clients where the one spouse says, you know, excuse my husband or wife, they're going to have all these dumb questions about things that are not important and understand, you know, I've had to explain to them that if it's something they're worried about, then it's important. Yeah, I love that. Let's, I know you're also really into smart home and tech to make homes more, more efficient. Talk about where, where you see that headed heading and what, how do you utilize that in your practice? Yeah, so I think technology in general, I have a pretty interesting approach. I think a lot of people that may not be as, as eager to adopt technological advances, at least now a day might make the arguments of everybody's got their heads buried in the screen. And we need to be more present in the real world. In my opinion, technological advances, especially in a smart home realm, do just that. They don't, they take us out of a screen. They put us more in the real world. I think good smart home technology and technology that I used to support my business as well should get us all out from behind the computer. They should be more voice activated and then in terms of screens, they should be more intuitive than, you know, reactive. And so I think there's a lot of efficiencies and conveniences to be had with, with smart home technology, especially as, as much as we like to write at this point in time, complain about how homes are so expensive and getting a being able to afford a home that's a reasonable size for a family is difficult. So if we look historically, our homes currently are much larger than homes of past generations, you know, some of the houses that we might consider to be normal or slightly larger than normal. And you know, in the, you know, in centuries past would have had full staff. You know, now we have people buying these larger homes that might be more mainstream for today, but larger homes with the expectation and the budget to maintain them on their own. And so I think smart home technology is really important for making that possible. Otherwise, a lot of these homes will be overwhelming. And, you know, whether it would be a physical burden, financial burden, and falling to disappear. Yeah, I agree. I, I, but the idea of being more present is a really interesting concept because you know, I was thinking about it as you were saying voice activation commands in particular. So I have my home wired for why use Google Home Assistant. And while it's, it's certainly not as perfect as I would prefer it to be. It does respond most of the time fairly well. And I just have to talk to it to turn things on, off dim, etc. I can turn on an off and appliances. And it allows me to maintain a conversation with somebody and just pause for a second while I bark out the command into, to the air. And it seems sort of like novelty. Maybe like, oh, that's kind of a neat little trick. But it was fun to be able to show off to your friends. But it certainly is cool. Like I can tell my shades to go down and that is fun. But the reality of it is it does, it does change or it lengthens the amount of being able to be present the time I can be present. So it does actually help in a way to allow me to continue what I was doing beforehand with another human being. And the simple things in terms of enjoying our home, like think about it. You know, agents, we all know if you're showing a house, what do you do before a showing you, you'll close all the open all the shades and you turn the lights on. And you don't do it when the clients there, you want them to walk in and be able to see that sunlight coming in and really be able to see and enjoy the aesthetics of that home. And as homeowners, you want the same feeling, you come home from work, you want to walk in the door, you want to be able to walk into a well-lit comfortable home that's a comfortable temperature, enjoy your beautiful views. And smart home technology allows that to where before you either keeping your shades open and your lights on, which you're not going to do, you'll leave the house or you're walking in a dark, dreary, you know, home. You want to be greeted by your home, you don't want to have to walk in and decide. I mean, before smart home technology is like, I'm going to run upstairs and grab something and I'm going to do it in the dark because I don't want to run around and all the lights, which is I want to walk in a room and deal with. I want to see everything, see the light coming in or even waking up in the morning, you want to wake up and have that sunlight hit you before you get out of bed. You know, it's really being present in your home and in the world around you. Yeah, as you're talking about that, I realize I do a lot of those things where I do have my lights turn on before I walk into my house. Because I set it up that way, I have them also turn on in conjunction with the, with the sunset. So I know that they're they turn on a certain amount of time before the sun sets. And you know, it again, you're right, it does create an experience. And for for realters, this is something that if your clients have these sort of technologies, you can utilize these and showings. If you if you have the lens, if you are able to plug into that, you could actually deliver these experiences to people on a showing. But yeah, I actually when I when I sold my last my, when I moved last home, I was selling, I had it so that you know, it was activated by the smart locks when that person unlocked the door. It turned all the lights on, opened all the shades and actually greeted them said, welcome to your new home. Oh, it's great. And I really feel I mean, someone who for someone who loves homes, I feel that, you know, that that perfect environment should be greeting us when we walk in the door, because that's when it matters most. Oh, I love that. I love that. I'm getting ready to sell my condo. I'm going to think about how when somebody comes to the showing, I can, what I won't be there, but it would be great to have them go, welcome to your new home in a way that's. Yeah, it's funny. Go ahead. Having a smart home, it's fun. It's funny. How much stuff I have to do for my clients that I don't have to do my own home, the amount of times where it's, hey, we went away on vacation. We've got back to back showings and I've got to go drive over to their house to turn up all the lights for the night when I'm like, well, if they just had a little smart home tech like I did, they'd be able to just go on my phone and hit the button and be done with it. Yeah, it's it's remarkably inexpensive to it's amazing how how you can do this for for very little. Right. It's not key, but, but you know, if you look, I remember actually with this past holiday season, watching, I think it was home alone for and the whole premise of the whole thing was that his dad was dating this very wealthy woman where her home was automated and just laughing because my daughter's looking. It's supposed to be exciting for these kids to see like wow, this lady's so rich that like she can tell her shades open and they open and my daughter's looking at me like what's the big deal. Let's talk about the face to face interactions that you and your clients have. How do you maintain your relationships with clients so that in between their home sales, they don't forget about you. Yeah, so I think one of the cornerstones of my marketing is client, client relationships. I'd say a lot of agents seem to focus a lot on new lead generation. I focus a lot more of my energy on client relationship management. Every home that I sell, I want to be the beginning of a long term relationship with that client and not just a transaction. I want every client of mine to come back to me for every home seller purchase for themselves for the family and recommend or refer to me. I do a lot in the traditional sense in terms of birthday cards and home anniversary cards and holiday cards and things of that sort. I'm always trying to improve this piece. I try to make a big effort to bring them into my family so to speak. One of the benefits of working in this business is I get to work with so many great people. The process of purchasing or selling a home is such an intimate process that you really become very close with these individuals. I try to, not only for my business purposes, for me personally as well, to maintain those relationships. I think one of the toughest parts about my business is about this business is that you're working with a home buyer. You could be working with them for months. You're really having personal conversations. You're part of one of the biggest life events for them and then you close and it's like for both of us, it's like when am I going to see it? We've been hanging out every weekend and having some really great fun and conversations. I try to keep it less formal. I've done some of these client appreciation events. As my business grows, it's a little bit tougher, but I try to keep it more personal and make sure that I get together with my various clients no matter how long it's been since they've purchased or sold the home and make it a little bit more personal, one to one, getting dinner, going to the pool, playing some golf rather than some big generic event or communication campaign that's just, hey, I'm sending this to you and everybody else. I like it. So you're doing the more small get-togethers and personalized. I like that. How does that translate for you? Again, you're not doing it to get more business, but it does result in more business. It's a factor and it's definitely valuable because I think some of the more generic types of communication that we use to keep in touch with clients and state, quote unquote, stay top of mind. We might continually be in their faces, but let's face it. Everybody we know knows five other REALTORS. So just being top of mind isn't always enough. You need to keep reminding them of it helps the constant reminder of the relationship that you have, the value that you've provided, the care that you take in them and their lives and their goals. I don't think that you can necessarily accomplish that with some of these more generic marketing campaigns we do. It's nice in between to keep your face in front of them, but if you're not tying that in with more personal touches, then I don't think it's going to be as effective. Not to mention people, like we said, people don't want to bother you. A lot of these, a lot of people are thinking of fine or selling a home long before they actually think of reaching out to an agent. So having those personal events, personal communications, personal get together, allows these people to pick your brain where they may not have picked up the phone and call it you otherwise. Yeah, it makes perfect sense. I love the idea of the proactive personal touch is, you know, every, like you said, every person knows five REALTORS. They're getting five REALTOR newsletter emails each month. They're also, you know, probably getting a few mailers here and there. And, you know, maybe even a few texts here and there, but how many of those other agents that you're technically still competing with are picking up the phone and calling the person say, hey, how are you doing or what's going on with, you know, your business or how are things at work or how are the kids or whatever it might be. That personal touch, that proactive reach out or just share some information. Hey, I was thinking about you. I'm going to send you an updated value of your home so that you can see what I think your home is worth right now. I know you look on Zillow, like everybody, but let me, let me take a crack at it. Yeah, and it's not just evaluations. It's in a more personal level, I think about like, you know, I get excited for these clients, you know, they all have their personal interests and these homes are all unique. And finding the right home for them is often extremely exciting for me. You know, so I want to know not just, I want to keep in touch, not just so I can, you know, keep them informed of their value of their home and what's going on with the market. But like, hey, like you were super excited to put a pool in that backyard. Did you put a pool in yet or like, you know, you were imagining having your daughter's birthday party with pony rides in that backyard. Like, is that happening? I better be getting an invite because I was super excited for, you know, I was just as excited with that idea as you were. So, you know, it's really, it's much more personal than just dollars and cents and transactions. It's these homes, like we said, it's not, it's not an investment in the true sense of the word. It's a lifestyle choice person in these homes. And I love to keep in touch with my clients and see how they're using their homes and how they're enjoying their homes that they, you know, put so much time and effort. We all put so much time and effort to be a little bit cheaper. How important is it for you to keep your CRM up to date with all of this information? Very important. At the end of the day, you know, every year that I'm in this business, I meet more people, I sell more houses. And, you know, I wouldn't call myself old yet, especially by industry standards, but, you know, more information going into this brain and I'm sure as yours continue to go by the output is not going to, is going to dimension at some point. So keeping all this information somewhere easily accessible that can assist me is super important. Yeah. And, you know, this, and it also gives you a reference point, it gives you data to, to, you know, talking points when you contact these people, you now have things to chat about. How often are you doing outreach to your existing clients? Not as often as I should be. You know, I use birthdays and home anniversaries and holidays as benchmarks. My goal is to have those not be the only or reach out. But I would like to do it more frequently. I think one of my biggest challenges is that intention and desire to make it personal and relevant and authentic sometimes keeps me from reaching out as often as I should. That's where my CRM and my systems really help come into play, not to replace or depersonalize the experience for them or for me, but to be able to keep me on top of it. I would say one of the benefits of working in this business, you know, some people like to say, oh, real estate agents, you know, every relationship is fake. And it's, it's so they can totally sell you home. I look at this the other way around. One of the benefits of this business is it forces me to maintain these relationships that I value, but maybe won't put as much instinctively put as much effort into maintaining. And, you know, I'm lucky enough as a part of our job to be forced to come up with better ways to keep these relationships going. So, you know, I try to keep, I try to implement more outreach to my clients that are more personalized to them and their needs, their life situations and steer away from the generic. I love it. Walk us through a, I know, no, no day is typical for an agent, but what of those fundamental activities that you do every day? So, when I first wake up, I kept my email, one of the systems and automations that I put into places, I, my transaction dashboard transaction management system that I built myself sends myself and everyone in my team a daily reminder of everything that you need to do that day. And in the next seven days, whether it be confirming a mortgage commitment, reaching out to someone for their birthday, things like that. So, that's the first thing I check to see that and my calendar to see what the day has ahead of me. And then I check my phone for birthdays. I want to see who's birthday is, who I can reach out to, wish them a happy birthday. And then from there, it's, you know, this is all before I breakfast. I have my set up on notifications, everybody that is in my contacts. I make sure that I'm, if there's any home sale activity within their neighborhood that I'm notifying of that first. The house came on the market, the house just sold in the neighborhood of somebody that's in my contacts. I'm letting them know. Trying to be the first one that they hear from. I want somebody. That is a profound, that is a profound tip, everyone. If you didn't just hear that, what Ryan's doing, that's a great idea. So Ryan has his, he has, he has alert set up for his CRM for any home activity, new listings, maybe pendings, the closes, whatever, whatever is relevant to that person. He's got it set up so that he can say, hey, I just saw this thing happen in your area. Yeah, if, you know, if the house came on the market down the street from them, I want them to hear from me before they wake up, get dressed, fall their driveway and drive them to see that sign in front of it. I love that. Are you doing that via text via call, how do you do that? Email, I do that via email. And I think most of us have our clients or our active buyers set up on home alerts. It's simple. You set yourself up on home alerts, create an alert for every single one of your clients or for every neighborhood in the group those clients by neighborhood. You know, it's easy enough. It's helpful not only for sending them emails and texts, you know, keep them up on it. But even if you're not doing that, set yourself up on those alerts for every single client. So that way, I mean, what's worse than, you know, you go to a happy hour and you bump into someone you know. And they start asking you about the house that just came on the market on their street that day and you know nothing about it. Right. Anybody that you know, you should know what's going on in their neighborhood. And it's easy enough with automated alerts. Boy, that is a really, really smart idea. And I think, I think you're wrong that most agents don't do that. And I think that fact that you do it is incredible. And I encourage everyone in our audience to set yourself up for what with these alerts because again, someone isn't going to sell their home for the next seven to nine years possibly. But, but everyone's always curious what are the home down the street. They have friends. Yep. You know, if you bump into them at a cocktail party and you know, a bunch of information about the house down the street that just came on the market and their friend was thinking about moving to the area. Well, you know, if they showed up and you knew a bunch of information about it, they're much more likely to send them your right. I'll pull back the curtain a little bit on my I recruit REALTORS or a living, but REALTORS can take what I do and apply it to their own business. So I have a little trick. It's not a trick really. It's something anybody could do. I do a version of this. So when when I see an agent that I want to recruit over to our company, I see that they got a new listing. I so my version of what you're talking about is I send them a text. Hey, I just saw you got a new listing over on Polk Street. Congratulations. Yeah, I said I'm a text. I don't ask them for anything. I just give them a little like that a boy. You know, good job. And, you know, I do that for a couple of reasons. One, I'm genuinely proud or excited for them. Right. To, I also want to be the first person to tell them that I saw that they did something great. Right. And, you know, and three, it might start a conversation. It might start a conversation about, oh, tell me tell me what's going on. Are you happy at your brokerage or brokerage? I'm good care of you because they might think gosh, my own broker just in congratulating me. Right. So this is the same way that REALTORS can can really start to find new clients is, you know, when you just because you didn't sell somebody a home doesn't mean you can't provide value to them. Does it mean you can't notice? Hey, I just saw this thing happened in your neighborhood. I thought you might be interested in it or, you know, and now with AI, you could really set up a lot of these automations to run and have AI scour the internet and find information for you and say, oh, I just saw that, you know, in your neighborhood that this event just happened or this event's coming up. And I thought you might be interested in. Yeah, and the key is relevance, you know, we're all getting hit with a ton of information. No one is starving for information, what we're starving for is relevant information. Yeah. That's a really good point. Relevant information. I love that. And that's what why you should have a really detailed CRM so that you can know specifically what's of interest to each of the people in your database. And you know, what we're really talking about in Ryan, it seems like this entire conversation has been mostly about deepening connection. How do we deepen connection with people? And we're so lucky that we have these tech products that a lot of them largely are free that allow us to organize this information where our brains aren't going to remember everything's perfectly. So we can leverage technology to remind us, hey, it's someone's birthday at someone's home anniversary. Hey, this thing just happened in their neighborhood or, you know, I got to reach out to you. You go to a broker open house and you see something cool about the house. Oh, it's got a really cool wine cell. Well, people I know that are really into wine. Let me send them a quick photo and say check out this house. They may not be buying that house, but hey, look, I'm in this house a really cool wine cell. I know you love wine or your big band of basketball. Look at this person's house and they had a, you know, Jersey signed by Michael Jordan. Like isn't that cool, you know, super boring or something, you know, it's not just, hey, here's, here's a house in your neighborhood. That's valuable, but get as granular as you can. Hey, I know that you can afford to buy a house more than $800,000. And you're not even in the market right now, but I'm just in this $10 million house that had a full basketball court. And it would that be awesome. You love basketball. Yeah, it's this I'm thinking about you. And, and we all are desperately, you know, hungry for the I think about you. Yes, it is. And they don't the good news is the, here's the bad news. The bad news is they take a bit of work to do. The good news is that they're worth it because they're very infrequent. So, yeah, so if you can put a couple of minutes into a genuine reach out for and Ryan, we haven't mentioned anything about, hey, have you, you know, any sort of salesmanship. This is we're talking about, you know, building relationships, maintaining relationships, keeping relationships and doing things that are actually in the client's interest so that they want to respond to you. Yeah, that, that this is really I see this as the key to what the brewing group has, has done your team has been very, very successful. And I can see that that you're always looking for opportunities to connect. Yeah, absolutely, absolutely. Well, I have, it's a challenging market right now. We talked about inventories a little tighter than we would like. Of course, people are maybe sitting on the sidelines because of rates more often than they should. And, you know, but you're right, life happens. So tell me a little bit about what are the proactive things you're doing right now just to keep the business running. Well, two things. Number one, when things do get slower, I work on my business. Sometimes when it gets busy, you're I'm so busy working in the business. I don't have as much time to work on the business. Yeah. So, and when things get slow, the first opportunity I take is let's look at my systems, my processes, our day to day, our budgets. Where can we refine and improve that because the business is always going to turn around. It's always going to pick up a good be tomorrow, could be next month, be next year. And let's put ourselves in the best position to take advantage of that because I feel like if we, you know, when it gets slower, yeah, people would run around and make attempts to generate business that's not there. And there's only so much that you do, but I always look at the best thing you can do to make these slower times easier is make sure you don't let anything slip through the cracks when it's busy. When you're super busy and a deal falls through or you forget to call somebody or you miss an opportunity, you're too busy and joy in the, you know, the great year you're having to really feel that. And then the next year when you're sitting there saying, oh, business is down, you're looking and saying, well, you know, business is down now. It would have been nice if I had closed that one extra deal that I let's sit through the cracks last year. So there are things I do to drum up business within, you know, during the slow times. But I'd say my biggest focus during the slow times is put things into place to be able to make sure that things don't fall into the cracks when it's busy when it might be easier, you know, fix your, fix your net when the fish aren't fighting because, you know, when they're fighting, you want to be able to grab as many as you can. Yeah, that boy, that's a great analogy. It's such a such a smart thing. It's, it's don't, don't they, it's the expression the worst time to learn how to fight is when you're in the middle of the fight. Like don't learn to fight while you're in a fight, learn beforehand. Right. You know, so that you can prepare. So we're talking about preparation and what I love about your process and your team's process is that you know what you're doing every day. And in fact, you might not even know what you're doing every day, but there's a system that knows what you're going to do every day and it tells you, right, you're going to do this, right, you're going to do this, this, this, this, this. And then you can just execute the plan. And of course, life is going to get in the way anyway and screw up the day as it does. But at least you know where your true North is. Oh, I have to get back on this plan. I have to go back to X, Y and Z. I have to do some prospecting. I have to do some client maintenance. I have to evaluate my finances. I have to, you know, we have to do all run the business. Right. There's a lot of that stuff that can be done ahead of time. You know, we all think we're so busy and we are. But out of those things that you're doing that you're busy, how much of that stuff is repetitive, how much that stuff can be planned for. You know, if the majority of the questions you get from your clients are similar, all right. Well, you know, when you're slow and you have time sit and slowly and thoughtfully put together that response to that question. So when it comes up, you have the response ready to go. You know, with certain contracts, usually time sensitive, they need to be sent out. Well, can you put together a template where certain information is filled out already in short in that time. When you're busy and you need to be done urgently. Yeah, I really see your team as an educator. You guys are constantly thinking about what's, you know, what's in front of us. What's the next thing that's going to be here. It'll be here soon. So let's prepare for it. Let's get it ready so that the client when they when when they come come upon it. We already have it solved for them or we at least have a plan in place. So they're not picking up the phone and calling you. You're already have called them. And I think that really sums up the Bruin Bruin team quite effectively. Bruin real estate is where you can find Ryan's team on Instagram and also Ryan himself is Ryan J. Bruin on Instagram. We're going to have a link to those Instagram accounts as well as Ryan's a website for his team. So Ryan on behalf of all of our listeners, we thank you so much for your time today. You really gave us a lot of great ideas about how to automate our business, how to systematize, more importantly, how to plan. And I think that is really the key to most of the people I talk to, which are I only talk to top producers on this show. They all have a similar mantra, but you had to set it so succinctly. So this we appreciate on behalf of the audience. Thank you for that. And then I'm going to have to thank the audience. We appreciate you guys taking around to the end of the episode. Thank you.

And you guys it's really a fun. It seems like a fun team to work with. And you know if anyone by the way has people who move in and out of New Jersey. And they do, you know, there are people who have places up there who maybe don't live all the time up there. If you have a feeder market that goes in and out of New Jersey, you should reach out to Ryan because he has people that leave New Jersey as well. He has people that go down south and retired a Florida and other places. So you should reach out to them and make connections because his clients are might be moving to your area and your clients might be moving to his area, especially with the pricing in New York right now. So so Ryan's team is always busy. Ryan, thank you so much. And we appreciate you. And we will see everybody on the next episode. Thanks Ryan. Alright, thanks a lot DJ.
