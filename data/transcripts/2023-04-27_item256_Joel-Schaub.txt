[00:01:12] And now, onto our show.
[00:01:26] Welcome to another episode of Keeping It Real, the largest podcast made by real estate agents and
[00:01:32] for real estate agents. My name is DJ Paris. I am your guide and host through the show today.
[00:01:37] Once again, is our monthly series called Learn with a Lender with Joel Shobb, one of my favorite
[00:01:42] people in the whole planet. So you're so lucky to get to listen to Joel because I am lucky to get
[00:01:47] to listen to Joel. He's from Guaranteed Rate. Let's talk about Joel. Joel is the vice president of
[00:01:53] lending a Guaranteed Rate. He's been doing loans at a high level since 2003. He's got to that level
[00:01:57] because of what he does specifically for agents, which is he gives back part of his commission to the
[00:02:03] buyer on every transaction. Last year alone, Joel gave back over $300,000 in closing costs to his
[00:02:10] buyers who worked with them. And that put his volume in the top one 10th of one percent of all
[00:02:16] lenders nationwide. By the way, if you're watching this, you're probably listening. But Joel's
[00:02:21] lovely wife, Christine just walked back and forth. And I feel sad that I was talking because I
[00:02:26] would have loved to have said, high Christine, we love you. Everybody loves you. But anyway, back to Joel.
[00:02:34] And let's see, where were we? Oh, Joel is in the top one 10th of one percent of all lenders
[00:02:39] nationwide. In fact, out of 400,000 loan officers in the country, Joel is in ranked number 137.
[00:02:46] Last year, he closed 319 transactions. That was 2022. His highest amount every crushed it.
[00:02:56] He's doing well this year as well. He's just constantly doing it. Joel is a legend here in the
[00:03:02] Chicago land area. But guaranteed rate is license in all 50 states. So if you, meaning our
[00:03:10] listeners are watching, viewing, watching, listening rather, are wanting a better relationship with a
[00:03:16] lender. Somebody that can actually help you grow your business. Joel's job and his team are the
[00:03:22] kings of that. They want to talk to you. And even if you're not going to work with them directly,
[00:03:27] they have an amazing email list that we're going to get you to subscribe to because it'll give you
[00:03:32] some talking points you can use with your clients. But if you are looking for a loan officer,
[00:03:37] we cannot highly recommend Joel. He's the very best we've ever worked with. He did my mortgage.
[00:03:44] I've sent people to him. He's the very best out there. No full stop. Joel can be reached.
[00:03:50] Reach out to him at his email, Joel at rate.com, Joel at rate.com. Or you can shoot him a text
[00:03:56] message or call him at 773 6542049. Let's say hello to the biggest cubs fan. I know Joel.
[00:04:04] Job. Joel, welcome. DJ, thanks so much for having me on. I love it when we go through the numbers.
[00:04:10] But I really like being here and giving back. And this is what we were talking about. Before we
[00:04:15] got on the air, it's being able to educate and learn just one or two more things that'll help agents
[00:04:21] close another deal or help a fire or maybe even get another seller. So I'm excited.
[00:04:26] I want to start, but we always put the plugs at the end. I want to put the plug at the beginning
[00:04:30] this time because speaking of giving back you and your team put out, Joel, this is so funny. I
[00:04:36] have to actually interrupting my own story because I started to send this to you earlier this morning
[00:04:40] in an email. I got an email from a very, very famous, like a famous mortgage lender, kind of a
[00:04:48] celebrity mortgage lender on the East Coast. I won't mention his name. He's apparently a very nice
[00:04:53] person. Somehow I got on his email list. He sent me the longest email full. I mean, it was just
[00:04:59] chock full of stuff. And I looked at it in my mind. Sort of I went dizzy. And it was just so much
[00:05:06] content in one email that I literally was like, I don't know what to do with this. And I was going
[00:05:11] to send it to you because I was thinking, I'm so glad you don't do that. But you do have an email
[00:05:18] that you send out every week that your team sends out that literally gives you several different
[00:05:24] data points of what's going on in the mortgage world and the lending world. And so I want everybody
[00:05:29] who's listening to our show to subscribe to that because I've seen what other lenders send. And
[00:05:33] it's not that good. But what you send is awesome. So where can people go to subscribe to that?
[00:05:39] On DJ we call that information overload, right? There's just too much information out there. And
[00:05:48] talking to them about interest rates. And it's it's all lagging data, right? They literally are
[00:05:54] being told one week. Vorgas rates went up and they're actually lower than they were the
[00:05:58] pre-rate. And so having some bite-sized education pieces that you can look at weekly, make all the
[00:06:06] difference in the world if you're an agent. And we've created that list. So you can literally
[00:06:11] subscribe by just sending an email to Joel at rate.com and say, sign me up for your newsletter.
[00:06:17] And on a weekly basis we give you digestible DJ. Things that you can speak to in terms of
[00:06:24] not just the rates, but different programs and trends that are happening so that you can see
[00:06:29] on top of the market and do it in a way that sets you apart from others in your market.
[00:06:35] Awesome. Well, everyone go send that email to Joel at rate.com and they will get you on their
[00:06:41] email list. And then you, when you're talking to your clients and they ask what's going on in the
[00:06:46] lending world, you will have bullet points and you will not have to, oh, I have to send you this
[00:06:51] email. There was like 70 videos in the email. Anyway, tons and tons of stuff. It's information
[00:06:56] overload, but that is not what we do on this show. We distill down to the most important details
[00:07:02] because REALTORS and lending are intricately related and connected and one depends on the other.
[00:07:09] And we all need more business. So what's going on? What should we be talking about this month?
[00:07:16] Well, we got an action-packed show because right now there's so much volatility in terms of
[00:07:21] interest rates. And so it's really important if you're an agent to kind of be on top of what's
[00:07:26] going on in the market because buyers are asking, right? Should I wait right now with rates being too high?
[00:07:33] If you're an agent listening to this, I know you've heard that. A buyer says, I think I'm going to
[00:07:37] wait until rates come down before we buy. And DJ, the problem with that is when rates do come down,
[00:07:44] we're going to see a flood of buyers back into the market. And we already know that the data
[00:07:50] points for the Fed are indicating that we're going to drop rates over 100 basis points next year.
[00:07:56] So you're hearing it first that Fed probably has gone too far already, but they have to stay on
[00:08:03] track at least this year with the rate increases. And as soon as it's done, we will see a big drop.
[00:08:09] That doesn't mean that clients need to wait until that day to get into the market, even though we
[00:08:14] don't really like this phrase of buy the home, right? Where you're getting in, and I don't even like this,
[00:08:21] but it's married the home and date three. Okay. However, you can literally use this exact same
[00:08:28] strategy, whether rates are going to drop in six months or two years. We shouldn't be buying just
[00:08:33] specifically because of rate. And you know that. Yeah, it's, you know, it's so amazing. So we were
[00:08:39] looking at our numbers at our brokerage today. We have over 700 agents and this, this peel back,
[00:08:45] the curtain a little bit. We were looking at our numbers and we saw something that kind of stuck
[00:08:50] out at us. And it was really, really interesting. And so last week with our agents, we only had
[00:08:56] nine new listings, which was very, very low for us. We're like, oh, wow, that's really low. This,
[00:09:01] or I'm sorry, two weeks ago, nine, nine listings. Last week, 21 new listings. And we looked and were like,
[00:09:08] what's going on? Is it the spring market? Is it, it's, it's a lot of things, right? And the good news is,
[00:09:15] it's a great time to list your property because yes, there's, there's a little bit more competition.
[00:09:20] But rates are not, again, I just, I don't think six and a half percent or six even even higher than
[00:09:27] six percent is something to cry about. I just don't think it is. I think we need to readjust.
[00:09:32] We need to reeducate our, our, our buyers and say, hey, this is where it is. And there isn't a
[00:09:39] whole lot of inventory. It's starting to ramp up a little bit. But I still think, I, I still think
[00:09:44] rates are fine. And there's a lot of ways to get rates that are lower. Okay. So let's just have
[00:09:49] a conversation here. Buyers aren't shocked anymore. Their rates are in the low sixes. That's
[00:09:54] absolutely one of the things that I'm hearing more and more is, yeah, I expected that. This is
[00:10:00] news unlike last year where it was every single week. It continued to go up and it was a shock to people.
[00:10:06] Now it's kind of the norm, but there's a lot of ways right now to get rates that are lower than
[00:10:12] six percent. So if you're an agent, you want to have your clients look at two things. It's not
[00:10:18] just a 30 year fixed rate mortgage. Okay. Especially on the smaller and loan amounts, there's not that
[00:10:23] big of a difference in the payment on a 15 or 20 year loan. There's usually people just forget
[00:10:29] about this. And they shouldn't. A 15 year loan is in the low fives and a 20 year loan is in the high
[00:10:36] fives. So when you talk about rates being in the sixes, there are plenty of fixed rate options in
[00:10:42] the fives, DJ. And then on the other end of the spectrum, when you're in these larger loan amounts,
[00:10:48] you can look at the jumbo adjustable rate mortgages that are easily in the fives as well.
[00:10:54] So clients that are borrowing in most cities and states over 726,000, they're going to do
[00:11:00] themselves a favor by shopping this around. They don't need 30 years at these rates.
[00:11:06] The flavors come in five, seven, and ten years. And if you lock a rate for the next seven years,
[00:11:12] I'm fairly certain that we're going to see rates lower in the next seven years than what we have
[00:11:17] today. So why take a fixed rate mortgage as long as you can sleep well at night? You can take a
[00:11:23] rate in the sixes or you can take a rate down into the fives and just work with a bank that will
[00:11:28] promise to do a free refinance for you. And there's plenty of banks out there. So make sure you're
[00:11:33] partnering with those people. Whether it's me or not, there's so many banks currently that no
[00:11:39] matter what, they'll do a no cost refinance for your clients. And that could get them over the
[00:11:44] home too if they're afraid to buy now. So some good strategies there in terms of rates.
[00:11:50] Yeah, that makes a lot of sense. Are you seeing any hesitation that buyers had last year as
[00:11:59] rates were steadily increasing? We're seeing that level off now. Are you seeing the attitudes of
[00:12:05] buyers changing? Well, they're still very price conscious, right? It literally is hundreds of
[00:12:11] dollars more per month, DJ. So we still do really want to dig in and make sure the clients come from
[00:12:16] with the monthly payment because there are a lot of people that because of this rate increase,
[00:12:21] probably should it buy. And they don't hear that. They just continue to be told, oh, everything is fine.
[00:12:27] Let's get you into a home. And that's not the best way to build a business. That's a great way to
[00:12:32] be a salesperson. But there's a lot of people that probably should not buy until rates do come down
[00:12:38] and just working through and finding out what somebody's come from ability is is a lot more important
[00:12:43] than whether they qualify it. A lot of banks will lend them money. But if it's hundreds of dollars
[00:12:49] more than they're comfortable with and you know that as an agent, you can set the expectation as
[00:12:55] to what they can go out and look at it because the pricing is a lot different today than it was
[00:12:59] before. If they were only approved before at a $250,000 or a $350,000 place, now that rates are
[00:13:07] higher, that approval amounts come down a lot. So it's important to be working with them and understand
[00:13:12] what their qualifications are and really where their comfort level is.
[00:13:17] What would you sell a homeowner's right now that are thinking that they maybe they'll sell
[00:13:27] but they're worried about inventory, right? So they sell their property, they might be worried.
[00:13:32] I don't know if there's enough inventory out there to buy something else. What would you say to them?
[00:13:37] I'll tell them they could come live with you until they find a place. And that's the most thing.
[00:13:40] Let's get the home sold and DJ will put you up. I'll put you up myself.
[00:13:44] Now it is a problem. It is part of most conversations that I have and when I always recommend
[00:13:52] people do is make sure they know what they can buy before they list their home because it's
[00:13:58] going to be a lot quicker of a sale right now. You're going to sell your home a lot faster than
[00:14:03] you're probably going to find the home that you like in this market, right? Yeah.
[00:14:08] So yeah, with that said though, just a little further on that conversation is that if you know
[00:14:14] what you're going to sell it for, you don't have to have it listed. You can go out and shop for
[00:14:19] the properties that you're getting ready to buy. And as soon as you do go under contract in that
[00:14:24] place, be ready with your agent to have the place listed because if you're in most markets,
[00:14:29] these are quick sales. And so there is a strategy to finding the home first that you want to buy
[00:14:36] as long as you have the photos taken of your home, you can delay that putting it on the market
[00:14:41] so that it tides out perfectly. I'd love to talk also about some of the more creative
[00:14:48] products that lending institutions are offering that are popular these days.
[00:14:54] Buy downs. I know we've touched on these before. I don't think we can talk about this enough
[00:14:59] because I don't hear agents because I do speak to a lot of agents, not just through the show,
[00:15:06] but even just out in my own personal life. And I mentioned the buy down thing and I swear half
[00:15:12] of the agents I talk to go, what's that? So I want to educate everybody about these buy down options
[00:15:17] because I think this is such a cool way to mitigate some of the interest rate environment. We're in.
[00:15:24] So let's cut through all the data and actually get down to the numbers and actually understand
[00:15:30] what it means. So if developers are giving the money to the buyer or the seller is giving the
[00:15:39] money to the buyer, this works. But if you're just increasing the purchase price to cover the cost
[00:15:46] of the buy down, I'm not a proponent of that. So let's do a strategy right now, our little quick
[00:15:51] breakdown of a $500,000 purchase. The client's going to put 20% down and then I'm going to give you
[00:15:58] a pop quiz on the savings because this is fun. I'm going to put you on the spot here because if you
[00:16:04] have a $500,000 home and we would be doing a $400,000 loan, we're going to ask the seller for a 3%
[00:16:13] credit and that 3% closing cost credit, DJ will fund a $21 rate buy down and that $21 rate buy
[00:16:22] down drives the rate down to full percentage points in the first year, 1.2 year and then the
[00:16:31] borrower pays the note rate in the final 28 years. So buyers will say, well why don't I just take
[00:16:39] $15 brand off the price? Okay, if the seller was going to give me $15 brand, I just want to pay $15
[00:16:45] brand less for the home. Sure. And so I run that calculation and I say that that will save on a
[00:16:52] monthly basis $92 a month, which is good. So now the pop quiz comes in and if you're doing it on a
[00:17:00] 2-1 buy down DJ, do you think it doubles the monthly savings? Do you think it's a little bit
[00:17:06] less than double or do you think it's more than double? I would say it's more than. Yes,
[00:17:16] it's more than but it's a lot more than. So if you actually take this, it saves $496 a month
[00:17:24] in the first year. It saves $254 a month in the next year and that's where the problem is,
[00:17:31] it's the first two years. We really feel that the fed is going to get the center of control
[00:17:35] and rates will be lower. If we're wrong, the sellers have still funded the buy down, so that's
[00:17:41] a great strategy and it does save a lot of money. Now, the big thing here is that the buyer still
[00:17:47] has to qualify on the higher payment. Sure. It's not an excuse to get into a home that's over your
[00:17:53] adlitism settlement. We don't want buyers having to have this 2-1 buy down to qualify.
[00:18:01] But it's a really nice bonus when the seller or we can negotiate if it's not even a developed
[00:18:08] purchase of individual selling the home to fund a 2-1 buy down. It's 3% of the purchase price
[00:18:15] and then it takes 2% off year one and 1% the next year. That's great. And then I know that there's
[00:18:22] the you were mentioning before we got on air another strategy about parents who have children
[00:18:28] that are going off to college. Now, I will tell you what you're about to mention. My I dated a
[00:18:34] woman many, many, many years ago whose family did exactly this and it was a great investment for them.
[00:18:40] It worked out really well. Save them a lot of money over the years. But let's talk about that.
[00:18:45] What's called the family opportunity loan and most banks that you're already working with if
[00:18:50] you're a REALTOR. They do have this even if they don't know it. And what it allows people to do is
[00:18:55] it's twofold. The first one is mom and dad buying a home or a condominium for a college-bound
[00:19:03] student. It could be enrolled right now or enrolling in the next semester and they're allowed to buy
[00:19:10] that property even though the client is not living in it. The son or daughter is not going to go
[00:19:18] on the mortgage and you're allowed to do that with just a 5% down payment. What that means is we're
[00:19:24] essentially buying an investment property because in a year or two the son or daughter probably won't
[00:19:30] continue to stay in that property. And so now we've created a situation where we've bought a home
[00:19:37] with only 5% down and you're fully and legally allowed to rent it even after 12 months.
[00:19:44] Yeah, it's a great opportunity to have your child live rent free, collect the rent from the
[00:19:51] other tenants and then continue to rent out the property as the child moves on. I know I switched
[00:19:57] places I lived every year in college as well. But this isn't, you know, these are where a lot of
[00:20:03] people can save money on the room and board. So this is a great opportunity to invest a little bit
[00:20:10] and collect all of the tax deductions which is nice about having income producing properties as
[00:20:16] well. So this would be another really great opportunity to talk to anyone that you know that has
[00:20:23] children that are nearing the end of their high school years or maybe their first couple of years
[00:20:29] of even college. This is when you know you could start saying, hey, is anyone ever talked to you instead
[00:20:34] of you know just paying for rent for you know your children at school that maybe this is another
[00:20:40] option. This would be a great reason to reach out and just have that conversation with everyone
[00:20:44] who has a child in high school you know getting to the end of going off to college.
[00:20:50] DJ, can you imagine how much money you or I would have if our parents instead of paying for the
[00:20:55] room and board at college, bought a place and literally just kept that place and that's the
[00:21:01] point right now. Amazing. A lot of people, you're not doing this for the 18-year-old that's moving to
[00:21:07] college for the very first time. It's usually the move up, they've been in college for a year or two
[00:21:12] and maybe they're a junior or a senior and the other thing that I did not mention is that
[00:21:17] you are allowed to collect rents so a lot of my clients have their daughter and then they have two or
[00:21:23] three roommates and they're fully allowed to collect rents from the bedrooms that are there
[00:21:28] as long as the parents qualify that's not a rental property and it really allows for
[00:21:35] generational wealth. You're buying something and you're not putting money into the room and board.
[00:21:40] Now the other side of that which unfortunately we see is a lot of times we have maybe
[00:21:46] a client whose mother or father unfortunately passes away and now mom or dad needs to downsized
[00:21:55] and mom or dad is elderly, isn't working and the parents are making the choice, you know, you're
[00:22:01] trying to get a point now where you become your parents parent and you have to figure out am I going
[00:22:06] to pay for at least for my mother for the next couple of years or gosh if I'm paying two or $3,000
[00:22:15] a month I'd like to buy something for her and I can afford the payment but I don't want to put
[00:22:21] $100,000 down so that's the strategy again you can just put 5% down and have mom or dad living in
[00:22:29] the property and it's completely different DJ than it being a second home or an investment property.
[00:22:35] These are priced as another primary residence and it's the only time that I know of that any
[00:22:43] underwriter allows you to have a second primary residence and that means the rates are a lot lower,
[00:22:49] the mortgage insurance is next to nothing and it can count for 5% down so there's some strategies
[00:22:55] there again it's called the Family Opportunity Loan, I take it as an opportunity if I was an agent
[00:23:00] to reach out to the lenders that I'm working with right now and say as listen to a podcast do you
[00:23:06] have this loan program and the good ones that you're working with know all about it.
[00:23:10] So the Family Opportunity Loan allows an individual to possibly purchase another property for someone
[00:23:19] in the family it becomes another primary residence you're allowed to collect, obviously there's
[00:23:26] qualifications and you need to fit into this very specific bucket here but you're allowed to collect
[00:23:33] rent but it's not considered a rental property. No you have to have the parent in that property or
[00:23:39] the son or daughter in the property. What we can't do is call it this and literally just have it
[00:23:44] be an investment property so that goes against the nature of it and so it does allow for somebody to
[00:23:49] move in you could collect rents if there were bedrooms for sure and then after one year the son or
[00:23:56] daughter moves out or mom or dad moves to another location you're fully within your rights to have
[00:24:03] that be an investment property as long as for the first 12 months it was occupied by the person that
[00:24:08] was on the front paper. That's an amazing strategy so you live in the property for a year that's
[00:24:15] cemented as a residence and then from there on out you can kind of do what you want with only
[00:24:21] and only starting the whole thing with only 5% out that is an incredible option. Guys these are the
[00:24:28] kind of creative ways that for lending and for real estate transactions that has really taken
[00:24:36] Joel from start to where he is now at the very top of the lending food chain because he is
[00:24:44] always thinking about creative solutions for his clients. That's incredible. You kind of blew my
[00:24:51] mind with that. I did not know that was an option so I'm really a little bit more. There's one more
[00:24:55] thing about this though, right? DJ because I know right now people are thinking in their mind.
[00:25:00] Well if I put 20% down on that I don't have to pay mortgage insurance. Okay so let me tell you
[00:25:06] about why this program is amazing. Is it with 5% down and if we consider the primary residence
[00:25:13] let's take a $400,000 property. Yes you could put 80 grand down and not have mortgage insurance
[00:25:20] but I had a client recently just do the 5% down where they put down $20,000 and that mortgage
[00:25:27] insurance was about $51 a month. So $51 and yes that money is going right out the window. I'll be the
[00:25:35] first to admit it. We don't ever want to pay mortgage insurance but the decision was if I'm only
[00:25:42] putting 20 grand down instead of 80 grand and I'm getting the exact same rate I don't want to put
[00:25:49] down 80 grand if it only cost me $51 extra and that's the solution. And if I'm an agent now I know
[00:25:55] two strategies and I'm keeping my antennas up. I'm thinking of people that are getting older and
[00:26:01] thinking maybe they have a parent that needs this. It doesn't need to be somebody who passes away.
[00:26:06] It just needs to be a situation where you want to put mom or dad into a property or a son or daughter
[00:26:13] whose college bound or enrolled in a property and this is the strategy to do it without 20% down.
[00:26:20] It's amazing. Yeah that is an amazing. You really, again you're blowing my mind with those. I did
[00:26:25] not know that product existed and what a great opportunity for anyone with aging parents or
[00:26:33] who have or who are parents themselves and have kids who are in college and you're tired of paying
[00:26:39] that room and board rent. Yes. Let's let you know I also would look you know it's funny I just saw
[00:26:50] the National Association of REALTORS Lawrence Yoon the basically the head economist. He just said
[00:26:56] that he was very happy with inflation. The numbers most important are recently released and he said
[00:27:03] he believes rates are on the way down. So the very top guy at the National Association of REALTORS
[00:27:09] believes rates are are going to be coming down at some point. Didn't he say when? But we hope
[00:27:14] we hope soon but again I still think this is not a time to get discouraged. This is just a time to
[00:27:21] get work a little harder right? This not not Joel of course Joel always works hard but for everyone
[00:27:26] listening. This is the time where lots of people are sitting on the sidelines lots of agents are not
[00:27:33] moving forward. You know they're paying attention to only what's happening in the news and they're
[00:27:39] maybe they're they have a little fear. This is the time to to keep to bring these kind of options
[00:27:45] to your clients whether or not it's a right fit for them that you know you guys will figure out
[00:27:51] but this is a time to be overcommunicate versus undercommunicate. You're exactly right and when we
[00:27:57] think about what happened with inflation and what the feds historic move up in rates right maybe
[00:28:03] we see a little bit of volatility here where they go up a little bit before they come down but the
[00:28:08] likelihood that the fed does the same amount of rate increases that they've already done is next to
[00:28:14] nothing. There's a very little chance that the rates continue to go up that much okay it is much
[00:28:19] more likely that the worst of the inflation is behind us and that means at some point in time next
[00:28:25] year we're going to see rates come down and they might come up a little bit but the situation
[00:28:30] really truly is that we should stay positive. We know that rates here in the sixes aren't something
[00:28:37] that makes you want to jump out of a tree everything is okay and in the near future rates will be
[00:28:43] lower so let's go out and get all the deals we can right now and let's help all the clients we can
[00:28:48] now because when the floodgates turn on again you better be ready because when rates are now we're
[00:28:54] going to see that again in the future and we have a lot more activity so get ready for it. I started
[00:28:59] as a financial advisor on September 12 2001 which of course we know what happened the day prior
[00:29:10] but it was also aside from the terrorist attack that happened it was also the tech bubble had already
[00:29:15] started crashing significantly if we were if we were alive during those times and I will tell you
[00:29:22] that people would told me at that time this is the worst possible time to get in I was coming in
[00:29:28] when people were losing 85 90% of if they were heavily invested in tech technology at that time the
[00:29:37] turn of the millennium that people were down significantly and I was told worst time you could
[00:29:43] possibly get in it was the best time to get in actually because as a result I worked really hard
[00:29:48] I didn't know any different and as a result I just pounded through and I found people that were
[00:29:55] like me that were new to the market that you know didn't have a history behind me to say like well
[00:30:02] I made 80% last year and now I've lost it all this is a great time to pick up what I'm really talking
[00:30:08] about is first time home buyers this is a great opportunity to pick up first time home buyers when
[00:30:14] people are ready to buy they're ready to buy you know rates be damned you know quite honestly like
[00:30:19] when people need to move they need to move so now is a time to get in I would encourage all of our
[00:30:23] listeners find out where you're the people in your your contact list where they work and I would
[00:30:29] I would partner up with someone like Joel or Joel himself and I would say I want to go to visit some
[00:30:36] of these companies I want to you know bring in some lunch I want to do a whole pitch on I want to
[00:30:42] talk to people who are in their like late 20s early 30s who are thinking about buying glad that
[00:30:46] yet done it and that that's going to be my market and if you do that this year you're going to be
[00:30:52] golden right now and that's the reason if I'm an agent right now like I continue to turn in
[00:30:58] to the key of an aerial podcast you're getting information you're getting one extra thing that
[00:31:03] you can actually put in place right now and if you're in a market like we are
[00:31:09] rencerned not cheap and I don't really know a market now that I think about it where rents are cheap
[00:31:14] and if you are renting the rate that you're paying is 100 and DJI like 6.5 or 6% a lot more than
[00:31:24] I like 100% right so remember this when people complain about where the rates are and they're
[00:31:30] renting remind them that the rate that they're paying right now is 100% all of that money goes
[00:31:36] out the window and if you own a place 6% is going out the window and everything else is actually
[00:31:42] going to pay down your mortgage and you get a tax deduction so remember this guy is not falling
[00:31:49] if somebody is renting you can help them and just work your sphere there's a lot of opportunities
[00:31:55] right now and stay positive and that's my advice for you and guys what I would recommend and when
[00:32:02] I say guys I should stop saying that because obviously we actually have more female listeners than
[00:32:06] the male listeners they say girls but I'll just say everyone this is what I would do if I
[00:32:13] was if I were you and I meet with a client and they're not sure I would say you know what I've
[00:32:19] got the group the best mortgage person the best lender I'm gonna we're gonna have a conversation
[00:32:23] and they're gonna try to figure out a creative strategy for you you don't have to know everything
[00:32:28] you just have to know the right lender and when you pass that person over believe me
[00:32:35] lenders love those kind of introductions so you what you want to do is partner with somebody who
[00:32:41] is this creative somebody like Joel or just partner with Joel himself that's what I did that's
[00:32:47] what you should do but if you're not if Joel isn't you know able to help you you can find someone
[00:32:51] else but Joel for everyone else who's gonna follow me and follow you well what's what's the best
[00:32:57] way that they should get in touch with you so that they can find out about out about these creative
[00:33:02] strategies and these different options well I love to keep it in real community because I've
[00:33:08] literally had personal conversations with dozens of listeners they're shocked when I actually
[00:33:14] return the emails to them and personally talked to them and I love it I mean it's just part of who
[00:33:20] I am and it's just one of those things where if you want you can email me Joel at rate.com.
[00:33:26] joe at rat.com and remember if somebody's paying let's say $2,500 a month in rent
[00:33:35] their biggest objection isn't that the payment that they can't afford a mortgage is that they
[00:33:40] don't have the down payment and so coming up with these strategies to do 3% down or 5% down
[00:33:47] where the rates are really attractive on these first time home buyer programs that's going to
[00:33:52] make all the difference they're already paying a mortgage they're just paying somebody else's
[00:33:56] mortgage so help them get on the right track to home ownership the more people you help the more
[00:34:03] you'll help yourself and it all goes back to that givers game mentality if you can give and you
[00:34:09] teach and you educate people are gonna follow you and those people are gonna refer you more business
[00:34:13] so get out there and put the people first and teach them and help them.
[00:34:20] Agreed. Everyone out there grab while you're probably on your phone if you're if you are
[00:34:25] uh go to your email app and send an email to Joel at rate.com ask to be placed on his weekly
[00:34:32] mortgage update lending list and you will get a market update once a week and it's too much full
[00:34:40] of information where you can't like the example I gave earlier today it was very beautiful email
[00:34:46] I have to share it with you but it was I gotta see it it was so over the top so much data so much
[00:34:52] data and but but the point is is most people you know look we we want two or three pieces of
[00:34:59] information that we can lock into our brains that's what your uh what what your your weekly market

[00:35:50] but even right now where the rates are at if you're renting a home it's still much better to go out
[00:35:56] and see what we can buy as long as you have a small down payment you're gonna be in the door
[00:36:01] and some creative strategies for people who have children in in college as well as elderly

And now, onto our show. Welcome to another episode of Keeping It Real, the largest podcast made by real estate agents and for real estate agents. My name is DJ Paris. I am your guide and host through the show today. Once again, is our monthly series called Learn with a Lender with Joel Shobb, one of my favorite people in the whole planet. So you're so lucky to get to listen to Joel because I am lucky to get to listen to Joel. He's from Guaranteed Rate. Let's talk about Joel. Joel is the vice president of lending a Guaranteed Rate. He's been doing loans at a high level since 2003. He's got to that level because of what he does specifically for agents, which is he gives back part of his commission to the buyer on every transaction. Last year alone, Joel gave back over $300,000 in closing costs to his buyers who worked with them. And that put his volume in the top one 10th of one percent of all lenders nationwide. By the way, if you're watching this, you're probably listening. But Joel's lovely wife, Christine just walked back and forth. And I feel sad that I was talking because I would have loved to have said, high Christine, we love you. Everybody loves you. But anyway, back to Joel. And let's see, where were we? Oh, Joel is in the top one 10th of one percent of all lenders nationwide. In fact, out of 400,000 loan officers in the country, Joel is in ranked number 137. Last year, he closed 319 transactions. That was 2022. His highest amount every crushed it. He's doing well this year as well. He's just constantly doing it. Joel is a legend here in the Chicago land area. But guaranteed rate is license in all 50 states. So if you, meaning our listeners are watching, viewing, watching, listening rather, are wanting a better relationship with a lender. Somebody that can actually help you grow your business. Joel's job and his team are the kings of that. They want to talk to you. And even if you're not going to work with them directly, they have an amazing email list that we're going to get you to subscribe to because it'll give you some talking points you can use with your clients. But if you are looking for a loan officer, we cannot highly recommend Joel. He's the very best we've ever worked with. He did my mortgage. I've sent people to him. He's the very best out there. No full stop. Joel can be reached. Reach out to him at his email, Joel at rate.com, Joel at rate.com. Or you can shoot him a text message or call him at 773 6542049. Let's say hello to the biggest cubs fan. I know Joel. Job. Joel, welcome. DJ, thanks so much for having me on. I love it when we go through the numbers. But I really like being here and giving back. And this is what we were talking about. Before we got on the air, it's being able to educate and learn just one or two more things that'll help agents close another deal or help a fire or maybe even get another seller. So I'm excited. I want to start, but we always put the plugs at the end. I want to put the plug at the beginning this time because speaking of giving back you and your team put out, Joel, this is so funny. I have to actually interrupting my own story because I started to send this to you earlier this morning in an email. I got an email from a very, very famous, like a famous mortgage lender, kind of a celebrity mortgage lender on the East Coast. I won't mention his name. He's apparently a very nice person. Somehow I got on his email list. He sent me the longest email full. I mean, it was just chock full of stuff. And I looked at it in my mind. Sort of I went dizzy. And it was just so much content in one email that I literally was like, I don't know what to do with this. And I was going to send it to you because I was thinking, I'm so glad you don't do that. But you do have an email that you send out every week that your team sends out that literally gives you several different data points of what's going on in the mortgage world and the lending world. And so I want everybody who's listening to our show to subscribe to that because I've seen what other lenders send. And it's not that good. But what you send is awesome. So where can people go to subscribe to that? On DJ we call that information overload, right? There's just too much information out there. And talking to them about interest rates. And it's it's all lagging data, right? They literally are being told one week. Vorgas rates went up and they're actually lower than they were the pre-rate. And so having some bite-sized education pieces that you can look at weekly, make all the difference in the world if you're an agent. And we've created that list. So you can literally subscribe by just sending an email to Joel at rate.com and say, sign me up for your newsletter. And on a weekly basis we give you digestible DJ. Things that you can speak to in terms of not just the rates, but different programs and trends that are happening so that you can see on top of the market and do it in a way that sets you apart from others in your market. Awesome. Well, everyone go send that email to Joel at rate.com and they will get you on their email list. And then you, when you're talking to your clients and they ask what's going on in the lending world, you will have bullet points and you will not have to, oh, I have to send you this email. There was like 70 videos in the email. Anyway, tons and tons of stuff. It's information overload, but that is not what we do on this show. We distill down to the most important details because REALTORS and lending are intricately related and connected and one depends on the other. And we all need more business. So what's going on? What should we be talking about this month? Well, we got an action-packed show because right now there's so much volatility in terms of interest rates. And so it's really important if you're an agent to kind of be on top of what's going on in the market because buyers are asking, right? Should I wait right now with rates being too high? If you're an agent listening to this, I know you've heard that. A buyer says, I think I'm going to wait until rates come down before we buy. And DJ, the problem with that is when rates do come down, we're going to see a flood of buyers back into the market. And we already know that the data points for the Fed are indicating that we're going to drop rates over 100 basis points next year. So you're hearing it first that Fed probably has gone too far already, but they have to stay on track at least this year with the rate increases. And as soon as it's done, we will see a big drop. That doesn't mean that clients need to wait until that day to get into the market, even though we don't really like this phrase of buy the home, right? Where you're getting in, and I don't even like this, but it's married the home and date three. Okay. However, you can literally use this exact same strategy, whether rates are going to drop in six months or two years. We shouldn't be buying just specifically because of rate. And you know that. Yeah, it's, you know, it's so amazing. So we were looking at our numbers at our brokerage today. We have over 700 agents and this, this peel back, the curtain a little bit. We were looking at our numbers and we saw something that kind of stuck out at us. And it was really, really interesting. And so last week with our agents, we only had nine new listings, which was very, very low for us. We're like, oh, wow, that's really low. This, or I'm sorry, two weeks ago, nine, nine listings. Last week, 21 new listings. And we looked and were like, what's going on? Is it the spring market? Is it, it's, it's a lot of things, right? And the good news is, it's a great time to list your property because yes, there's, there's a little bit more competition. But rates are not, again, I just, I don't think six and a half percent or six even even higher than six percent is something to cry about. I just don't think it is. I think we need to readjust. We need to reeducate our, our, our buyers and say, hey, this is where it is. And there isn't a whole lot of inventory. It's starting to ramp up a little bit. But I still think, I, I still think rates are fine. And there's a lot of ways to get rates that are lower. Okay. So let's just have a conversation here. Buyers aren't shocked anymore. Their rates are in the low sixes. That's absolutely one of the things that I'm hearing more and more is, yeah, I expected that. This is news unlike last year where it was every single week. It continued to go up and it was a shock to people. Now it's kind of the norm, but there's a lot of ways right now to get rates that are lower than six percent. So if you're an agent, you want to have your clients look at two things. It's not just a 30 year fixed rate mortgage. Okay. Especially on the smaller and loan amounts, there's not that big of a difference in the payment on a 15 or 20 year loan. There's usually people just forget about this. And they shouldn't. A 15 year loan is in the low fives and a 20 year loan is in the high fives. So when you talk about rates being in the sixes, there are plenty of fixed rate options in the fives, DJ. And then on the other end of the spectrum, when you're in these larger loan amounts, you can look at the jumbo adjustable rate mortgages that are easily in the fives as well. So clients that are borrowing in most cities and states over 726,000, they're going to do themselves a favor by shopping this around. They don't need 30 years at these rates. The flavors come in five, seven, and ten years. And if you lock a rate for the next seven years, I'm fairly certain that we're going to see rates lower in the next seven years than what we have today. So why take a fixed rate mortgage as long as you can sleep well at night? You can take a rate in the sixes or you can take a rate down into the fives and just work with a bank that will promise to do a free refinance for you. And there's plenty of banks out there. So make sure you're partnering with those people. Whether it's me or not, there's so many banks currently that no matter what, they'll do a no cost refinance for your clients. And that could get them over the home too if they're afraid to buy now. So some good strategies there in terms of rates. Yeah, that makes a lot of sense. Are you seeing any hesitation that buyers had last year as rates were steadily increasing? We're seeing that level off now. Are you seeing the attitudes of buyers changing? Well, they're still very price conscious, right? It literally is hundreds of dollars more per month, DJ. So we still do really want to dig in and make sure the clients come from with the monthly payment because there are a lot of people that because of this rate increase, probably should it buy. And they don't hear that. They just continue to be told, oh, everything is fine. Let's get you into a home. And that's not the best way to build a business. That's a great way to be a salesperson. But there's a lot of people that probably should not buy until rates do come down and just working through and finding out what somebody's come from ability is is a lot more important than whether they qualify it. A lot of banks will lend them money. But if it's hundreds of dollars more than they're comfortable with and you know that as an agent, you can set the expectation as to what they can go out and look at it because the pricing is a lot different today than it was before. If they were only approved before at a $250,000 or a $350,000 place, now that rates are higher, that approval amounts come down a lot. So it's important to be working with them and understand what their qualifications are and really where their comfort level is. What would you sell a homeowner's right now that are thinking that they maybe they'll sell but they're worried about inventory, right? So they sell their property, they might be worried. I don't know if there's enough inventory out there to buy something else. What would you say to them? I'll tell them they could come live with you until they find a place. And that's the most thing. Let's get the home sold and DJ will put you up. I'll put you up myself. Now it is a problem. It is part of most conversations that I have and when I always recommend people do is make sure they know what they can buy before they list their home because it's going to be a lot quicker of a sale right now. You're going to sell your home a lot faster than you're probably going to find the home that you like in this market, right? Yeah. So yeah, with that said though, just a little further on that conversation is that if you know what you're going to sell it for, you don't have to have it listed. You can go out and shop for the properties that you're getting ready to buy. And as soon as you do go under contract in that place, be ready with your agent to have the place listed because if you're in most markets, these are quick sales. And so there is a strategy to finding the home first that you want to buy as long as you have the photos taken of your home, you can delay that putting it on the market so that it tides out perfectly. I'd love to talk also about some of the more creative products that lending institutions are offering that are popular these days. Buy downs. I know we've touched on these before. I don't think we can talk about this enough because I don't hear agents because I do speak to a lot of agents, not just through the show, but even just out in my own personal life. And I mentioned the buy down thing and I swear half of the agents I talk to go, what's that? So I want to educate everybody about these buy down options because I think this is such a cool way to mitigate some of the interest rate environment. We're in. So let's cut through all the data and actually get down to the numbers and actually understand what it means. So if developers are giving the money to the buyer or the seller is giving the money to the buyer, this works. But if you're just increasing the purchase price to cover the cost of the buy down, I'm not a proponent of that. So let's do a strategy right now, our little quick breakdown of a $500,000 purchase. The client's going to put 20% down and then I'm going to give you a pop quiz on the savings because this is fun. I'm going to put you on the spot here because if you have a $500,000 home and we would be doing a $400,000 loan, we're going to ask the seller for a 3% credit and that 3% closing cost credit, DJ will fund a $21 rate buy down and that $21 rate buy down drives the rate down to full percentage points in the first year, 1.2 year and then the borrower pays the note rate in the final 28 years. So buyers will say, well why don't I just take $15 brand off the price? Okay, if the seller was going to give me $15 brand, I just want to pay $15 brand less for the home. Sure. And so I run that calculation and I say that that will save on a monthly basis $92 a month, which is good. So now the pop quiz comes in and if you're doing it on a 2-1 buy down DJ, do you think it doubles the monthly savings? Do you think it's a little bit less than double or do you think it's more than double? I would say it's more than. Yes, it's more than but it's a lot more than. So if you actually take this, it saves $496 a month in the first year. It saves $254 a month in the next year and that's where the problem is, it's the first two years. We really feel that the fed is going to get the center of control and rates will be lower. If we're wrong, the sellers have still funded the buy down, so that's a great strategy and it does save a lot of money. Now, the big thing here is that the buyer still has to qualify on the higher payment. Sure. It's not an excuse to get into a home that's over your adlitism settlement. We don't want buyers having to have this 2-1 buy down to qualify. But it's a really nice bonus when the seller or we can negotiate if it's not even a developed purchase of individual selling the home to fund a 2-1 buy down. It's 3% of the purchase price and then it takes 2% off year one and 1% the next year. That's great. And then I know that there's the you were mentioning before we got on air another strategy about parents who have children that are going off to college. Now, I will tell you what you're about to mention. My I dated a woman many, many, many years ago whose family did exactly this and it was a great investment for them. It worked out really well. Save them a lot of money over the years. But let's talk about that. What's called the family opportunity loan and most banks that you're already working with if you're a REALTOR. They do have this even if they don't know it. And what it allows people to do is it's twofold. The first one is mom and dad buying a home or a condominium for a college-bound student. It could be enrolled right now or enrolling in the next semester and they're allowed to buy that property even though the client is not living in it. The son or daughter is not going to go on the mortgage and you're allowed to do that with just a 5% down payment. What that means is we're essentially buying an investment property because in a year or two the son or daughter probably won't continue to stay in that property. And so now we've created a situation where we've bought a home with only 5% down and you're fully and legally allowed to rent it even after 12 months. Yeah, it's a great opportunity to have your child live rent free, collect the rent from the other tenants and then continue to rent out the property as the child moves on. I know I switched places I lived every year in college as well. But this isn't, you know, these are where a lot of people can save money on the room and board. So this is a great opportunity to invest a little bit and collect all of the tax deductions which is nice about having income producing properties as well. So this would be another really great opportunity to talk to anyone that you know that has children that are nearing the end of their high school years or maybe their first couple of years of even college. This is when you know you could start saying, hey, is anyone ever talked to you instead of you know just paying for rent for you know your children at school that maybe this is another option. This would be a great reason to reach out and just have that conversation with everyone who has a child in high school you know getting to the end of going off to college. DJ, can you imagine how much money you or I would have if our parents instead of paying for the room and board at college, bought a place and literally just kept that place and that's the point right now. Amazing. A lot of people, you're not doing this for the 18-year-old that's moving to college for the very first time. It's usually the move up, they've been in college for a year or two and maybe they're a junior or a senior and the other thing that I did not mention is that you are allowed to collect rents so a lot of my clients have their daughter and then they have two or three roommates and they're fully allowed to collect rents from the bedrooms that are there as long as the parents qualify that's not a rental property and it really allows for generational wealth. You're buying something and you're not putting money into the room and board. Now the other side of that which unfortunately we see is a lot of times we have maybe a client whose mother or father unfortunately passes away and now mom or dad needs to downsized and mom or dad is elderly, isn't working and the parents are making the choice, you know, you're trying to get a point now where you become your parents parent and you have to figure out am I going to pay for at least for my mother for the next couple of years or gosh if I'm paying two or $3,000 a month I'd like to buy something for her and I can afford the payment but I don't want to put $100,000 down so that's the strategy again you can just put 5% down and have mom or dad living in the property and it's completely different DJ than it being a second home or an investment property. These are priced as another primary residence and it's the only time that I know of that any underwriter allows you to have a second primary residence and that means the rates are a lot lower, the mortgage insurance is next to nothing and it can count for 5% down so there's some strategies there again it's called the Family Opportunity Loan, I take it as an opportunity if I was an agent to reach out to the lenders that I'm working with right now and say as listen to a podcast do you have this loan program and the good ones that you're working with know all about it. So the Family Opportunity Loan allows an individual to possibly purchase another property for someone in the family it becomes another primary residence you're allowed to collect, obviously there's qualifications and you need to fit into this very specific bucket here but you're allowed to collect rent but it's not considered a rental property. No you have to have the parent in that property or the son or daughter in the property. What we can't do is call it this and literally just have it be an investment property so that goes against the nature of it and so it does allow for somebody to move in you could collect rents if there were bedrooms for sure and then after one year the son or daughter moves out or mom or dad moves to another location you're fully within your rights to have that be an investment property as long as for the first 12 months it was occupied by the person that was on the front paper. That's an amazing strategy so you live in the property for a year that's cemented as a residence and then from there on out you can kind of do what you want with only and only starting the whole thing with only 5% out that is an incredible option. Guys these are the kind of creative ways that for lending and for real estate transactions that has really taken Joel from start to where he is now at the very top of the lending food chain because he is always thinking about creative solutions for his clients. That's incredible. You kind of blew my mind with that. I did not know that was an option so I'm really a little bit more. There's one more thing about this though, right? DJ because I know right now people are thinking in their mind. Well if I put 20% down on that I don't have to pay mortgage insurance. Okay so let me tell you about why this program is amazing. Is it with 5% down and if we consider the primary residence let's take a $400,000 property. Yes you could put 80 grand down and not have mortgage insurance but I had a client recently just do the 5% down where they put down $20,000 and that mortgage insurance was about $51 a month. So $51 and yes that money is going right out the window. I'll be the first to admit it. We don't ever want to pay mortgage insurance but the decision was if I'm only putting 20 grand down instead of 80 grand and I'm getting the exact same rate I don't want to put down 80 grand if it only cost me $51 extra and that's the solution. And if I'm an agent now I know two strategies and I'm keeping my antennas up. I'm thinking of people that are getting older and thinking maybe they have a parent that needs this. It doesn't need to be somebody who passes away. It just needs to be a situation where you want to put mom or dad into a property or a son or daughter whose college bound or enrolled in a property and this is the strategy to do it without 20% down. It's amazing. Yeah that is an amazing. You really, again you're blowing my mind with those. I did not know that product existed and what a great opportunity for anyone with aging parents or who have or who are parents themselves and have kids who are in college and you're tired of paying that room and board rent. Yes. Let's let you know I also would look you know it's funny I just saw the National Association of REALTORS Lawrence Yoon the basically the head economist. He just said that he was very happy with inflation. The numbers most important are recently released and he said he believes rates are on the way down. So the very top guy at the National Association of REALTORS believes rates are are going to be coming down at some point. Didn't he say when? But we hope we hope soon but again I still think this is not a time to get discouraged. This is just a time to get work a little harder right? This not not Joel of course Joel always works hard but for everyone listening. This is the time where lots of people are sitting on the sidelines lots of agents are not moving forward. You know they're paying attention to only what's happening in the news and they're maybe they're they have a little fear. This is the time to to keep to bring these kind of options to your clients whether or not it's a right fit for them that you know you guys will figure out but this is a time to be overcommunicate versus undercommunicate. You're exactly right and when we think about what happened with inflation and what the feds historic move up in rates right maybe we see a little bit of volatility here where they go up a little bit before they come down but the likelihood that the fed does the same amount of rate increases that they've already done is next to nothing. There's a very little chance that the rates continue to go up that much okay it is much more likely that the worst of the inflation is behind us and that means at some point in time next year we're going to see rates come down and they might come up a little bit but the situation really truly is that we should stay positive. We know that rates here in the sixes aren't something that makes you want to jump out of a tree everything is okay and in the near future rates will be lower so let's go out and get all the deals we can right now and let's help all the clients we can now because when the floodgates turn on again you better be ready because when rates are now we're going to see that again in the future and we have a lot more activity so get ready for it. I started as a financial advisor on September 12 2001 which of course we know what happened the day prior but it was also aside from the terrorist attack that happened it was also the tech bubble had already started crashing significantly if we were if we were alive during those times and I will tell you that people would told me at that time this is the worst possible time to get in I was coming in when people were losing 85 90% of if they were heavily invested in tech technology at that time the turn of the millennium that people were down significantly and I was told worst time you could possibly get in it was the best time to get in actually because as a result I worked really hard I didn't know any different and as a result I just pounded through and I found people that were like me that were new to the market that you know didn't have a history behind me to say like well I made 80% last year and now I've lost it all this is a great time to pick up what I'm really talking about is first time home buyers this is a great opportunity to pick up first time home buyers when people are ready to buy they're ready to buy you know rates be damned you know quite honestly like when people need to move they need to move so now is a time to get in I would encourage all of our listeners find out where you're the people in your your contact list where they work and I would I would partner up with someone like Joel or Joel himself and I would say I want to go to visit some of these companies I want to you know bring in some lunch I want to do a whole pitch on I want to talk to people who are in their like late 20s early 30s who are thinking about buying glad that yet done it and that that's going to be my market and if you do that this year you're going to be golden right now and that's the reason if I'm an agent right now like I continue to turn in to the key of an aerial podcast you're getting information you're getting one extra thing that you can actually put in place right now and if you're in a market like we are rencerned not cheap and I don't really know a market now that I think about it where rents are cheap and if you are renting the rate that you're paying is 100 and DJI like 6.5 or 6% a lot more than I like 100% right so remember this when people complain about where the rates are and they're renting remind them that the rate that they're paying right now is 100% all of that money goes out the window and if you own a place 6% is going out the window and everything else is actually going to pay down your mortgage and you get a tax deduction so remember this guy is not falling if somebody is renting you can help them and just work your sphere there's a lot of opportunities right now and stay positive and that's my advice for you and guys what I would recommend and when I say guys I should stop saying that because obviously we actually have more female listeners than the male listeners they say girls but I'll just say everyone this is what I would do if I was if I were you and I meet with a client and they're not sure I would say you know what I've got the group the best mortgage person the best lender I'm gonna we're gonna have a conversation and they're gonna try to figure out a creative strategy for you you don't have to know everything you just have to know the right lender and when you pass that person over believe me lenders love those kind of introductions so you what you want to do is partner with somebody who is this creative somebody like Joel or just partner with Joel himself that's what I did that's what you should do but if you're not if Joel isn't you know able to help you you can find someone else but Joel for everyone else who's gonna follow me and follow you well what's what's the best way that they should get in touch with you so that they can find out about out about these creative strategies and these different options well I love to keep it in real community because I've literally had personal conversations with dozens of listeners they're shocked when I actually return the emails to them and personally talked to them and I love it I mean it's just part of who I am and it's just one of those things where if you want you can email me Joel at rate.com. joe at rat.com and remember if somebody's paying let's say $2,500 a month in rent their biggest objection isn't that the payment that they can't afford a mortgage is that they don't have the down payment and so coming up with these strategies to do 3% down or 5% down where the rates are really attractive on these first time home buyer programs that's going to make all the difference they're already paying a mortgage they're just paying somebody else's mortgage so help them get on the right track to home ownership the more people you help the more you'll help yourself and it all goes back to that givers game mentality if you can give and you teach and you educate people are gonna follow you and those people are gonna refer you more business so get out there and put the people first and teach them and help them.
