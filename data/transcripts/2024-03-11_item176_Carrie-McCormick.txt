[00:03:01] Welcome to Keeping It Real, the largest podcast made by Real Estate Agents and four Real Estate
[00:03:07] Agents.
[00:03:07] My name is DJ Paris.
[00:03:08] I'm your guide and host through the show.
[00:03:10] Today is our monthly series called The Monday Market Minute with Carrie McCormick from
[00:03:15] the Carrie McCormick Real Estate Group with app properties here in Chicago.
[00:03:19] Now Carrie is not only a top 1% producer in Chicago, she's a top 0.001% producer.
[00:03:26] Over 20 years of experience helping buyers, sellers and investors.
[00:03:31] In fact, Carrie is out of 46,000 REALTORS.
[00:03:35] She is routinely in the top 10 highest producing agents in the entire Chicago and area.
[00:03:40] She is just crushing it.
[00:03:42] A true superstar and expert in everything from first time home buyers, veteran investors
[00:03:47] and luxury properties.
[00:03:49] She also works with a lot of developers and is often chosen to represent their high end
[00:03:53] developments.
[00:03:54] I actually live in one of Carrie's developments.
[00:03:57] So I'm a big fan of Carrie and I'm so grateful because not only do I have a great show because
[00:04:02] of her, I have a place to live because of her.
[00:04:04] So I am very happy to know Carrie.
[00:04:06] But please, everyone else visit Carrie at her website, Carrie McCormick, R-E.com.
[00:04:12] Most importantly, follow her on Instagram.
[00:04:15] She is the queen of Instagram and does it all herself and it's truly remarkable.
[00:04:20] We have agents at our firm who don't even know that I know Carrie who come up to me and are like,
[00:04:24] oh my god, have you ever seen Carrie McCormick's Instagram?
[00:04:27] She does incredible things with drones and just your videos are insane.
[00:04:31] So it's Carrie McCormick real estate.
[00:04:33] We'll have a link to both of those in the show notes.
[00:04:36] Please follow her.
[00:04:37] Carrie, welcome once again to the show.
[00:04:39] Thank you.
[00:04:40] That's quite the introduction and I appreciate it.
[00:04:44] I think about you a lot because when I go home, I'm like the only reason I know about this is
[00:04:48] years ago you were like, oh, I have this development coming up and I was like, I'll go support my friend
[00:04:53] and go check it out. I had no intention of buying anything.
[00:04:57] And then like six months later, I was buying it and it's like was one of the best decisions I've ever made.
[00:05:01] Oh, I'm so happy.
[00:05:03] Oh, I love it.
[00:05:04] I love it.
[00:05:04] So anyway, big fan of yours, of course.
[00:05:07] What's what do you want to talk about today?
[00:05:10] So I was going to focus on a few things.
[00:05:13] The first part I'd like to focus on is just with our sellers and our buyers with sellers
[00:05:18] getting their homes ready for the market.
[00:05:20] And then on the other side of it is what buyers are looking for when they're out.
[00:05:25] You know, obviously we're trying to match the two.
[00:05:27] So the seller's selling, buyers buying.
[00:05:30] And what do we need to do to prep everyone for the market?
[00:05:32] So that's the first half I want to talk about.
[00:05:35] And then the second half is going to be talking about other markets.
[00:05:39] So I'm in Chicago and working with other brokers in other markets.
[00:05:44] So first off, you know, over the last couple of years, I call them Instagram homes.
[00:05:49] Everyone's becoming so spoiled with looking at homes on Instagram or HTTV or whatever it is.
[00:05:56] And they want everything perfect, right?
[00:06:00] So what we've been doing with the sellers, things have been dated in homes, right?
[00:06:05] And, you know, furniture is dated.
[00:06:07] The finishes are dated.
[00:06:11] So I've been taking a little bit more time with my sellers of prepping the homes.
[00:06:16] It's a lot of work.
[00:06:17] It's a lot of hard conversations to have with sellers.
[00:06:20] You know, whether it's the paint color, it's the lighting, the furniture, you know,
[00:06:24] because it's personal to them.
[00:06:25] So, you know, curating a group of people that can come into the home and help have that conversation, right?
[00:06:34] There's a company here in Chicago.
[00:06:36] I think they might be actually nationals called Kirbyo, which has been phenomenal.
[00:06:42] That comes in and they will put a quote together for the home.
[00:06:47] A lot of success stories around this.
[00:06:49] So again, just simple painting, lighting, staging the home makes a world of a difference of time on the market.
[00:06:57] And then also, of course, their purchase price.
[00:07:01] I've had sellers that push back against this of like, no, my house looks great.
[00:07:05] You know, I'm not spending any money on it.
[00:07:08] And the house does it.
[00:07:09] Linger's on the market, right?
[00:07:11] It doesn't get the price that we want it to.
[00:07:14] So it's the hard truth that we've got to tell sellers.
[00:07:16] So I would say is put that investment in, you know, as a broker of educating the sellers of what does it mean to them?
[00:07:24] And then also show them stats, show them success stories of what's happened.
[00:07:30] It takes a few additional weeks to get all of that work done, but it's definitely worth it.
[00:07:35] So in the place I live that you represented, we have all white finishes, which is super
[00:07:42] stole modern and cool and lovely.
[00:07:45] And at some point, maybe that won't be cool anymore, right?
[00:07:48] Like 20 years from now, people will be like, why did everyone go all white?
[00:07:51] But I love it.
[00:07:51] But in 20 years, I might have to consider making adjustments if I want to sell it, because maybe that won't be in vogue.
[00:07:58] Do you ever have situations where like we think about the granite countertops of the past,
[00:08:05] which could be some funky colors?
[00:08:06] And sometimes maybe it was cool at the time, 2005, but
[00:08:10] today kind of doesn't look right.
[00:08:12] Are you ever telling the sellers, hey, we got to swap that out?
[00:08:17] Yes.
[00:08:18] Yeah.
[00:08:18] And, you know, part of my job is becoming having this great network of people.
[00:08:23] So I can call the stone person.
[00:08:26] I can call the cabinet person.
[00:08:27] I can call the carper person, whatever it is.
[00:08:31] So having an army of people ready for a phone call,
[00:08:34] but that's what I was mentioning, this company, Kerbio, because they do everything.
[00:08:38] Right.
[00:08:39] So, you know, create your network of people that are able to come into the house to do some of the work that needs to be done.
[00:08:47] Or also have alternatives, because, you know, ripping out countertops is a big deal.
[00:08:52] And it's expensive.
[00:08:54] You know, so there's a color called Uba Tuba for those that are around my age.
[00:09:00] Probably remember that granite that was such a popular granite.
[00:09:05] It's green.
[00:09:06] And it's actually kind of pretty.
[00:09:08] But, you know, even if you painted the cabinets, you paint them, you know,
[00:09:11] a white or an off white or something, it makes that Uba Tuba not look so bad anymore.
[00:09:16] So, again, you know, having examples to show people, having case studies to show people.
[00:09:23] Again, you know, I say to, you know, my sellers that are pushing back against them,
[00:09:27] like, let's just get a quote.
[00:09:29] You know, let's just let me do the letter.
[00:09:30] It's a great way to let me bring some people in.
[00:09:33] Let's see how much it is.
[00:09:36] And again, once you start bringing these other trades in, they, you know,
[00:09:41] they're trying to sell their service too.
[00:09:43] So it just, it becomes a dialogue that we have.
[00:09:46] And at the end, it's usually, all right, Kerry, you're right.
[00:09:49] Let's do it.
[00:09:49] Let's get everyone going.
[00:09:51] And we end up doing it.
[00:09:53] Again, from my side, I look at it, you know,
[00:09:56] invests two weeks in getting all these trades in there and getting all these quotes done.
[00:10:00] But really, once the work is done, the house doesn't sit on the market.
[00:10:04] Right. So it's, you're going to have to sit on it one way or the other,
[00:10:07] whether it's at the beginning or it's at the, you know, when the house is on the market.
[00:10:11] So it's better to get a better price.
[00:10:13] You're client in the long run is, is very happy because you got their home sold quickly
[00:10:17] and at a high price.
[00:10:19] So again, it's investing all that in upfront.
[00:10:22] Yeah, it's, it's so funny.
[00:10:23] If I think back to like how social media, especially Instagram works currently where we have a photo we want,
[00:10:31] or we'll talk about a video, a photo we want to share.
[00:10:34] And we click a, you know, we tap on the phone and it enhances the image and it makes it look
[00:10:38] even more perfect than maybe the shot we took.
[00:10:41] Or we take a picture of ourselves and we smooth out the wrinkles or whatever we do.
[00:10:44] You know, white and our teeth and all those things you do afterwards.
[00:10:48] And people are used to seeing that perfection now without doing any work to get to the perfection.
[00:10:54] So I think I'm wondering if, but most buyers, when they walk into a place, if they do see a countertop
[00:11:01] that maybe is not as invoked today, you know, yes, could you swap it out?
[00:11:05] Of course, and you could build that into the contract.
[00:11:07] And I think people aren't as easily understanding that it's just a matter of swapping it out,
[00:11:16] whether you're on the buy side or the sell side.
[00:11:18] But it is, I think people just kind of want perfection as opposed to, yeah.
[00:11:24] And so I'm sure you do have to have a lot of hard conversations like, hey,
[00:11:27] this really isn't the style anymore.
[00:11:30] And people are going to come in here.
[00:11:31] And even though we know that we could swap it out or they could swap it out,
[00:11:34] we don't want them to have to think about that extra step.
[00:11:37] Right. Right.
[00:11:38] Or, you know, again, renderings is a great idea too of providing, you know, everyone's so visual.
[00:11:45] And, you know, you talked about just immediate gratification.
[00:11:48] No one has time.
[00:11:49] No one has vision.
[00:11:50] So, you know, again, part of our job is to create that.
[00:11:53] But we have to be careful of not to push it on the seller because I always say,
[00:11:59] sellers, they don't want to do anything, right?
[00:12:01] Right.
[00:12:02] They want us to do all the legwork.
[00:12:03] So if you're going to, if you're going to propose these ideas, be ready to do the work,
[00:12:10] not physically, but, you know, get everybody in line and do it and perform on it.
[00:12:15] So, again, don't go in there saying, Mr. Mr. Mrs.
[00:12:19] seller, this is what you have to do.
[00:12:20] You go find your own people and let me know.
[00:12:22] Again, it's our job to curate everything and make a seamless experience for them.
[00:12:28] So, it'll make your job easy in the long run.
[00:12:32] And you're probably then managing contractors and services like Curbio and you're probably
[00:12:37] employing Curbio to do that management of the, so you don't have to worry, gosh,
[00:12:41] they didn't show up today.
[00:12:43] And now my seller's pissed because they were supposed to swap out the cabinets today and nobody showed up.
[00:12:47] Right.
[00:12:49] Or, if I have a good general contractor that you trust and that you know.
[00:12:53] And that's, you know, I've been doing this for quite some time.
[00:12:56] So, you know, I feel like I've got some incredible resources.
[00:12:59] But I'm always looking for new ones and just, you know, different things to offer my clients.
[00:13:05] And as I mentioned, our sellers are busy, so they want you to do the work.
[00:13:09] Yeah.
[00:13:10] Do you ever have issues with the seller saying, well, how much more will this
[00:13:17] make me or how much more will this sell for?
[00:13:20] Do you have data to back that up or how are you having those conversations?
[00:13:24] Yeah. And actually, that's a really great point.
[00:13:26] And I think that's very important is to have the data, right.
[00:13:29] And that's why I say like case studies, you could actually as a broker go in the market and just say,
[00:13:35] okay, here's, here's two homes that are similar to yours.
[00:13:38] This one has white cabinets, painted white.
[00:13:41] I'm just making up a story, right.
[00:13:42] And this one's priced at two million.
[00:13:44] You know, this home has cherry cabinets and uba-tuba countertops and it's priced at 1.7.
[00:13:51] So there's a 300,000 delta there.
[00:13:55] You know, let me get a quote.
[00:13:56] If the quote comes in at 150, right.
[00:14:00] Kind of an over and over.
[00:14:01] Kind of a no brainer.
[00:14:02] So again, you do have to lay it out for them and show them what the value is.
[00:14:07] And again, you have to be very careful because,
[00:14:10] you know, you have to make sure that your numbers are right.
[00:14:12] You don't want your client to spend $150,000.
[00:14:15] And they're like expecting you to get, you know, double or whatever it is.
[00:14:20] So you do have to be very careful with your data, but it's super important.
[00:14:24] What about sellers?
[00:14:26] Or sorry, so that's, we talked about what buyers want.
[00:14:29] What is it that sellers?
[00:14:30] Why, you know, is there anything else that a, for example,
[00:14:34] you know, what are sellers looking for?
[00:14:37] You mean buyers?
[00:14:39] Well, yeah, I mean, we're, so when you work with sellers,
[00:14:43] it's more about just getting the house ready.
[00:14:45] What a, what actually back to sellers for a second?
[00:14:48] What about the exterior assuming it's a single family home?
[00:14:51] What are, what are you doing?
[00:14:52] Is that first impression as they pull up?
[00:14:55] How critical is that?
[00:14:56] It still is.
[00:14:57] It always has been and it still is.
[00:14:59] So, you know, landscaping is super important because even before someone makes
[00:15:04] an appointment, they may drive by the home, right?
[00:15:07] Or photography of the home is going to be super important to have, you know, greenery.
[00:15:14] So, yeah, some absolutely telling them to make sure that they, you know,
[00:15:18] have landscaping done.
[00:15:19] If there's any paint that's chipped out there, it's the first impression.
[00:15:22] And when someone walks into a house and, you know, the front porch is all chipped up
[00:15:26] or something, it just shows them of what the interior is going to look like.
[00:15:29] So absolutely.
[00:15:32] You know, I would, let's, well, actually, let's transition because I think that's good.
[00:15:37] Basically, just making the case for improving the home so that it sells faster and for more money.
[00:15:43] I mean, it's really just that simple.
[00:15:45] But as I'm thinking about all the people you have to manage for that, that is quite a task.
[00:15:50] But it's obviously, it's what your job is.
[00:15:53] And it's probably why you're so successful as you're willing to say, I'll help you with, you know,
[00:15:57] figuring all this out.
[00:16:00] And that, did that skill take a long time to develop about what to improve,
[00:16:04] how to sort of have that conversation?
[00:16:07] You know, I imagine that probably took years to develop.
[00:16:10] It does.
[00:16:10] And I think just like in anything that we do, you know, having the right dialogue with the
[00:16:16] and every personality is very different, right?
[00:16:19] So one dialogue I have with one seller is not going to be the same as it is with another.
[00:16:25] So you really have to go to the room and find out, you know, like, oh, my grandfather built this
[00:16:32] house or whatever.
[00:16:33] So I have to be careful of saying, well, you need to do the whole thing, right?
[00:16:37] So I think just understanding people and having the right dialogue with the right people is
[00:16:45] important.
[00:16:46] And going back, though, to the exterior, one thing I also wanted to mention, I'm in Chicago.
[00:16:50] So it's the weather is not always great here.
[00:16:52] And, you know, for those who are in communities that don't have leaves on the trees right now,
[00:16:58] there's, you know, using, like, virtual staging to enhance whether some greenery or I always,
[00:17:06] I never want to falsify anything, you know, so if there's grass, great, we can make a greener.
[00:17:10] But if there's not grass, you know, we don't want to add grass.
[00:17:13] But anyways, using some additional tools like that is a great way, at least online to make the
[00:17:19] home look a little bit better.
[00:17:21] Virtual staging's gotten a lot cheaper too because of AI.
[00:17:25] And so for anyone who hasn't explored it in the last year, you'll find the pricing is way
[00:17:30] different than it used to be.
[00:17:32] And the technology's much better.
[00:17:34] No more.
[00:17:34] Are we seeing those completely crazy skies that were like, I'm trying to think of, they were so
[00:17:42] vibrant that they almost, they were almost distracting from the actual home itself.
[00:17:48] It's still years time, though.
[00:17:50] Yeah, well, it can be done at just, but again, it's just the technology's getting better to look
[00:17:54] a little bit more reasonable and realistic.
[00:17:57] Now, one thing that you're doing that I think is, I've never heard anyone, it's not that I've
[00:18:02] never heard anyone doing this. I haven't heard anyone doing this in a long time.
[00:18:05] And I think it's so cool that you're doing this.
[00:18:08] You're realizing that the pandemic really shifted how we work and people are now able to sort of
[00:18:13] work most of us, I mean, unless we're real estate agents, we can kind of work wherever.
[00:18:17] And so the idea is that people are moving, you know, to different areas.
[00:18:22] And so Kerry, of course, has people coming and going.
[00:18:25] And she needs to make great relationships with agents in other markets so that they can pass,
[00:18:31] you know, business back and forth.
[00:18:33] And she knows that if she's going to pass somebody, for example, with a $2 million
[00:18:37] client, Kerry, of course, wants to make sure that her support system, her other agents in other
[00:18:44] markets, of course, are going to do good jobs.
[00:18:45] You're actually going out and visiting these agents.
[00:18:47] So tell us a little bit about that.
[00:18:49] Yeah, so, I mean, you're right.
[00:18:51] I mean, during the pandemic, everyone was moving around and I was a little bit late to the game
[00:18:56] because I was so focused on our market here, which was great.
[00:19:00] But as my clients are moving all over and you know, they're asking for referrals.
[00:19:07] And I am referring them out, but I'm like, I've never met that agent.
[00:19:11] You know, like I've talked to them on the phone or, you know, we've done a Zoom or something,
[00:19:15] but I've really never sat down and met with them.
[00:19:20] And so what I started to do just as you had mentioned is fly out to what I call our key
[00:19:26] feeder states. So a lot of people in Chicago moved to Arizona. They moved to Florida.
[00:19:32] They moved to Tennessee. They moved to Colorado.
[00:19:36] So I found a few agents out there and I go meet with them face to face.
[00:19:42] Right? I mean, there's nothing better than sitting down with somebody and
[00:19:46] having lunch with them or dinner and talking about their business and them getting to know you
[00:19:51] and more importantly, me getting to know them. What other benefit from that is is
[00:19:56] understanding their markets. Right? So I love to take a tour.
[00:20:00] I was just used like Palm Beach as an example. You know, take a tour in their communities.
[00:20:07] You know, what are they selling? What does the housing inventory look like there?
[00:20:11] What do they do for marketing? You know, how do they sell a home?
[00:20:15] So I've gone on listing net listing appointments. I've gone on showings with them.
[00:20:19] So it's just interesting to hear again, they're not my competition because they're in a different
[00:20:23] market. But you know, how do they do with a client? You know, so it's you're never not
[00:20:30] learning, right? So it's been a... You probably get to see other people's, you know, the way they
[00:20:36] do presentations. And it probably also gives you tips even though, you know, you have a great
[00:20:42] style of your own, but you probably do learn things from some of these other top agents and other
[00:20:46] areas. Like I we've had people on the show who sell 20, 30, 40 million dollar homes.
[00:20:53] And I would love to just be a fly on the wall of what it's like when that team of for the buyer
[00:20:59] pulls in and it's seven people and they got to like sort of manage all seven of these ex people
[00:21:05] and make sure all seven of them are like, this is a great home to buy. And I've talked to those
[00:21:09] agents and they're like, that is a whole skill and in of itself, I'm sure you've dealt with that as
[00:21:13] well, where you've had multiple people that are involved in the transaction on your side.
[00:21:19] So but it must be exciting to see other agents and other markets do that. Have you ever thought about
[00:21:24] possibly even serving another market? I know you're too busy to even consider that, but no,
[00:21:30] she's shaking her head. No, she is too busy. I made the mistake of asking Carrie when I got on
[00:21:35] here because it's we're actually recording this on a Friday. I'm like, what are you doing this weekend
[00:21:38] that she just like looked at me like, what are you getting? I was like, oh, that's right. You're
[00:21:43] gonna be so weird. It's a weekend. I don't even know what it is. No, but it is it's it's been
[00:21:48] it's been so great to again meet these brokers in other markets and you know, for those who
[00:21:53] don't want to travel outside of the market or don't have time to travel outside of the market.
[00:21:59] Again, even picking up the phone and having a zoo or a call with them, a zoom with them, it's
[00:22:05] you know, it's you're investing in your business by having the this incredible network.
[00:22:11] Even like again, an example is an agent in Arizona gave me a referral. She said, my client
[00:22:18] lives in Arizona. They have a place in Illinois or in Chicago and they want to sell it and you
[00:22:24] know, I'd like to refer you. I said, okay, great. I went to the home to go look at it and they didn't
[00:22:28] they don't live here anymore. So they relocated to Arizona. So what I did is so like, okay, great. We
[00:22:34] love it. Love your presentation. Send us the paperwork and I said, you know what? I'm going to fly.
[00:22:40] I'm going to come meet you. I'm going to so I flew from Chicago to Arizona to meet the seller
[00:22:46] to sign the listing paperwork in person. And I mean, it was a big listing number one.
[00:22:54] But number two, you have no idea how thankful that seller was because I didn't have to go out there.
[00:23:00] I had the business, right? The docuSign works just fine. But I thought I knew that this seller was
[00:23:06] extremely connected. I knew the broker was I don't say taking a chance at me, but the broker hadn't
[00:23:11] met me. So it was I did it two for one. I got to sit down and have dinner with the broker and
[00:23:17] meet that seller in their own home. So it was just, again, it's doing these little things in your
[00:23:24] business that are going to make such a big difference. Yeah. And most agents who are making
[00:23:29] connections in other markets with agents for referral purposes are not traveling to those other
[00:23:34] markets to meet. And you're right. They probably get calls all day long from agents all over the
[00:23:40] country saying, I, you know, let's let's connect. But when you meet them in person, obviously,
[00:23:45] that connection just gets a lot deeper a lot quicker. So that's a great tip. You know, I think that's
[00:23:50] a great place to wrap up. So I maybe everyone who's listening can think of one feeder market that
[00:23:56] your either people come or go to in your local area. Where are they moving to? And consider,
[00:24:03] you know, taking a trip down there, you know, and you know, you know, build it into your budget. Go
[00:24:09] down there and say, Hey, I really want to build a strong relationship. I'm willing to come down
[00:24:12] here and meet you and hang out with you and see if we'd be a good fit. And then you can meet like
[00:24:16] probably five, you could probably meet 10 agents in a couple of days and really get a sense of who's
[00:24:21] who's the best fit. And you know, that's what we should do for anything, right? Like most,
[00:24:25] most buyers and sellers choose the first REALTOR they, they, they meet. So we know that, you know,
[00:24:31] it's probably a good idea to get a few, I get a few offers when you're, you know, meeting
[00:24:35] with doctors or attorneys or lawyers, you know, so this is an opportunity for you to not just look
[00:24:40] at Zillow and say, who's the biggest agent in that area? But actually go, Hey, I want to come meet you
[00:24:44] and spend a few hundred dollars to do it. I want everybody to follow Carrie on insta, first of all,
[00:24:51] before we get to that, if you are somebody who has clients that move into the Chicago land area
[00:24:58] and you want to have them work with somebody who is considered a legend. And when I say that,
[00:25:03] Carrie sort of wins is because she doesn't like to think of herself that way, but everyone else
[00:25:07] see her things over that way. So I'm going to call her a legend. If you want to have your clients
[00:25:11] work with a legend, Carrie's the right person. So please consider reaching out to her and developing
[00:25:15] a relationship directly with her and perhaps you guys can do some business back and forth. So
[00:25:21] what's the best way that if anyone wants to work with you that they should reach out?
[00:25:25] Yeah. So I was, I'm a big phone person. So call me at 312-9614-612 or send me an email
[00:25:33] at Carrie, C-A-R-R-R-I-E at atproperties.com.
[00:25:39] Awesome. And also follow her on Instagram. I am not kidding when I say her Instagram is the best
[00:25:44] I've seen. Although I will tell you Carrie, there is somebody who is right on your heels. It's a
[00:25:49] total for a totally different reason. I can't remember the person's name, but he is a guy in New York
[00:25:54] or Long Island. I don't know if you've seen this guy yet. He is hysterically, he's like straight
[00:25:58] off of like casting for the sopranos and he plays that part and it's hilarious.
[00:26:04] Oh, I got to find out who that is. Oh, I'm going to send it. I'll talk about it on a future
[00:26:09] episode that everybody can watch it. Oh my god, he's he's just, it doesn't mean to be funny. He just
[00:26:13] is that guy. And you figure like maybe he just waxed somebody and that was selling homes. But
[00:26:19] it's, but Carrie's, Carrie's is actually amazing. And what she does, she, some of her penthouses
[00:26:26] that she's represented, she does really, really cool videos for. So go check it out. It's awesome.
[00:26:31] It's very elegant. It's cool. It's captivating, compelling. And every agent can learn a lot from
[00:26:36] watching your Instagram. All right, Carrie McCormick, R.E. is where you find that.
[00:26:40] Or Carrie McCormick real estate, rather. And we'll have a link to that in the show notes.
[00:26:43] Reach out to Carrie at at properties.com. If you want to chat with her. And she also message
[00:26:49] her phone. So Carrie, thank you for again, being on our show for many, many, many years now. And
[00:26:56] this is the weekend time. So now it's crunch time for you. So I'm going to let you enjoy the little
[00:27:01] time you have before you have to start cranking it out with your clients this weekend. But I am going
[00:27:07] to, I'm going to do nothing this weekend. So you can help me. But I'm also going to earn no money
[00:27:11] this weekend. So I'd rather be, I think I'd rather be busy. But I'm going to relax. Anyway,
[00:27:16] everyone have a wonderful time. Carrie, thank you for being on the show on behalf of the audience.
[00:27:21] By the way, we are coming up on, I don't even know how many episodes 600 something now. So we are

But please, everyone else visit Carrie at her website, Carrie McCormick, R-E.com. Most importantly, follow her on Instagram. She is the queen of Instagram and does it all herself and it's truly remarkable. We have agents at our firm who don't even know that I know Carrie who come up to me and are like, oh my god, have you ever seen Carrie McCormick's Instagram? She does incredible things with drones and just your videos are insane. So it's Carrie McCormick real estate. We'll have a link to both of those in the show notes. Please follow her. Carrie, welcome once again to the show. Thank you. That's quite the introduction and I appreciate it. I think about you a lot because when I go home, I'm like the only reason I know about this is years ago you were like, oh, I have this development coming up and I was like, I'll go support my friend and go check it out. I had no intention of buying anything. And then like six months later, I was buying it and it's like was one of the best decisions I've ever made. Oh, I'm so happy. Oh, I love it. I love it. So anyway, big fan of yours, of course. What's what do you want to talk about today? So I was going to focus on a few things. The first part I'd like to focus on is just with our sellers and our buyers with sellers getting their homes ready for the market. And then on the other side of it is what buyers are looking for when they're out. You know, obviously we're trying to match the two. So the seller's selling, buyers buying. And what do we need to do to prep everyone for the market? So that's the first half I want to talk about. And then the second half is going to be talking about other markets. So I'm in Chicago and working with other brokers in other markets. So first off, you know, over the last couple of years, I call them Instagram homes. Everyone's becoming so spoiled with looking at homes on Instagram or HTTV or whatever it is. And they want everything perfect, right? So what we've been doing with the sellers, things have been dated in homes, right? And, you know, furniture is dated. The finishes are dated. So I've been taking a little bit more time with my sellers of prepping the homes. It's a lot of work. It's a lot of hard conversations to have with sellers. You know, whether it's the paint color, it's the lighting, the furniture, you know, because it's personal to them. So, you know, curating a group of people that can come into the home and help have that conversation, right? There's a company here in Chicago. I think they might be actually nationals called Kirbyo, which has been phenomenal. That comes in and they will put a quote together for the home. A lot of success stories around this. So again, just simple painting, lighting, staging the home makes a world of a difference of time on the market. And then also, of course, their purchase price. I've had sellers that push back against this of like, no, my house looks great. You know, I'm not spending any money on it. And the house does it. Linger's on the market, right? It doesn't get the price that we want it to. So it's the hard truth that we've got to tell sellers. So I would say is put that investment in, you know, as a broker of educating the sellers of what does it mean to them? And then also show them stats, show them success stories of what's happened. It takes a few additional weeks to get all of that work done, but it's definitely worth it. So in the place I live that you represented, we have all white finishes, which is super stole modern and cool and lovely. And at some point, maybe that won't be cool anymore, right? Like 20 years from now, people will be like, why did everyone go all white? But I love it. But in 20 years, I might have to consider making adjustments if I want to sell it, because maybe that won't be in vogue. Do you ever have situations where like we think about the granite countertops of the past, which could be some funky colors? And sometimes maybe it was cool at the time, 2005, but today kind of doesn't look right. Are you ever telling the sellers, hey, we got to swap that out? Yes. Yeah. And, you know, part of my job is becoming having this great network of people. So I can call the stone person. I can call the cabinet person. I can call the carper person, whatever it is. So having an army of people ready for a phone call, but that's what I was mentioning, this company, Kerbio, because they do everything. Right. So, you know, create your network of people that are able to come into the house to do some of the work that needs to be done. Or also have alternatives, because, you know, ripping out countertops is a big deal. And it's expensive. You know, so there's a color called Uba Tuba for those that are around my age. Probably remember that granite that was such a popular granite. It's green. And it's actually kind of pretty. But, you know, even if you painted the cabinets, you paint them, you know, a white or an off white or something, it makes that Uba Tuba not look so bad anymore. So, again, you know, having examples to show people, having case studies to show people. Again, you know, I say to, you know, my sellers that are pushing back against them, like, let's just get a quote. You know, let's just let me do the letter. It's a great way to let me bring some people in. Let's see how much it is. And again, once you start bringing these other trades in, they, you know, they're trying to sell their service too. So it just, it becomes a dialogue that we have. And at the end, it's usually, all right, Kerry, you're right. Let's do it. Let's get everyone going. And we end up doing it. Again, from my side, I look at it, you know, invests two weeks in getting all these trades in there and getting all these quotes done. But really, once the work is done, the house doesn't sit on the market. Right. So it's, you're going to have to sit on it one way or the other, whether it's at the beginning or it's at the, you know, when the house is on the market. So it's better to get a better price. You're client in the long run is, is very happy because you got their home sold quickly and at a high price. So again, it's investing all that in upfront. Yeah, it's, it's so funny. If I think back to like how social media, especially Instagram works currently where we have a photo we want, or we'll talk about a video, a photo we want to share. And we click a, you know, we tap on the phone and it enhances the image and it makes it look even more perfect than maybe the shot we took. Or we take a picture of ourselves and we smooth out the wrinkles or whatever we do. You know, white and our teeth and all those things you do afterwards. And people are used to seeing that perfection now without doing any work to get to the perfection. So I think I'm wondering if, but most buyers, when they walk into a place, if they do see a countertop that maybe is not as invoked today, you know, yes, could you swap it out? Of course, and you could build that into the contract. And I think people aren't as easily understanding that it's just a matter of swapping it out, whether you're on the buy side or the sell side. But it is, I think people just kind of want perfection as opposed to, yeah. And so I'm sure you do have to have a lot of hard conversations like, hey, this really isn't the style anymore. And people are going to come in here. And even though we know that we could swap it out or they could swap it out, we don't want them to have to think about that extra step. Right. Right. Or, you know, again, renderings is a great idea too of providing, you know, everyone's so visual. And, you know, you talked about just immediate gratification. No one has time. No one has vision. So, you know, again, part of our job is to create that. But we have to be careful of not to push it on the seller because I always say, sellers, they don't want to do anything, right? Right. They want us to do all the legwork. So if you're going to, if you're going to propose these ideas, be ready to do the work, not physically, but, you know, get everybody in line and do it and perform on it. So, again, don't go in there saying, Mr. Mr. Mrs. seller, this is what you have to do. You go find your own people and let me know. Again, it's our job to curate everything and make a seamless experience for them. So, it'll make your job easy in the long run. And you're probably then managing contractors and services like Curbio and you're probably employing Curbio to do that management of the, so you don't have to worry, gosh, they didn't show up today. And now my seller's pissed because they were supposed to swap out the cabinets today and nobody showed up. Right. Or, if I have a good general contractor that you trust and that you know. And that's, you know, I've been doing this for quite some time. So, you know, I feel like I've got some incredible resources. But I'm always looking for new ones and just, you know, different things to offer my clients. And as I mentioned, our sellers are busy, so they want you to do the work. Yeah. Do you ever have issues with the seller saying, well, how much more will this make me or how much more will this sell for? Do you have data to back that up or how are you having those conversations? Yeah. And actually, that's a really great point. And I think that's very important is to have the data, right. And that's why I say like case studies, you could actually as a broker go in the market and just say, okay, here's, here's two homes that are similar to yours. This one has white cabinets, painted white. I'm just making up a story, right. And this one's priced at two million. You know, this home has cherry cabinets and uba-tuba countertops and it's priced at 1.7. So there's a 300,000 delta there. You know, let me get a quote. If the quote comes in at 150, right. Kind of an over and over. Kind of a no brainer. So again, you do have to lay it out for them and show them what the value is. And again, you have to be very careful because, you know, you have to make sure that your numbers are right. You don't want your client to spend $150,000. And they're like expecting you to get, you know, double or whatever it is. So you do have to be very careful with your data, but it's super important. What about sellers? Or sorry, so that's, we talked about what buyers want. What is it that sellers? Why, you know, is there anything else that a, for example, you know, what are sellers looking for? You mean buyers? Well, yeah, I mean, we're, so when you work with sellers, it's more about just getting the house ready. What a, what actually back to sellers for a second? What about the exterior assuming it's a single family home? What are, what are you doing? Is that first impression as they pull up? How critical is that? It still is. It always has been and it still is. So, you know, landscaping is super important because even before someone makes an appointment, they may drive by the home, right? Or photography of the home is going to be super important to have, you know, greenery. So, yeah, some absolutely telling them to make sure that they, you know, have landscaping done. If there's any paint that's chipped out there, it's the first impression. And when someone walks into a house and, you know, the front porch is all chipped up or something, it just shows them of what the interior is going to look like. So absolutely. You know, I would, let's, well, actually, let's transition because I think that's good. Basically, just making the case for improving the home so that it sells faster and for more money. I mean, it's really just that simple. But as I'm thinking about all the people you have to manage for that, that is quite a task. But it's obviously, it's what your job is. And it's probably why you're so successful as you're willing to say, I'll help you with, you know, figuring all this out. And that, did that skill take a long time to develop about what to improve, how to sort of have that conversation? You know, I imagine that probably took years to develop. It does. And I think just like in anything that we do, you know, having the right dialogue with the and every personality is very different, right? So one dialogue I have with one seller is not going to be the same as it is with another. So you really have to go to the room and find out, you know, like, oh, my grandfather built this house or whatever. So I have to be careful of saying, well, you need to do the whole thing, right? So I think just understanding people and having the right dialogue with the right people is important. And going back, though, to the exterior, one thing I also wanted to mention, I'm in Chicago. So it's the weather is not always great here. And, you know, for those who are in communities that don't have leaves on the trees right now, there's, you know, using, like, virtual staging to enhance whether some greenery or I always, I never want to falsify anything, you know, so if there's grass, great, we can make a greener. But if there's not grass, you know, we don't want to add grass. But anyways, using some additional tools like that is a great way, at least online to make the home look a little bit better. Virtual staging's gotten a lot cheaper too because of AI. And so for anyone who hasn't explored it in the last year, you'll find the pricing is way different than it used to be. And the technology's much better. No more. Are we seeing those completely crazy skies that were like, I'm trying to think of, they were so vibrant that they almost, they were almost distracting from the actual home itself. It's still years time, though. Yeah, well, it can be done at just, but again, it's just the technology's getting better to look a little bit more reasonable and realistic. Now, one thing that you're doing that I think is, I've never heard anyone, it's not that I've never heard anyone doing this. I haven't heard anyone doing this in a long time. And I think it's so cool that you're doing this. You're realizing that the pandemic really shifted how we work and people are now able to sort of work most of us, I mean, unless we're real estate agents, we can kind of work wherever. And so the idea is that people are moving, you know, to different areas. And so Kerry, of course, has people coming and going. And she needs to make great relationships with agents in other markets so that they can pass, you know, business back and forth. And she knows that if she's going to pass somebody, for example, with a $2 million client, Kerry, of course, wants to make sure that her support system, her other agents in other markets, of course, are going to do good jobs. You're actually going out and visiting these agents. So tell us a little bit about that. Yeah, so, I mean, you're right. I mean, during the pandemic, everyone was moving around and I was a little bit late to the game because I was so focused on our market here, which was great. But as my clients are moving all over and you know, they're asking for referrals. And I am referring them out, but I'm like, I've never met that agent. You know, like I've talked to them on the phone or, you know, we've done a Zoom or something, but I've really never sat down and met with them. And so what I started to do just as you had mentioned is fly out to what I call our key feeder states. So a lot of people in Chicago moved to Arizona. They moved to Florida. They moved to Tennessee. They moved to Colorado. So I found a few agents out there and I go meet with them face to face. Right? I mean, there's nothing better than sitting down with somebody and having lunch with them or dinner and talking about their business and them getting to know you and more importantly, me getting to know them. What other benefit from that is is understanding their markets. Right? So I love to take a tour. I was just used like Palm Beach as an example. You know, take a tour in their communities. You know, what are they selling? What does the housing inventory look like there? What do they do for marketing? You know, how do they sell a home? So I've gone on listing net listing appointments. I've gone on showings with them. So it's just interesting to hear again, they're not my competition because they're in a different market. But you know, how do they do with a client? You know, so it's you're never not learning, right? So it's been a... You probably get to see other people's, you know, the way they do presentations. And it probably also gives you tips even though, you know, you have a great style of your own, but you probably do learn things from some of these other top agents and other areas. Like I we've had people on the show who sell 20, 30, 40 million dollar homes. And I would love to just be a fly on the wall of what it's like when that team of for the buyer pulls in and it's seven people and they got to like sort of manage all seven of these ex people and make sure all seven of them are like, this is a great home to buy. And I've talked to those agents and they're like, that is a whole skill and in of itself, I'm sure you've dealt with that as well, where you've had multiple people that are involved in the transaction on your side. So but it must be exciting to see other agents and other markets do that. Have you ever thought about possibly even serving another market? I know you're too busy to even consider that, but no, she's shaking her head. No, she is too busy. I made the mistake of asking Carrie when I got on here because it's we're actually recording this on a Friday. I'm like, what are you doing this weekend that she just like looked at me like, what are you getting? I was like, oh, that's right. You're gonna be so weird. It's a weekend. I don't even know what it is. No, but it is it's it's been it's been so great to again meet these brokers in other markets and you know, for those who don't want to travel outside of the market or don't have time to travel outside of the market. Again, even picking up the phone and having a zoo or a call with them, a zoom with them, it's you know, it's you're investing in your business by having the this incredible network. Even like again, an example is an agent in Arizona gave me a referral. She said, my client lives in Arizona. They have a place in Illinois or in Chicago and they want to sell it and you know, I'd like to refer you. I said, okay, great. I went to the home to go look at it and they didn't they don't live here anymore. So they relocated to Arizona. So what I did is so like, okay, great. We love it. Love your presentation. Send us the paperwork and I said, you know what? I'm going to fly. I'm going to come meet you. I'm going to so I flew from Chicago to Arizona to meet the seller to sign the listing paperwork in person. And I mean, it was a big listing number one. But number two, you have no idea how thankful that seller was because I didn't have to go out there. I had the business, right? The docuSign works just fine. But I thought I knew that this seller was extremely connected. I knew the broker was I don't say taking a chance at me, but the broker hadn't met me. So it was I did it two for one. I got to sit down and have dinner with the broker and meet that seller in their own home. So it was just, again, it's doing these little things in your business that are going to make such a big difference. Yeah. And most agents who are making connections in other markets with agents for referral purposes are not traveling to those other markets to meet. And you're right. They probably get calls all day long from agents all over the country saying, I, you know, let's let's connect. But when you meet them in person, obviously, that connection just gets a lot deeper a lot quicker. So that's a great tip. You know, I think that's a great place to wrap up. So I maybe everyone who's listening can think of one feeder market that your either people come or go to in your local area. Where are they moving to? And consider, you know, taking a trip down there, you know, and you know, you know, build it into your budget. Go down there and say, Hey, I really want to build a strong relationship. I'm willing to come down here and meet you and hang out with you and see if we'd be a good fit. And then you can meet like probably five, you could probably meet 10 agents in a couple of days and really get a sense of who's who's the best fit. And you know, that's what we should do for anything, right? Like most, most buyers and sellers choose the first REALTOR they, they, they meet. So we know that, you know, it's probably a good idea to get a few, I get a few offers when you're, you know, meeting with doctors or attorneys or lawyers, you know, so this is an opportunity for you to not just look at Zillow and say, who's the biggest agent in that area? But actually go, Hey, I want to come meet you and spend a few hundred dollars to do it. I want everybody to follow Carrie on insta, first of all, before we get to that, if you are somebody who has clients that move into the Chicago land area and you want to have them work with somebody who is considered a legend. And when I say that, Carrie sort of wins is because she doesn't like to think of herself that way, but everyone else see her things over that way. So I'm going to call her a legend. If you want to have your clients work with a legend, Carrie's the right person. So please consider reaching out to her and developing a relationship directly with her and perhaps you guys can do some business back and forth. So what's the best way that if anyone wants to work with you that they should reach out? Yeah. So I was, I'm a big phone person. So call me at 312-9614-612 or send me an email at Carrie, C-A-R-R-R-I-E at atproperties.com. Awesome. And also follow her on Instagram. I am not kidding when I say her Instagram is the best I've seen. Although I will tell you Carrie, there is somebody who is right on your heels. It's a total for a totally different reason. I can't remember the person's name, but he is a guy in New York or Long Island. I don't know if you've seen this guy yet. He is hysterically, he's like straight off of like casting for the sopranos and he plays that part and it's hilarious. Oh, I got to find out who that is. Oh, I'm going to send it. I'll talk about it on a future episode that everybody can watch it. Oh my god, he's he's just, it doesn't mean to be funny. He just is that guy. And you figure like maybe he just waxed somebody and that was selling homes. But it's, but Carrie's, Carrie's is actually amazing. And what she does, she, some of her penthouses that she's represented, she does really, really cool videos for. So go check it out. It's awesome. It's very elegant. It's cool. It's captivating, compelling. And every agent can learn a lot from watching your Instagram. All right, Carrie McCormick, R.E. is where you find that. Or Carrie McCormick real estate, rather.
