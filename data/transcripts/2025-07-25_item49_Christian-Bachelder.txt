[00:01:15] Today's episode is brought to you by corded.io.
[00:01:18] Are you looking for agents to join your brokerage or team?
[00:01:23] Now as a real estate recruiter,
[00:01:24] I can tell you the answer is always yes.
[00:01:27] But most agents aren't looking to move right now.
[00:01:29] So how do you know who to contact?
[00:01:32] Well, what if I were to tell you
[00:01:33] there's a recruiting and retention tool
[00:01:34] powered by artificial intelligence
[00:01:37] that shows you exactly which agents in your local market
[00:01:40] are looking to leave their brokerage right now
[00:01:42] and which agents at your own firm
[00:01:45] are also looking to leave you.
[00:01:47] Now I've been recruiting REALTORS for 15 years
[00:01:50] and I've hired over 2000 agents.
[00:01:52] I can tell you with no exaggeration,
[00:01:55] this is the tool I've been waiting for.
[00:01:57] Corded's AI looks for trends across dozens of variables
[00:02:00] for each agent in your market
[00:02:01] and shows you which agents they believe are likely to move.
[00:02:05] Not only does it do that,
[00:02:06] but corded's AI went and visited my recruiting website
[00:02:10] and read everything I offer.
[00:02:11] So now when I'm recruiting,
[00:02:13] corded's AI tells me exactly what to say
[00:02:16] based on that agent's needs and what my brokerage can offer.
[00:02:19] It even writes emails for me.
[00:02:21] I've never seen anything like it
[00:02:23] and I use it every single day.
[00:02:26] Now if you are looking to grow your brokerage,
[00:02:28] corded.io is the best tool out there.
[00:02:31] Visit corded.io to schedule a demo again.
[00:02:34] That's corded.io and now onto the show.
[00:02:57] I'm your guide and host through the show today
[00:03:00] is our monthly series called Learn with a Lender
[00:03:03] with Christian Batchelder.
[00:03:05] I want to tell you more about Christian
[00:03:07] if you're new to our show.
[00:03:08] By the way, even if you are new to our show,
[00:03:11] if you are familiar with bigger pockets,
[00:03:12] you'll know Christian for sure.
[00:03:14] He and his partner David Green,
[00:03:15] we're gonna give you a little bit of background
[00:03:16] on Christian right now.
[00:03:18] But together with David Green,
[00:03:19] Christian co-founded the one brokerage,
[00:03:21] which was deemed the fastest growing broker in the nation
[00:03:24] in 2021 and 2022,
[00:03:26] also ranked in the top 20 brokerages
[00:03:29] by funded loan volume.
[00:03:31] Christian is a UC Berkeley grad.
[00:03:33] He has a bachelor's in chemical engineering,
[00:03:35] but he hated the industry.
[00:03:36] And wanted to get out of a capped earning potential.
[00:03:39] So he got into real estate with the help of a childhood
[00:03:41] family friend who had some success in the business
[00:03:43] and discovered that Christian had a knack
[00:03:45] for connecting with people and adding value
[00:03:47] to their mindsets,
[00:03:48] also their investments as well as their journey.
[00:03:51] He's a licensed real estate agent,
[00:03:53] insurance and mortgage broker.
[00:03:55] He regularly hosts masterminds seminars and webinars
[00:03:58] with real estate gurus.
[00:03:59] He teaches people everything from investing principles
[00:04:02] on how to buy your thousandth property
[00:04:04] with a focus on what markets to target,
[00:04:06] how to find the best loans,
[00:04:08] and how to protect ones investments
[00:04:09] with insurance policies and other forms of asset protection.
[00:04:13] Christian himself has purchased 15 properties
[00:04:15] in the last 12 months.
[00:04:17] We're employing the exact same principles
[00:04:19] that he's teaching us on this podcast.
[00:04:21] He created a course for loan officers to enroll
[00:04:23] to teach the fundamentals of the sales process,
[00:04:26] how to become the best advisor possible,
[00:04:28] how to get the most out of this career path
[00:04:30] and tips on succeeding in any market.
[00:04:32] I want everybody to give Christian
[00:04:34] and his team an opportunity on your next loan,
[00:04:37] your next client loan, go to v1brokeridge.com
[00:04:40] and one is the number one.
[00:04:42] So v1brokeridge.com or find Christian online.
[00:04:46] He is everywhere and he is often sought after
[00:04:49] by lots of organizations to speak specifically
[00:04:52] about the state of the market.
[00:04:53] He's gonna do that today.
[00:04:55] And Christian, welcome back to the show.
[00:04:56] Absolutely, I appreciate you having me.
[00:04:58] Looking forward to this one.
[00:04:59] Yeah, I am such a big fan of you and David
[00:05:02] and what you, I tell you,
[00:05:03] you guys' name comes up all the time
[00:05:06] when I talk to anyone who's an agent,
[00:05:08] who's an investor who obviously knows bigger pockets.
[00:05:10] Like they all know you.
[00:05:12] And so it's just, it's a lot of fun to have you here.
[00:05:14] And I've had David on the show before many years ago
[00:05:17] and that was a great episode as well.
[00:05:19] But let's, yeah, let's talk.
[00:05:21] So we got a question from the audience
[00:05:22] that I thought was a particularly good one
[00:05:24] and you had a really unique take on it.
[00:05:26] We were talking just a few minutes ago,
[00:05:28] but the question was to the, I'm paraphrasing.
[00:05:30] But it was, hey, I'm an agent
[00:05:31] and I have a lot of my sellers or my owners
[00:05:34] or Heather who would like to sell
[00:05:36] but don't want to give up that 3% rate.
[00:05:39] They know they want or need to move
[00:05:41] in the next few years,
[00:05:42] but they're just not quite ready to give up.
[00:05:45] I mean, I'm in that boat.
[00:05:46] I certainly understand that pain point.
[00:05:48] I'm going to be moving in the next probably year.
[00:05:51] I'm gonna be giving up that rate,
[00:05:53] but that's a voluntary thing for me
[00:05:54] because it's better for me to do that now
[00:05:57] when there's less competition.
[00:05:58] So there's some, maybe some logic there possibly.
[00:06:01] But certainly it's a painful thing.
[00:06:03] So I guess the question is what would you,
[00:06:05] or the question being what would you say to a REALTOR
[00:06:07] who says, hey, I've got these clients,
[00:06:09] they want to move in the near term,
[00:06:12] but they don't want to give up the rate.
[00:06:14] Yeah, I mean, my mind immediately goes to a couple options.
[00:06:17] I mean, the first one is the client,
[00:06:18] you know, you have to understand that your client
[00:06:19] has a point, right?
[00:06:21] That's the thing is agents get into this idea
[00:06:23] that you have to sell, you know,
[00:06:25] you learn one thing to sell
[00:06:26] and you have to sell it, you know,
[00:06:27] square peg into a round hole so to speak, right?
[00:06:29] Like, you have to sell it all the time.
[00:06:30] And it's possible.
[00:06:31] I mean, obviously that client needs to move,
[00:06:33] you know, it's possible you should hear them out, right?
[00:06:35] I mean, as a, absolutely, if you had a 3% rate,
[00:06:37] I wouldn't want to lose it either, right?
[00:06:38] I don't have any 3% rates.
[00:06:39] I refinance that of all of mine.
[00:06:40] So I'm kind of the living proof of how to, you know,
[00:06:44] scale even through the pain points of losing good rates.
[00:06:48] But in reality, there are options
[00:06:50] that you can just talk through with your client
[00:06:52] to make sure that they understand kind of the whole,
[00:06:54] you know, the whole process, right?
[00:06:57] The first one being the equity in that property isn't locked.
[00:07:01] What I mean by that is, let's say you're living in,
[00:07:04] you know, a single family, you bought it in 2020 for 500K,
[00:07:07] it's worth 600 now, you know, and you,
[00:07:10] oh, you've paid down your mortgage a bit.
[00:07:11] Let's say you owe 400,000 on it, right?
[00:07:14] Part of that equity you can tap and do.
[00:07:16] You can do things like a HELOC,
[00:07:18] you can do what we kind of in the industry call a HELOAN,
[00:07:20] which is basically just a fancy word for a second mortgage.
[00:07:24] And that allows you to protect the interest rate, right?
[00:07:27] Protect your third, you're 3%, you're 4%,
[00:07:29] maybe you're 2%, right?
[00:07:30] Depending on when you got it.
[00:07:32] And still access some of the equity in that property.
[00:07:35] Now, there are limitations of the program,
[00:07:37] you have to qualify and all that.
[00:07:39] But all of that aside, the fundamental idea
[00:07:42] that most people believe, hey, I have a 3% rate,
[00:07:46] but I have all this equity in this property.
[00:07:47] I talked to a guy today who's got almost a $2 million
[00:07:50] single family property in the Bay Area,
[00:07:52] and he owes 300,000 on it.
[00:07:54] He's like, I can't refi.
[00:07:57] Right.
[00:07:58] Why not?
[00:07:59] He's like, well, I have a 3% rate, I won't lose that.
[00:08:01] No matter what your pitch is to me, I won't lose that.
[00:08:03] I said, cool, let's do a HELOC and he said, what's that?
[00:08:06] And I'm like, well, what if I can put like 500 K in your pocket?
[00:08:10] He's like, I'd love that,
[00:08:11] but I'm not giving up my 3% rate.
[00:08:13] I said, you don't have to, brother, it's fine.
[00:08:15] Don't worry about it, right?
[00:08:16] And there are options there.
[00:08:18] Now, we obviously don't want to over leverage properties.
[00:08:21] I'm not the lender that just sells loans by any term.
[00:08:23] By any means necessary, right?
[00:08:25] Just like I don't believe real-idors
[00:08:26] should sell listing properties by any means necessary.
[00:08:29] But our job as advisors and guides,
[00:08:33] so to speak, in the financial industry,
[00:08:35] is to give people options.
[00:08:36] It's not to make decisions for them, right?
[00:08:39] If people understand what's in front of them,
[00:08:41] they understand, hey, I can go get some equity.
[00:08:44] Obviously, that HELOC will have a payment, right?
[00:08:46] So we don't want to over leverage,
[00:08:48] we don't want to push it into the non-
[00:08:50] whether it's a parental property and you're not cash flowing,
[00:08:53] or if it's a primary and you're pushing above
[00:08:55] your comfort threshold.
[00:08:57] It is an option, right?
[00:09:00] And my classic kind of work around to people
[00:09:03] in this position is, we'll keep that property
[00:09:05] at a two and a half or 3% rate.
[00:09:07] The chances are probably pretty high that you would cash flow.
[00:09:10] Because your mortgage payment is so low
[00:09:12] compared to what more likely
[00:09:14] to not rental income is for that property.
[00:09:17] In most markets, maybe there's some markets
[00:09:19] where people are going to point at me and say,
[00:09:21] you're wrong, my house won't cover the mortgage.
[00:09:22] Okay, but most markets, if you have a two and a half percent rate
[00:09:26] and you rent that bad boy out, it's going to cash flow.
[00:09:28] Right?
[00:09:29] I would hope so.
[00:09:30] So somebody sitting on a $500,000 mortgage,
[00:09:33] maybe we go put a $100,000 key lock on it.
[00:09:36] And now you're borrowing 600 total from that property.
[00:09:39] You have the $100,000 for your new down payment, right?
[00:09:42] And that can be purchasing a new 10% down
[00:09:45] on a million dollar property, whatever you want to do with it,
[00:09:47] right?
[00:09:48] But the average weight of that large first mortgage,
[00:09:53] 500K in this example, being at such a low rate,
[00:09:56] you don't have to sell that to move.
[00:09:58] If you just moved out and converted it to a rental,
[00:10:01] now I know not everybody wants to be a landlord fair,
[00:10:04] but just strictly speaking from like
[00:10:06] the best financial advice I could give,
[00:10:09] being a landlord is worth saving your 2% rate.
[00:10:12] 100, yes, 100%.
[00:10:13] It just is.
[00:10:15] And you know, you hear a horror story,
[00:10:16] so what if my tenants don't pay
[00:10:18] and all the nightmares that can happen?
[00:10:20] Sure, there's ways to mitigate that
[00:10:22] with good property management and due diligence
[00:10:25] on your tenants for sure.
[00:10:26] But keeping a property where you're basically
[00:10:29] borrowing money for free.
[00:10:31] Yeah.
[00:10:32] Now that sounds weird, but hear me out.
[00:10:35] If that money, 500 gram, is sitting in a bank account,
[00:10:40] it's losing money.
[00:10:42] People don't see it that way because the dollar amount
[00:10:44] doesn't go down, but it is
[00:10:45] because inflation exists.
[00:10:47] Right.
[00:10:47] So every year, unless you say we're being very lenient
[00:10:51] and say inflation's 3%, it's not,
[00:10:54] but let's just pretend.
[00:10:55] Right.
[00:10:56] The price that was only 3%.
[00:10:57] Yeah, let's just pretend like the CPI is accurate.
[00:11:00] Right.
[00:11:00] And I'm using term CPI is the consumer price index.
[00:11:03] That's basically how the federal government
[00:11:05] monitors inflation, but it's a very flawed tool.
[00:11:09] They basically nitpick, which, you know,
[00:11:12] they cherry pick which ones actually go into the bucket.
[00:11:15] But if your money sitting in your bank account
[00:11:17] is losing 3% in our example per year,
[00:11:19] and you have a 2.5% rate,
[00:11:21] you're borrowing other people's money
[00:11:24] for less return than their money is losing.
[00:11:28] 
[00:11:28] That bank is really losing giving you a 2.5% rate.
[00:11:33] Now, we're not in the business of making sure banks succeed.
[00:11:36] So you should take advantage of that.
[00:11:38] If that's you, right?
[00:11:39] Like who cares if your bank's making money?
[00:11:41] Trust me, they're doing fine.
[00:11:42] Right.
[00:11:43] But if you're in a position where you're borrowing less
[00:11:45] than inflation, if inflation is 3% and you're at 2.5%,
[00:11:48] even if you're at 3%, even if you're par with inflation,
[00:11:52] you're basically still borrowing money for free.
[00:11:54] 
[00:11:56] So my point there being,
[00:11:59] if you can convert that property,
[00:12:01] still realize all the benefits of real estate ownership,
[00:12:04] still realize appreciation, principal paydown,
[00:12:08] a lot of people forget appreciation of rent, right?
[00:12:11] Even though you may be able to rent it
[00:12:13] for three grand this month,
[00:12:14] what if it's 3,200 next year, 3,500 year after that?
[00:12:19] Like go back and look what people are paying for rent
[00:12:21] in the early 2000s.
[00:12:22] Right.
[00:12:23] It's not what it is now.
[00:12:24] And people forget about that aspect of real estate investing
[00:12:26] is that they just look at their property appraising,
[00:12:28] and they forget about their rent appraising, right?
[00:12:33] And even though most people, especially if a REALTOR
[00:12:35] is pitching them like sell this house by a new one,
[00:12:38] you should really consider the possibility of them
[00:12:41] keeping that house,
[00:12:44] solving both problems of allowing them to hold
[00:12:46] onto the good interest rate,
[00:12:48] utilizing a heat lock to tap into the equity,
[00:12:50] buy a new house, and yes, at market rates that they are today,
[00:12:54] but as DJs let off with,
[00:12:56] there's gonna be much less competition right now.
[00:12:58] So your opportunity to get a price at a lower purchase price
[00:13:00] is so significantly more than it was during COVID.
[00:13:03] And all those people with 2% rates,
[00:13:05] they paid a hundred-
[00:13:07] They overpaid.
[00:13:08] 300 grand more than it was worth it at the time, right?
[00:13:11] Yep.
[00:13:12] And it was validated at that time,
[00:13:14] because it's worth it, because your rate's so low,
[00:13:15] and there's a case to be made there.
[00:13:18] But it kind of locks you in long term,
[00:13:20] which a lot of these people, you know,
[00:13:21] we call it the golden handcuffs in the industry, right?
[00:13:24] Where you just feel like you can't get out.
[00:13:27] And this is a good middle ground workaround solution, right?
[00:13:31] That allows you to keep the benefit
[00:13:32] while still not completely eliminating your ability
[00:13:36] to buy new property as well.
[00:13:37] And potentially, you know, divorces, new kids,
[00:13:39] people have to buy regardless of your rate sometimes.
[00:13:42] And if they're in that position, talk about this.
[00:13:44] It's a good conversation to have as an agent.
[00:13:46] And if you're not having these conversations
[00:13:49] with your LO, with your lender, call Christian and his team.
[00:13:52] They will work with this out with you,
[00:13:54] and they will talk to your clients.
[00:13:55] They're awesome.
[00:13:57] The other idea too, and this is probably, you know,
[00:14:00] a more controversial thought,
[00:14:02] but it's certainly you could make a case for it,
[00:14:03] is if you can't convert that,
[00:14:05] if you can't turn it into a rental property,
[00:14:07] like I have a condo, there's, you know, rules around it,
[00:14:10] I probably just won't be able to do that as much,
[00:14:13] as I would love to never have to sell that property,
[00:14:16] no matter what, even though I won't be living it
[00:14:18] in any year, I would love to not sell it.
[00:14:20] But I probably will have to.
[00:14:22] But if I do, the worst, it wouldn't be the worst idea
[00:14:25] to sell it and rent for a year,
[00:14:28] and just take my winnings off the table, right?
[00:14:29] That's another, it's another not terrible idea
[00:14:32] that people don't typically like to go from ownership
[00:14:35] back to rental, like I get it,
[00:14:37] there's a psychological sort of hurdle there,
[00:14:39] but if you're gonna, like my place is appreciated
[00:14:43] quite a bit in the last four years,
[00:14:45] and you know, I don't know if I can't find something to buy,
[00:14:49] it still might make sense to sell and take my winnings
[00:14:51] off the table, like.
[00:14:52] Yeah, absolutely.
[00:14:54] And speaking of from somebody who rents where they live,
[00:14:57] and purchase his investment properties,
[00:14:58] I don't own my primary, which sounds funny.
[00:15:02] But I don't because I choose to instead invest my capital
[00:15:06] into cashling real estate, right?
[00:15:08] I'm a huge component of real estate,
[00:15:10] from myself personally, I'm not a huge component
[00:15:12] of owning where I live because I view that as a net loss
[00:15:15] because I can rent for cheaper, right?
[00:15:17] Right, I always think too, it's funny when we think
[00:15:19] about our primary residence as an asset.
[00:15:21] I'm like, it's not really an asset until the day you sell it,
[00:15:24] that it's an asset because you see actual money.
[00:15:27] Other than that, it is a money pit, that is what it is,
[00:15:30] and there's value in owning a property.
[00:15:34] There's value there, but it is not, I don't think,
[00:15:37] and I'm sure you could argue probably both sides of this,
[00:15:40] but to see it as an asset is,
[00:15:43] and I just gave myself a thumbs up
[00:15:44] for watching that was accidental.
[00:15:46] That did not mean to do that, it's Apple stuff.
[00:15:49] But anyway, you could argue it's not an asset
[00:15:51] because it costs money and it's not generating income.
[00:15:55] Yeah, and there's some exceptions
[00:15:56] with like house hackers or fee buyables and family,
[00:15:58] but that's not the battle in the 40 of people.
[00:16:00] Totally.
[00:16:01] And there's still something to be said,
[00:16:02] you are still building equity over the long term.
[00:16:04] A lot of people use their home as their retirement subsidy,
[00:16:07] right? I mean, that's, there's absolutely a justification,
[00:16:10] and then just quality of life, right?
[00:16:11] I mean, you own your own place,
[00:16:12] you can do the renovations you want.
[00:16:15] I get both sides just, it's more of a personal preference.
[00:16:18] I don't have kids, I'm not in a position
[00:16:20] where I need a bunch of space.
[00:16:23] So if you're in that position, obviously,
[00:16:25] make the right decision for you, right?
[00:16:27] And that's something that you should be talking to your agent about
[00:16:29] or talking to your lender about what you call black war, right?
[00:16:31] For sure. And again, I love the fact that you own a ridiculous
[00:16:36] number of properties.
[00:16:37] And yet your primary is like, I'll just rent and I'll move when I want
[00:16:40] and I'll go where I want.
[00:16:41] And that still makes the most sense in your situation.
[00:16:45] And because you are taking the capital,
[00:16:48] you would be putting that for a down payment
[00:16:49] and you are actually putting that money to work for you.
[00:16:52] So you're actually using that money to make money.
[00:16:54] And the rent I imagine is almost negligible.
[00:16:58] I'm guessing it's almost like, it's fine because everything else is.
[00:17:02] Like I'm here to a mortgage in my area,
[00:17:03] I live in Southern California.
[00:17:06] It's significantly different, right?
[00:17:07] I mean, my monthly payment to buy a house that I'd want to live in
[00:17:11] probably three to four times what my rent is, right?
[00:17:14] Amazing.
[00:17:14] So I'm saving quite a bit.
[00:17:16] And once again, that's a personal decision.
[00:17:18] That's not something that I'm repising everybody to do.
[00:17:20] You know, if you've got two, three kids and a dog
[00:17:21] and you need a backyard and all the amenities, I get it.
[00:17:25] But it's just something to think about, you know,
[00:17:27] especially somebody who, you know,
[00:17:29] fresh out of college or something, you know,
[00:17:30] get your feet under you, you know, get your investing started.
[00:17:33] And it's possible to invest early, right?
[00:17:35] There are markets where you can invest with very small down payments.
[00:17:39] And I love you, you have a lot of great sort of retirement ideas
[00:17:43] around investing in real estate.
[00:17:46] You talked about your primary being a possible vehicle
[00:17:49] for a lot of people for their retirement.
[00:17:50] And you can actually be a lot more efficient and effective
[00:17:53] by taking money out and, you know, buying properties year over year.
[00:17:58] And you do that.
[00:18:00] You guys do that and you are big proponents of it.
[00:18:03] And that is your retirement plan.
[00:18:05] And I love that you're doing that.
[00:18:06] And so, for example, my point with saying this
[00:18:09] and you can go back to previous episodes
[00:18:10] or just reach out to Christian and his team,
[00:18:12] they will explain to you some of these philosophies
[00:18:14] that are truly creative and are amazingly effective,
[00:18:18] which is why Christian's such a great asset to our show.
[00:18:22] But if you're not familiar with these,
[00:18:23] you almost owe it to your clients as a REALTOR.
[00:18:27] You owe it to your clients to at least have a general awareness
[00:18:29] of what this is, how this could work.
[00:18:31] And just knowing this alone will help differentiate you
[00:18:34] for most other agents.
[00:18:35] So, whether or not somebody decides to buy a property every year,
[00:18:39] which Christian and his team can show them guys how to do that,
[00:18:42] it's still a cool thing to bring to a client
[00:18:44] and say, have you thought about doing this?
[00:18:45] And it's a really cool thing to do yourself.
[00:18:47] Because what will happen is, as you start investing,
[00:18:51] you're gonna attract other investors.
[00:18:52] Other people are going to notice what you're doing
[00:18:54] and you are going to them being able to say,
[00:18:57] oh, I can show you how to do this.
[00:18:58] And now all of a sudden you've built in business for yourself.
[00:19:00] 100%.
[00:19:00] Yeah, I mean, the best agents, I wouldn't say the best,
[00:19:04] but very good agents typically tend towards investing
[00:19:07] themselves, right?
[00:19:07] It's always make a joke.
[00:19:09] You know, if you walk into a BMW dealership
[00:19:11] and your salesman is driving Mercedes, right?
[00:19:15] What are you doing?
[00:19:16] You're going to Mercedes.
[00:19:17] Yeah, what are we doing?
[00:19:18] Like, you know, if you believe in the car
[00:19:20] and you're selling to other people,
[00:19:21] like you should probably be driving one, right?
[00:19:23] 
[00:19:23] I'm using an employee discount or whatever you got, right?
[00:19:26] Right.
[00:19:27] And it's a significant discount as a REALTOR.
[00:19:29] You're saving 2.5% or whatever, you know,
[00:19:32] whatever your brokerage allows you to do.
[00:19:33] But I mean, at our brokerage, you know,
[00:19:35] you could just roll the whole thing in
[00:19:37] and that's a huge, yeah, use that discount.
[00:19:40] So reach out to Christian and his team
[00:19:41] if you have not explored this option for yourself
[00:19:43] or for your clients.
[00:19:44] This is a great phone call to have
[00:19:46] with everyone that's a homeowner,
[00:19:48] especially people who have bought in the last seven years.
[00:19:50] Their home value is appreciated in most cases.
[00:19:54] This, you want to at least give them an updated estimate
[00:19:57] and say, hey, I was looking at your zestimate online.
[00:19:59] I think it's actually a little inaccurate.
[00:20:00] I'm going to rerun it for you
[00:20:02] and show you what I think it's really worth.
[00:20:03] And I got a creative idea for you,
[00:20:05] whether or not you want to do it up to you,
[00:20:07] but I just thought I'd throw it your way.
[00:20:08] People are going to be so impressed.
[00:20:10] All right, let's also do a quick state of the market.
[00:20:13] I know rates have kind of been jumping around a bit
[00:20:15] in the last week or so.
[00:20:16] They were in the sevens.
[00:20:17] Now they're I think in the high sixes.
[00:20:19] And again, we don't really care so much
[00:20:21] about where rates are today,
[00:20:22] but what is going on currently with rates?
[00:20:26] Nobody has a crystal ball,
[00:20:27] but what are you sort of thinking about
[00:20:30] the future of rates right now?
[00:20:32] Yeah, we're in a, I feel like the biggest term
[00:20:35] you've heard the last few years is unprecedented
[00:20:37] from COVID, everything that's happened since then.
[00:20:39] But financially speaking, we're in a very interesting time.
[00:20:43] Obviously we have kind of done
[00:20:44] a lot of tariffs happening.
[00:20:46] And whether that's a positive or negative impact
[00:20:48] long term is yet to be seen.
[00:20:52] But you know, the markets are responding accordingly, right?
[00:20:56] The original thought was that tariffs
[00:20:59] would directly lead to inflation, right?
[00:21:01] They would directly lead to increased cost of goods,
[00:21:04] which at least in the short term here,
[00:21:07] we haven't really seen.
[00:21:08] Not yet.
[00:21:09] Echro scale yet.
[00:21:10] Now to be fair, a lot of the tariffs have been paused
[00:21:13] and they're just now starting to get implemented.
[00:21:15] So that may be kind of a deferred symptom of that,
[00:21:19] so to speak.
[00:21:20] But we'll see, right?
[00:21:22] If they do prove to be inflationary,
[00:21:25] that will typically lead towards higher rates
[00:21:28] because we need to combat that inflation back down
[00:21:30] and the way the Fed has historically done that
[00:21:32] is by pulling the rate lever, right?
[00:21:35] And just so everybody understands,
[00:21:36] why do you drop rates or increase rates
[00:21:38] to kind of stay in line with inflation?
[00:21:41] The general idea just kind of breaking it down
[00:21:43] and kind of layman's terms,
[00:21:45] if inflation is high,
[00:21:47] that means the price of goods are like out of control, right?
[00:21:51] Inflation is going crazy, that means,
[00:21:53] but people are still buying typically, right?
[00:21:56] When you increase rates, you retract demand
[00:22:00] because there's less like volatility of money
[00:22:03] through the market.
[00:22:04] There's less loans being given,
[00:22:06] there's less things being given to small businesses
[00:22:08] that play their staff,
[00:22:09] it's kind of a trickle down effect, right?
[00:22:11] When rates go up,
[00:22:12] it basically constricts the economy.
[00:22:14] It's not a good thing.
[00:22:15] We don't like increasing rates,
[00:22:17] but you have to close everything down.
[00:22:19] Yeah, it's a slowing down basically.
[00:22:21] We don't like doing it,
[00:22:22] but you have to because the alternative
[00:22:24] is run away inflation and nobody wants to see,
[00:22:27] $49 eggs, right?
[00:22:30] So that's what the Fed will typically do
[00:22:31] to kind of stifle inflation.
[00:22:33] Where we're at right now is the Fed believes
[00:22:37] inflation to be coming through tariffs,
[00:22:40] but it's not seen yet.
[00:22:42] So the argument is we're going to keep rates high
[00:22:46] as a precursor to stifling that inflation that may come.
[00:22:52] The counter argument is there's no inflation yet.
[00:22:55] So why are we keeping rates high, right?
[00:22:58] So the argument is why don't we drop rates for now
[00:23:00] and if inflation comes, we raise rates in the future.
[00:23:02] That's when you hear Trump calling Jerome Powell
[00:23:04] like a doofus and you know,
[00:23:05] a two late pal and all the things he likes to throw out, right?
[00:23:08] That's what he's referencing is sure,
[00:23:11] let's drop rates and fine,
[00:23:14] if my tariffs leads inflation will handle it at them.
[00:23:17] And Jerome Powell's kind of dig in his feed in.
[00:23:19] I think depending on if this kind of maintains
[00:23:23] par for the course, I do think rates in the long term
[00:23:26] the one, two, kind of three year range
[00:23:28] are scheduled to come down.
[00:23:29] I think it's impossible for them not to.
[00:23:31] We owe so much money,
[00:23:34] so you guys understand that the rate that is set
[00:23:36] on like the prime rate by the Fed,
[00:23:38] that dictates the amount of interest
[00:23:40] that America has to pay to their bond holders,
[00:23:42] which a lot of them are other countries.
[00:23:45] So if we drop those rates,
[00:23:46] we drop the interest payments we make
[00:23:48] and it actually saves America as a country a lot of money,
[00:23:51] which I think that that'll eventually just kind of crack
[00:23:54] the decision it just has to, right?
[00:23:57] There's too much money on the table.
[00:23:58] Like I think if we drop by 1% America saves like,
[00:24:00] it's some looting, it's like $900 billion
[00:24:02] or something crazy in interest payments,
[00:24:04] it's like an unfathomable amount of money, right?
[00:24:09] But that's that.
[00:24:09] The big thing obviously we just had the big beautiful bill
[00:24:12] affectionately called, right?
[00:24:14] That did have a number of impacts specifically
[00:24:18] on real estate and investors particularly,
[00:24:20] and I wanna make sure I don't let this episode go by
[00:24:22] with at least addressing it briefly.
[00:24:25] The biggest thing by far for real estate specifically
[00:24:29] is the return of 100% bonus depreciation.
[00:24:32] That came back with the big beautiful bill.
[00:24:36] And what that means depreciation is a hard concept to grasp
[00:24:39] and let me see if I can explain it as well as I can.
[00:24:42] When you buy a property or really in that manner,
[00:24:45] any asset, a car, a boat, a plane, anything,
[00:24:49] every year that you own that piece of asset,
[00:24:52] whatever it is, it gets less and less valuable.
[00:24:56] That's the idea of depreciation
[00:24:57] when something depreciates, it's wearing away, right?
[00:25:01] Well, the American tax code has an ability for you
[00:25:04] to write off the loss that that asset is generating every year.
[00:25:10] Now, it's not like a lot of people think,
[00:25:11] oh, I'm writing it off, so like,
[00:25:12] I have to go pay the depreciation man.
[00:25:14] It's not a real expense, it's a paper expense.
[00:25:16] It's just saying that this asset that I buy
[00:25:19] is less and less every year because it's older.
[00:25:22] It costs more to upkeep, things break.
[00:25:25] You know, if it's a home, your HVAC goes down
[00:25:27] or your roof starts to wear away,
[00:25:29] if it's a plane, you gotta repair the tires,
[00:25:31] the car, the tires, all these things.
[00:25:33] It just takes more to the expense, right?
[00:25:36] And what bonus depreciation is,
[00:25:39] is it's a tool for investors to front load their depreciation.
[00:25:45] What I mean by that is instead of taking that yearly take,
[00:25:49] like, oh, my house is worth 10 grand less than 10 grand
[00:25:52] and 10 grand, that's the calculation of how much it's worn away.
[00:25:57] Instead, it allows you to take it all in the first year.
[00:26:00] Yeah.
[00:26:02] The reason why that's powerful,
[00:26:04] I'll explain the most common reason
[00:26:06] is to people who use this.
[00:26:08] Let's say you have a husband and wife,
[00:26:11] the husband is a doctor, right?
[00:26:14] High income W. Turner, a doctor, lawyer,
[00:26:16] and attorney, something, right?
[00:26:18] And they pay a lot of income tax.
[00:26:20] Let's say our doctor makes 400K a year
[00:26:22] and he's in California, so he's probably paying close
[00:26:24] to 200K in taxes between the state and federal.
[00:26:27] It's a lot of money.
[00:26:29] What the argument is, is out of that 400,
[00:26:32] he's paying 50%, he pays $200,000 in income tax.
[00:26:37] Instead, if he took that $200,000
[00:26:39] and went and made a down payment on a million dollar property,
[00:26:42] that's 20% down on a million dollars.
[00:26:45] If he costs segregated, which is the study that it's called,
[00:26:48] but really, it allows you to take this depreciation in year one,
[00:26:51] he may get a $200,000 tax write-off from that property
[00:26:57] to give you an idea of what these numbers could be.
[00:26:59] I bought what a $1.6 million property a couple years back
[00:27:04] and I got about a $600,000 write-off for it.
[00:27:07] So it's not like small number, it's significant.
[00:27:11] And what that does is you take that write-off
[00:27:13] and it's only for one year.
[00:27:15] So the argument against depreciation is,
[00:27:17] oh, what about the next year's and sure, but hear me out?
[00:27:21] You get to take that $400,000 write-off, what's that?
[00:27:24] And that completely wipes out his income.
[00:27:27] Now what's his taxable income?
[00:27:29] He has a $400,000 earnings from his W2,
[00:27:31] and he has a $400,000 write-off from that property he bought.
[00:27:36] In IRS's view, you made $0,
[00:27:37] which guess what your tax rate is on $0?
[00:27:41] Yeah.
[00:27:41] Big fat donut, right?
[00:27:44] So basically what he did is he pivoted the $200,000
[00:27:47] that he would have had to pay him taxes anyways,
[00:27:50] and instead he bought a property with him.
[00:27:53] And now you have cash flow potentially,
[00:27:55] even if you don't have cash flow,
[00:27:56] you save 200 grand of taxes.
[00:27:58] It's still a big win.
[00:27:59] But ideally you have cash flow,
[00:28:01] you have appreciation of that property,
[00:28:03] you have somebody paying down your mortgage.
[00:28:05] It's a huge win, right?
[00:28:06] And the argument is next year, you do it again,
[00:28:09] instead of paying taxes, you buy a house, right?
[00:28:11] And you get into this process of,
[00:28:13] it goes along with the other concept of buying one house a year
[00:28:16] where you pay a house with your income tax, right?
[00:28:19] This is an amazing opportunity for people
[00:28:22] to buy a property every year, essentially.
[00:28:23] 
[00:28:24] Especially high W2 income earners
[00:28:26] that have a spouse at home who doesn't work,
[00:28:29] because that spouse at home can take all of those deductions,
[00:28:32] and if you guys file jointly,
[00:28:34] which 90% of couples do, right?
[00:28:37] Her loss can count directly against his income, right?
[00:28:41] And it's a household income, you get taxes
[00:28:43] of married couple, right?
[00:28:44] Very, very, very powerful strategy.
[00:28:47] I'm leaving some details out,
[00:28:49] because there are some requirements
[00:28:50] that you have to do to actually qualify
[00:28:52] for bonus appreciation,
[00:28:54] but without getting two into the weeds,
[00:28:55] I think it's a lot of minutia, but it is possible.
[00:29:00] And if you're interested in it,
[00:29:02] there's a lot of good CPAs,
[00:29:03] I specialize in this, talk to your agent,
[00:29:05] if they're familiar with it, talk to a lender,
[00:29:08] if you're looking to finance this strategy, right?
[00:29:10] But it's, I would have to say,
[00:29:12] especially with bonus appreciation being back
[00:29:15] in this bill,
[00:29:17] it is probably the most powerful investment tool
[00:29:19] available to an American citizen.
[00:29:22] And I don't really think it's close.
[00:29:25] Any coincidence that Trump as a real estate developer,
[00:29:29] I don't know if he specifically pushed for this,
[00:29:32] or just curious if that's connected to the fact that,
[00:29:36] he was a leverage guy.
[00:29:38] So he probably employed the strategy a lot
[00:29:40] with his own investments.
[00:29:42] 100% yeah, when you hear Trump
[00:29:44] or another big one is Robert Kiyosaki,
[00:29:47] right, they're dead poor dead.
[00:29:48] When you hear them say, I don't pay taxes
[00:29:50] because I'm smart.
[00:29:51] Yeah, they're not smart.
[00:29:53] They're just depreciating real estate.
[00:29:55] Like, I'm not saying they're not smart.
[00:29:56] I'm just saying like, they don't have some secret, right?
[00:29:59] It's they're depreciating real estate
[00:30:00] and they're writing that off against their other income.
[00:30:03] That's how they pay no taxes.
[00:30:04] It's how everybody that you've ever heard pays no taxes,
[00:30:07] pays no taxes.
[00:30:08] Right.
[00:30:09] Yeah, it's really about the only way you can do it.
[00:30:11] It's about the only way, unless you have a business
[00:30:13] that has some fake taxes.
[00:30:14] A lot of losses.
[00:30:15] Right off everything.
[00:30:16] The true way to not actually lose money
[00:30:20] and save on taxes is depreciation.
[00:30:23] Right.
[00:30:25] Awesome.
[00:30:26] Well, look, I think we went over a lot today.
[00:30:28] I want to talk in next time about syndication deals.
[00:30:33] That's another interesting way where people park money.
[00:30:36] They can take advantage of some of the depreciation benefits
[00:30:40] and let somebody else handle all the management side of it.
[00:30:44] I'm curious to get your thoughts on it
[00:30:45] because I know you probably have very strong opinions
[00:30:47] about syndication deals.
[00:30:48] These are where basically you put pool of money together.
[00:30:51] Somebody else manages, you know,
[00:30:53] could be a commercial sort of, you know,
[00:30:55] a series of parcels and you get some additional tax benefits
[00:31:00] and then usually get your money back after a certain amount
[00:31:02] of time with an interest payment every month.
[00:31:05] And so I'll be curious.
[00:31:06] I want to get your thoughts on versus trying doing it yourself
[00:31:09] and buying properties yourself versus syndication
[00:31:12] where it's kind of like sitting for a certain forget.
[00:31:15] From a tax perspective, I'm curious to hear what your opinion
[00:31:19] was.
[00:31:19] I mean, partnerships, indications definitely have their place.
[00:31:23] It probably allows you to expand your capital a little bit more.
[00:31:26] Right, especially if you partner with somebody
[00:31:27] where I'll do the work and you provide the down payment, right?
[00:31:32] Obviously, I'm always going to say be careful
[00:31:34] of who you partner with, you know,
[00:31:36] because that there could always be the unspoken
[00:31:38] that come along with that.
[00:31:40] But it could definitely be the right fit for the right people,
[00:31:43] right, especially if you have a good relationship
[00:31:45] with whoever it is.
[00:31:49] Could be a fit, just be careful.
[00:31:51] The indications I've seen get people in a lot of trouble.
[00:31:53] I've seen them be very successful as well.
[00:31:56] So it's a big problem.
[00:31:57] 
[00:31:57] Well, we can chat about that next time.
[00:31:59] Again, everybody, for anyone listening right now,
[00:32:03] I want you to reach out to Christian and his team

Now as a real estate recruiter, I can tell you the answer is always yes. But most agents aren't looking to move right now. So how do you know who to contact? Well, what if I were to tell you there's a recruiting and retention tool powered by artificial intelligence that shows you exactly which agents in your local market are looking to leave their brokerage right now and which agents at your own firm are also looking to leave you. Now I've been recruiting REALTORS for 15 years and I've hired over 2000 agents. I can tell you with no exaggeration, this is the tool I've been waiting for. Corded's AI looks for trends across dozens of variables for each agent in your market and shows you which agents they believe are likely to move. Not only does it do that, but corded's AI went and visited my recruiting website and read everything I offer. So now when I'm recruiting, corded's AI tells me exactly what to say based on that agent's needs and what my brokerage can offer. It even writes emails for me. I've never seen anything like it and I use it every single day. Now if you are looking to grow your brokerage, corded.io is the best tool out there. Visit corded.io to schedule a demo again. That's corded.io and now onto the show. I'm your guide and host through the show today is our monthly series called Learn with a Lender with Christian Batchelder. I want to tell you more about Christian if you're new to our show. By the way, even if you are new to our show, if you are familiar with bigger pockets, you'll know Christian for sure. He and his partner David Green, we're gonna give you a little bit of background on Christian right now. But together with David Green, Christian co-founded the one brokerage, which was deemed the fastest growing broker in the nation in 2021 and 2022, also ranked in the top 20 brokerages by funded loan volume. Christian is a UC Berkeley grad. He has a bachelor's in chemical engineering, but he hated the industry. And wanted to get out of a capped earning potential. So he got into real estate with the help of a childhood family friend who had some success in the business and discovered that Christian had a knack for connecting with people and adding value to their mindsets, also their investments as well as their journey. He's a licensed real estate agent, insurance and mortgage broker. He regularly hosts masterminds seminars and webinars with real estate gurus. He teaches people everything from investing principles on how to buy your thousandth property with a focus on what markets to target, how to find the best loans, and how to protect ones investments with insurance policies and other forms of asset protection. Christian himself has purchased 15 properties in the last 12 months. We're employing the exact same principles that he's teaching us on this podcast. He created a course for loan officers to enroll to teach the fundamentals of the sales process, how to become the best advisor possible, how to get the most out of this career path and tips on succeeding in any market. I want everybody to give Christian and his team an opportunity on your next loan, your next client loan, go to v1brokeridge.com and one is the number one. So v1brokeridge.com or find Christian online. He is everywhere and he is often sought after by lots of organizations to speak specifically about the state of the market. He's gonna do that today. And Christian, welcome back to the show. Absolutely, I appreciate you having me. Looking forward to this one. Yeah, I am such a big fan of you and David and what you, I tell you, you guys' name comes up all the time when I talk to anyone who's an agent, who's an investor who obviously knows bigger pockets. Like they all know you. And so it's just, it's a lot of fun to have you here. And I've had David on the show before many years ago and that was a great episode as well. But let's, yeah, let's talk. So we got a question from the audience that I thought was a particularly good one and you had a really unique take on it. We were talking just a few minutes ago, but the question was to the, I'm paraphrasing. But it was, hey, I'm an agent and I have a lot of my sellers or my owners or Heather who would like to sell but don't want to give up that 3% rate. They know they want or need to move in the next few years, but they're just not quite ready to give up. I mean, I'm in that boat. I certainly understand that pain point. I'm going to be moving in the next probably year. I'm gonna be giving up that rate, but that's a voluntary thing for me because it's better for me to do that now when there's less competition. So there's some, maybe some logic there possibly. But certainly it's a painful thing. So I guess the question is what would you, or the question being what would you say to a REALTOR who says, hey, I've got these clients, they want to move in the near term, but they don't want to give up the rate. Yeah, I mean, my mind immediately goes to a couple options. I mean, the first one is the client, you know, you have to understand that your client has a point, right? That's the thing is agents get into this idea that you have to sell, you know, you learn one thing to sell and you have to sell it, you know, square peg into a round hole so to speak, right? Like, you have to sell it all the time. And it's possible. I mean, obviously that client needs to move, you know, it's possible you should hear them out, right? I mean, as a, absolutely, if you had a 3% rate, I wouldn't want to lose it either, right? I don't have any 3% rates. I refinance that of all of mine. So I'm kind of the living proof of how to, you know, scale even through the pain points of losing good rates. But in reality, there are options that you can just talk through with your client to make sure that they understand kind of the whole, you know, the whole process, right? The first one being the equity in that property isn't locked. What I mean by that is, let's say you're living in, you know, a single family, you bought it in 2020 for 500K, it's worth 600 now, you know, and you, oh, you've paid down your mortgage a bit. Let's say you owe 400,000 on it, right? Part of that equity you can tap and do. You can do things like a HELOC, you can do what we kind of in the industry call a HELOAN, which is basically just a fancy word for a second mortgage. And that allows you to protect the interest rate, right? Protect your third, you're 3%, you're 4%, maybe you're 2%, right? Depending on when you got it. And still access some of the equity in that property. Now, there are limitations of the program, you have to qualify and all that. But all of that aside, the fundamental idea that most people believe, hey, I have a 3% rate, but I have all this equity in this property. I talked to a guy today who's got almost a $2 million single family property in the Bay Area, and he owes 300,000 on it. He's like, I can't refi. Right. Why not? He's like, well, I have a 3% rate, I won't lose that. No matter what your pitch is to me, I won't lose that. I said, cool, let's do a HELOC and he said, what's that? And I'm like, well, what if I can put like 500 K in your pocket? He's like, I'd love that, but I'm not giving up my 3% rate. I said, you don't have to, brother, it's fine. Don't worry about it, right? And there are options there. Now, we obviously don't want to over leverage properties. I'm not the lender that just sells loans by any term. By any means necessary, right? Just like I don't believe real-idors should sell listing properties by any means necessary. But our job as advisors and guides, so to speak, in the financial industry, is to give people options. It's not to make decisions for them, right? If people understand what's in front of them, they understand, hey, I can go get some equity. Obviously, that HELOC will have a payment, right? So we don't want to over leverage, we don't want to push it into the non- whether it's a parental property and you're not cash flowing, or if it's a primary and you're pushing above your comfort threshold. It is an option, right? And my classic kind of work around to people in this position is, we'll keep that property at a two and a half or 3% rate. The chances are probably pretty high that you would cash flow. Because your mortgage payment is so low compared to what more likely to not rental income is for that property. In most markets, maybe there's some markets where people are going to point at me and say, you're wrong, my house won't cover the mortgage. Okay, but most markets, if you have a two and a half percent rate and you rent that bad boy out, it's going to cash flow. Right? I would hope so. So somebody sitting on a $500,000 mortgage, maybe we go put a $100,000 key lock on it. And now you're borrowing 600 total from that property. You have the $100,000 for your new down payment, right? And that can be purchasing a new 10% down on a million dollar property, whatever you want to do with it, right? But the average weight of that large first mortgage, 500K in this example, being at such a low rate, you don't have to sell that to move. If you just moved out and converted it to a rental, now I know not everybody wants to be a landlord fair, but just strictly speaking from like the best financial advice I could give, being a landlord is worth saving your 2% rate. 100, yes, 100%. It just is. And you know, you hear a horror story, so what if my tenants don't pay and all the nightmares that can happen? Sure, there's ways to mitigate that with good property management and due diligence on your tenants for sure. But keeping a property where you're basically borrowing money for free. Yeah. Now that sounds weird, but hear me out. If that money, 500 gram, is sitting in a bank account, it's losing money. People don't see it that way because the dollar amount doesn't go down, but it is because inflation exists. Right. So every year, unless you say we're being very lenient and say inflation's 3%, it's not, but let's just pretend. Right. The price that was only 3%. Yeah, let's just pretend like the CPI is accurate. Right. And I'm using term CPI is the consumer price index. That's basically how the federal government monitors inflation, but it's a very flawed tool. They basically nitpick, which, you know, they cherry pick which ones actually go into the bucket. But if your money sitting in your bank account is losing 3% in our example per year, and you have a 2.5% rate, you're borrowing other people's money for less return than their money is losing. That bank is really losing giving you a 2.5% rate. Now, we're not in the business of making sure banks succeed. So you should take advantage of that. If that's you, right? Like who cares if your bank's making money? Trust me, they're doing fine. Right. But if you're in a position where you're borrowing less than inflation, if inflation is 3% and you're at 2.5%, even if you're at 3%, even if you're par with inflation, you're basically still borrowing money for free. So my point there being, if you can convert that property, still realize all the benefits of real estate ownership, still realize appreciation, principal paydown, a lot of people forget appreciation of rent, right? Even though you may be able to rent it for three grand this month, what if it's 3,200 next year, 3,500 year after that? Like go back and look what people are paying for rent in the early 2000s. Right. It's not what it is now. And people forget about that aspect of real estate investing is that they just look at their property appraising, and they forget about their rent appraising, right? And even though most people, especially if a REALTOR is pitching them like sell this house by a new one, you should really consider the possibility of them keeping that house, solving both problems of allowing them to hold onto the good interest rate, utilizing a heat lock to tap into the equity, buy a new house, and yes, at market rates that they are today, but as DJs let off with, there's gonna be much less competition right now. So your opportunity to get a price at a lower purchase price is so significantly more than it was during COVID. And all those people with 2% rates, they paid a hundred- They overpaid. 300 grand more than it was worth it at the time, right? Yep. And it was validated at that time, because it's worth it, because your rate's so low, and there's a case to be made there. But it kind of locks you in long term, which a lot of these people, you know, we call it the golden handcuffs in the industry, right? Where you just feel like you can't get out. And this is a good middle ground workaround solution, right? That allows you to keep the benefit while still not completely eliminating your ability to buy new property as well. And potentially, you know, divorces, new kids, people have to buy regardless of your rate sometimes. And if they're in that position, talk about this. It's a good conversation to have as an agent. And if you're not having these conversations with your LO, with your lender, call Christian and his team. They will work with this out with you, and they will talk to your clients. They're awesome. The other idea too, and this is probably, you know, a more controversial thought, but it's certainly you could make a case for it, is if you can't convert that, if you can't turn it into a rental property, like I have a condo, there's, you know, rules around it, I probably just won't be able to do that as much, as I would love to never have to sell that property, no matter what, even though I won't be living it in any year, I would love to not sell it. But I probably will have to. But if I do, the worst, it wouldn't be the worst idea to sell it and rent for a year, and just take my winnings off the table, right? That's another, it's another not terrible idea that people don't typically like to go from ownership back to rental, like I get it, there's a psychological sort of hurdle there, but if you're gonna, like my place is appreciated quite a bit in the last four years, and you know, I don't know if I can't find something to buy, it still might make sense to sell and take my winnings off the table, like. Yeah, absolutely. And speaking of from somebody who rents where they live, and purchase his investment properties, I don't own my primary, which sounds funny. But I don't because I choose to instead invest my capital into cashling real estate, right? I'm a huge component of real estate, from myself personally, I'm not a huge component of owning where I live because I view that as a net loss because I can rent for cheaper, right? Right, I always think too, it's funny when we think about our primary residence as an asset. I'm like, it's not really an asset until the day you sell it, that it's an asset because you see actual money. Other than that, it is a money pit, that is what it is, and there's value in owning a property. There's value there, but it is not, I don't think, and I'm sure you could argue probably both sides of this, but to see it as an asset is, and I just gave myself a thumbs up for watching that was accidental. That did not mean to do that, it's Apple stuff. But anyway, you could argue it's not an asset because it costs money and it's not generating income. Yeah, and there's some exceptions with like house hackers or fee buyables and family, but that's not the battle in the 40 of people. Totally. And there's still something to be said, you are still building equity over the long term. A lot of people use their home as their retirement subsidy, right? I mean, that's, there's absolutely a justification, and then just quality of life, right? I mean, you own your own place, you can do the renovations you want. I get both sides just, it's more of a personal preference. I don't have kids, I'm not in a position where I need a bunch of space. So if you're in that position, obviously, make the right decision for you, right? And that's something that you should be talking to your agent about or talking to your lender about what you call black war, right? For sure. And again, I love the fact that you own a ridiculous number of properties. And yet your primary is like, I'll just rent and I'll move when I want and I'll go where I want. And that still makes the most sense in your situation. And because you are taking the capital, you would be putting that for a down payment and you are actually putting that money to work for you. So you're actually using that money to make money. And the rent I imagine is almost negligible. I'm guessing it's almost like, it's fine because everything else is. Like I'm here to a mortgage in my area, I live in Southern California. It's significantly different, right? I mean, my monthly payment to buy a house that I'd want to live in probably three to four times what my rent is, right? Amazing. So I'm saving quite a bit. And once again, that's a personal decision. That's not something that I'm repising everybody to do. You know, if you've got two, three kids and a dog and you need a backyard and all the amenities, I get it. But it's just something to think about, you know, especially somebody who, you know, fresh out of college or something, you know, get your feet under you, you know, get your investing started. And it's possible to invest early, right? There are markets where you can invest with very small down payments. And I love you, you have a lot of great sort of retirement ideas around investing in real estate. You talked about your primary being a possible vehicle for a lot of people for their retirement. And you can actually be a lot more efficient and effective by taking money out and, you know, buying properties year over year. And you do that. You guys do that and you are big proponents of it. And that is your retirement plan. And I love that you're doing that. And so, for example, my point with saying this and you can go back to previous episodes or just reach out to Christian and his team, they will explain to you some of these philosophies that are truly creative and are amazingly effective, which is why Christian's such a great asset to our show. But if you're not familiar with these, you almost owe it to your clients as a REALTOR. You owe it to your clients to at least have a general awareness of what this is, how this could work. And just knowing this alone will help differentiate you for most other agents. So, whether or not somebody decides to buy a property every year, which Christian and his team can show them guys how to do that, it's still a cool thing to bring to a client and say, have you thought about doing this? And it's a really cool thing to do yourself. Because what will happen is, as you start investing, you're gonna attract other investors. Other people are going to notice what you're doing and you are going to them being able to say, oh, I can show you how to do this. And now all of a sudden you've built in business for yourself. 100%. Yeah, I mean, the best agents, I wouldn't say the best, but very good agents typically tend towards investing themselves, right? It's always make a joke. You know, if you walk into a BMW dealership and your salesman is driving Mercedes, right? What are you doing? You're going to Mercedes. Yeah, what are we doing? Like, you know, if you believe in the car and you're selling to other people, like you should probably be driving one, right? I'm using an employee discount or whatever you got, right? Right. And it's a significant discount as a REALTOR. You're saving 2.5% or whatever, you know, whatever your brokerage allows you to do. But I mean, at our brokerage, you know, you could just roll the whole thing in and that's a huge, yeah, use that discount. So reach out to Christian and his team if you have not explored this option for yourself or for your clients. This is a great phone call to have with everyone that's a homeowner, especially people who have bought in the last seven years. Their home value is appreciated in most cases. This, you want to at least give them an updated estimate and say, hey, I was looking at your zestimate online. I think it's actually a little inaccurate. I'm going to rerun it for you and show you what I think it's really worth. And I got a creative idea for you, whether or not you want to do it up to you, but I just thought I'd throw it your way. People are going to be so impressed. All right, let's also do a quick state of the market. I know rates have kind of been jumping around a bit in the last week or so. They were in the sevens. Now they're I think in the high sixes. And again, we don't really care so much about where rates are today, but what is going on currently with rates? Nobody has a crystal ball, but what are you sort of thinking about the future of rates right now? Yeah, we're in a, I feel like the biggest term you've heard the last few years is unprecedented from COVID, everything that's happened since then. But financially speaking, we're in a very interesting time. Obviously we have kind of done a lot of tariffs happening. And whether that's a positive or negative impact long term is yet to be seen. But you know, the markets are responding accordingly, right? The original thought was that tariffs would directly lead to inflation, right? They would directly lead to increased cost of goods, which at least in the short term here, we haven't really seen. Not yet. Echro scale yet. Now to be fair, a lot of the tariffs have been paused and they're just now starting to get implemented. So that may be kind of a deferred symptom of that, so to speak. But we'll see, right? If they do prove to be inflationary, that will typically lead towards higher rates because we need to combat that inflation back down and the way the Fed has historically done that is by pulling the rate lever, right? And just so everybody understands, why do you drop rates or increase rates to kind of stay in line with inflation? The general idea just kind of breaking it down and kind of layman's terms, if inflation is high, that means the price of goods are like out of control, right? Inflation is going crazy, that means, but people are still buying typically, right? When you increase rates, you retract demand because there's less like volatility of money through the market. There's less loans being given, there's less things being given to small businesses that play their staff, it's kind of a trickle down effect, right? When rates go up, it basically constricts the economy. It's not a good thing. We don't like increasing rates, but you have to close everything down. Yeah, it's a slowing down basically. We don't like doing it, but you have to because the alternative is run away inflation and nobody wants to see, $49 eggs, right? So that's what the Fed will typically do to kind of stifle inflation. Where we're at right now is the Fed believes inflation to be coming through tariffs, but it's not seen yet. So the argument is we're going to keep rates high as a precursor to stifling that inflation that may come. The counter argument is there's no inflation yet. So why are we keeping rates high, right? So the argument is why don't we drop rates for now and if inflation comes, we raise rates in the future. That's when you hear Trump calling Jerome Powell like a doofus and you know, a two late pal and all the things he likes to throw out, right? That's what he's referencing is sure, let's drop rates and fine, if my tariffs leads inflation will handle it at them. And Jerome Powell's kind of dig in his feed in. I think depending on if this kind of maintains par for the course, I do think rates in the long term the one, two, kind of three year range are scheduled to come down. I think it's impossible for them not to. We owe so much money, so you guys understand that the rate that is set on like the prime rate by the Fed, that dictates the amount of interest that America has to pay to their bond holders, which a lot of them are other countries. So if we drop those rates, we drop the interest payments we make and it actually saves America as a country a lot of money, which I think that that'll eventually just kind of crack the decision it just has to, right? There's too much money on the table. Like I think if we drop by 1% America saves like, it's some looting, it's like $900 billion or something crazy in interest payments, it's like an unfathomable amount of money, right? But that's that. The big thing obviously we just had the big beautiful bill affectionately called, right? That did have a number of impacts specifically on real estate and investors particularly, and I wanna make sure I don't let this episode go by with at least addressing it briefly. The biggest thing by far for real estate specifically is the return of 100% bonus depreciation. That came back with the big beautiful bill. And what that means depreciation is a hard concept to grasp and let me see if I can explain it as well as I can. When you buy a property or really in that manner, any asset, a car, a boat, a plane, anything, every year that you own that piece of asset, whatever it is, it gets less and less valuable. That's the idea of depreciation when something depreciates, it's wearing away, right? Well, the American tax code has an ability for you to write off the loss that that asset is generating every year. Now, it's not like a lot of people think, oh, I'm writing it off, so like, I have to go pay the depreciation man. It's not a real expense, it's a paper expense. It's just saying that this asset that I buy is less and less every year because it's older. It costs more to upkeep, things break. You know, if it's a home, your HVAC goes down or your roof starts to wear away, if it's a plane, you gotta repair the tires, the car, the tires, all these things. It just takes more to the expense, right? And what bonus depreciation is, is it's a tool for investors to front load their depreciation. What I mean by that is instead of taking that yearly take, like, oh, my house is worth 10 grand less than 10 grand and 10 grand, that's the calculation of how much it's worn away. Instead, it allows you to take it all in the first year. Yeah. The reason why that's powerful, I'll explain the most common reason is to people who use this. Let's say you have a husband and wife, the husband is a doctor, right? High income W. Turner, a doctor, lawyer, and attorney, something, right? And they pay a lot of income tax. Let's say our doctor makes 400K a year and he's in California, so he's probably paying close to 200K in taxes between the state and federal. It's a lot of money. What the argument is, is out of that 400, he's paying 50%, he pays $200,000 in income tax. Instead, if he took that $200,000 and went and made a down payment on a million dollar property, that's 20% down on a million dollars. If he costs segregated, which is the study that it's called, but really, it allows you to take this depreciation in year one, he may get a $200,000 tax write-off from that property to give you an idea of what these numbers could be. I bought what a $1.6 million property a couple years back and I got about a $600,000 write-off for it. So it's not like small number, it's significant. And what that does is you take that write-off and it's only for one year. So the argument against depreciation is, oh, what about the next year's and sure, but hear me out? You get to take that $400,000 write-off, what's that? And that completely wipes out his income. Now what's his taxable income? He has a $400,000 earnings from his W2, and he has a $400,000 write-off from that property he bought. In IRS's view, you made $0, which guess what your tax rate is on $0? Yeah. Big fat donut, right? So basically what he did is he pivoted the $200,000 that he would have had to pay him taxes anyways, and instead he bought a property with him. And now you have cash flow potentially, even if you don't have cash flow, you save 200 grand of taxes. It's still a big win. But ideally you have cash flow, you have appreciation of that property, you have somebody paying down your mortgage. It's a huge win, right? And the argument is next year, you do it again, instead of paying taxes, you buy a house, right? And you get into this process of, it goes along with the other concept of buying one house a year where you pay a house with your income tax, right? This is an amazing opportunity for people to buy a property every year, essentially. Especially high W2 income earners that have a spouse at home who doesn't work, because that spouse at home can take all of those deductions, and if you guys file jointly, which 90% of couples do, right? Her loss can count directly against his income, right? And it's a household income, you get taxes of married couple, right? Very, very, very powerful strategy. I'm leaving some details out, because there are some requirements that you have to do to actually qualify for bonus appreciation, but without getting two into the weeds, I think it's a lot of minutia, but it is possible. And if you're interested in it, there's a lot of good CPAs, I specialize in this, talk to your agent, if they're familiar with it, talk to a lender, if you're looking to finance this strategy, right? But it's, I would have to say, especially with bonus appreciation being back in this bill, it is probably the most powerful investment tool available to an American citizen. And I don't really think it's close. Any coincidence that Trump as a real estate developer, I don't know if he specifically pushed for this, or just curious if that's connected to the fact that, he was a leverage guy. So he probably employed the strategy a lot with his own investments. 100% yeah, when you hear Trump or another big one is Robert Kiyosaki, right, they're dead poor dead. When you hear them say, I don't pay taxes because I'm smart. Yeah, they're not smart. They're just depreciating real estate. Like, I'm not saying they're not smart. I'm just saying like, they don't have some secret, right? It's they're depreciating real estate and they're writing that off against their other income. That's how they pay no taxes. It's how everybody that you've ever heard pays no taxes, pays no taxes. Right. Yeah, it's really about the only way you can do it. It's about the only way, unless you have a business that has some fake taxes. A lot of losses. Right off everything. The true way to not actually lose money and save on taxes is depreciation. Right. Awesome. Well, look, I think we went over a lot today. I want to talk in next time about syndication deals. That's another interesting way where people park money. They can take advantage of some of the depreciation benefits and let somebody else handle all the management side of it. I'm curious to get your thoughts on it because I know you probably have very strong opinions about syndication deals. These are where basically you put pool of money together. Somebody else manages, you know, could be a commercial sort of, you know, a series of parcels and you get some additional tax benefits and then usually get your money back after a certain amount of time with an interest payment every month. And so I'll be curious. I want to get your thoughts on versus trying doing it yourself and buying properties yourself versus syndication where it's kind of like sitting for a certain forget. From a tax perspective, I'm curious to hear what your opinion was. I mean, partnerships, indications definitely have their place. It probably allows you to expand your capital a little bit more. Right, especially if you partner with somebody where I'll do the work and you provide the down payment, right? Obviously, I'm always going to say be careful of who you partner with, you know, because that there could always be the unspoken that come along with that. But it could definitely be the right fit for the right people, right, especially if you have a good relationship with whoever it is. Could be a fit, just be careful. The indications I've seen get people in a lot of trouble. I've seen them be very successful as well. So it's a big problem. Well, we can chat about that next time.
