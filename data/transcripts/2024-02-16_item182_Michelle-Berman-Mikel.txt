[00:05:12] which is Burman media social B-E-R-M-A-N Burman media social link to that as well in the show notes.
[00:05:19] Michelle, welcome to the show. Thanks so much for having me. I'm so excited to be here.
[00:05:23] I'm so excited. I'm so excited to have you. We rarely ever talk about Instagram and I
[00:05:29] am not particularly skilled at Instagram myself. So I am excited to learn along with our audience.
[00:05:36] But tell me more about you. How did you get involved in social?
[00:05:40] Yeah, this is my absolute favorite story to tell. So thanks for starting with that question for
[00:05:45] sure, but I actually got into the Instagram space way back in 2014. So when that started at that
[00:05:54] time of my life, Instagram was much more about sort of the influencer space, right? In the sense of,
[00:06:01] you know, not necessarily holding a pretty hot product and getting paid to do it. But more so,
[00:06:06] I was the broker between the large brands and the Instagram accounts that we were placing
[00:06:11] content on or buying ad space on. So really what happened was I was sort of in the middle of
[00:06:17] these huge brands trying to promote product, trying to drive website clicks and trying to drive
[00:06:23] views. And honestly, at that point, buying things off Instagram wasn't really a thing yet.
[00:06:28] You had to go to a website. So I was in between the brand and in between the accounts themselves. So
[00:06:34] in that process, I personally purchased several large Instagram accounts to do this on my own.
[00:06:40] So I was selling ad space of my own. I was working with the brands to create all the ads,
[00:06:45] writing all the copy, deciding on which pages to put their content on to hopefully drive sales.
[00:06:51] And what I learned in the process was really, really quickly, how to see through the crap,
[00:06:57] right? I hope I can say that that way. But fake views, fake likes, fake everything. That's on the
[00:07:02] platform, right? Because it was my job to sniff it out because if a company was paying me a large
[00:07:08] sum of money to help them produce more money. And we put, we chose that Instagram page to put
[00:07:14] their ad on and it didn't produce anything. The metal ultimately fell back on me. So in the process,
[00:07:19] I just had to really be able to sniff that stuff out. So with that being said, I got very good at
[00:07:25] understanding what worked, what didn't work, what kind of content was going to resonate with an
[00:07:30] audience and what wasn't, what kind of copy was going to actually get someone to take action.
[00:07:35] So long story short, I face planted into the art of human psychology and sales psychology and have
[00:07:41] those two worlds merge fast forward to today. I run a very large Instagram prospecting company.
[00:07:50] So we specialize in teaching real estate agents and loan officers how to actually actively prospect
[00:07:55] on Instagram versus what a lot of us know as passive prospecting, right? Which is traditionally
[00:08:01] what Instagram has been, which is sort of this platform of just post content, make good videos,
[00:08:07] write good captions, make sure you show up in your stories consistently, but then you just sort of
[00:08:12] sit and wait for inbound messages. So you're sort of living in this reactive space. And I have
[00:08:19] spent the better part of, you know, close to five years since launching beyond the method.
[00:08:24] Trying to flip that upside down and showing people that Instagram is not just a placeholder for
[00:08:29] great content. It's a platform that can actually replace a lot of the outbound prospecting that you
[00:08:35] have to do or that real estate agents tend to do in the form of like cold calling and all kinds of
[00:08:40] other things. So that's the the fast way to go from 2014 to today.
[00:08:47] This is really I'm really excited to dive into this because I, I really only know to look at
[00:08:54] Instagram from a research and development perspective from an agent. So an agent can follow all
[00:09:00] of their clients and their prospects and learn about their lives and then use that as reasoning to
[00:09:05] reach out. Hey, I saw you on an vacation. I saw the picture of that fancy dinner you made.
[00:09:11] So that's and that is not about posting content. And so I'm really excited to learn more about sort of
[00:09:16] best practices with content and also relationship building. But the only thing I know to do with
[00:09:22] Instagram is be like, Oh, I saw somebody did this and maybe I could reach out and develop, you know,
[00:09:25] a stronger relationship that way. But there's so much more, of course, to developing a content
[00:09:31] calendar, really thinking about what kind of content somebody can, somebody can produce and promote
[00:09:36] that actually drives business in a way that's authentic and and not salesy. So yeah, let's talk
[00:09:43] about it. Well, maybe the first thing to talk about is what do REALTORS get wrong about their own
[00:09:50] Instagram accounts? Like what are they doing that you just go, gosh, if I could wave a magic
[00:09:56] wand and tell them all not to do this, what are they doing that you wish they'd just. Oh my god,
[00:10:00] how much time do we have DJ? All the time. There's a handful of them and I'm going to do my best to
[00:10:08] keep it Twitter-align as far as how I would describe this. But there's really two big ones that
[00:10:14] jump out at me as someone who spends all day, every day consuming real estate agents content on
[00:10:20] Instagram. First and foremost is their leveraging boilerplate templates, right? So what that means is
[00:10:25] that they're using services that are producing the same type of content for every person that's
[00:10:30] using the service. And the problem with that is for you as the real estate agent, right? You're like,
[00:10:36] yes, this is easy, it's cheap, cool. Now I don't have to worry about it. I checked my social media
[00:10:40] box. But the problem is that there's no person there. There's no brand built into that. There's
[00:10:47] definitely no like who is Michelle or who is DJ involved in that content. And the problem with
[00:10:53] that for me as a consumer is I'm not hiring you as a real estate agent because your content says that
[00:11:00] you're the top 1% in your area. I'm hiring you because I like you as a human. There's something
[00:11:06] psychologically that's connecting us, right? Oh, you're in the CrossFit too. So am I. My husband
[00:11:11] runs ultra marathon's weight. So it is mine. Right now we're building this like very intentional and
[00:11:16] very authentic relationship. And then you as the real estate agent, I hire you as the vehicle to get
[00:11:22] me from I want to buy a house, but I'm to I now own a house, but I'm choosing you because I like
[00:11:28] you and then you just become the mechanism to get me there, right? And so I think real estate agents
[00:11:32] think that Instagram is a place for them to show off. And it's sort of overproduced and it's like
[00:11:39] this big giant production of content. And I have had in my almost 10 years, I've probably had a
[00:11:46] videographer follow me around like maybe three or four times on one hand, right? So 95% of the content
[00:11:53] that I produce on a daily basis is from my phone. That's it, right? So. So we're so if I
[00:12:01] understand you correctly, we're talking about, for example, the kinds of boilerplate content that
[00:12:06] REALTORS often will fall back on is closed, closed sale or I just won this award or I just got,
[00:12:13] you know, I'm in the top as you said 1%. I just again, it's it's achievement. Here are all my
[00:12:19] achievements or and you're right. That doesn't really speak to what I mean anyone other than your
[00:12:26] parents might want to see or your maybe your best friends. But boilerplate, boilerplate content
[00:12:32] also second to your point there DJ because yes, absolutely. But the second part to boilerplate content
[00:12:38] is if you've ever seen those sort of stock images that go out right where if you're if you're
[00:12:44] paying, you know, 150 bucks a month and it posts on your behalf and all it does is slap your photo
[00:12:49] on it. But it's the background is a kitchen that's not of one of your listings or it's not like
[00:12:54] that type of stuff, right? It's very unauthentic. It's definitely not organic content. And it's usually
[00:13:02] with rinse wash repeat, right? So I have a friend that I'm talking to on Instagram right now and he
[00:13:09] recommended another person to me and he's like, Hey, you got to go look at this guy's Instagram and
[00:13:13] then you got a yell at him because I know him. So tell him I told you to yell at him. And I was like,
[00:13:17] what are you talking about? And I pulled up his Instagram and every single piece of content was one
[00:13:23] of these stock templates and the only personal photo on the entire account with over 200 posts was his
[00:13:30] profile photo. That's it. So that's the problem, right? Is like if I click on this gentleman's
[00:13:35] account, I'm like, who is this dude? Right? It's just business, business, business, business or
[00:13:40] a cool template. So should should we think about Instagram as yes a way to demonstrate what we know
[00:13:48] and and maybe some of our achievements, I certainly feel there's a place for that. But most
[00:13:53] importantly, would you define Instagram as a way for people to get to know me or the agent as an
[00:14:01] actual individual both professionally and whatever degree of personal somebody wants to expose?
[00:14:07] Absolutely. One million percent. And there's certainly a great point there that you just mentioned
[00:14:12] that I don't want to skip over, which is, you know, how personal are you willing to get? You know,
[00:14:16] I have a private coaching client who he is not comfortable posting his children on Instagram.
[00:14:21] I have no problem with that, right? I have a two and a half year old. So any of you guys who see
[00:14:25] my Instagram, you'll see him. He's the best thing ever. But I love talking about him. I love
[00:14:30] posting about him. But not everybody is that comfortable, right? When you when you have things like
[00:14:36] hunting or shooting, right? Like my husband is a medically retired green beret. So we shoot a lot.
[00:14:41] Like we have we have we own several guns and in our home. And for me, that's just part of who I am.
[00:14:48] But that's not going to go on my Instagram, right? Like maybe a video of my husband and I going to
[00:14:53] the range for like a date night, but I'm not going to be posting other content related to the gun
[00:14:58] piece, right? And is the reasoning for that? That is the reason for not posting gun content because
[00:15:07] you feel that's a barely polarizing topic or yeah, but at the same time, I'm not going to diminish
[00:15:13] who my husband was and the fact that he served our or served our country and is an incredible
[00:15:19] shooter. Like and we have a lot of fun going and doing it. But it's also like another big one is
[00:15:25] the religion piece, right? Like can we use can we use that in our content? Yes and no, right? But I
[00:15:31] have clients who, for example, they'll say like Michelle, we love hunting. So how can we post about
[00:15:35] hunting without it being this polarizing thing? And what I always say is maybe we don't post the dead
[00:15:41] animal, but maybe we just post pictures in front of our car in our camel, right? Like getting ready
[00:15:46] to go. So there is certainly a way to be able to talk about anything and everything that you want
[00:15:51] to talk about in a way that is designed to be comfortable and consumable. But Instagram as a
[00:15:58] platform as as a whole is designed to be a place where someone gets to know me as a human and gets
[00:16:03] to see how credible of a XYZ I am, right? In this case, we're talking about real estate agents. So I
[00:16:10] don't care as a consumer if I'm your first house you've ever sold or your hundredth house you've
[00:16:16] ever sold. Because if I don't like you, I'm still not going to hire you. Even if everyone is
[00:16:21] saying you're the number one person. So that's where the active prospecting piece of what I teach
[00:16:26] specifically comes in because in order for me to determine as a consumer that you're the real estate
[00:16:32] agent that I want to hire, there's some some sort of qualifications, if you will, that are going to
[00:16:38] make me feel the need or sort of the urge, if you will, to reach out to somebody via social.
[00:16:46] That makes sense. I'd like to ask a few other questions that are coming to mind that
[00:16:52] REALTORS often ask me about social and I'm not an expert at all. But one of the questions and I know
[00:16:58] this isn't an easy quick answer. But how often to how often to post, right? And we'll start with
[00:17:05] how often to post. So I know this is part of your program. And by the way, we should really
[00:17:10] be plugging Michelle's program because she goes through this in step by step details. But beyond
[00:17:15] the method, it's been around for five plus years. She updates it all the time and you can find that
[00:17:19] at BermanMediaPD.com and we'll have a link to that. But as far as sometimes agents are like,
[00:17:26] gosh, I don't have all this time. So what what is your first sort of answer or response to somebody
[00:17:33] going, how much how much time is this going to take and how how many posts should I be doing?
[00:17:37] It's such a big question and it's so loaded. What I what we do for our clients, we have a 30-day
[00:17:43] calendar, right? So we post 30 days out of the month for me personally. If you consume my content,
[00:17:49] I post once every two or three days on my grid and I am in stories constantly. So stories is for
[00:17:58] me personally as someone who's you know on zoom, I don't even know how many times a day, way too
[00:18:02] many hours, my end of hour monthly zoom report would be really bad. You know, like your phone tells
[00:18:09] you like your screen time report, it's up 60% or whatever. I would be worried or nervous to see my
[00:18:15] zoom one. But so for me, my focus and my emphasis is on my stories consistently every single day.
[00:18:21] And then my feed content is very intentional. It's very planned. It's very thoughtful and like,
[00:18:26] it just be real, right? Like if you don't have something to post that day, then don't post it. But
[00:18:32] at the same time, you can strategize and build that out to the place where like in my phone, I know
[00:18:38] what my next four or five pieces of content are already right now. It comes down to do I have time
[00:18:43] direct the caption, right? So today I wrote the caption and was able to get it out. And so that's why
[00:18:48] there's a new piece of content out. But for our clients, when we are helping do this for them or when
[00:18:54] we are coaching it for them, we tell them 30 pieces of content on a monthly basis. But more
[00:19:00] importantly, that 30 pieces of content is or what's important about it is what it is broken down
[00:19:06] into, right? So what are the four categories that make up the 30 pieces of content? Because I believe
[00:19:12] personally that there's this big sort of 80, 20 role that's floating around in the social media
[00:19:17] space. And I by no means am like saying, you know, these other individuals are not correct. I'm
[00:19:23] just simply saying that our strategy is a little bit different in the sense of of 30 pieces of
[00:19:29] content a month. 15 of those are personal. So half of them are who am I as a individual, right?
[00:19:37] And then the other 15 are broken down into three different categories. Each of those three
[00:19:41] categories are business related. But you have three different categories of business. So you're not
[00:19:47] shoving one specific conversation or one specific type of content down somebody's throat multiple
[00:19:53] times a month, right? So that 30 pieces of content if you're producing 30 consistently,
[00:20:00] what I will say is if we're doing it for you, you're going to get 30 a month. However, if you
[00:20:04] are the one doing it, don't stress out over, oh, it's been two or three days in between,
[00:20:10] just stay consistent with your calendar of what kind of content you should be producing
[00:20:15] and having that in place. Like, I know what's coming next. I just have to be able to get to it.
[00:20:20] And one of the cool things about Instagram that I think often gets forgotten was we tend to link
[00:20:26] Instagram and Facebook together. They're obviously same company and you know, one sort of birth
[00:20:31] the other in a sense. And we tend to think of them as similar platforms. They're really not because
[00:20:36] what you can do in Instagram are one of the major advantages as people can find you very easily.
[00:20:43] And they can find you through demonstration of some of your hobbies, your interests, your personal
[00:20:49] stuff as Michelle, as you were saying. And so, you know, through hashtags, through content,
[00:20:55] you can actually find other people that are into the same stuff you're into. And guess what?
[00:21:01] People who share experiences, people who share hobbies, passions, they tend to want to work together.
[00:21:06] So this is, it's fun. So whatever it is that agents do, maybe in their off hours, even as boring
[00:21:14] as it may be. If you're into reading, like, that's okay. That for some people, I mean, I don't think
[00:21:20] readings boring, but I understand that read writing content about it. You know, say, well, how do I
[00:21:23] do that? Well, you could do a video of a book review of something you just read that really blew your
[00:21:28] mind or you could just talk about this is the best book I read this year or whatever. There's lots
[00:21:33] of fun ways to take someone's passions and interests and produce really easy content.
[00:21:39] For sure, for sure, for sure. And that those hobbies and those interests, that is how you prospect.
[00:21:44] That knowing that about you, about yourself, is how you prospect. So you actually sort of started
[00:21:51] to say at DJ without even probably realizing that you were, but those hobbies, right? Like,
[00:21:56] if you're into reading, right, I'm super into reading. My husband and I love our quiet time.
[00:22:01] One of my sons is asleep on the weekends. He still maps for a solid two, two and a half hours.
[00:22:06] So we get our books out and it is like quiet time. Don't touch me. Don't talk to me like we are reading,
[00:22:11] right? But it is our favorite time. I just finished the fourth wing series. Rebecca Yara,
[00:22:17] who came out with those two books. And I'm now reading the left behind series if anybody's
[00:22:22] familiar with them, but I'm a diehard reader. I love real books. I don't, I'm not a huge
[00:22:27] audible person. I'd much rather hold it in my hand, but what where I'm going with this is when
[00:22:33] you are actively prospecting on the platform. So many times I hear people will say, how do I do that?
[00:22:40] Where do I start? Who do I interact with? And there's really some structure to that. So the way that
[00:22:45] I teach this quite simply is it's five days of the week. Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday,
[00:22:50] Friday. Each of the five days are associated to a specific category. And that category is designed
[00:22:55] to help you talk to the people that are ideal clients of yours that also share those mutual interests.
[00:23:01] So I'll do this as fast as possible. And I know we won't have time to like dig into each of the
[00:23:06] category specifically, but Mondays, for example, is following day. So what that means is that you're
[00:23:12] actually interacting with the people who are following you, not the other way around, right? So
[00:23:18] for clarity, when we open Instagram, and we look at our accounts, or when we open it and we see
[00:23:24] our grid or our feed, right? Both of those are going to show us people that are already, I'm sorry,
[00:23:29] that we're following, right? So we're going to see the same people that were normal or used to
[00:23:34] seeing, right? But if we flip that upside down, if I have 10.5,000 followers, right? And I only
[00:23:41] follow 1400, I'm not worried about the people that I'm following on this Monday day, right? Because I
[00:23:47] already know that I'm consistently interacting with those people just naturally. So on Monday, I'm
[00:23:52] focused on the 10 and a half thousand that are following me that I don't know, right? So if I'm
[00:23:57] scrolling that list, and I'm like, yeah, here's a REALTOR, I don't know. Here's a loan officer,
[00:24:00] I don't know, right? I am initiating contact with them. So I'm going to go to their account. I'm
[00:24:05] going to see if they have a new piece of content up. I'm going to see if they have a new story up,
[00:24:09] and I'm going to create engagement. There's some structure around how many and all of that, but I
[00:24:13] won't get into that. And the beautiful thing about Monday is if you've ever heard of like the one,
[00:24:20] two, or three degrees of separation, right? We all know the person somehow based off of that
[00:24:25] up to six degrees, or I guess six degrees of separation max is how far we would have to go before
[00:24:31] we would know somebody. Instagram literally hands that to you on a silver platter in this sense,
[00:24:36] because even like you and I getting connected DJ, how did that happen? Right? You interviewed
[00:24:41] somebody that I knew. So I clicked on her profile, did the suggested accounts button, got this big drop
[00:24:47] down of all these other accounts, and then boom, here's this keep it real podcast with DJ. And I'm
[00:24:53] like, oh, well, I go on podcast all the time, right? So here's an opportunity to create a relationship,
[00:24:58] and that relationship was built off of all I did was interact with a REALTOR that had started
[00:25:02] following me that I didn't know, right? So that and here you are. I mean, here we are, right?
[00:25:09] Which is beautiful. But so Monday's is really easy. And the sense of Monday's focus is on the people
[00:25:15] who are following you. They're there for a reason, right? Give them a reason to stay by being interactive
[00:25:21] with them. So just to make sure I understand. So I think this is gold. This is so important.
[00:25:28] So Monday's what we're doing is we're going into our feed. We are looking or we could go into our
[00:25:33] follower list, I guess. What would be the best way to figure out if we follow the person or not?
[00:25:38] Is it literally just one by one? Or do you have like a special checkered out? We're only focused on
[00:25:43] the people who are following us in this case. So what you would do is however many people are
[00:25:48] following you, a minus 10 and a half thousand, right? So I would literally just click on that
[00:25:52] number and I would just scroll through the list. And we have a tracker. It's a big really, I kind of
[00:25:59] lovingly say it. It's a very sexy Excel spreadsheet, but really it's just a big Excel spreadsheet.
[00:26:03] But it's all color coded and pretty and what I were right. But on Monday, you're going to end up
[00:26:08] adding anybody that you interact with. You're going to add their name to that list. And then you
[00:26:12] have a tab specifically for it that will grow. Because obviously you're not going to be able to
[00:26:17] interact with every single person that's following you every Monday. It's not reality.
[00:26:22] The reason and the reason that we're interacting with our followers content is the people that follow us
[00:26:30] is because they are going to notice that we're interacting and we're talking about engagement,
[00:26:34] like writing comments on their posts, maybe sending them a would a DM category or a cuss fight or
[00:26:42] okay. So any content, any contact with their content or themselves? Yeah. And keep in mind,
[00:26:49] right? Like if somebody starts following you and you don't know them, they obviously are
[00:26:53] following you for reasons. Something created the desire and the other individual to start following
[00:26:58] you. But if you don't show up for them in any form of reengage, right? Meaning if you start
[00:27:06] following me, DJ, and I just let it go and I just never go to your profile and engage back with you,
[00:27:11] you're sort of kind of a lurker follower and you're like, oh, I'm following Michelle, but
[00:27:16] no, I don't really know her. And eventually you might stop following me all together, right?
[00:27:21] So how do we create a stick factor? And then how do we create an opportunity to have a conversation
[00:27:25] with someone as it's happening, sort of striking while the iron is hot, if you will, or the concept
[00:27:32] of that when someone starts to consume us. Now we're not saying to somebody like, if you start
[00:27:36] following me right now, I'm not going to go and send you a DM and say, hey, thanks so much for
[00:27:41] following me. Like, absolutely not. We're not going to do that. We're going to engage like a
[00:27:45] normal human. We're going to go look at your content. See if you posted something that I can
[00:27:48] resonate with and then I'm going to re I'm going to react or respond to that.
[00:27:54] Yeah, I think you were you brought up a really good point. So what we're what you just talked about
[00:27:59] is the dreaded linked in connection. Because what happens sometimes when we accept a fri-
[00:28:05] Yeah, we know this. You accept a fri- you accept somebody. I don't know what they call a
[00:28:09] theme or connections, I think, in LinkedIn when you accept a connection friend, so to speak.
[00:28:14] You know, sometimes you instantly get those automatic DMs inside of LinkedIn saying like,
[00:28:19] oh, by the way, I want to sell you X, Y or Z or be your service provider and nobody likes that.
[00:28:24] Literally. So if you if someone follows you, don't just write them a DM. Thanks for following me.
[00:28:29] Would you like, do you need a REALTOR? That is not how humans interact and it is not how people-
[00:28:34] I mean, maybe once in a out of a thousand, you might get lucky, but everyone else will just be
[00:28:39] turned off because that's not you haven't demonstrated that you are interested in getting to know that
[00:28:43] person at all. Well, and that ties into the second big mistake that from your original question.
[00:28:48] We just magically got to this place where I feel like it's perfect to bring this up.
[00:28:54] Don't have an automated message in your DMs. Yes. And I get so many of them, right? Like if I and I
[00:29:01] just got one right now while you and I are recording live, I got one where I sent a message a
[00:29:07] while back and literally just got an auto responder. So she obviously has mini chat or something timed
[00:29:13] to send an auto responder at a certain time. Some people have them set automatically. So as soon as
[00:29:19] they get a message, they automatically send out an auto responder. So for context, right? Let's say,
[00:29:25] for example, DJU posts in your stories a picture of you holding a Dutch Rose that you went and got
[00:29:30] in the morning on your way to work, right? And I comment or engage back in that via story reply,
[00:29:36] AKDN, right? So if I respond to your story and I say, Oh my gosh, I'm a huge Dutch profan,
[00:29:41] I have recently been getting the protein coffee. What did you order? Question mark, send,
[00:29:47] and you then have an auto responder that kicks back and says, thanks so much for reaching out for
[00:29:51] to me for all your real estate needs. Here's my self-one number. Please call me like I'm instantly
[00:29:56] turned off. And I'm definitely not responding to you. But even more important than that,
[00:30:01] you are not going to ever see my message, right? Because now Instagram's not going to tell you that
[00:30:06] you have an unwritten message, right? So the amount of time that's going to lapse between you even
[00:30:12] seeing that there was that message from me in the first place to you responding to me is going to be
[00:30:17] way too long for me to be to for me to stay engaged. If that makes sense. It's totally. Yeah,
[00:30:25] it's interesting. And I also think too that in this as a man, I can only think about this from
[00:30:32] my perspective and maybe the male perspective is, you know, there is such a thing as called
[00:30:37] sliding into someone's DM. So as men, male REALTORS, we should be mindful of that, you know,
[00:30:44] it's been particular females like us. It never happens to me. I never get any unsolicited,
[00:30:50] sort of romantic things inside of Instagram, but women do. And so can we just really quickly talk
[00:30:57] about if we're going to DM somebody who follows us and we're not as familiar with them, we're going
[00:31:02] to send them, you know, hey, I saw you got this coffee or got this thing and I'm really into the same
[00:31:06] thing. How do we do that in a way that doesn't come off as flirtatious or non-professional?
[00:31:13] Do you have any just general guidelines there as a woman who probably gets those kind of messages
[00:31:18] that dissolve the thing? Yeah, unfortunately, I do. And when my husband and I first got married,
[00:31:22] we're actually about to celebrate five years, but when my husband and I very first got married,
[00:31:26] I always make fun of it together. Like I would get the messages and then I'd run into the other
[00:31:30] room and show them and he would respond and it would just be fun. But now it's not as funny anymore
[00:31:36] because I'm a mom and, you know, I'm very happily married and it's sort of just annoying.
[00:31:42] But here's the thing I will say is when I can very quickly tell intuitively when it's a message
[00:31:50] that is worthy of my response, right? So if someone just says hi, hi, and that's it, not responding.
[00:31:56] Right? If someone is sending me a message saying hi, beautiful, did it at all of this, obviously not
[00:32:02] responding, right? If someone says hi, do you have a few moments for us to chat, not responding to that?
[00:32:09] Yeah, that's the way I hate that one too. Hi, Michelle. Do you have room in your day to take on
[00:32:15] more clients? Like obviously you didn't look at my profile. Like if that's what you're right. So
[00:32:20] I think the number one thing I can tell every single one of you guys that are listening to this of
[00:32:24] how to how to deal with that is use your intuition, right? Men have it, women have it, we have
[00:32:32] different versions of the same intuition, but you can tell, right? And my pet peeve, if you will,
[00:32:37] is when a lot of the older generation will say, well, I just don't want to, I don't know, so I just
[00:32:43] respond to all of them. I'm like, no, just because I'm 33 and year 50 doesn't mean that at 50, I'm not
[00:32:48] going to have the same intuition that I currently have, right? So I think it's just a matter of like
[00:32:54] using your intuition and allowing. Using your best judgment. Yeah. And also as as men
[00:32:59] understanding, we don't get those kind of messages, but women do. So being extra mindful, I mean,
[00:33:05] literally, I've never once gotten one of those messages, but which is, which, you know, is just
[00:33:10] the different experiences that men and women have. I think it all depends on how you initially
[00:33:16] engage, right? And what you say on your side. And so there's some message structure that we teach,
[00:33:23] I'll give you, give it to you very quickly, but story replies when you're doing a story reply,
[00:33:28] it's designed to be in three parts. Now, any of you guys have ever read what to say or the art
[00:33:32] of conversation or any of these really very, very good sales psychology books. That is how I
[00:33:40] formulated all of this. So it's not just theory, right? This is truly like how it actually works on
[00:33:45] a day-to-day basis. But a story reply in those three parts. So again, all of these three parts is one
[00:33:50] message, but that one message is broken down into each of these sections or segments. So part number
[00:33:57] one is acknowledgement. So what is the person on the other side desire by using social media in
[00:34:04] the first place, right? To feel heard, to feel seen, to feel acknowledged for who we are and what
[00:34:08] we're doing. So if I'm responding to your story about Dutch bros and I don't acknowledge the
[00:34:14] fact that you're holding a cup of coffee or that you are holding Dutch bros coffee, I'm missing the
[00:34:19] boat there, right? I'm doing you a disservice and I'm doing myself a disservice in trying to build
[00:34:25] our relationship. So acknowledgement first. So I'm going to acknowledge quite literally, hey,
[00:34:31] it's awesome that you got Dutch bros. I'm a huge Dutch bros fan too. Then part number two to the
[00:34:36] message comes in, which is subliminal business play. So this has been tried and tested over and
[00:34:41] over and over again. And the best way to do this is to tie it into your clients or the fact that you
[00:34:48] have clients or the fact that you're actively working. So what would that sound like for you,
[00:34:54] right? Like, and let's pretend I am the real estate agent, Michelle, and I'm prospecting new DJ
[00:34:59] in my DMs, right? So I see the story of you posting or you holding Dutch bros. I'm going to say,
[00:35:05] it's awesome that you got Dutch bros. I'm a huge fan of Dutch bros as well. I've been getting the
[00:35:09] protein coffee recently. And then the subliminal business play might be Dutch bros is actually my
[00:35:14] favorite place to take clients for coffee before we go look at houses. That's my subliminal business
[00:35:20] play. So I'm not pro or I'm not selling them directly, right? I'm simply acknowledging the fact
[00:35:26] and bringing to light subliminal the fact that I have clients, right? Yeah. So you're telling
[00:35:33] instead of selling, you're basically talking about an experience that's related to your business
[00:35:39] without saying, and you might be the next person that I want to take to you're just saying,
[00:35:44] oh, hey, I love Dutch bros. I take all of my clients there before we go. I'm so glad to see
[00:35:49] another Dutch brother fan out there or whatever. And then the third part is ending it in the question,
[00:35:54] right? Ending it in the form of a question. So my final segment to that message that I'm sending
[00:35:59] you would be something like, what's your go to order at Dutch bros or how often are you stopping
[00:36:05] at Dutch bros is that, you know, I go three times a week and my husband hates it. Ha ha, right?
[00:36:11] So ending in the form of a question is designed to get engagement, right? So if I'm ending it in
[00:36:16] the question I'm anticipating you responding to me. And then when someone responds, so let's say
[00:36:22] you do respond, my job at this point is to keep the conversation going as long as I can, right? We all
[00:36:30] know that in sales, the number one thing that we need to do is capture attention for as long as possible,
[00:36:35] right? The longer we can keep it, the more likely we have the opportunity or we'll have the
[00:36:38] opportunity to convert it. So my number one suggestion in your DMs is live in the land of curiosity,
[00:36:46] meaning ask questions all the time constantly, never respond in the form of a statement or something
[00:36:53] that is a rhetorical question, right? In that sense, questions that are designed to continue the
[00:36:59] conversation is key because we have to get through the four to seven touch points that traditionally
[00:37:05] as well. A real estate lead takes anyways to convert in the first place. And there's also transition
[00:37:11] sort of ways to transition from the sort of this statement about the post into the question. So I
[00:37:20] was thinking as you were saying that, you know, what I would probably add if the roles were reversed is
[00:37:24] I would say like, Hey, Michelle, you know, after saying your Dutch brothers, that's awesome. I
[00:37:29] love Dutch brothers. I take my clients there. Hey, funny timing. I actually am looking for a new
[00:37:34] order. I'm kind of getting sick of my regular order. Do you mind sharing what you ordered? Would
[00:37:38] you recommend it or something like that where I'm yeah, and I'm just sort of a little bit more,
[00:37:45] you know, slowly and gently squeezing us into, Hey, by the way, tell me tell me something about you.
[00:37:51] Yeah. And I love that. And that's a thing about it is every single one of us, no matter who you are,
[00:37:56] you're going to do it a little differently. But the beauty of it is that you have to do it the way
[00:38:00] that you would do it and that there's no magic one to this question is the number one question.
[00:38:06] If you ask it, everybody's going to respond, right, it doesn't work that way. So being able to just
[00:38:12] be intuitive, I think is the key and most importantly, living in the land of curiosity in your messages.
[00:38:18] And I think the biggest thing that I want to make sure we don't miss is prospecting is not if I
[00:38:24] get to it, I'll get to it type of situation, right, especially when it comes to Instagram. So
[00:38:28] I prospect on Instagram every single day. I don't prospect in the form of cold calling at all
[00:38:34] anymore zero. I haven't had the cold calling years. I'm very grateful for that. But and if you're
[00:38:39] listening to this and you do cold call, that's you keep doing it, right, but designate a time of your day
[00:38:46] or time block it, which is I think the phrase that most people use, right, time block a hour of
[00:38:53] prospecting in your morning or in your afternoon, or if you don't have a solid hour, you can designate.
[00:38:58] Maybe it's a little bit in the morning and a little bit at night, right? But it has to be a
[00:39:04] non-negotiable. And I think that that's the problem with with Instagram right now is people are seeing
[00:39:09] it as if I if I have time, I'll get to it when I get to it versus this is an opportunity for me to
[00:39:14] truly never have to cold call again if I do it right because I can build a relationship digitally
[00:39:20] first, work through the touch points and then get on the phone with them. Hello, never having that
[00:39:26] weird gross cold call feeling ever again. That's super intrusive. Feels very invasive. You're
[00:39:31] catching them at the wrong time. They're like, why are you calling me? Who are you? I've already
[00:39:35] talked to five other REALTORS, right? Like we want to avoid all of that. And so avoiding that feeling
[00:39:41] is literally why I developed the prospecting part of the Instagram platform the way that we do it.
[00:39:47] Because I know how that felt many, many years ago and it's awful. I don't know anybody that enjoys
[00:39:53] getting on the phone. No, it's terrible. So Monday is for reaching out to our followers
[00:40:01] and initiating some sort of interest in their activities, their passions, and seeing if a conversation
[00:40:08] emerges from there at the very least, even if it doesn't, what we're doing is demonstrating
[00:40:13] care and that we're interested in someone else and that we're paying attention, which is one of
[00:40:20] the most flattering things that any human can experience is somebody paying attention to them.
[00:40:25] Like you said, being seen, being heard, most importantly being acknowledged. And that's through
[00:40:29] the content or the comments or the DM is, hey, I saw you did this thing awesome. That's really cool.
[00:40:36] What do we do on Tuesdays? So Tuesdays and thank you for pushing us along there. I tend to go on
[00:40:41] tangents when I kept asking. No, no, no, I could talk about I could talk about it for hours and I'm like,
[00:40:46] I got I better remember. Yeah. Anyway, yeah. Tuesdays and Thursdays are actually the same. So
[00:40:53] well, they typically have different categories, but the theory behind Tuesdays and Thursdays is the same.
[00:40:58] So what Tuesdays and Thursdays are is when you're not at home or when you're not
[00:41:02] where do you go? What hobbies do you have that you could potentially be having conversations
[00:41:06] with individuals about real estate? And I have a client. I'm going to use her as an example. She is
[00:41:12] a plant lady, hardcore plant lady. Every closing gift for every client is a really beautiful real plant.
[00:41:18] Right? I told her I was like, I can never hire you to be my REALTOR because I will kill the plant.
[00:41:24] But I love it. I love plants. I have green plants all over my house that most of them are not real.
[00:41:30] But when she brought that up in that context, she was like, well, how do I add? How do I make that
[00:41:36] a category where I can talk to other people about plants on Instagram and have it be in my area?
[00:41:42] Right? And she was shocked at how fast I was able to find 50. Oh, it's so easy. There's a
[00:41:49] yeah, you could go to any any florist. You could go to any plant person that's local. You could
[00:41:55] you could say, Hey, let's jump on an Instagram live. I'll promote your business. You promote
[00:41:59] we can talk about real estate and talk about plants. I'm just throwing this idea.
[00:42:03] Oh, and you're doing my job for me. Like that's exactly what the idea behind it is. So when it
[00:42:10] comes to finding them, right? Like we did this together on a Zoom meeting her and I literally googled
[00:42:15] plant shops in her area. She actually she happens to live in Connecticut. But so we googled plant
[00:42:21] shops and the only thing that really came up was home Depot and lows and we're like, no, no, no, no,
[00:42:25] right? So what I showed her was a trick that you can do on Instagram. And I said, Sarah, go find
[00:42:30] your plant shop that you go to on Instagram. She's like, Oh, I already know their account.
[00:42:35] So she goes to their account. And then in their profile, if you see the contact button and then
[00:42:40] right next to the contact button, there's this little tiny button that's a person with a plus sign.
[00:42:44] And if you click on that, it's going to give you this huge drop down of suggested accounts that
[00:42:49] Instagram is saying that based off of following this plant shop, you might like all of these,
[00:42:55] right? And we went through all of those so many of them were either other little plant shops,
[00:43:00] coffee shops that also sold plants in her area, bloggers that blogged about plants in her area.
[00:43:05] I mean, like the list was endless. And she was like, Michelle, my town is so small. How is this
[00:43:11] even a thing? And I'm like, thank you, Instagram, because you just created a community for yourself
[00:43:16] in your hyper local market, right? And I really want to hit on that in your hyper local market.
[00:43:23] Yeah, we're not finding plant shops from all over the country, which anybody could do. And that
[00:43:27] doesn't really necessarily speak to the local community. Correct. Right. But like Instagram, if by
[00:43:33] using that suggested button, right? Instagram is literally giving you what you are asking for,
[00:43:38] right? Which is I want to find other people who are into plants and other plant shops or other
[00:43:43] bloggers or whatever in my area. So to go back to your original question and to keep the flow and
[00:43:50] the tracker happening Tuesdays and Thursdays are designed to be these types of days, right? So
[00:43:55] you're focused on hobbies specifically or things that you enjoy outside of work. Now this could be
[00:44:00] at home, right? You could I have a client who's really in a home setting, right? If that's you,
[00:44:04] there's a whole community for that on Instagram. If you're into like knitting or arts and crafts or
[00:44:11] if you're a mom, right? I have a hockey mom client that I adore her. And she's like, Michelle, I don't
[00:44:16] do anything other than go to hockey like every single day we go to hockey. And I was like, that's a
[00:44:20] day on your tracker because all of the different arenas that your sons play in, all of the different
[00:44:26] teams that have their own Instagram accounts, all of the different small businesses that support the
[00:44:30] hockey community, AK cell hockey stuff, all of the coaches that have their own Instagrams, right?
[00:44:36] The list goes on and on and the beautiful thing about all of this. So Tuesdays and Thursdays,
[00:44:40] you can have different categories for each of the days, right? So if you have multiple hobbies or
[00:44:44] multiple different things, but the idea behind Tuesdays and Thursdays is that you are talking to
[00:44:50] people about things that you also share a passion for or an interest in. And if I'm commenting on,
[00:44:56] if I'm my client that's a hockey mom, right? If I'm client, if I'm sorry, if I'm commenting on
[00:45:03] hockey teams post about them winning a game or winning a match, right? Guess who's going to see
[00:45:10] my comment? All of the other moms are all of the other people that are into the hockey that are
[00:45:15] probably following that Instagram account. And the idea is that they are going to see my comment,
[00:45:20] they're going to see my interaction. They're going to click on my profile, go and see if you're
[00:45:25] doing it, right? That you are posting about hockey and that you're posting about your kids being
[00:45:29] interested in hockey too. And now there's this connection and then this subliminal part of that
[00:45:34] happens, which is we're showing all of our real estate content. We're showcasing our credibility
[00:45:38] through our testimonials and all these other things. But the connection is initially made via mutual
[00:45:45] shared passion or interest. Love it. So we're finding local people as best we can in our community. And
[00:45:53] just that little tip, that really cool tip that I did not know about is look for the little
[00:45:59] I so look for an account of a business or a page that that you're you know Instagram account that
[00:46:05] you're into that shares your one of your passions. And then you can see a little icon you click
[00:46:11] on that and it will show you suggested accounts that are very similar. And you can start looking
[00:46:16] to see if you can find also you can other find other accounts in the area. You can also there are
[00:46:21] Instagram you know there's search functionality too and Instagram and so you could also start
[00:46:26] searching via certain hashtags and obviously look for hyper local things like if you're if you want
[00:46:32] to find we do this here in Chicago a lot where there's so many different neighborhoods and suburbs
[00:46:37] that there's all these you know for example mom groups that talk about activities for children
[00:46:42] very common. And you know there's certain hashtags for that and you know etc. So okay so Tuesdays
[00:46:49] yeah the tracker the tracker when you build it out and thank you for saying all that because you
[00:46:53] again you're doing my job for me DJ good job. But uh the the tracker when it's built out right you
[00:47:00] have it broken into three categories. So you have hashtags accounts in geotags and each of your
[00:47:04] days of the week is separated that way with the exception of Mondays and Fridays. Mondays Wednesdays
[00:47:10] and Fridays which we'll talk about here in a second but so Tuesdays and Thursdays you have hashtags
[00:47:14] you have accounts you have geotags and then we teach a trick called the wormhole effect which is
[00:47:20] simply if you click on one of those hockey pages for example you find the hockey arena that your
[00:47:26] kid plays out consistently and you click on their most recent piece of content let's say they have
[00:47:31] 30 likes if you click on the people who liked it you then start interacting with those individuals
[00:47:36] right so that's the wormhole effect with the idea behind that being you're connecting with more and
[00:47:41] more people that are actively using the page or consuming the page and just getting your name exposed
[00:47:46] to those who are interested in the same thing in your area so. So quick question about that so you
[00:47:51] just said something very powerful so again let's say we're we're our passion is being a hockey mom
[00:47:57] and we are looking at the account for the the the rink the the arena that our our child plays at
[00:48:05] and we see all of the other you know hockey moms that might be following that Instagram account
[00:48:11] how do you encourage people to interact because this is going to be people that don't know you
[00:48:17] but that have a shared interest you're both into hockey being hockey mom and you're going to the
[00:48:21] arena what would you say is a great point of engagement how do you how do you sort of initiative.
[00:48:27] It goes back to the exact same the same methodology right so the same three prong initial response
[00:48:34] which is acknowledgment supplemental business play and then in the form of a question now if that's
[00:48:39] for story replies right or DMs story reply and DM is the same thing for those of you guys listening
[00:48:44] that don't know the the terminology they are the same right so if you're responding to a story that
[00:48:48] ends up being a DM but if you're commenting on someone's content on their feed it's a little
[00:48:53] bit different right it's a little simpler you don't need to do a full three prong response
[00:48:57] but you do need to do it have it acknowledgment right I will tell every single one of you
[00:49:03] if you are commenting on a piece of content and your comment doesn't stand out to me as the person
[00:49:09] that produced content or produced the piece of content I'm not responding to you right so if you're
[00:49:14] like awesome content great photo um this is really cute or your son is really cute exclamation point
[00:49:20] it's like that's what everybody says right and not to be facetious about it but to simply say
[00:49:24] in a C of a bunch of comments your job is to stand out so if you see somebody posting um of their
[00:49:32] sons playing at the same hockey arena that your son plays right acknowledge it oh my gosh this
[00:49:38] is awesome I had no idea that you guys also play hockey here I've been coming here with my son
[00:49:43] for the last five years period right um and that could be something that's going to stand out
[00:49:50] now if you're responding to her story that individual story that posted that photo of her boys
[00:49:54] in front of the hockey arena and you're like well how do you break the ice same concept right the
[00:49:58] three promise were apply applies um which is acknowledge subliminal business plan and then the
[00:50:06] form of a question so your final question to that could be something like um I've been coming here
[00:50:12] with my sons for the last five years how long have you and your boys been playing at this arena
[00:50:16] and you can even go on step further like when are you guys there um I would love to like say hi
[00:50:21] right like say hi yeah you know um but it gets a lot easier when you have that shared connection or
[00:50:28] that mutual interest and then the thing about that which is funny is to your point DJ which is
[00:50:34] there's a degree of separation where you may even realize that you already knew that person without
[00:50:38] even realizing it right so you may click on their profile and be like oh that's the life of this
[00:50:44] person or oh that's the best friend of this person that I've never talked to right and it becomes
[00:50:49] so easy to start a conversation um so Tuesdays and Thursdays are that right and I always say
[00:50:56] it's just think through that and you're everyone's like well I'm really boring I don't do anything
[00:50:59] no that's not true right um you have interest you have passions even if you don't leave that
[00:51:05] even if it's a tv show that you watch it I was doing this the other day I was watching um the
[00:51:11] curse which is a show and showtime and I it's one of the most uncomfortable shows I've ever seen
[00:51:16] it's purposely written to certainly um activate someone's anxiety and interpersonal sort of
[00:51:23] challenges it's it's it's really it's Emma Stone and Nathan Field her it's very very good but anyway
[00:51:28] it's very hard I find it very difficult to watch and there's a lot of symbolism in the show and I go
[00:51:32] I am going to the Reddit forum or the Reddit group for the subreddit for the curse and there is one
[00:51:38] and I'm like I think they're trying to portray him as like a Jesus light character and
[00:51:43] anyway I wanted to see if my theory was was accurate and sure enough other people had the exact same
[00:51:49] theory but you could do the same thing on Instagram you can say I just saw the ending of episode so
[00:51:55] and so with with this you could even post content about it and say I don't really understand what
[00:51:59] the ending means if anyone has seen this if you have you know ideas or you could search for other
[00:52:05] people's content about that particular episode say hey I just found your content I'm a little
[00:52:08] confused about the ending uh here's what I think but what do you think I mean it doesn't have to be
[00:52:13] something you even go out and do it could be something you consume like uh you know like coffee or
[00:52:17] or tv show or book or anything yep and the easiest the easiest way to do it if you're like
[00:52:22] sitting struggling thinking of ideas for topics is if you're like you're a Chicago right but Chicago
[00:52:28] is freaking massive so the thing about that is five subsidies or five sub uh sub not sub
[00:52:34] divisions but five sub cities within the city so I live in Clarksville Tennessee right but my
[00:52:40] husband and I live in San go which is a subsidy within the Clarksville zip code but hearing Clarksville
[00:52:45] if I were to say to a mom or somebody at the gym or whatever oh yeah we live in San go everybody
[00:52:51] knows what that means so if you go to Instagram and you type in hashtag saying go Tennessee that
[00:52:55] is going to come up so um if you're gonna do it on a Tuesday or a Thursday what I would recommend
[00:53:01] is pick your top five sub cities or cities specifically that you sell real estate in or want to
[00:53:07] um find hashtags find geotags find specific accounts that are related to those cities so here
[00:53:13] intent or here in Clarksville we have a Instagram page called local Clarksville which is basically the
[00:53:19] page that shares anything and everything restaurants mom stuff book stores coffee shop everything right
[00:53:26] for Clarksville and that page becomes sort of the springboard to all these other pages that could
[00:53:32] give you ideas of who to be engaging with in different types of accounts so um Tuesdays or
[00:53:38] Thursdays you could just do it what we call small business day which is you're using those five
[00:53:42] sub cities and then just looking up their hashtags looking up their geotags and then just go into town
[00:53:46] um so yeah there's uh there's a for example is a jean store I go to that just happens to be a
[00:53:52] block from where I live and it's really I think probably the only good jean store in Chicago are
[00:53:57] certainly one of few and they have uh it's tough it's tough out there is a small business owner
[00:54:03] that all they sell are jeans and yeah they sell very expensive jeans and you have to be
[00:54:07] into expensive jeans in order to like want to spend the kind of money to do that so they are
[00:54:12] struggling like every other small business so one of my first calls would be like hey I know there's
[00:54:16] all other guys like me out there that probably don't even know you guys exist so I want to make sure
[00:54:21] that people know you exist because I love having you in my neighborhood and by the way I'm a real
[00:54:25] turn and I do this but what I really want to do is focus on promoting your jeans because I wear
[00:54:30] them I'm a big fan can I come in and do a quick you know five minute interview with you uh obviously
[00:54:35] there's no downside for the owner unless they don't want to be on camera um somebody will do it um
[00:54:40] it's free and you you're gonna tag them they're gonna tag you you promote it they promote it
[00:54:45] everybody wins you could do that yeah twice a week easy oh easy easy and and obviously the hobbies is
[00:54:52] the key focus with the small business sort of being that backup to that um but for sake of time
[00:54:57] I want to give you guys Wednesday so Wednesday is what I call CRM day so this is a very important day
[00:55:04] that I can tell you right now I've been doing this specifically for Beyond the Method and my program
[00:55:09] for five years and people still don't do this which I'm assuming that's probably why I'm still
[00:55:14] a business obviously but um but it's I say that funnily but what Wednesdays are designed to be
[00:55:20] is CRM day so what that means is you are taking your database and your cold leads right so if you're
[00:55:26] paying Realtor.com lead still flex leads my lopo whatever red X whoever right you're purchasing data
[00:55:32] from find them on Instagram and find them oh that's brilliant I never would have thought
[00:55:39] to do that is such a great idea right so like in your excel doc on Wednesday you have a tab at the
[00:55:44] bottom you upload the CSV file out of your CRM now depending on what CRM you use like something like
[00:55:51] follow up boss right for example they will link a Facebook profile to an individual it doesn't
[00:55:56] link Instagram yet for whatever reason I don't know tell them to work on it but um it'll link a
[00:56:01] Facebook profile you can go look at that person's Facebook or try to find and see if it's the right
[00:56:06] one and then cross check it to Instagram now the reason for that is most of the time a person is
[00:56:13] going to have the same profile photo on Facebook and Instagram that they would on one or the other
[00:56:17] platforms right we typically do that um that means that you'll be able to confirm or deny this is
[00:56:23] the same person especially because a lot of people especially if it's individual personal accounts
[00:56:28] they're private right so in order for you to send or follow them on Instagram you're going to have
[00:56:33] to send a follow request they have to approve it so if you're going to do that you want to make sure
[00:56:37] you're following the right person and confirm that based off of seeing them on Facebook first um so
[00:56:43] on Wednesday there it's two parts right you're uploading your CRM you got 500 names a thousand names
[00:56:48] whatever it is um and you're working through the list you're finding them on Facebook you then
[00:56:52] cross check find them on Instagram and every Wednesday you just keep working through that list and
[00:56:56] make sure that you consistently you're talking to the people that are on that list so you take the first
[00:57:01] 45 then the next Wednesday you go do the next 45 you just keep working through until you repeat
[00:57:06] at the top of the list um in the process of doing that you're obviously going to start having a lot of
[00:57:11] really good warm conversations so eventually that person's going to get moved off of Wednesday
[00:57:17] onto another day of your tracker aka friday which is what we call reengage day um and I know that
[00:57:22] this is getting somewhat confusing but visually it's a lot easier to see but um that's what that's
[00:57:28] what Wednesdays are designed to be the the cold lead part of it is if you get a if you're buying leads
[00:57:35] in any capacity right the Zillow leads is a great example because when Zillow calls you or when you
[00:57:40] get a lead from Zillow they're just calling you right like you don't have time yeah live transfer
[00:57:45] and and know like oh this is mishau for micro calling me this is her Instagram she has the dog
[00:57:50] she has a two and a like she you don't have that access that fast right um so the beautiful thing
[00:57:55] about that side of it is when someone calls you like that you get this inbound lead your job as the
[00:58:02] real estate agent moving on from that or in moving on from right now to every conversation you have
[00:58:08] moving forward is on the phone with them let's say it's you DJ right and i you and i are you are
[00:58:14] inbound calling me i'm the REALTOR you're the Zillow lead coming in so i'm going to say hi DJ this is
[00:58:19] mishau for micro great that you are calling blah blah go into my script right um but then here's
[00:58:25] where this gets important at the very end of the conversation it is your job to make sure you are
[00:58:30] connected to them on Instagram right so at the end of your call you will literally say hey DJ this
[00:58:36] has been an amazing chat with you i'm really looking forward to seeing you on saturday when we go
[00:58:39] to or xyz property or on friday when we go meet for coffee to talk about your house blah blah right
[00:58:45] but before we hang up really fast i want to make sure we're connected on Instagram because
[00:58:49] that's my primary platform that is the primary place that i communicate with all of my clients
[00:58:54] so what's your instagram account really fast yeah it almost doesn't even give them the option to say
[00:59:01] no because you've already qualified it by saying hey this is where i communicate most effectively
[00:59:06] and most consistently so yeah if you know i wouldn't even ask if you don't mind i would just say
[00:59:10] yeah what's what's yeah like just like you said but i had a i had a client and i'm curious what your
[00:59:14] thought is on this dj because i had a client who was like michelle is it weird to say that like
[00:59:19] is somebody gonna think that that's weird and i might have a kid not okay it can seem weird
[00:59:24] yeah but the way that you said it was not weird you qualified it you explained why you were asking for
[00:59:30] it and it was a perfectly logical reason yeah so i think if you just said hey what's your
[00:59:35] Instagram then people can have all sorts of thoughts in their head about why are they asking for
[00:59:39] this are they are they flirting with me are they you know who knows um but i think by saying by
[00:59:45] qualifying at the way you did it gives really no reason for somebody to say no yeah you're just
[00:59:51] having a conversation with someone and you're quite literally saying this is my primary method of
[00:59:55] communication i know we had discussed meeting on friday for coffee so i just want to make sure we're
[01:00:00] connected there so then if you have any questions between now and friday when i see you you can message
[01:00:04] me right perfect so and then once that happens once you start following them or they start following
[01:00:10] you they obviously get added to your tracker so you can track that that individual is now following
[01:00:15] you so that you can stay consistently in front of them um because i will say REALTORS are notorious
[01:00:20] for terrible follow up um i think everybody would say that that they are yeah even if they've been
[01:00:25] in business forever right they'll say like my biggest weakness is not like closing the loop right
[01:00:31] closing and working the lead until you get a heart no um and so that's certainly a way to make
[01:00:36] sure that you can track it but um yeah so that's my day Tuesday Wednesday and Thursday friday is
[01:00:42] simply re-engage today so what that means is quite literally re-engage anybody that you've had
[01:00:46] a good conversation with um so if a conversation comes to a natural stopping point which it will they
[01:00:52] all do normal it's very normal um you simply re-engage them and then the way that we do this as we
[01:00:57] track and we color code them right so if it's the first re-engage if it's the second re-engage etc
[01:01:02] we can track that um and then once we've gotten to four or five really solid back and forth and
[01:01:09] really solid touch points with that individual then it's our job to go for the ask right your job
[01:01:13] is to get them on the phone attempt to set an appointment um whatever that looks like for you
[01:01:18] zoom meeting calendar link whatever whatever that is for you um but you have to attempt to go for the
[01:01:24] ask at that point and then um friday basically gives me the opportunity to stay in front of all of your
[01:01:29] warm leads and then what are we doing on the weekends or are we taking the weekends i don't engage on
[01:01:36] the weekends um and that's that's mean personally um i what i tell everybody is the tracker that i've
[01:01:44] designed is monday through friday um if but it's what i mean by that is it's five days right so it's
[01:01:50] five days design monday through friday however if you want to do it Tuesday through saturday i don't care
[01:01:54] right if you want to do it once day through sunday i don't care there's no um better day or
[01:01:58] worst day it's a matter of like what are the five days for you that are going to make sense um i also
[01:02:04] know that real estate agents notoriously are the busiest on saturday and sunday so asking them to
[01:02:08] prospect um and spend an hour in their dms or an hour on instagram specifically doing what i'm teaching
[01:02:14] is going to be harder right um mondays there's no reason most most real estate agents are used
[01:02:20] monday says they're admin day or as they're like chill i'm gonna catch up day because of a crazy weekend
[01:02:25] um so but that's just how it's been formulated but if your schedule is completely different and
[01:02:31] everything i just said doesn't apply to you as far as days then do it do the five days on the days
[01:02:36] that makes sense for you so just to sort of recap the the way that i think you're telling people to
[01:02:44] approach instagram is really as a connection tool yeah not as much of a consumption tool so we're
[01:02:50] either going to use it to unwind and sort of just have you know entertain ourselves with other
[01:02:57] people's content but for using this far for our business we want to be super intentional and think
[01:03:02] of it is how do we find how do i find people who are into the same things i'm into and how do i
[01:03:08] engage them on a regular basis so that we can share our passions and connect that way and then
[01:03:14] we can naturally lead that into hey oh by the way i'm a real estate agent etc uh yeah so so we really
[01:03:21] for the if we're finding people we don't already know we're really looking for shared interests
[01:03:25] we're connecting that way and then we're moving on and at some point you're getting more shared
[01:03:30] connection keep that in mind right right um yes thank you because a shared connection is equally
[01:03:35] as powerful as a shared connection i'm sorry as a shared um passion or a hobby yeah um because
[01:03:42] some of my closest friends in the industry today right i don't know if you've ever interviewed
[01:03:47] Kyle Draper DJ but if not you should right but um Kyle and i became very good friends because we
[01:03:53] accidentally found each other on instagram and we're like hey we were both on the same show and now
[01:03:58] anytime i'm in Dallas i am always having dinner or meeting up with Kyle we've also spoken in
[01:04:04] events together we've done podcasts all the things right um and what's funny about that is i'm at
[01:04:09] Kyle during uh COVID when clubhouse was really big at the time so i heard Kyle's voice went to
[01:04:15] instagram found him realized we had all these connections and was like oh my gosh i just got to send
[01:04:19] him a message so i did fast forward you know three plus years here we are um so i think it's
[01:04:25] just as much about mutual interest or shared passions as it is actual just straight up connections
[01:04:32] right and what those degrees of separation might be that could turn into a business opportunity or
[01:04:38] in in your guys' case on the real estate side specifically um elite right like oh you you worked
[01:04:44] with so-and-so that i know or oh i know the owner of that place how often do you go
[01:04:50] yeah it's funny i always think about this with because this podcast we interview mostly a top
[01:04:56] 1% agents from all over the country and i i recruit agents so um if i were not hosting this podcast
[01:05:03] and some other buddy somebody else was doing what i do i would be calling those agents that you
[01:05:09] know we're interviewed in my area that we're featured on any podcast whether it's mine or someone
[01:05:13] else's and be like hey by the way i just listen to your interview with such and such podcast
[01:05:18] you're exactly the kind of agent we want at our firm if you're ever thinking about you know
[01:05:24] this idea of you know using media to find people to find prospects to connect
[01:05:32] is really just the way that we we think of it mostly as a consumption model i'm going to consume
[01:05:38] others content or i'm going to just post you know stuff about by business um we're not really
[01:05:43] thinking about it so much in the terms of connections so i love that that's like the major focus
[01:05:48] for you is how do we actually connect um and let's we want to make sure that if you're loving
[01:05:53] what michelle is saying and i i don't know how you wouldn't be because that i'm learning a tremendous
[01:05:58] amount and i've had instagram experts on our show for a long time and i've not learned ever this much
[01:06:04] before so if you're liking what michelle is saying and you are uh please go to uh please consider
[01:06:11] investing in beyond the method you can find that at berman media pd that's paul david so berman media

Michelle, welcome to the show. Thanks so much for having me. I'm so excited to be here. I'm so excited. I'm so excited to have you. We rarely ever talk about Instagram and I am not particularly skilled at Instagram myself. So I am excited to learn along with our audience. But tell me more about you. How did you get involved in social? Yeah, this is my absolute favorite story to tell. So thanks for starting with that question for sure, but I actually got into the Instagram space way back in 2014. So when that started at that time of my life, Instagram was much more about sort of the influencer space, right? In the sense of, you know, not necessarily holding a pretty hot product and getting paid to do it. But more so, I was the broker between the large brands and the Instagram accounts that we were placing content on or buying ad space on. So really what happened was I was sort of in the middle of these huge brands trying to promote product, trying to drive website clicks and trying to drive views. And honestly, at that point, buying things off Instagram wasn't really a thing yet. You had to go to a website. So I was in between the brand and in between the accounts themselves. So in that process, I personally purchased several large Instagram accounts to do this on my own. So I was selling ad space of my own. I was working with the brands to create all the ads, writing all the copy, deciding on which pages to put their content on to hopefully drive sales. And what I learned in the process was really, really quickly, how to see through the crap, right? I hope I can say that that way. But fake views, fake likes, fake everything. That's on the platform, right? Because it was my job to sniff it out because if a company was paying me a large sum of money to help them produce more money. And we put, we chose that Instagram page to put their ad on and it didn't produce anything. The metal ultimately fell back on me. So in the process, I just had to really be able to sniff that stuff out. So with that being said, I got very good at understanding what worked, what didn't work, what kind of content was going to resonate with an audience and what wasn't, what kind of copy was going to actually get someone to take action. So long story short, I face planted into the art of human psychology and sales psychology and have those two worlds merge fast forward to today. I run a very large Instagram prospecting company. So we specialize in teaching real estate agents and loan officers how to actually actively prospect on Instagram versus what a lot of us know as passive prospecting, right? Which is traditionally what Instagram has been, which is sort of this platform of just post content, make good videos, write good captions, make sure you show up in your stories consistently, but then you just sort of sit and wait for inbound messages. So you're sort of living in this reactive space. And I have spent the better part of, you know, close to five years since launching beyond the method. Trying to flip that upside down and showing people that Instagram is not just a placeholder for great content. It's a platform that can actually replace a lot of the outbound prospecting that you have to do or that real estate agents tend to do in the form of like cold calling and all kinds of other things. So that's the the fast way to go from 2014 to today. This is really I'm really excited to dive into this because I, I really only know to look at Instagram from a research and development perspective from an agent. So an agent can follow all of their clients and their prospects and learn about their lives and then use that as reasoning to reach out. Hey, I saw you on an vacation. I saw the picture of that fancy dinner you made. So that's and that is not about posting content. And so I'm really excited to learn more about sort of best practices with content and also relationship building. But the only thing I know to do with Instagram is be like, Oh, I saw somebody did this and maybe I could reach out and develop, you know, a stronger relationship that way. But there's so much more, of course, to developing a content calendar, really thinking about what kind of content somebody can, somebody can produce and promote that actually drives business in a way that's authentic and and not salesy. So yeah, let's talk about it. Well, maybe the first thing to talk about is what do REALTORS get wrong about their own Instagram accounts? Like what are they doing that you just go, gosh, if I could wave a magic wand and tell them all not to do this, what are they doing that you wish they'd just. Oh my god, how much time do we have DJ? All the time. There's a handful of them and I'm going to do my best to keep it Twitter-align as far as how I would describe this. But there's really two big ones that jump out at me as someone who spends all day, every day consuming real estate agents content on Instagram. First and foremost is their leveraging boilerplate templates, right? So what that means is that they're using services that are producing the same type of content for every person that's using the service. And the problem with that is for you as the real estate agent, right? You're like, yes, this is easy, it's cheap, cool. Now I don't have to worry about it. I checked my social media box. But the problem is that there's no person there. There's no brand built into that. There's definitely no like who is Michelle or who is DJ involved in that content. And the problem with that for me as a consumer is I'm not hiring you as a real estate agent because your content says that you're the top 1% in your area. I'm hiring you because I like you as a human. There's something psychologically that's connecting us, right? Oh, you're in the CrossFit too. So am I. My husband runs ultra marathon's weight. So it is mine. Right now we're building this like very intentional and very authentic relationship. And then you as the real estate agent, I hire you as the vehicle to get me from I want to buy a house, but I'm to I now own a house, but I'm choosing you because I like you and then you just become the mechanism to get me there, right? And so I think real estate agents think that Instagram is a place for them to show off. And it's sort of overproduced and it's like this big giant production of content. And I have had in my almost 10 years, I've probably had a videographer follow me around like maybe three or four times on one hand, right? So 95% of the content that I produce on a daily basis is from my phone. That's it, right? So. So we're so if I understand you correctly, we're talking about, for example, the kinds of boilerplate content that REALTORS often will fall back on is closed, closed sale or I just won this award or I just got, you know, I'm in the top as you said 1%. I just again, it's it's achievement. Here are all my achievements or and you're right. That doesn't really speak to what I mean anyone other than your parents might want to see or your maybe your best friends. But boilerplate, boilerplate content also second to your point there DJ because yes, absolutely. But the second part to boilerplate content is if you've ever seen those sort of stock images that go out right where if you're if you're paying, you know, 150 bucks a month and it posts on your behalf and all it does is slap your photo on it. But it's the background is a kitchen that's not of one of your listings or it's not like that type of stuff, right? It's very unauthentic. It's definitely not organic content. And it's usually with rinse wash repeat, right? So I have a friend that I'm talking to on Instagram right now and he recommended another person to me and he's like, Hey, you got to go look at this guy's Instagram and then you got a yell at him because I know him. So tell him I told you to yell at him. And I was like, what are you talking about? And I pulled up his Instagram and every single piece of content was one of these stock templates and the only personal photo on the entire account with over 200 posts was his profile photo. That's it. So that's the problem, right? Is like if I click on this gentleman's account, I'm like, who is this dude? Right? It's just business, business, business, business or a cool template. So should should we think about Instagram as yes a way to demonstrate what we know and and maybe some of our achievements, I certainly feel there's a place for that. But most importantly, would you define Instagram as a way for people to get to know me or the agent as an actual individual both professionally and whatever degree of personal somebody wants to expose? Absolutely. One million percent. And there's certainly a great point there that you just mentioned that I don't want to skip over, which is, you know, how personal are you willing to get? You know, I have a private coaching client who he is not comfortable posting his children on Instagram. I have no problem with that, right? I have a two and a half year old. So any of you guys who see my Instagram, you'll see him. He's the best thing ever. But I love talking about him. I love posting about him. But not everybody is that comfortable, right? When you when you have things like hunting or shooting, right? Like my husband is a medically retired green beret. So we shoot a lot. Like we have we have we own several guns and in our home. And for me, that's just part of who I am. But that's not going to go on my Instagram, right? Like maybe a video of my husband and I going to the range for like a date night, but I'm not going to be posting other content related to the gun piece, right? And is the reasoning for that? That is the reason for not posting gun content because you feel that's a barely polarizing topic or yeah, but at the same time, I'm not going to diminish who my husband was and the fact that he served our or served our country and is an incredible shooter. Like and we have a lot of fun going and doing it. But it's also like another big one is the religion piece, right? Like can we use can we use that in our content? Yes and no, right? But I have clients who, for example, they'll say like Michelle, we love hunting. So how can we post about hunting without it being this polarizing thing? And what I always say is maybe we don't post the dead animal, but maybe we just post pictures in front of our car in our camel, right? Like getting ready to go. So there is certainly a way to be able to talk about anything and everything that you want to talk about in a way that is designed to be comfortable and consumable. But Instagram as a platform as as a whole is designed to be a place where someone gets to know me as a human and gets to see how credible of a XYZ I am, right? In this case, we're talking about real estate agents. So I don't care as a consumer if I'm your first house you've ever sold or your hundredth house you've ever sold. Because if I don't like you, I'm still not going to hire you. Even if everyone is saying you're the number one person. So that's where the active prospecting piece of what I teach specifically comes in because in order for me to determine as a consumer that you're the real estate agent that I want to hire, there's some some sort of qualifications, if you will, that are going to make me feel the need or sort of the urge, if you will, to reach out to somebody via social. That makes sense. I'd like to ask a few other questions that are coming to mind that REALTORS often ask me about social and I'm not an expert at all. But one of the questions and I know this isn't an easy quick answer. But how often to how often to post, right? And we'll start with how often to post. So I know this is part of your program. And by the way, we should really be plugging Michelle's program because she goes through this in step by step details. But beyond the method, it's been around for five plus years. She updates it all the time and you can find that at BermanMediaPD.com and we'll have a link to that. But as far as sometimes agents are like, gosh, I don't have all this time. So what what is your first sort of answer or response to somebody going, how much how much time is this going to take and how how many posts should I be doing? It's such a big question and it's so loaded. What I what we do for our clients, we have a 30-day calendar, right? So we post 30 days out of the month for me personally. If you consume my content, I post once every two or three days on my grid and I am in stories constantly. So stories is for me personally as someone who's you know on zoom, I don't even know how many times a day, way too many hours, my end of hour monthly zoom report would be really bad. You know, like your phone tells you like your screen time report, it's up 60% or whatever. I would be worried or nervous to see my zoom one. But so for me, my focus and my emphasis is on my stories consistently every single day. And then my feed content is very intentional. It's very planned. It's very thoughtful and like, it just be real, right? Like if you don't have something to post that day, then don't post it. But at the same time, you can strategize and build that out to the place where like in my phone, I know what my next four or five pieces of content are already right now. It comes down to do I have time direct the caption, right? So today I wrote the caption and was able to get it out. And so that's why there's a new piece of content out. But for our clients, when we are helping do this for them or when we are coaching it for them, we tell them 30 pieces of content on a monthly basis. But more importantly, that 30 pieces of content is or what's important about it is what it is broken down into, right? So what are the four categories that make up the 30 pieces of content? Because I believe personally that there's this big sort of 80, 20 role that's floating around in the social media space. And I by no means am like saying, you know, these other individuals are not correct. I'm just simply saying that our strategy is a little bit different in the sense of of 30 pieces of content a month. 15 of those are personal. So half of them are who am I as a individual, right? And then the other 15 are broken down into three different categories. Each of those three categories are business related. But you have three different categories of business. So you're not shoving one specific conversation or one specific type of content down somebody's throat multiple times a month, right? So that 30 pieces of content if you're producing 30 consistently, what I will say is if we're doing it for you, you're going to get 30 a month. However, if you are the one doing it, don't stress out over, oh, it's been two or three days in between, just stay consistent with your calendar of what kind of content you should be producing and having that in place. Like, I know what's coming next. I just have to be able to get to it. And one of the cool things about Instagram that I think often gets forgotten was we tend to link Instagram and Facebook together. They're obviously same company and you know, one sort of birth the other in a sense. And we tend to think of them as similar platforms. They're really not because what you can do in Instagram are one of the major advantages as people can find you very easily. And they can find you through demonstration of some of your hobbies, your interests, your personal stuff as Michelle, as you were saying. And so, you know, through hashtags, through content, you can actually find other people that are into the same stuff you're into. And guess what? People who share experiences, people who share hobbies, passions, they tend to want to work together. So this is, it's fun. So whatever it is that agents do, maybe in their off hours, even as boring as it may be. If you're into reading, like, that's okay. That for some people, I mean, I don't think readings boring, but I understand that read writing content about it. You know, say, well, how do I do that? Well, you could do a video of a book review of something you just read that really blew your mind or you could just talk about this is the best book I read this year or whatever. There's lots of fun ways to take someone's passions and interests and produce really easy content. For sure, for sure, for sure. And that those hobbies and those interests, that is how you prospect. That knowing that about you, about yourself, is how you prospect. So you actually sort of started to say at DJ without even probably realizing that you were, but those hobbies, right? Like, if you're into reading, right, I'm super into reading. My husband and I love our quiet time. One of my sons is asleep on the weekends. He still maps for a solid two, two and a half hours. So we get our books out and it is like quiet time. Don't touch me. Don't talk to me like we are reading, right? But it is our favorite time. I just finished the fourth wing series. Rebecca Yara, who came out with those two books. And I'm now reading the left behind series if anybody's familiar with them, but I'm a diehard reader. I love real books. I don't, I'm not a huge audible person. I'd much rather hold it in my hand, but what where I'm going with this is when you are actively prospecting on the platform. So many times I hear people will say, how do I do that? Where do I start? Who do I interact with? And there's really some structure to that. So the way that I teach this quite simply is it's five days of the week. Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday. Each of the five days are associated to a specific category. And that category is designed to help you talk to the people that are ideal clients of yours that also share those mutual interests. So I'll do this as fast as possible. And I know we won't have time to like dig into each of the category specifically, but Mondays, for example, is following day. So what that means is that you're actually interacting with the people who are following you, not the other way around, right? So for clarity, when we open Instagram, and we look at our accounts, or when we open it and we see our grid or our feed, right? Both of those are going to show us people that are already, I'm sorry, that we're following, right? So we're going to see the same people that were normal or used to seeing, right? But if we flip that upside down, if I have 10.5,000 followers, right? And I only follow 1400, I'm not worried about the people that I'm following on this Monday day, right? Because I already know that I'm consistently interacting with those people just naturally. So on Monday, I'm focused on the 10 and a half thousand that are following me that I don't know, right? So if I'm scrolling that list, and I'm like, yeah, here's a REALTOR, I don't know. Here's a loan officer, I don't know, right? I am initiating contact with them. So I'm going to go to their account. I'm going to see if they have a new piece of content up. I'm going to see if they have a new story up, and I'm going to create engagement. There's some structure around how many and all of that, but I won't get into that. And the beautiful thing about Monday is if you've ever heard of like the one, two, or three degrees of separation, right? We all know the person somehow based off of that up to six degrees, or I guess six degrees of separation max is how far we would have to go before we would know somebody. Instagram literally hands that to you on a silver platter in this sense, because even like you and I getting connected DJ, how did that happen? Right? You interviewed somebody that I knew. So I clicked on her profile, did the suggested accounts button, got this big drop down of all these other accounts, and then boom, here's this keep it real podcast with DJ. And I'm like, oh, well, I go on podcast all the time, right? So here's an opportunity to create a relationship, and that relationship was built off of all I did was interact with a REALTOR that had started following me that I didn't know, right? So that and here you are. I mean, here we are, right? Which is beautiful. But so Monday's is really easy. And the sense of Monday's focus is on the people who are following you. They're there for a reason, right? Give them a reason to stay by being interactive with them. So just to make sure I understand. So I think this is gold. This is so important. So Monday's what we're doing is we're going into our feed. We are looking or we could go into our follower list, I guess. What would be the best way to figure out if we follow the person or not? Is it literally just one by one? Or do you have like a special checkered out? We're only focused on the people who are following us in this case. So what you would do is however many people are following you, a minus 10 and a half thousand, right? So I would literally just click on that number and I would just scroll through the list. And we have a tracker. It's a big really, I kind of lovingly say it. It's a very sexy Excel spreadsheet, but really it's just a big Excel spreadsheet. But it's all color coded and pretty and what I were right. But on Monday, you're going to end up adding anybody that you interact with. You're going to add their name to that list. And then you have a tab specifically for it that will grow. Because obviously you're not going to be able to interact with every single person that's following you every Monday. It's not reality. The reason and the reason that we're interacting with our followers content is the people that follow us is because they are going to notice that we're interacting and we're talking about engagement, like writing comments on their posts, maybe sending them a would a DM category or a cuss fight or okay. So any content, any contact with their content or themselves? Yeah. And keep in mind, right? Like if somebody starts following you and you don't know them, they obviously are following you for reasons. Something created the desire and the other individual to start following you. But if you don't show up for them in any form of reengage, right? Meaning if you start following me, DJ, and I just let it go and I just never go to your profile and engage back with you, you're sort of kind of a lurker follower and you're like, oh, I'm following Michelle, but no, I don't really know her. And eventually you might stop following me all together, right? So how do we create a stick factor? And then how do we create an opportunity to have a conversation with someone as it's happening, sort of striking while the iron is hot, if you will, or the concept of that when someone starts to consume us. Now we're not saying to somebody like, if you start following me right now, I'm not going to go and send you a DM and say, hey, thanks so much for following me. Like, absolutely not. We're not going to do that. We're going to engage like a normal human. We're going to go look at your content. See if you posted something that I can resonate with and then I'm going to re I'm going to react or respond to that. Yeah, I think you were you brought up a really good point. So what we're what you just talked about is the dreaded linked in connection. Because what happens sometimes when we accept a fri- Yeah, we know this. You accept a fri- you accept somebody. I don't know what they call a theme or connections, I think, in LinkedIn when you accept a connection friend, so to speak. You know, sometimes you instantly get those automatic DMs inside of LinkedIn saying like, oh, by the way, I want to sell you X, Y or Z or be your service provider and nobody likes that. Literally. So if you if someone follows you, don't just write them a DM. Thanks for following me. Would you like, do you need a REALTOR? That is not how humans interact and it is not how people- I mean, maybe once in a out of a thousand, you might get lucky, but everyone else will just be turned off because that's not you haven't demonstrated that you are interested in getting to know that person at all. Well, and that ties into the second big mistake that from your original question. We just magically got to this place where I feel like it's perfect to bring this up. Don't have an automated message in your DMs. Yes. And I get so many of them, right? Like if I and I just got one right now while you and I are recording live, I got one where I sent a message a while back and literally just got an auto responder. So she obviously has mini chat or something timed to send an auto responder at a certain time. Some people have them set automatically. So as soon as they get a message, they automatically send out an auto responder. So for context, right? Let's say, for example, DJU posts in your stories a picture of you holding a Dutch Rose that you went and got in the morning on your way to work, right? And I comment or engage back in that via story reply, AKDN, right? So if I respond to your story and I say, Oh my gosh, I'm a huge Dutch profan, I have recently been getting the protein coffee. What did you order? Question mark, send, and you then have an auto responder that kicks back and says, thanks so much for reaching out for to me for all your real estate needs. Here's my self-one number. Please call me like I'm instantly turned off. And I'm definitely not responding to you. But even more important than that, you are not going to ever see my message, right? Because now Instagram's not going to tell you that you have an unwritten message, right? So the amount of time that's going to lapse between you even seeing that there was that message from me in the first place to you responding to me is going to be way too long for me to be to for me to stay engaged. If that makes sense. It's totally. Yeah, it's interesting. And I also think too that in this as a man, I can only think about this from my perspective and maybe the male perspective is, you know, there is such a thing as called sliding into someone's DM. So as men, male REALTORS, we should be mindful of that, you know, it's been particular females like us. It never happens to me. I never get any unsolicited, sort of romantic things inside of Instagram, but women do. And so can we just really quickly talk about if we're going to DM somebody who follows us and we're not as familiar with them, we're going to send them, you know, hey, I saw you got this coffee or got this thing and I'm really into the same thing. How do we do that in a way that doesn't come off as flirtatious or non-professional? Do you have any just general guidelines there as a woman who probably gets those kind of messages that dissolve the thing? Yeah, unfortunately, I do. And when my husband and I first got married, we're actually about to celebrate five years, but when my husband and I very first got married, I always make fun of it together. Like I would get the messages and then I'd run into the other room and show them and he would respond and it would just be fun. But now it's not as funny anymore because I'm a mom and, you know, I'm very happily married and it's sort of just annoying. But here's the thing I will say is when I can very quickly tell intuitively when it's a message that is worthy of my response, right? So if someone just says hi, hi, and that's it, not responding. Right? If someone is sending me a message saying hi, beautiful, did it at all of this, obviously not responding, right? If someone says hi, do you have a few moments for us to chat, not responding to that? Yeah, that's the way I hate that one too. Hi, Michelle. Do you have room in your day to take on more clients? Like obviously you didn't look at my profile. Like if that's what you're right. So I think the number one thing I can tell every single one of you guys that are listening to this of how to how to deal with that is use your intuition, right? Men have it, women have it, we have different versions of the same intuition, but you can tell, right? And my pet peeve, if you will, is when a lot of the older generation will say, well, I just don't want to, I don't know, so I just respond to all of them. I'm like, no, just because I'm 33 and year 50 doesn't mean that at 50, I'm not going to have the same intuition that I currently have, right? So I think it's just a matter of like using your intuition and allowing. Using your best judgment. Yeah. And also as as men understanding, we don't get those kind of messages, but women do. So being extra mindful, I mean, literally, I've never once gotten one of those messages, but which is, which, you know, is just the different experiences that men and women have. I think it all depends on how you initially engage, right? And what you say on your side. And so there's some message structure that we teach, I'll give you, give it to you very quickly, but story replies when you're doing a story reply, it's designed to be in three parts. Now, any of you guys have ever read what to say or the art of conversation or any of these really very, very good sales psychology books. That is how I formulated all of this. So it's not just theory, right? This is truly like how it actually works on a day-to-day basis. But a story reply in those three parts. So again, all of these three parts is one message, but that one message is broken down into each of these sections or segments. So part number one is acknowledgement. So what is the person on the other side desire by using social media in the first place, right? To feel heard, to feel seen, to feel acknowledged for who we are and what we're doing. So if I'm responding to your story about Dutch bros and I don't acknowledge the fact that you're holding a cup of coffee or that you are holding Dutch bros coffee, I'm missing the boat there, right? I'm doing you a disservice and I'm doing myself a disservice in trying to build our relationship. So acknowledgement first. So I'm going to acknowledge quite literally, hey, it's awesome that you got Dutch bros. I'm a huge Dutch bros fan too. Then part number two to the message comes in, which is subliminal business play. So this has been tried and tested over and over and over again. And the best way to do this is to tie it into your clients or the fact that you have clients or the fact that you're actively working. So what would that sound like for you, right? Like, and let's pretend I am the real estate agent, Michelle, and I'm prospecting new DJ in my DMs, right? So I see the story of you posting or you holding Dutch bros. I'm going to say, it's awesome that you got Dutch bros. I'm a huge fan of Dutch bros as well. I've been getting the protein coffee recently. And then the subliminal business play might be Dutch bros is actually my favorite place to take clients for coffee before we go look at houses. That's my subliminal business play. So I'm not pro or I'm not selling them directly, right? I'm simply acknowledging the fact and bringing to light subliminal the fact that I have clients, right? Yeah. So you're telling instead of selling, you're basically talking about an experience that's related to your business without saying, and you might be the next person that I want to take to you're just saying, oh, hey, I love Dutch bros. I take all of my clients there before we go. I'm so glad to see another Dutch brother fan out there or whatever. And then the third part is ending it in the question, right? Ending it in the form of a question. So my final segment to that message that I'm sending you would be something like, what's your go to order at Dutch bros or how often are you stopping at Dutch bros is that, you know, I go three times a week and my husband hates it. Ha ha, right? So ending in the form of a question is designed to get engagement, right? So if I'm ending it in the question I'm anticipating you responding to me. And then when someone responds, so let's say you do respond, my job at this point is to keep the conversation going as long as I can, right? We all know that in sales, the number one thing that we need to do is capture attention for as long as possible, right? The longer we can keep it, the more likely we have the opportunity or we'll have the opportunity to convert it. So my number one suggestion in your DMs is live in the land of curiosity, meaning ask questions all the time constantly, never respond in the form of a statement or something that is a rhetorical question, right? In that sense, questions that are designed to continue the conversation is key because we have to get through the four to seven touch points that traditionally as well. A real estate lead takes anyways to convert in the first place. And there's also transition sort of ways to transition from the sort of this statement about the post into the question. So I was thinking as you were saying that, you know, what I would probably add if the roles were reversed is I would say like, Hey, Michelle, you know, after saying your Dutch brothers, that's awesome. I love Dutch brothers. I take my clients there. Hey, funny timing. I actually am looking for a new order. I'm kind of getting sick of my regular order. Do you mind sharing what you ordered? Would you recommend it or something like that where I'm yeah, and I'm just sort of a little bit more, you know, slowly and gently squeezing us into, Hey, by the way, tell me tell me something about you. Yeah. And I love that. And that's a thing about it is every single one of us, no matter who you are, you're going to do it a little differently. But the beauty of it is that you have to do it the way that you would do it and that there's no magic one to this question is the number one question. If you ask it, everybody's going to respond, right, it doesn't work that way. So being able to just be intuitive, I think is the key and most importantly, living in the land of curiosity in your messages. And I think the biggest thing that I want to make sure we don't miss is prospecting is not if I get to it, I'll get to it type of situation, right, especially when it comes to Instagram. So I prospect on Instagram every single day. I don't prospect in the form of cold calling at all anymore zero. I haven't had the cold calling years. I'm very grateful for that. But and if you're listening to this and you do cold call, that's you keep doing it, right, but designate a time of your day or time block it, which is I think the phrase that most people use, right, time block a hour of prospecting in your morning or in your afternoon, or if you don't have a solid hour, you can designate. Maybe it's a little bit in the morning and a little bit at night, right? But it has to be a non-negotiable. And I think that that's the problem with with Instagram right now is people are seeing it as if I if I have time, I'll get to it when I get to it versus this is an opportunity for me to truly never have to cold call again if I do it right because I can build a relationship digitally first, work through the touch points and then get on the phone with them. Hello, never having that weird gross cold call feeling ever again. That's super intrusive. Feels very invasive. You're catching them at the wrong time. They're like, why are you calling me? Who are you? I've already talked to five other REALTORS, right? Like we want to avoid all of that. And so avoiding that feeling is literally why I developed the prospecting part of the Instagram platform the way that we do it. Because I know how that felt many, many years ago and it's awful. I don't know anybody that enjoys getting on the phone. No, it's terrible. So Monday is for reaching out to our followers and initiating some sort of interest in their activities, their passions, and seeing if a conversation emerges from there at the very least, even if it doesn't, what we're doing is demonstrating care and that we're interested in someone else and that we're paying attention, which is one of the most flattering things that any human can experience is somebody paying attention to them. Like you said, being seen, being heard, most importantly being acknowledged. And that's through the content or the comments or the DM is, hey, I saw you did this thing awesome. That's really cool. What do we do on Tuesdays? So Tuesdays and thank you for pushing us along there. I tend to go on tangents when I kept asking. No, no, no, I could talk about I could talk about it for hours and I'm like, I got I better remember. Yeah. Anyway, yeah. Tuesdays and Thursdays are actually the same. So well, they typically have different categories, but the theory behind Tuesdays and Thursdays is the same. So what Tuesdays and Thursdays are is when you're not at home or when you're not where do you go? What hobbies do you have that you could potentially be having conversations with individuals about real estate? And I have a client. I'm going to use her as an example. She is a plant lady, hardcore plant lady. Every closing gift for every client is a really beautiful real plant. Right? I told her I was like, I can never hire you to be my REALTOR because I will kill the plant. But I love it. I love plants. I have green plants all over my house that most of them are not real. But when she brought that up in that context, she was like, well, how do I add? How do I make that a category where I can talk to other people about plants on Instagram and have it be in my area? Right? And she was shocked at how fast I was able to find 50. Oh, it's so easy. There's a yeah, you could go to any any florist. You could go to any plant person that's local. You could you could say, Hey, let's jump on an Instagram live. I'll promote your business. You promote we can talk about real estate and talk about plants. I'm just throwing this idea. Oh, and you're doing my job for me. Like that's exactly what the idea behind it is. So when it comes to finding them, right? Like we did this together on a Zoom meeting her and I literally googled plant shops in her area. She actually she happens to live in Connecticut. But so we googled plant shops and the only thing that really came up was home Depot and lows and we're like, no, no, no, no, right? So what I showed her was a trick that you can do on Instagram. And I said, Sarah, go find your plant shop that you go to on Instagram. She's like, Oh, I already know their account. So she goes to their account. And then in their profile, if you see the contact button and then right next to the contact button, there's this little tiny button that's a person with a plus sign. And if you click on that, it's going to give you this huge drop down of suggested accounts that Instagram is saying that based off of following this plant shop, you might like all of these, right? And we went through all of those so many of them were either other little plant shops, coffee shops that also sold plants in her area, bloggers that blogged about plants in her area. I mean, like the list was endless. And she was like, Michelle, my town is so small. How is this even a thing? And I'm like, thank you, Instagram, because you just created a community for yourself in your hyper local market, right? And I really want to hit on that in your hyper local market. Yeah, we're not finding plant shops from all over the country, which anybody could do. And that doesn't really necessarily speak to the local community. Correct. Right. But like Instagram, if by using that suggested button, right? Instagram is literally giving you what you are asking for, right? Which is I want to find other people who are into plants and other plant shops or other bloggers or whatever in my area. So to go back to your original question and to keep the flow and the tracker happening Tuesdays and Thursdays are designed to be these types of days, right? So you're focused on hobbies specifically or things that you enjoy outside of work. Now this could be at home, right? You could I have a client who's really in a home setting, right? If that's you, there's a whole community for that on Instagram. If you're into like knitting or arts and crafts or if you're a mom, right? I have a hockey mom client that I adore her. And she's like, Michelle, I don't do anything other than go to hockey like every single day we go to hockey. And I was like, that's a day on your tracker because all of the different arenas that your sons play in, all of the different teams that have their own Instagram accounts, all of the different small businesses that support the hockey community, AK cell hockey stuff, all of the coaches that have their own Instagrams, right? The list goes on and on and the beautiful thing about all of this. So Tuesdays and Thursdays, you can have different categories for each of the days, right? So if you have multiple hobbies or multiple different things, but the idea behind Tuesdays and Thursdays is that you are talking to people about things that you also share a passion for or an interest in. And if I'm commenting on, if I'm my client that's a hockey mom, right? If I'm client, if I'm sorry, if I'm commenting on hockey teams post about them winning a game or winning a match, right? Guess who's going to see my comment? All of the other moms are all of the other people that are into the hockey that are probably following that Instagram account. And the idea is that they are going to see my comment, they're going to see my interaction. They're going to click on my profile, go and see if you're doing it, right? That you are posting about hockey and that you're posting about your kids being interested in hockey too. And now there's this connection and then this subliminal part of that happens, which is we're showing all of our real estate content. We're showcasing our credibility through our testimonials and all these other things. But the connection is initially made via mutual shared passion or interest. Love it. So we're finding local people as best we can in our community. And just that little tip, that really cool tip that I did not know about is look for the little I so look for an account of a business or a page that that you're you know Instagram account that you're into that shares your one of your passions. And then you can see a little icon you click on that and it will show you suggested accounts that are very similar. And you can start looking to see if you can find also you can other find other accounts in the area. You can also there are Instagram you know there's search functionality too and Instagram and so you could also start searching via certain hashtags and obviously look for hyper local things like if you're if you want to find we do this here in Chicago a lot where there's so many different neighborhoods and suburbs that there's all these you know for example mom groups that talk about activities for children very common. And you know there's certain hashtags for that and you know etc. So okay so Tuesdays yeah the tracker the tracker when you build it out and thank you for saying all that because you again you're doing my job for me DJ good job. But uh the the tracker when it's built out right you have it broken into three categories. So you have hashtags accounts in geotags and each of your days of the week is separated that way with the exception of Mondays and Fridays. Mondays Wednesdays and Fridays which we'll talk about here in a second but so Tuesdays and Thursdays you have hashtags you have accounts you have geotags and then we teach a trick called the wormhole effect which is simply if you click on one of those hockey pages for example you find the hockey arena that your kid plays out consistently and you click on their most recent piece of content let's say they have 30 likes if you click on the people who liked it you then start interacting with those individuals right so that's the wormhole effect with the idea behind that being you're connecting with more and more people that are actively using the page or consuming the page and just getting your name exposed to those who are interested in the same thing in your area so. So quick question about that so you just said something very powerful so again let's say we're we're our passion is being a hockey mom and we are looking at the account for the the the rink the the arena that our our child plays at and we see all of the other you know hockey moms that might be following that Instagram account how do you encourage people to interact because this is going to be people that don't know you but that have a shared interest you're both into hockey being hockey mom and you're going to the arena what would you say is a great point of engagement how do you how do you sort of initiative. It goes back to the exact same the same methodology right so the same three prong initial response which is acknowledgment supplemental business play and then in the form of a question now if that's for story replies right or DMs story reply and DM is the same thing for those of you guys listening that don't know the the terminology they are the same right so if you're responding to a story that ends up being a DM but if you're commenting on someone's content on their feed it's a little bit different right it's a little simpler you don't need to do a full three prong response but you do need to do it have it acknowledgment right I will tell every single one of you if you are commenting on a piece of content and your comment doesn't stand out to me as the person that produced content or produced the piece of content I'm not responding to you right so if you're like awesome content great photo um this is really cute or your son is really cute exclamation point it's like that's what everybody says right and not to be facetious about it but to simply say in a C of a bunch of comments your job is to stand out so if you see somebody posting um of their sons playing at the same hockey arena that your son plays right acknowledge it oh my gosh this is awesome I had no idea that you guys also play hockey here I've been coming here with my son for the last five years period right um and that could be something that's going to stand out now if you're responding to her story that individual story that posted that photo of her boys in front of the hockey arena and you're like well how do you break the ice same concept right the three promise were apply applies um which is acknowledge subliminal business plan and then the form of a question so your final question to that could be something like um I've been coming here with my sons for the last five years how long have you and your boys been playing at this arena and you can even go on step further like when are you guys there um I would love to like say hi right like say hi yeah you know um but it gets a lot easier when you have that shared connection or that mutual interest and then the thing about that which is funny is to your point DJ which is there's a degree of separation where you may even realize that you already knew that person without even realizing it right so you may click on their profile and be like oh that's the life of this person or oh that's the best friend of this person that I've never talked to right and it becomes so easy to start a conversation um so Tuesdays and Thursdays are that right and I always say it's just think through that and you're everyone's like well I'm really boring I don't do anything no that's not true right um you have interest you have passions even if you don't leave that even if it's a tv show that you watch it I was doing this the other day I was watching um the curse which is a show and showtime and I it's one of the most uncomfortable shows I've ever seen it's purposely written to certainly um activate someone's anxiety and interpersonal sort of challenges it's it's it's really it's Emma Stone and Nathan Field her it's very very good but anyway it's very hard I find it very difficult to watch and there's a lot of symbolism in the show and I go I am going to the Reddit forum or the Reddit group for the subreddit for the curse and there is one and I'm like I think they're trying to portray him as like a Jesus light character and anyway I wanted to see if my theory was was accurate and sure enough other people had the exact same theory but you could do the same thing on Instagram you can say I just saw the ending of episode so and so with with this you could even post content about it and say I don't really understand what the ending means if anyone has seen this if you have you know ideas or you could search for other people's content about that particular episode say hey I just found your content I'm a little confused about the ending uh here's what I think but what do you think I mean it doesn't have to be something you even go out and do it could be something you consume like uh you know like coffee or or tv show or book or anything yep and the easiest the easiest way to do it if you're like sitting struggling thinking of ideas for topics is if you're like you're a Chicago right but Chicago is freaking massive so the thing about that is five subsidies or five sub uh sub not sub divisions but five sub cities within the city so I live in Clarksville Tennessee right but my husband and I live in San go which is a subsidy within the Clarksville zip code but hearing Clarksville if I were to say to a mom or somebody at the gym or whatever oh yeah we live in San go everybody knows what that means so if you go to Instagram and you type in hashtag saying go Tennessee that is going to come up so um if you're gonna do it on a Tuesday or a Thursday what I would recommend is pick your top five sub cities or cities specifically that you sell real estate in or want to um find hashtags find geotags find specific accounts that are related to those cities so here intent or here in Clarksville we have a Instagram page called local Clarksville which is basically the page that shares anything and everything restaurants mom stuff book stores coffee shop everything right for Clarksville and that page becomes sort of the springboard to all these other pages that could give you ideas of who to be engaging with in different types of accounts so um Tuesdays or Thursdays you could just do it what we call small business day which is you're using those five sub cities and then just looking up their hashtags looking up their geotags and then just go into town um so yeah there's uh there's a for example is a jean store I go to that just happens to be a block from where I live and it's really I think probably the only good jean store in Chicago are certainly one of few and they have uh it's tough it's tough out there is a small business owner that all they sell are jeans and yeah they sell very expensive jeans and you have to be into expensive jeans in order to like want to spend the kind of money to do that so they are struggling like every other small business so one of my first calls would be like hey I know there's all other guys like me out there that probably don't even know you guys exist so I want to make sure that people know you exist because I love having you in my neighborhood and by the way I'm a real turn and I do this but what I really want to do is focus on promoting your jeans because I wear them I'm a big fan can I come in and do a quick you know five minute interview with you uh obviously there's no downside for the owner unless they don't want to be on camera um somebody will do it um it's free and you you're gonna tag them they're gonna tag you you promote it they promote it everybody wins you could do that yeah twice a week easy oh easy easy and and obviously the hobbies is the key focus with the small business sort of being that backup to that um but for sake of time I want to give you guys Wednesday so Wednesday is what I call CRM day so this is a very important day that I can tell you right now I've been doing this specifically for Beyond the Method and my program for five years and people still don't do this which I'm assuming that's probably why I'm still a business obviously but um but it's I say that funnily but what Wednesdays are designed to be is CRM day so what that means is you are taking your database and your cold leads right so if you're paying Realtor.com lead still flex leads my lopo whatever red X whoever right you're purchasing data from find them on Instagram and find them oh that's brilliant I never would have thought to do that is such a great idea right so like in your excel doc on Wednesday you have a tab at the bottom you upload the CSV file out of your CRM now depending on what CRM you use like something like follow up boss right for example they will link a Facebook profile to an individual it doesn't link Instagram yet for whatever reason I don't know tell them to work on it but um it'll link a Facebook profile you can go look at that person's Facebook or try to find and see if it's the right one and then cross check it to Instagram now the reason for that is most of the time a person is going to have the same profile photo on Facebook and Instagram that they would on one or the other platforms right we typically do that um that means that you'll be able to confirm or deny this is the same person especially because a lot of people especially if it's individual personal accounts they're private right so in order for you to send or follow them on Instagram you're going to have to send a follow request they have to approve it so if you're going to do that you want to make sure you're following the right person and confirm that based off of seeing them on Facebook first um so on Wednesday there it's two parts right you're uploading your CRM you got 500 names a thousand names whatever it is um and you're working through the list you're finding them on Facebook you then cross check find them on Instagram and every Wednesday you just keep working through that list and make sure that you consistently you're talking to the people that are on that list so you take the first 45 then the next Wednesday you go do the next 45 you just keep working through until you repeat at the top of the list um in the process of doing that you're obviously going to start having a lot of really good warm conversations so eventually that person's going to get moved off of Wednesday onto another day of your tracker aka friday which is what we call reengage day um and I know that this is getting somewhat confusing but visually it's a lot easier to see but um that's what that's what Wednesdays are designed to be the the cold lead part of it is if you get a if you're buying leads in any capacity right the Zillow leads is a great example because when Zillow calls you or when you get a lead from Zillow they're just calling you right like you don't have time yeah live transfer and and know like oh this is mishau for micro calling me this is her Instagram she has the dog she has a two and a like she you don't have that access that fast right um so the beautiful thing about that side of it is when someone calls you like that you get this inbound lead your job as the real estate agent moving on from that or in moving on from right now to every conversation you have moving forward is on the phone with them let's say it's you DJ right and i you and i are you are inbound calling me i'm the REALTOR you're the Zillow lead coming in so i'm going to say hi DJ this is mishau for micro great that you are calling blah blah go into my script right um but then here's where this gets important at the very end of the conversation it is your job to make sure you are connected to them on Instagram right so at the end of your call you will literally say hey DJ this has been an amazing chat with you i'm really looking forward to seeing you on saturday when we go to or xyz property or on friday when we go meet for coffee to talk about your house blah blah right but before we hang up really fast i want to make sure we're connected on Instagram because that's my primary platform that is the primary place that i communicate with all of my clients so what's your instagram account really fast yeah it almost doesn't even give them the option to say no because you've already qualified it by saying hey this is where i communicate most effectively and most consistently so yeah if you know i wouldn't even ask if you don't mind i would just say yeah what's what's yeah like just like you said but i had a i had a client and i'm curious what your thought is on this dj because i had a client who was like michelle is it weird to say that like is somebody gonna think that that's weird and i might have a kid not okay it can seem weird yeah but the way that you said it was not weird you qualified it you explained why you were asking for it and it was a perfectly logical reason yeah so i think if you just said hey what's your Instagram then people can have all sorts of thoughts in their head about why are they asking for this are they are they flirting with me are they you know who knows um but i think by saying by qualifying at the way you did it gives really no reason for somebody to say no yeah you're just having a conversation with someone and you're quite literally saying this is my primary method of communication i know we had discussed meeting on friday for coffee so i just want to make sure we're connected there so then if you have any questions between now and friday when i see you you can message me right perfect so and then once that happens once you start following them or they start following you they obviously get added to your tracker so you can track that that individual is now following you so that you can stay consistently in front of them um because i will say REALTORS are notorious for terrible follow up um i think everybody would say that that they are yeah even if they've been in business forever right they'll say like my biggest weakness is not like closing the loop right closing and working the lead until you get a heart no um and so that's certainly a way to make sure that you can track it but um yeah so that's my day Tuesday Wednesday and Thursday friday is simply re-engage today so what that means is quite literally re-engage anybody that you've had a good conversation with um so if a conversation comes to a natural stopping point which it will they all do normal it's very normal um you simply re-engage them and then the way that we do this as we track and we color code them right so if it's the first re-engage if it's the second re-engage etc we can track that um and then once we've gotten to four or five really solid back and forth and really solid touch points with that individual then it's our job to go for the ask right your job is to get them on the phone attempt to set an appointment um whatever that looks like for you zoom meeting calendar link whatever whatever that is for you um but you have to attempt to go for the ask at that point and then um friday basically gives me the opportunity to stay in front of all of your warm leads and then what are we doing on the weekends or are we taking the weekends i don't engage on the weekends um and that's that's mean personally um i what i tell everybody is the tracker that i've designed is monday through friday um if but it's what i mean by that is it's five days right so it's five days design monday through friday however if you want to do it Tuesday through saturday i don't care right if you want to do it once day through sunday i don't care there's no um better day or worst day it's a matter of like what are the five days for you that are going to make sense um i also know that real estate agents notoriously are the busiest on saturday and sunday so asking them to prospect um and spend an hour in their dms or an hour on instagram specifically doing what i'm teaching is going to be harder right um mondays there's no reason most most real estate agents are used monday says they're admin day or as they're like chill i'm gonna catch up day because of a crazy weekend um so but that's just how it's been formulated but if your schedule is completely different and everything i just said doesn't apply to you as far as days then do it do the five days on the days that makes sense for you so just to sort of recap the the way that i think you're telling people to approach instagram is really as a connection tool yeah not as much of a consumption tool so we're either going to use it to unwind and sort of just have you know entertain ourselves with other people's content but for using this far for our business we want to be super intentional and think of it is how do we find how do i find people who are into the same things i'm into and how do i engage them on a regular basis so that we can share our passions and connect that way and then we can naturally lead that into hey oh by the way i'm a real estate agent etc uh yeah so so we really for the if we're finding people we don't already know we're really looking for shared interests we're connecting that way and then we're moving on and at some point you're getting more shared connection keep that in mind right right um yes thank you because a shared connection is equally as powerful as a shared connection i'm sorry as a shared um passion or a hobby yeah um because some of my closest friends in the industry today right i don't know if you've ever interviewed Kyle Draper DJ but if not you should right but um Kyle and i became very good friends because we accidentally found each other on instagram and we're like hey we were both on the same show and now anytime i'm in Dallas i am always having dinner or meeting up with Kyle we've also spoken in events together we've done podcasts all the things right um and what's funny about that is i'm at Kyle during uh COVID when clubhouse was really big at the time so i heard Kyle's voice went to instagram found him realized we had all these connections and was like oh my gosh i just got to send him a message so i did fast forward you know three plus years here we are um so i think it's just as much about mutual interest or shared passions as it is actual just straight up connections right and what those degrees of separation might be that could turn into a business opportunity or in in your guys' case on the real estate side specifically um elite right like oh you you worked with so-and-so that i know or oh i know the owner of that place how often do you go yeah it's funny i always think about this with because this podcast we interview mostly a top 1% agents from all over the country and i i recruit agents so um if i were not hosting this podcast and some other buddy somebody else was doing what i do i would be calling those agents that you know we're interviewed in my area that we're featured on any podcast whether it's mine or someone else's and be like hey by the way i just listen to your interview with such and such podcast you're exactly the kind of agent we want at our firm if you're ever thinking about you know this idea of you know using media to find people to find prospects to connect is really just the way that we we think of it mostly as a consumption model i'm going to consume others content or i'm going to just post you know stuff about by business um we're not really thinking about it so much in the terms of connections so i love that that's like the major focus for you is how do we actually connect um and let's we want to make sure that if you're loving what michelle is saying and i i don't know how you wouldn't be because that i'm learning a tremendous amount and i've had instagram experts on our show for a long time and i've not learned ever this much before so if you're liking what michelle is saying and you are uh please go to uh please consider investing in beyond the method you can find that at berman media pd that's paul david so berman media pd.com link to that in the show notes of course and learn more about this because michelle teaches all of this and literally gives you a step by step sort of uh template and and an idea of how to authentically connect with others on instagram and turn that into your number one uh prospecting source and i am now thinking about it as from a recruiting perspective for agents about how i can do the exact same thing from a recruiting you know from from recruiting and of course i can there's no difference so i am going to i'm going to consider taking this course but this we could talk for hours more but we don't want to um uh certainly poor michelle is is already giving us a good hour and uh 15 minutes so what we want to do is we're gonna we're gonna end the episode here but guys if you liked what you heard the best two things you can do first of all go to berman media pd.com learn about michelle's program follow her on instagram as well she she dolls out all sorts of great advice and tidbits there that are always going to be helpful to you whether you invest in a program or not that's berman media social on instagram but please consider investing in this program because if this becomes your number one recruiting source um or recruiting i i i'm in recruiting mode so this becomes your prospecting the same thing prospecting recruited uh prospecting mode this is going to be the best money you ever spend instagram is not going away um and this is is still the number one platform that people are are really well yeah it's the it's the number one platform people are using that you are going to want to find for clients it's really the best prospecting tool there is for real estate agents uh prospecting i think i think facebook does it quite cut it for this um facebook's got its own great things about it you can do wonderful things there linked in has some some great things uh but instagram is still kind of the place where you can find other people much more easily than you can in other other area other social uh platforms so this is the the time the 2024 is the year to really get into instagram so um berman media pd.com is where you learn about all things michelle and beyond the method program um guys it's absolutely amazing and the second way is let us know how much you like this episode because we got a lot more to talk to michelle about and if you guys loved this let me know so we can have her back on the show more regularly maybe she comes on as a as a repeating guest so that we can continue to provide this content to to you guys so michelle i will not keep you captive any longer you have been so generous and really spilling all of the secrets uh that that you could in in you know 75 minutes which is really impressive and again that really also speaks to who michelle is as a person um you know these these she gave you really some incredible strategies guys by the way you probably should listen to this episode a second time just to cover go through and get everything and michelle talks fast i talk fast um but she had a lot of great content in there so i'm not saying it to our view count by double although that'd be great for us but really i'm doing it because i need to go back and listen to it
