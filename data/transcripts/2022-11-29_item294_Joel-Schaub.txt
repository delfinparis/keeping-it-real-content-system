[00:01:25] [♪ OUTRO MUSIC PLAYING [♪
[00:01:29] Welcome to another episode of Keeping It Real,
[00:01:32] the largest podcast made by real estate agents
[00:01:34] and for real estate agents.
[00:01:36] My name is DJ Paris.
[00:01:37] I'm your guide and host through the show.
[00:01:40] And today, once again, is our monthly series
[00:01:43] Learn With a Lender with Joel Shobb from Guaranteed Rate.
[00:01:47] Now, Joel is the vice president of lending at Guaranteed Rate.
[00:01:50] He's been doing loans at a high level since 2003.
[00:01:54] And he's got to that level because of what he does specifically
[00:01:57] for agents, which is that he gives back part of his commission
[00:02:00] to the buyer on every transaction,
[00:02:03] making you the agent look like a hero.
[00:02:05] Last year alone, Joel gave back almost $300,000 of his commission
[00:02:10] to buyers who worked with him.
[00:02:12] And that puts Joel's volume in the top one-tenth of 1%
[00:02:16] of all loan officers nationwide.
[00:02:18] Out of, in fact, out of 400,000 loan officers,
[00:02:21] Joel is ranked number 137 again.
[00:02:24] Out of 400,000 loan officers, Joel's in the top 200 agents
[00:02:29] in the entire country.
[00:02:30] Last year, he closed 619 different transactions his highest ever.
[00:02:36] This year, already even in a year, we know,
[00:02:40] is a bit challenging.
[00:02:40] He's already closed 286 transactions
[00:02:44] in all the way through the end of this quarter for $116 million.
[00:02:49] But more importantly than the numbers,
[00:02:51] is Joel's dedication to education.
[00:02:54] The way that he built his business is so simpatico
[00:02:58] to what we try to do on this podcast,
[00:03:00] which is try to educate people so that you can thrive
[00:03:02] in markets like now.
[00:03:05] So if you're looking for a loan officer,
[00:03:06] or if you're looking for a different loan officer to partner with,
[00:03:09] we cannot more highly recommend Joel.
[00:03:12] He's the very best I've ever worked with.
[00:03:15] And anyone I've ever sent to him says the exact same thing.
[00:03:18] But Joel can be reached by the way.
[00:03:20] He can reach out to him by emailing
[00:03:21] at JoelAtRate.com, J-O-E-L at rate.com,
[00:03:25] or you can shoot him a text message, or call him at 773-654-2049.
[00:03:30] Let's say hello to the biggest Cubs fan I know, Joel.
[00:03:34] Welcome him once again.
[00:03:36] DJA, thanks so much for having me on.
[00:03:38] And those numbers, they, when I hear them from you,
[00:03:42] kind of always blows my mind,
[00:03:43] but coming on each and every single month,
[00:03:47] we really like to give back.
[00:03:48] And we really like to share something.
[00:03:50] If I'm an agent listening,
[00:03:52] that can help us get one more transaction,
[00:03:54] maybe help a new buyer right now in this market,
[00:03:58] help a seller, maybe call them,
[00:04:01] and talk them off a ledge,
[00:04:02] because properties that are selling is fast, are they?
[00:04:06] Right. Yeah, it seems to be that inventories still low.
[00:04:11] Properties aren't selling as fast,
[00:04:13] because of course interest rates have gone up.
[00:04:16] And I think it's important that we talk about this,
[00:04:18] because I know there's a lot of stress out there
[00:04:21] in the industry right now.
[00:04:22] Real tours are stressed, loan officers are stressed.
[00:04:25] And we want to do what we can to alleviate some of the stress,
[00:04:29] and you just keep everyone going.
[00:04:33] I was having this conversation with an agent that,
[00:04:36] and I fully disagreed with,
[00:04:38] and I think this is a great one to see how many of our listeners
[00:04:40] agree with this person, right?
[00:04:42] A little controversial, right?
[00:04:44] And they had a buyer, DJ, and they said,
[00:04:46] well, I'm going to wait until price has come down.
[00:04:49] And the agent fully agreed that there's a crash coming.
[00:04:53] They fully agreed that there was a major price drop happening
[00:04:58] with mortgage rates going up.
[00:05:00] They were fully unbored that we would see
[00:05:03] and across the board drop in prices.
[00:05:07] And I said, I have to stop you right there.
[00:05:09] I'm in the exact opposite camp.
[00:05:12] And I really believe there's only two ways for prices
[00:05:15] and all of the markets to go down drastically.
[00:05:19] And one would be a lot more inventory, right?
[00:05:23] And I said, well, let's walk that line for a minute.
[00:05:25] How do we get a bunch of additional inventory?
[00:05:29] Are sellers going to start selling in droves
[00:05:32] when they already have rates that are locked in in the 2,3?
[00:05:35] No, so that's probably not there.
[00:05:38] Are we going to have a lot of new home start, right?
[00:05:40] With the supply chain issues and the cost of good going up,
[00:05:44] or are we going to have so many additional back homes
[00:05:46] where the supply ends up being so high to drive values down?
[00:05:51] No, probably not.
[00:05:52] Either of those are going to be there, right?
[00:05:55] And then lastly, do we think there's going to be a big way
[00:05:57] before closures?
[00:05:59] All these people that had their income double
[00:06:01] and triple checked by mortgage guys like me
[00:06:04] that had good down payment, are they somehow going to walk away
[00:06:08] from home that they put 5, 10, or 20% down?
[00:06:12] Unlikely.
[00:06:13] So without this big supply, I don't see values
[00:06:17] across the board going down.
[00:06:19] And I explain this and we agreed to disagree.
[00:06:24] But I think in certain markets and in certain individual sellers,
[00:06:26] we will see price reduction and we will see buyers getting deals.
[00:06:32] And that's what I'm really excited for for buyers
[00:06:34] that are entering this market that maybe haven't bought before.
[00:06:38] Yeah, and I think too, it's really important
[00:06:41] that our listeners who are REALTORS,
[00:06:44] who are in the industry take a step outside of the industry
[00:06:47] from time to time and realize that especially
[00:06:51] for first time home buyers, rates aren't really as relevant
[00:06:56] to a first time home buyer.
[00:06:58] Not meaning that they're not important, of course,
[00:07:00] they're important, but they're not at the top of usually
[00:07:03] the list of importance of how to make a decision
[00:07:06] about buying a property, right?
[00:07:08] So if we think about the psychology of figuring out,
[00:07:11] you know, making the transition from renting to buying,
[00:07:15] I know when I first, when I was ready to purchase a property,
[00:07:19] my very first property, I don't know, Joel,
[00:07:20] if you can relate to this, if you had the same experience,
[00:07:24] I was ready because I knew I had to save a bunch of money
[00:07:26] for a down payment, whatever the rates were, they just were.
[00:07:29] Like it wasn't like, well, I didn't, you know,
[00:07:32] and I think most people sort of work that way.
[00:07:35] They're like, they save up for years or however long it takes them
[00:07:38] for, you know, a down payment that's, you know, 20% or less
[00:07:41] or whatever they can afford.
[00:07:43] And then it's just, okay, we're ready.
[00:07:45] Let's figure it out.
[00:07:46] And whatever the rates are, you know, that month, that, you know,
[00:07:50] that day is kind of where you're at,
[00:07:52] because you're ready when you're ready emotionally.
[00:07:54] And I just think, you know, and also 7% rates,
[00:07:59] which is what we're seeing as, you know, a common,
[00:08:02] common number these days, is not the end of the world too, right?
[00:08:07] It doesn't, it's not double digits.
[00:08:09] We're not, you know, oh my gosh, nobody can afford it.
[00:08:11] But I just think it's important for people to think about
[00:08:14] like the first time home buyer.
[00:08:15] I know I didn't think about it at all
[00:08:17] when I was buying my first home.
[00:08:18] I just went, okay, I just talked to a lender
[00:08:20] and that's what the rate was, what the rate was.
[00:08:23] If I'm an agent, I need to control the narrative
[00:08:26] because if you watch the TV and all you hear are rates are higher,
[00:08:30] that's what got a lot of people into the market before
[00:08:33] when they were rates were low.
[00:08:35] When rates were so low, people that had no interest
[00:08:37] in ever buying said, well, I better do it
[00:08:39] because rates are so low.
[00:08:41] They went in and they bought places of 20, 30,
[00:08:43] $50,000 over DJ, right?
[00:08:46] They were overspending on the properties.
[00:08:48] And now that there's an opportunity for buyers
[00:08:50] to get a good deal, they don't want to buy.
[00:08:53] Well, let's change the narrative, right?
[00:08:56] You've heard me say this for years,
[00:08:57] I like buying my shirts on sale.
[00:09:00] Yeah, I like buying shoes on sale.
[00:09:02] This is the opportunity for buyers
[00:09:04] to buy real estate on sale.
[00:09:06] If you're an agent and you can teach the buyers,
[00:09:09] there is an opportunity and the fact
[00:09:11] that we don't see a major reduction in prices
[00:09:15] on the horizon because that scares people, right?
[00:09:18] Why would I buy now?
[00:09:19] What happens if the value goes down 20%.
[00:09:22] I just don't see that happening in a major market
[00:09:25] across the board.
[00:09:27] Yeah, I was reading an article today on LifeHacker,
[00:09:31] which I'll try to post a link to it,
[00:09:34] but it basically says what a 7% mortgage rate
[00:09:37] really means for your monthly payment.
[00:09:39] Now, this isn't an industry publication,
[00:09:43] this is just for anyone of LifeHacker.
[00:09:45] It's a great website, by the way, LifeHacker,
[00:09:47] it's a great blog.
[00:09:48] I really encourage people to check it out.
[00:09:50] There's lots of great tips about how to just
[00:09:51] live your life more efficiently and effectively.
[00:09:54] But anyway, they were kind of going through
[00:09:55] the different rate increases.
[00:09:57] And here's what monthly payments look like at 3%,
[00:10:00] and 7%, 8%, et cetera.
[00:10:03] And the article itself is great,
[00:10:05] but the thing I was most interested in
[00:10:07] was the very first comment.
[00:10:09] And I want to just read it,
[00:10:12] it's by a woman named Meredith Deets,
[00:10:14] just some sort of person outside of the industry.
[00:10:18] And she wrote this comment, and I thought it was so perfect,
[00:10:21] because it's exactly how I feel.
[00:10:23] She goes, and I'm quoting her, quote,
[00:10:25] I hope to encourage, and again, this is not the author,
[00:10:28] this is just somebody who read the article
[00:10:29] and is responding to it.
[00:10:31] So I don't know if Meredith Deets is even a real person,
[00:10:33] but anyway, I'm going to quote her.
[00:10:35] I hope to encourage you young first time home buyers.
[00:10:39] When we bought our first house in the 90s,
[00:10:42] the rate on our mortgage was 8 and a quarter percent.
[00:10:45] But we were able just a few years later
[00:10:47] to refinance at about 5%.
[00:10:50] So even if you end up needing to borrow now to higher rate,
[00:10:53] there's a pretty good likelihood
[00:10:54] you could refinance at a lower rate down the road.
[00:10:57] Now that is exactly what Joel has been saying forever, right?
[00:11:01] And this is a good thing to hear from people
[00:11:05] outside of the industry.
[00:11:06] You're not being fed this just from your loan officer,
[00:11:08] who of course wants to keep the deals coming in.
[00:11:11] That's actually true.
[00:11:13] And it's exactly what happened to me.
[00:11:15] When I bought my first place in 2005,
[00:11:18] I don't remember what the rate was for something,
[00:11:20] five something, whatever it was,
[00:11:22] a couple years later, I refinanced,
[00:11:24] and I got a lower rate.
[00:11:25] And then guess what happened two years later,
[00:11:26] I refinanced again.
[00:11:28] It was not as big of a deal because you marry the rate,
[00:11:32] sorry, you date the rate, you marry the home.
[00:11:35] And I just thought that was such a perfect comment.
[00:11:38] I like to take it one step further right now.
[00:11:41] I like to marry the home and divorce the hell out of the rate.
[00:11:44] Okay, it's coming.
[00:11:45] All right, all right.
[00:11:47] These are the highest rates
[00:11:48] and it's a short-term problem, which is inflation, right?
[00:11:50] We know the Fed can get it under control.
[00:11:53] We just don't know when DJ.
[00:11:55] So we can divorce that rate and it's going to happen.
[00:11:59] Okay, I don't have a crystal ball, but I do.
[00:12:03] Okay, all right, so think of that.
[00:12:04] I don't have it, but we know in the industry that the Fed
[00:12:08] isn't planning on keeping rates this high.
[00:12:10] And when they actually say that they're going to stop
[00:12:14] with the Fed cycle of increases,
[00:12:16] the Treasury yield, they're going to drop 100 to 200 basis points.
[00:12:20] And we literally should see these rates go from the 7th.
[00:12:24] We're not going to get back down to the 2s and 3s
[00:12:26] that was during the major problems that we had
[00:12:30] because of COVID, but we really, truly expect the fee rates
[00:12:34] and the 4s and 5s.
[00:12:35] And that isn't 10 years from now.
[00:12:37] That's not 7 years from now.
[00:12:39] Literally, sometime in the next 2 to 3 years,
[00:12:42] we'll see rates that are considerably lower.
[00:12:44] And if you can get in now and buy a property,
[00:12:46] especially if you're a renter,
[00:12:48] and you're in one of these major market areas
[00:12:50] where you're paying a lot of money and rent,
[00:12:52] which does not go down, buy a place now and be able
[00:12:57] to see the future where you can actually get
[00:12:59] a lower monthly payment because those rates will come down.
[00:13:02] Yeah, I totally, a 100% agree.
[00:13:05] I think this is something that we need to be very careful
[00:13:10] as real estate professionals to limit the amount
[00:13:14] of exposure we have to some of this media information
[00:13:18] about rates equal fear, rates going up equals bad.
[00:13:22] We have to remember the economy was in such despair
[00:13:26] and turmoil that the Fed had to lower rates
[00:13:30] to keep the economy going.
[00:13:32] We were at one of, we were almost at great depression level
[00:13:36] with respect to unemployment and lots of issues.
[00:13:40] Obviously, we all lived through that.
[00:13:42] So that was in anomaly.
[00:13:44] That was a blip.
[00:13:45] We were seeing rates, historic lows.
[00:13:51] That is not the benchmark.
[00:13:53] That is not what we should be measuring against.
[00:13:54] We should be measuring against what has the average,
[00:13:58] what has been happening and is real estate professionals.
[00:14:01] We need to look at these cycles and understand
[00:14:03] and have a story to tell.
[00:14:05] Right now, homes are on sale.
[00:14:08] As Joel said, I like to buy things on sale.
[00:14:10] The hardest part about being a financial advisor,
[00:14:12] if anyone knows, if anyone is a financial advisor
[00:14:15] listening or has a financial advisor,
[00:14:16] the hardest thing a financial advisor has to do
[00:14:18] is convince people to invest when stocks are undervalued.
[00:14:22] Like that's a tough thing because you're like,
[00:14:24] oh, this one thing that's like, it's undervalued
[00:14:27] and it doesn't seem like a good investment,
[00:14:30] but it actually is.
[00:14:32] Now is not the time to buy the thing that's up 100%
[00:14:35] in value, right?
[00:14:37] So it's the same option, same thing with,
[00:14:39] you just have to overcome the psychology of
[00:14:42] on explaining to people that it's actually
[00:14:44] a really good time to get in.
[00:14:46] And then we are going to, as Joel said,
[00:14:48] divorce the rate in the future.
[00:14:50] And we're gonna bring it back down
[00:14:52] to a more manageable number.
[00:14:54] I want to pause for a moment to talk about our episode sponsor,

[00:16:12] And now back to our episode.
[00:16:15] In the meantime, there's a lot of buyers
[00:16:16] that would like to get lower rates
[00:16:18] and they feel like they've missed out.
[00:16:20] So we continue to see this reoccurrence
[00:16:23] of this mortgage option
[00:16:25] where we can temporarily buy down the rate, DJ.
[00:16:28] Okay.
[00:16:28] And it comes in a couple of different forms,
[00:16:31] but you'd have to be under a rock
[00:16:33] to not have heard about this two one buy down, right?
[00:16:36] Every REALTOR and mortgage person recently is talking about
[00:16:39] how can I get the rate lower during these next couple of years
[00:16:42] where we anticipate the rate staying high?
[00:16:45] And a two one buy down isn't a new idea.
[00:16:49] It means that for the first year of the mortgage,
[00:16:51] the rate is 2% lower than the current market.
[00:16:55] In year number two, the rate is 1% lower than the current market.
[00:17:00] And then in years three through 30,
[00:17:02] it was whatever the rate that was locked in,
[00:17:04] that's safe and secure.
[00:17:06] And it's not an alternative
[00:17:08] with somebody who can't qualify with that rate.
[00:17:11] It's a way to get the sellers
[00:17:13] to lower the total cost for a buyer.
[00:17:16] So let's walk through this two one buy down.
[00:17:18] And I want to show the strategy on both sides
[00:17:21] because if you're listening
[00:17:23] and you're taking notes,
[00:17:24] this is a really great way to get more buyers.
[00:17:26] And it's also a great way to get your seller
[00:17:29] to sell without making another price cut.
[00:17:32] Okay.
[00:17:33] So a two one buy down, right now,
[00:17:36] even though the market, everybody is saying rates
[00:17:38] that are in the seven,
[00:17:40] it's not that hard with a 20% down payment.
[00:17:43] I had a client that locked in this morning
[00:17:45] at 6.75, we just shopped it around and got a good rate.
[00:17:49] But from there, we took a seller credit
[00:17:53] and we drove the rate down to 4.75 in year number one.
[00:17:59] 5.75 in year number two.
[00:18:02] And then going forward,
[00:18:03] they'll have that 6.75 rate locked in for life.
[00:18:06] And we just asked the seller to give a 3% closing cost credit.
[00:18:12] Interesting.
[00:18:13] Interesting.
[00:18:14] So how does that,
[00:18:16] so how would an agent explore these two one buy downs?
[00:18:21] On the buyer side, it's very easy.
[00:18:23] Whenever we're submitting an offer,
[00:18:25] if we ask for a seller credit up the 3%,
[00:18:28] it will more than cover the buy down for the client.
[00:18:32] So whatever bank they're working with,
[00:18:34] every mortgage banker should know how to do this by now.
[00:18:37] Okay, I was doing it back in 2008.
[00:18:39] I was on a big development here in the city of Chicago
[00:18:43] and the developer was looking for ways
[00:18:44] to sell more properties, right?
[00:18:46] Can compete with the building that we're right next door.
[00:18:50] And that's what they did.
[00:18:51] They said, we will buy down your rate for the first two years.
[00:18:55] And so the seller gives a credit.
[00:18:57] So let's go through a scenario
[00:18:58] so that we can put some pen to paper
[00:19:00] and understand exactly how to do it and what it saves.
[00:19:05] And why not just ask for a price reduction, right?
[00:19:07] So if we were buying a home at $400,000
[00:19:12] and the client got a 3% reduction in the price,
[00:19:17] their payments about $88 left per month.
[00:19:21] That's nice.
[00:19:22] But if we drove the rate down for the first two years,
[00:19:26] in year number one, that client's payment is $488 lower
[00:19:31] in the first year, $250 lower in year number two.
[00:19:37] And then again, three through 30,
[00:19:39] it's still at a low fixed rate.
[00:19:40] But by that time, the hope that we could refinance
[00:19:43] that loan, right?
[00:19:45] 
[00:19:46] Okay, so let's take a look at this.
[00:19:48] If I'm a buyer, do I want to save $88 for the next 30 years?
[00:19:53] Or do I want to truckload all of that interest
[00:19:55] and drive the rate down?
[00:19:57] Do I want a lower rate?
[00:19:58] Of course, I do.
[00:19:59] Yeah, I want a lower rate.
[00:19:59] So if I just get that 3% credit from the seller,
[00:20:03] all I'm getting in terms of a price reduction
[00:20:06] on saving $88 if it's just coming off the price.
[00:20:10] But if I get that in form of a dollar credit,
[00:20:13] the mortgage broker can do a 2-1 buy down.
[00:20:16] And it's just a temporary rate reduction
[00:20:19] for the first two years.
[00:20:20] And that literally saves them hundreds of dollars
[00:20:25] because we're front loading the savings
[00:20:26] in the time that we need it the most, DJ.
[00:20:29] That is a really smart strategy.
[00:20:33] So 2-1 buy downs is what we're talking about
[00:20:36] with a seller credit.
[00:20:38] And wow, you're blowing my mind right now with that.
[00:20:42] I actually have all these ideas of thoughts
[00:20:45] about how to start marketing that to our agents.
[00:20:49] But for our listeners, if they wanted to learn
[00:20:53] more of these creative strategies
[00:20:55] and they want to partner with a lender
[00:20:57] who brings ideas like this to the table,
[00:20:59] which by the way, for everyone listening,
[00:21:02] this is what you should be pushing your partners to do.
[00:21:06] Right?
[00:21:06] Right now, you should be pushing them to say,
[00:21:08] how do I talk to buyers?
[00:21:10] How do I talk to sellers?
[00:21:11] Joel just gave you a great option
[00:21:13] for people that are struggling right now
[00:21:15] with the high interest rates, talking about.
[00:21:18] Actually, he's given many different options
[00:21:20] over the course of all the episodes he's done with us.
[00:21:23] But this is a great opportunity to reevaluate
[00:21:26] your relationships you have with specifically
[00:21:29] with loan officers.
[00:21:30] There's a lot of loan officers out there.
[00:21:31] There aren't a lot of loan officers
[00:21:33] who are going to consistently bring ideas
[00:21:35] like this to the table.
[00:21:36] But Joel, I also know that you are partnering
[00:21:38] with a lot of REALTORS right now
[00:21:40] and helping them build their business
[00:21:42] even through these stressful times.
[00:21:46] So if anyone out there is thinking about re-evaluating,
[00:21:49] seeing what other loan officers offer,
[00:21:52] what's the best way that they should reach out to you?
[00:21:55] Well, the last time I announced this,
[00:21:56] I was actually overwhelmed by the number of emails
[00:21:59] that I got wanting to be added to the marketing list.
[00:22:01] So I have a weekly newsletter
[00:22:03] that breaks this down into plain English
[00:22:07] and helps agents actually have some digestible talking points
[00:22:11] so that you don't need to know everything, dammit.
[00:22:13] You just need to know enough where you can educate buyers
[00:22:16] and educate your sellers without getting into
[00:22:18] all of the deep jargon, right?
[00:22:22] So the last time I did it,
[00:22:23] I think I had about 200 replies.
[00:22:25] It was absolutely my inbox was full.
[00:22:28] And so yeah, you can email me and get added
[00:22:30] to the weekly newsletter.
[00:22:32] It's Joel, J-O-E-L, at rate.com.
[00:22:38] And that's my guaranteed rate email address
[00:22:40] where I will reply.
[00:22:42] And I'll add you to the weekly newsletter
[00:22:44] so that you can get the tips and the tricks.
[00:22:48] And especially if you're a newer agent,
[00:22:50] you need some good talking points
[00:22:52] and you need to work with somebody
[00:22:54] in your local market too.
[00:22:55] It's not just me,
[00:22:56] you find a mortgage professional that wants to give to you,
[00:23:00] wants to meet with you,
[00:23:02] wants to really spend money on you, okay?
[00:23:04] There are a lot of respite compliant ways
[00:23:07] that a mortgage professional can help a REALTOR
[00:23:10] and that's how all my relationships are built
[00:23:12] is finding ways to give back, okay?
[00:23:15] If you do have a buyer that you need help with,
[00:23:18] you can also email me and that same email
[00:23:20] and say send me your lender in production template.
[00:23:24] And I'll be happy to work with the buyer,
[00:23:27] get them pre-approved,
[00:23:29] and then give back part of my commission,
[00:23:31] which is $1,500 to the buyer.
[00:23:34] It makes you look good
[00:23:35] and then we can work together
[00:23:36] on some transactions for sure.
[00:23:39] You know, I think that's a great idea.
[00:23:41] I hope everyone reaches out to you
[00:23:43] and joins your mailing list,
[00:23:44] your weekly mailing list
[00:23:45] because they're gonna get these ideas
[00:23:47] like the one you share today with the 2-1 buy down.
[00:23:50] I also just wanna throw a last minute idea on there
[00:23:53] and this is something that Joel and his team can help with
[00:23:57] and other loan officers can as well
[00:23:59] if you're not able to work with Joel.
[00:24:01] But this is a great time right now to start doing
[00:24:05] first time home buyer webinars, seminars.
[00:24:08] This is these are guys,
[00:24:10] these are the people that don't care about rates.
[00:24:13] If there's anyone out there that doesn't,
[00:24:15] it's not that they don't care about rates.
[00:24:17] They don't care as much about rates
[00:24:19] as the person who's buying their second third, fourth home.
[00:24:22] Right?
[00:24:23] These are people that I've saved.
[00:24:25] They're so excited.
[00:24:26] They need guidance.
[00:24:27] You can partner with someone like Joel
[00:24:30] to help you put these together.
[00:24:32] I know so many people we've interviewed on this show
[00:24:34] have built entire careers as REALTORS
[00:24:38] for just hosting, you know,
[00:24:41] I wanna buy my first condo
[00:24:42] or I wanna buy a first property.
[00:24:44] You can start doing that on social media
[00:24:46] and other places and partnering up
[00:24:48] with a loan officer like Joel is a great idea.
[00:24:50] Joel, you do a ton of these.
[00:24:52] And we're doing them via Zoom.
[00:24:54] We're doing them in person.
[00:24:55] It's a really great way, especially when you say
[00:24:57] they don't care about rate,
[00:24:58] I'd rephrase it in this way is that.
[00:25:00] Yeah, I would use Google.
[00:25:02] Yeah, but they're not dependent on it.
[00:25:05] If I'm paying rent, I'm paying 100% of that rent
[00:25:09] in a form of interest, right?
[00:25:11] Right.
[00:25:11] All of it is out the window where the rate of mortgages
[00:25:15] is a 7% that the heck of a lot lower than 100%
[00:25:19] going out the window.
[00:25:21] So we can educate and teach and we wanna buy something
[00:25:24] when rates are higher simply because we have the ability
[00:25:27] to refinance it down the road.
[00:25:29] And there's a lot less competition to go buy a home right now
[00:25:32] and over the next 12 to 24 months,
[00:25:35] then we had the competition when rates were at two
[00:25:38] or three percent.
[00:25:39] You couldn't even get your foot in the door.
[00:25:41] So now there's an opportunity to slow down each
[00:25:45] and help.
[00:25:46] And the more people you can teach
[00:25:48] and the more people you can help,
[00:25:49] the bigger your name gets and the more you spread
[00:25:52] and the way that you do this would be seminars
[00:25:56] and teaching and education.
[00:25:57] There's a lot of way that we can partner together
[00:25:59] on those scenarios.
[00:26:01] No question.
[00:26:02] And Joel, you've been doing this since 2003.
[00:26:04] Teach, help, and wait, right?
[00:26:07] Teach, help, wait.
[00:26:08] Meaning just can't teach, help, repeat.
[00:26:11] Teach, help, repeat.
[00:26:12] I need that on a t-shirt.
[00:26:13] I love that.
[00:26:14] Yeah, that's it.
[00:26:15] Okay, that's the next billboard.
[00:26:17] You know, I was, I was talking,
[00:26:19] I was telling Joel this offline.
[00:26:21] I was out with a mutual friend of Joel and I recently.
[00:26:26] And we were talking about Joel.
[00:26:29] Joel wasn't there.
[00:26:31] It was my friend and I.
[00:26:32] Talking about my back, right?
[00:26:33] Yeah, behind your back.
[00:26:34] And so if we were saying, you know, it's so rare
[00:26:40] to find somebody who's in a sales capacity
[00:26:44] who has a sales job,
[00:26:46] who actually you don't think of as a sales person.
[00:26:51] Somebody who is legitimately all about training, education,
[00:26:56] and being just a good human being, giving, giving.
[00:26:59] And we were talking about that and we were like,
[00:27:01] isn't it funny that Joel's technically in sales?
[00:27:04] Because that's just not what you think of.
[00:27:07] You think of the guy who is constantly giving his time
[00:27:11] on this podcast, constantly giving to various organizations,
[00:27:15] various charities, various different organizations
[00:27:18] that he believes in.
[00:27:20] And I just think that is really been the secret to your,
[00:27:24] I mean, obviously you're incredibly skilled
[00:27:26] and I don't want to take anything away
[00:27:27] from your business acumen as well.
[00:27:29] But just being a good human being and giving
[00:27:33] has really been the secret to your success.
[00:27:35] I don't want to speak for you,
[00:27:36] but that's what Mike and I came up with.
[00:27:38] I'm terrible at sales.
[00:27:40] I'm better just being friends with people.
[00:27:42] Literally, I like making people laugh,
[00:27:44] I like educating, I like doing that.
[00:27:47] I remember I couldn't even,
[00:27:48] I got fired literally from circuit city, I couldn't tell.
[00:27:53] I just, the people were like, should I buy this?
[00:27:55] I'm like, I wouldn't buy that.
[00:27:56] No.
[00:27:56] And so it wouldn't come naturally to me.
[00:28:00] But what does come naturally is the way that most agents
[00:28:04] that are highly successful have grown their business,
[00:28:07] which is just by the more people you can touch,
[00:28:10] the more people that you can surround yourself
[00:28:12] and give back to, it's that whole givers gain mentality
[00:28:15] that if I'm listening to the podcast right now,
[00:28:18] I'm thinking of the five or 10 people
[00:28:21] that I want to give back to,
[00:28:22] the people that maybe this year lost out on a home,
[00:28:26] they couldn't buy when rates were low
[00:28:28] because every time they put in an offer,
[00:28:31] somebody was coming in with cash.
[00:28:33] Or maybe every time they put in an offer,
[00:28:35] somebody had a bigger down payment.
[00:28:37] And so now these really great couples,
[00:28:39] these families, individuals that had a low down payment
[00:28:43] that couldn't compete, they can compete now.
[00:28:46] Let's go out and help those people.
[00:28:48] And the more people you help right now
[00:28:49] and putting your plan together for 2023,
[00:28:52] gonna really dictate how the next year goes.
[00:28:55] And it's all about staying positive, controlling the narrative,
[00:28:59] and knowing that when rates are this high,
[00:29:00] there's an opportunity for buyers, okay?
[00:29:04] So one thing though, we got sidetracked.
[00:29:06] We talked about the two one buy down and before we go,
[00:29:09] I got to talk about how this helped sellers.
[00:29:11] Oh, I'm sorry, you're right.
[00:29:13] We talked about sellers.
[00:29:14] Talk about sellers.
[00:29:15] Well, you were telling me the story
[00:29:16] about talking behind my back and I had to go ahead
[00:29:19] and I wanted to hear this DJ,
[00:29:20] but on the buy side, it makes sense, okay?
[00:29:23] So we have a rate buy down for the time in which
[00:29:26] we think rates are going to be high, okay?
[00:29:28] So how does this help sellers?
[00:29:31] It really helps them because if a buyer comes in
[00:29:34] and they only want a 3% credit,
[00:29:37] we'd be happy to sell the home at 97% of this today, okay?
[00:29:42] So I can already hear the agents on this, not in their head.
[00:29:45] Wouldn't you be happy to get a full price offer?
[00:29:48] We're three percent credit back?
[00:29:50] Oh yeah.
[00:29:51] It's not that the buyers need this.
[00:29:54] So it's a lot different than in the past
[00:29:56] when we're submitting an offer and seeing like,
[00:29:58] oh, the buyer need the credit to close.
[00:30:02] Maybe they're not qualified.
[00:30:03] That's not the story anymore.
[00:30:05] They're working with true mortgage professionals
[00:30:07] that are talking to them about the 2-1 buy down rate program.
[00:30:11] When they submit an offer, it's just another added benefit
[00:30:15] that if you as the seller don't take,
[00:30:17] they're gonna go to the next list thing, right?
[00:30:19] So instead of doing a price reduction,
[00:30:21] let's work on seeing if we can put it right
[00:30:23] into the agent remarks.
[00:30:25] Seller to pay for rate buy down for buyer, right?
[00:30:29] And you're seeing it in the MLS a lot lately.
[00:30:32] So now that's a brilliant idea.
[00:30:35] A lot of agents don't know.
[00:30:36] They might be hearing this for the first time.
[00:30:38] And if you see that, aren't you gonna be interested
[00:30:40] in the buyers and say, what is the rate buy down?
[00:30:44] So the average rate buy down does cost two to three percent
[00:30:47] of the loan amount.
[00:30:48] And that's the reason why we usually do this blanket 3%
[00:30:51] seller credit, okay?
[00:30:54] Talk to your loan officer about the specific details
[00:30:56] because I could go into full two hours here
[00:30:58] about how it helps the seller and how it helps the buyer.
[00:31:02] But the average cost is based on the loan amount.
[00:31:04] So there is a specific formula that I can do here
[00:31:07] that says if it's a $400,000 house, it costs X.
[00:31:11] It's all about how much the client is putting down
[00:31:13] and what the loan amount is.
[00:31:16] But on average, it's between two to three percent
[00:31:18] of the loan amount.
[00:31:20] So the same thing that I've done,
[00:31:21] and we've done literally dozens of these in the last quarter
[00:31:25] is get a seller credit for three percent,
[00:31:27] trust the mortgage professional and ask questions
[00:31:30] so that you're making sure that you're taking care of.
[00:31:33] Wow, I am completely blown away by that.
[00:31:36] That as a marketing guy, that is a brilliant strategy
[00:31:40] to promote listings.
[00:31:42] I have not seen that or heard that.
[00:31:46] And I am so glad that you were like,
[00:31:48] what we didn't talk about, how it benefits the seller.
[00:31:51] This is a great strategy, guys.
[00:31:55] Obviously benefits buyers and it benefits sellers as well.
[00:31:58] Wow, amazing.
[00:31:59] I love that.
[00:32:00] So this is something you can put in the agent remarks.
[00:32:03] You can mention it and it'll help the homes

And now, onto our show. [♪ OUTRO MUSIC PLAYING [♪ Welcome to another episode of Keeping It Real, the largest podcast made by real estate agents and for real estate agents. My name is DJ Paris. I'm your guide and host through the show. And today, once again, is our monthly series Learn With a Lender with Joel Shobb from Guaranteed Rate. Now, Joel is the vice president of lending at Guaranteed Rate. He's been doing loans at a high level since 2003. And he's got to that level because of what he does specifically for agents, which is that he gives back part of his commission to the buyer on every transaction, making you the agent look like a hero. Last year alone, Joel gave back almost $300,000 of his commission to buyers who worked with him. And that puts Joel's volume in the top one-tenth of 1% of all loan officers nationwide. Out of, in fact, out of 400,000 loan officers, Joel is ranked number 137 again. Out of 400,000 loan officers, Joel's in the top 200 agents in the entire country. Last year, he closed 619 different transactions his highest ever. This year, already even in a year, we know, is a bit challenging. He's already closed 286 transactions in all the way through the end of this quarter for $116 million. But more importantly than the numbers, is Joel's dedication to education. The way that he built his business is so simpatico to what we try to do on this podcast, which is try to educate people so that you can thrive in markets like now. So if you're looking for a loan officer, or if you're looking for a different loan officer to partner with, we cannot more highly recommend Joel. He's the very best I've ever worked with. And anyone I've ever sent to him says the exact same thing. But Joel can be reached by the way. He can reach out to him by emailing at JoelAtRate.com, J-O-E-L at rate.com, or you can shoot him a text message, or call him at 773-654-2049. Let's say hello to the biggest Cubs fan I know, Joel. Welcome him once again. DJA, thanks so much for having me on. And those numbers, they, when I hear them from you, kind of always blows my mind, but coming on each and every single month, we really like to give back. And we really like to share something. If I'm an agent listening, that can help us get one more transaction, maybe help a new buyer right now in this market, help a seller, maybe call them, and talk them off a ledge, because properties that are selling is fast, are they? Right. Yeah, it seems to be that inventories still low. Properties aren't selling as fast, because of course interest rates have gone up. And I think it's important that we talk about this, because I know there's a lot of stress out there in the industry right now. Real tours are stressed, loan officers are stressed. And we want to do what we can to alleviate some of the stress, and you just keep everyone going. I was having this conversation with an agent that, and I fully disagreed with, and I think this is a great one to see how many of our listeners agree with this person, right? A little controversial, right? And they had a buyer, DJ, and they said, well, I'm going to wait until price has come down. And the agent fully agreed that there's a crash coming. They fully agreed that there was a major price drop happening with mortgage rates going up. They were fully unbored that we would see and across the board drop in prices. And I said, I have to stop you right there. I'm in the exact opposite camp. And I really believe there's only two ways for prices and all of the markets to go down drastically. And one would be a lot more inventory, right? And I said, well, let's walk that line for a minute. How do we get a bunch of additional inventory? Are sellers going to start selling in droves when they already have rates that are locked in in the 2,3? No, so that's probably not there. Are we going to have a lot of new home start, right? With the supply chain issues and the cost of good going up, or are we going to have so many additional back homes where the supply ends up being so high to drive values down? No, probably not. Either of those are going to be there, right? And then lastly, do we think there's going to be a big way before closures? All these people that had their income double and triple checked by mortgage guys like me that had good down payment, are they somehow going to walk away from home that they put 5, 10, or 20% down? Unlikely. So without this big supply, I don't see values across the board going down. And I explain this and we agreed to disagree. But I think in certain markets and in certain individual sellers, we will see price reduction and we will see buyers getting deals. And that's what I'm really excited for for buyers that are entering this market that maybe haven't bought before. Yeah, and I think too, it's really important that our listeners who are REALTORS, who are in the industry take a step outside of the industry from time to time and realize that especially for first time home buyers, rates aren't really as relevant to a first time home buyer. Not meaning that they're not important, of course, they're important, but they're not at the top of usually the list of importance of how to make a decision about buying a property, right? So if we think about the psychology of figuring out, you know, making the transition from renting to buying, I know when I first, when I was ready to purchase a property, my very first property, I don't know, Joel, if you can relate to this, if you had the same experience, I was ready because I knew I had to save a bunch of money for a down payment, whatever the rates were, they just were. Like it wasn't like, well, I didn't, you know, and I think most people sort of work that way. They're like, they save up for years or however long it takes them for, you know, a down payment that's, you know, 20% or less or whatever they can afford. And then it's just, okay, we're ready. Let's figure it out. And whatever the rates are, you know, that month, that, you know, that day is kind of where you're at, because you're ready when you're ready emotionally. And I just think, you know, and also 7% rates, which is what we're seeing as, you know, a common, common number these days, is not the end of the world too, right? It doesn't, it's not double digits. We're not, you know, oh my gosh, nobody can afford it. But I just think it's important for people to think about like the first time home buyer. I know I didn't think about it at all when I was buying my first home. I just went, okay, I just talked to a lender and that's what the rate was, what the rate was. If I'm an agent, I need to control the narrative because if you watch the TV and all you hear are rates are higher, that's what got a lot of people into the market before when they were rates were low. When rates were so low, people that had no interest in ever buying said, well, I better do it because rates are so low. They went in and they bought places of 20, 30, $50,000 over DJ, right? They were overspending on the properties. And now that there's an opportunity for buyers to get a good deal, they don't want to buy. Well, let's change the narrative, right? You've heard me say this for years, I like buying my shirts on sale. Yeah, I like buying shoes on sale. This is the opportunity for buyers to buy real estate on sale. If you're an agent and you can teach the buyers, there is an opportunity and the fact that we don't see a major reduction in prices on the horizon because that scares people, right? Why would I buy now? What happens if the value goes down 20%. I just don't see that happening in a major market across the board. Yeah, I was reading an article today on LifeHacker, which I'll try to post a link to it, but it basically says what a 7% mortgage rate really means for your monthly payment. Now, this isn't an industry publication, this is just for anyone of LifeHacker. It's a great website, by the way, LifeHacker, it's a great blog. I really encourage people to check it out. There's lots of great tips about how to just live your life more efficiently and effectively. But anyway, they were kind of going through the different rate increases. And here's what monthly payments look like at 3%, and 7%, 8%, et cetera. And the article itself is great, but the thing I was most interested in was the very first comment. And I want to just read it, it's by a woman named Meredith Deets, just some sort of person outside of the industry. And she wrote this comment, and I thought it was so perfect, because it's exactly how I feel. She goes, and I'm quoting her, quote, I hope to encourage, and again, this is not the author, this is just somebody who read the article and is responding to it. So I don't know if Meredith Deets is even a real person, but anyway, I'm going to quote her. I hope to encourage you young first time home buyers. When we bought our first house in the 90s, the rate on our mortgage was 8 and a quarter percent. But we were able just a few years later to refinance at about 5%. So even if you end up needing to borrow now to higher rate, there's a pretty good likelihood you could refinance at a lower rate down the road. Now that is exactly what Joel has been saying forever, right? And this is a good thing to hear from people outside of the industry. You're not being fed this just from your loan officer, who of course wants to keep the deals coming in. That's actually true. And it's exactly what happened to me. When I bought my first place in 2005, I don't remember what the rate was for something, five something, whatever it was, a couple years later, I refinanced, and I got a lower rate. And then guess what happened two years later, I refinanced again. It was not as big of a deal because you marry the rate, sorry, you date the rate, you marry the home. And I just thought that was such a perfect comment. I like to take it one step further right now. I like to marry the home and divorce the hell out of the rate. Okay, it's coming. All right, all right. These are the highest rates and it's a short-term problem, which is inflation, right? We know the Fed can get it under control. We just don't know when DJ. So we can divorce that rate and it's going to happen. Okay, I don't have a crystal ball, but I do. Okay, all right, so think of that. I don't have it, but we know in the industry that the Fed isn't planning on keeping rates this high. And when they actually say that they're going to stop with the Fed cycle of increases, the Treasury yield, they're going to drop 100 to 200 basis points. And we literally should see these rates go from the 7th. We're not going to get back down to the 2s and 3s that was during the major problems that we had because of COVID, but we really, truly expect the fee rates and the 4s and 5s. And that isn't 10 years from now. That's not 7 years from now. Literally, sometime in the next 2 to 3 years, we'll see rates that are considerably lower. And if you can get in now and buy a property, especially if you're a renter, and you're in one of these major market areas where you're paying a lot of money and rent, which does not go down, buy a place now and be able to see the future where you can actually get a lower monthly payment because those rates will come down. Yeah, I totally, a 100% agree. I think this is something that we need to be very careful as real estate professionals to limit the amount of exposure we have to some of this media information about rates equal fear, rates going up equals bad. We have to remember the economy was in such despair and turmoil that the Fed had to lower rates to keep the economy going. We were at one of, we were almost at great depression level with respect to unemployment and lots of issues. Obviously, we all lived through that. So that was in anomaly. That was a blip. We were seeing rates, historic lows. That is not the benchmark. That is not what we should be measuring against. We should be measuring against what has the average, what has been happening and is real estate professionals. We need to look at these cycles and understand and have a story to tell. Right now, homes are on sale. As Joel said, I like to buy things on sale. The hardest part about being a financial advisor, if anyone knows, if anyone is a financial advisor listening or has a financial advisor, the hardest thing a financial advisor has to do is convince people to invest when stocks are undervalued. Like that's a tough thing because you're like, oh, this one thing that's like, it's undervalued and it doesn't seem like a good investment, but it actually is. Now is not the time to buy the thing that's up 100% in value, right? So it's the same option, same thing with, you just have to overcome the psychology of on explaining to people that it's actually a really good time to get in. And then we are going to, as Joel said, divorce the rate in the future. And we're gonna bring it back down to a more manageable number. I want to pause for a moment to talk about our episode sponsor, one of my favorite companies out there, Followup Boss. Now after interviewing hundreds of top REALTORS in the country for this podcast, do you know which CRM is used by more than any other by our guests? Of course it is, Followup Boss.

In the meantime, there's a lot of buyers that would like to get lower rates and they feel like they've missed out. So we continue to see this reoccurrence of this mortgage option where we can temporarily buy down the rate, DJ. Okay. And it comes in a couple of different forms, but you'd have to be under a rock to not have heard about this two one buy down, right? Every REALTOR and mortgage person recently is talking about how can I get the rate lower during these next couple of years where we anticipate the rate staying high? And a two one buy down isn't a new idea. It means that for the first year of the mortgage, the rate is 2% lower than the current market. In year number two, the rate is 1% lower than the current market. And then in years three through 30, it was whatever the rate that was locked in, that's safe and secure. And it's not an alternative with somebody who can't qualify with that rate. It's a way to get the sellers to lower the total cost for a buyer. So let's walk through this two one buy down. And I want to show the strategy on both sides because if you're listening and you're taking notes, this is a really great way to get more buyers. And it's also a great way to get your seller to sell without making another price cut. Okay. So a two one buy down, right now, even though the market, everybody is saying rates that are in the seven, it's not that hard with a 20% down payment. I had a client that locked in this morning at 6.75, we just shopped it around and got a good rate. But from there, we took a seller credit and we drove the rate down to 4.75 in year number one. 5.75 in year number two. And then going forward, they'll have that 6.75 rate locked in for life. And we just asked the seller to give a 3% closing cost credit. Interesting. Interesting. So how does that, so how would an agent explore these two one buy downs? On the buyer side, it's very easy. Whenever we're submitting an offer, if we ask for a seller credit up the 3%, it will more than cover the buy down for the client. So whatever bank they're working with, every mortgage banker should know how to do this by now. Okay, I was doing it back in 2008. I was on a big development here in the city of Chicago and the developer was looking for ways to sell more properties, right? Can compete with the building that we're right next door. And that's what they did. They said, we will buy down your rate for the first two years. And so the seller gives a credit. So let's go through a scenario so that we can put some pen to paper and understand exactly how to do it and what it saves. And why not just ask for a price reduction, right? So if we were buying a home at $400,000 and the client got a 3% reduction in the price, their payments about $88 left per month. That's nice. But if we drove the rate down for the first two years, in year number one, that client's payment is $488 lower in the first year, $250 lower in year number two. And then again, three through 30, it's still at a low fixed rate. But by that time, the hope that we could refinance that loan, right? Okay, so let's take a look at this. If I'm a buyer, do I want to save $88 for the next 30 years? Or do I want to truckload all of that interest and drive the rate down? Do I want a lower rate? Of course, I do. Yeah, I want a lower rate. So if I just get that 3% credit from the seller, all I'm getting in terms of a price reduction on saving $88 if it's just coming off the price. But if I get that in form of a dollar credit, the mortgage broker can do a 2-1 buy down. And it's just a temporary rate reduction for the first two years. And that literally saves them hundreds of dollars because we're front loading the savings in the time that we need it the most, DJ. That is a really smart strategy. So 2-1 buy downs is what we're talking about with a seller credit. And wow, you're blowing my mind right now with that. I actually have all these ideas of thoughts about how to start marketing that to our agents. But for our listeners, if they wanted to learn more of these creative strategies and they want to partner with a lender who brings ideas like this to the table, which by the way, for everyone listening, this is what you should be pushing your partners to do. Right? Right now, you should be pushing them to say, how do I talk to buyers? How do I talk to sellers? Joel just gave you a great option for people that are struggling right now with the high interest rates, talking about. Actually, he's given many different options over the course of all the episodes he's done with us. But this is a great opportunity to reevaluate your relationships you have with specifically with loan officers. There's a lot of loan officers out there. There aren't a lot of loan officers who are going to consistently bring ideas like this to the table. But Joel, I also know that you are partnering with a lot of REALTORS right now and helping them build their business even through these stressful times. So if anyone out there is thinking about re-evaluating, seeing what other loan officers offer, what's the best way that they should reach out to you? Well, the last time I announced this, I was actually overwhelmed by the number of emails that I got wanting to be added to the marketing list. So I have a weekly newsletter that breaks this down into plain English and helps agents actually have some digestible talking points so that you don't need to know everything, dammit. You just need to know enough where you can educate buyers and educate your sellers without getting into all of the deep jargon, right? So the last time I did it, I think I had about 200 replies. It was absolutely my inbox was full. And so yeah, you can email me and get added to the weekly newsletter. It's Joel, J-O-E-L, at rate.com. And that's my guaranteed rate email address where I will reply. And I'll add you to the weekly newsletter so that you can get the tips and the tricks. And especially if you're a newer agent, you need some good talking points and you need to work with somebody in your local market too. It's not just me, you find a mortgage professional that wants to give to you, wants to meet with you, wants to really spend money on you, okay? There are a lot of respite compliant ways that a mortgage professional can help a REALTOR and that's how all my relationships are built is finding ways to give back, okay? If you do have a buyer that you need help with, you can also email me and that same email and say send me your lender in production template. And I'll be happy to work with the buyer, get them pre-approved, and then give back part of my commission, which is $1,500 to the buyer. It makes you look good and then we can work together on some transactions for sure. You know, I think that's a great idea. I hope everyone reaches out to you and joins your mailing list, your weekly mailing list because they're gonna get these ideas like the one you share today with the 2-1 buy down. I also just wanna throw a last minute idea on there and this is something that Joel and his team can help with and other loan officers can as well if you're not able to work with Joel. But this is a great time right now to start doing first time home buyer webinars, seminars. This is these are guys, these are the people that don't care about rates. If there's anyone out there that doesn't, it's not that they don't care about rates. They don't care as much about rates as the person who's buying their second third, fourth home. Right? These are people that I've saved. They're so excited. They need guidance. You can partner with someone like Joel to help you put these together. I know so many people we've interviewed on this show have built entire careers as REALTORS for just hosting, you know, I wanna buy my first condo or I wanna buy a first property. You can start doing that on social media and other places and partnering up with a loan officer like Joel is a great idea. Joel, you do a ton of these. And we're doing them via Zoom. We're doing them in person. It's a really great way, especially when you say they don't care about rate, I'd rephrase it in this way is that. Yeah, I would use Google. Yeah, but they're not dependent on it. If I'm paying rent, I'm paying 100% of that rent in a form of interest, right? Right. All of it is out the window where the rate of mortgages is a 7% that the heck of a lot lower than 100% going out the window. So we can educate and teach and we wanna buy something when rates are higher simply because we have the ability to refinance it down the road. And there's a lot less competition to go buy a home right now and over the next 12 to 24 months, then we had the competition when rates were at two or three percent. You couldn't even get your foot in the door. So now there's an opportunity to slow down each and help. And the more people you can teach and the more people you can help, the bigger your name gets and the more you spread and the way that you do this would be seminars and teaching and education. There's a lot of way that we can partner together on those scenarios. No question. And Joel, you've been doing this since 2003. Teach, help, and wait, right? Teach, help, wait. Meaning just can't teach, help, repeat. Teach, help, repeat. I need that on a t-shirt. I love that. Yeah, that's it. Okay, that's the next billboard. You know, I was, I was talking, I was telling Joel this offline. I was out with a mutual friend of Joel and I recently. And we were talking about Joel. Joel wasn't there. It was my friend and I. Talking about my back, right? Yeah, behind your back. And so if we were saying, you know, it's so rare to find somebody who's in a sales capacity who has a sales job, who actually you don't think of as a sales person. Somebody who is legitimately all about training, education, and being just a good human being, giving, giving. And we were talking about that and we were like, isn't it funny that Joel's technically in sales? Because that's just not what you think of. You think of the guy who is constantly giving his time on this podcast, constantly giving to various organizations, various charities, various different organizations that he believes in. And I just think that is really been the secret to your, I mean, obviously you're incredibly skilled and I don't want to take anything away from your business acumen as well. But just being a good human being and giving has really been the secret to your success. I don't want to speak for you, but that's what Mike and I came up with. I'm terrible at sales. I'm better just being friends with people. Literally, I like making people laugh, I like educating, I like doing that. I remember I couldn't even, I got fired literally from circuit city, I couldn't tell. I just, the people were like, should I buy this? I'm like, I wouldn't buy that. No. And so it wouldn't come naturally to me. But what does come naturally is the way that most agents that are highly successful have grown their business, which is just by the more people you can touch, the more people that you can surround yourself and give back to, it's that whole givers gain mentality that if I'm listening to the podcast right now, I'm thinking of the five or 10 people that I want to give back to, the people that maybe this year lost out on a home, they couldn't buy when rates were low because every time they put in an offer, somebody was coming in with cash. Or maybe every time they put in an offer, somebody had a bigger down payment. And so now these really great couples, these families, individuals that had a low down payment that couldn't compete, they can compete now. Let's go out and help those people. And the more people you help right now and putting your plan together for 2023, gonna really dictate how the next year goes. And it's all about staying positive, controlling the narrative, and knowing that when rates are this high, there's an opportunity for buyers, okay? So one thing though, we got sidetracked. We talked about the two one buy down and before we go, I got to talk about how this helped sellers. Oh, I'm sorry, you're right. We talked about sellers. Talk about sellers. Well, you were telling me the story about talking behind my back and I had to go ahead and I wanted to hear this DJ, but on the buy side, it makes sense, okay? So we have a rate buy down for the time in which we think rates are going to be high, okay? So how does this help sellers? It really helps them because if a buyer comes in and they only want a 3% credit, we'd be happy to sell the home at 97% of this today, okay? So I can already hear the agents on this, not in their head. Wouldn't you be happy to get a full price offer? We're three percent credit back? Oh yeah. It's not that the buyers need this. So it's a lot different than in the past when we're submitting an offer and seeing like, oh, the buyer need the credit to close. Maybe they're not qualified. That's not the story anymore. They're working with true mortgage professionals that are talking to them about the 2-1 buy down rate program. When they submit an offer, it's just another added benefit that if you as the seller don't take, they're gonna go to the next list thing, right? So instead of doing a price reduction, let's work on seeing if we can put it right into the agent remarks. Seller to pay for rate buy down for buyer, right? And you're seeing it in the MLS a lot lately. So now that's a brilliant idea. A lot of agents don't know. They might be hearing this for the first time. And if you see that, aren't you gonna be interested in the buyers and say, what is the rate buy down? So the average rate buy down does cost two to three percent of the loan amount. And that's the reason why we usually do this blanket 3% seller credit, okay? Talk to your loan officer about the specific details because I could go into full two hours here about how it helps the seller and how it helps the buyer. But the average cost is based on the loan amount. So there is a specific formula that I can do here that says if it's a $400,000 house, it costs X. It's all about how much the client is putting down and what the loan amount is. But on average, it's between two to three percent of the loan amount. So the same thing that I've done, and we've done literally dozens of these in the last quarter is get a seller credit for three percent, trust the mortgage professional and ask questions so that you're making sure that you're taking care of. Wow, I am completely blown away by that. That as a marketing guy, that is a brilliant strategy to promote listings. I have not seen that or heard that. And I am so glad that you were like, what we didn't talk about, how it benefits the seller. This is a great strategy, guys. Obviously benefits buyers and it benefits sellers as well. Wow, amazing. I love that. So this is something you can put in the agent remarks. You can mention it and it'll help the homes hopefully get a few more eyeballs and feet walking through the properties. I love that, Joel. Great as always, perfect way to end the show. I know now how I'm going to introduce the show.
