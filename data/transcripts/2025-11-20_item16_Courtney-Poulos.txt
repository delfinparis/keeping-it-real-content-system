[00:01:16] Today's episode is brought to you by Corded.io.
[00:01:20] Are you looking for agents to join your brokerage or team?
[00:01:24] Now, as a real estate recruiter, I can tell you the answer is always yes.
[00:01:28] But most agents aren't looking to move right now. So how do you know who to contact?
[00:01:33] Well, what if I were to tell you there's a recruiting and retention tool powered by artificial intelligence that shows you exactly which agents in your local market are looking to leave their brokerage right now.
[00:01:44] And which agents at your own firm are also looking to leave you.
[00:01:48] Now, I've been recruiting REALTOR's for 15 years and I've hired over 2000 agents.
[00:01:54] I can tell you with no exaggeration, this is the tool I've been waiting for.
[00:01:58] Corded's AI looks for trends across dozens of variables for each agent in your market and shows you which agents they believe are likely to move.
[00:02:06] Not only does it do that, but Corded's AI went and visited my recruiting website and read everything I offer.
[00:02:13] So now when I'm recruiting, Corded's AI tells me exactly what to say based on that agents needs and what my brokerage can offer.
[00:02:21] It even writes emails for me.
[00:02:23] I've never seen anything like it and I use it every single day.

[00:02:53] Hello and welcome to another episode of Keeping It Real, the largest podcast made by real estate agents and four real estate agents.
[00:03:01] My name is DJ Paris. I am your guide and host through the show. And just a moment we're going to be speaking with top producer Courtney Poulos.
[00:03:08] Before we get to Courtney, just a couple of quick reminders. Oh, actually, before we get to that, I have a gift for everyone if you would like it.
[00:03:16] So one of my lovely sponsors granted this to me and asked me to distribute it for anyone that is interested just as a courtesy of being a keeping it real listener.
[00:03:24] If you are looking for some holiday Instagram posts and stories, these are templates you can edit in Canva.
[00:03:33] So I'm going to give you the Canva link and these are awesome. There's literally 60 of them.
[00:03:37] So you could post every day in December all the way through the holidays. In fact, it's not just for the Christmas holiday.
[00:03:42] It's for all the other December holidays for different faiths. So you can do this for all of your clients.
[00:03:47] And it's really beautiful. You can add your photos. You can add your stuff. And this stuff is awesome.
[00:03:53] So the best way to do it. Just reach out to us. Find us on social or message us through our website and let us know you want those.
[00:03:59] We'll give you a link to it. It's our little holiday gift to all of our listeners.
[00:04:03] So just wanted to make sure that you guys do that was available and super excited to give that to you.
[00:04:08] Also, just if you are new to the show, please tell a friend about this podcast.
[00:04:12] We've been doing this seven years all because our listeners tell other REALTORS about it. We appreciate you.
[00:04:17] If you're a returning guest or sorry returning listener or returning guest, we're excited to have you here.
[00:04:23] We appreciate you as well. Keep spreading the word and we want everybody to have a wonderful holiday season.
[00:04:28] And we also want to holiday a great holiday season. So tell other agents about us when they have some downtime.
[00:04:33] They can listen to some of our episodes. All right. Let's get right to it. My conversation with Courtney Poulos.
[00:04:53] Okay, favorite current favorite AI tool.
[00:04:58] My favorite current favorite AI tool is auto real app. Have you heard of it? No.
[00:05:05] So auto real app takes static images and turns them into viral video.
[00:05:11] And while viral, it's like short form video. And it makes it look like,
[00:05:19] you know, professionally done. So I can you hear that noise in the background? No, you're good.
[00:05:24] Oh, you can't. Okay, one sec. No, I can't hear it. You're good.
[00:05:28] Oh, you can't hear it. Okay. No, you're totally fine.
[00:05:32] So you make a static image. You upload it.
[00:05:35] It brings it to life essentially. It brings it to life. And not only that. Like if it's a fireplace, it'll add fire.
[00:05:41] If it's a hot tub, it'll make it bubble. You know, so you can actually add quite a few unique features with their AI edit tool.
[00:05:52] To make it feel even more realistic or warm like I added a hummingbird to one of mine. You can see it on at the clean, close my Instagram account.
[00:06:01] And then I can see it.
[00:06:01] 
[00:06:01] 
[00:06:01] What I love about it is that I'm over it with the photographer produced regular real estate videos, you know, they just, they just are boring to me. I don't like the way they transition. I don't like split screens. I don't like any of that.
[00:06:16] You know, I want something smooth and romantic and kind of gives you a feeling.
[00:06:21] So that's why adding those features like whether it's a bird flying in the sky or steam coming out of a teapot or fire in the fireplace. It just brings the image to life. I love it.
[00:06:33] Auto real app. Gotta try it.
[00:06:34] I have a promo code for it.
[00:06:37] Yeah.
[00:06:37] Well, we will put it in the show notes for sure.

[00:08:55] And Courtney, welcome. So let's talk. Let's get started the beginning because I don't know your origin story and where you came from and where, why you got into real estate.
[00:09:05] So tell us how that all happened. Yeah, sure. So, well, I don't know how far back you want to go. But basically I'm from state college, Pennsylvania, where Penn State University is. I'm an itni lion.
[00:09:17] And I had the unique experience of going to college very young. I was like 13 when I started dual instrument in college. I know. And I just.
[00:09:26] I was one of those kids. I think the teachers all realized that my desired challenge authority.
[00:09:36] Had had to get me out of high school, I was going to be disruptive. I really need to get this one out of here.
[00:09:43] Yeah, they're like she needs to go somewhere where they actually like questions, because you know, in high school, there's still an element of sort of like babysitting in the classes. So if you challenge the teacher too much.
[00:09:52] You get labeled like a trouble student and then they don't like that. So my teacher, my gifted ed teacher, she was just Mrs. Giddings, shout out Mrs. Giddings. So she, she, I started dual enrollment at Penn State when I was 13 by the time I was 16.
[00:10:06] I was full time at University of Maryland and by the time I was 17, I was working in PR. I was an editor at a fashion magazine. I was working as a waitress. I was also working as the secretary for the Capitol Hill women's political caucus in Washington.
[00:10:22] I was just doing too much, which is my nature. And I want an award, the Daniel J. Edelman public relations student of the year award 1997.
[00:10:32] And it took me anywhere in the world. I wanted an internship and I came to LA and when I got here, I was like, yeah, I don't think I want to leave this place.
[00:10:42] To be honest, I hadn't even completed college at that time. I since did, but I was moving so fast through life, like working so hard, so young that coming to LA felt like a great relief.
[00:10:56] You know, it kind of felt like a place where I could breathe. I became an actor. I was a singer. I had a TV show for a while.
[00:11:03] I was in the hospital and in 2000 and I guess it was around 2004. I met my future ex-husband and we were like, let's get the heck out of here. And he was a political theorist, kind of like a philosopher.
[00:11:17] And so he wanted to get his PhD so we're back in DC. And this is the part that gets a little weird. So after nine years of basically being my own boss, even though I had to work a million jobs in order to make a living.
[00:11:30] I got a job for the federal government at the substance abuse and mental health services administration disaster technical assistance center of the Department of Health and Human Services.
[00:11:40] Okay. You were a fed.
[00:11:43] I was a subcontractor to the fed, you know, feds and and it was the most soul crushing heart breaking experience. I was, it was, I hadn't lived that fluorescent light life for.
[00:11:59] I was like, never, ever really. And I'm like, they treat us like children. Like you can't take it. I can't work through my lunch break and leave an hour early. I, you know, I'm like a child, but I'm an adult and I did not like it.
[00:12:11] So I would work really fast. I was efficient at what I did and my boss came over and she said, you know, Courtney, you're working too fast. We need to build a government more hours.
[00:12:22] And I was like, I can't do this. That was the moment. I knew I had to do something else. I went on Craigslist. That was the thing at the time.
[00:12:29] And I found an assistant job to a REALTOR.
[00:12:33] And that is what brought me into real estate in 2005. And I just, it's been a journey. It's been a big journey. And I've learned so many things.
[00:12:44] How did you get, how did you get back out West?
[00:12:47] Well, after, is that the job that you took?
[00:12:49] No, no, after five years, I worked five years in DC, Maryland, and Virginia. James got his PhD. And we decided to move back to LA.
[00:13:00] I had a son and I had no business. And it's actually a funny story that I tell people who are trying to figure out how to get their first client.
[00:13:08] I had no business here. I had nothing. I had no clients. I had some people I knew from my previous life in entertainment. But I didn't really know anybody that would know me as a REALTOR.
[00:13:20] So there was this one flipper who was doing really cool work.
[00:13:28] I don't know, he was like staging when nobody else was and had this very retail surfer vibe about it.
[00:13:37] His name is Steve Jones and his company is called Better Shelter. They still, he still does flips. But anyway, I persistently called this guy.
[00:13:45] I called him over and over and over and over again. I made a spreadsheet of all of his acquisition costs and his sales costs.
[00:13:54] And I tried to predict how much he kind of contributed and what his spread was. So he finally gave me a meeting.
[00:14:01] And I remember he didn't even look me in the eye in this meeting, which was super awkward.
[00:14:05] And I said, listen, I've done all this work. I want to be your dedicated agent. I've been selling for five years in DC, but I have no clients here. I can dedicate 100% of my effort to finding new projects and to reselling your projects.
[00:14:20] And I guess that was compelling enough because one thing that we we miss sometimes in real estate is like, what is the client experience like if he's experiencing 10 or 15 different agents sending him all the same listings.
[00:14:35] They don't know how to calculate which ones are actually good investments or not.
[00:14:38] They're not really looking for the same things that he's looking for. He needed somebody to help streamline his hunting experience.
[00:14:46] And I was there for that. So, you know, that was kind of the beginning of what ultimately ended up becoming at me, our current brand, my brokerage, which has a niche specialty in renovation, resale.
[00:15:00] So we do work with a lot of really great designers, flippers, to reinvent homes, but in a more editorial way. So if you go on our website and you look at our listings, you can see that I'll kind of have a certain vibe.
[00:15:13] That's what we're known for. Even though we don't do the work, we represent the sellers, but I think renovation artists in LA know that they have a home at Acme, like we can support them and fit and finish selection and we know how to source things.
[00:15:26] We have the right stages, we have the right photographers. It's overall kind of experience.
[00:15:31] And that's been an advantage because like you said in the intro, you know, we got to compete against the big guys all the time, you know, I'm the little engine that could always always, but I do think that there's an advantage in that.
[00:15:44] I mean, what a cool brand. You're a renovation. Say that again. What was what do you call it? A renovation term. Thank you renovation resale.
[00:15:54] I mean, that is a, I've never heard of somebody branding to that particular niche and it's brilliant because who doesn't want that on a property that's, you know, however many years old would qualify, you know, in a lot of properties obviously would.
[00:16:09] And what a cool thing that you probably don't have any other brokerages that are that hyper focused. And so that probably just helps the brand and perspective just just oh my gosh, what a cool idea.
[00:16:23] Thanks. I mean, you know, it's a here's the thing that I've learned. Okay. I've seen other people other other, you know, our brochures are like everybody loves them.
[00:16:34] Like people walk in there like, wow, you guys do such beautiful marketing. And like, yeah, we do.
[00:16:40] Because I believe it real estate's like a tactile experience. That's when when it's like you can have a digital QR code sign in. I'm like, no, I want the interaction moment with the person when I asked them to sign in, even though sometimes lately it turns into almost a fist fight.
[00:16:54] But, you know, I still need you to know that I need you to sign in. And if you give me some kind of scribble scrabble, it's my moment to interact with you as a human like, I can't read this John are you trying to get me a fake name.
[00:17:06] Like, that's my moment to show you my humanity. And the more digitized things get fewer, you know, options that are for that. So, so yeah. So anyway, my point and story is I've seen at other people's open houses like they take our brochure and they try to make it.
[00:17:24] Or, you know, people have, I've built a lot, I say built like a lot of people have built their staging brands on our back or, you know, people have stolen clients like whatever, you know, it's all good.
[00:17:37] But it certainly keeps us on our toes. And the one thing that we just never compromise on is the amount of money that we spend on our clients. We spend thousands more, especially markets like these where people are pulling back because the market slower.
[00:17:53] We don't pull back. We still do the full scale marketing press. And, you know, we just know that our commitment to the, to the client experience is higher than some of our competition.
[00:18:10] I hate to say like that could the sound so whatever. But, you know, we've also gotten feedback. You know, the feedback seems to be from people who come to us.
[00:18:18] Like, I felt like my agent wasn't listening to me. Right. And I think that's something we all have to let check ourselves on. So the reason why I'm not like a grow the brokerage type of brokerage is because quality can go out the window when there's no broker to really manage the training.
[00:18:38] And I'm a very hands-on broker as in I'm here for all the questions. And I run a training program at acne too. So, yeah, no, I totally understand that. And as somebody who runs a larger size brokerage with hundreds and hundreds of agents, I will tell you that is one of our challenges is not to be seen as a big brokerage.
[00:18:59] There are somebody's just a number and it is a battle because, you know, we have over 700 agents here and like, that's cool for us from a revenue perspective.
[00:19:08] But we have to make each one of those agents feel so incredibly special, which is tough. And a lot of those agents, thankfully, are so self sufficient that they really don't need so much from us, but those newer agents are the ones that are looking for that development.
[00:19:21] Like we actually have it, but it is hard to sell that to somebody who's not currently a kale agent because they might go, well, how can you guys possibly do that with so many agents? And it's like, oh no, I know it sounds like we can't we actually can't, but, but that's the challenge, right? And so you're at a brokerage, which is, you know, at the right size for what you do and you're right quality does get, get questioned, right? What do you get to a certain size? So I love that.
[00:19:47] Sorry, didn't mean to interrupt you.
[00:19:50] No, I was just going to say every market's different, you know, I will say, I recently on one of my clean clothes podcast interview this guy named Parker, a very cool guy from a company called Housewell.
[00:20:03] And his company has an eash of selling to flippers selling for flippers, I guess, at some kind of a discount. It's a discount brokerage model, right?
[00:20:15] And, you know, I challenged him on the podcast. I'm like, why would you create something where the agents are getting paid a third of what they normally would pay him? Like are you not training your agencies? Like, no, we use a third part of we you show him me for this.
[00:20:32] I'm like, how do you quality, how do you quality control that? Like, how do you know that that agent knows how to host an open house? I'm just going to put this out there. Okay, for a client for a buyer, if a buyer walks into an open house, they have an experience at that open house.
[00:20:49] You cannot underestimate the value of the agent interaction at an open house. It's how most new agents get their new clients.
[00:21:00] And it's one of these few moments that we have in human life, where you actually get to engage with a human being in person that maybe you've never met yet, maybe that wasn't referred to you.
[00:21:09] So you get to to care a little bit more about somebody else. So the reason why I'm saying that is because we do a secret shopper experiment at acne every time we do a training session.
[00:21:20] I send agents out into the field. The trainees go out and they go to open houses. And if if the person asked them, are you an agent that have to say yes, right? But if the person doesn't even engage with them, doesn't ask them to sign in, doesn't ask them their name, doesn't ask if they're an agent or neighbor or a buyer, whatever.
[00:21:36] We make a note of it. So we're keeping stats on this. They each go to like four open houses and come back. So sometimes I have like 30 open house, 30 open houses at all different price points and data points in the city to see how the open house agent is performing.
[00:21:54] Yeah.
[00:21:54] And it's really underwhelming. It's really underwhelming. Like probably seven out of 10 times the agent doesn't ask the buyer to sign in.
[00:22:02] Crazy.
[00:22:02] I'm like, how are you getting feedback if this doesn't sell like in a market like this, we have to do follow up. And I have to be able to say to my seller, people think it's over price or they think the backyard's not usable or something. I need to give them some feedback.
[00:22:14] If you don't have people signing in, how are you going to give them that?
[00:22:19] Even if you don't care about that, what you should, don't you want to lead like, is it no matter what you would want to lead?
[00:22:27] Yeah.
[00:22:28] Yeah. That part two, of course, leads important. I always think when I'm there selling the house, I'm there to sell that house, right? I'm there in my seller said, if the seller's neighbor comes in, I want that neighbor to come in and be like, wow, court me really.
[00:22:44] I was doing a thing, you know, she was selling the house, you pointed out unique features or like, you know, characteristics of the home or the neighborhood or whatever.
[00:22:55] You know, I want every single agent to have a confidence in that environment that would stand the test of the seller's best friend coming in and reviewing them, right?
[00:23:05] Yep. But it's just too small for me or you know, it's just not right. Then yes, of course, you want that fire lead, of course.
[00:23:15] But the art of sales is not in my ability to sell. It's in the clients ability or desire to trust me that I know more about them.
[00:23:30] I know more about the process of buying than they do, I should say, I know more about their experience are about to have than they do and I can guide them. I'm trustworthy.
[00:23:41] And that does not come from being on your cell phone from being like any questions like we're working as a receptionist at a juice bar like that ain't it. It is not it.
[00:23:52] So I was, I have a, I know that some, some places in America have a lot of discount brokerages or a lot of flat B agents and maybe there are places there where quality control becomes a little less important in LA.
[00:24:08] It's the NFL of real estate. We are competing with people who have high volume deals, even though that's just location base. That's like, which part of town did you start working on that, but I digress.
[00:24:20] And then, you know, they have a big social following some people are famous, some people are on TV shows, you know, it's competitive. It's like you got to know your stuff backwards and forwards or you really can't make it here.
[00:24:31] Well, what I'm what I'm hearing is I couldn't agree with, I couldn't agree more with everything you said because what we're really talking about is intentionality and like really thinking about the experience.
[00:24:42] And I think that is the place where you start an end is like the client experience. So for example, I'm in the process of redeveloping our recruiting website for REALTORS that may want to join us.
[00:24:54] And we would I would always focus on transparency with our pricing with with our commissions.
[00:25:00] And I thought that was the most honest and authentic way to go and it really is in a certain sense. But what I wasn't thinking about was what is the experience that for the agent avatar that we want like,
[00:25:14] I'm not going to forget about what DJ thinks is the most authentic and honest, what did they want? What's actually most important to them and what we found since I'm not a practicing agent. I mean, I have a license but I don't use it. But what we found is even though I know hundreds and if not thousands of agents.
[00:25:30] That what I thought they wanted was not what they wanted to see. You know what they what they wanted to see was more about culture and more about the development. Like how do you actually help us grow?
[00:25:42] Because everyone says they did that help you. They have great training, great support. But what do you actually do? They're willing to pay whatever the fees and commissions are. They don't care.
[00:25:51] Now some people do care and those people that's great too. But for the people that we really want that's not their primary driver. It's not cost. We just thought that would be cool. Put our pricing and our commissions on there. And we did that for years and years and that got us to a certain number. And then we finally went, wait a minute.
[00:26:07] Why are we not getting this next level of agent? We went, oh, because they don't want that. They don't care. They want the development. And so we had to listen to them. So now I'm redesigning our site.
[00:26:16] And I really love to get feedback on it for many, but whether you're in our market or not, I'm not using this as a greeting pitch. But check it out at join kale.com. I have removed all the pricing. And now it's literally just here's how we develop you it. And you know this look hopefully attract a different type of agent because of course, you know, we're always looking to grow and expand as well.
[00:26:34] And so I totally, but that's what I had to do is I had to literally do the research and look into what do agents actually care about. And you do this the same thing with open houses like so what you're saying makes all the sense of the world is you want the experience.
[00:26:48] And what is it? What is a good experience? You know, we all know what it's like when you walk on to a car lot, whether it's, you know, a luxury lot or or more, you know, more affordably priced.
[00:26:56] And that sales person comes walking over you're like, oh god, just don't just be be so much.
[00:27:04] It's a retail shop. It's a clothing store. You know, can help you with anything you're like, no, I'm just looking. I don't want to talk to you. I don't want to be sold your bullshit. I don't want any of that.
[00:27:14] We just had that's our natural instinct.
[00:27:16] Yeah, we're selling our I'm selling my condo right now and moving into a different place. And so this morning, just a few hours ago, I was interviewing my fans and I were interviewing four people because we have to do repair.
[00:27:29] We have to rip up carpeting and put hardwood. And anyway, so we had two different people come. They were both seemingly probably the same as far as their abilities.
[00:27:39] But one was really gave us this experience that made us think they cared a little bit more. They were like, let's say, well, here's what I would do.
[00:27:49] Not just like what you want. Like he asked us that too. And then he said, I'm going to give you some advice. Like this is what you should do. And I'm not trying to upsell you. Here's why I'm telling you to do it. And again, it sounds like well, everybody should do that. But everybody doesn't.
[00:28:00] And like you were saying with the seven out of 10 go to open house, I don't even think they think about the experience. They just go, well, I'll just go to sit here. I'm going to, you know, have some, you know, food or drinks or whatever. I'll have some flyers.
[00:28:12] And I'm nice.
[00:28:13] And but they're not really thinking about from the moment they walk in, what's that first first impression.
[00:28:19] Exactly.
[00:28:20] What are the smells and the sights and all of that.
[00:28:23] Yeah, it's so important.
[00:28:25] And it's so important.
[00:28:28] So yeah, yeah, crafting an experience. That is, that's kind of what we're, what we strive to do every time. And, you know, what people do know us to do.
[00:28:39] And but I have a question for you about the recruitment thing.
[00:28:43] What's a red flag for you in the recruitment interview. Like what is something that you asked them and they give you this answer. And then you know, no, you're not right for us.
[00:28:53] Yeah, it's, so that's a great question. So I would say for people that are like super price focused that want like the highest commission, lowest fee and just are or asking for leads or people that are looking for the brokerage to really solve their problem, which if it's a development problem, great, we can do that.
[00:29:15] And if it's a pricing problem, if you have a low commission split, yeah, we could probably beat it. But if you're too focused on that, I get a little nervous because then I think you're going to leave and go to the person because we're not the highest.
[00:29:28] I mean, there's somebody's got higher commissions. I'm sure in lower fees. So we're not going to be that. And also too, it's just somebody who's.
[00:29:35] I just as long as somebody's like, I always ask, what do you expect from a brokerage? Like what do you actually need the brokerage to do for you? Because everybody has different needs. And it's like, okay, we can do that or we can't do that. So it's more about me getting clear about what they actually want.
[00:29:51] Yeah. And figuring it out, can we actually deliver that because if we don't deliver on what they think we should be delivering, they're going to leave anyway.
[00:30:01] And so it's really important for us to get super hyper focused on that before they come in. So it's not so many. It's not even so much about red flags because we're really lucky in that sense where we just don't really get a lot of bozos that come through.
[00:30:14] But we certainly get people who are looking for things that I have to like sniff out and go, oh, we don't do that. You know, because it'd be much easier just to be like totally just come on board. We'll take care of it. And then, you know, think down the road.
[00:30:28] Oh, we don't really want to deal with that because we only have so many staff here. There's 12 of us, but there's 700 agents like we have to be really, really mindful.
[00:30:36] So it's about the experience, though, and I want somebody to come in and go, I know DJ told me exactly how it's going to work. He's going to explain the onboarding. And then he talked about retention, like, why, how he's going to make sure and not me so much, but we have somebody in retention, their job is to make sure that you're happy.
[00:30:53] So that you say we pay that person to make sure you're happy. So he's going to be checking in with you and make sure that you're having a good experience here. So again, we're on the stage with that.
[00:31:02] So I want to talk about some industry news and just get a couple of quick.
[00:31:07] I'll give you because right now, you know, Compass and Zillow are battling heads are battling each other and and the longer heads, I guess, with private listing network and it's very interesting to see what Compass I think is trying to do and what Zillow is trying to hold on to.
[00:31:27] And I'm curious to see if you have a take on how broker should think about that. And then, where do you think it's headed.
[00:31:37] These are all very provocative questions.
[00:31:40] Well, here's the thing. Like, okay, Zillow, I starting again at the beginning of this.
[00:31:47] When clear cooperation policy was announced, I was like, this is a very poorly thought out policy.
[00:31:56] And the reason why I hated it, it's not because of the mandatory entry piece. It was because it had this little loophole for office exclusives.
[00:32:04] Now pocket listings are not against the law in most states, at least not in California.
[00:32:10] So it's not that they didn't exist before. But now all of the sudden, Compass who had the foresight to create something that they could potentially use as a marketing advantage in a very competitive market when people were, you know, 2% interest rates and 40 offers on the table and people are going crazy and they just want inventory that's not available yet.
[00:32:30] And the law, it would like hit a, a nerve, a demand, okay.
[00:32:36] And, you know, office exclusives, in case you don't know are not really office exclusives, it's brokerage exclusives.
[00:32:46] So in the state of California, if Compass has one broker, it could have that office exclusive network could be the entire state of California's private listings.
[00:32:55] And now with the Compass anywhere merger, that could obviously take over and he said publicly that, you know, that's the intention to give sellers the choice to market how they want.
[00:33:08] He also, Refkin also said very publicly to an AR, I'm not abiding by this policy and I'm not going to make my my agents abide by either.
[00:33:18] And I was like waiting for a response because much like, you know, much like the insanity of the COVID era, they actually had agents trying to police agents like our local association had like a tips line if you see somebody marketing a pocket listing, report them.
[00:33:40] So, you know, for a boutique brokerage, like we have 35 agents, you know, it's not we're not 8,000 agents, it doesn't even make sense for us to have a pocket listing network.
[00:33:50] Sure.
[00:33:51] But also does it even make sense for sellers to utilize.
[00:33:55] That's the real question.
[00:33:56] Who wins, right? Exactly. So I just find it really, really rich that if you read the text of these lawsuits that essentially Compass is saying, I can't believe Zillow doesn't want our listings publicly promoted when the whole reason why they're not publicly promoted is because your seller and you sold the seller on this idea of a not publicly promoted listing.
[00:34:18] The hypocrisy in it is just too much for me to bear.
[00:34:23] And when you see people jumping on other sides of it as it's almost like the government shut down, where if you're listening to MSNBC, you would think it was one side that did it.
[00:34:32] If you're listening to podcasters or something, you would think it's the other side that did it. And if you sit down at a table with somebody who's only listening to one side of this argument, you guys will never come to any kind of an agreement.
[00:34:45] Even right now, right now there's a very interesting conversation happening about the 50 year mortgage concept. Okay.
[00:34:51] I would love to know your thoughts on it. I'm having some initial thoughts on it, but Glenda Baker, who's a very famous Instagram video REALTOR. I've met her a few times.
[00:35:01] She's lovely lady. She speaks out of a ton of events. She's kind of the the spearhead of agent social media mavens, right? Like she's she's just she sits in her car. She does a video. It gets thousands and thousands of views and tons of engagement because people want to know what she has to say.
[00:35:19] So she posted something on it saying that this is the scan. This is a trash idea. There were even some agents at my company reposting and saying like, look, it's a scam. It's a scam. And I'm like, okay, it's a okay.
[00:35:31] I I understand why it makes zero sense for anyone to hold a 50 year note.
[00:35:38] From it from a calculating the interest. If you held that note the entire length of the loan typeway, right. I get that. And I can even see how if you're thinking with that same thinking cap.
[00:35:49] And F.A. J. Lone could be predatory as well. Sure.
[00:35:52] 3% down higher interest rate mortgage insurance is at lower credit score. I know the credit score thing is another thing that's going on.
[00:36:01] But but at the time when I bought my first place when I didn't think I could ever buy a place, the idea of actually owning a home felt so outside.
[00:36:12] Like my family's situation and I didn't think I could do it. Okay. It was that first lady I ended up working for Polly who sent me Courtney. You can do this. You can do this where there's a will there's a way. This is the type of loan you should get. And she was like, just see if you qualify. And that was how.
[00:36:30] I ended up buying my very first place and that I then sold for a profit and turned and bought another place and sold that, you know, it ultimately started my real estate ownership career without that little.
[00:36:44] That little.
[00:36:45] You know that that type of loan that low down payment loan with the lower credit score requirement and you know that opportunity.
[00:36:55] I couldn't have done it. Sure.
[00:36:57] So so my point of view on it is it's not going to be for everybody. Okay. Of course not. And it shouldn't be. Of course not. This is in my opinion.
[00:37:10] Potentially a creative short term solution like an arm like an adjustable rate mortgage that has a fixed rate for seven years.
[00:37:18] Like for example, arms in our market are lower interest rate than 30 year conventionals right. So for people who are having trouble qualifying because of the interest rate using an arm when you know that on a 30 year conventional loan.
[00:37:31] The first 10 years are heavily interest loaded. That's also what you get your mortgage interest deduction on. Okay.
[00:37:37] You can do an arm a seven one arm lock in your seven years. Look at the amortization schedule on a 30 year conventional loan calculate the amount of principle that is applied each year and make a principal payment during the life of your arm each year to match the 30 year.
[00:37:54] So then you do have a principal reduction, even if it's an interest only arm and you're getting your tax right off and you can refinance into a conventional loan when your financial position is better and whatever the advantage of a 50 year versus a seven year in this scenario is that if you lose your job or your your earning power goes down, you still have a monthly insure consistent lower monthly interest rate.
[00:38:19] Now, if you're renting, we know that's 100% loss. You might as well just count it as a 100% loss no tax break, no appreciation, nada, nothing.
[00:38:32] So if you're comparing a program that could potentially get somebody in versus a program that will keep them perpetually a renter and you think perpetually a renter is a better idea than you're not following the hedge funds, the private equity,
[00:38:45] the, you know, the people who are who are committed to making a nation of renters subscription based economy where they don't even think they want to own.
[00:38:55] And that is the problem. I'm like any smart creative person who's ever been poor knows that if you need to buy cheese, if you need to buy a thing, you figure out how to do it. You know what I did when I was little I sold bookmarks that I taped.
[00:39:10] I thought I was laminating them door to door for 25 cents. I sold I sold cards Olympic cards and gifts door to door when I was eight years old because I needed a backpack.
[00:39:21] So if you don't understand it where there's a wilderness away, sometimes you got to do what you got to do in order to get in the door.
[00:39:27] And then once you're in the door, you got to put your brain to use and I'm just it's there's something about about it, the conversation that almost makes it feel political and I'm like, why is this political.
[00:39:39] I'm an advocate for homeownership. I'm also a person who came from nothing and understands the value of homeownership and what it's done for me in my life.
[00:39:47] So when I see like this lady today on the comments, you can go to the Glendipigra post.
[00:39:53] She was like, this is the I said something very I'm very calm like about it, even though I'm passionate about homeownership.
[00:40:00] I also haven't figured it all out like I don't think I've sorted through. I understand the foreclosure risk. I heard one person talking about the appraisals, you know, that they might be more stringent with the appraisals because you kind of need to guarantee that it's in a market where the market's appreciating in order for it.
[00:40:17] And that caused foreclosures. I don't understand all the nuances and ins and outs. I'm sure people will be discussing them. But in the spirit of having conversation, which by God, I'm an American, right, and also an advocate for homeownership and also somebody who benefited from creative financing and probably FHA.
[00:40:36] Hey, the man was it was pre 2008. So you could potentially call that predatory lending. There's no real reason why anybody should give anybody alone with 3% down, right? But it got me in, but it got me in. Yeah.
[00:40:48] So when I see she said something like, you must be the most ignorant person I've ever met. This is total bullshit. These people are going to go into foreclosures. It's going to create a whole crisis. And I'm like, OK, I hope you have a better day because we're just having a conversation here.
[00:41:04] I'm just throwing it out there because people seem to be so animated that it's a whole con that, you know, that maybe they're not looking at all sides of it. And that's all, I mean, it could be a con, right, like a 50 year mortgage. What's the benefit lower monthly payment bank makes more money.
[00:41:21] Get so much credit card interest rate is 22%. So what we're talking about 6% but you're going to have an appreciating asset. You're going to have a tax write off. You're going to have the value of home ownership, which improves culture society civilization writ large, like the advantages of not renting away out way.
[00:41:43] And you're not holding it for 50. You're not holding it for 50 years. You're holding it for five to seven years, most likely. Yeah, and it's probably not for somebody a retiree. This is for people starting out. And yeah, they're going to pay, they're going to pay a bunch more interest over time. And we get it. But at least it gets them in the door. And that's it.
[00:42:06] That you know, it's it is it is a it's interesting and it's interesting.
[00:42:11] I think the coupling of the removal of the credit score.
[00:42:17] I think that's also a piece that makes it suspicious a little bit. It's like, listen, nobody wants another crisis. Like I'm very invested in real estate.
[00:42:25] I do not want to see another crisis. I don't want to see a bunch of people in foreclosure. I don't want that. But when people make the argument like this.
[00:42:35] Some people are making on on the Instagram post like, you know, what if somebody loses their job. I'm like, well, you could lose your job today and get kicked out of your apartment.
[00:42:43] You could lose your job and not be able to pay your 30 year conventional mortgage as well. Like I don't think that really matters as much. You know, my your punch is full up.
[00:42:51] I don't really think that's the that's the concern.
[00:42:54] You know, and the other thing to you is and I don't I don't mean to say anything super controversial. But what I will say is in my experience in life.
[00:43:03] And I am not saying that I look I've been laid off where I was a really good employee and I just got a perfect review.
[00:43:11] And they just needed to cut costs and I was an expensive guy at the company and they let me go and it was terrible. But I've been fired places to where I didn't do a good job.
[00:43:25] So I've had both experience. I've also I've also been at this job for 15 years and hopefully hopefully we'll continue here.
[00:43:31] But my point is is that if you're really good at your job and you get laid off or you get fired or whatever, you'll you should be able to find work.
[00:43:41] And if you can't find work.
[00:43:44] That's a mentality.
[00:43:46] You have to build your skill set because really good painters, really good plumbers that good dentists.
[00:43:55] You you you find that they never really have a problem getting clients because I'm telling my 16 year old the same thing. I'm like, look, if you don't want to go to college.
[00:44:04] Or, you know, computer science, which is going to be replaced by AI in a minute. Why not get a trade. Why not learn a trade. We need Votec back in our high schools.
[00:44:14] You know, I'm a huge fan. And plus how many times have you had something leaking or like your sink is leaking or your washing machine is leaking or your, you know, your car something and you're like, darn it.
[00:44:27] I wish I had a mechanic in the family. I wish I had a plumber in the family. So I didn't have to outsource this. I mean, we need to bring that back.
[00:44:34] Well, the mechanic is such a great a great point because when you find a mechanic that you trust you'd never ever question what they recommend going for when all of a sudden, right.
[00:44:45] You're like, oh, that like or good doctor or a good attorney or a good account or whatever good hairstyle is right.
[00:44:51] As it is, I have taken a lot of time to assemble really quality service people in my life, whatever their job is. And so now I don't have to think about it anymore. And I hold on to those people.
[00:45:02] And again, look, people get laid off and it's terrible. And I'm not suggesting it's anybody's fault for getting laid off. It happens. It's happened to me. And it's, but I do know that if you're really skilled.
[00:45:13] And if you're not, you can get skilled. And now we have just access to information where you to be to teach you pretty much anything you need to know.
[00:45:21] Yeah, it's free. But like you can get better at your job. And it is not crowded along that extra mile. Like you were saying about the open houses.
[00:45:30] When people tell me open houses don't work. I'm like, oh, no, I interview people top agents all over the country for the last seven years. Every single one of them tells me open houses work. But you say it doesn't.
[00:45:41] So it's like, okay, what are you doing? And then you find out they're not really hosting an open house. They're just put, you know, they're just doing it. But they're not really intentionally putting it in there. Well, yeah, it's not going to work for you.
[00:45:52] And it's all about just building your skills. And if you build your skills set as also with AI. So I think about this a lot because I think the lower quality REALTORS and I don't mean lower quality that they that they're they're they're just not putting in the time.
[00:46:08] Maybe they have another career or maybe they're just, you know, helping out a friend or family member once once and a while. And that's great. If you want to do that. But I think your your days are are it's going to be tougher for you because AI is going to solve for a lot of the things you can do with the really good agents.
[00:46:23] Everybody I know right now who's a really good agent is thriving. They're crushing it. And it's it's amazing. It's like because they know what they're doing and they care and they build their skill set. And that's like, oh my god, I gotta tell you something now. I got to tell you this thing.
[00:46:36] I'm sure you've noticed. I'm sure everybody's noticed it, but like, you know, on my on my podcast to clean clothes, we go over real estate news headlines, you know, we talk about the articles, talk about both sides of the scenario, trying to do it like a, you know, you know, like a news editorial style.
[00:46:50] Really powder point. Yeah, you know, and then I also have opinions about this. So I declare, you know, like what what what this little engine that could has to say about it and invite people to challenge me if they want to or agree or whatever.
[00:47:08] But I noticed I've noticed so many like I follow linked linked in is where it's at for real estate drama in my.
[00:47:19] Oh sure for sure. It's like they're so underestimated. I try to tell my agent friends who are who are like reality television junkies and like that are agents, you know, you love this like get in here because this is the most under exposed.
[00:47:39] Cady drama filled whatever.
[00:47:42] What's great about it is that's where REALTORS can go where their clients aren't going to see this post.
[00:47:47] Yeah, exactly. Yeah, and it's also I don't I don't understand the algorithm. I have zero idea why it decides to show me what it shows me.
[00:47:55] Yeah, it's really I really don't know. I feel like I see the same five people over and over again, or maybe those are the only five people posting on LinkedIn like nobody uses it, but what some people do.
[00:48:05] And the ones that do are very opinionated, but what I'm starting to see is clearly chat GPT written post content that's supposed to have an opinion, but the way it's written is really weird and it's obviously chat GPT.
[00:48:20] And I'm like, no, this is where you have to draw the line with AI. Once it takes your actual voice as an authority, then we have a problem. You have a problem like, hey, it's amazing for data analysis.
[00:48:32] Be self to check it. Make sure that it doesn't source site like source publications that don't exist, create bureaus that don't exist phone numbers, even quotes like chat GPT creates quotes to justify the opinion you're trying to make it have that are not sort sourceable.
[00:48:49] Like you have to be careful with that. And I saw one gal advising people it can it can like review the legal language in your contract for you.
[00:49:01] Do not do that. In fact, this week I'm going to have a DRE compliance person on the show to talk about the mistakes that agents are using while early adopting AI that could potentially be either a violation of licensing law or could open them up to litigation.
[00:49:18] Because there is a danger in adopting this too fast. But certainly it's good for what it is good for data analysis in investigating like, you know, putting things together, you uploaded a bunch of spreadsheets and it can organize stuff, you know, in a way that's amazing.
[00:49:34] But when it comes to the human components of our job, our opinion, our voice.
[00:49:39] And even the guidance that we would give to our to our clients, the psychology, the connection, we cannot surrender that and when I see it, I'm just like, no, not you too, please not to.
[00:49:52] You know, because I can you can read it and you're like, that's chat GPT's voice. The dude might agree, the guy might agree. He obviously posted it. So he does agree with what chat GPT decided the framing of this conversation was.
[00:50:06] We see it with listing descriptions. And if you are, if you're just throwing it in there and saying, make this more appealing to XYZ type of buyer, you are going to get a very similar listing description from everybody else that's doing it, which is most agents.
[00:50:24] And everything looks the same and everything reads the same. And it's just seamlessly blends.
[00:50:31] Yeah, modern built crafted for modern living. I mean, it has these key phrases nestled in the blah, blah, blah.
[00:50:38] There's a lot, there's a lot there. But I do think that, you know, everybody's kind of playing around with it, trying to figure out where it matters, where it doesn't like do buyers care, do they care when they read this.
[00:50:48] How many listings are they looking at? And if they're picking up, if they're mostly looking at images and they're picking up the valuable information from the description, but not really looking at the artistic writing of the description, maybe buyers don't care.
[00:51:02] But then be curious to pull your audience to see how many buyers are in the audience that actually read the MLS description.
[00:51:10] You know, that's a red in the description. It probably probably people are.
[00:51:14] It's an art for us. It's like writing our listing descriptions on art. I used to train the agents on this. I had a whole structure. And it's about the experience and like something that you walk up and you feel that's visceral.
[00:51:25] Like, you know, as you traipse through the garden and you know, like it should feel like the moment of walking up to the front door.
[00:51:33] Now it's just like, I don't even know if people have the attention span. They just look at the pictures. It's cute. I want to go.
[00:51:39] It's the one place where we can kind of be creative. So I think that's why it like makes us feel, you know, that we're putting our little signature on it. And within the industry, we do care.
[00:51:49] But you're right. Does the public really read it? Probably not.
[00:51:52] I don't know. I want to know though. I think there needs to be data on this. I just really have the data to know.
[00:51:58] Well, I mean, I don't think people are reading much of anything. So I think that's big.
[00:52:03] There could be that too. There could be that. I mean, listen, we're scrolling right and like the hunt has now.
[00:52:09] One thing in the democratization of the data, which is another thing we can talk about with this MLS, although I'm sure our time is almost up.
[00:52:15] But, you know, I've heard and Parker brought it up from Housewell on our call as a potential future of like an open source MLS.
[00:52:27] I think I might have solved. I'm going to crack the code DJ. Check this out. Listen to this idea. You ready for this.
[00:52:35] I want a nationwide off market open source.
[00:52:41] Listing service. Okay.
[00:52:43] So it's just for agents. It's not for agents of a particular brokerage. It's just for agents and it's off markets.
[00:52:51] Okay.
[00:52:53] So something like, I'm sure you remember the PLS. Sure.
[00:52:57] Which or which got law suit anti-trust lawsuit. They're still involved in the sauce right now, which is a private listing service or something pocket listing service.
[00:53:06] And now it's changed to another name.
[00:53:10] But, you know, people haven't really been using it because of the threat of lawsuits and all this stuff.
[00:53:15] But, but if, if, if what happened, if what I think could happen in the future happens as in if, if, if, if NAR threatens Compass and all the anywhere brands or whatever Compass brands now I guess.
[00:53:29] With anything, which I don't know that they will do because they've been largely silent throughout this entire experience. Okay, strikingly silent like, in drought silence.
[00:53:40] But if Compass and the rest of the brands decide to pull out of NAR so that they can be rid of the, of the responsibilities of clear cooperation and all this anti-trust crap.
[00:53:51] If they can do that.
[00:53:53] Then it's possible that even more spotlight will be put on whether or not we need the MLS system the way that it really is.
[00:54:03] So if we had, if we all didn't have to abide by the current system.
[00:54:10] And there was an, like there was an open source nationwide pocket listing network that we could all put our pockets in so that we at least marketing to agents outside of our brokerage.
[00:54:23] And in that way, a small brokerage like me could market my off market because not against the law to happen off market to somebody at a large brokerage and vice versa.
[00:54:34] You know, there's no, there's no distinct disadvantage to a client of a smaller firm.
[00:54:40] If that, if they choose to market off market, which again, the seller choice thing is the thing ref can keep saying over and over again that I.
[00:54:48] But you know, whatever, let's say it's true, right.
[00:54:52] So how does that is I want to market off this off market. We have that one. All agents in America can access that right, but it's not on truly it's not on red fin. It's not on so.
[00:55:02] Gotcha. So, who manages it? Who's the owner of my, my thought is similar to how we currently have.
[00:55:12] So, if you have a large legal liability for the accuracy of our information by virtue of our DRE license, right.
[00:55:20] If there is no managing organization, so to speak, if it more serves as an aggregator that I manually enter information and then on myself and responsible for the information that's in there.
[00:55:33] So if you as a broker, I am.
[00:55:35] So if you put in what about fraud you put in bogus information, who, but you're a licensee anybody could report you to the DRE and be like that person.
[00:55:44] So you're still there. It's a self reporting system. If people basically are doing unethical things in there.
[00:55:52] Well, you still have your what would be unethical about entering your listing that's not lying about lying about what's on the listing.
[00:56:02] But if you are a licensee, you can't lie without there being potential consequences.
[00:56:08] Right. I'm just saying the police is it. Yeah. Okay. That's what I'm saying. I do think that there is a.
[00:56:14] Oh, you're right. I mean, you can't do it. You're right.
[00:56:16] You can't do it now. Yeah. You can't do it now.
[00:56:18] I mean, the MLS to police me. In fact, I don't even know when the NLS got policing authority. I think it was with the settlement because prior to that.
[00:56:25] The NLS in and of itself at least in California is all is already flawed. The data entry is wrong. Some people change their listings depending right away and it stops the days on market count.
[00:56:37] Some people leave it as as looking what is used to be looking for backup and is an active contingent.
[00:56:43] And it keeps the day count rolling. So when you're looking at days on market, the data is wrong.
[00:56:48] Also all the off markets are only sometimes entered in the MLS when somebody wants to for purposes.
[00:56:54] So it's not like it's tied into the tax records. Now a lot of agents are taking the pictures off. So there's only one exterior picture. I can't even see if it's a comp anymore because I can't see any of the interior pictures.
[00:57:05] So there are issues already with our MLS, but our profession needs to stop acting like little babies and start acting like the highly trained professionals that we are.
[00:57:21] And make sure that we are behaving as such. And if we are not just like currently right now to this moment, if I enter incorrect information into the MLS on my blog on my social anywhere else, somebody could report me to the DRE.
[00:57:36] I honestly don't think the MLS, you know, I entered a try this private. Have you heard of this this new delayed entry thing?
[00:57:43] No.
[00:57:44] This was the MLS is rather the NA, NAR's solution to the private listing problem.
[00:57:52] Yeah.
[00:57:52] Okay. It's kind of a media in the middle, right? So I have to put it in the MLS, but instead of putting it out right away, which was the previous.
[00:58:00] Yeah, you can do it.
[00:58:01] You can delay it. Okay. So I do that. First time I've ever done that. I just did it for really great listing in Granada Hills. Guys.
[00:58:09] I mean, designer top of the line. So incredible.
[00:58:14] It's a, it's a large property with a lot of detail, a lot of design detail.
[00:58:20] 10 photos. They allow us.
[00:58:25] I'm like, why? Yeah, that's why would you only allow me 10 photos? It's like punitive.
[00:58:31] It's just really it is. So so when it comes to the Zillow thing, when when this policy first came out when this there are no off market listings policy came out, I was like, finally, finally, because 85% of home buyers look on Zillow, right?
[00:58:50] We know they most sellers want their house on Zillow. You want your house on Zillow. So it reaches the buyers. They have mastered that platform.
[00:58:57] And I dropped the ball when they didn't create a different rule book for the hybrid portal. That is what I think it should have. It came up for all of us. We were watching it happen. They're advertising our listings. They're selling our leads. They're using our data.
[00:59:11] And the lessons are getting paid. We're pissed off. We're vocalizing it. Nobody wants to hear it. Okay. This was the beginning of my barking career.
[00:59:19] Okay. I'm like, the little guy always the little guy, you know, I spent a lot of money on these images, but I knew I wasn't the only one. I knew everybody kind of felt this way, right? So Zillow's been the bad guy.
[00:59:31] And then finally, you know, in the past couple of years, now they have to disclose who the listing agent is now people kind of are getting the memo about how things work and Zillow up the game.
[00:59:44] But I went to NAR and I said, listen, this isn't fair. This loophole creates an in balance in the way that clear cooperation is executed. And I don't think it's great for the consumer that that in balance is there.
[01:00:00] And it's certainly not great for you're supposed to represent all of us, right? Not just the big guys. So I'm a dues paying number two. I don't think this is fair. And they were like, there's really nothing we can do. I had a whole committee there. They hired a new vice president of strip of industry relations.
[01:00:16] He kind of turned it over to the MLS committee guy and they were kind of like, listen, you know, we can't really do anything about this because of anti-trust laws.
[01:00:25] I don't like right. I don't even know how that conceptually works. But this is what they're telling me. So then Zillow does it. And I was like, yes, finally, Zillow's doing what NAR could not do or didn't have the balls to do. I don't even know what they're doing it.
[01:00:40] And they're standing up for it because they actually believe it's the right thing to do.
[01:00:44] Right. And so I'm like, NAR should be on the side of Zillow because Zillow is enforcing the clear cooperation policy, which again, I have a major issue with. But at least everybody has to play by the same rules, supposedly, you know, but then again, this loophole is the problem with it because there is a loophole. So Compass is playing by the same rules by creating the private listing network, her the loophole.
[01:01:10] And you know, it's the pot calling the kettle black 100% and I think it's it's kind of interesting to see these people fighting and then know what's boiling on what's happening down here is this working group of see, I don't know if you saw this news headline, but there's a working group of brokerage owners CEOs who basically went to NAR and said, we need to make some changes.
[01:01:40] And they kind of their secret, their secret United real estate is Duffy is the only one who's actually come out vocally, but there are articles about what their demands were one of which was getting rid of clear cooperation policy, which NAR for some reason has just been reluctant to do, even though it's caused all of these problems.
[01:01:57] So what's boiling down here is who gets access to the client first and how like I think the the listing data on some level is going to be democratized like I don't think the private listing is going to work for sellers, at least in a market like this right now, I don't know why you wouldn't want maximum exposure when things are a little harder to sell.
[01:02:21] Yeah, unless you're celebrity or you need privacy, but even then it doesn't really make sense, but okay, fine, you know, yeah, right it doesn't yeah, I mean, that's that's why my idea of the national listing that were to cover this cover the off market thing.
[01:02:37] And then if we had an open source MLS, then we really would it need MLS either, I mean.
[01:02:45] It all be similar to how we trade Bitcoin in a sense like Bitcoin is not regulated and it could be used in nefarious ways, of course, to wander money and things like that, but at the very least anyone can have access to it, it's not really policed.
[01:03:01] It's kind of self-policed and if people are doing the various things, then government agencies can try to figure out what's going on, but it is open source right and so there is a version of this that could be an MLS a private listing or non-emoral.
[01:03:15] I mean, right or at least at least in a compromise make one MLS per state.
[01:03:20] Just one MLS per state wouldn't that be great because we all sell multiple different parts of our state, it's a state license, one MLS per state and open source private listing network that's for nationwide REALTORS and we can all search on that.
[01:03:35] And there you go. Now, Zillow gets its listings that are on the MLS, we have the right to sell our clients houses off market if we want to.
[01:03:44] This would be only though if NAR would back off clear cooperation, which they're not even enforcing anymore anyway, which is good. But then when I saw in that in that article about the working group that in 2022 NAR had like $2 billion in the bank.
[01:04:02] And they have a private capital for profit group. Did you know that? No, it's called second century ventures. Who knew I've been a member of NAR for 20 years. I had no idea.
[01:04:17] But what this working group is saying is like you guys are going to continually be hit with lawsuits because you have too much money in the bank. Give us our money back.
[01:04:26] Yeah, that's basically what they said. Give us a rebate. Give us our money back.
[01:04:30] Every year we ask. And by the way, I'm in Chicago. This is where it's headquartered. And I actually go into that building quite not that that's important. But I go to that building a lot because the local association, which I volunteer at is there. And I don't really ever see NAR because they're on different floors.
[01:04:46] But we you know, we reach out to them. I'm fairly known here in Chicago, at least to the NAR people who, you know, maybe familiar with the show who work in this area and they have people that work all over the country. But my point is is every year we go to them and say, hey, we want to talk to you guys.
[01:05:01] And every year they just ignore and I don't understand like I get it. You're busy. I'm not in men. That's fine. But I've got a pretty big audience for your point across. And all of my audience are members.
[01:05:14] So wouldn't you like to speak directly to members and say, here's what we're doing. Here's what we're up to. I never get a sense of what they're doing or what they're up to. I really don't know what it is.
[01:05:25] Right. And you know, they have a lot of money. And I'm not saying they're even doing anything wrong. I just want to know what they're doing. That's all I want to know.
[01:05:34] Well, there's a transparency piece in this too. Listen, I have made the case on my podcast and publicly that I do think we should have an organization. Right.
[01:05:46] Like there is a reason why we need to lean on each other, learn from each other.
[01:05:51] Oh, wait. You'll eat around our lobbying efforts. I do think that's valuable. But but in this day and age, the way that if any are not making policies, like the way they govern with a thousand volunteer members, 95 committees, is banana is an unnecessary. If you've ever joined one of these committee calls.
[01:06:12] You see, I have 100 people on a Zoom, it seems like.
[01:06:15] It's like, how can anything ever get done?
[01:06:18] Or how could it not just be group think?
[01:06:20] I've served on the Board of Directors for LA for a minute
[01:06:23] and I didn't like the way it worked
[01:06:24] and they didn't like me either
[01:06:25] because I kept trying to bring up the transparency issue
[01:06:28] with the listing brokerage information
[01:06:29] and they were like, you're in the wrong place,
[01:06:32] you can go somewhere else
[01:06:34] and I kept bringing up clear cooperation as an issue
[01:06:37] and they told me this is not the right venue for that
[01:06:39] and then I went on in,
[01:06:42] and I spoke about what I was feeling about that
[01:06:47] and I got a cease and desist from my own association
[01:06:52] because they did not want me up there
[01:06:55] challenging the merits of this policy
[01:06:59] that has so many flaws in it.
[01:07:00] And I'm like, this is, on one hand, they'll tell you,
[01:07:03] if you go to any conferences, they'll say,
[01:07:05] get involved, get involved, get involved.
[01:07:06] But once you get involved, they do not want you to think,
[01:07:10] talk, challenge.
[01:07:12] They say they do, but my experience is they don't.
[01:07:16] That's just my experience.
[01:07:17] It is play ball for sure.
[01:07:19] 100%.
[01:07:20] And I'm like, how could it not be
[01:07:21] if you got all these people who have to come to one agreement
[01:07:25] on something and there are too many people in the room,
[01:07:29] it's gonna feel like group think.
[01:07:31] There's not even enough time on the call
[01:07:32] to have really challenging opinions.
[01:07:34] But this is my life, this is my future
[01:07:37] and it's moving really fast.
[01:07:39] So I think the idea of holding data to get back to it,
[01:07:43] this idea of data being precious.
[01:07:45] That's an OG idea, right?
[01:07:47] That's how it was prior to the internet, right?
[01:07:49] The agents were the gatekeepers.
[01:07:51] We held the listings, we had to give you access
[01:07:54] to the listings.
[01:07:56] I think we can throw that out the window.
[01:07:59] The reality is there's nothing in the MLS
[01:08:01] that my client cannot see on Redfin or Zillow, right?
[01:08:05] So I am no longer the gatekeeper.
[01:08:07] So the only gate that's left is private listings.
[01:08:10] That's a gate.
[01:08:11] Yeah.
[01:08:12] But do we want, does it serve the interest of the seller?
[01:08:17] If you have to sign a disclosure that says,
[01:08:19] I understand by doing this, I might not get the best price,
[01:08:23] I might not get the best terms.
[01:08:24] I might not have the most clients.
[01:08:26] Like why would you sign that?
[01:08:28] Don't sign that, you don't need to do that.
[01:08:31] There's, it's all smoking mirrors, right?
[01:08:33] It feels like it to me,
[01:08:35] especially when you see that the majority
[01:08:37] of those privately marketed listings end up on the MLS anyway.
[01:08:40] And that's why it's really...
[01:08:42] It's just a testing round.
[01:08:44] It's a marketing ploy and it's also,
[01:08:47] it's gaming the system, you're like,
[01:08:48] I can market without days on market.
[01:08:50] Well, don't we all wish we could do that?
[01:08:51] You know what I mean?
[01:08:52] Wouldn't that be amazing?
[01:08:53] But if you're only marketing to a small group of people,
[01:08:56] is your market test really a market test?
[01:08:57] No, the market test is out here.
[01:08:59] And if you're expert in your field,
[01:09:01] you have the ability to review the last 30 listings
[01:09:04] and a half mile radius with similar specs
[01:09:06] and be able to advise your client
[01:09:08] on what the range of listing prices are
[01:09:10] and what the demand will be at the different price points.
[01:09:12] All that information is also available
[01:09:14] on almost every platform, on RPR, on Reels Scout.
[01:09:18] On all these platforms, you can look up the market demand
[01:09:21] in the area, you do not need to do it that way.
[01:09:24] So that part feels disingenuous to me.
[01:09:28] But you know, if a seller says, I wanna market it,
[01:09:31] I don't wanna have people through,
[01:09:32] I don't wanna put it on at Christmas.
[01:09:34] I know that that's a bad time,
[01:09:36] but I still would sell it at a certain price point
[01:09:38] if you bring me the buyer.
[01:09:40] There should be a place for any agent
[01:09:42] at any brokerage to get that word out.
[01:09:45] And so I just see a statewide MLS
[01:09:49] and an open source or not even open source
[01:09:53] or like the private listing network
[01:09:54] coming back on board, having a nationwide place
[01:09:57] for private listings and a statewide MLS
[01:10:00] and it solves the problem.
[01:10:01] I'm not even sure I would need local membership,
[01:10:05] national membership.
[01:10:07] Did you see Russ Kaffano's op-ed?
[01:10:09] No, I haven't yet.
[01:10:10] Oh, that's a good one to read.
[01:10:12] We should put that link in for your people.
[01:10:14] I think nationwide private listing
[01:10:17] it would have to be a non-privatized.
[01:10:20] It would have to be kind of like
[01:10:21] how alcoholics anonymous is run.
[01:10:23] Like there's an open source.
[01:10:25] But you can't donate to them, you can't give them money.
[01:10:29] There's no membership fees.
[01:10:32] There's like everybody chips in a dollar
[01:10:34] or whatever they pay to be afraid.
[01:10:37] But it's something where there's no hierarchy,
[01:10:41] there's no incentive.
[01:10:43] Like it's just the data and we're just putting it out there
[01:10:46] and nobody can manipulate it.
[01:10:48] Isn't that just the way the MLS used to be?
[01:10:51] To me, our real estate license should be the thing
[01:10:54] that gives us access to all the things.
[01:10:57] We shouldn't need to join an MLS and NAR and CAR
[01:11:00] and Glar just to get a super access.
[01:11:03] You know what I mean?
[01:11:04] Why do we have to jump through so many hoops?
[01:11:07] I don't think we should need to do that
[01:11:09] when our job is to sell real estate, right?
[01:11:11] So what we need to do is put our beautiful listings
[01:11:14] in front of buyers wanting to buy
[01:11:15] and facilitate that transaction.
[01:11:17] Let's bring it back to the basics.
[01:11:19] Keep, I think, keep access as transparent as possible.
[01:11:23] Honor the seller's choices, yes.
[01:11:26] But also don't disempower if you really care
[01:11:29] about the outcome that the seller is going to have.
[01:11:32] Don't disempower agents at other brokerages
[01:11:34] from seeing what the seller has to offer.
[01:11:38] I mean, that just seems like a fiduciary responsibility
[01:11:40] to me.
[01:11:41] Otherwise, it's an inherent conflict
[01:11:43] with fiduciary duties.
[01:11:45] It's a conflict if all you're trying to do
[01:11:47] is double in the deal, which is always a problem.
[01:11:50] Of course.
[01:11:50] So I just don't understand why everybody wouldn't agree.
[01:11:55] Private listings are only in the best interests of the seller.
[01:11:58] If they, if we give it, if we give it the best shot,
[01:12:03] we possibly can and what does that look like, you know?
[01:12:07] I just, I think there needs to be an industry place for it.
[01:12:09] Plus, I wouldn't mind being able to say to buyers and sellers,
[01:12:13] I do have access to a nationwide private listing.
[01:12:18] I love it.
[01:12:18] I love it.
[01:12:19] That would be great.
[01:12:20] And then they never feel like, oh, well, I have to go
[01:12:23] by gun to the head with this agent
[01:12:26] that I don't even want to go with.
[01:12:27] But they told me that if I don't go with them,
[01:12:29] I won't have access to this private listing network.
[01:12:33] That already has so many potential discriminatory things
[01:12:36] that I around it.
[01:12:37] I just don't like it.
[01:12:38] I don't like it.
[01:12:39] I'm like for the people, man.
[01:12:41] I just want everybody to have an option
[01:12:43] to see what there is out there and have a chance
[01:12:45] at buying a home that they love and experiencing
[01:12:48] and seeing the joy of home ownership.
[01:12:50] Courtney Poulos has been our gosh.
[01:12:52] She is, you are amazing.
[01:12:54] She is amazing.
[01:12:55] And we want to do more of these.
[01:12:57] So if you like this kind of conversation,
[01:12:59] which isn't our normal conversation.
[01:13:01] So for seven years, we mostly talk to top agents
[01:13:04] saying, tell us your story.
[01:13:05] We still do that.
[01:13:06] We love that.
[01:13:07] We love hearing how agents are doing that
[01:13:09] and Courtney could do that as well.
[01:13:10] But I love having her on here to talk about
[01:13:13] what's currently going on in the industry.
[01:13:15] And we do this with Chris and Sal as well.
[01:13:18] But we thought, you know, wouldn't it be fun
[01:13:20] for Courtney and I to do more of these?
[01:13:21] So if you want more of this,
[01:13:23] and maybe we even take your questions live,
[01:13:27] maybe we interact, we certainly figure something out
[01:13:30] to where you can participate and be part of the conversation.
[01:13:34] That would be a lot of our,
[01:13:35] and you might have an opinion you want to share.
[01:13:37] We would love to hear from you as well.
[01:13:39] So let us know.
[01:13:41] Give us some feedback.
[01:13:41] If you want to keep this kind of conversation rolling,
[01:13:46] we can add this to our already lineup
[01:13:48] of stuff Courtney can add it as well.
[01:13:51] But I want you everybody to follow her on her YouTube channel,
[01:13:55] which is Acme Real Estate.
[01:13:56] You can find all of her the Clean Close podcast episodes,
[01:14:00] which is newer and it's really opinionated in a good way
[01:14:04] and takes a position and where as most agents
[01:14:07] aren't willing to do that.
[01:14:08] CourtneyPulos.com is where you go to find out
[01:14:11] all the things Courtney, she speaks, she writes,
[01:14:14] she has a sub stack, definitely subscribed to that.
[01:14:17] And she has a brokerage, Acme brokerage in LA.
[01:14:20] They are amazing.
[01:14:22] And you know, we were just talking, it was funny.
[01:14:26] I was talking to her before and I said,
[01:14:27] do you want more agents?
[01:14:28] Because I could probably turn on the spiket for you
[01:14:31] because we have so many listeners.
[01:14:32] And they're going to want to hang out with you
[01:14:34] after this episode because of how great you are.
[01:14:37] And she goes, I don't know.
[01:14:38] So, so, so,
[01:14:40] I never know if she wants, you know, because
[01:14:41] listen, we're quality, not a quantity game.
[01:14:45] It's a quality game and I just want people who are aligned.
[01:14:48] I could not agree with you more.
[01:14:50] But if you are some, maybe you're an agent
[01:14:53] in a different area and you have people that move
[01:14:55] in and out of the LA area and you want to just connect
[01:14:58] with them for referral reasons, yes, definitely reach out.
[01:15:00] And if you are an agent in the LA area and you do
[01:15:03] are interested, you know, you never know.
[01:15:05] Reach out and say, here's what I could offer you, right?
[01:15:07] But this is, this is the point is,
[01:15:09] we want more of these conversations.
[01:15:10] We want to hear the voice of our listeners
[01:15:14] and Courtney and I can bring that to you.
[01:15:15] So on behalf of, first of all, on behalf of our listeners,

Now, as a real estate recruiter, I can tell you the answer is always yes. But most agents aren't looking to move right now. So how do you know who to contact? Well, what if I were to tell you there's a recruiting and retention tool powered by artificial intelligence that shows you exactly which agents in your local market are looking to leave their brokerage right now. And which agents at your own firm are also looking to leave you. Now, I've been recruiting REALTOR's for 15 years and I've hired over 2000 agents. I can tell you with no exaggeration, this is the tool I've been waiting for. Corded's AI looks for trends across dozens of variables for each agent in your market and shows you which agents they believe are likely to move. Not only does it do that, but Corded's AI went and visited my recruiting website and read everything I offer. So now when I'm recruiting, Corded's AI tells me exactly what to say based on that agents needs and what my brokerage can offer. It even writes emails for me. I've never seen anything like it and I use it every single day. Now, if you are looking to grow your brokerage, Corded.io is the best tool out there. Visit Corded.io to schedule a demo again. That's Corded.io. And now, onto the show. Hello and welcome to another episode of Keeping It Real, the largest podcast made by real estate agents and four real estate agents. My name is DJ Paris. I am your guide and host through the show. And just a moment we're going to be speaking with top producer Courtney Poulos. Before we get to Courtney, just a couple of quick reminders. Oh, actually, before we get to that, I have a gift for everyone if you would like it. So one of my lovely sponsors granted this to me and asked me to distribute it for anyone that is interested just as a courtesy of being a keeping it real listener.

It's our little holiday gift to all of our listeners. So just wanted to make sure that you guys do that was available and super excited to give that to you. Also, just if you are new to the show, please tell a friend about this podcast. We've been doing this seven years all because our listeners tell other REALTORS about it. We appreciate you. If you're a returning guest or sorry returning listener or returning guest, we're excited to have you here. We appreciate you as well. Keep spreading the word and we want everybody to have a wonderful holiday season. And we also want to holiday a great holiday season. So tell other agents about us when they have some downtime. They can listen to some of our episodes. All right. Let's get right to it. My conversation with Courtney Poulos. Okay, favorite current favorite AI tool. My favorite current favorite AI tool is auto real app. Have you heard of it? No. So auto real app takes static images and turns them into viral video. And while viral, it's like short form video. And it makes it look like, you know, professionally done. So I can you hear that noise in the background? No, you're good. Oh, you can't. Okay, one sec. No, I can't hear it. You're good. Oh, you can't hear it. Okay. No, you're totally fine. So you make a static image. You upload it. It brings it to life essentially. It brings it to life. And not only that. Like if it's a fireplace, it'll add fire. If it's a hot tub, it'll make it bubble. You know, so you can actually add quite a few unique features with their AI edit tool. To make it feel even more realistic or warm like I added a hummingbird to one of mine. You can see it on at the clean, close my Instagram account. And then I can see it. What I love about it is that I'm over it with the photographer produced regular real estate videos, you know, they just, they just are boring to me. I don't like the way they transition. I don't like split screens. I don't like any of that. You know, I want something smooth and romantic and kind of gives you a feeling. So that's why adding those features like whether it's a bird flying in the sky or steam coming out of a teapot or fire in the fireplace. It just brings the image to life. I love it. Auto real app. Gotta try it. I have a promo code for it. Yeah. Well, we will put it in the show notes for sure.

So we will send a link to that. But just search for Courtney Poulos. You'll find her. She's everywhere. And Courtney, welcome. So let's talk. Let's get started the beginning because I don't know your origin story and where you came from and where, why you got into real estate. So tell us how that all happened. Yeah, sure. So, well, I don't know how far back you want to go. But basically I'm from state college, Pennsylvania, where Penn State University is. I'm an itni lion. And I had the unique experience of going to college very young. I was like 13 when I started dual instrument in college. I know. And I just. I was one of those kids. I think the teachers all realized that my desired challenge authority. Had had to get me out of high school, I was going to be disruptive. I really need to get this one out of here. Yeah, they're like she needs to go somewhere where they actually like questions, because you know, in high school, there's still an element of sort of like babysitting in the classes. So if you challenge the teacher too much. You get labeled like a trouble student and then they don't like that. So my teacher, my gifted ed teacher, she was just Mrs. Giddings, shout out Mrs. Giddings. So she, she, I started dual enrollment at Penn State when I was 13 by the time I was 16. I was full time at University of Maryland and by the time I was 17, I was working in PR. I was an editor at a fashion magazine. I was working as a waitress. I was also working as the secretary for the Capitol Hill women's political caucus in Washington. I was just doing too much, which is my nature. And I want an award, the Daniel J. Edelman public relations student of the year award 1997. And it took me anywhere in the world. I wanted an internship and I came to LA and when I got here, I was like, yeah, I don't think I want to leave this place. To be honest, I hadn't even completed college at that time. I since did, but I was moving so fast through life, like working so hard, so young that coming to LA felt like a great relief. You know, it kind of felt like a place where I could breathe. I became an actor. I was a singer. I had a TV show for a while. I was in the hospital and in 2000 and I guess it was around 2004. I met my future ex-husband and we were like, let's get the heck out of here. And he was a political theorist, kind of like a philosopher. And so he wanted to get his PhD so we're back in DC. And this is the part that gets a little weird. So after nine years of basically being my own boss, even though I had to work a million jobs in order to make a living. I got a job for the federal government at the substance abuse and mental health services administration disaster technical assistance center of the Department of Health and Human Services. Okay. You were a fed. I was a subcontractor to the fed, you know, feds and and it was the most soul crushing heart breaking experience. I was, it was, I hadn't lived that fluorescent light life for. I was like, never, ever really. And I'm like, they treat us like children. Like you can't take it. I can't work through my lunch break and leave an hour early. I, you know, I'm like a child, but I'm an adult and I did not like it. So I would work really fast. I was efficient at what I did and my boss came over and she said, you know, Courtney, you're working too fast. We need to build a government more hours. And I was like, I can't do this. That was the moment. I knew I had to do something else. I went on Craigslist. That was the thing at the time. And I found an assistant job to a REALTOR. And that is what brought me into real estate in 2005. And I just, it's been a journey. It's been a big journey. And I've learned so many things. How did you get, how did you get back out West? Well, after, is that the job that you took? No, no, after five years, I worked five years in DC, Maryland, and Virginia. James got his PhD. And we decided to move back to LA. I had a son and I had no business. And it's actually a funny story that I tell people who are trying to figure out how to get their first client. I had no business here. I had nothing. I had no clients. I had some people I knew from my previous life in entertainment. But I didn't really know anybody that would know me as a REALTOR. So there was this one flipper who was doing really cool work. I don't know, he was like staging when nobody else was and had this very retail surfer vibe about it. His name is Steve Jones and his company is called Better Shelter. They still, he still does flips. But anyway, I persistently called this guy. I called him over and over and over and over again. I made a spreadsheet of all of his acquisition costs and his sales costs. And I tried to predict how much he kind of contributed and what his spread was. So he finally gave me a meeting. And I remember he didn't even look me in the eye in this meeting, which was super awkward. And I said, listen, I've done all this work. I want to be your dedicated agent. I've been selling for five years in DC, but I have no clients here. I can dedicate 100% of my effort to finding new projects and to reselling your projects. And I guess that was compelling enough because one thing that we we miss sometimes in real estate is like, what is the client experience like if he's experiencing 10 or 15 different agents sending him all the same listings. They don't know how to calculate which ones are actually good investments or not. They're not really looking for the same things that he's looking for. He needed somebody to help streamline his hunting experience. And I was there for that. So, you know, that was kind of the beginning of what ultimately ended up becoming at me, our current brand, my brokerage, which has a niche specialty in renovation, resale. So we do work with a lot of really great designers, flippers, to reinvent homes, but in a more editorial way. So if you go on our website and you look at our listings, you can see that I'll kind of have a certain vibe. That's what we're known for. Even though we don't do the work, we represent the sellers, but I think renovation artists in LA know that they have a home at Acme, like we can support them and fit and finish selection and we know how to source things. We have the right stages, we have the right photographers. It's overall kind of experience. And that's been an advantage because like you said in the intro, you know, we got to compete against the big guys all the time, you know, I'm the little engine that could always always, but I do think that there's an advantage in that. I mean, what a cool brand. You're a renovation. Say that again. What was what do you call it? A renovation term. Thank you renovation resale. I mean, that is a, I've never heard of somebody branding to that particular niche and it's brilliant because who doesn't want that on a property that's, you know, however many years old would qualify, you know, in a lot of properties obviously would. And what a cool thing that you probably don't have any other brokerages that are that hyper focused. And so that probably just helps the brand and perspective just just oh my gosh, what a cool idea. Thanks. I mean, you know, it's a here's the thing that I've learned. Okay. I've seen other people other other, you know, our brochures are like everybody loves them. Like people walk in there like, wow, you guys do such beautiful marketing. And like, yeah, we do. Because I believe it real estate's like a tactile experience. That's when when it's like you can have a digital QR code sign in. I'm like, no, I want the interaction moment with the person when I asked them to sign in, even though sometimes lately it turns into almost a fist fight. But, you know, I still need you to know that I need you to sign in. And if you give me some kind of scribble scrabble, it's my moment to interact with you as a human like, I can't read this John are you trying to get me a fake name. Like, that's my moment to show you my humanity. And the more digitized things get fewer, you know, options that are for that. So, so yeah. So anyway, my point and story is I've seen at other people's open houses like they take our brochure and they try to make it. Or, you know, people have, I've built a lot, I say built like a lot of people have built their staging brands on our back or, you know, people have stolen clients like whatever, you know, it's all good. But it certainly keeps us on our toes. And the one thing that we just never compromise on is the amount of money that we spend on our clients. We spend thousands more, especially markets like these where people are pulling back because the market slower. We don't pull back. We still do the full scale marketing press. And, you know, we just know that our commitment to the, to the client experience is higher than some of our competition. I hate to say like that could the sound so whatever. But, you know, we've also gotten feedback. You know, the feedback seems to be from people who come to us. Like, I felt like my agent wasn't listening to me. Right. And I think that's something we all have to let check ourselves on. So the reason why I'm not like a grow the brokerage type of brokerage is because quality can go out the window when there's no broker to really manage the training. And I'm a very hands-on broker as in I'm here for all the questions. And I run a training program at acne too. So, yeah, no, I totally understand that. And as somebody who runs a larger size brokerage with hundreds and hundreds of agents, I will tell you that is one of our challenges is not to be seen as a big brokerage. There are somebody's just a number and it is a battle because, you know, we have over 700 agents here and like, that's cool for us from a revenue perspective. But we have to make each one of those agents feel so incredibly special, which is tough. And a lot of those agents, thankfully, are so self sufficient that they really don't need so much from us, but those newer agents are the ones that are looking for that development. Like we actually have it, but it is hard to sell that to somebody who's not currently a kale agent because they might go, well, how can you guys possibly do that with so many agents? And it's like, oh no, I know it sounds like we can't we actually can't, but, but that's the challenge, right? And so you're at a brokerage, which is, you know, at the right size for what you do and you're right quality does get, get questioned, right? What do you get to a certain size? So I love that. Sorry, didn't mean to interrupt you. No, I was just going to say every market's different, you know, I will say, I recently on one of my clean clothes podcast interview this guy named Parker, a very cool guy from a company called Housewell. And his company has an eash of selling to flippers selling for flippers, I guess, at some kind of a discount. It's a discount brokerage model, right? And, you know, I challenged him on the podcast. I'm like, why would you create something where the agents are getting paid a third of what they normally would pay him? Like are you not training your agencies? Like, no, we use a third part of we you show him me for this. I'm like, how do you quality, how do you quality control that? Like, how do you know that that agent knows how to host an open house? I'm just going to put this out there. Okay, for a client for a buyer, if a buyer walks into an open house, they have an experience at that open house. You cannot underestimate the value of the agent interaction at an open house. It's how most new agents get their new clients. And it's one of these few moments that we have in human life, where you actually get to engage with a human being in person that maybe you've never met yet, maybe that wasn't referred to you. So you get to to care a little bit more about somebody else. So the reason why I'm saying that is because we do a secret shopper experiment at acne every time we do a training session. I send agents out into the field. The trainees go out and they go to open houses. And if if the person asked them, are you an agent that have to say yes, right? But if the person doesn't even engage with them, doesn't ask them to sign in, doesn't ask them their name, doesn't ask if they're an agent or neighbor or a buyer, whatever. We make a note of it. So we're keeping stats on this. They each go to like four open houses and come back. So sometimes I have like 30 open house, 30 open houses at all different price points and data points in the city to see how the open house agent is performing. Yeah. And it's really underwhelming. It's really underwhelming. Like probably seven out of 10 times the agent doesn't ask the buyer to sign in. Crazy. I'm like, how are you getting feedback if this doesn't sell like in a market like this, we have to do follow up. And I have to be able to say to my seller, people think it's over price or they think the backyard's not usable or something. I need to give them some feedback. If you don't have people signing in, how are you going to give them that? Even if you don't care about that, what you should, don't you want to lead like, is it no matter what you would want to lead? Yeah. Yeah. That part two, of course, leads important. I always think when I'm there selling the house, I'm there to sell that house, right? I'm there in my seller said, if the seller's neighbor comes in, I want that neighbor to come in and be like, wow, court me really. I was doing a thing, you know, she was selling the house, you pointed out unique features or like, you know, characteristics of the home or the neighborhood or whatever. You know, I want every single agent to have a confidence in that environment that would stand the test of the seller's best friend coming in and reviewing them, right? Yep. But it's just too small for me or you know, it's just not right. Then yes, of course, you want that fire lead, of course. But the art of sales is not in my ability to sell. It's in the clients ability or desire to trust me that I know more about them. I know more about the process of buying than they do, I should say, I know more about their experience are about to have than they do and I can guide them. I'm trustworthy. And that does not come from being on your cell phone from being like any questions like we're working as a receptionist at a juice bar like that ain't it. It is not it. So I was, I have a, I know that some, some places in America have a lot of discount brokerages or a lot of flat B agents and maybe there are places there where quality control becomes a little less important in LA. It's the NFL of real estate. We are competing with people who have high volume deals, even though that's just location base. That's like, which part of town did you start working on that, but I digress. And then, you know, they have a big social following some people are famous, some people are on TV shows, you know, it's competitive. It's like you got to know your stuff backwards and forwards or you really can't make it here. Well, what I'm what I'm hearing is I couldn't agree with, I couldn't agree more with everything you said because what we're really talking about is intentionality and like really thinking about the experience. And I think that is the place where you start an end is like the client experience. So for example, I'm in the process of redeveloping our recruiting website for REALTORS that may want to join us. And we would I would always focus on transparency with our pricing with with our commissions. And I thought that was the most honest and authentic way to go and it really is in a certain sense. But what I wasn't thinking about was what is the experience that for the agent avatar that we want like, I'm not going to forget about what DJ thinks is the most authentic and honest, what did they want? What's actually most important to them and what we found since I'm not a practicing agent. I mean, I have a license but I don't use it. But what we found is even though I know hundreds and if not thousands of agents. That what I thought they wanted was not what they wanted to see. You know what they what they wanted to see was more about culture and more about the development. Like how do you actually help us grow? Because everyone says they did that help you. They have great training, great support. But what do you actually do? They're willing to pay whatever the fees and commissions are. They don't care. Now some people do care and those people that's great too. But for the people that we really want that's not their primary driver. It's not cost. We just thought that would be cool. Put our pricing and our commissions on there. And we did that for years and years and that got us to a certain number. And then we finally went, wait a minute. Why are we not getting this next level of agent? We went, oh, because they don't want that. They don't care. They want the development. And so we had to listen to them. So now I'm redesigning our site. And I really love to get feedback on it for many, but whether you're in our market or not, I'm not using this as a greeting pitch. But check it out at join kale.com. I have removed all the pricing. And now it's literally just here's how we develop you it. And you know this look hopefully attract a different type of agent because of course, you know, we're always looking to grow and expand as well. And so I totally, but that's what I had to do is I had to literally do the research and look into what do agents actually care about. And you do this the same thing with open houses like so what you're saying makes all the sense of the world is you want the experience. And what is it? What is a good experience? You know, we all know what it's like when you walk on to a car lot, whether it's, you know, a luxury lot or or more, you know, more affordably priced. And that sales person comes walking over you're like, oh god, just don't just be be so much. It's a retail shop. It's a clothing store. You know, can help you with anything you're like, no, I'm just looking. I don't want to talk to you. I don't want to be sold your bullshit. I don't want any of that. We just had that's our natural instinct. Yeah, we're selling our I'm selling my condo right now and moving into a different place. And so this morning, just a few hours ago, I was interviewing my fans and I were interviewing four people because we have to do repair. We have to rip up carpeting and put hardwood. And anyway, so we had two different people come. They were both seemingly probably the same as far as their abilities. But one was really gave us this experience that made us think they cared a little bit more. They were like, let's say, well, here's what I would do. Not just like what you want. Like he asked us that too. And then he said, I'm going to give you some advice. Like this is what you should do. And I'm not trying to upsell you. Here's why I'm telling you to do it. And again, it sounds like well, everybody should do that. But everybody doesn't. And like you were saying with the seven out of 10 go to open house, I don't even think they think about the experience. They just go, well, I'll just go to sit here. I'm going to, you know, have some, you know, food or drinks or whatever. I'll have some flyers. And I'm nice. And but they're not really thinking about from the moment they walk in, what's that first first impression. Exactly. What are the smells and the sights and all of that. Yeah, it's so important. And it's so important. So yeah, yeah, crafting an experience. That is, that's kind of what we're, what we strive to do every time. And, you know, what people do know us to do. And but I have a question for you about the recruitment thing. What's a red flag for you in the recruitment interview. Like what is something that you asked them and they give you this answer. And then you know, no, you're not right for us. Yeah, it's, so that's a great question. So I would say for people that are like super price focused that want like the highest commission, lowest fee and just are or asking for leads or people that are looking for the brokerage to really solve their problem, which if it's a development problem, great, we can do that. And if it's a pricing problem, if you have a low commission split, yeah, we could probably beat it. But if you're too focused on that, I get a little nervous because then I think you're going to leave and go to the person because we're not the highest. I mean, there's somebody's got higher commissions. I'm sure in lower fees. So we're not going to be that. And also too, it's just somebody who's. I just as long as somebody's like, I always ask, what do you expect from a brokerage? Like what do you actually need the brokerage to do for you? Because everybody has different needs. And it's like, okay, we can do that or we can't do that. So it's more about me getting clear about what they actually want. Yeah. And figuring it out, can we actually deliver that because if we don't deliver on what they think we should be delivering, they're going to leave anyway. And so it's really important for us to get super hyper focused on that before they come in. So it's not so many. It's not even so much about red flags because we're really lucky in that sense where we just don't really get a lot of bozos that come through. But we certainly get people who are looking for things that I have to like sniff out and go, oh, we don't do that. You know, because it'd be much easier just to be like totally just come on board. We'll take care of it. And then, you know, think down the road. Oh, we don't really want to deal with that because we only have so many staff here. There's 12 of us, but there's 700 agents like we have to be really, really mindful. So it's about the experience, though, and I want somebody to come in and go, I know DJ told me exactly how it's going to work. He's going to explain the onboarding. And then he talked about retention, like, why, how he's going to make sure and not me so much, but we have somebody in retention, their job is to make sure that you're happy. So that you say we pay that person to make sure you're happy. So he's going to be checking in with you and make sure that you're having a good experience here. So again, we're on the stage with that. So I want to talk about some industry news and just get a couple of quick. I'll give you because right now, you know, Compass and Zillow are battling heads are battling each other and and the longer heads, I guess, with private listing network and it's very interesting to see what Compass I think is trying to do and what Zillow is trying to hold on to. And I'm curious to see if you have a take on how broker should think about that. And then, where do you think it's headed. These are all very provocative questions. Well, here's the thing. Like, okay, Zillow, I starting again at the beginning of this. When clear cooperation policy was announced, I was like, this is a very poorly thought out policy. And the reason why I hated it, it's not because of the mandatory entry piece. It was because it had this little loophole for office exclusives. Now pocket listings are not against the law in most states, at least not in California. So it's not that they didn't exist before. But now all of the sudden, Compass who had the foresight to create something that they could potentially use as a marketing advantage in a very competitive market when people were, you know, 2% interest rates and 40 offers on the table and people are going crazy and they just want inventory that's not available yet. And the law, it would like hit a, a nerve, a demand, okay. And, you know, office exclusives, in case you don't know are not really office exclusives, it's brokerage exclusives. So in the state of California, if Compass has one broker, it could have that office exclusive network could be the entire state of California's private listings. And now with the Compass anywhere merger, that could obviously take over and he said publicly that, you know, that's the intention to give sellers the choice to market how they want. He also, Refkin also said very publicly to an AR, I'm not abiding by this policy and I'm not going to make my my agents abide by either. And I was like waiting for a response because much like, you know, much like the insanity of the COVID era, they actually had agents trying to police agents like our local association had like a tips line if you see somebody marketing a pocket listing, report them. So, you know, for a boutique brokerage, like we have 35 agents, you know, it's not we're not 8,000 agents, it doesn't even make sense for us to have a pocket listing network. Sure. But also does it even make sense for sellers to utilize. That's the real question. Who wins, right? Exactly. So I just find it really, really rich that if you read the text of these lawsuits that essentially Compass is saying, I can't believe Zillow doesn't want our listings publicly promoted when the whole reason why they're not publicly promoted is because your seller and you sold the seller on this idea of a not publicly promoted listing. The hypocrisy in it is just too much for me to bear. And when you see people jumping on other sides of it as it's almost like the government shut down, where if you're listening to MSNBC, you would think it was one side that did it. If you're listening to podcasters or something, you would think it's the other side that did it. And if you sit down at a table with somebody who's only listening to one side of this argument, you guys will never come to any kind of an agreement. Even right now, right now there's a very interesting conversation happening about the 50 year mortgage concept. Okay. I would love to know your thoughts on it. I'm having some initial thoughts on it, but Glenda Baker, who's a very famous Instagram video REALTOR. I've met her a few times. She's lovely lady. She speaks out of a ton of events. She's kind of the the spearhead of agent social media mavens, right? Like she's she's just she sits in her car. She does a video. It gets thousands and thousands of views and tons of engagement because people want to know what she has to say. So she posted something on it saying that this is the scan. This is a trash idea. There were even some agents at my company reposting and saying like, look, it's a scam. It's a scam. And I'm like, okay, it's a okay. I I understand why it makes zero sense for anyone to hold a 50 year note. From it from a calculating the interest. If you held that note the entire length of the loan typeway, right. I get that. And I can even see how if you're thinking with that same thinking cap. And F.A. J. Lone could be predatory as well. Sure. 3% down higher interest rate mortgage insurance is at lower credit score. I know the credit score thing is another thing that's going on. But but at the time when I bought my first place when I didn't think I could ever buy a place, the idea of actually owning a home felt so outside. Like my family's situation and I didn't think I could do it. Okay. It was that first lady I ended up working for Polly who sent me Courtney. You can do this. You can do this where there's a will there's a way. This is the type of loan you should get. And she was like, just see if you qualify. And that was how. I ended up buying my very first place and that I then sold for a profit and turned and bought another place and sold that, you know, it ultimately started my real estate ownership career without that little. That little. You know that that type of loan that low down payment loan with the lower credit score requirement and you know that opportunity. I couldn't have done it. Sure. So so my point of view on it is it's not going to be for everybody. Okay. Of course not. And it shouldn't be. Of course not. This is in my opinion. Potentially a creative short term solution like an arm like an adjustable rate mortgage that has a fixed rate for seven years. Like for example, arms in our market are lower interest rate than 30 year conventionals right. So for people who are having trouble qualifying because of the interest rate using an arm when you know that on a 30 year conventional loan. The first 10 years are heavily interest loaded. That's also what you get your mortgage interest deduction on. Okay. You can do an arm a seven one arm lock in your seven years. Look at the amortization schedule on a 30 year conventional loan calculate the amount of principle that is applied each year and make a principal payment during the life of your arm each year to match the 30 year. So then you do have a principal reduction, even if it's an interest only arm and you're getting your tax right off and you can refinance into a conventional loan when your financial position is better and whatever the advantage of a 50 year versus a seven year in this scenario is that if you lose your job or your your earning power goes down, you still have a monthly insure consistent lower monthly interest rate. Now, if you're renting, we know that's 100% loss. You might as well just count it as a 100% loss no tax break, no appreciation, nada, nothing. So if you're comparing a program that could potentially get somebody in versus a program that will keep them perpetually a renter and you think perpetually a renter is a better idea than you're not following the hedge funds, the private equity, the, you know, the people who are who are committed to making a nation of renters subscription based economy where they don't even think they want to own. And that is the problem. I'm like any smart creative person who's ever been poor knows that if you need to buy cheese, if you need to buy a thing, you figure out how to do it. You know what I did when I was little I sold bookmarks that I taped. I thought I was laminating them door to door for 25 cents. I sold I sold cards Olympic cards and gifts door to door when I was eight years old because I needed a backpack. So if you don't understand it where there's a wilderness away, sometimes you got to do what you got to do in order to get in the door. And then once you're in the door, you got to put your brain to use and I'm just it's there's something about about it, the conversation that almost makes it feel political and I'm like, why is this political. I'm an advocate for homeownership. I'm also a person who came from nothing and understands the value of homeownership and what it's done for me in my life. So when I see like this lady today on the comments, you can go to the Glendipigra post. She was like, this is the I said something very I'm very calm like about it, even though I'm passionate about homeownership. I also haven't figured it all out like I don't think I've sorted through. I understand the foreclosure risk. I heard one person talking about the appraisals, you know, that they might be more stringent with the appraisals because you kind of need to guarantee that it's in a market where the market's appreciating in order for it. And that caused foreclosures. I don't understand all the nuances and ins and outs. I'm sure people will be discussing them. But in the spirit of having conversation, which by God, I'm an American, right, and also an advocate for homeownership and also somebody who benefited from creative financing and probably FHA. Hey, the man was it was pre 2008. So you could potentially call that predatory lending. There's no real reason why anybody should give anybody alone with 3% down, right? But it got me in, but it got me in. Yeah. So when I see she said something like, you must be the most ignorant person I've ever met. This is total bullshit. These people are going to go into foreclosures. It's going to create a whole crisis. And I'm like, OK, I hope you have a better day because we're just having a conversation here. I'm just throwing it out there because people seem to be so animated that it's a whole con that, you know, that maybe they're not looking at all sides of it. And that's all, I mean, it could be a con, right, like a 50 year mortgage. What's the benefit lower monthly payment bank makes more money. Get so much credit card interest rate is 22%. So what we're talking about 6% but you're going to have an appreciating asset. You're going to have a tax write off. You're going to have the value of home ownership, which improves culture society civilization writ large, like the advantages of not renting away out way. And you're not holding it for 50. You're not holding it for 50 years. You're holding it for five to seven years, most likely. Yeah, and it's probably not for somebody a retiree. This is for people starting out. And yeah, they're going to pay, they're going to pay a bunch more interest over time. And we get it. But at least it gets them in the door. And that's it. That you know, it's it is it is a it's interesting and it's interesting. I think the coupling of the removal of the credit score. I think that's also a piece that makes it suspicious a little bit. It's like, listen, nobody wants another crisis. Like I'm very invested in real estate. I do not want to see another crisis. I don't want to see a bunch of people in foreclosure. I don't want that. But when people make the argument like this. Some people are making on on the Instagram post like, you know, what if somebody loses their job. I'm like, well, you could lose your job today and get kicked out of your apartment. You could lose your job and not be able to pay your 30 year conventional mortgage as well. Like I don't think that really matters as much. You know, my your punch is full up. I don't really think that's the that's the concern. You know, and the other thing to you is and I don't I don't mean to say anything super controversial. But what I will say is in my experience in life. And I am not saying that I look I've been laid off where I was a really good employee and I just got a perfect review. And they just needed to cut costs and I was an expensive guy at the company and they let me go and it was terrible. But I've been fired places to where I didn't do a good job. So I've had both experience. I've also I've also been at this job for 15 years and hopefully hopefully we'll continue here. But my point is is that if you're really good at your job and you get laid off or you get fired or whatever, you'll you should be able to find work. And if you can't find work. That's a mentality. You have to build your skill set because really good painters, really good plumbers that good dentists. You you you find that they never really have a problem getting clients because I'm telling my 16 year old the same thing. I'm like, look, if you don't want to go to college. Or, you know, computer science, which is going to be replaced by AI in a minute. Why not get a trade. Why not learn a trade. We need Votec back in our high schools. You know, I'm a huge fan. And plus how many times have you had something leaking or like your sink is leaking or your washing machine is leaking or your, you know, your car something and you're like, darn it. I wish I had a mechanic in the family. I wish I had a plumber in the family. So I didn't have to outsource this. I mean, we need to bring that back. Well, the mechanic is such a great a great point because when you find a mechanic that you trust you'd never ever question what they recommend going for when all of a sudden, right. You're like, oh, that like or good doctor or a good attorney or a good account or whatever good hairstyle is right. As it is, I have taken a lot of time to assemble really quality service people in my life, whatever their job is. And so now I don't have to think about it anymore. And I hold on to those people. And again, look, people get laid off and it's terrible. And I'm not suggesting it's anybody's fault for getting laid off. It happens. It's happened to me. And it's, but I do know that if you're really skilled. And if you're not, you can get skilled. And now we have just access to information where you to be to teach you pretty much anything you need to know. Yeah, it's free. But like you can get better at your job. And it is not crowded along that extra mile. Like you were saying about the open houses. When people tell me open houses don't work. I'm like, oh, no, I interview people top agents all over the country for the last seven years. Every single one of them tells me open houses work. But you say it doesn't. So it's like, okay, what are you doing? And then you find out they're not really hosting an open house. They're just put, you know, they're just doing it. But they're not really intentionally putting it in there. Well, yeah, it's not going to work for you. And it's all about just building your skills. And if you build your skills set as also with AI. So I think about this a lot because I think the lower quality REALTORS and I don't mean lower quality that they that they're they're they're just not putting in the time. Maybe they have another career or maybe they're just, you know, helping out a friend or family member once once and a while. And that's great. If you want to do that. But I think your your days are are it's going to be tougher for you because AI is going to solve for a lot of the things you can do with the really good agents. Everybody I know right now who's a really good agent is thriving. They're crushing it. And it's it's amazing. It's like because they know what they're doing and they care and they build their skill set. And that's like, oh my god, I gotta tell you something now. I got to tell you this thing. I'm sure you've noticed. I'm sure everybody's noticed it, but like, you know, on my on my podcast to clean clothes, we go over real estate news headlines, you know, we talk about the articles, talk about both sides of the scenario, trying to do it like a, you know, you know, like a news editorial style. Really powder point. Yeah, you know, and then I also have opinions about this. So I declare, you know, like what what what this little engine that could has to say about it and invite people to challenge me if they want to or agree or whatever. But I noticed I've noticed so many like I follow linked linked in is where it's at for real estate drama in my. Oh sure for sure. It's like they're so underestimated. I try to tell my agent friends who are who are like reality television junkies and like that are agents, you know, you love this like get in here because this is the most under exposed. Cady drama filled whatever. What's great about it is that's where REALTORS can go where their clients aren't going to see this post. Yeah, exactly. Yeah, and it's also I don't I don't understand the algorithm. I have zero idea why it decides to show me what it shows me. Yeah, it's really I really don't know. I feel like I see the same five people over and over again, or maybe those are the only five people posting on LinkedIn like nobody uses it, but what some people do. And the ones that do are very opinionated, but what I'm starting to see is clearly chat GPT written post content that's supposed to have an opinion, but the way it's written is really weird and it's obviously chat GPT. And I'm like, no, this is where you have to draw the line with AI. Once it takes your actual voice as an authority, then we have a problem. You have a problem like, hey, it's amazing for data analysis. Be self to check it. Make sure that it doesn't source site like source publications that don't exist, create bureaus that don't exist phone numbers, even quotes like chat GPT creates quotes to justify the opinion you're trying to make it have that are not sort sourceable. Like you have to be careful with that. And I saw one gal advising people it can it can like review the legal language in your contract for you. Do not do that. In fact, this week I'm going to have a DRE compliance person on the show to talk about the mistakes that agents are using while early adopting AI that could potentially be either a violation of licensing law or could open them up to litigation. Because there is a danger in adopting this too fast. But certainly it's good for what it is good for data analysis in investigating like, you know, putting things together, you uploaded a bunch of spreadsheets and it can organize stuff, you know, in a way that's amazing. But when it comes to the human components of our job, our opinion, our voice. And even the guidance that we would give to our to our clients, the psychology, the connection, we cannot surrender that and when I see it, I'm just like, no, not you too, please not to. You know, because I can you can read it and you're like, that's chat GPT's voice. The dude might agree, the guy might agree. He obviously posted it. So he does agree with what chat GPT decided the framing of this conversation was. We see it with listing descriptions. And if you are, if you're just throwing it in there and saying, make this more appealing to XYZ type of buyer, you are going to get a very similar listing description from everybody else that's doing it, which is most agents. And everything looks the same and everything reads the same. And it's just seamlessly blends. Yeah, modern built crafted for modern living. I mean, it has these key phrases nestled in the blah, blah, blah. There's a lot, there's a lot there. But I do think that, you know, everybody's kind of playing around with it, trying to figure out where it matters, where it doesn't like do buyers care, do they care when they read this. How many listings are they looking at? And if they're picking up, if they're mostly looking at images and they're picking up the valuable information from the description, but not really looking at the artistic writing of the description, maybe buyers don't care. But then be curious to pull your audience to see how many buyers are in the audience that actually read the MLS description. You know, that's a red in the description. It probably probably people are. It's an art for us. It's like writing our listing descriptions on art. I used to train the agents on this. I had a whole structure. And it's about the experience and like something that you walk up and you feel that's visceral. Like, you know, as you traipse through the garden and you know, like it should feel like the moment of walking up to the front door. Now it's just like, I don't even know if people have the attention span. They just look at the pictures. It's cute. I want to go. It's the one place where we can kind of be creative. So I think that's why it like makes us feel, you know, that we're putting our little signature on it. And within the industry, we do care. But you're right. Does the public really read it? Probably not. I don't know. I want to know though. I think there needs to be data on this. I just really have the data to know. Well, I mean, I don't think people are reading much of anything. So I think that's big. There could be that too. There could be that. I mean, listen, we're scrolling right and like the hunt has now. One thing in the democratization of the data, which is another thing we can talk about with this MLS, although I'm sure our time is almost up. But, you know, I've heard and Parker brought it up from Housewell on our call as a potential future of like an open source MLS. I think I might have solved. I'm going to crack the code DJ. Check this out. Listen to this idea. You ready for this. I want a nationwide off market open source. Listing service. Okay. So it's just for agents. It's not for agents of a particular brokerage. It's just for agents and it's off markets. Okay. So something like, I'm sure you remember the PLS. Sure. Which or which got law suit anti-trust lawsuit. They're still involved in the sauce right now, which is a private listing service or something pocket listing service. And now it's changed to another name. But, you know, people haven't really been using it because of the threat of lawsuits and all this stuff. But, but if, if, if what happened, if what I think could happen in the future happens as in if, if, if, if NAR threatens Compass and all the anywhere brands or whatever Compass brands now I guess. With anything, which I don't know that they will do because they've been largely silent throughout this entire experience. Okay, strikingly silent like, in drought silence. But if Compass and the rest of the brands decide to pull out of NAR so that they can be rid of the, of the responsibilities of clear cooperation and all this anti-trust crap. If they can do that. Then it's possible that even more spotlight will be put on whether or not we need the MLS system the way that it really is. So if we had, if we all didn't have to abide by the current system. And there was an, like there was an open source nationwide pocket listing network that we could all put our pockets in so that we at least marketing to agents outside of our brokerage. And in that way, a small brokerage like me could market my off market because not against the law to happen off market to somebody at a large brokerage and vice versa. You know, there's no, there's no distinct disadvantage to a client of a smaller firm. If that, if they choose to market off market, which again, the seller choice thing is the thing ref can keep saying over and over again that I. But you know, whatever, let's say it's true, right. So how does that is I want to market off this off market. We have that one. All agents in America can access that right, but it's not on truly it's not on red fin. It's not on so. Gotcha. So, who manages it? Who's the owner of my, my thought is similar to how we currently have. So, if you have a large legal liability for the accuracy of our information by virtue of our DRE license, right. If there is no managing organization, so to speak, if it more serves as an aggregator that I manually enter information and then on myself and responsible for the information that's in there. So if you as a broker, I am. So if you put in what about fraud you put in bogus information, who, but you're a licensee anybody could report you to the DRE and be like that person. So you're still there. It's a self reporting system. If people basically are doing unethical things in there. Well, you still have your what would be unethical about entering your listing that's not lying about lying about what's on the listing. But if you are a licensee, you can't lie without there being potential consequences. Right. I'm just saying the police is it. Yeah. Okay. That's what I'm saying. I do think that there is a. Oh, you're right. I mean, you can't do it. You're right. You can't do it now. Yeah. You can't do it now. I mean, the MLS to police me. In fact, I don't even know when the NLS got policing authority. I think it was with the settlement because prior to that. The NLS in and of itself at least in California is all is already flawed. The data entry is wrong. Some people change their listings depending right away and it stops the days on market count. Some people leave it as as looking what is used to be looking for backup and is an active contingent. And it keeps the day count rolling. So when you're looking at days on market, the data is wrong. Also all the off markets are only sometimes entered in the MLS when somebody wants to for purposes. So it's not like it's tied into the tax records. Now a lot of agents are taking the pictures off. So there's only one exterior picture. I can't even see if it's a comp anymore because I can't see any of the interior pictures. So there are issues already with our MLS, but our profession needs to stop acting like little babies and start acting like the highly trained professionals that we are. And make sure that we are behaving as such. And if we are not just like currently right now to this moment, if I enter incorrect information into the MLS on my blog on my social anywhere else, somebody could report me to the DRE. I honestly don't think the MLS, you know, I entered a try this private. Have you heard of this this new delayed entry thing? No. This was the MLS is rather the NA, NAR's solution to the private listing problem. Yeah. Okay. It's kind of a media in the middle, right? So I have to put it in the MLS, but instead of putting it out right away, which was the previous. Yeah, you can do it. You can delay it. Okay. So I do that. First time I've ever done that. I just did it for really great listing in Granada Hills. Guys. I mean, designer top of the line. So incredible. It's a, it's a large property with a lot of detail, a lot of design detail. 10 photos. They allow us. I'm like, why? Yeah, that's why would you only allow me 10 photos? It's like punitive. It's just really it is. So so when it comes to the Zillow thing, when when this policy first came out when this there are no off market listings policy came out, I was like, finally, finally, because 85% of home buyers look on Zillow, right? We know they most sellers want their house on Zillow. You want your house on Zillow. So it reaches the buyers. They have mastered that platform. And I dropped the ball when they didn't create a different rule book for the hybrid portal. That is what I think it should have. It came up for all of us. We were watching it happen. They're advertising our listings. They're selling our leads. They're using our data. And the lessons are getting paid. We're pissed off. We're vocalizing it. Nobody wants to hear it. Okay. This was the beginning of my barking career. Okay. I'm like, the little guy always the little guy, you know, I spent a lot of money on these images, but I knew I wasn't the only one. I knew everybody kind of felt this way, right? So Zillow's been the bad guy. And then finally, you know, in the past couple of years, now they have to disclose who the listing agent is now people kind of are getting the memo about how things work and Zillow up the game. But I went to NAR and I said, listen, this isn't fair. This loophole creates an in balance in the way that clear cooperation is executed. And I don't think it's great for the consumer that that in balance is there. And it's certainly not great for you're supposed to represent all of us, right? Not just the big guys. So I'm a dues paying number two. I don't think this is fair. And they were like, there's really nothing we can do. I had a whole committee there. They hired a new vice president of strip of industry relations. He kind of turned it over to the MLS committee guy and they were kind of like, listen, you know, we can't really do anything about this because of anti-trust laws. I don't like right. I don't even know how that conceptually works. But this is what they're telling me. So then Zillow does it. And I was like, yes, finally, Zillow's doing what NAR could not do or didn't have the balls to do. I don't even know what they're doing it. And they're standing up for it because they actually believe it's the right thing to do. Right. And so I'm like, NAR should be on the side of Zillow because Zillow is enforcing the clear cooperation policy, which again, I have a major issue with. But at least everybody has to play by the same rules, supposedly, you know, but then again, this loophole is the problem with it because there is a loophole. So Compass is playing by the same rules by creating the private listing network, her the loophole. And you know, it's the pot calling the kettle black 100% and I think it's it's kind of interesting to see these people fighting and then know what's boiling on what's happening down here is this working group of see, I don't know if you saw this news headline, but there's a working group of brokerage owners CEOs who basically went to NAR and said, we need to make some changes. And they kind of their secret, their secret United real estate is Duffy is the only one who's actually come out vocally, but there are articles about what their demands were one of which was getting rid of clear cooperation policy, which NAR for some reason has just been reluctant to do, even though it's caused all of these problems. So what's boiling down here is who gets access to the client first and how like I think the the listing data on some level is going to be democratized like I don't think the private listing is going to work for sellers, at least in a market like this right now, I don't know why you wouldn't want maximum exposure when things are a little harder to sell. Yeah, unless you're celebrity or you need privacy, but even then it doesn't really make sense, but okay, fine, you know, yeah, right it doesn't yeah, I mean, that's that's why my idea of the national listing that were to cover this cover the off market thing. And then if we had an open source MLS, then we really would it need MLS either, I mean. It all be similar to how we trade Bitcoin in a sense like Bitcoin is not regulated and it could be used in nefarious ways, of course, to wander money and things like that, but at the very least anyone can have access to it, it's not really policed. It's kind of self-policed and if people are doing the various things, then government agencies can try to figure out what's going on, but it is open source right and so there is a version of this that could be an MLS a private listing or non-emoral. I mean, right or at least at least in a compromise make one MLS per state. Just one MLS per state wouldn't that be great because we all sell multiple different parts of our state, it's a state license, one MLS per state and open source private listing network that's for nationwide REALTORS and we can all search on that. And there you go. Now, Zillow gets its listings that are on the MLS, we have the right to sell our clients houses off market if we want to. This would be only though if NAR would back off clear cooperation, which they're not even enforcing anymore anyway, which is good. But then when I saw in that in that article about the working group that in 2022 NAR had like $2 billion in the bank. And they have a private capital for profit group. Did you know that? No, it's called second century ventures. Who knew I've been a member of NAR for 20 years. I had no idea. But what this working group is saying is like you guys are going to continually be hit with lawsuits because you have too much money in the bank. Give us our money back. Yeah, that's basically what they said. Give us a rebate. Give us our money back. Every year we ask. And by the way, I'm in Chicago. This is where it's headquartered. And I actually go into that building quite not that that's important. But I go to that building a lot because the local association, which I volunteer at is there. And I don't really ever see NAR because they're on different floors. But we you know, we reach out to them. I'm fairly known here in Chicago, at least to the NAR people who, you know, maybe familiar with the show who work in this area and they have people that work all over the country. But my point is is every year we go to them and say, hey, we want to talk to you guys. And every year they just ignore and I don't understand like I get it. You're busy. I'm not in men. That's fine. But I've got a pretty big audience for your point across. And all of my audience are members. So wouldn't you like to speak directly to members and say, here's what we're doing. Here's what we're up to. I never get a sense of what they're doing or what they're up to. I really don't know what it is. Right. And you know, they have a lot of money. And I'm not saying they're even doing anything wrong. I just want to know what they're doing. That's all I want to know. Well, there's a transparency piece in this too. Listen, I have made the case on my podcast and publicly that I do think we should have an organization. Right. Like there is a reason why we need to lean on each other, learn from each other. Oh, wait. You'll eat around our lobbying efforts. I do think that's valuable. But but in this day and age, the way that if any are not making policies, like the way they govern with a thousand volunteer members, 95 committees, is banana is an unnecessary. If you've ever joined one of these committee calls. You see, I have 100 people on a Zoom, it seems like. It's like, how can anything ever get done? Or how could it not just be group think? I've served on the Board of Directors for LA for a minute and I didn't like the way it worked and they didn't like me either because I kept trying to bring up the transparency issue with the listing brokerage information and they were like, you're in the wrong place, you can go somewhere else and I kept bringing up clear cooperation as an issue and they told me this is not the right venue for that and then I went on in, and I spoke about what I was feeling about that and I got a cease and desist from my own association because they did not want me up there challenging the merits of this policy that has so many flaws in it. And I'm like, this is, on one hand, they'll tell you, if you go to any conferences, they'll say, get involved, get involved, get involved. But once you get involved, they do not want you to think, talk, challenge. They say they do, but my experience is they don't. That's just my experience. It is play ball for sure. 100%. And I'm like, how could it not be if you got all these people who have to come to one agreement on something and there are too many people in the room, it's gonna feel like group think. There's not even enough time on the call to have really challenging opinions. But this is my life, this is my future and it's moving really fast. So I think the idea of holding data to get back to it, this idea of data being precious. That's an OG idea, right? That's how it was prior to the internet, right? The agents were the gatekeepers. We held the listings, we had to give you access to the listings. I think we can throw that out the window. The reality is there's nothing in the MLS that my client cannot see on Redfin or Zillow, right? So I am no longer the gatekeeper. So the only gate that's left is private listings. That's a gate. Yeah. But do we want, does it serve the interest of the seller? If you have to sign a disclosure that says, I understand by doing this, I might not get the best price, I might not get the best terms. I might not have the most clients. Like why would you sign that? Don't sign that, you don't need to do that. There's, it's all smoking mirrors, right? It feels like it to me, especially when you see that the majority of those privately marketed listings end up on the MLS anyway. And that's why it's really... It's just a testing round. It's a marketing ploy and it's also, it's gaming the system, you're like, I can market without days on market. Well, don't we all wish we could do that? You know what I mean? Wouldn't that be amazing? But if you're only marketing to a small group of people, is your market test really a market test? No, the market test is out here. And if you're expert in your field, you have the ability to review the last 30 listings and a half mile radius with similar specs and be able to advise your client on what the range of listing prices are and what the demand will be at the different price points. All that information is also available on almost every platform, on RPR, on Reels Scout. On all these platforms, you can look up the market demand in the area, you do not need to do it that way. So that part feels disingenuous to me. But you know, if a seller says, I wanna market it, I don't wanna have people through, I don't wanna put it on at Christmas. I know that that's a bad time, but I still would sell it at a certain price point if you bring me the buyer. There should be a place for any agent at any brokerage to get that word out. And so I just see a statewide MLS and an open source or not even open source or like the private listing network coming back on board, having a nationwide place for private listings and a statewide MLS and it solves the problem. I'm not even sure I would need local membership, national membership. Did you see Russ Kaffano's op-ed? No, I haven't yet. Oh, that's a good one to read. We should put that link in for your people. I think nationwide private listing it would have to be a non-privatized. It would have to be kind of like how alcoholics anonymous is run. Like there's an open source. But you can't donate to them, you can't give them money. There's no membership fees. There's like everybody chips in a dollar or whatever they pay to be afraid. But it's something where there's no hierarchy, there's no incentive. Like it's just the data and we're just putting it out there and nobody can manipulate it. Isn't that just the way the MLS used to be? To me, our real estate license should be the thing that gives us access to all the things. We shouldn't need to join an MLS and NAR and CAR and Glar just to get a super access. You know what I mean? Why do we have to jump through so many hoops? I don't think we should need to do that when our job is to sell real estate, right? So what we need to do is put our beautiful listings in front of buyers wanting to buy and facilitate that transaction. Let's bring it back to the basics. Keep, I think, keep access as transparent as possible. Honor the seller's choices, yes. But also don't disempower if you really care about the outcome that the seller is going to have. Don't disempower agents at other brokerages from seeing what the seller has to offer. I mean, that just seems like a fiduciary responsibility to me. Otherwise, it's an inherent conflict with fiduciary duties. It's a conflict if all you're trying to do is double in the deal, which is always a problem. Of course. So I just don't understand why everybody wouldn't agree. Private listings are only in the best interests of the seller. If they, if we give it, if we give it the best shot, we possibly can and what does that look like, you know? I just, I think there needs to be an industry place for it. Plus, I wouldn't mind being able to say to buyers and sellers, I do have access to a nationwide private listing. I love it. I love it. That would be great. And then they never feel like, oh, well, I have to go by gun to the head with this agent that I don't even want to go with. But they told me that if I don't go with them, I won't have access to this private listing network. That already has so many potential discriminatory things that I around it. I just don't like it. I don't like it. I'm like for the people, man. I just want everybody to have an option to see what there is out there and have a chance at buying a home that they love and experiencing and seeing the joy of home ownership. Courtney Poulos has been our gosh. She is, you are amazing. She is amazing. And we want to do more of these. So if you like this kind of conversation, which isn't our normal conversation. So for seven years, we mostly talk to top agents saying, tell us your story. We still do that. We love that. We love hearing how agents are doing that and Courtney could do that as well. But I love having her on here to talk about what's currently going on in the industry. And we do this with Chris and Sal as well. But we thought, you know, wouldn't it be fun for Courtney and I to do more of these? So if you want more of this, and maybe we even take your questions live, maybe we interact, we certainly figure something out to where you can participate and be part of the conversation. That would be a lot of our, and you might have an opinion you want to share. We would love to hear from you as well. So let us know. Give us some feedback. If you want to keep this kind of conversation rolling, we can add this to our already lineup of stuff Courtney can add it as well. But I want you everybody to follow her on her YouTube channel, which is Acme Real Estate. You can find all of her the Clean Close podcast episodes, which is newer and it's really opinionated in a good way and takes a position and where as most agents aren't willing to do that. CourtneyPulos.com is where you go to find out all the things Courtney, she speaks, she writes, she has a sub stack, definitely subscribed to that. And she has a brokerage, Acme brokerage in LA. They are amazing. And you know, we were just talking, it was funny. I was talking to her before and I said, do you want more agents? Because I could probably turn on the spiket for you because we have so many listeners. And they're going to want to hang out with you after this episode because of how great you are. And she goes, I don't know. So, so, so, I never know if she wants, you know, because listen, we're quality, not a quantity game. It's a quality game and I just want people who are aligned. I could not agree with you more. But if you are some, maybe you're an agent in a different area and you have people that move in and out of the LA area and you want to just connect with them for referral reasons, yes, definitely reach out. And if you are an agent in the LA area and you do are interested, you know, you never know. Reach out and say, here's what I could offer you, right? But this is, this is the point is, we want more of these conversations. We want to hear the voice of our listeners and Courtney and I can bring that to you. So on behalf of, first of all, on behalf of our listeners, Courtney, thank you for taking your time. We know how busy you are. You are a type A, you're, I don't need, type A isn't even the right term for you. You are just a doer. You do, you've done a lot since the age of 13 is, that's incredible. And a real super.
