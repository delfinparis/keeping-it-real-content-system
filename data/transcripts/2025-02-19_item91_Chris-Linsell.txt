[00:01:13] Today's episode is brought to you by corded.io.
[00:01:17] Are you looking for agents to join your brokerage or team?
[00:01:21] Now, as a real estate recruiter,
[00:01:22] I can tell you the answer is always yes.
[00:01:25] But most agents aren't looking to move right now.
[00:01:28] So how do you know who to contact?
[00:01:30] Well, what if I were to tell you
[00:01:31] there's a recruiting and retention tool
[00:01:33] powered by artificial intelligence
[00:01:35] that shows you exactly which agents in your local market
[00:01:38] are looking to leave their brokerage right now
[00:01:41] and which agents at your own firm
[00:01:43] are also looking to leave you?
[00:01:46] Now, I've been recruiting REALTORS for 15 years
[00:01:48] and I've hired over 2,000 agents.
[00:01:51] I can tell you with no exaggeration,
[00:01:53] this is the tool I've been waiting for.
[00:01:55] Corded's AI looks for trends across dozens of variables
[00:01:58] for each agent in your market
[00:02:00] and shows you which agents they believe are likely to move.
[00:02:03] Not only does it do that,
[00:02:05] but corded's AI went and visited my recruiting website
[00:02:08] and read everything I offer.
[00:02:10] So now when I'm recruiting,
[00:02:12] corded's AI tells me exactly what to say
[00:02:14] based on that agent's needs
[00:02:16] and what my brokerage can offer.
[00:02:18] It even writes emails for me.
[00:02:20] I've never seen anything like it
[00:02:21] and I use it every single day.
[00:02:24] Now, if you are looking to grow your brokerage,
[00:02:27] corded.io is the best tool out there.

[00:04:11] Chris, welcome back to the show.
[00:04:13] DJ, thanks for having me.
[00:04:14] I think we got to cut that intro down a little bit.
[00:04:16] No way.
[00:04:17] I appreciate all of the love,
[00:04:19] but we got things to talk about.
[00:04:22] You don't just want to hear about what I'm about to.
[00:04:25] We got things to get into here.
[00:04:26] Well, let's get right into it.
[00:04:28] Okay.
[00:04:28] Well, I, first of all,
[00:04:31] I think it's a little belated,
[00:04:33] but I haven't really,
[00:04:35] we haven't really had done an episode yet since 2024.
[00:04:39] So happy New Year.
[00:04:40] How's 2025 for you?
[00:04:41] Happy New Year to you.
[00:04:43] It is snowing today in Chicago.
[00:04:45] This is like our first major snow.
[00:04:47] So I don't know what you're dealing with in Michigan.
[00:04:49] So everyone's saying we're getting 10 inches.
[00:04:51] I've lived here 25 years.
[00:04:53] We never get 10 inches.
[00:04:54] We get about three inches.
[00:04:56] It's never a big deal,
[00:04:57] but everyone freaks out.
[00:04:58] So today is the freak out day.
[00:04:59] But generally speaking,
[00:05:01] 2025 has been good for the podcast.
[00:05:04] We're doing live webinars now every month.

[00:05:33] I'm just excited for the spring to warm it up a bit.
[00:05:36] Yeah, amazing.
[00:05:37] Yeah, that's that's great.
[00:05:38] I'm so glad to hear it.
[00:05:40] You know,
[00:05:41] I've been.
[00:05:42] It's been a busy last few months for me.
[00:05:45] I've been all over the place.
[00:05:47] All across the country,
[00:05:48] speaking at different events and getting to connect with real estate
[00:05:52] professionals of all stripes.
[00:05:54] And I mean, there's a lot happening right now in the industry.
[00:06:00] In the markets.
[00:06:01] And frankly,
[00:06:03] when it comes to what's important to real estate professionals,
[00:06:07] you know, the,
[00:06:08] the line keeps moving.
[00:06:10] You know, we keep getting these different kind of watermarks of what's important,
[00:06:15] what's driving change.
[00:06:17] And I guess I'd love to just kind of start off chatting a little bit with you about.
[00:06:24] Some of the continued news.
[00:06:28] And conversation around commissions.
[00:06:33] Let's do it.
[00:06:34] It feels like we are seeing continued downward pressure on general commission amounts.
[00:06:40] I'm seeing the headline.
[00:06:42] The end of six percent commissions thrown across lots of different news outlets with big
[00:06:48] national loans and industries specific ones.
[00:06:52] What are you hearing, DJ, from your position?
[00:06:54] Is this the topic that's coming up with your people?
[00:06:57] What I'm hearing is REALTORS being very nervous about sellers wanting to test the
[00:07:06] waters of not paying a buyer commission.
[00:07:09] So I'm not hearing as much of agents going from six percent down.
[00:07:15] I'm hearing agents saying I'm dealing with sellers who aren't interested in paying the other side.
[00:07:22] And of course, we know now that the buyers has there's a buyer commission agreement that we do beforehand.
[00:07:28] But still it becomes very difficult to sometimes make that transaction work when the buyer now is coming up with
[00:07:35] X amount of money to compensate for, you know, sometimes the seller not wanting to play ball.
[00:07:41] So from a commission perspective, I believe yes, we are seeing some pressure.
[00:07:46] I am seeing more, more 5% commissions than I was seeing 6% in the past.
[00:07:51] Yeah, you know, it's interesting.
[00:07:52] I'm seeing similar.
[00:07:55] I'm seeing similar reactions from from my market and from the markets that I keep a close eye on by virtue of my relationships.
[00:08:03] But I do think that there is more to this story.
[00:08:09] And you know, this is somewhat of an unpopular opinion.
[00:08:12] That's the title of the segment here.
[00:08:15] But commissions are under pressure not just because of lawsuits and because emerging and continuing to change public perception of the work that real
[00:08:28] people's professionals do, there is lots of factors involved here, including the clear cooperation policy.
[00:08:37] And I want to bring this up because not everybody draws a line between clear cooperation and commissions.
[00:08:43] And I think it's important to do so.
[00:08:45] So if you're not going to clear clear cooperation policy, this is the policy and national association of REALTORS has in place that essentially mandates members real toward
[00:08:56] to list a property on the MLS within one business day of beginning to market that property.
[00:09:06] So marketing isn't a bit of a broad term and they interpret it as such.
[00:09:12] But you know, putting aside in the front yard is marketing the property.
[00:09:17] And so there's a post on social media about the property and its price.
[00:09:24] This is marketing the property.
[00:09:26] In fact, there are even interpretations of this policy that don't even include the details.
[00:09:31] You could just have a single photo of the home and some sort of language insinuating that this property is available for inquiries.
[00:09:41] There is a lot of challenge that comes along with this policy.
[00:09:48] And you know, I have personal opinions on this.
[00:09:52] I think well, I'm happy to share at a different time.
[00:09:57] But long story short, the quick cooperation with policy is controversial.
[00:10:02] It is a continued focus of conversation within the industry right now.
[00:10:09] And it is providing some of this lateral pressure on commissions because home sellers, especially, are realizing that if clear cooperation wasn't a mandate, they would have much greater control over how their property is marketed.
[00:10:32] And what the strategy for potentially selling their property would be.
[00:10:38] And by experience, they would have greater control over how commissions get determined and have better confidence in authority as to where those libos commissions go.
[00:10:51] So these are really tangled issues.
[00:10:56] And we don't like to think about them as being related, but the reality is they are.
[00:11:02] Yeah, so what is your take currently on clear, the clear cooperation policy and its relationship to commissions?
[00:11:10] So I think that the clear cooperation policy makes the commission conversation, frankly, more difficult.
[00:11:18] Because when you have a mandate to list a property on the MLS, you also have somewhat of an implied responsibility as a property seller to continue what you believe to be are the traditions, traditional commission levels.
[00:11:38] And I want to make it totally clear. There is no requirement on that.
[00:11:43] We see in major urban markets, maybe some early movers of people moving away from the five or from the six percent commission model, even from the five percent commission model.
[00:11:54] We see early movers away from people offering any buyer compensation at all.
[00:12:01] And all the agents that I talked to are very clear that they are following the letter of the law in terms of making sure that buyer comp agreements and buyer broker agreements are signed.
[00:12:16] And I think that we have all the paperwork in place. The reality is most people are so listing properties like they did a year and a half ago.
[00:12:24] They're still offering a higher side compensation. They're still offering this cooperative package.
[00:12:34] And as such, clear cooperation comes into this because people feel obligated somewhat mentally to follow the playbook that has been in place for 20 years because they're obligated to list on the MLS.
[00:12:53] Everybody else does.
[00:12:55] And I think genuinely speaking, if CCP wasn't this mental or wasn't a mandate in place in its current form, we would see sellers taking control a little bit more over how compensation docs were drafted.
[00:13:14] And that would be a little bit more of an act of compensation.
[00:13:23] Yeah, so if you were an agent right now, what might you do to ensure that your business can run as usual?
[00:13:31] Now that buyers are starting to buyers and sellers are becoming more aware of some of these changes. They're becoming aware that options exist that maybe didn't in the past or at least some are becoming aware.
[00:13:43] So, you know, what do you think? Well, number one, what do you think is going to happen to agents who are part time in the business?
[00:13:52] I'd like to actually let's go to that first because 70 I believe 71% of REALTORS in 2024 across the board 71% across the country did not sell a home.
[00:14:03] Something it's near that number.
[00:14:05] So we have a lot of people with licenses that are not using them.
[00:14:09] What's going to happen number one to those people?
[00:14:12] And then I'd like to ask about the remaining people that are actually actively practicing, you know, what you would suggest to them.
[00:14:19] Yeah, let's let me start off by just kind of amending that stat that you just gave there. It's true 70 70 plus percent of license holders didn't sell a home.
[00:14:29] But of that 70% in nearly half of them nearly half of themselves do not consider real estate to be their profession.
[00:14:39] They're part timers.
[00:14:40] Yeah, right.
[00:14:41] Part timers or they're retired and they're keeping their license as a vehicle for referrals or they, you know, got their license to help their daughter buy a house or whatever the case may be.
[00:14:55] Like let's just call us pay to stay here that that 70 plus percent is like the number of the New York Post loves to grab on to.
[00:15:04] Sure.
[00:15:05] The reality.
[00:15:06] Most people who call this job are selling at least a couple houses every year.
[00:15:12] But some of them some of them are.
[00:15:14] But okay, so let's let's talk about the bottom and the performers.
[00:15:19] Let's talk about that group of the percentage of REALTORS who do consider this a job who are not at break even or above.
[00:15:29] If commission pressure continues.
[00:15:33] If we see, you know, across the board lowering of commission price or commission via this pressure from the market.
[00:15:45] Yeah, you know, some sort of mandate from another lawsuit or from the federal government.
[00:15:52] The people who are operating at the low end of performance.
[00:15:56] The pressure on them to go do something else is going to be incredibly high.
[00:16:02] Yeah, frankly, if commissions go from four to six to four percent, it's going to take 30% more work just to break even where you are right now.
[00:16:15] Most people don't have that.
[00:16:17] So, you know, my, my plan is, if commission slip, we're going to see a colon of the bottom end of this market.
[00:16:26] And I mean, like not five percent of agents, I mean like 25% are gone.
[00:16:35] And I don't mean in five years.
[00:16:37] I mean, we will see that negative membership in the national association of REALTORS for five years in a row.
[00:16:47] Yeah.
[00:16:47] Like it is, is that level of destructive to the bottom end of the market.
[00:16:55] Well, I'll jump in for a second.
[00:16:56] So one of our, our sort of side businesses here at where I work is we have a, you mentioned agents who just hold their license for referrals.
[00:17:06] Those are traditionally called holding companies.
[00:17:08] They're agents that aren't actively practicing.
[00:17:10] They want to keep their license active. They don't do anything with it.
[00:17:13] Personally, they're not working with clients, but they will.
[00:17:16] Hopefully, maybe get a referral. You can still get paid on a referral in a holding company.
[00:17:20] So anyway, just wanted to sort of make that clear for people. I didn't know what that means.
[00:17:24] But here's what's interesting. So I, I started that company.
[00:17:27] Maybe I don't know, 10 years ago.
[00:17:30] Last year, we saw, normally we get about 100 people joining a year.
[00:17:34] We can, we do from all over the state of Illinois, we can take hold people's licenses.
[00:17:38] And last year, we saw no joke, 465 people join our holding company in one calendar year, which means these are people that are really out.
[00:17:48] They're not practicing. They're just going to keep their license with us.
[00:17:51] Pay us a tiny little fee just in the off chance that they get a deal that they can refer or, you know, maybe they'll come back to it, you know, down the road.
[00:17:59] But 400, that was a four times growth multiple.
[00:18:02] And I'm not that great of a marketer where I was able to hit these people four times harder.
[00:18:07] I've literally done the same marketing effort. It runs itself every single day for the last 10 years.
[00:18:13] And last year was a, we just saw a mass Exodus. So this is already starting to happen.
[00:18:17] Wow. And, you know, frankly, like, and my apologies to anyone who this might offend, but good.
[00:18:25] Yeah. This is, this is something the industry, frankly, needs.
[00:18:30] I mean, is in desperate need of, and here's my rationale.
[00:18:35] Why imagine for a minute that football teams just had the, I'm not sure if I'm all out of the same name.
[00:18:45] I'm coming up right now. So we just had the Super Bowl. And I'm, I'm imagine if football teams in the Super Bowl had instead of 53 man rosters, like 53 guys in uniform.
[00:19:02] It might not be 53. So feel free to come at me on the comments. I don't have that right.
[00:19:06] But it's like in the low 50s, this number of people that you put in a uniform for every game.
[00:19:11] Imagine if that was 200. Right. Imagine if you had 250 guys on each side line.
[00:19:21] And 80% of them didn't even not only were they not making on the field.
[00:19:31] Most of them had never played a snap. Right. Most of them don't even know the rules of the game.
[00:19:38] Right. I mean, it sounds, it sounds, I recognize it sounds pretty straightforward and a little assertive here.
[00:19:47] That is the state of the real estate industry when it comes to that bottom of morning 70% or 30% or whatever that number is of people who are professionals, but are not closing any business.
[00:19:59] These are folks who are not representing the industry well because they haven't taken time to figure out how to invest in their own performance and thus create opportunities for themselves.
[00:20:14] Of course, there's always going to be. There's always going to be people who try really hard, know who educated themselves who worked really hard to build these connections.
[00:20:24] And stuff is just not working out for them. If that's you, I would love to help you.
[00:20:30] To DM me on LinkedIn, I will give you some great advice that is helpful for you.
[00:20:36] But I am confident I'm not going to get many of those DMs because most of the people who are in that bottom performing, they're just not taking a seriously.
[00:20:45] They're just not doing this the way it's supposed to be done and thus if we saw that commission compression, the lower portion of this market is really going to feel it.
[00:20:58] And we're going to feel it, especially by virtue of this Exodus of these folks.
[00:21:03] Now, I want to point over for a second because let's talk about the hyper performance.
[00:21:07] The hyper performers, they're not going to feel this at all. In fact, this is going to be a reason for them to not only update their marketing with reasons why I still charge 6%.
[00:21:24] I know that sounds paradoxical, but here we have a clear identification of aligned in the sand that has been drawn between those who are worth it, those who are and those who are worth it are going to start saying, yeah, you pay me a premium price because I sold 11 homes just like yours in the last 24 months.
[00:21:50] I sold 1100 homes in this market for me and my team have in the last 11 years.
[00:21:59] I know the people who are stocking these homes, I know the agents that represent them. I know the banks that represent the mortgages that are used to purchase these sorts of homes.
[00:22:10] I know stuff like, yeah, we've all got access to my last, but I got the good. I know I've spent time getting into these markets in places that isn't available on the first page of Google.
[00:22:25] I'm worth it. I'm worth it. This is another reason why clear cooperation as it stands right now, if it is amended or is going to be an accelerator towards creating a more succinct high end high performance portion of the real estate market.
[00:22:46] And that's going to be reflected in the financials as well.
[00:22:49] Yeah, I'll tell you too. I talk to a lot of obviously my podcast. I interview top 1%ers. Not one of them has mentioned a concern around commissions and I ask them, usually sometimes off camera, but I say, Hey, what are you seeing? Are you seeing compression? They say, not yet.
[00:23:04] But we're not seeing that. And in fact, you know, again, the Exodus of the lower performers just gives opportunity for them to gobble up market share.
[00:23:12] Totally 100%. And frankly, like that is the, that is the kind of the dirty little secret that nobody really talks about here. But if you do the math on it, it's pretty obvious.
[00:23:23] Like, let's say that, you know, that bottom 50% that is closing very few deals.
[00:23:31] They're still closing some deals like, and that bottom portion when they exit the market, somebody's going to need to take over that 15% of transactions that they were representing.
[00:23:45] And so, I want to just like wrap up this little conversation package with a little bow to say, the real opportunity here is for certainly for high performers.
[00:24:00] You've got like table is set for you. You've got the map in tucked in your shirt. Like it's time for you to eat kind of thing.
[00:24:06] The real opportunity is for those mid market performers who are capable and competent and experienced, but they don't have that big broad market appeal yet.
[00:24:21] Right now is a time where you should be working on figuring out how to capture some of that lost inventory.
[00:24:30] So that it doesn't just flow to the people who are going to show up, you know, at the top of the performance results in your market rankings.
[00:24:40] Like, there is going to be a force for that inventory that gets abandoned by these low performers that leave the industry.
[00:24:48] There's going to be a portion of that inventory that is going to be niche specific.
[00:24:53] It's going to be condo sellers. It's going to be first time home sellers. It's going to be vacant land sellers. It's going to be, I mean, you name the issue.
[00:25:02] Right now, there's an opportunity for if you haven't yet, is to dig deep into one of those niches so that you can be always to capture some of that abandoned inventory.
[00:25:13] Because otherwise, it's just going to be captured by the big name celebrities in your market. Everybody knows who those agents are.
[00:25:20] Right now, you can capture some of that. You've got to do the work now to get yourself ready for it.
[00:25:24] Here's a quick action step for those in that middle market that don't want to lose market share to the higher performers. Here's what you do or here's a suggestion for what I would do if I were you.
[00:25:34] Number one, I would subscribe to chat GBT. It's $20 a month. It's totally, you know, a reasonable thing for what I'm about to tell you.
[00:25:42] You're going to go there and you're going to ask it to pretend it's a customer, whether a buy side or sell side customer.
[00:25:49] And you are going to say, drill me. I, I, and you can speak to it. So you don't have to type.
[00:25:53] You can literally speak and say, throw every objection at me about why I should go with you, DJ, middle tier performer without all the accolades that the big, the big people in my industry, my the celebrities in my market have.
[00:26:06] And tell me, and when I'm giving you an uncompaling reason, non compelling reason, you correct me and tell me what a better solution would be, have it grade you.
[00:26:15] You could do this every day for 10 minutes within 30 days. You will be unstoppable in your pitch. Don't even worry about, I don't know what to say.
[00:26:23] I think that's a great way to say, chat GBT will help you with it there. It will, and you can even find language models that have already been trained on this.
[00:26:30] You can literally search. I found a language model that's trained on the Gottman relationship stuff. So I ask it, I go, I'm having this challenge with my relationship.
[00:26:37] And I'm like, what would the Gottman say? And it literally tells me what they would suggest I do. You can do this in real estate for $20 a month. You're almost like getting a real time coach. And you can practice this all day long.
[00:26:49] Totally, totally, I love this idea. It is super helpful.
[00:26:55] And you know, I admittedly, you know, I'm a tech guy. So I'm really, I'm into this stuff, just kind of naturally. I talk to chat GBT, not joking every day.
[00:27:07] Me too.
[00:27:07] I have taken the time. And I know this is an option for everybody. But for me, I have 30 minutes in the morning that is commute time where I'm taking my kids to and from school.
[00:27:22] I used to spend that time listening to podcasts or talking to my mom on the phone, chat about Mary Ann, how are you?
[00:27:30] So I used to spend this time, you know, wasting it, but not being super productive either.
[00:27:39] Now I put the voice prompt for chat GBT on and I use it to talk through ideas.
[00:27:45] And it's the, I mean, our transcripts, like all of it is right there on my phone.
[00:27:51] When I get back to the office after my commute time, I just take those transcripts, drop them into a work doc. And then I feed it back to chat GBT.
[00:28:01] Or I'll just have to get GBT summarized everything that we talked about and give it the action steps. Then I drop that into into into to do is. And I've got a jumpstart on my day.
[00:28:11] And I've had a chance to talk through my ideas with my personal assistant.
[00:28:17] Absolutely. So this is a place to give your ideas, ask for help. I'm struggling in this part of my real estate business.
[00:28:25] Hey, chat GBT, search everywhere you can and come up with 10 good ideas for me. And I'll tell you, we'll do them one by one.
[00:28:32] You'll give it to me. I'll tell you if I think that's a good idea. It will continually learn, get reinforced on the good and non-reinforced on the bat.
[00:28:39] And you will, this will literally transform your business. It's like having a best friend who is also going to help you along the way. It never says no. It never says I can't do it.
[00:28:51] It sometimes gives you bad info, but that's okay. You tell it, hey, that's not correct. That doesn't work for me and it's self correct. So great suggestion.
[00:28:58] Yeah, I'm glad that you like it as well.
[00:29:00] It's super cool. I think it is, I think it was game changing.
[00:29:04] Let's tease the next episode because I think we're bumping up against sort of the end of what we wanted to do. I think we talked about a lot.
[00:29:12] Here's what Chris mentioned this to me and I'd forgotten because I just got to very fortunate. I got to sit in on Dr. Lawrence Unis, the National Association of REALTORS Chief Economist. He's the guy.
[00:29:23] He's the number one guy in the industry really has the data that no one else has. And he was presenting going, here's what's going on. And I won't, I don't have much to report other than one statistic that I'd forgotten that Chris reminded me of, which is the average first time home owner is gone up in age significantly.
[00:29:42] Chris, I know you were saying I think it went from 35 the previous year or two. Now it's up to 37 or 38. Why is that relevant? So here's what Dr. Unis said. Why this is relevant is we know that home prices traditionally over time over long swaths of time, but increase in value.
[00:29:59] We, we, the data is there. You can look it up. And we also know that when people start later, they have, you know, they're losing opportunity to generate, you know, possible long term wealth.
[00:30:10] So this is a problem, not just for REALTORS. This is a problem for the people who are renting. Now we understand why people are renting. There's a lot of reasons why people choose to rent.
[00:30:21] But I think as a REALTOR, this is massive opportunity to start educating people as early as you can to have them recognize you have a massive opportunity. Most of your peers aren't paying attention to this.
[00:30:33] This is as significant as putting in your 401k money, putting in your Roth IRA or your traditional IRA money. This is these are opportunities. So we're going to maybe talk about that next episode. So what can we do to take advantage of this growing trend?
[00:30:46] And what are the, maybe what are the, what are the pros of waiting till you're 37? Maybe there's some good reasons to do that that that you can explore as an agent, but you, we're going to talk about this at length.
[00:30:58] And also we want to know what else you guys want to hear about. So when I say guys, of course, men and women, I apologize, that's an old old saying that I need to get rid of.
[00:31:05] But our audience, we appreciate you. We do this for you. So please let us know what would you like Chris to talk about? He's an expert. He speaks all over the country. Chris, are you, do you have any upcoming speaking engagements or can you share with us where you just recently were?
[00:31:19] Yeah, I do have recent, my most recently, most recent stuff was some private consulting that can't do a ton of talking about here, but it is a good opportunity to remind folks that if you, your team or your brokerage or your company, want to talk about how you can better position yourself to serve your clients, integrate technology into your daily practices.
[00:31:44] I love to be a part of that conversation. If you are looking to get a little personal and sell in your life and you happen to be a real estate one agent coming to your annual conference in beautiful Detroit, Michigan, just a couple of weeks here. So comes to Detroit, real estate one, I'll be talking about AI, I'll be talking about the application of this incredible technology.
[00:32:07] I'll be talking about the application of your day, your day is eight months and years. This is a successful real estate professional. It's going to be awesome. I can't wait.
[00:32:16] Awesome. Chris Lincel.com is where he can learn about Chris. You can also follow him on Twitter, all of his social media is there. You can follow with him, ask him questions, engage with him. He appreciates it. This is his passion outside of his family. It was number one. And this is number two. So please reach out to him, let him know what you think of his, his, his,
[00:32:36] his, being a guest on our show. He's been with us for gosh, I don't know how many years now we love him. We love him.

DJ, thanks for having me. I think we got to cut that intro down a little bit. No way. I appreciate all of the love, but we got things to talk about. You don't just want to hear about what I'm about to. We got things to get into here. Well, let's get right into it. Okay. Well, I, first of all, I think it's a little belated, but I haven't really, we haven't really had done an episode yet since 2024. So happy New Year. How's 2025 for you? Happy New Year to you. It is snowing today in Chicago. This is like our first major snow. So I don't know what you're dealing with in Michigan. So everyone's saying we're getting 10 inches. I've lived here 25 years. We never get 10 inches. We get about three inches. It's never a big deal, but everyone freaks out. So today is the freak out day. But generally speaking, 2025 has been good for the podcast. We're doing live webinars now every month. Speaking of which, we have one coming up on February 25th. Totally free for our listeners. Go to keepingitrealwebinar.com. We have three sessions for you. We have a top 1% producer. We have a real estate coach doing a session with a national association of REALTORS 30 under 30 winner. And we have Kim Rippberg, who is an ex netflix exec talking about video. And totally free for you guys. So keepingitrealwebinar.com. Limited seats. Go there now. But yeah, good so far. I'm just excited for the spring to warm it up a bit. Yeah, amazing. Yeah, that's that's great. I'm so glad to hear it. You know, I've been. It's been a busy last few months for me. I've been all over the place. All across the country, speaking at different events and getting to connect with real estate professionals of all stripes. And I mean, there's a lot happening right now in the industry. In the markets. And frankly, when it comes to what's important to real estate professionals, you know, the, the line keeps moving. You know, we keep getting these different kind of watermarks of what's important, what's driving change. And I guess I'd love to just kind of start off chatting a little bit with you about. Some of the continued news. And conversation around commissions. Let's do it. It feels like we are seeing continued downward pressure on general commission amounts. I'm seeing the headline. The end of six percent commissions thrown across lots of different news outlets with big national loans and industries specific ones. What are you hearing, DJ, from your position? Is this the topic that's coming up with your people? What I'm hearing is REALTORS being very nervous about sellers wanting to test the waters of not paying a buyer commission. So I'm not hearing as much of agents going from six percent down. I'm hearing agents saying I'm dealing with sellers who aren't interested in paying the other side. And of course, we know now that the buyers has there's a buyer commission agreement that we do beforehand. But still it becomes very difficult to sometimes make that transaction work when the buyer now is coming up with X amount of money to compensate for, you know, sometimes the seller not wanting to play ball. So from a commission perspective, I believe yes, we are seeing some pressure. I am seeing more, more 5% commissions than I was seeing 6% in the past. Yeah, you know, it's interesting. I'm seeing similar. I'm seeing similar reactions from from my market and from the markets that I keep a close eye on by virtue of my relationships. But I do think that there is more to this story. And you know, this is somewhat of an unpopular opinion. That's the title of the segment here. But commissions are under pressure not just because of lawsuits and because emerging and continuing to change public perception of the work that real people's professionals do, there is lots of factors involved here, including the clear cooperation policy. And I want to bring this up because not everybody draws a line between clear cooperation and commissions. And I think it's important to do so. So if you're not going to clear clear cooperation policy, this is the policy and national association of REALTORS has in place that essentially mandates members real toward to list a property on the MLS within one business day of beginning to market that property. So marketing isn't a bit of a broad term and they interpret it as such. But you know, putting aside in the front yard is marketing the property. And so there's a post on social media about the property and its price. This is marketing the property. In fact, there are even interpretations of this policy that don't even include the details. You could just have a single photo of the home and some sort of language insinuating that this property is available for inquiries. There is a lot of challenge that comes along with this policy. And you know, I have personal opinions on this. I think well, I'm happy to share at a different time. But long story short, the quick cooperation with policy is controversial. It is a continued focus of conversation within the industry right now. And it is providing some of this lateral pressure on commissions because home sellers, especially, are realizing that if clear cooperation wasn't a mandate, they would have much greater control over how their property is marketed. And what the strategy for potentially selling their property would be. And by experience, they would have greater control over how commissions get determined and have better confidence in authority as to where those libos commissions go. So these are really tangled issues. And we don't like to think about them as being related, but the reality is they are. Yeah, so what is your take currently on clear, the clear cooperation policy and its relationship to commissions? So I think that the clear cooperation policy makes the commission conversation, frankly, more difficult. Because when you have a mandate to list a property on the MLS, you also have somewhat of an implied responsibility as a property seller to continue what you believe to be are the traditions, traditional commission levels. And I want to make it totally clear. There is no requirement on that. We see in major urban markets, maybe some early movers of people moving away from the five or from the six percent commission model, even from the five percent commission model. We see early movers away from people offering any buyer compensation at all. And all the agents that I talked to are very clear that they are following the letter of the law in terms of making sure that buyer comp agreements and buyer broker agreements are signed. And I think that we have all the paperwork in place. The reality is most people are so listing properties like they did a year and a half ago. They're still offering a higher side compensation. They're still offering this cooperative package. And as such, clear cooperation comes into this because people feel obligated somewhat mentally to follow the playbook that has been in place for 20 years because they're obligated to list on the MLS. Everybody else does. And I think genuinely speaking, if CCP wasn't this mental or wasn't a mandate in place in its current form, we would see sellers taking control a little bit more over how compensation docs were drafted. And that would be a little bit more of an act of compensation. Yeah, so if you were an agent right now, what might you do to ensure that your business can run as usual? Now that buyers are starting to buyers and sellers are becoming more aware of some of these changes. They're becoming aware that options exist that maybe didn't in the past or at least some are becoming aware. So, you know, what do you think? Well, number one, what do you think is going to happen to agents who are part time in the business? I'd like to actually let's go to that first because 70 I believe 71% of REALTORS in 2024 across the board 71% across the country did not sell a home. Something it's near that number. So we have a lot of people with licenses that are not using them. What's going to happen number one to those people? And then I'd like to ask about the remaining people that are actually actively practicing, you know, what you would suggest to them. Yeah, let's let me start off by just kind of amending that stat that you just gave there. It's true 70 70 plus percent of license holders didn't sell a home. But of that 70% in nearly half of them nearly half of themselves do not consider real estate to be their profession. They're part timers. Yeah, right. Part timers or they're retired and they're keeping their license as a vehicle for referrals or they, you know, got their license to help their daughter buy a house or whatever the case may be. Like let's just call us pay to stay here that that 70 plus percent is like the number of the New York Post loves to grab on to. Sure. The reality. Most people who call this job are selling at least a couple houses every year. But some of them some of them are. But okay, so let's let's talk about the bottom and the performers. Let's talk about that group of the percentage of REALTORS who do consider this a job who are not at break even or above. If commission pressure continues. If we see, you know, across the board lowering of commission price or commission via this pressure from the market. Yeah, you know, some sort of mandate from another lawsuit or from the federal government. The people who are operating at the low end of performance. The pressure on them to go do something else is going to be incredibly high. Yeah, frankly, if commissions go from four to six to four percent, it's going to take 30% more work just to break even where you are right now. Most people don't have that. So, you know, my, my plan is, if commission slip, we're going to see a colon of the bottom end of this market. And I mean, like not five percent of agents, I mean like 25% are gone. And I don't mean in five years. I mean, we will see that negative membership in the national association of REALTORS for five years in a row. Yeah. Like it is, is that level of destructive to the bottom end of the market. Well, I'll jump in for a second. So one of our, our sort of side businesses here at where I work is we have a, you mentioned agents who just hold their license for referrals. Those are traditionally called holding companies. They're agents that aren't actively practicing. They want to keep their license active. They don't do anything with it. Personally, they're not working with clients, but they will. Hopefully, maybe get a referral. You can still get paid on a referral in a holding company. So anyway, just wanted to sort of make that clear for people. I didn't know what that means. But here's what's interesting. So I, I started that company. Maybe I don't know, 10 years ago. Last year, we saw, normally we get about 100 people joining a year. We can, we do from all over the state of Illinois, we can take hold people's licenses. And last year, we saw no joke, 465 people join our holding company in one calendar year, which means these are people that are really out. They're not practicing. They're just going to keep their license with us. Pay us a tiny little fee just in the off chance that they get a deal that they can refer or, you know, maybe they'll come back to it, you know, down the road. But 400, that was a four times growth multiple. And I'm not that great of a marketer where I was able to hit these people four times harder. I've literally done the same marketing effort. It runs itself every single day for the last 10 years. And last year was a, we just saw a mass Exodus. So this is already starting to happen. Wow. And, you know, frankly, like, and my apologies to anyone who this might offend, but good. Yeah. This is, this is something the industry, frankly, needs. I mean, is in desperate need of, and here's my rationale. Why imagine for a minute that football teams just had the, I'm not sure if I'm all out of the same name. I'm coming up right now. So we just had the Super Bowl. And I'm, I'm imagine if football teams in the Super Bowl had instead of 53 man rosters, like 53 guys in uniform. It might not be 53. So feel free to come at me on the comments. I don't have that right. But it's like in the low 50s, this number of people that you put in a uniform for every game. Imagine if that was 200. Right. Imagine if you had 250 guys on each side line. And 80% of them didn't even not only were they not making on the field. Most of them had never played a snap. Right. Most of them don't even know the rules of the game. Right. I mean, it sounds, it sounds, I recognize it sounds pretty straightforward and a little assertive here. That is the state of the real estate industry when it comes to that bottom of morning 70% or 30% or whatever that number is of people who are professionals, but are not closing any business. These are folks who are not representing the industry well because they haven't taken time to figure out how to invest in their own performance and thus create opportunities for themselves. Of course, there's always going to be. There's always going to be people who try really hard, know who educated themselves who worked really hard to build these connections. And stuff is just not working out for them. If that's you, I would love to help you. To DM me on LinkedIn, I will give you some great advice that is helpful for you. But I am confident I'm not going to get many of those DMs because most of the people who are in that bottom performing, they're just not taking a seriously. They're just not doing this the way it's supposed to be done and thus if we saw that commission compression, the lower portion of this market is really going to feel it. And we're going to feel it, especially by virtue of this Exodus of these folks. Now, I want to point over for a second because let's talk about the hyper performance. The hyper performers, they're not going to feel this at all. In fact, this is going to be a reason for them to not only update their marketing with reasons why I still charge 6%. I know that sounds paradoxical, but here we have a clear identification of aligned in the sand that has been drawn between those who are worth it, those who are and those who are worth it are going to start saying, yeah, you pay me a premium price because I sold 11 homes just like yours in the last 24 months. I sold 1100 homes in this market for me and my team have in the last 11 years. I know the people who are stocking these homes, I know the agents that represent them. I know the banks that represent the mortgages that are used to purchase these sorts of homes. I know stuff like, yeah, we've all got access to my last, but I got the good. I know I've spent time getting into these markets in places that isn't available on the first page of Google. I'm worth it. I'm worth it. This is another reason why clear cooperation as it stands right now, if it is amended or is going to be an accelerator towards creating a more succinct high end high performance portion of the real estate market. And that's going to be reflected in the financials as well. Yeah, I'll tell you too. I talk to a lot of obviously my podcast. I interview top 1%ers. Not one of them has mentioned a concern around commissions and I ask them, usually sometimes off camera, but I say, Hey, what are you seeing? Are you seeing compression? They say, not yet. But we're not seeing that. And in fact, you know, again, the Exodus of the lower performers just gives opportunity for them to gobble up market share. Totally 100%. And frankly, like that is the, that is the kind of the dirty little secret that nobody really talks about here. But if you do the math on it, it's pretty obvious. Like, let's say that, you know, that bottom 50% that is closing very few deals. They're still closing some deals like, and that bottom portion when they exit the market, somebody's going to need to take over that 15% of transactions that they were representing. And so, I want to just like wrap up this little conversation package with a little bow to say, the real opportunity here is for certainly for high performers. You've got like table is set for you. You've got the map in tucked in your shirt. Like it's time for you to eat kind of thing. The real opportunity is for those mid market performers who are capable and competent and experienced, but they don't have that big broad market appeal yet. Right now is a time where you should be working on figuring out how to capture some of that lost inventory. So that it doesn't just flow to the people who are going to show up, you know, at the top of the performance results in your market rankings. Like, there is going to be a force for that inventory that gets abandoned by these low performers that leave the industry. There's going to be a portion of that inventory that is going to be niche specific. It's going to be condo sellers. It's going to be first time home sellers. It's going to be vacant land sellers. It's going to be, I mean, you name the issue. Right now, there's an opportunity for if you haven't yet, is to dig deep into one of those niches so that you can be always to capture some of that abandoned inventory. Because otherwise, it's just going to be captured by the big name celebrities in your market. Everybody knows who those agents are. Right now, you can capture some of that. You've got to do the work now to get yourself ready for it. Here's a quick action step for those in that middle market that don't want to lose market share to the higher performers. Here's what you do or here's a suggestion for what I would do if I were you. Number one, I would subscribe to chat GBT. It's $20 a month. It's totally, you know, a reasonable thing for what I'm about to tell you. You're going to go there and you're going to ask it to pretend it's a customer, whether a buy side or sell side customer. And you are going to say, drill me. I, I, and you can speak to it. So you don't have to type. You can literally speak and say, throw every objection at me about why I should go with you, DJ, middle tier performer without all the accolades that the big, the big people in my industry, my the celebrities in my market have. And tell me, and when I'm giving you an uncompaling reason, non compelling reason, you correct me and tell me what a better solution would be, have it grade you. You could do this every day for 10 minutes within 30 days. You will be unstoppable in your pitch. Don't even worry about, I don't know what to say. I think that's a great way to say, chat GBT will help you with it there. It will, and you can even find language models that have already been trained on this. You can literally search. I found a language model that's trained on the Gottman relationship stuff. So I ask it, I go, I'm having this challenge with my relationship. And I'm like, what would the Gottman say? And it literally tells me what they would suggest I do. You can do this in real estate for $20 a month. You're almost like getting a real time coach. And you can practice this all day long. Totally, totally, I love this idea. It is super helpful. And you know, I admittedly, you know, I'm a tech guy. So I'm really, I'm into this stuff, just kind of naturally. I talk to chat GBT, not joking every day. Me too. I have taken the time. And I know this is an option for everybody. But for me, I have 30 minutes in the morning that is commute time where I'm taking my kids to and from school. I used to spend that time listening to podcasts or talking to my mom on the phone, chat about Mary Ann, how are you? So I used to spend this time, you know, wasting it, but not being super productive either. Now I put the voice prompt for chat GBT on and I use it to talk through ideas. And it's the, I mean, our transcripts, like all of it is right there on my phone. When I get back to the office after my commute time, I just take those transcripts, drop them into a work doc. And then I feed it back to chat GBT. Or I'll just have to get GBT summarized everything that we talked about and give it the action steps. Then I drop that into into into to do is. And I've got a jumpstart on my day. And I've had a chance to talk through my ideas with my personal assistant. Absolutely. So this is a place to give your ideas, ask for help. I'm struggling in this part of my real estate business. Hey, chat GBT, search everywhere you can and come up with 10 good ideas for me. And I'll tell you, we'll do them one by one. You'll give it to me. I'll tell you if I think that's a good idea. It will continually learn, get reinforced on the good and non-reinforced on the bat. And you will, this will literally transform your business. It's like having a best friend who is also going to help you along the way. It never says no. It never says I can't do it. It sometimes gives you bad info, but that's okay. You tell it, hey, that's not correct. That doesn't work for me and it's self correct. So great suggestion. Yeah, I'm glad that you like it as well. It's super cool. I think it is, I think it was game changing. Let's tease the next episode because I think we're bumping up against sort of the end of what we wanted to do. I think we talked about a lot. Here's what Chris mentioned this to me and I'd forgotten because I just got to very fortunate. I got to sit in on Dr. Lawrence Unis, the National Association of REALTORS Chief Economist. He's the guy. He's the number one guy in the industry really has the data that no one else has. And he was presenting going, here's what's going on. And I won't, I don't have much to report other than one statistic that I'd forgotten that Chris reminded me of, which is the average first time home owner is gone up in age significantly. Chris, I know you were saying I think it went from 35 the previous year or two. Now it's up to 37 or 38. Why is that relevant? So here's what Dr. Unis said. Why this is relevant is we know that home prices traditionally over time over long swaths of time, but increase in value. We, we, the data is there. You can look it up. And we also know that when people start later, they have, you know, they're losing opportunity to generate, you know, possible long term wealth. So this is a problem, not just for REALTORS. This is a problem for the people who are renting. Now we understand why people are renting. There's a lot of reasons why people choose to rent. But I think as a REALTOR, this is massive opportunity to start educating people as early as you can to have them recognize you have a massive opportunity. Most of your peers aren't paying attention to this. This is as significant as putting in your 401k money, putting in your Roth IRA or your traditional IRA money. This is these are opportunities. So we're going to maybe talk about that next episode. So what can we do to take advantage of this growing trend? And what are the, maybe what are the, what are the pros of waiting till you're 37? Maybe there's some good reasons to do that that that you can explore as an agent, but you, we're going to talk about this at length. And also we want to know what else you guys want to hear about. So when I say guys, of course, men and women, I apologize, that's an old old saying that I need to get rid of. But our audience, we appreciate you. We do this for you. So please let us know what would you like Chris to talk about? He's an expert. He speaks all over the country. Chris, are you, do you have any upcoming speaking engagements or can you share with us where you just recently were? Yeah, I do have recent, my most recently, most recent stuff was some private consulting that can't do a ton of talking about here, but it is a good opportunity to remind folks that if you, your team or your brokerage or your company, want to talk about how you can better position yourself to serve your clients, integrate technology into your daily practices. I love to be a part of that conversation.
