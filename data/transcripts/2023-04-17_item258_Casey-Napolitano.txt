[00:05:29] Thank you so much for having me.
[00:05:31] I am very excited to speak to you because you are the great granddaughter of one of the
[00:05:37] best.
[00:05:38] I am sorry because we are going to get to your superstar to very shortly.
[00:05:42] I want to go all the way back to your great grandfather.
[00:05:45] In fact, I almost just took some of your thunder away.
[00:05:50] I have...
[00:05:51] Well, we will get to this.
[00:05:53] But Casey has a very impressive family history and something that I was telling her offline.
[00:05:59] Let's let the audience in on everything.
[00:06:01] Let's go all the way back to the very beginning because I would love to know you are real estate
[00:06:06] career.
[00:06:07] Obviously, you have your own story but you actually go back several generations.
[00:06:12] I would love to hear about how real estate was part of your family for all these years.
[00:06:17] Yes.
[00:06:18] Growing up, I moved five times with my parents because they were always buying homes and
[00:06:25] fixing them up and selling them.
[00:06:27] I just were constantly moving in my younger years.
[00:06:31] I was just like, wow, this is at a young age.
[00:06:34] It really fascinated me.
[00:06:37] Then I had my great grandpa, Vern Winchel, who founded Winchel's Donuts.
[00:06:42] I never really thought anything of it.
[00:06:46] Honestly, probably until I went to college, did I know how big of a thing that was.
[00:06:52] I like to bring it up now because people think it's fun.
[00:06:55] He also did real estate.
[00:06:58] I feel like he had dozens of homes all over.
[00:07:02] It was always so cool to me.
[00:07:05] Real estate in general that you could just be your own boss and find deals.
[00:07:11] Every kind of deal is just so different.
[00:07:13] You could just decide what you want to do.
[00:07:16] Then my parents, when I was around 10, I remember they bought a apartment building that needed
[00:07:23] everything.
[00:07:24] It was just a wreck.
[00:07:25] I watched them redo all the units and still to this day.
[00:07:30] If they get a vacancy, I'll come in and I'll fix it up so they can get more rent.
[00:07:34] I've become the design person of the family.
[00:07:39] Growing up, my dad did probate auctions and also new home sales auctions all over the
[00:07:45] country.
[00:07:46] We even went to Portugal at one point.
[00:07:48] I worked for him from a young age.
[00:07:49] I think I started working his auctions at maybe 10 or 11 years old.
[00:07:57] They're called probate auctions.
[00:08:00] He would get certain amount of properties every couple of months and then the auction would
[00:08:07] be out front of the house.
[00:08:08] The house would be sold as is and I really would have a bitter card and there would be no
[00:08:13] contingencies at all.
[00:08:15] You're buying all this stuff.
[00:08:18] That's it.
[00:08:19] You get what you get and it was so exciting.
[00:08:21] It was just super fun.
[00:08:23] Then at one point, he was doing a lot of new home sales.
[00:08:28] We would go to Seattle and there would be 50 condo units that weren't selling and he
[00:08:35] would come and do a new marketing program and we would sell 50 units in one day in a hotel
[00:08:40] bar.
[00:08:41] It was super fun.
[00:08:42] It was super cool.
[00:08:43] It was different.
[00:08:45] Then my mom, she still works out Rodeo Realty in Calabasis and she does high in homes and
[00:08:52] then my grandma growing up, her name is Brenda Winchell.
[00:08:56] She would be driving around with her red nails and her platinum blonde hair and she would
[00:09:01] be taking notes on her hands.
[00:09:03] I'll never forget it.
[00:09:04] She would always have notes on her hands looking for the next property to sell her clients.
[00:09:10] Also, my Aunt Mimi was a big time agent in Hollywood.
[00:09:14] I was kind of like, I kind of like had to do it because I knew so much about it that it
[00:09:21] was like, if I don't do this, I'm going to really like start fresh somewhere else.
[00:09:27] I went to Pepperdine for writing for journalism and then I was like, I think I turned 18.
[00:09:33] I got my real estate license, my salesperson license and then should I just go keep going
[00:09:38] or?
[00:09:39] No, this is excellent.
[00:09:42] This is excellent.
[00:09:42] I was just, no, yes.
[00:09:43] I mean, all of this is great.
[00:09:45] I was thinking when you said Pepperdine, I remember Pepperdine is like right on the water,
[00:09:49] too, isn't it?
[00:09:50] It's amazing.
[00:09:52] 
[00:09:52] Yeah.
[00:09:52] It's so sick.
[00:09:53] It's amazing.
[00:09:53] 
[00:09:53] If your child ever wants to go to Pepperdine, they are going to have an incredible, is it Malibu
[00:10:00] or it's near Malibu?
[00:10:00] It's Malibu.
[00:10:01] It's Malibu.
[00:10:02] Yeah.
[00:10:02] Yeah.
[00:10:03] Yeah.
[00:10:03] I have some friends that went there and they said, anyway, but aside from that, so it's
[00:10:08] either donuts or real estate.
[00:10:10] You had to go into one of those, one of those two industries and...
[00:10:13] Exactly.
[00:10:14] Yeah.
[00:10:14] Yeah.
[00:10:15] And by the way, if anyone, there are still a few winchels stores or shops, where are
[00:10:20] they?
[00:10:20] For anyone out there, because if you haven't had a winchels donut, I have had one.
[00:10:24] They are incredible.
[00:10:25] They are literally the best donuts you'll ever have.
[00:10:27] Where can they find them in SoCal?
[00:10:29] So in Los Angeles, there's one in Tarzana, off a recida right off the freeway, and then
[00:10:35] there's one on Melrose in Hollywood.
[00:10:37] Oh, I think there might be one on Vine Still, but back in the day, there were every exit.
[00:10:43] Every exit off the one on one, there was a winchels donuts.
[00:10:46] And still to this day, if you see a donut shop and the sign is shaped like a triangle,
[00:10:52] you know it was a winchels at some point.
[00:10:54] So back in the 80s, when he sold the whole company, he was like, oh, I'm sorry.
[00:10:59] I'm not saying anything to yummy omdonuts, you would start seeing that they would just
[00:11:03] keep the sign, but then just a new name was on it.
[00:11:07] Well, that was that that's a very big brand.
[00:11:09] And so you know, I would I, but I know a lot of our audience might be thinking is she grew
[00:11:15] up in a real estate family.
[00:11:17] This is all going, this is all must be so easy for her because she's just been involved
[00:11:22] with it for her entire life.
[00:11:24] And it goes back generations.
[00:11:26] You have grandparents and great grandparents.
[00:11:27] And in fact, I do want to make a point, your great grandfather who did start winchels donuts
[00:11:32] had said, yes, that's my business, but real estate is really the best investment.
[00:11:39] And he really, he really hammered that into the family, right?
[00:11:41] So the idea was the donuts were what paid the bills, but then also wanting to build sort
[00:11:47] of multi generational wealth through through these real estate investments.
[00:11:51] And it obviously spread to like every member of your family.
[00:11:55] Exactly.
[00:11:56] 100% for sure.
[00:11:58] So you and you've been a broke or you've been a real turn out for about 13 years or so,
[00:12:03] which is amazing.
[00:12:04] And you're crushing it in Beverly Hills.
[00:12:07] I would love to know, you know, I guess what our audience wants to know is like, how
[00:12:14] did you grow your business?
[00:12:16] Right?
[00:12:16] So you came from a real estate family, but at the end of the day, you still have to build
[00:12:20] your own business.
[00:12:21] You know, how did you go about doing that?
[00:12:23] I'd love to know like what steps you took.
[00:12:26] I mean, because you've been a broker for 13 years, but you're still relatively new as
[00:12:30] an agent, even though you're crushing it.
[00:12:32] So I'd love to know like how you got started.
[00:12:35] So in my early 20s, I did a lot of event promoting in Hollywood.
[00:12:40] And I feel like that was a good starting point to like build my network.
[00:12:51] Sure.
[00:12:51] Just I met thousands of people, you know, just who wanted to go to the event and be
[00:12:58] friend of them.
[00:12:59] And it was just all like, I don't know, just like a natural kind of social thing that
[00:13:04] was like a good baseline.
[00:13:08] So I worked at my real estate company.
[00:13:10] It was like a big commercial and acquisitions company, but I was like part of five people
[00:13:14] who did residential sales.
[00:13:15] So I would get there at like nine in the morning and then work until like six in the like
[00:13:20] standard, you know, corporate job.
[00:13:22] And then I would go home, get ready for the event.
[00:13:25] And I was doing events at like, there's like a famous club called Hyde.
[00:13:29] And I would just like walk over there and work there from like 10 o'clock till two in
[00:13:33] the morning.
[00:13:34] And then I would get up and go back to work, like get up at, you know, six thirty and
[00:13:39] get ready, go to work.
[00:13:40] I had like multiple outfits in the trunk of my card all times, like for my many hats that
[00:13:44] I was wearing.
[00:13:46] And so I feel like that was a good way to like start the hustle of just like networking
[00:13:51] because in real estate or sales in general, like you really just have to go for it and be
[00:13:57] confident and know as many people as possible.
[00:14:01] So I was doing that.
[00:14:03] And then honestly, my first client ever is my husband right now, which sounds kind of
[00:14:11] silly and dumb, but it's the truth.
[00:14:13] Not at all.
[00:14:13] It's because I always say if you're going to make mistakes, do it with family.
[00:14:17] They're the ones that are if you're new, you know, a lot of times people think, oh, I
[00:14:22] don't want to work with my friends or family right now.
[00:14:24] I don't feel very experienced.
[00:14:26] And I always say, who's most likely to forgive you?
[00:14:29] And it's going to be friends and family.
[00:14:31] I mean, you learn a lot with every single deal, like even now, like every single deal,
[00:14:35] like something new comes up and it's just important to like just keep going.
[00:14:40] But like I matched with him on Tinder, you know, it was in my early or mid 20s and my
[00:14:46] best friend was like, you are dating like the worst guys like go on Tinder.
[00:14:50] And I'm like, but aren't the worst guys on Tinder?
[00:14:53] And that's exactly let's go into the lions then where the worst people are.
[00:14:57] And he was like, dude, just try it.
[00:14:59] So my and you found the you found the good guy.
[00:15:02] I found the good guy, like, which is like an understatement.
[00:15:05] So my first and only Tinder date, his pro.
[00:15:09] And only.
[00:15:10] Yeah.
[00:15:12] It's crazy.
[00:15:13] That's a story.
[00:15:14] Or I was just super desperate.
[00:15:16] Like, you know, no, no.
[00:15:18] We're all super desperate.
[00:15:20] No, we knew, like we knew.
[00:15:22] So when we matched his profile picture was him speaking out of wedding.
[00:15:27] Like he was the best man.
[00:15:28] I was like, okay, like this guy is this guy's like looking, you know, for something real.
[00:15:32] And so we went on the date and it was like a three hour day.
[00:15:35] The Valley Parkers had to bring in my keys.
[00:15:37] They're like, you, you guys got to go like the rest of the home.
[00:15:42] 
[00:15:42] And he was like, how many, how many homes have you sold?
[00:15:45] Because I was like, just talking about because he was older.
[00:15:48] He's seven years older.
[00:15:49] So I'm like, yeah, I'm like, I'm just like big time real estate.
[00:15:52] And he's like, how many homes have he sold?
[00:15:54] And I'm like, what worked on like 20, you know, but I haven't sold any by myself.
[00:16:01] Right?
[00:16:02] Sure.
[00:16:03] So months passed and he's like, we're very serious.
[00:16:06] And he's like, I really want to buy my first place.
[00:16:09] And I'm like, okay, cool.
[00:16:10] So we started looking at Sherman Oaks and he was my client.
[00:16:14] And at the first one, like he liked, we walked out front and he put his arm around me.
[00:16:18] And he was like, this would be perfect for us.
[00:16:20] And so at that moment, I was like, oh, okay.
[00:16:23] So we ended up getting it together six months in a dating before getting engaged or anything like that.
[00:16:30] Which everyone says never do that.
[00:16:33] And it worked out for you guys.
[00:16:34] Yes.
[00:16:35] And it just, it just felt right.
[00:16:37] And it was a huge remodel.
[00:16:38] So to make matters worse, we moved in with my parents.
[00:16:42] So he's like 30, 34 year old man, right?
[00:16:45] With my parents.
[00:16:47] Yeah.
[00:16:48] And that was like a great test to see if we could last.
[00:16:52] But that's a, that is a, that is a stress test for sure.
[00:16:56] Yeah.
[00:16:56] And my parents are super great, but we're really close.
[00:16:59] So it's like a lot.
[00:17:01] And so living through that remodel was amazing and cut to we got pregnant, like after we got married and we were living there.
[00:17:12] A month in, we were like, we want to live in Calabasas.
[00:17:16] Like we want to raise our kids in Calabasas.
[00:17:18] It's so safe.
[00:17:19] Calabasas like a great community for families.
[00:17:21] We don't, we want to be closer to my parents because there, let's be honest for baby sitters.
[00:17:26] Sure.
[00:17:27] And on the weekends, we would be traveling.
[00:17:30] We would rent out the house on Airbnb.
[00:17:33] Like we were those weirdos that were like, it's fine.
[00:17:35] Like let's just, let's, let's rent it.
[00:17:37] Let's rent it out.
[00:17:38] We had an owner's closet while we were living there.
[00:17:41] And that turned out to be an amazing lead generator for me.
[00:17:47] Really?
[00:17:47] So yes.
[00:17:48] So once it's such a crazy story.
[00:17:52] So like when we decided we want to move to Calabasas,
[00:17:55] there was nothing for sale.
[00:17:57] And we just walked the neighborhood and we put about like 20 handwritten letters in mailboxes.
[00:18:03] And we're like, hey, I'm pregnant.
[00:18:04] Like let me buy your house.
[00:18:06] And like I think three people called me out of 20 and we ended.
[00:18:11] Yes.
[00:18:12] And we ended up buying the house that we're in now.
[00:18:15] The tenant, there was, it was a rented property and the tenant gave it to the landlord.
[00:18:20] And the landlord called me like two weeks later.
[00:18:22] And he was like, I heard you want to buy my house.
[00:18:24] So I'm like, yes, I do.
[00:18:26] Anyways, we ended up buying it like within, we saw like it for, we saw it for like five minutes.
[00:18:31] All the lights were off.
[00:18:32] It was just, it was a wreck and we were like, we'll take it.
[00:18:35] And we got a great deal and another, it was another remodel.
[00:18:38] But we ended up keeping our first house.
[00:18:40] And so that became a full time rental property.
[00:18:44] So we started doing the Airbnb short term.
[00:18:48] And that was great.
[00:18:50] I would like a random celebrity would rent it.
[00:18:54] And this particular celebrity is someone I actually like went to middle school with, like so random.
[00:19:01] And she was like, by the way, we ended up connecting.
[00:19:04] She's like, by the way, while I'm in town, I want to look for houses.
[00:19:07] Can you show me some?
[00:19:08] So then that's when I started showing her houses.
[00:19:12] And then I got another celebrity in there.
[00:19:15] And she was like, I can't find a property.
[00:19:18] I only want to live in this particular area.
[00:19:20] Like, what can you do?
[00:19:22] So I started going on the Amalas and finding expired canceled with drawn listings, hitting them all up.
[00:19:28] Got a lot of people angry, a lot of people hanging up on me.
[00:19:31] Like what, this is my privacy.
[00:19:33] Like, I'm going to do not call this.
[00:19:35] But then I would get like maybe two guesses.
[00:19:38] Oh, we're still interested in selling.
[00:19:39] It wasn't the right time.
[00:19:40] So I'd give her those leads and she's like, damn, like you're really hard working.
[00:19:44] Like I've never had this before.
[00:19:46] So then the best part about that story is that something hit the market and she sent it to me.
[00:19:53] And she was like, can we get this house?
[00:19:55] And I'm like, sure, let's go see it.
[00:19:57] So she ended up buying that house.
[00:19:58] That was listed.
[00:19:59] She could have gone with her agent she worked with before.
[00:20:02] But because she knew I was like constantly thinking about her, like that, that trust in that like hard working thing,
[00:20:09] she used me on that deal.
[00:20:12] So yeah, it's like at that time you guys were a team almost, right?
[00:20:14] And she actually found the property, but you had done so much work and heavy lifting prior to that that didn't matter who found it.
[00:20:23] She she was with you.
[00:20:24] And and that that is such a wonderful compliment to you.
[00:20:28] It's really important though to build trust more than anything with your client.
[00:20:34] Because there's a lot of people out there that like don't have their clients back like fully.
[00:20:40] And if you show them like they're your client, but you're also their friend, like you literally care about their well being,
[00:20:47] then they're going to stick with you forever.
[00:20:49] And I just think that is the most important thing.
[00:20:52] It's like when you pick a doctor to do an important surgery on you, you go with the one that's like the most trustworthy, you know,
[00:21:01] you don't go with the one who's like going to give you a discount.
[00:21:04] Right.
[00:21:05] You know, it's funny.
[00:21:05] I just started thinking about this in the last couple of years, speaking of of health.
[00:21:10] And I think this relates to real estate because you know, I have a number of doctors like everybody.
[00:21:15] You know, I've got a dermatologist and I've got my general practitioner that does my physical every year.
[00:21:20] And I've got my, you know, I've got the orthopedic person when I have a sports injury or whatever.
[00:21:27] Right.
[00:21:27] So you have these, this, this team of people, a psychiatrist, you know, things like that.
[00:21:31] And and all I really want, I mean, I want them to be competent.
[00:21:36] But more importantly, I want them to care.
[00:21:38] And I, I've had experiences with, with physicians where I felt like they did care and I've had experiences where I felt like they didn't.
[00:21:46] And I will take somebody who cares about me, even over somebody, maybe who's considered a more, a better doctor or maybe has more accolades or more accrued tramants, you know,
[00:21:58] I think, and I think the same applies for real estate.
[00:22:01] Like if, if your clients, like you, like you were saying, you know, your, your friends saw all the hard work you did also had a benchmark because they had worked with an agent prior and said, well, my agent, my previous agent didn't do this.
[00:22:15] That, you know, that is, that is what usually wins the race in my opinion.
[00:22:20] Yes.
[00:22:21] For sure.
[00:22:22] So since then, I was working at like that big corporate office.
[00:22:28] I'll say it a voice club and I started bringing in a bunch of deals and people were like noticing and wondering, what is she doing different?
[00:22:39] And it literally would do marketing, like social media, photo shoots in the office.
[00:22:45] And it gets people talking and honestly DMing you, which gets you clients, like you would never in a million years think like, oh, I'm going to post me showing house that someone will buy house just from that post.
[00:23:00] Like, like there's a new thing that's happening.
[00:23:03] I'm sure it's happening where you live with agents.
[00:23:04] They'll be going to broker's opens on Tuesdays or it's Tuesdays here Tuesdays and Fridays.
[00:23:09] And they will just fully just show it on their story and boom, someone will message them and say, can you show me this?
[00:23:18] And then by the way, can we can we pause for a second?
[00:23:21] Yeah.
[00:23:21] Is that not the greatest idea that anyone who's not busy as a REALTOR should be doing in their local market?
[00:23:28] Go to the like in the past.
[00:23:31] It was a little bit tougher to get brokers or we call them broker opens here in Chicago.
[00:23:36] And by the way, for our audience, if I use the word broker, it's synonymous here in Illinois with REALTOR.
[00:23:41] So I apologize.
[00:23:42] I don't want to confuse anybody.
[00:23:43] I'll try to use the word REALTOR just because I think that will be less confusing.
[00:23:47] But whatever these are called, REALTOR opens, broker opens.
[00:23:50] These are really like 15 years ago when we all didn't have like as much technology.
[00:23:56] It was kind of a headache to go to those things.
[00:23:58] And like if you had a fancy client and they wanted to see something, maybe you'd go check it out or you'd go to support someone else in your office or a friend of yours in the industry.
[00:24:05] But now you can go there and actually use it to your own benefit by posting.
[00:24:11] And by the way, Casey, I'm curious.
[00:24:13] I think people shouldn't even just do this for those broker opens, but they should also do it for every time they go to a showing.
[00:24:21] Like you can find something about any property that's interesting.
[00:24:26] And you could do a quick little 30 second video, right?
[00:24:29] But there's always like this fine line.
[00:24:31] So when I show a house to like my number one client of the moment, they're my number one priority.
[00:24:38] And we find the house.
[00:24:39] I'm not posting it, you know, because then someone might message me and say, can you show me that?
[00:24:44] And then sure.
[00:24:45] And then you're screwed.
[00:24:46] So, yeah.
[00:24:49] So if it's not one that my client's buying, like, yeah, I'm all about posting it.
[00:24:53] It is so important.
[00:24:54] And it's actually like ends up being great for the listing engine as well because you're bringing more eyes to their goal.
[00:25:00] Totally.
[00:25:01] It's a win all the way around.
[00:25:03] And again, for people that are in between clients, this is a great way to drum up some possible activity because if you, you know, and it's also a great place to cut your teeth.
[00:25:15] Doing video because, you know, we now have our phones are very powerful.
[00:25:20] And even if you're not going to have a professional lighting crew, you know, there, which probably you're not for a, you know, a broker open or something.
[00:25:28] You can, you can just shoot a quick, you know, you can shoot and edit and, and make these short form videos.
[00:25:35] And really excite your, your, your base.
[00:25:38] Yeah. So the easiest editing app that I use is called in shot.
[00:25:42] And it's free.
[00:25:43] Totally free.
[00:25:43] Just download it and you click on your phone.
[00:25:45] You can shorten it.
[00:25:46] And I just highly recommend making these reels on Instagram and less than 30 seconds.
[00:25:52] Quick shots.
[00:25:53] But another thing that I think is really interesting about real estate nowadays is the homes that we're showing and we're seeing are just cooler than before.
[00:26:03] So there's a lot of competition, which makes it hard to be a seller.
[00:26:08] But if you have the opportunity to like stylize your home, like you should, because it will stand out in a big way.
[00:26:16] Do you have any suggestions of ways people can do that that aren't, you know, terribly invasive or don't require, you know, tremendous, you know, reconstruction.
[00:26:27] Like even just smart home things are kind of exciting.
[00:26:31] And even though they're not new anymore, you know, being able to control things with voice is kind of a cool feature.
[00:26:37] Yeah.
[00:26:39] One listing I can think about that was on the market before and did it sell.
[00:26:45] And then we took it off the market when our client allowed us to paint the cabinets and fix out switch out light fixtures like literally from I like to go to lows, like lows has like trendier light fixtures.
[00:26:58] Then most other affordable places.
[00:27:02] And so I would switch those out and literally just paint the cabinets.
[00:27:05] And even though someone might walk through and say, I'm going to redo this kitchen in a year or six months or tomorrow, they will get it.
[00:27:13] They will be able to feel what it's going to look like.
[00:27:16] So like it's it's worth every penny and you could do all that like for under, you know, five grand or 10 grand.
[00:27:23] If you put 10 grand in every listing, like it would just go a long way.
[00:27:28] Staging is like the most important thing.
[00:27:31] But then again, you get clients that are like, I can't leave my house or I live here.
[00:27:36] I don't have anywhere to go.
[00:27:37] So you just kind of have to roll with it and figure out the best scenario for your client and the photos go a long way.
[00:27:46] Like even if you don't change anything, if you just get a really high in photographer, which you should cover the cost up for your client, it will.
[00:27:54] It could transform the property without even doing anything.
[00:27:57] Yeah, it's it's I mean, we live in an Instagram world.
[00:28:02] I mean, we've been living in an Instagram world world and remember everyone when we look at photos now we look at images.
[00:28:08] We're probably looking at images on social media images for anything any part of life is now is is really best or most at most commonly viewed or absorbed by consumers by the American public via social media and all of, you know, we expect perfection in these pictures.
[00:28:30] We expect things to look right. We expect them to be filtered correctly for better or for worse. That's where we are.
[00:28:36] And so if you're not putting that sort of thought into your your you know, you're staging your photos, you're really doing your client a huge disservice because it's not about the property.
[00:28:49] It's about how people consume information.
[00:28:51] People want to see now with video oddly enough, I don't think people expect perfection, especially for reals and shorter form video where it's like, hey, this is a great deal.
[00:29:00] This is what I'm doing today. Yeah, you can you can get away with a little bit of imperfection there. But when it comes to staging and and and listing a home and getting the photos.
[00:29:08] Yeah, step it up every you'll make more money for the client.
[00:29:13] Everything everything will work and it'll only cost you a few hundred dollars more like it's not it's not.
[00:29:18] And time is money like time is letting you like it sell it in a week sell it in a week. Everybody wants.
[00:29:24] So as you've been growing, yeah, exactly as you've been growing your business, I you're a hustler and that's that's what I've, you know, sort of garnered from from our conversation so far as you're willing to do a lot of the things that, you know, like that.
[00:29:38] You know, other agents aren't willing to do or maybe that you had to do to sort of stand out in the boys club and sort of get your foot in the door.
[00:29:48] You were writing personal notes and putting them in mailboxes like that.
[00:29:53] 99% of REALTORS are never going to do that and it's a shame because if they did they would likely get results like I mean you had a tenant in a building take a handwritten letter handed off to the landlord, which by the way never happens.
[00:30:09] Super random. Yeah, super random, but it did happen because you put in the effort and you were calling expires for sale by owners.
[00:30:18] You know, people that were off the market and getting screamed at going, I don't want to talk to a REALTOR and yet you're putting in that effort because you never know.
[00:30:28] And that's the job. The job is is a lot of rejection. And and here you are now. And so, so I'm curious to find out what you're doing today.
[00:30:38] So you've grown this incredible business, NDA real estate, you know, you guys work with celebrities, you work with non celebrities, you work in every area of real estate, also investment properties to what's what's your what what are you doing these days for marketing purposes to get more clients.
[00:30:59] Social media number one for sure, you know, as a requirement every agent on NDA has to go to three brokers opens every Tuesday if their schedule allows like if they're free that day they're going and it and it it's working like.
[00:31:13] Like you just you'll you'll just never know who you're going to attract and it's just re advertising that's actually very natural and it works so yeah that for one and then number two we do these fun NDA boxes like we give to clients.
[00:31:31] So it's like it's a branding thing, but then it's super like curated like to go to that influencer. We call it like hashtag gifted by NDA. So like people will see these videos of the NDA boxes, which could they they vary. So they're very curated like I'll get you know a client and I'll be on I will just start making notes of what to get them like which is so like funny because it's like beyond like real estate.
[00:32:00] But it's important for them to know that you know them and you care about them. So like for example, my clients that are in us go right now are buying their dream home and keeping their first home as a rental.
[00:32:14] But we realize at their at their first house that or at both houses you can see each other. So it's like it's just across the canyon. So like just for fun in the box we're going to get them some binoculars like to all that's great.
[00:32:27] Because it's funny. It's like fun right like not really to spy but like that. And then we'll get them like whatever it is a bottle of Patron and recently I got like a client just like designer keychain for their new keys, you know stuff like that.
[00:32:44] And people love it. They just they just eat it right up and then you use the video on your social media and other people will see that and be like wait a minute I want an NDA box like I want a home but I also want the box. So I'm going to hit them up. You know so that's one thing.
[00:32:59] So when curious what's the what are the differences when working with celebrities versus non celebrities as far as helping them buy and sell homes is do celebrities tend to have an output celebrity and high net worth individuals in that in a similar category.
[00:33:18] Because you work with both and do they tend to have more of a team that you then have to sort of work with the entire team or is it I'm curious what the differences are.
[00:33:31] So everyone is totally different. It's just like real life like celebrities some have like business managers that you have to talk to exclusively like you don't even really talk to the client you just show them some houses and you talk to the business manager to make it happen.
[00:33:47] Others you're just dealing directly with them some literally have an entourage but I would say like working with celebrities versus non celebrities.
[00:33:57] Everyone is just so different like there's no no one's in a box. No one's in a box at all.
[00:34:05] So celebrities have been like really great sort with honestly like just super chill and like I on the prize and like big picture in my experience.
[00:34:15] And I feel like I have like an eye for what they want.
[00:34:19] Like recently I sold a house to this amazing girl and it needed literally everything but it was such a cool house that you could you literally you couldn't find it anywhere.
[00:34:31] If it was built in this day like it wouldn't have everything that it had the charm and she was down to do the project and we just like were just so into and on it.
[00:34:41] So that that makes me super super happy when I can find something super special like that and then see a client transform it.
[00:34:49] And so at what point did you decide to sort of build your own brokerage have your own brand and really just make it your own thing as opposed to working under someone else.
[00:35:00] So it all started in 2020 you know COVID was crazy. I was seven months pregnant and for about a month if there was nothing right the whole world was just shut down.
[00:35:13] There was no real estate. No one was there's it like it was March to May. I would say March to May death and I was just like baking all the time just like strawberry bread.
[00:35:24] Whatever I could do with it with my little girls. And so then in May I was like eight months pregnant and then my phone started ringing and people were like hey I'm from Seattle and I want to move to LA.
[00:35:37] COVID is like getting me excited to like be close to my family. Can you can you help us and I'm like can I help you. Yeah I can help you and I'm like have this big tummy and I have my mask on and they at the time you had to work gloves.
[00:35:53] And you had to schedule a showing inside the COVID waivers it was like a huge ordeal.
[00:35:59] So that was going on and so I had one of the biggest months ever and June of 2020 like of my career.
[00:36:07] Wow.
[00:36:07] And I was nine months pregnant even at the hospital I was dealing with two escros which was great because you're just like your mind isn't like focused on what's happening.
[00:36:17] It's just like you're doing it all and so you don't have time to like stress.
[00:36:22] So at that point I was like why do I need to work anywhere other than my own company.
[00:36:33] So that is when I signed up to get my broker's license which is a second kind of step in California.
[00:36:41] Yeah.
[00:36:42] And run my own brokerage. Why can't I do that. I literally do all my own marketing. I have my clients. I never got my clients from my company.
[00:36:50] Sure.
[00:36:50] So I signed up for the test and you had to fly to Sacramento.
[00:36:56] Really?
[00:36:57] Yes. There was no testing in Los Angeles because of COVID.
[00:37:00] Weird.
[00:37:01] All right.
[00:37:01] I was like the headquarters.
[00:37:03] Yeah. So I had my baby and then I don't know maybe like a couple months past and I got my test date and got there and it was just a huge ordeal.
[00:37:14] You have to leave it like four in the morning wake up at three get there at seven.
[00:37:19] You get your you get your thing and it says congratulations and and then that was like the starting point and I was like, okay, let's go.
[00:37:25] So then I don't know a couple weeks went by and I was like NDA. That's it.
[00:37:31] And I looked at my husband. I was like, it's NDA and he was like, yeah, it's NDA.
[00:37:35] Like I had no other ideas. It was just stands for non disclosure agency.
[00:37:42] 
[00:37:42] And I really wanted to just like be different and with my clientele, we really know how to protect our privacy based on my experience with all of these cases before.
[00:37:53] So like for example, when celebrities go to my house, you have to have a trust so that people don't stalk you.
[00:38:01] Like it literally happens and they hang out outside of your house if you don't have a trust.
[00:38:06] And paparazzi as well.
[00:38:08] Yeah. Yeah. All kinds of weirdos watching you.
[00:38:13] And so that's that's not cool. Like your house is supposed to be a place you want to just feel safe and inspired and you don't want to worry about any of those things.
[00:38:21] A lot of these people too. They're just so busy working that when they go home, they just want to chill. They just want to sleep.
[00:38:28] And if you have 20 people standing out front, like you're not sleeping.
[00:38:34] So, so that client I was telling you about earlier that used me after I was finding her off market deals.
[00:38:41] I found out that on her last sale, this that it was leaked and the reason why was because she kept the same trust on her previous house that was leaked by one of the agents and she didn't change the trust.
[00:38:58] So these media people have it saved. Like this is a trust and they have an alert with the title company.
[00:39:05] Anytime this closes under this trust name, that's her house. That's her.
[00:39:10] It's so creepy. So on the next one, I was like, dude, you need to get a new trust and you need to change the name completely.
[00:39:18] Like and even the person who signs for the trust is somebody that they trust, but it's not anyone.
[00:39:25] It's not you. Yeah. It's not anyone with the same last name. So you have your mom or so just someone totally random that you trust.
[00:39:33] Make the trail harder to follow. Yeah. Yeah. So they will do they will sign everything on their behalf.
[00:39:39] And so I just got really good at figuring out how to keep these things private.
[00:39:43] And there's a lot of stress associated with that because a lot of that really goes beyond your control, right?
[00:39:51] Like you, you know, you might not know about trusts. You're not a real estate attorney.
[00:39:56] You're not you're not a estate planning attorney. You're not a business manager. And so you some of these things you probably learn along the way.
[00:40:03] But with but knowing that now is got to be so incredibly valuable to somebody who is who is buying like maybe their first property or or something that hasn't gone through this like, oh, we need to you probably have conversations about privacy and publicity and all of that.
[00:40:19] Yeah, even even like every everyone I recommend getting their house put in a trust.
[00:40:25] It's just important for many. It's it is a great a great idea. Whether it's an investment property or not.
[00:40:32] And you know, talk to an estate planning attorney or someone who knows how to do those things.
[00:40:38] Curious on so you have a team you have many agents on your team. Of course, you're you're looking for for more agents as well. But I'm so our audience where you know we're real to the audiences are REALTORS and I'm curious.
[00:40:52] Yes, you gave a really great suggestion would go to the open houses, take videos post on social.
[00:40:59] Anything else are you still doing personal notes are you still doing the things that you were doing at the very beginning curious what else is working for you.
[00:41:07] I mean coming up with your own personal brand is so important. So like for example, I have one agent on our team and she's such a hustler and she also teaches yoga.
[00:41:18] And I am like run with this. She was like really? Yes, go do a photo shoot at the yoga studio. Like that is your audience.
[00:41:28] Yes, you know, it could be beyond that. But focus on that because that's what she's that's what she's known for in her, you know, community and yeah, the whole like and don't be afraid of the camera.
[00:41:39] Like it's so lame that we have to like be models or whatever and start like taking photos and stuff.
[00:41:48] But it's important because people feel like they know you and they want to know you if you're if you aren't afraid to just be who you are and just be authentic and confident.
[00:41:59] Just it's just so important. So come up with your own personal brand and run with it like social media. If you could just schedule a day every week where you take content like even just with your phone.
[00:42:14] It will get you clients. It really well.
[00:42:18] It's such a great idea and the yoga one is is a really good example because I could I could hear I know a lot of people listening or show have other jobs right there do real estate part time they want to do it full time but they have to pay the bills and right now real estate isn't paying the bills for a lot of people.
[00:42:34] And so as they're building the real estate practice they have these side jobs and maybe someone's you know an Uber driver or maybe they're a yoga instructor or maybe they have a full time career doing something else.
[00:42:47] Regardless, I don't think it's a bad thing to talk about that stuff. I actually think it's quite endearing because if I can see someone who I who I believe is working two jobs like especially like a yoga instructor as well as you know REALTOR.
[00:43:03] I'm like I'm doubly impressed like that doesn't make me think less of them it actually makes me think more of them because I'm like wow they must really be hustling because in order to do two things you got to put in a lot of work and so for anyone listening that's like even if you're an Uber driver I think there's a way to brand that in a way that's like hey I'm doing this right now because I you know there's ways to frame it if you're if that's your your side hustle and there's a lot of people who are doing it.
[00:43:33] There's ways to frame it that isn't necessarily going to make you look like you're not a professional there's always ways to frame things if you're authentic and you're you're proud of what you do you should absolutely be talking about it maybe not every part of your life right you should have privacy too but like this idea of like hey guys I am a hustler anything that demonstrates I work hard and I work for you I think is is and again if it's authentic absolutely people we all want are the people who are doing it.
[00:44:03] We want to be a service professionals in our life to be hustlers we want we want our accountants to be hustlers we want our attorneys we want our financial advisors we want everyone who are doctors we want all these people to be really really skilled and we know that the way to skill is through hard work so anything that demonstrates hard work is usually a win even if it's like hey I'm doing this other job that I don't I really wish I wasn't doing I think there's a way to even brand those things and say like hey this is where I'm at right now and I'm going to do it.
[00:44:33] I think you'll still attract the right people at the right time by exposing being vulnerable being vulnerable and saying this is who I am you know yeah and on that note being a mom I always like was afraid oh my gosh like I'm going to get pregnant people are going to stop calling me like they're going to think I'm like have a headache or whatever and and then once I realized that people
[00:45:03] will say oh can you help me with this they will say it like gently and then you go yes then they're not afraid to use your help but with that being whoever you are in your family life for example a mom run with that as well go to as many mom events as you can with your kid you know use your time for multiple reasons like have fun with your baby like help your baby like have do all these things and you know you can do that.
[00:45:33] It's fun like mommy means but then it's also literally going to help your business in a really natural way so and then also another thing I want to say is have lunch with somebody completely random every one time a week like someone that you met five years ago or you just met them last week like go to that lunch even if you think oh I don't have anything common or I don't really know them just do it.
[00:46:00] The more people that you speak to on a daily basis is the more business you're going to get and the more you're going to learn and it's just good just all around you know in life.
[00:46:13] Yeah I mean I'm thinking back to the beginning of our episode where you were talking about being an event planner and meeting tons of people who are you know at these events and wanting to get into these events and I mean there isn't that's about as great a strategy as I've ever heard to building a new world.
[00:46:30] I mean I don't want to get into a new world but I think I'm going to be able to do that in a real estate database because you're literally just meeting people in a fun social environment you're capturing their information and then you can market to them or take them to lunch or develop a relationship or a friendship with them.
[00:46:44] You know it's really up to you what you want to do but none of that can really happen unless you're out there meeting people and I think there's there's ways that introverts can do this as well so I don't want anyone listening thinking well gosh I you know I being you know going out in
[00:47:00] public is is is taxing for me I'm an introvert believe it or not most people wouldn't probably know that about me I'm an introvert as well so or I'm more introverted the nextroverted I would say I mean I'm both and I'm both but I'm more introverted I need a lot of alone time a lot of rest but I'm really clear that in my life you know getting out and with other people is just is just good for from my my my overall health my my business everything.
[00:47:30] So this idea of just the more things you can social things and it could be online you can be can do it online you can do it in person you know I know I know REALTOR moms speaking of moms who have developed Facebook groups for like here's all the cool mom events that are going on in my area and that becomes it's not even a real estate thing it's a mom sort of resource hub and they get all the other moms to sort of contribute to it and then they get all this business as a result of adding.
[00:48:00] To are screaming val you that is nothing to do with real estate yeah it's because of that trust that building that Trust that's just completely natural and authentic and real.
[00:48:10] Well let's talk about your brokerage because you are growing and you guys are just crushing it and I know there's going to be a lot of our listeners who are.
[00:48:20] So Cal agents and they would are you know this is the year I mean this is the year of recruiting and joining teams and switching firms you
[00:48:29] know, markets changed, rates are different, inventories different, everyone's a little uneasy
[00:48:35] right now. So great opportunity to explore other options. And Casey, I'm curious if you
[00:48:41] were looking for another agent to join your team, you know, what would you be looking for
[00:48:46] just in case any of our audience thinks they might be a match?
[00:48:49] Yeah. So NDA is always looking for a new talent and we're looking for hustlers like
[00:48:54] our favorite word where you just like want to, you just want to keep working and you're
[00:49:00] hardworking. We hired quickly in the beginning to and I learned a lot of things. Like for
[00:49:10] example, I hired someone and I literally like got him listing and he was like, I don't
[00:49:16] have time to do this. Here's a free $10,000 check. No, I'm good.
[00:49:23] And there was a lot more than that. It was more than that. Yeah. Well Casey, I will fly
[00:49:27] out there. I will get my license and you can hand me any deal you want and I will take
[00:49:31] it. Yeah. Yeah. So we're looking for people who like to work and they like people. Yeah,
[00:49:46] that's super important. Yeah. I don't know how to describe it. It's like I can just tell
[00:49:52] when I meet someone that they have it, that just the work ethic and the positive attitude
[00:49:59] is something that is so huge. Like I'm seeing that a lot of people are like super negative
[00:50:07] and I get it. Like it's a crazy time. It's the world is insane. But if you just are like
[00:50:13] glass half full person, things are going to start happening for you and we want to work
[00:50:18] with you or at the very least, if you're a glass half full person, I mean, you recognize
[00:50:23] the the weeds in the garden. You're supposed to see the weeds. Okay. There's weeds in the
[00:50:28] garden and there's also some flowers there too. And if you can sort of see it all and
[00:50:33] see the beauty and some of the challenge at the same time, you know, it's just going
[00:50:39] to be less stressful. Like it's it's still going to be hard. Life is hard. Work is hard.
[00:50:44] Business is hard. But it's all about reducing distress. Right. And so like if you're a glass
[00:50:48] half full person, you know, at least you're paying attention and you're going to get through
[00:50:54] it with a little bit less anxiety and stress. So that's I always think and it's also infectious
[00:51:00] for the office too. When there's positive energy around people kind of feed off of that. So I
[00:51:04] I'm right with you. If anyone out there is thinking about maybe exploring other options,
[00:51:09] you're in the, you know, the LA area, you're an agent, maybe you're not getting what you need
[00:51:14] from your current brokerage or your or your team or, you know, maybe you're on your own and just
[00:51:19] kind of doing it yourself and and really want to team up. What's the best way someone should
[00:51:23] reach out to you in case they think they might be a fit for you? Just call me or email me like
[00:51:28] I'm always available. And my goal is to have an agent representing NDA in every area of Los
[00:51:37] Angeles. So like, you know, we have Joe and Santa Monica. I have Stephen and Silver Lake,
[00:51:43] and Justine and Wilhelm Hills. So I want someone everywhere. And then when I get a lead,
[00:51:49] I tend to be very like giving with my agents. Like I just got a lead in Santa Monica and I showed
[00:51:57] it with Joe. Just because he was there, you know, proximity and he really ran with it and he
[00:52:04] just did such a great job. So if you're in Los Angeles and you want you want you want leads from
[00:52:12] like genuine leads, true leads from a great brokerage and then also like the support.
[00:52:18] That would be that would be NDA. So just hit us up on. Wow. It actual brokerage who hands out
[00:52:24] leads. This is a unicorn. This does not happen. We know this, right? Casey knows this because she
[00:52:30] started at a firm and built it all up on her own without any leads. So she knows just how rare
[00:52:36] and valuable this is. So you have to prove yourself if you want to join her team, meaning show why
[00:52:42] she you need to be part of the NDA team. Reach out to her the best way to do that. Go to her website,
[00:52:49] which is NDA hyphen R E NDA slash R E dot com. I'll have a link to end the show notes.
[00:52:57] There's a contact us form. Also follow Casey on Instagram, Casey Napolitano. We'll have a link
[00:53:02] to that as well in the show notes. But Casey, this it was such a pleasure chatting with you and
[00:53:09] really fun to watch your ascension as you continue to grow the business and do well. So we are
[00:53:16] thrilled to continue. And we didn't even get into your Johnny Knoxville story, which I will have to
[00:53:21] do at a different time because you have some great celebrity stories that aren't under NDA that we
[00:53:26] could talk about. So we will an NDA, a good non disclosure agreement. I think we covered that.
[00:53:32] But the reason she said that is she works a lot of celebrities and she has to sign NDAs all the
[00:53:38] time for her clients to protect their privacy. But she's got some good stories that she can share.
[00:53:43] So we'll have to have you back sometime to hear some fun celebrity stories. But anyway, if anyone,
[00:53:49] and by the way, I'll wrap up with this. If anyone out there is, now again, Casey does work with
[00:53:54] high net worth individuals. So they sometimes have multiple properties and multiple locations. So
[00:54:00] even if you're not an agent in Southern California, but maybe you have, you know, you're in a
[00:54:06] different part of the country where people also have vacation homes, other properties. Casey would
[00:54:11] love the opportunity to work with you and refer business back and forth. So even if you're a New
[00:54:16] York agent or you're down in Miami or wherever you are in the country, Nashville, Austin, all these,
[00:54:21] you know, fun destination places that people are buying, you know, second, third, fourth homes.
[00:54:27] Yeah, referrals happen. So reach out to Casey, let her know how you can provide value to her clients
[00:54:32] and she might be able to return the favor as well. So Casey, really appreciate you being on the show
[00:54:39] today. We want to just as everyone ever wrapping up here just want to remind everyone to please follow

Thank you so much for having me. I am very excited to speak to you because you are the great granddaughter of one of the best. I am sorry because we are going to get to your superstar to very shortly. I want to go all the way back to your great grandfather. In fact, I almost just took some of your thunder away. I have... Well, we will get to this. But Casey has a very impressive family history and something that I was telling her offline. Let's let the audience in on everything. Let's go all the way back to the very beginning because I would love to know you are real estate career. Obviously, you have your own story but you actually go back several generations. I would love to hear about how real estate was part of your family for all these years. Yes. Growing up, I moved five times with my parents because they were always buying homes and fixing them up and selling them. I just were constantly moving in my younger years. I was just like, wow, this is at a young age. It really fascinated me. Then I had my great grandpa, Vern Winchel, who founded Winchel's Donuts. I never really thought anything of it. Honestly, probably until I went to college, did I know how big of a thing that was. I like to bring it up now because people think it's fun. He also did real estate. I feel like he had dozens of homes all over. It was always so cool to me. Real estate in general that you could just be your own boss and find deals. Every kind of deal is just so different. You could just decide what you want to do. Then my parents, when I was around 10, I remember they bought a apartment building that needed everything. It was just a wreck. I watched them redo all the units and still to this day. If they get a vacancy, I'll come in and I'll fix it up so they can get more rent. I've become the design person of the family. Growing up, my dad did probate auctions and also new home sales auctions all over the country. We even went to Portugal at one point. I worked for him from a young age. I think I started working his auctions at maybe 10 or 11 years old. They're called probate auctions. He would get certain amount of properties every couple of months and then the auction would be out front of the house. The house would be sold as is and I really would have a bitter card and there would be no contingencies at all. You're buying all this stuff. That's it. You get what you get and it was so exciting. It was just super fun. Then at one point, he was doing a lot of new home sales. We would go to Seattle and there would be 50 condo units that weren't selling and he would come and do a new marketing program and we would sell 50 units in one day in a hotel bar. It was super fun. It was super cool. It was different. Then my mom, she still works out Rodeo Realty in Calabasis and she does high in homes and then my grandma growing up, her name is Brenda Winchell. She would be driving around with her red nails and her platinum blonde hair and she would be taking notes on her hands. I'll never forget it. She would always have notes on her hands looking for the next property to sell her clients. Also, my Aunt Mimi was a big time agent in Hollywood. I was kind of like, I kind of like had to do it because I knew so much about it that it was like, if I don't do this, I'm going to really like start fresh somewhere else. I went to Pepperdine for writing for journalism and then I was like, I think I turned 18. I got my real estate license, my salesperson license and then should I just go keep going or? No, this is excellent. This is excellent. I was just, no, yes. I mean, all of this is great. I was thinking when you said Pepperdine, I remember Pepperdine is like right on the water, too, isn't it? It's amazing. Yeah. It's so sick. It's amazing. If your child ever wants to go to Pepperdine, they are going to have an incredible, is it Malibu or it's near Malibu? It's Malibu. It's Malibu. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I have some friends that went there and they said, anyway, but aside from that, so it's either donuts or real estate. You had to go into one of those, one of those two industries and... Exactly. Yeah. Yeah. And by the way, if anyone, there are still a few winchels stores or shops, where are they? For anyone out there, because if you haven't had a winchels donut, I have had one. They are incredible. They are literally the best donuts you'll ever have. Where can they find them in SoCal? So in Los Angeles, there's one in Tarzana, off a recida right off the freeway, and then there's one on Melrose in Hollywood. Oh, I think there might be one on Vine Still, but back in the day, there were every exit. Every exit off the one on one, there was a winchels donuts. And still to this day, if you see a donut shop and the sign is shaped like a triangle, you know it was a winchels at some point. So back in the 80s, when he sold the whole company, he was like, oh, I'm sorry. I'm not saying anything to yummy omdonuts, you would start seeing that they would just keep the sign, but then just a new name was on it. Well, that was that that's a very big brand. And so you know, I would I, but I know a lot of our audience might be thinking is she grew up in a real estate family. This is all going, this is all must be so easy for her because she's just been involved with it for her entire life. And it goes back generations. You have grandparents and great grandparents. And in fact, I do want to make a point, your great grandfather who did start winchels donuts had said, yes, that's my business, but real estate is really the best investment. And he really, he really hammered that into the family, right? So the idea was the donuts were what paid the bills, but then also wanting to build sort of multi generational wealth through through these real estate investments. And it obviously spread to like every member of your family. Exactly. 100% for sure. So you and you've been a broke or you've been a real turn out for about 13 years or so, which is amazing. And you're crushing it in Beverly Hills. I would love to know, you know, I guess what our audience wants to know is like, how did you grow your business? Right? So you came from a real estate family, but at the end of the day, you still have to build your own business. You know, how did you go about doing that? I'd love to know like what steps you took. I mean, because you've been a broker for 13 years, but you're still relatively new as an agent, even though you're crushing it. So I'd love to know like how you got started. So in my early 20s, I did a lot of event promoting in Hollywood. And I feel like that was a good starting point to like build my network. Sure. Just I met thousands of people, you know, just who wanted to go to the event and be friend of them. And it was just all like, I don't know, just like a natural kind of social thing that was like a good baseline. So I worked at my real estate company. It was like a big commercial and acquisitions company, but I was like part of five people who did residential sales. So I would get there at like nine in the morning and then work until like six in the like standard, you know, corporate job. And then I would go home, get ready for the event. And I was doing events at like, there's like a famous club called Hyde. And I would just like walk over there and work there from like 10 o'clock till two in the morning. And then I would get up and go back to work, like get up at, you know, six thirty and get ready, go to work. I had like multiple outfits in the trunk of my card all times, like for my many hats that I was wearing. And so I feel like that was a good way to like start the hustle of just like networking because in real estate or sales in general, like you really just have to go for it and be confident and know as many people as possible. So I was doing that. And then honestly, my first client ever is my husband right now, which sounds kind of silly and dumb, but it's the truth. Not at all. It's because I always say if you're going to make mistakes, do it with family. They're the ones that are if you're new, you know, a lot of times people think, oh, I don't want to work with my friends or family right now. I don't feel very experienced. And I always say, who's most likely to forgive you? And it's going to be friends and family. I mean, you learn a lot with every single deal, like even now, like every single deal, like something new comes up and it's just important to like just keep going. But like I matched with him on Tinder, you know, it was in my early or mid 20s and my best friend was like, you are dating like the worst guys like go on Tinder. And I'm like, but aren't the worst guys on Tinder? And that's exactly let's go into the lions then where the worst people are. And he was like, dude, just try it. So my and you found the you found the good guy. I found the good guy, like, which is like an understatement. So my first and only Tinder date, his pro. And only. Yeah. It's crazy. That's a story. Or I was just super desperate. Like, you know, no, no. We're all super desperate. No, we knew, like we knew. So when we matched his profile picture was him speaking out of wedding. Like he was the best man. I was like, okay, like this guy is this guy's like looking, you know, for something real. And so we went on the date and it was like a three hour day. The Valley Parkers had to bring in my keys. They're like, you, you guys got to go like the rest of the home. And he was like, how many, how many homes have you sold? Because I was like, just talking about because he was older. He's seven years older. So I'm like, yeah, I'm like, I'm just like big time real estate. And he's like, how many homes have he sold? And I'm like, what worked on like 20, you know, but I haven't sold any by myself. Right? Sure. So months passed and he's like, we're very serious. And he's like, I really want to buy my first place. And I'm like, okay, cool. So we started looking at Sherman Oaks and he was my client. And at the first one, like he liked, we walked out front and he put his arm around me. And he was like, this would be perfect for us. And so at that moment, I was like, oh, okay. So we ended up getting it together six months in a dating before getting engaged or anything like that. Which everyone says never do that. And it worked out for you guys. Yes. And it just, it just felt right. And it was a huge remodel. So to make matters worse, we moved in with my parents. So he's like 30, 34 year old man, right? With my parents. Yeah. And that was like a great test to see if we could last. But that's a, that is a, that is a stress test for sure. Yeah. And my parents are super great, but we're really close. So it's like a lot. And so living through that remodel was amazing and cut to we got pregnant, like after we got married and we were living there. A month in, we were like, we want to live in Calabasas. Like we want to raise our kids in Calabasas. It's so safe. Calabasas like a great community for families. We don't, we want to be closer to my parents because there, let's be honest for baby sitters. Sure. And on the weekends, we would be traveling. We would rent out the house on Airbnb. Like we were those weirdos that were like, it's fine. Like let's just, let's, let's rent it. Let's rent it out. We had an owner's closet while we were living there. And that turned out to be an amazing lead generator for me. Really? So yes. So once it's such a crazy story. So like when we decided we want to move to Calabasas, there was nothing for sale. And we just walked the neighborhood and we put about like 20 handwritten letters in mailboxes. And we're like, hey, I'm pregnant. Like let me buy your house. And like I think three people called me out of 20 and we ended. Yes. And we ended up buying the house that we're in now. The tenant, there was, it was a rented property and the tenant gave it to the landlord. And the landlord called me like two weeks later. And he was like, I heard you want to buy my house. So I'm like, yes, I do. Anyways, we ended up buying it like within, we saw like it for, we saw it for like five minutes. All the lights were off. It was just, it was a wreck and we were like, we'll take it. And we got a great deal and another, it was another remodel. But we ended up keeping our first house. And so that became a full time rental property. So we started doing the Airbnb short term. And that was great. I would like a random celebrity would rent it. And this particular celebrity is someone I actually like went to middle school with, like so random. And she was like, by the way, we ended up connecting. She's like, by the way, while I'm in town, I want to look for houses. Can you show me some? So then that's when I started showing her houses. And then I got another celebrity in there. And she was like, I can't find a property. I only want to live in this particular area. Like, what can you do? So I started going on the Amalas and finding expired canceled with drawn listings, hitting them all up. Got a lot of people angry, a lot of people hanging up on me. Like what, this is my privacy. Like, I'm going to do not call this. But then I would get like maybe two guesses. Oh, we're still interested in selling. It wasn't the right time. So I'd give her those leads and she's like, damn, like you're really hard working. Like I've never had this before. So then the best part about that story is that something hit the market and she sent it to me. And she was like, can we get this house? And I'm like, sure, let's go see it. So she ended up buying that house. That was listed. She could have gone with her agent she worked with before. But because she knew I was like constantly thinking about her, like that, that trust in that like hard working thing, she used me on that deal. So yeah, it's like at that time you guys were a team almost, right? And she actually found the property, but you had done so much work and heavy lifting prior to that that didn't matter who found it. She she was with you. And and that that is such a wonderful compliment to you. It's really important though to build trust more than anything with your client. Because there's a lot of people out there that like don't have their clients back like fully. And if you show them like they're your client, but you're also their friend, like you literally care about their well being, then they're going to stick with you forever. And I just think that is the most important thing. It's like when you pick a doctor to do an important surgery on you, you go with the one that's like the most trustworthy, you know, you don't go with the one who's like going to give you a discount. Right. You know, it's funny. I just started thinking about this in the last couple of years, speaking of of health. And I think this relates to real estate because you know, I have a number of doctors like everybody. You know, I've got a dermatologist and I've got my general practitioner that does my physical every year. And I've got my, you know, I've got the orthopedic person when I have a sports injury or whatever. Right. So you have these, this, this team of people, a psychiatrist, you know, things like that. And and all I really want, I mean, I want them to be competent. But more importantly, I want them to care. And I, I've had experiences with, with physicians where I felt like they did care and I've had experiences where I felt like they didn't. And I will take somebody who cares about me, even over somebody, maybe who's considered a more, a better doctor or maybe has more accolades or more accrued tramants, you know, I think, and I think the same applies for real estate. Like if, if your clients, like you, like you were saying, you know, your, your friends saw all the hard work you did also had a benchmark because they had worked with an agent prior and said, well, my agent, my previous agent didn't do this. That, you know, that is, that is what usually wins the race in my opinion. Yes. For sure. So since then, I was working at like that big corporate office. I'll say it a voice club and I started bringing in a bunch of deals and people were like noticing and wondering, what is she doing different? And it literally would do marketing, like social media, photo shoots in the office. And it gets people talking and honestly DMing you, which gets you clients, like you would never in a million years think like, oh, I'm going to post me showing house that someone will buy house just from that post. Like, like there's a new thing that's happening. I'm sure it's happening where you live with agents. They'll be going to broker's opens on Tuesdays or it's Tuesdays here Tuesdays and Fridays. And they will just fully just show it on their story and boom, someone will message them and say, can you show me this? And then by the way, can we can we pause for a second? Yeah. Is that not the greatest idea that anyone who's not busy as a REALTOR should be doing in their local market? Go to the like in the past. It was a little bit tougher to get brokers or we call them broker opens here in Chicago. And by the way, for our audience, if I use the word broker, it's synonymous here in Illinois with REALTOR. So I apologize. I don't want to confuse anybody. I'll try to use the word REALTOR just because I think that will be less confusing. But whatever these are called, REALTOR opens, broker opens. These are really like 15 years ago when we all didn't have like as much technology. It was kind of a headache to go to those things. And like if you had a fancy client and they wanted to see something, maybe you'd go check it out or you'd go to support someone else in your office or a friend of yours in the industry. But now you can go there and actually use it to your own benefit by posting. And by the way, Casey, I'm curious. I think people shouldn't even just do this for those broker opens, but they should also do it for every time they go to a showing. Like you can find something about any property that's interesting. And you could do a quick little 30 second video, right? But there's always like this fine line. So when I show a house to like my number one client of the moment, they're my number one priority. And we find the house. I'm not posting it, you know, because then someone might message me and say, can you show me that? And then sure. And then you're screwed. So, yeah. So if it's not one that my client's buying, like, yeah, I'm all about posting it. It is so important. And it's actually like ends up being great for the listing engine as well because you're bringing more eyes to their goal. Totally. It's a win all the way around. And again, for people that are in between clients, this is a great way to drum up some possible activity because if you, you know, and it's also a great place to cut your teeth. Doing video because, you know, we now have our phones are very powerful. And even if you're not going to have a professional lighting crew, you know, there, which probably you're not for a, you know, a broker open or something. You can, you can just shoot a quick, you know, you can shoot and edit and, and make these short form videos. And really excite your, your, your base. Yeah. So the easiest editing app that I use is called in shot. And it's free. Totally free. Just download it and you click on your phone. You can shorten it. And I just highly recommend making these reels on Instagram and less than 30 seconds. Quick shots. But another thing that I think is really interesting about real estate nowadays is the homes that we're showing and we're seeing are just cooler than before. So there's a lot of competition, which makes it hard to be a seller. But if you have the opportunity to like stylize your home, like you should, because it will stand out in a big way. Do you have any suggestions of ways people can do that that aren't, you know, terribly invasive or don't require, you know, tremendous, you know, reconstruction. Like even just smart home things are kind of exciting. And even though they're not new anymore, you know, being able to control things with voice is kind of a cool feature. Yeah. One listing I can think about that was on the market before and did it sell. And then we took it off the market when our client allowed us to paint the cabinets and fix out switch out light fixtures like literally from I like to go to lows, like lows has like trendier light fixtures. Then most other affordable places. And so I would switch those out and literally just paint the cabinets. And even though someone might walk through and say, I'm going to redo this kitchen in a year or six months or tomorrow, they will get it. They will be able to feel what it's going to look like. So like it's it's worth every penny and you could do all that like for under, you know, five grand or 10 grand. If you put 10 grand in every listing, like it would just go a long way. Staging is like the most important thing. But then again, you get clients that are like, I can't leave my house or I live here. I don't have anywhere to go. So you just kind of have to roll with it and figure out the best scenario for your client and the photos go a long way. Like even if you don't change anything, if you just get a really high in photographer, which you should cover the cost up for your client, it will. It could transform the property without even doing anything. Yeah, it's it's I mean, we live in an Instagram world. I mean, we've been living in an Instagram world world and remember everyone when we look at photos now we look at images. We're probably looking at images on social media images for anything any part of life is now is is really best or most at most commonly viewed or absorbed by consumers by the American public via social media and all of, you know, we expect perfection in these pictures. We expect things to look right. We expect them to be filtered correctly for better or for worse. That's where we are. And so if you're not putting that sort of thought into your your you know, you're staging your photos, you're really doing your client a huge disservice because it's not about the property. It's about how people consume information. People want to see now with video oddly enough, I don't think people expect perfection, especially for reals and shorter form video where it's like, hey, this is a great deal. This is what I'm doing today. Yeah, you can you can get away with a little bit of imperfection there. But when it comes to staging and and and listing a home and getting the photos. Yeah, step it up every you'll make more money for the client. Everything everything will work and it'll only cost you a few hundred dollars more like it's not it's not. And time is money like time is letting you like it sell it in a week sell it in a week. Everybody wants. So as you've been growing, yeah, exactly as you've been growing your business, I you're a hustler and that's that's what I've, you know, sort of garnered from from our conversation so far as you're willing to do a lot of the things that, you know, like that. You know, other agents aren't willing to do or maybe that you had to do to sort of stand out in the boys club and sort of get your foot in the door. You were writing personal notes and putting them in mailboxes like that. 99% of REALTORS are never going to do that and it's a shame because if they did they would likely get results like I mean you had a tenant in a building take a handwritten letter handed off to the landlord, which by the way never happens. Super random. Yeah, super random, but it did happen because you put in the effort and you were calling expires for sale by owners. You know, people that were off the market and getting screamed at going, I don't want to talk to a REALTOR and yet you're putting in that effort because you never know. And that's the job. The job is is a lot of rejection. And and here you are now. And so, so I'm curious to find out what you're doing today. So you've grown this incredible business, NDA real estate, you know, you guys work with celebrities, you work with non celebrities, you work in every area of real estate, also investment properties to what's what's your what what are you doing these days for marketing purposes to get more clients. Social media number one for sure, you know, as a requirement every agent on NDA has to go to three brokers opens every Tuesday if their schedule allows like if they're free that day they're going and it and it it's working like. Like you just you'll you'll just never know who you're going to attract and it's just re advertising that's actually very natural and it works so yeah that for one and then number two we do these fun NDA boxes like we give to clients. So it's like it's a branding thing, but then it's super like curated like to go to that influencer. We call it like hashtag gifted by NDA. So like people will see these videos of the NDA boxes, which could they they vary. So they're very curated like I'll get you know a client and I'll be on I will just start making notes of what to get them like which is so like funny because it's like beyond like real estate. But it's important for them to know that you know them and you care about them. So like for example, my clients that are in us go right now are buying their dream home and keeping their first home as a rental. But we realize at their at their first house that or at both houses you can see each other. So it's like it's just across the canyon. So like just for fun in the box we're going to get them some binoculars like to all that's great. Because it's funny. It's like fun right like not really to spy but like that. And then we'll get them like whatever it is a bottle of Patron and recently I got like a client just like designer keychain for their new keys, you know stuff like that. And people love it. They just they just eat it right up and then you use the video on your social media and other people will see that and be like wait a minute I want an NDA box like I want a home but I also want the box. So I'm going to hit them up. You know so that's one thing. So when curious what's the what are the differences when working with celebrities versus non celebrities as far as helping them buy and sell homes is do celebrities tend to have an output celebrity and high net worth individuals in that in a similar category. Because you work with both and do they tend to have more of a team that you then have to sort of work with the entire team or is it I'm curious what the differences are. So everyone is totally different. It's just like real life like celebrities some have like business managers that you have to talk to exclusively like you don't even really talk to the client you just show them some houses and you talk to the business manager to make it happen. Others you're just dealing directly with them some literally have an entourage but I would say like working with celebrities versus non celebrities. Everyone is just so different like there's no no one's in a box. No one's in a box at all. So celebrities have been like really great sort with honestly like just super chill and like I on the prize and like big picture in my experience. And I feel like I have like an eye for what they want. Like recently I sold a house to this amazing girl and it needed literally everything but it was such a cool house that you could you literally you couldn't find it anywhere. If it was built in this day like it wouldn't have everything that it had the charm and she was down to do the project and we just like were just so into and on it. So that that makes me super super happy when I can find something super special like that and then see a client transform it. And so at what point did you decide to sort of build your own brokerage have your own brand and really just make it your own thing as opposed to working under someone else. So it all started in 2020 you know COVID was crazy. I was seven months pregnant and for about a month if there was nothing right the whole world was just shut down. There was no real estate. No one was there's it like it was March to May. I would say March to May death and I was just like baking all the time just like strawberry bread. Whatever I could do with it with my little girls. And so then in May I was like eight months pregnant and then my phone started ringing and people were like hey I'm from Seattle and I want to move to LA. COVID is like getting me excited to like be close to my family. Can you can you help us and I'm like can I help you. Yeah I can help you and I'm like have this big tummy and I have my mask on and they at the time you had to work gloves. And you had to schedule a showing inside the COVID waivers it was like a huge ordeal. So that was going on and so I had one of the biggest months ever and June of 2020 like of my career. Wow. And I was nine months pregnant even at the hospital I was dealing with two escros which was great because you're just like your mind isn't like focused on what's happening. It's just like you're doing it all and so you don't have time to like stress. So at that point I was like why do I need to work anywhere other than my own company. So that is when I signed up to get my broker's license which is a second kind of step in California. Yeah. And run my own brokerage. Why can't I do that. I literally do all my own marketing. I have my clients. I never got my clients from my company. Sure. So I signed up for the test and you had to fly to Sacramento. Really? Yes. There was no testing in Los Angeles because of COVID. Weird. All right. I was like the headquarters. Yeah. So I had my baby and then I don't know maybe like a couple months past and I got my test date and got there and it was just a huge ordeal. You have to leave it like four in the morning wake up at three get there at seven. You get your you get your thing and it says congratulations and and then that was like the starting point and I was like, okay, let's go. So then I don't know a couple weeks went by and I was like NDA. That's it. And I looked at my husband. I was like, it's NDA and he was like, yeah, it's NDA. Like I had no other ideas. It was just stands for non disclosure agency. And I really wanted to just like be different and with my clientele, we really know how to protect our privacy based on my experience with all of these cases before. So like for example, when celebrities go to my house, you have to have a trust so that people don't stalk you. Like it literally happens and they hang out outside of your house if you don't have a trust. And paparazzi as well. Yeah. Yeah. All kinds of weirdos watching you. And so that's that's not cool. Like your house is supposed to be a place you want to just feel safe and inspired and you don't want to worry about any of those things. A lot of these people too. They're just so busy working that when they go home, they just want to chill. They just want to sleep. And if you have 20 people standing out front, like you're not sleeping. So, so that client I was telling you about earlier that used me after I was finding her off market deals. I found out that on her last sale, this that it was leaked and the reason why was because she kept the same trust on her previous house that was leaked by one of the agents and she didn't change the trust. So these media people have it saved. Like this is a trust and they have an alert with the title company. Anytime this closes under this trust name, that's her house. That's her. It's so creepy. So on the next one, I was like, dude, you need to get a new trust and you need to change the name completely. Like and even the person who signs for the trust is somebody that they trust, but it's not anyone. It's not you. Yeah. It's not anyone with the same last name. So you have your mom or so just someone totally random that you trust. Make the trail harder to follow. Yeah. Yeah. So they will do they will sign everything on their behalf. And so I just got really good at figuring out how to keep these things private. And there's a lot of stress associated with that because a lot of that really goes beyond your control, right? Like you, you know, you might not know about trusts. You're not a real estate attorney. You're not you're not a estate planning attorney. You're not a business manager. And so you some of these things you probably learn along the way. But with but knowing that now is got to be so incredibly valuable to somebody who is who is buying like maybe their first property or or something that hasn't gone through this like, oh, we need to you probably have conversations about privacy and publicity and all of that. Yeah, even even like every everyone I recommend getting their house put in a trust. It's just important for many. It's it is a great a great idea. Whether it's an investment property or not. And you know, talk to an estate planning attorney or someone who knows how to do those things. Curious on so you have a team you have many agents on your team. Of course, you're you're looking for for more agents as well. But I'm so our audience where you know we're real to the audiences are REALTORS and I'm curious. Yes, you gave a really great suggestion would go to the open houses, take videos post on social. Anything else are you still doing personal notes are you still doing the things that you were doing at the very beginning curious what else is working for you. I mean coming up with your own personal brand is so important. So like for example, I have one agent on our team and she's such a hustler and she also teaches yoga. And I am like run with this. She was like really? Yes, go do a photo shoot at the yoga studio. Like that is your audience. Yes, you know, it could be beyond that. But focus on that because that's what she's that's what she's known for in her, you know, community and yeah, the whole like and don't be afraid of the camera. Like it's so lame that we have to like be models or whatever and start like taking photos and stuff. But it's important because people feel like they know you and they want to know you if you're if you aren't afraid to just be who you are and just be authentic and confident. Just it's just so important. So come up with your own personal brand and run with it like social media. If you could just schedule a day every week where you take content like even just with your phone. It will get you clients. It really well. It's such a great idea and the yoga one is is a really good example because I could I could hear I know a lot of people listening or show have other jobs right there do real estate part time they want to do it full time but they have to pay the bills and right now real estate isn't paying the bills for a lot of people. And so as they're building the real estate practice they have these side jobs and maybe someone's you know an Uber driver or maybe they're a yoga instructor or maybe they have a full time career doing something else. Regardless, I don't think it's a bad thing to talk about that stuff. I actually think it's quite endearing because if I can see someone who I who I believe is working two jobs like especially like a yoga instructor as well as you know REALTOR. I'm like I'm doubly impressed like that doesn't make me think less of them it actually makes me think more of them because I'm like wow they must really be hustling because in order to do two things you got to put in a lot of work and so for anyone listening that's like even if you're an Uber driver I think there's a way to brand that in a way that's like hey I'm doing this right now because I you know there's ways to frame it if you're if that's your your side hustle and there's a lot of people who are doing it. There's ways to frame it that isn't necessarily going to make you look like you're not a professional there's always ways to frame things if you're authentic and you're you're proud of what you do you should absolutely be talking about it maybe not every part of your life right you should have privacy too but like this idea of like hey guys I am a hustler anything that demonstrates I work hard and I work for you I think is is and again if it's authentic absolutely people we all want are the people who are doing it. We want to be a service professionals in our life to be hustlers we want we want our accountants to be hustlers we want our attorneys we want our financial advisors we want everyone who are doctors we want all these people to be really really skilled and we know that the way to skill is through hard work so anything that demonstrates hard work is usually a win even if it's like hey I'm doing this other job that I don't I really wish I wasn't doing I think there's a way to even brand those things and say like hey this is where I'm at right now and I'm going to do it. I think you'll still attract the right people at the right time by exposing being vulnerable being vulnerable and saying this is who I am you know yeah and on that note being a mom I always like was afraid oh my gosh like I'm going to get pregnant people are going to stop calling me like they're going to think I'm like have a headache or whatever and and then once I realized that people will say oh can you help me with this they will say it like gently and then you go yes then they're not afraid to use your help but with that being whoever you are in your family life for example a mom run with that as well go to as many mom events as you can with your kid you know use your time for multiple reasons like have fun with your baby like help your baby like have do all these things and you know you can do that. It's fun like mommy means but then it's also literally going to help your business in a really natural way so and then also another thing I want to say is have lunch with somebody completely random every one time a week like someone that you met five years ago or you just met them last week like go to that lunch even if you think oh I don't have anything common or I don't really know them just do it. The more people that you speak to on a daily basis is the more business you're going to get and the more you're going to learn and it's just good just all around you know in life. Yeah I mean I'm thinking back to the beginning of our episode where you were talking about being an event planner and meeting tons of people who are you know at these events and wanting to get into these events and I mean there isn't that's about as great a strategy as I've ever heard to building a new world. I mean I don't want to get into a new world but I think I'm going to be able to do that in a real estate database because you're literally just meeting people in a fun social environment you're capturing their information and then you can market to them or take them to lunch or develop a relationship or a friendship with them. You know it's really up to you what you want to do but none of that can really happen unless you're out there meeting people and I think there's there's ways that introverts can do this as well so I don't want anyone listening thinking well gosh I you know I being you know going out in public is is is taxing for me I'm an introvert believe it or not most people wouldn't probably know that about me I'm an introvert as well so or I'm more introverted the nextroverted I would say I mean I'm both and I'm both but I'm more introverted I need a lot of alone time a lot of rest but I'm really clear that in my life you know getting out and with other people is just is just good for from my my my overall health my my business everything. So this idea of just the more things you can social things and it could be online you can be can do it online you can do it in person you know I know I know REALTOR moms speaking of moms who have developed Facebook groups for like here's all the cool mom events that are going on in my area and that becomes it's not even a real estate thing it's a mom sort of resource hub and they get all the other moms to sort of contribute to it and then they get all this business as a result of adding. To are screaming val you that is nothing to do with real estate yeah it's because of that trust that building that Trust that's just completely natural and authentic and real. Well let's talk about your brokerage because you are growing and you guys are just crushing it and I know there's going to be a lot of our listeners who are. So Cal agents and they would are you know this is the year I mean this is the year of recruiting and joining teams and switching firms you know, markets changed, rates are different, inventories different, everyone's a little uneasy right now. So great opportunity to explore other options. And Casey, I'm curious if you were looking for another agent to join your team, you know, what would you be looking for just in case any of our audience thinks they might be a match? Yeah. So NDA is always looking for a new talent and we're looking for hustlers like our favorite word where you just like want to, you just want to keep working and you're hardworking. We hired quickly in the beginning to and I learned a lot of things. Like for example, I hired someone and I literally like got him listing and he was like, I don't have time to do this. Here's a free $10,000 check. No, I'm good. And there was a lot more than that. It was more than that. Yeah. Well Casey, I will fly out there. I will get my license and you can hand me any deal you want and I will take it. Yeah. Yeah. So we're looking for people who like to work and they like people. Yeah, that's super important. Yeah. I don't know how to describe it. It's like I can just tell when I meet someone that they have it, that just the work ethic and the positive attitude is something that is so huge. Like I'm seeing that a lot of people are like super negative and I get it. Like it's a crazy time. It's the world is insane. But if you just are like glass half full person, things are going to start happening for you and we want to work with you or at the very least, if you're a glass half full person, I mean, you recognize the the weeds in the garden. You're supposed to see the weeds. Okay. There's weeds in the garden and there's also some flowers there too. And if you can sort of see it all and see the beauty and some of the challenge at the same time, you know, it's just going to be less stressful. Like it's it's still going to be hard. Life is hard. Work is hard. Business is hard. But it's all about reducing distress. Right. And so like if you're a glass half full person, you know, at least you're paying attention and you're going to get through it with a little bit less anxiety and stress. So that's I always think and it's also infectious for the office too. When there's positive energy around people kind of feed off of that. So I I'm right with you. If anyone out there is thinking about maybe exploring other options, you're in the, you know, the LA area, you're an agent, maybe you're not getting what you need from your current brokerage or your or your team or, you know, maybe you're on your own and just kind of doing it yourself and and really want to team up. What's the best way someone should reach out to you in case they think they might be a fit for you? Just call me or email me like I'm always available. And my goal is to have an agent representing NDA in every area of Los Angeles. So like, you know, we have Joe and Santa Monica. I have Stephen and Silver Lake, and Justine and Wilhelm Hills. So I want someone everywhere. And then when I get a lead, I tend to be very like giving with my agents. Like I just got a lead in Santa Monica and I showed it with Joe. Just because he was there, you know, proximity and he really ran with it and he just did such a great job. So if you're in Los Angeles and you want you want you want leads from like genuine leads, true leads from a great brokerage and then also like the support. That would be that would be NDA. So just hit us up on. Wow. It actual brokerage who hands out leads. This is a unicorn. This does not happen. We know this, right? Casey knows this because she started at a firm and built it all up on her own without any leads. So she knows just how rare and valuable this is. So you have to prove yourself if you want to join her team, meaning show why she you need to be part of the NDA team. Reach out to her the best way to do that. Go to her website, which is NDA hyphen R E NDA slash R E dot com. I'll have a link to end the show notes. There's a contact us form. Also follow Casey on Instagram, Casey Napolitano. We'll have a link to that as well in the show notes. But Casey, this it was such a pleasure chatting with you and really fun to watch your ascension as you continue to grow the business and do well. So we are thrilled to continue. And we didn't even get into your Johnny Knoxville story, which I will have to do at a different time because you have some great celebrity stories that aren't under NDA that we could talk about. So we will an NDA, a good non disclosure agreement. I think we covered that. But the reason she said that is she works a lot of celebrities and she has to sign NDAs all the time for her clients to protect their privacy. But she's got some good stories that she can share. So we'll have to have you back sometime to hear some fun celebrity stories. But anyway, if anyone, and by the way, I'll wrap up with this. If anyone out there is, now again, Casey does work with high net worth individuals. So they sometimes have multiple properties and multiple locations. So even if you're not an agent in Southern California, but maybe you have, you know, you're in a different part of the country where people also have vacation homes, other properties. Casey would love the opportunity to work with you and refer business back and forth. So even if you're a New York agent or you're down in Miami or wherever you are in the country, Nashville, Austin, all these, you know, fun destination places that people are buying, you know, second, third, fourth homes. Yeah, referrals happen. So reach out to Casey, let her know how you can provide value to her clients and she might be able to return the favor as well. So Casey, really appreciate you being on the show today. We want to just as everyone ever wrapping up here just want to remind everyone to please follow Casey on Instagram, Casey, Napolitano, Instagram.
