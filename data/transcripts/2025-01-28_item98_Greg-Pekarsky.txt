[00:01:19] Today's episode is brought to you by corded.io.
[00:01:22] Are you looking for agents to join your brokerage, your team?
[00:01:26] Now as a real estate recruiter, I can tell you the answer is always yes.
[00:01:30] But most agents aren't looking to move right now.
[00:01:33] So how do you know who to contact?
[00:01:35] Well, what if I were to tell you there's a recruiting and retention tool powered by
[00:01:39] artificial intelligence that shows you exactly which agents in your local market are looking
[00:01:44] to leave their brokerage right now and which agents at your own firm are also looking
[00:01:50] to leave you?
[00:01:51] Now, I've been recruiting Realters for 15 years and I've hired over 2,000 agents.
[00:01:56] I can tell you with no exaggeration, this is the tool I've been waiting for.
[00:02:00] Corded's AI looks for trends across dozens of variables for each agent in your market
[00:02:05] and shows you which agents they believe are likely to move.
[00:02:08] Not only does it do that, but Corded's AI went and visited my recruiting website and
[00:02:13] read everything I offer.
[00:02:15] So now when I'm recruiting, Corded's AI tells me exactly what to say based on that
[00:02:20] agent's needs and what my brokerage can offer.
[00:02:23] It even writes emails for me.
[00:02:25] I've never seen anything like it and I use it every single day.
[00:02:29] Now if you are looking to grow your brokerage, Corded.io is the best tool out there.
[00:02:34] Visit Corded.io to schedule a demo again.
[00:02:37] That's Corded.io.
[00:02:39] And now onto the show.
[00:02:55] Hello and welcome to Keeping It Real, the largest podcast made by Real Estate agents
[00:03:00] and four Real Estate agents.
[00:03:02] My name is DJ Paris.
[00:03:03] I am your guide and host through the show.
[00:03:05] And we have a whole new thing we're doing today.
[00:03:08] So I want to talk about it.
[00:03:09] So bear with me for just a minute while I explain what you're about to listen to.
[00:03:13] Because it's really exciting and it's the first time we've done it and we can't wait
[00:03:18] to share it with all of you.
[00:03:20] So I've always had this sort of challenge which was we have so many listeners.
[00:03:24] We have about 20 to 30,000 agents that listen to every single episode we do.
[00:03:29] We're so grateful for that and grateful to all of you who are listening now.
[00:03:33] And the challenge though is it's usually like a one-way communication, right?
[00:03:36] I talk to the guests.
[00:03:38] You're not able to interact with the guests very effectively other than sending them emails
[00:03:42] afterwards or hitting them up on social media.
[00:03:45] So I thought, well, how could we sort of engage the audience in real time with the guests
[00:03:49] and we thought about doing a webinar?
[00:03:51] So we launched our first one earlier this month and it went extremely well.
[00:03:57] It was a three hour event.
[00:03:59] About a hundred people signed up for it and almost everybody stayed the entire three
[00:04:04] hours.
[00:04:04] We had three different sessions.
[00:04:06] We had one from a top producer which you're about to hear.
[00:04:08] We had a coaching session with an agent who got coached live,
[00:04:13] which I think there's so much value for you hearing how he got coached because you
[00:04:18] can sort of get coached along the way too.
[00:04:20] And then we had Kim Rippberg to talk about how to crush it in video.
[00:04:24] So what we're going to do is this was so effective and the feedback was so amazing
[00:04:28] that we're going to share it with the entire audience.
[00:04:31] And we're going to break it up into three parts.
[00:04:34] So you're going to hear just the first session here in a few moments.
[00:04:37] And it's with Greg Pekarski.
[00:04:39] He's one of the top agents in Chicago.
[00:04:41] He did two hundred and ninety million in 2024.
[00:04:44] It was his best year ever.
[00:04:46] And he talks about how he made twenty twenty four his best year.
[00:04:49] And by the way, almost nobody had their best year in twenty twenty four.
[00:04:52] Greg's a fantastic guy.
[00:04:54] And if you're listening to this, you're not going to see his slides.
[00:04:58] So that's okay.
[00:05:00] I don't think you need to see his slides.
[00:05:01] But if you do want to see his slides, you can head over to our YouTube page.
[00:05:06] We have a video version of this.
[00:05:07] You can actually see what he's saying.
[00:05:09] But I don't really think you need to do that.
[00:05:11] Just listen and get a sense of what he's doing to what he what he did last year
[00:05:16] and what he's doing this year to make twenty twenty five even better than twenty twenty four.
[00:05:20] Because I promise you will be able to take something away and with all of our speakers.
[00:05:25] But you're just going to hear the first part now.
[00:05:27] And so so that's coming up in just a few moments.
[00:05:30] What I really want to tell you is we're going to be doing this every single month.
[00:05:34] And we have sponsors now that are helping cover the cost of this.
[00:05:38] So the good news is this is going to be free for all of you.
[00:05:42] We are going to make sure that everybody gets access to every one of these in real time.
[00:05:47] So once a month, we're going to be sending out, you know, an email saying,
[00:05:50] hey, here's our next webinar.
[00:05:52] You know, you can sign up.
[00:05:53] We'll give you a code so it doesn't cost anything for you.
[00:05:56] And then you'll be able to attend live interact with the guests interact with each other.
[00:06:01] And if you're too busy, no problem.
[00:06:03] We'll send you the videos later or you'll be able to listen to the episodes just like you're about to listen to part of it now.
[00:06:08] Okay, I hope you're excited.
[00:06:10] This was so much fun.
[00:06:11] And it was fun for me to interact with the audience too, because I wasn't really part of the presentation.
[00:06:16] I just introduced everyone and I got to chat with you guys.
[00:06:18] And that was really fun for me.
[00:06:20] So anyway, we're going to get right to it.
[00:06:23] My conversation or rather the presentation of Greg Pekarski.
[00:06:27] Stay tuned.
[00:06:41] So this is our first speaker of the day.
[00:06:44] Is a really amazing person.
[00:06:46] He's a friend of mine here as well.
[00:06:48] And I'm really honored to know this guy because not only is he an incredible business man,
[00:06:53] he's just one of the nicest people I've ever met.
[00:06:55] And really grateful that he's part of this.
[00:06:57] So let's talk about Gregory Pekarski.
[00:07:00] So he is the, by the way, his company is Vesta preferred and he is here locally here in
[00:07:05] Chicago.
[00:07:06] He would love, and his team would love your referrals too.
[00:07:08] So keep him in mind if you have people moving in and out of Chicago.
[00:07:11] But Greg Pekarski is the driving force behind Vesta preferred and the Vesta team, the number
[00:07:17] one independent real estate team in Illinois.
[00:07:20] By the way, just to give you a sense of what that means here in Chicago alone, there's
[00:07:23] 47,000 agents.
[00:07:25] There's probably 60,000 total in the state.
[00:07:28] Greg's the number one independent team.
[00:07:30] He has over one billion in sales.
[00:07:33] He has ranked in the top 1.5% of brokers nationwide by real trends.
[00:07:37] Greg's message is rooted in his deep market expertise and unwavering commitment to client
[00:07:42] satisfaction.
[00:07:43] Beyond his own achievements, Greg is dedicated to mentoring the next generation of real estate
[00:07:47] agents at Vesta preferred using his extensive experience to help brokers build thriving
[00:07:52] careers.
[00:07:53] A recognized thought leader, Greg continues to educate both the public and professionals
[00:07:59] on the complexities and opportunities within the real estate market.
[00:08:03] His insights shared through media appearances and speaking engagements have made him a
[00:08:07] trusted voice in the industry.
[00:08:10] He's originally from the Detroit area, but Greg built Vesta preferred from the ground
[00:08:14] up alongside his business partner, Brad Roberts, another fantastic guy that I'm glad to
[00:08:19] know.
[00:08:19] Nationally respected and admired, he uses the skills he developed throughout his career
[00:08:23] to help others transform their lives through real estate.
[00:08:27] He's a passionate advocate for Chicago.
[00:08:29] We need those these days.
[00:08:31] And Greg is on a mission to showcase the greatness of our city.
[00:08:34] And when he's not working, he enjoys spending time with his family, probably embracing
[00:08:38] his role as the least influential person in his home family, but family real estate and
[00:08:45] Chicago define his journey.
[00:08:48] And Greg, welcome.
[00:08:50] Thank you so much for having me beyond appreciate DJ.
[00:08:52] You came up with all that on your own.
[00:08:54] Wow.
[00:08:54] I off the cuff was amazing.
[00:08:57] Off the cuff, man, you really know me and appreciate that.
[00:09:00] Hey, thanks so much for having me on.
[00:09:02] I really appreciate the opportunity.
[00:09:06] Happy New Year, everybody.
[00:09:08] The energy is palpable over here at Vesta preferred.
[00:09:11] So it's like I was I took some time off, but like three days into my vacation, I was
[00:09:18] like ready to kick the door down.
[00:09:19] So couldn't be more excited to start 2025.
[00:09:23] We had an incredible year in 2024.
[00:09:26] And I'm going to be talking about in particular how we do online leads, but a lot of the stuff
[00:09:33] that I'm going to be talking about just kind of talks about how behaviorally you should
[00:09:40] be thinking about your business, which will essentially transpire to the entire operation
[00:09:45] that you run.
[00:09:47] So I have the slides on my side.
[00:09:51] So should I just kind of like go through my own stuff and then you'll kind of follow
[00:09:55] along?
[00:09:57] Yeah.
[00:09:58] Yeah, I can if you want me, I can push the next slide.
[00:10:02] I've got it up.
[00:10:02] So just let me know when you want to go to the next.
[00:10:05] Okay.
[00:10:06] Let's let's then go to the next.
[00:10:09] So just a kind of general oversight of what we're going to be talking about today is lead
[00:10:15] generation is just kind of what I'm known for.
[00:10:18] 
[00:10:18] So like we were a national recognized lead generation online leads team.
[00:10:23] We're a flex team here in Chicago.
[00:10:24] If you guys are familiar with Zillow and we just have perfected the online lead model.
[00:10:30] So I'm going to talk about how how we do that.
[00:10:34] If you want to go more into lead generation tactics in 2025, there's a lot to be that
[00:10:42] to be in with this information.
[00:10:44] So I'll try to go as quickly as possible.
[00:10:47] I know we got we have a minimum amount of time, but that's kind of what this full idea
[00:10:51] is.
[00:10:51] So a few few main things is know your numbers.
[00:10:55] How to know if a lead source is worth pursuing or not.
[00:10:58] I mean, how many people call you and say, hey, I have 500% of sellers.
[00:11:03] I'm looking for an agent in your area.
[00:11:05] And are you one of those?
[00:11:07] Would you like some more leads?
[00:11:08] I almost say no to probably 95% 97% of people that call me.
[00:11:13] And it's because I've learned how to go through the garbage because there is 97% garbage for
[00:11:19] 3% of actual things you should be focusing on.
[00:11:22] And then once you have the leads, what are the tactics that you can use to ensure that
[00:11:27] your closing ratios are as best as possible to give you an idea.
[00:11:32] National averages is about 2 to 3% invest that we do.
[00:11:36] Minimally 10% on the high end, it's 25% closing ratio.
[00:11:40] So there are certain tactics and strategies that we use that I'm going to tell you guys
[00:11:45] about that delivers top of the nation, have it the nation closing ratios.
[00:11:50] So let's begin.
[00:11:52] So real quick, just to kind of acknowledge who I am, what I am, why I'm here speaking.
[00:11:58] Last year we did 270 million closed and pending in 2024, about 540 closed homes.
[00:12:06] And from 2023, we had 200% growth.
[00:12:09] So that was, I'm really proud of that.
[00:12:11] It was a huge year for us last year.
[00:12:13] And it's in a time when the settlement happened.
[00:12:17] All that was just like a lot of pullback.
[00:12:19] We leaned in and through the tactics I'm going to talk about.
[00:12:22] We grew exponentially.
[00:12:23] I also expanded the team to 30 agents.
[00:12:26] So I'm not like a team lead of 200 people.
[00:12:28] I do more with less.
[00:12:31] I only look for the best highest quality agents in two specific categories.
[00:12:37] Attitude and work ethic.
[00:12:39] And those are the things that I look for that I can put into my system that ultimately
[00:12:43] gets agents to then average, about $10 million per head on my team.
[00:12:47] We are the number one highest producing per agent team.
[00:12:51] I know for sure in Chicago, I have to say we probably are competing against a national
[00:12:56] average there as well.
[00:12:57] And the number one, the best thing that I'm just so proud of is last year, we were the
[00:13:02] number one bi-rept team.
[00:13:04] The second in line was over 100 deals behind us.
[00:13:07] So I am very proud to say that we are the bi-represented team of Chicago.
[00:13:12] Let's go.
[00:13:13] All right.
[00:13:14] Next slide.
[00:13:15] How do we do it?
[00:13:16] To one word, guys, it's one word.
[00:13:19] It's consistency.
[00:13:20] The whole idea of lead generation dominance is consistency.
[00:13:28] And in the consistency, what we call our consistent activities are MMAs, money making activities.
[00:13:34] I'll go into those in a little bit in depth further, but essentially you have to understand
[00:13:39] what the formula of success is.
[00:13:41] Success is correctly labeled activities that you execute upon consistently over a long period
[00:13:49] of time.
[00:13:49] Doesn't matter what you're trying to get into if you want to play piano, you want to work
[00:13:52] out, you want to be great at real estate.
[00:13:55] It's about consistently executing every single day on the correct activities over a long
[00:14:03] period of time.
[00:14:04] Weekly, monthly, yearly stuff here.
[00:14:10] And when somebody comes up to me and says, how do you do it?
[00:14:13] Or anyone asks me, what is your secret to success?
[00:14:17] Or like, what is it that I can do right now?
[00:14:19] My answer is always pretty boring.
[00:14:22] It's just do the things that you know that you need to do and don't ever let off.
[00:14:27] I never give a, oh, here's a tactic that's very, nobody else knows about, right?
[00:14:32] Consistency is the main principle of success.
[00:14:36] And I just want to hammer that home, guys, because I'm never going to change my answer
[00:14:40] on that.
[00:14:41] And if you ever are looking for something that is a proven method, is just stay consistent.
[00:14:46] All right, next picture.
[00:14:48] All right, so when we're talking about leads, you cannot take on a lot of leads without
[00:14:55] a foundation.
[00:14:56] And that foundation is found through your systematic approach on how you're going to deliver the
[00:15:01] same exact result every single time so that you can then figure out what and where you
[00:15:07] need to change your flow.
[00:15:10] In my company, we have about 5,200 leads that come in every single day.
[00:15:14] We have numerous lead sources.
[00:15:17] We have a huge ecosystem.
[00:15:19] We have Zillow.
[00:15:20] We have PPC.
[00:15:22] We have AI generation stuff.
[00:15:24] We have referrals.
[00:15:25] I mean, they're just coming in from everywhere.
[00:15:28] And what we've understood and figured out is that every single inflow, every single type
[00:15:34] of lead source has a specific type of cadence, specific type of language that has a better
[00:15:40] closing ratio than not.
[00:15:43] Our CRM, we use follow-up boss.
[00:15:46] And I'm happy to share any systems.
[00:15:49] Anything, nothing here is secret, right?
[00:15:52] There's a lot of people that like to hold the sub-close to the chest.
[00:15:55] I've become successful by sharing everything that I have and just giving people the tools
[00:16:00] to succeed.
[00:16:01] So, I know DJ is monitoring the chat.
[00:16:04] I'm not.
[00:16:04] So, if you have any questions, please throw it out there.
[00:16:06] I will give you an answer right away.
[00:16:08] So our CRM monitors every single action.
[00:16:11] Calls, texts, emails.
[00:16:13] Because the most important thing is understanding what and how the statistics are of your specific
[00:16:20] lead sources so that you can understand a future projections and how to deliver properly.
[00:16:26] Knowing your numbers is everything, guys.
[00:16:29] It's everything.
[00:16:31] Because here's where people fall out.
[00:16:33] They start off, they want to get big into leads.
[00:16:36] They start buying leads or they find a lead source.
[00:16:39] And the problem is getting leads is the easy part.
[00:16:42] The hard part is training yourself to then continuously follow-up.
[00:16:47] I've had leads that I've followed up for five years and they've never contacted me back.
[00:16:53] Until that fifth year something happened.
[00:16:56] I messaged them.
[00:16:56] They're like, Greg, I cannot believe you stayed in touch with me for this long.
[00:17:00] I know who you are.
[00:17:01] I've been following.
[00:17:01] I'm so sorry, but I'm ready to buy.
[00:17:03] It doesn't happen a lot, right?
[00:17:05] Because those are usually dead leads, but I don't ever let up.
[00:17:08] So that when you have a lead that you know that you must call for the 30th time because
[00:17:15] on average, that's how much it takes to call this specific lead source and they pick up,
[00:17:19] it gives you a purpose behind your actions, right?
[00:17:23] Because so many people, they get excited.
[00:17:25] One, two, three.
[00:17:26] But when you're talking about a 2% closing ratio, guys, you have to call 98 people to get
[00:17:30] one yes.
[00:17:31] People usually last 20 to 30 calls and they say, whatever, I'm not going to do this.
[00:17:36] And that is where everybody falls off.
[00:17:38] Consistency is your main policy here.
[00:17:42] Next.
[00:17:43] All right.
[00:17:43] So knowing your numbers, like I was talking about, number one.
[00:17:49] So you have to use a systematic approach to understand that.
[00:17:52] You have to have something that is trackable, right?
[00:17:54] You don't have to use all the fancy CRMs or whatever, but they do it where they contract
[00:17:59] automatically or calls or whatnot.
[00:18:01] You don't have to do it yourself.
[00:18:02] And then it offers you the clarity.
[00:18:05] So here's a really, really good example.
[00:18:07] The most recent example I can give to you guys, exclusive contracts, right?
[00:18:11] The industry went through this massive shake up last year.
[00:18:14] The settlement messed everything up.
[00:18:16] And everybody was really, really worried about it, right?
[00:18:19] We weren't.
[00:18:20] Here's why I was freaking out January, February of last year.
[00:18:24] I was like hyperventilating because I didn't understand it.
[00:18:27] What is this?
[00:18:27] What's going on?
[00:18:27] I went, so many seminars, understood it.
[00:18:30] And I figured out what it is that is going to essentially going to affect the consumer
[00:18:36] the most.
[00:18:36] So we figured out what our pitch was earlier on.
[00:18:39] It came on August 17th.
[00:18:41] I believe it's one of landed.
[00:18:42] We started to exclusively use them in June because I wanted to give my agents a two month
[00:18:48] had start to understand the gap, to understand the negatives, to understand the reason and
[00:18:52] ways that people say no so we can sell around it.
[00:18:56] So one of the ended up happening is we started to see a new metric happen.
[00:19:00] When we were going, let's call it out of 10 leads where maybe we were closing 20% of them,
[00:19:07] right?
[00:19:08] So two out of 10.
[00:19:09] That means that whatever we did before, eight out of 10 leads were going to say f off,
[00:19:15] whatever.
[00:19:17] And we can't go ahead and get that time back.
[00:19:22] What this ended up doing right from the start, you can find out who is real or who is not.
[00:19:27] We caught on to that really fast.
[00:19:30] And what's insane is that we went to a 40% lock in ratio.
[00:19:37] So in my opinion, what happened is that we saved 60% of the time because 60% of people
[00:19:42] said no right away.
[00:19:44] And we locked in 40% of people right from the start and we can focus our energy.
[00:19:48] So we got focus and we doubled our closing ratio.
[00:19:52] Guys, this exploded.
[00:19:54] Our ability to close, to stay focused and it motivated my team to absolutely crush.
[00:20:00] Guys in Q3 and Q4 for the first time in my entire history, my career, we were the number
[00:20:04] one team in Chicago.
[00:20:06] And Q4, by the way, we grew that lead.
[00:20:09] And it's because we understood one specific metric, closing ratio on how you can do with
[00:20:15] your exclusives.
[00:20:17] Understanding your numbers is everything.
[00:20:20] Next.
[00:20:21] All right.
[00:20:22] Consistent execution, baby.
[00:20:24] Man, you guys getting the theme here?
[00:20:26] I'm boring.
[00:20:27] I'm sorry.
[00:20:27] This is what works.
[00:20:30] Consistency is simple, but it's challenging.
[00:20:33] You have to overcome.
[00:20:34] What I've learned from many, many years of watching agents crash and burn, not being successful
[00:20:41] is that what happens is that most people they just can't stay consistent.
[00:20:45] It's really, really hard, right?
[00:20:47] There's a reason why the gym on March 1st looks different than January 1st.
[00:20:53] Everyone starts with great intention.
[00:20:54] Everyone knows what it takes to be in shape.
[00:20:57] But things happen, you know, like, I don't know, like this happens, that, everyone's
[00:21:02] got excuses, right?
[00:21:04] I got excuses.
[00:21:05] I get that.
[00:21:07] But if you can find a way to not allow those excuses to have you fall over and something
[00:21:14] that can keep you engaged, that is what's been the secret recipe of success here at
[00:21:20] Bess.
[00:21:20] You want to see a recipe?
[00:21:21] We do one-on-one coaching.
[00:21:23] My business partner, he coaches every single agent, every single week, one-on-one.
[00:21:29] And he, it's very quick coaching.
[00:21:30] It's not like, hey, how was your week last week?
[00:21:31] Because we know our numbers, right?
[00:21:34] He can meet with Katie.
[00:21:35] And he understands that if you get 10 leads, seven of those 10 should be an appointment
[00:21:41] set.
[00:21:42] Now, if Katie had three appointments set out of the 10, let's listen to your phone calls.
[00:21:46] Let's understand what's going on while you're not getting a ratio that we understand
[00:21:49] you need to be hitting, right?
[00:21:51] So it keeps everybody on their best behaviors and understanding that, hey, I'm going to
[00:21:57] meet with Brad.
[00:21:58] So I have to make sure that I'm hitting these numbers because we give a lot to our agents,
[00:22:02] right?
[00:22:03] My promise to my agents is I'm going to give you more than you give me.
[00:22:06] I'm a lead provider.
[00:22:07] That is what we specialize in.
[00:22:08] And that is why I understand the metrics on what an agent needs to be able to succeed
[00:22:13] in my system.
[00:22:14] It is great attitude, which we're going to talk a little bit and hard work.
[00:22:19] The best work, I think, because this is so hard.
[00:22:23] Leads is the hardest thing that I had to learn in my life.
[00:22:27] Once I understood it, it changed everything for me.
[00:22:31] So here at Best, though, we have a one-on-one coaching.
[00:22:34] I understand a lot of people, they don't have that ability.
[00:22:36] So find a workout buddy.
[00:22:38] Find that one other agent because if somebody is motivated like you, I can promise you,
[00:22:43] it's going to be one of a thousand other people.
[00:22:46] There's not a lot of people that are as motivated as you that wants to be really successful.
[00:22:50] So you've got to find somebody that's actually willing to do it.
[00:22:52] We have a 3% higher rate here.
[00:22:54] It's not because I don't want to hire more people.
[00:22:58] It's because only 3% of people can fit into the system of consistent success.
[00:23:02] So if you're one of those 3%, you've got to find the other 3%.
[00:23:06] So you can motivate each other and you do not fall off.
[00:23:09] A quick little example.
[00:23:11] All agents say, ah, it's my off season, right?
[00:23:15] They love to say that after the summertime.
[00:23:18] I figured out, here's why.
[00:23:20] One day off is three days to get back on.
[00:23:23] That is how much you lose when you take one day off.
[00:23:27] So if you take one week off, it's a month off, right?
[00:23:30] So if you take two months off, which is the summertime,
[00:23:32] everyone gets busy, they stop doing their calls or whatever, what happens?
[00:23:35] Six months off, wintertime, and boom, Shaka Laka, springtime, everybody's busy again.
[00:23:42] We don't ever miss a vest because we stay consistent.
[00:23:44] We don't have a down season, all right?
[00:23:47] That is how you do it.
[00:23:49] All right, next.
[00:23:51] Understanding lead generation models, there's a two stop, there's two step thought process.
[00:23:55] There's long game focus and short game focus.
[00:23:58] Long game focus is where you get your trajectory forever success.
[00:24:01] But it is very, very challenging.
[00:24:03] It is how you become an expert in a specific dominated market, right?
[00:24:07] You have to understand that you can't be everything to everybody.
[00:24:10] You have to dominate a specific market, a niche.
[00:24:13] What my niche is is first time home buyers.
[00:24:16] I call them first time home buyers and first time home buyer plus.
[00:24:18] We dominate the, let's call it 300 to 800,000 market.
[00:24:23] No one touches us in that market.
[00:24:25] And it's because I understand how those buyers think, where they're looking,
[00:24:28] where they're shopping in my net is just the biggest net to catch all the fish.
[00:24:34] And then we understand, I talked to them to then be able to close them.
[00:24:38] So what is your niche?
[00:24:40] What do you like?
[00:24:40] What is it?
[00:24:41] What, what, where and how are you passionate?
[00:24:43] And go in there and put in the work, network, volunteer.
[00:24:48] Do the stuff that you love to do and you will find your people.
[00:24:52] But then you have to do it in a measurable way.
[00:24:54] A really good example is people say, well, I like to network.
[00:24:57] Okay.
[00:24:57] So how do you make it into a measurable success item?
[00:25:02] You, here's an example, get business cards.
[00:25:04] How many business cards can you go when you go to a networking event to then be like,
[00:25:09] all right, my goal is to get five business cards.
[00:25:11] Fantastic.
[00:25:12] All right.
[00:25:13] So once you get those five business cards, what do you do with them?
[00:25:15] You put them into a systematic approach, a follow up.
[00:25:18] Because then you understand that let's say that out of 10 business cards,
[00:25:21] you get one prospect.
[00:25:23] And then out of five prospects or whatever it is going to be your close,
[00:25:30] like you get five prospects for one buyer, just like crazy numbers, right?
[00:25:33] Because then what you can do is you can reverse engineer to understand,
[00:25:38] I'm throwing a lot of numbers here, but like let's just say for example,
[00:25:40] okay, all of a sudden you understand that 30 business cards equals one home sale.
[00:25:45] Do you understand the type of energy that you're going to come into these networking events now?
[00:25:51] Because if I get 30 business cards, I'm going to get a home sold.
[00:25:54] So then you can be like, if I want to sell it out of homes, right?
[00:25:58] Then I need to get an X amount of business card.
[00:26:00] And now you have a purpose behind your action.
[00:26:03] Everything you do needs to be measurable, have a purpose behind it.
[00:26:06] And you have to be able to put it into a system to systematically follow up with them.
[00:26:10] That's how we do it, guys.
[00:26:12] I started this new model, this new team about four years ago.
[00:26:16] We really popped off last year.
[00:26:18] And it's everyone's like, what'd you do?
[00:26:19] How'd you do it?
[00:26:20] It's just because we were consistent for three years before.
[00:26:24] And by the end of the third year, beginning of the fourth, we just went to the hockey stick mode.
[00:26:28] And it's because it's all about cumulative effort that will eventually get you to the next level.
[00:26:34] Takes a long time, guys.
[00:26:35] Took three years.
[00:26:36] Not a lot of people can stick with it, but we did.
[00:26:38] And we were reaping the benefits.
[00:26:40] Next.
[00:26:41] So all right, great.
[00:26:43] Fantastic, Greg.
[00:26:43] I don't have three years.
[00:26:44] What do I do now?
[00:26:45] Short game focus.
[00:26:46] Let's talk about that.
[00:26:48] So there's a lot of stuff like pay for lead generation.
[00:26:51] And that's expensive, but effective.
[00:26:53] If you know, if you know your numbers and you follow the numbers and you understand what specifically you need to go for.
[00:26:59] But you also have to have, you have to have the CRM.
[00:27:01] You have to have the systems ready for that stuff.
[00:27:04] Like you have the ability to get leads now, right?
[00:27:08] But you have to be able to track those things.
[00:27:10] And then you have to be able to financially make sure that it makes sense.
[00:27:12] I don't like to do anything that doesn't give me $3 back for every $1 that I spend.
[00:27:18] 
[00:27:19] So when I go into these places and why do I say no to 97% of people, just because I can just go through the BS already.
[00:27:25] I just know that most like these people that just are selling me bad leads or whatever.
[00:27:29] But then when I get somebody on the hook, I can ask the right questions and most of them fall out because they don't have the answers.
[00:27:35] Ask the right questions.
[00:27:37] Understand what specifically you need to be looking for in the lead sources that are being offered to you to see if it's worth the investment.
[00:27:45] And then put it, do it, believe in yourself and give yourself a minimum of three, hopefully six months to start to see those ratios.
[00:27:51] Because that is about the buying timeline to be able to tell if the lead source is good or not.
[00:27:56] Another idea if you're just starting out, go to a team lead.
[00:28:00] The amount of help team leads need is immense.
[00:28:04] And what I will go to them is like, hey, listen, how many people are in your database?
[00:28:06] How many people are you not contacting?
[00:28:08] What is in your nurture and your spheres?
[00:28:10] Can I contact them for you and I'll give you a 25% referral fee that you can get them back?
[00:28:14] That is exactly the style of flow of the stuff that you need to do to be able to get after it.
[00:28:21] Real estate is a contact sport.
[00:28:24] Remember that.
[00:28:26] All right.
[00:28:27] The power of attitude.
[00:28:30] Guys, this is it.
[00:28:32] 70% of your success comes from attitude.
[00:28:34] 70% of success comes from your attitude.
[00:28:39] It's got nothing to do with activities, with actions and all of that.
[00:28:43] So what do you think you guys should be investing in every single day?
[00:28:48] It's your attitude.
[00:28:49] What makes you happy?
[00:28:51] What makes you feel good?
[00:28:52] I wake up every morning at 4.45.
[00:28:54] I work out.
[00:28:55] I stretch.
[00:28:57] I meditate.
[00:28:57] I get ready because my little gremlins wake up around 6.20 and they are ready to beat my ass.
[00:29:04] Sorry DJ, I got to swear.
[00:29:06] And I love it.
[00:29:07] I love it.
[00:29:08] My little girls, they just crush me and it's just why I am doing what I do.
[00:29:14] It's my why and they are my, I invest in my attitude that way because I come in and I have to
[00:29:19] have so much energy to be able to push every single day to stay on top of my game.
[00:29:24] And then you just do that every single day.
[00:29:26] Guys, it's the butterfly effect.
[00:29:27] You do something every single day.
[00:29:29] It will just start your day off.
[00:29:31] You have to come in because when you have a crap day and you did 97 calls and you're like,
[00:29:36] I can't do this anymore.
[00:29:37] Now when you were one phone call away from that successful call,
[00:29:40] you missed it because your head was down.
[00:29:43] The next call is always the opportunity that you might have.
[00:29:46] So you got to be able to work on that so you can push through and get it going.
[00:29:51] Here's the quote that I want to leave you guys with.
[00:29:52] Whether you think you can or you can't, you're probably right.
[00:29:57] Go Crush 2025.
[00:29:58] If you're in Chicago, I hope that I do a deal with you.
[00:30:02] Thank you so much for this opportunity.
[00:30:04] I love it.
[00:30:06] All right, let's give a round of applause.
[00:30:09] Everyone's muted, but we'll applaud for Greg and let him know in the notes.
[00:30:17] You know, again, attitude, right?
[00:30:19] We heard a lot about attitude and consistency.
[00:30:23] Greg, I've got a few questions for you.
[00:30:25] No.
[00:30:25] My first question and thank you.
[00:30:27] Please put your questions in the chat.
[00:30:29] We will do our best to either unmute you or we'll ask on your behalf,
[00:30:33] but we want to get your questions answered.
[00:30:34] But I have a question.
[00:30:35] So for sphere of influence leads, so they, you know, the people that are closest to you,
[00:30:41] if you're not purchasing leads or acquiring sort of cold leads,
[00:30:45] what might you suggest as a good consistent strategy to stay in touch with those people?
[00:30:50] So that when they do need you, they're not, you know, going with someone else.
[00:30:54] Yeah, so, you know, the center of influence are to me,
[00:30:59] the people that just want to hear from you, right?
[00:31:02] Like we're talking about people that like hearing from you or whatever.
[00:31:04] So I have a cadence of calling those people four times a year.
[00:31:07] So once a quarter.
[00:31:09] And it gets a little weird and it's like, hey, how's it going?
[00:31:11] What's going to, so I like, I also like to do two events a year.
[00:31:14] So that I can kind of like piggyback one call of how are you,
[00:31:18] another one, hey, come to my event, right?
[00:31:20] And you guys don't have to go crazy.
[00:31:21] Like you can just do something like a partner with the lender,
[00:31:24] do a happy hour, say, hey, I just want to see you do like a summer one and do
[00:31:30] out. So I mean, beginning of the year, just do something that is kind of like, you know,
[00:31:34] right there. And then it gives you a reason to phone call, right?
[00:31:36] So like that's what I do for my agents.
[00:31:38] I make it easy for them.
[00:31:39] But do like four touches a year, do some newsletters.
[00:31:42] And if they are, your center of influence, they'll come back to you.
[00:31:46] That's great.
[00:31:48] Another question from the chat was from Mike McElroy who said,
[00:31:53] what are the questions that turn you off to a lead source?
[00:31:56] Because we, look, we all get those emails and these cold emails from these lead companies
[00:32:01] that are like, well, they don't even say where they're from.
[00:32:03] Oftentimes you just get these these emails all day long.
[00:32:06] We all get them.
[00:32:07] How would you go about, you know, interviewing these people,
[00:32:10] making sure that they are actually can deliver?
[00:32:12] What's your proven closing ratio and give me two referrals of people that work with you
[00:32:15] and are successful?
[00:32:16] That will, that will knock out 98% of people.
[00:32:20] Closing ratio and a, give me a referral of two to three people that use you
[00:32:25] that can, that can abide by that closing ratio.
[00:32:27] It will knock out everybody.
[00:32:29] That's a great, great question.
[00:32:31] Travis asked, is there a reason you target $3 return on every $1 spent?
[00:32:37] Just it's what we found that's the most profitable like expectation without getting too crazy
[00:32:42] and something that is like worth your time because the amount of energy you need to spend to be
[00:32:47] able to close these online leads, it's got to be able to pay you back significantly.
[00:32:52] So you can't just be making like 20 cents, you know, additional from a dollar spend.
[00:32:57] You got to be able to like put that in because then you got to remember if you're waiting three to
[00:33:01] six months, you might not get your first check for six months and you're usually spending thousands
[00:33:07] of dollars.
[00:33:08] Right?
[00:33:08] So you'd be like, it's got to pay you back pretty, pretty well, pretty quickly.
[00:33:12] The other thing that you guys have to think about, there's a lot of referral programs out there as
[00:33:16] well, but you don't have to pay for upfront.
[00:33:19] There is, I don't Redfin has a really good partner program.
[00:33:23] I used to be in that.
[00:33:24] Obsidian.
[00:33:25] Obsidian, like, you know, you look for those like I would pay you for the referral and it's performance-based.
[00:33:31] Right?
[00:33:32] So it's something where are you fast on the phone?
[00:33:35] Are you available 24 7?
[00:33:37] Are you ready to lose your weekends?
[00:33:39] Do you hate evening like, hey, but are you able to work on your weekends?
[00:33:41] Those answers are yes, you'll beat up everybody else on those and you'll rank up the platform,
[00:33:45] but you just got to put in the work and you got to find those avenues of free leads that
[00:33:50] you just pay it on the back and with the referral sources.
[00:33:52] I have a question.
[00:33:53] How much harder and you know a lot of agents locally here as well as all over the country?
[00:33:59] How much harder do you think your agents work hour-wise?
[00:34:03] And I mean this in a very complimentary way because I think, you know,
[00:34:07] since there isn't much accountability in this business and you're sort of providing
[00:34:11] that structure, is that really the main secret to the success is just putting in more time?
[00:34:17] Um, the whole principle behind real estate, most people say, um, just work harder.
[00:34:24] I think that that is a lazy mindset.
[00:34:27] The true mindset is work smarter.
[00:34:30] So what we do is with our MMAs, my agents can complete their day within two to three hours.
[00:34:35] That's how focused their activities are, right?
[00:34:37] Like that is how what I want them to do because I want the rest of the time.
[00:34:41] Is to focus on themselves, go to stuff that you like.
[00:34:44] Mental health is a huge thing that we focus on here and best to prefer.
[00:34:47] And if you are very focused on your activities, you should be able to complete in your day
[00:34:52] within three, maybe four hours of focused activities if you know what you're doing.
[00:34:57] Right?
[00:34:58] But the availability, they have to be available 21st up.
[00:35:01] Right?
[00:35:02] So like, because phone calls come in any point in time, we have numerous from all these different sources.
[00:35:07] And it's first, first to lead, right?
[00:35:09] We have showing time tours.
[00:35:10] You have to answer the phone and automatically appoints a poor, you'll go to the next agent.
[00:35:14] So I think it's more about working smarter to be able to get more business and just the availability,
[00:35:20] the realistic availability, um, from let's call it 80m to 9pm Monday through Sunday,
[00:35:26] so that you're ready to answer the phone.
[00:35:27] You got to put in the work.
[00:35:28] You got to essentially dedicate two years of your life to do this.
[00:35:31] Two years of your life.
[00:35:32] If you're not ready to do that, do not get into leads.
[00:35:35] And what we're talking about is three to four hours of MMA money making activities a day.
[00:35:39] Yes.
[00:35:41] Yes.
[00:35:42] I love that.
[00:35:43] Now Patrick Browning asked at what point did you create your team?
[00:35:47] And was this because you didn't have the bandwidth for the amount of work required?
[00:35:51] Or were you just aggressively growing your business?
[00:35:53] Yeah.
[00:35:53] Perfect question.
[00:35:55] Um, I failed on three iterations of teams before this team.
[00:35:59] And before this team started, I looked at my business partners.
[00:36:01] I don't want to, I don't ever want a team again.
[00:36:03] Um, so the reason why we started this team is because it's not that, you know,
[00:36:11] we couldn't handle the bandwidth.
[00:36:12] It's that we didn't figure out the right model that would ultimately mesh with the way that
[00:36:19] we like to coach and guide and work, right?
[00:36:21] We are all about value at.
[00:36:24] We always give value to our agents, but very few agents are essentially able to take that run
[00:36:30] with it and execute consistently.
[00:36:32] So once we figured out this right model, right?
[00:36:35] And we actually, it wasn't, it was in the same time we got onto Flex.
[00:36:39] It was like, uh, this is a little bit too good to be true with the closing ratios,
[00:36:42] all that stuff.
[00:36:43] I put in the work.
[00:36:44] I closed six homes in the first month.
[00:36:45] I was like, whoa, dude, whoa.
[00:36:48] And Zillow was like, hey, listen, we're willing to grow this with you.
[00:36:51] Um, we can go, we can four or five extra lead flow.
[00:36:54] Are you able to do it?
[00:36:55] And I'm like, uh, yeah, give me a moment.
[00:36:57] And then I went out on this, what does the ideal agent profile look like to be able to do this?
[00:37:04] And that is what we've been working on to get the right people into the right positions.
[00:37:08] Because one of my agents performs it about three to four normal average agents, right?
[00:37:14] So it's, it's a matter of opportunity tied with a lot of failure tied with the understanding
[00:37:22] of what we needed to do.
[00:37:23] So I guess it was experience of failure to know where we were going and is kind of like
[00:37:28] everything just kind of happened all at once and, and that, that's where we're at now.
[00:37:32] Okay.
[00:37:33] Leah Hill asks, as someone who has not previously worked for Eddie brokerage,
[00:37:37] what advice do you have to stand out to brokerages with no experience or sales under your belt?
[00:37:42] Is sales something that would deter you from hiring or do you focus mainly on attitude and ethic?
[00:37:48] So you're, so the, so this agent is want to make sure they don't have any experience and they're
[00:37:52] trying to stand out for the brokers to get hired.
[00:37:57] I believe so.
[00:37:58] Leah, you can, the answer for you is your thinking of it in a completely wrong way.
[00:38:03] They brokerage better knock your socks off who work there.
[00:38:08] Okay. Too many brokers under value themselves and don't understand what a value you are to be
[00:38:17] able to go and put in the work and be consistent about it with a great attitude.
[00:38:21] The 3% of my hires, right? 3% of people are hired here because that is exclusively what I look for.
[00:38:27] Yes, it'd be good to have some experience or whatever, but if you are just this like ready to
[00:38:32] crush, you have an amazing attitude and you have this, I'm just going to do whatever it takes and
[00:38:38] I'm going to get there. You will outperform 90% of the industry coming here. You just will.
[00:38:43] So what you need to be looking for is you need to be looking for the right brokerage that can support
[00:38:49] your ambitions. Listen, we had a lot of people, most of my agents come from big brokerages,
[00:38:56] and it's not that they're bad, they're great at branding. Just when you get there, you're on an
[00:39:00] aisle. They don't offer you anything. So it's like you don't have leads. I mean, should they have
[00:39:05] some online coaching or whatever, but who in the office? You've got to go in there. Who's the
[00:39:09] most successful broker in the office that you're looking at? And you want to go there?
[00:39:13] And I would interview them. What are they support you? How has your business grown you?
[00:39:17] Right? When it comes to me and big brokerages come in and they try to recruit me or whatever,
[00:39:23] I'm like, why? What do you provide for me? I'm producing your entire team. What are you talking
[00:39:29] about? Like you want me to come to you so I give you more value? Get out of here. You need to be
[00:39:34] looking at yourself as the value asset and the brokerage is the piece that can help you get to where
[00:39:40] you're trying to get to. That's how you got to be thinking about it. A few quick questions left
[00:39:46] for Greg here. Boy, you're just getting more and more questions, which is amazing.
[00:39:50] Mike McElroy asks, do you have ISAs or do your agents make first contact with leads?
[00:39:55] Hi, baby. I love you. How are you, man? Good to see you. Happy New Year.
[00:39:59] The ISA model failed. The reason is because no one's going to ever talk to a lead better than you.
[00:40:05] We're playing around AI. The only reason is because we are going to mass volume sources like
[00:40:15] Facebook. The worst lead source in the world is Facebook. The reason that I'm going into them
[00:40:21] is because it's the cheapest. What I understand is that if I can get something cheap and if out of
[00:40:26] a thousand leads, I can close 10 deals and I can do it through AI, then it becomes very profitable
[00:40:34] for me and it all starts with knowing your numbers. ISAs were not good for the lead sources we
[00:40:41] were having. They weren't really doing that well for me. Maybe I had the wrong ISAs, maybe, I don't
[00:40:46] know. But what I learned, we took the ISA model away because I want my agents to talk to the people
[00:40:51] right away from the start. Valeria asks what platform to use for CRM. You mentioned that follow-up
[00:40:57] boss. We just pancored by the way. Coming from the last year, I can tell you, it's
[00:41:04] barren on amazing for real estate. Awesome. Nicole asks, do you find that paid referral
[00:41:10] sources to be better quality leads, leads to the close, then leads generated from open houses
[00:41:17] or hosting home buying webinars? In other words, leads from paid referral sources versus
[00:41:21] open houses or doing events. It depends, right? But I would say almost always, your efforts will
[00:41:28] breed better leads. It's just when you think about it, the harder it is to get the lead,
[00:41:34] probably the higher quality it is. Use that formula and it will probably guide you towards where
[00:41:40] you've got to be putting your efforts in. But do stuff that you like to do. Don't just do things to
[00:41:45] do them. If you're going to do the open house, make a metric behind it. Are you doing certain
[00:41:51] types of promotions that you're trying to get people in and then be like, all right, cool. How many
[00:41:55] open house buyers come in on average are on represented? How many of those unrepresented buyers
[00:42:01] can I get to close? Because then you can get really excited. It's cool. There's going to be
[00:42:05] another representative buyer. I know five of these I get a lead. Get yourself excited with your
[00:42:09] activities because you got to know your numbers. I know there are still some agents that are
[00:42:14] nervous about asking buyers for signing the agreement and possibly asking for direct payment.
[00:42:21] You said that didn't scare you. You guys figured out your pitch there.
[00:42:25] You said not only did it not make things worse, it actually made things better and your close ratio
[00:42:31] went up. Can you speak to that for a little bit? Yeah. It's changed everything for us.
[00:42:37] I felt it was going to be a massive competitive advantage for us. My God was I right. Here's why
[00:42:43] brokers don't know how to sell themselves. They don't know how to sell their value. There's a
[00:42:47] secondary type of pitch now. There used to be first and foremost a home consultation. That was the
[00:42:53] first. Guys, the first pitch now is a broker consultation. You see what I'm saying? We've created
[00:42:59] an entire pitch deck on why we are the right broker that they should be using and it's all value
[00:43:05] base. What are your four points that you offer that nobody else can compete with? For example,
[00:43:11] I went back and I looked at all of our closed sales that we then sold again and I figured out
[00:43:17] we make people on average $45,000 when they buy with us and then sell with us.
[00:43:23] I say that point and they're like, whoa, because you guys have to understand if somebody sees you as
[00:43:30] an asset, they're signing right away. They see you as an expense. You're done. You are nervous
[00:43:36] right now whoever asks that question because you see yourself as an expense. Start thinking
[00:43:41] yourself as an asset. They are lucky to be talking to you because of what is your value prop.
[00:43:47] Get good at that. Get good at 32nd pitch and then get good at a five minute presentation.
[00:43:52] You'll knock it out of the water. Last question from Tim Littleton. What advice do you have for a
[00:43:58] broker who has just moved to a new area and is just getting started in their real estate career?
[00:44:03] I mean, it depends on what you want to sell, right? If I was to start somewhere new, right?
[00:44:09] And I was kind of like to do my thing. I would figure out niche wise, right? Where and how
[00:44:18] there's an opportunity. And then I would look at see who are the best performing brokers in that
[00:44:23] specific niche. Like let's say you want to be the best at high-rise selling of the gold cost,
[00:44:27] right? Who is doing the best and how does this go? Call them. The best top-producing brokers,
[00:44:33] guys. They're the most open, honest, and willing to give because we understand the pie is so big.
[00:44:39] It's so big that like at the end of the day, what am I holding this close to my chest? I'm not
[00:44:46] nervous. I'm not worried. I want to share. I want to bring great brokers into this industry because
[00:44:51] there's too many people that think that would car salesmen. Nothing that gets car salesmen,
[00:44:55] I look car salesmen, but the idea of like a sleazy salesman or whatever and we got to get that
[00:45:01] out. So if you just are starting, you're coming into a new niche, a new market, kind of figure out
[00:45:06] where and how you want to focus and then just become the best at that and understand where those
[00:45:11] people, where those buyers are at and just start marketing to that. I mean, the other day I'm really
[00:45:15] good at online leads. You can place me anywhere and I'll start selling like that because I understand
[00:45:20] how and where to formulate. That's my niche. But like figure out what you like to do, where you want
[00:45:25] to be, who you can attract and then go go interview the best people in that niche and then just replicate
[00:45:30] their system, find out their MMAs. What do you do? What's the numbers? How many people do you
[00:45:35] got to call? People tell you, then you put it into a stat, like you put it into your equation,
[00:45:40] then you just backwards and then understand that if I need to call 10 people today, I'll get one lead.
[00:45:44] Fantastic. Go call those 10 people. Understand your numbers.
[00:45:46] But that 100% agree on asking for advice from already successful agents. This is how we book
[00:45:53] guests for how we initially we don't really ask guests anymore. They come to us more than we go
[00:45:58] to them. But when we first started, I thought no one's going to want to share their secrets and
[00:46:02] boy was I wrong because you probably don't see other agents as competition. Not guessing.
[00:46:08] Not. I love you guys. Instagram. Let's chat. Speaking of that, we will have all of Greg's social
[00:46:16] social links sent out to you. We were get that to you. Please follow him all over the place. He
[00:46:21] is a great person to follow and emulate and duplicate his success with his and again, how generous
[00:46:27] was this of Greg to do this? So please again send him a message that let him know you appreciate it.
[00:46:32] And we're going to take a quick break. We'll see everyone in about five minutes. Thanks, Greg.
[00:46:36] Thank you guys. Go Crush 2025.

Now as a real estate recruiter, I can tell you the answer is always yes. But most agents aren't looking to move right now. So how do you know who to contact? Well, what if I were to tell you there's a recruiting and retention tool powered by artificial intelligence that shows you exactly which agents in your local market are looking to leave their brokerage right now and which agents at your own firm are also looking to leave you? Now, I've been recruiting Realters for 15 years and I've hired over 2,000 agents. I can tell you with no exaggeration, this is the tool I've been waiting for. Corded's AI looks for trends across dozens of variables for each agent in your market and shows you which agents they believe are likely to move. Not only does it do that, but Corded's AI went and visited my recruiting website and read everything I offer. So now when I'm recruiting, Corded's AI tells me exactly what to say based on that agent's needs and what my brokerage can offer. It even writes emails for me. I've never seen anything like it and I use it every single day. Now if you are looking to grow your brokerage, Corded.io is the best tool out there. Visit Corded.io to schedule a demo again. That's Corded.io. And now onto the show. Hello and welcome to Keeping It Real, the largest podcast made by Real Estate agents and four Real Estate agents. My name is DJ Paris. I am your guide and host through the show. And we have a whole new thing we're doing today. So I want to talk about it. So bear with me for just a minute while I explain what you're about to listen to. Because it's really exciting and it's the first time we've done it and we can't wait to share it with all of you. So I've always had this sort of challenge which was we have so many listeners. We have about 20 to 30,000 agents that listen to every single episode we do. We're so grateful for that and grateful to all of you who are listening now. And the challenge though is it's usually like a one-way communication, right? I talk to the guests. You're not able to interact with the guests very effectively other than sending them emails afterwards or hitting them up on social media. So I thought, well, how could we sort of engage the audience in real time with the guests and we thought about doing a webinar? So we launched our first one earlier this month and it went extremely well. It was a three hour event. About a hundred people signed up for it and almost everybody stayed the entire three hours. We had three different sessions. We had one from a top producer which you're about to hear. We had a coaching session with an agent who got coached live, which I think there's so much value for you hearing how he got coached because you can sort of get coached along the way too. And then we had Kim Rippberg to talk about how to crush it in video. So what we're going to do is this was so effective and the feedback was so amazing that we're going to share it with the entire audience. And we're going to break it up into three parts. So you're going to hear just the first session here in a few moments. And it's with Greg Pekarski. He's one of the top agents in Chicago. He did two hundred and ninety million in 2024. It was his best year ever. And he talks about how he made twenty twenty four his best year. And by the way, almost nobody had their best year in twenty twenty four. Greg's a fantastic guy. And if you're listening to this, you're not going to see his slides. So that's okay. I don't think you need to see his slides. But if you do want to see his slides, you can head over to our YouTube page. We have a video version of this. You can actually see what he's saying. But I don't really think you need to do that. Just listen and get a sense of what he's doing to what he what he did last year and what he's doing this year to make twenty twenty five even better than twenty twenty four. Because I promise you will be able to take something away and with all of our speakers. But you're just going to hear the first part now. And so so that's coming up in just a few moments. What I really want to tell you is we're going to be doing this every single month. And we have sponsors now that are helping cover the cost of this. So the good news is this is going to be free for all of you. We are going to make sure that everybody gets access to every one of these in real time. So once a month, we're going to be sending out, you know, an email saying, hey, here's our next webinar. You know, you can sign up. We'll give you a code so it doesn't cost anything for you. And then you'll be able to attend live interact with the guests interact with each other. And if you're too busy, no problem. We'll send you the videos later or you'll be able to listen to the episodes just like you're about to listen to part of it now. Okay, I hope you're excited. This was so much fun. And it was fun for me to interact with the audience too, because I wasn't really part of the presentation. I just introduced everyone and I got to chat with you guys. And that was really fun for me. So anyway, we're going to get right to it. My conversation or rather the presentation of Greg Pekarski. Stay tuned. So this is our first speaker of the day. Is a really amazing person. He's a friend of mine here as well. And I'm really honored to know this guy because not only is he an incredible business man, he's just one of the nicest people I've ever met. And really grateful that he's part of this. So let's talk about Gregory Pekarski. So he is the, by the way, his company is Vesta preferred and he is here locally here in Chicago. He would love, and his team would love your referrals too. So keep him in mind if you have people moving in and out of Chicago. But Greg Pekarski is the driving force behind Vesta preferred and the Vesta team, the number one independent real estate team in Illinois. By the way, just to give you a sense of what that means here in Chicago alone, there's 47,000 agents. There's probably 60,000 total in the state. Greg's the number one independent team. He has over one billion in sales. He has ranked in the top 1.5% of brokers nationwide by real trends. Greg's message is rooted in his deep market expertise and unwavering commitment to client satisfaction. Beyond his own achievements, Greg is dedicated to mentoring the next generation of real estate agents at Vesta preferred using his extensive experience to help brokers build thriving careers. A recognized thought leader, Greg continues to educate both the public and professionals on the complexities and opportunities within the real estate market. His insights shared through media appearances and speaking engagements have made him a trusted voice in the industry. He's originally from the Detroit area, but Greg built Vesta preferred from the ground up alongside his business partner, Brad Roberts, another fantastic guy that I'm glad to know. Nationally respected and admired, he uses the skills he developed throughout his career to help others transform their lives through real estate. He's a passionate advocate for Chicago. We need those these days. And Greg is on a mission to showcase the greatness of our city. And when he's not working, he enjoys spending time with his family, probably embracing his role as the least influential person in his home family, but family real estate and Chicago define his journey. And Greg, welcome. Thank you so much for having me beyond appreciate DJ. You came up with all that on your own. Wow. I off the cuff was amazing. Off the cuff, man, you really know me and appreciate that. Hey, thanks so much for having me on. I really appreciate the opportunity. Happy New Year, everybody. The energy is palpable over here at Vesta preferred. So it's like I was I took some time off, but like three days into my vacation, I was like ready to kick the door down. So couldn't be more excited to start 2025. We had an incredible year in 2024. And I'm going to be talking about in particular how we do online leads, but a lot of the stuff that I'm going to be talking about just kind of talks about how behaviorally you should be thinking about your business, which will essentially transpire to the entire operation that you run. So I have the slides on my side. So should I just kind of like go through my own stuff and then you'll kind of follow along? Yeah. Yeah, I can if you want me, I can push the next slide. I've got it up. So just let me know when you want to go to the next. Okay. Let's let's then go to the next. So just a kind of general oversight of what we're going to be talking about today is lead generation is just kind of what I'm known for. So like we were a national recognized lead generation online leads team. We're a flex team here in Chicago. If you guys are familiar with Zillow and we just have perfected the online lead model. So I'm going to talk about how how we do that. If you want to go more into lead generation tactics in 2025, there's a lot to be that to be in with this information. So I'll try to go as quickly as possible. I know we got we have a minimum amount of time, but that's kind of what this full idea is. So a few few main things is know your numbers. How to know if a lead source is worth pursuing or not. I mean, how many people call you and say, hey, I have 500% of sellers. I'm looking for an agent in your area. And are you one of those? Would you like some more leads? I almost say no to probably 95% 97% of people that call me. And it's because I've learned how to go through the garbage because there is 97% garbage for 3% of actual things you should be focusing on. And then once you have the leads, what are the tactics that you can use to ensure that your closing ratios are as best as possible to give you an idea. National averages is about 2 to 3% invest that we do. Minimally 10% on the high end, it's 25% closing ratio. So there are certain tactics and strategies that we use that I'm going to tell you guys about that delivers top of the nation, have it the nation closing ratios. So let's begin. So real quick, just to kind of acknowledge who I am, what I am, why I'm here speaking. Last year we did 270 million closed and pending in 2024, about 540 closed homes. And from 2023, we had 200% growth. So that was, I'm really proud of that. It was a huge year for us last year. And it's in a time when the settlement happened. All that was just like a lot of pullback. We leaned in and through the tactics I'm going to talk about. We grew exponentially. I also expanded the team to 30 agents. So I'm not like a team lead of 200 people. I do more with less. I only look for the best highest quality agents in two specific categories. Attitude and work ethic. And those are the things that I look for that I can put into my system that ultimately gets agents to then average, about $10 million per head on my team. We are the number one highest producing per agent team. I know for sure in Chicago, I have to say we probably are competing against a national average there as well. And the number one, the best thing that I'm just so proud of is last year, we were the number one bi-rept team. The second in line was over 100 deals behind us. So I am very proud to say that we are the bi-represented team of Chicago. Let's go. All right. Next slide. How do we do it? To one word, guys, it's one word. It's consistency. The whole idea of lead generation dominance is consistency. And in the consistency, what we call our consistent activities are MMAs, money making activities. I'll go into those in a little bit in depth further, but essentially you have to understand what the formula of success is. Success is correctly labeled activities that you execute upon consistently over a long period of time. Doesn't matter what you're trying to get into if you want to play piano, you want to work out, you want to be great at real estate. It's about consistently executing every single day on the correct activities over a long period of time. Weekly, monthly, yearly stuff here. And when somebody comes up to me and says, how do you do it? Or anyone asks me, what is your secret to success? Or like, what is it that I can do right now? My answer is always pretty boring. It's just do the things that you know that you need to do and don't ever let off. I never give a, oh, here's a tactic that's very, nobody else knows about, right? Consistency is the main principle of success. And I just want to hammer that home, guys, because I'm never going to change my answer on that. And if you ever are looking for something that is a proven method, is just stay consistent. All right, next picture. All right, so when we're talking about leads, you cannot take on a lot of leads without a foundation. And that foundation is found through your systematic approach on how you're going to deliver the same exact result every single time so that you can then figure out what and where you need to change your flow. In my company, we have about 5,200 leads that come in every single day. We have numerous lead sources. We have a huge ecosystem. We have Zillow. We have PPC. We have AI generation stuff. We have referrals. I mean, they're just coming in from everywhere. And what we've understood and figured out is that every single inflow, every single type of lead source has a specific type of cadence, specific type of language that has a better closing ratio than not. Our CRM, we use follow-up boss. And I'm happy to share any systems. Anything, nothing here is secret, right? There's a lot of people that like to hold the sub-close to the chest. I've become successful by sharing everything that I have and just giving people the tools to succeed. So, I know DJ is monitoring the chat. I'm not. So, if you have any questions, please throw it out there. I will give you an answer right away. So our CRM monitors every single action. Calls, texts, emails. Because the most important thing is understanding what and how the statistics are of your specific lead sources so that you can understand a future projections and how to deliver properly. Knowing your numbers is everything, guys. It's everything. Because here's where people fall out. They start off, they want to get big into leads. They start buying leads or they find a lead source. And the problem is getting leads is the easy part. The hard part is training yourself to then continuously follow-up. I've had leads that I've followed up for five years and they've never contacted me back. Until that fifth year something happened. I messaged them. They're like, Greg, I cannot believe you stayed in touch with me for this long. I know who you are. I've been following. I'm so sorry, but I'm ready to buy. It doesn't happen a lot, right? Because those are usually dead leads, but I don't ever let up. So that when you have a lead that you know that you must call for the 30th time because on average, that's how much it takes to call this specific lead source and they pick up, it gives you a purpose behind your actions, right? Because so many people, they get excited. One, two, three. But when you're talking about a 2% closing ratio, guys, you have to call 98 people to get one yes. People usually last 20 to 30 calls and they say, whatever, I'm not going to do this. And that is where everybody falls off. Consistency is your main policy here. Next. All right. So knowing your numbers, like I was talking about, number one. So you have to use a systematic approach to understand that. You have to have something that is trackable, right? You don't have to use all the fancy CRMs or whatever, but they do it where they contract automatically or calls or whatnot. You don't have to do it yourself. And then it offers you the clarity. So here's a really, really good example. The most recent example I can give to you guys, exclusive contracts, right? The industry went through this massive shake up last year. The settlement messed everything up. And everybody was really, really worried about it, right? We weren't. Here's why I was freaking out January, February of last year. I was like hyperventilating because I didn't understand it. What is this? What's going on? I went, so many seminars, understood it. And I figured out what it is that is going to essentially going to affect the consumer the most. So we figured out what our pitch was earlier on. It came on August 17th. I believe it's one of landed. We started to exclusively use them in June because I wanted to give my agents a two month had start to understand the gap, to understand the negatives, to understand the reason and ways that people say no so we can sell around it. So one of the ended up happening is we started to see a new metric happen. When we were going, let's call it out of 10 leads where maybe we were closing 20% of them, right? So two out of 10. That means that whatever we did before, eight out of 10 leads were going to say f off, whatever. And we can't go ahead and get that time back. What this ended up doing right from the start, you can find out who is real or who is not. We caught on to that really fast. And what's insane is that we went to a 40% lock in ratio. So in my opinion, what happened is that we saved 60% of the time because 60% of people said no right away. And we locked in 40% of people right from the start and we can focus our energy. So we got focus and we doubled our closing ratio. Guys, this exploded. Our ability to close, to stay focused and it motivated my team to absolutely crush. Guys in Q3 and Q4 for the first time in my entire history, my career, we were the number one team in Chicago. And Q4, by the way, we grew that lead. And it's because we understood one specific metric, closing ratio on how you can do with your exclusives. Understanding your numbers is everything. Next. All right. Consistent execution, baby. Man, you guys getting the theme here? I'm boring. I'm sorry. This is what works. Consistency is simple, but it's challenging. You have to overcome. What I've learned from many, many years of watching agents crash and burn, not being successful is that what happens is that most people they just can't stay consistent. It's really, really hard, right? There's a reason why the gym on March 1st looks different than January 1st. Everyone starts with great intention. Everyone knows what it takes to be in shape. But things happen, you know, like, I don't know, like this happens, that, everyone's got excuses, right? I got excuses. I get that. But if you can find a way to not allow those excuses to have you fall over and something that can keep you engaged, that is what's been the secret recipe of success here at Bess. You want to see a recipe? We do one-on-one coaching. My business partner, he coaches every single agent, every single week, one-on-one. And he, it's very quick coaching. It's not like, hey, how was your week last week? Because we know our numbers, right? He can meet with Katie. And he understands that if you get 10 leads, seven of those 10 should be an appointment set. Now, if Katie had three appointments set out of the 10, let's listen to your phone calls. Let's understand what's going on while you're not getting a ratio that we understand you need to be hitting, right? So it keeps everybody on their best behaviors and understanding that, hey, I'm going to meet with Brad. So I have to make sure that I'm hitting these numbers because we give a lot to our agents, right? My promise to my agents is I'm going to give you more than you give me. I'm a lead provider. That is what we specialize in. And that is why I understand the metrics on what an agent needs to be able to succeed in my system. It is great attitude, which we're going to talk a little bit and hard work. The best work, I think, because this is so hard. Leads is the hardest thing that I had to learn in my life. Once I understood it, it changed everything for me. So here at Best, though, we have a one-on-one coaching. I understand a lot of people, they don't have that ability. So find a workout buddy. Find that one other agent because if somebody is motivated like you, I can promise you, it's going to be one of a thousand other people. There's not a lot of people that are as motivated as you that wants to be really successful. So you've got to find somebody that's actually willing to do it. We have a 3% higher rate here. It's not because I don't want to hire more people. It's because only 3% of people can fit into the system of consistent success. So if you're one of those 3%, you've got to find the other 3%. So you can motivate each other and you do not fall off. A quick little example. All agents say, ah, it's my off season, right? They love to say that after the summertime. I figured out, here's why. One day off is three days to get back on. That is how much you lose when you take one day off. So if you take one week off, it's a month off, right? So if you take two months off, which is the summertime, everyone gets busy, they stop doing their calls or whatever, what happens? Six months off, wintertime, and boom, Shaka Laka, springtime, everybody's busy again. We don't ever miss a vest because we stay consistent. We don't have a down season, all right? That is how you do it. All right, next. Understanding lead generation models, there's a two stop, there's two step thought process. There's long game focus and short game focus. Long game focus is where you get your trajectory forever success. But it is very, very challenging. It is how you become an expert in a specific dominated market, right? You have to understand that you can't be everything to everybody. You have to dominate a specific market, a niche. What my niche is is first time home buyers. I call them first time home buyers and first time home buyer plus. We dominate the, let's call it 300 to 800,000 market. No one touches us in that market. And it's because I understand how those buyers think, where they're looking, where they're shopping in my net is just the biggest net to catch all the fish. And then we understand, I talked to them to then be able to close them. So what is your niche? What do you like? What is it? What, what, where and how are you passionate? And go in there and put in the work, network, volunteer. Do the stuff that you love to do and you will find your people. But then you have to do it in a measurable way. A really good example is people say, well, I like to network. Okay. So how do you make it into a measurable success item? You, here's an example, get business cards. How many business cards can you go when you go to a networking event to then be like, all right, my goal is to get five business cards. Fantastic. All right. So once you get those five business cards, what do you do with them? You put them into a systematic approach, a follow up. Because then you understand that let's say that out of 10 business cards, you get one prospect. And then out of five prospects or whatever it is going to be your close, like you get five prospects for one buyer, just like crazy numbers, right? Because then what you can do is you can reverse engineer to understand, I'm throwing a lot of numbers here, but like let's just say for example, okay, all of a sudden you understand that 30 business cards equals one home sale. Do you understand the type of energy that you're going to come into these networking events now? Because if I get 30 business cards, I'm going to get a home sold. So then you can be like, if I want to sell it out of homes, right? Then I need to get an X amount of business card. And now you have a purpose behind your action. Everything you do needs to be measurable, have a purpose behind it. And you have to be able to put it into a system to systematically follow up with them. That's how we do it, guys. I started this new model, this new team about four years ago. We really popped off last year. And it's everyone's like, what'd you do? How'd you do it? It's just because we were consistent for three years before. And by the end of the third year, beginning of the fourth, we just went to the hockey stick mode. And it's because it's all about cumulative effort that will eventually get you to the next level. Takes a long time, guys. Took three years. Not a lot of people can stick with it, but we did. And we were reaping the benefits. Next. So all right, great. Fantastic, Greg. I don't have three years. What do I do now? Short game focus. Let's talk about that. So there's a lot of stuff like pay for lead generation. And that's expensive, but effective. If you know, if you know your numbers and you follow the numbers and you understand what specifically you need to go for. But you also have to have, you have to have the CRM. You have to have the systems ready for that stuff. Like you have the ability to get leads now, right? But you have to be able to track those things. And then you have to be able to financially make sure that it makes sense. I don't like to do anything that doesn't give me $3 back for every $1 that I spend. So when I go into these places and why do I say no to 97% of people, just because I can just go through the BS already. I just know that most like these people that just are selling me bad leads or whatever. But then when I get somebody on the hook, I can ask the right questions and most of them fall out because they don't have the answers. Ask the right questions. Understand what specifically you need to be looking for in the lead sources that are being offered to you to see if it's worth the investment. And then put it, do it, believe in yourself and give yourself a minimum of three, hopefully six months to start to see those ratios. Because that is about the buying timeline to be able to tell if the lead source is good or not. Another idea if you're just starting out, go to a team lead. The amount of help team leads need is immense. And what I will go to them is like, hey, listen, how many people are in your database? How many people are you not contacting? What is in your nurture and your spheres? Can I contact them for you and I'll give you a 25% referral fee that you can get them back? That is exactly the style of flow of the stuff that you need to do to be able to get after it. Real estate is a contact sport. Remember that. All right. The power of attitude. Guys, this is it. 70% of your success comes from attitude. 70% of success comes from your attitude. It's got nothing to do with activities, with actions and all of that. So what do you think you guys should be investing in every single day? It's your attitude. What makes you happy? What makes you feel good? I wake up every morning at 4.45. I work out. I stretch. I meditate. I get ready because my little gremlins wake up around 6.20 and they are ready to beat my ass. Sorry DJ, I got to swear. And I love it. I love it. My little girls, they just crush me and it's just why I am doing what I do. It's my why and they are my, I invest in my attitude that way because I come in and I have to have so much energy to be able to push every single day to stay on top of my game. And then you just do that every single day. Guys, it's the butterfly effect. You do something every single day. It will just start your day off. You have to come in because when you have a crap day and you did 97 calls and you're like, I can't do this anymore. Now when you were one phone call away from that successful call, you missed it because your head was down. The next call is always the opportunity that you might have. So you got to be able to work on that so you can push through and get it going. Here's the quote that I want to leave you guys with. Whether you think you can or you can't, you're probably right. Go Crush 2025. If you're in Chicago, I hope that I do a deal with you. Thank you so much for this opportunity. I love it. All right, let's give a round of applause. Everyone's muted, but we'll applaud for Greg and let him know in the notes. You know, again, attitude, right? We heard a lot about attitude and consistency. Greg, I've got a few questions for you. No. My first question and thank you. Please put your questions in the chat. We will do our best to either unmute you or we'll ask on your behalf, but we want to get your questions answered. But I have a question. So for sphere of influence leads, so they, you know, the people that are closest to you, if you're not purchasing leads or acquiring sort of cold leads, what might you suggest as a good consistent strategy to stay in touch with those people? So that when they do need you, they're not, you know, going with someone else. Yeah, so, you know, the center of influence are to me, the people that just want to hear from you, right? Like we're talking about people that like hearing from you or whatever. So I have a cadence of calling those people four times a year. So once a quarter. And it gets a little weird and it's like, hey, how's it going? What's going to, so I like, I also like to do two events a year. So that I can kind of like piggyback one call of how are you, another one, hey, come to my event, right? And you guys don't have to go crazy. Like you can just do something like a partner with the lender, do a happy hour, say, hey, I just want to see you do like a summer one and do out. So I mean, beginning of the year, just do something that is kind of like, you know, right there. And then it gives you a reason to phone call, right? So like that's what I do for my agents. I make it easy for them. But do like four touches a year, do some newsletters. And if they are, your center of influence, they'll come back to you. That's great. Another question from the chat was from Mike McElroy who said, what are the questions that turn you off to a lead source? Because we, look, we all get those emails and these cold emails from these lead companies that are like, well, they don't even say where they're from. Oftentimes you just get these these emails all day long. We all get them. How would you go about, you know, interviewing these people, making sure that they are actually can deliver? What's your proven closing ratio and give me two referrals of people that work with you and are successful? That will, that will knock out 98% of people. Closing ratio and a, give me a referral of two to three people that use you that can, that can abide by that closing ratio. It will knock out everybody. That's a great, great question. Travis asked, is there a reason you target $3 return on every $1 spent? Just it's what we found that's the most profitable like expectation without getting too crazy and something that is like worth your time because the amount of energy you need to spend to be able to close these online leads, it's got to be able to pay you back significantly. So you can't just be making like 20 cents, you know, additional from a dollar spend. You got to be able to like put that in because then you got to remember if you're waiting three to six months, you might not get your first check for six months and you're usually spending thousands of dollars. Right? So you'd be like, it's got to pay you back pretty, pretty well, pretty quickly. The other thing that you guys have to think about, there's a lot of referral programs out there as well, but you don't have to pay for upfront. There is, I don't Redfin has a really good partner program. I used to be in that. Obsidian. Obsidian, like, you know, you look for those like I would pay you for the referral and it's performance-based. Right? So it's something where are you fast on the phone? Are you available 24 7? Are you ready to lose your weekends? Do you hate evening like, hey, but are you able to work on your weekends? Those answers are yes, you'll beat up everybody else on those and you'll rank up the platform, but you just got to put in the work and you got to find those avenues of free leads that you just pay it on the back and with the referral sources. I have a question. How much harder and you know a lot of agents locally here as well as all over the country? How much harder do you think your agents work hour-wise? And I mean this in a very complimentary way because I think, you know, since there isn't much accountability in this business and you're sort of providing that structure, is that really the main secret to the success is just putting in more time? Um, the whole principle behind real estate, most people say, um, just work harder. I think that that is a lazy mindset. The true mindset is work smarter. So what we do is with our MMAs, my agents can complete their day within two to three hours. That's how focused their activities are, right? Like that is how what I want them to do because I want the rest of the time. Is to focus on themselves, go to stuff that you like. Mental health is a huge thing that we focus on here and best to prefer. And if you are very focused on your activities, you should be able to complete in your day within three, maybe four hours of focused activities if you know what you're doing. Right? But the availability, they have to be available 21st up. Right? So like, because phone calls come in any point in time, we have numerous from all these different sources. And it's first, first to lead, right? We have showing time tours. You have to answer the phone and automatically appoints a poor, you'll go to the next agent. So I think it's more about working smarter to be able to get more business and just the availability, the realistic availability, um, from let's call it 80m to 9pm Monday through Sunday, so that you're ready to answer the phone. You got to put in the work. You got to essentially dedicate two years of your life to do this. Two years of your life. If you're not ready to do that, do not get into leads. And what we're talking about is three to four hours of MMA money making activities a day. Yes. Yes. I love that. Now Patrick Browning asked at what point did you create your team? And was this because you didn't have the bandwidth for the amount of work required? Or were you just aggressively growing your business? Yeah. Perfect question. Um, I failed on three iterations of teams before this team. And before this team started, I looked at my business partners. I don't want to, I don't ever want a team again. Um, so the reason why we started this team is because it's not that, you know, we couldn't handle the bandwidth. It's that we didn't figure out the right model that would ultimately mesh with the way that we like to coach and guide and work, right? We are all about value at. We always give value to our agents, but very few agents are essentially able to take that run with it and execute consistently. So once we figured out this right model, right? And we actually, it wasn't, it was in the same time we got onto Flex. It was like, uh, this is a little bit too good to be true with the closing ratios, all that stuff. I put in the work. I closed six homes in the first month. I was like, whoa, dude, whoa. And Zillow was like, hey, listen, we're willing to grow this with you. Um, we can go, we can four or five extra lead flow. Are you able to do it? And I'm like, uh, yeah, give me a moment. And then I went out on this, what does the ideal agent profile look like to be able to do this? And that is what we've been working on to get the right people into the right positions. Because one of my agents performs it about three to four normal average agents, right? So it's, it's a matter of opportunity tied with a lot of failure tied with the understanding of what we needed to do. So I guess it was experience of failure to know where we were going and is kind of like everything just kind of happened all at once and, and that, that's where we're at now. Okay. Leah Hill asks, as someone who has not previously worked for Eddie brokerage, what advice do you have to stand out to brokerages with no experience or sales under your belt? Is sales something that would deter you from hiring or do you focus mainly on attitude and ethic? So you're, so the, so this agent is want to make sure they don't have any experience and they're trying to stand out for the brokers to get hired. I believe so. Leah, you can, the answer for you is your thinking of it in a completely wrong way. They brokerage better knock your socks off who work there. Okay. Too many brokers under value themselves and don't understand what a value you are to be able to go and put in the work and be consistent about it with a great attitude. The 3% of my hires, right? 3% of people are hired here because that is exclusively what I look for. Yes, it'd be good to have some experience or whatever, but if you are just this like ready to crush, you have an amazing attitude and you have this, I'm just going to do whatever it takes and I'm going to get there. You will outperform 90% of the industry coming here. You just will. So what you need to be looking for is you need to be looking for the right brokerage that can support your ambitions. Listen, we had a lot of people, most of my agents come from big brokerages, and it's not that they're bad, they're great at branding. Just when you get there, you're on an aisle. They don't offer you anything. So it's like you don't have leads. I mean, should they have some online coaching or whatever, but who in the office? You've got to go in there. Who's the most successful broker in the office that you're looking at? And you want to go there? And I would interview them. What are they support you? How has your business grown you? Right? When it comes to me and big brokerages come in and they try to recruit me or whatever, I'm like, why? What do you provide for me? I'm producing your entire team. What are you talking about? Like you want me to come to you so I give you more value? Get out of here. You need to be looking at yourself as the value asset and the brokerage is the piece that can help you get to where you're trying to get to. That's how you got to be thinking about it. A few quick questions left for Greg here. Boy, you're just getting more and more questions, which is amazing. Mike McElroy asks, do you have ISAs or do your agents make first contact with leads? Hi, baby. I love you. How are you, man? Good to see you. Happy New Year. The ISA model failed. The reason is because no one's going to ever talk to a lead better than you. We're playing around AI. The only reason is because we are going to mass volume sources like Facebook. The worst lead source in the world is Facebook. The reason that I'm going into them is because it's the cheapest. What I understand is that if I can get something cheap and if out of a thousand leads, I can close 10 deals and I can do it through AI, then it becomes very profitable for me and it all starts with knowing your numbers. ISAs were not good for the lead sources we were having. They weren't really doing that well for me. Maybe I had the wrong ISAs, maybe, I don't know. But what I learned, we took the ISA model away because I want my agents to talk to the people right away from the start. Valeria asks what platform to use for CRM. You mentioned that follow-up boss. We just pancored by the way. Coming from the last year, I can tell you, it's barren on amazing for real estate. Awesome. Nicole asks, do you find that paid referral sources to be better quality leads, leads to the close, then leads generated from open houses or hosting home buying webinars? In other words, leads from paid referral sources versus open houses or doing events. It depends, right? But I would say almost always, your efforts will breed better leads. It's just when you think about it, the harder it is to get the lead, probably the higher quality it is. Use that formula and it will probably guide you towards where you've got to be putting your efforts in. But do stuff that you like to do. Don't just do things to do them. If you're going to do the open house, make a metric behind it. Are you doing certain types of promotions that you're trying to get people in and then be like, all right, cool. How many open house buyers come in on average are on represented? How many of those unrepresented buyers can I get to close? Because then you can get really excited. It's cool. There's going to be another representative buyer. I know five of these I get a lead. Get yourself excited with your activities because you got to know your numbers. I know there are still some agents that are nervous about asking buyers for signing the agreement and possibly asking for direct payment. You said that didn't scare you. You guys figured out your pitch there. You said not only did it not make things worse, it actually made things better and your close ratio went up. Can you speak to that for a little bit? Yeah. It's changed everything for us. I felt it was going to be a massive competitive advantage for us. My God was I right. Here's why brokers don't know how to sell themselves. They don't know how to sell their value. There's a secondary type of pitch now. There used to be first and foremost a home consultation. That was the first. Guys, the first pitch now is a broker consultation. You see what I'm saying? We've created an entire pitch deck on why we are the right broker that they should be using and it's all value base. What are your four points that you offer that nobody else can compete with? For example, I went back and I looked at all of our closed sales that we then sold again and I figured out we make people on average $45,000 when they buy with us and then sell with us. I say that point and they're like, whoa, because you guys have to understand if somebody sees you as an asset, they're signing right away. They see you as an expense. You're done. You are nervous right now whoever asks that question because you see yourself as an expense. Start thinking yourself as an asset. They are lucky to be talking to you because of what is your value prop. Get good at that. Get good at 32nd pitch and then get good at a five minute presentation. You'll knock it out of the water. Last question from Tim Littleton. What advice do you have for a broker who has just moved to a new area and is just getting started in their real estate career? I mean, it depends on what you want to sell, right? If I was to start somewhere new, right? And I was kind of like to do my thing. I would figure out niche wise, right? Where and how there's an opportunity. And then I would look at see who are the best performing brokers in that specific niche. Like let's say you want to be the best at high-rise selling of the gold cost, right? Who is doing the best and how does this go? Call them. The best top-producing brokers, guys. They're the most open, honest, and willing to give because we understand the pie is so big. It's so big that like at the end of the day, what am I holding this close to my chest? I'm not nervous. I'm not worried. I want to share. I want to bring great brokers into this industry because there's too many people that think that would car salesmen. Nothing that gets car salesmen, I look car salesmen, but the idea of like a sleazy salesman or whatever and we got to get that out. So if you just are starting, you're coming into a new niche, a new market, kind of figure out where and how you want to focus and then just become the best at that and understand where those people, where those buyers are at and just start marketing to that. I mean, the other day I'm really good at online leads. You can place me anywhere and I'll start selling like that because I understand how and where to formulate. That's my niche. But like figure out what you like to do, where you want to be, who you can attract and then go go interview the best people in that niche and then just replicate their system, find out their MMAs. What do you do? What's the numbers? How many people do you got to call? People tell you, then you put it into a stat, like you put it into your equation, then you just backwards and then understand that if I need to call 10 people today, I'll get one lead. Fantastic. Go call those 10 people. Understand your numbers. But that 100% agree on asking for advice from already successful agents. This is how we book guests for how we initially we don't really ask guests anymore. They come to us more than we go to them. But when we first started, I thought no one's going to want to share their secrets and boy was I wrong because you probably don't see other agents as competition. Not guessing. Not. I love you guys. Instagram. Let's chat. Speaking of that, we will have all of Greg's social social links sent out to you. We were get that to you. Please follow him all over the place.
