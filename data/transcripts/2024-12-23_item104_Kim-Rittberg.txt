[00:02:21] Hello, Keeping It Real listeners. My name is Kim Rittburg. I'm a real estate video coach that
[00:02:26] means I help you get more confident on camera and figure out what to make for your business
[00:02:30] specifically to bring in clients. I'm not talking about being influencers and talking about
[00:02:34] establishing yourself as a go-to agent in your areas that you can make more money. Isn't that fun?
[00:02:39] It's fun to make more money, right? I came here via a very long media career. I worked at Netflix.
[00:02:46] I was the first ever video unit for a weekly magazine. I was a TV producer and writer in Fox
[00:02:54] in Inside Edition. So I merged journalism with video production skills, meaning it's not just
[00:03:01] about like holding up your camera and being well lit, but you're messaging underpins everything.
[00:03:06] So today I wanted to talk about AI. How you can use AI in your business, what you should do,
[00:03:10] and what you shouldn't do. This is the topic I spoke about at Fast Companies Innovation Festival in
[00:03:15] the fall. I get so many questions about it that I thought it would be really great to show with
[00:03:19] agents. I love the Keeping It Real community. Make sure to drop me a line on Instagram or LinkedIn
[00:03:26] at KimKIMRITTBERG and make sure to say that you're from Keeping It Real. I really wanted to focus
[00:03:32] on AI because it's something that everyone's talking about, but it's important to not just jump in
[00:03:37] and start using AI without really thinking about how AI can help you, but also how AI can hurt you.
[00:03:44] Before I get too far into this, I want to remind you that we have an amazing seminar coming up.
[00:03:49] Everything you need to know for 2025 to grow your business, it is going to be at Keeping It Real
[00:03:55] Webinar.com. I think that's right. Anyway, it'll be in the show notes and you can go to KimRitberg.com
[00:04:00] slash tips. I'll give you my free download 10 tips to grow your video and you can find me on Instagram
[00:04:06] or LinkedIn at KIMRITTBERG. I wanted to jump right into AI and the human touch. What's super
[00:04:15] important about AI is realizing that as a human, it's important to use AI artificial intelligence
[00:04:22] to highlight your human and emotional intelligence. To cut through what that means jargon-wise is
[00:04:30] look around. A lot of people are posting generic stuff online on social media. They're doing
[00:04:35] it because they feel like, oh, I have to feed this beast. I just create content and keep creating
[00:04:39] content. Step back and realize why you're creating content in the first place. We're creating content
[00:04:44] to remind people who we are, especially for agents who are talking about connecting with past clients
[00:04:49] and connecting with potential future clients, but refreshing those relationships. One of my agents
[00:04:54] David in New York said to me, oh my god, Kim, I got a message from someone I worked with five years
[00:04:59] ago. He really liked my Instagram posts and wanted to have lunch. From that lunch, he got brought in
[00:05:04] on a new development. We're talking about millions of dollars in home sales from re-cracking that
[00:05:11] relationship. So refreshing the relationship, rekindling an old relationship because you're online.
[00:05:18] So what does that mean? That means when you get a boring no offense, but a boring photo or whatever
[00:05:22] from your agency and you repost it, that's not really doing that much. It's not going to get a
[00:05:27] lot of engagement. It doesn't really remind people what they love about you. You really have to show
[00:05:31] up with your point of view and your perspective. I call it the two C's. Connection and credibility.
[00:05:36] Show up to connect with people, remind them who you are, your hobbies, your personal life,
[00:05:40] obviously your professional perspective, and put that credibility piece. Why people should trust
[00:05:45] you, show them that you're an expert, chillin, you have business deals, that you love what you do.
[00:05:51] So now stepping into AI, AI can help you with content. It can help you be more efficient,
[00:05:56] but you have to use it in a way that's highlighting your human side. If you're only using AI to just
[00:06:02] make more content, but you're not really pausing and thinking about how is it making you more human
[00:06:07] and more connected to waste of time and to waste of money. Instead of putting out, let's say,
[00:06:12] five pieces of AI content, put out three and do run it through this filter. So, number one,
[00:06:19] you have to run it through a filter. You have to define your brand first. So if you don't know what
[00:06:22] your brand is, meaning who do you talk to, what's special about you, that's something that you need
[00:06:26] to start with. So message me, I will discuss how you can figure out what your brand is, but you have
[00:06:31] to get a really strong hold of like what's special about you? What do you love? What's your driving
[00:06:37] passion? I have agents, some love design, some love financial stuff, others love negotiating,
[00:06:43] others love getting people into their first home. That's a differentiator. It doesn't mean you
[00:06:47] only have to serve those people, but it's a differentiator. It's a niche, it doesn't mean you can't
[00:06:52] escape that niche, but it will help you grow faster to identify that. Then when you get your brand,
[00:06:57] I want you to tell Chad G. B. G who you are. Don't just say I'm an agent in Chicago. Don't just say
[00:07:02] I'm an agent in Houston, Texas. You have to actually put in who you serve, what your area of
[00:07:07] expertise is, you could put in type of things that you've written, that's going to help it get you
[00:07:12] better content. So first you're going to put in, like so for example, I put in I am a video coach
[00:07:20] and public speaking coach who discusses video marketing and social media strategy. I write and
[00:07:26] speak in a professional but breezy tone of voice and my target audience is real estate agents,
[00:07:32] coaches, consultants and founders. That's all I'm going to tell Chad G. B. T for now, but it's way
[00:07:38] more than just saying I work in video. They're going to write something that's not in my voice.
[00:07:42] It's not going to seem like me if I read it or post it, it's going to feel totally off-brand.
[00:07:47] So, but if you do have even those three lines, you'll get pretty good stuff out of Chad G. B. T.
[00:07:54] Then you can ask for it to give you content ideas. So what I love about that is, and by the way,
[00:08:00] I have this in a free download, you can go to kimbritburg.com slash AI and I'm actually going to make
[00:08:04] sure to put this in the show notes. It's kimbritburg.com slash AI and then that's that has these
[00:08:11] tips written down and like a cute little PDF. But it is really, really important to understand how
[00:08:17] you're going to then leverage it into content. So AI is, can act as a great search engine and it can
[00:08:23] come with ideas for you quickly. So it's a huge boost for your business. You can get ideas for
[00:08:28] social media, podcasts, videos, blogs, newsletters, all of those things. Now that Chad G. B. T.
[00:08:34] knows who you are, right? We told it who we are. Now we can ask some questions. We could say,
[00:08:39] Chad G. B. T. Hey, come up with 10 post ideas based on my profession and my audience.
[00:08:45] You can say, what are top 25 questions my audience has about my area of expertise? That's something
[00:08:49] actually my client, Randy in New York City, he's like a really amazing real estate influencer,
[00:08:54] he Randy Baruch, shout out to him. He actually had this idea. He's like, ask them the top 25
[00:08:59] questions and answers that your audience has. So ask it that people would want to know and then
[00:09:04] get those questions. You can see what the answers they give are but always, always, always run it
[00:09:10] through your own filter. And now, now here's the filter. So you get the ideas from Chad G. B. T.
[00:09:17] You could say, write me a 60 second video script about this. You could say, write me a newsletter
[00:09:21] about this, but then you have to run it through this checklist. It's called the AI SAG S-A-G checklist.
[00:09:27] I call it that because if it's SAG, as it goes right on the floor, it's not good, it stinks.
[00:09:32] If it soars, it's amazing. SAG. S does it sound like me? So you're going to take that piece of
[00:09:38] content that idea that Chad G. B. T. gave you. Say, hmm, does it sound like me? Okay. All right, maybe.
[00:09:45] Hey, do I agree with it? Sometimes Chad G. B. T. will say something and you're like, I actually don't
[00:09:48] agree with that. Don't use that. If you don't agree with the idea, don't use it. And then G is it
[00:09:54] generic? Generic is bad. It's really, really good if it sounds like something you, only you would say
[00:10:00] and only you would know. So you want to say, does it sound like me? Do I agree with it? And is it
[00:10:04] generic? And based on that, you can post it. So I want to leave you there for now because I feel like
[00:10:12] AI, people get overwhelmed by it. But now I will have a test for you and I want you to do this and
[00:10:15] tag me on social media. I want you to just use Chad G. B. T. and just ask it for some content ideas.
[00:10:21] You don't even have to go far into write me a script. Just say, give me 10 content ideas. I am a
[00:10:27] real estate agent based in a Toso Oklahoma. Actually, I've never even worked with someone there. So
[00:10:33] that'd be cool. San Diego, California. Give me 10 ideas for my audience and then say, you know,
[00:10:39] give those 10 ideas. Let me know what you think of those ideas. I love hearing feedback from people.
[00:10:44] Tell me if it was great, if it was terrible, if it were perfectly, let me know. I'm on Instagram
[00:10:48] and LinkedIn at Kim Rittberg, R-I-T-T-B-E-R-G. And make sure to join our seminar, our webinar in January.
[00:10:55] It's going to be like the first week of January and we're back. It's going to be really fun. You're
[00:10:59] going to learn everything you need to know to crush 2025. And I love keeping you real. It's so great.
[00:11:04] Make sure to say hi to me on social media. You can grab my free tips. Just drop me a line and say
[00:11:09] that you're keeping it real. Listener, I'll drop it to you there. And until next time, I hope you're
[00:11:13] doing a great and wonderful day enjoying this holiday season. I'm wearing sequins today. So I'm
