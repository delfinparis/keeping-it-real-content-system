[00:01:15] And now, onto our show.
[00:01:30] Welcome back to part three of the buyer series Checklist.
[00:01:35] Again, this is what my group does.
[00:01:37] We love our checklist.
[00:01:39] We put everything in the checklist.
[00:01:40] So that way, we never forget anything.
[00:01:42] We can sleep easy at night and not wake up in the middle of the night thinking, oh my
[00:01:46] gosh, did I do this?
[00:01:47] No.
[00:01:47] We need to reference the checklist.
[00:01:49] Anything that you do more than twice should be part of a checklist.
[00:01:54] So welcome back.
[00:01:56] Allie Garcede, Allie the agent on all social media.
[00:01:59] If you have been enjoying this series so far, please go ahead and give DJ and Keeping It
[00:02:05] Real a Review, Five Star Review on whatever platform you're listening to this on.
[00:02:10] Whether it's YouTube or Apple or Spotify, please go ahead and do that.
[00:02:14] DJ does a lot for bettering this industry and I love that.
[00:02:18] So if you are catching this on part three and you have not yet watched part one or part
[00:02:24] two, I advise that you go to part one and you watch that on YouTube as opposed to listening
[00:02:30] to it because as much as I'm trying to vocalize exactly what I'm doing, it's better if you
[00:02:35] follow along on the computer and can see and create your own checklist.
[00:02:40] If you don't want to ask me for the checklist here, you can create your own checklist just
[00:02:45] following along because I'm sharing my screen on everything.
[00:02:48] So otherwise, if you want the copy of my checklist, I am giving these away for free.
[00:02:51] Just meet with me first.
[00:02:53] Text 520-341-2552 or if you just find me on social media, again, that's Allie the agent.
[00:02:59] I have been meeting with a couple of you and it's so nice that just being able to share
[00:03:04] the checklist and help other agents out.
[00:03:05] I love it.
[00:03:06] I'm here for this.
[00:03:06] So, text me.
[00:03:09] I've got a lot of reach outs.
[00:03:10] I'm here for you.
[00:03:12] So let's get started on the Trello checklist where I left off at the end of part two of
[00:03:20] this series was the inspection period and the appraisal period.
[00:03:26] So assuming that the appraisal comes back and you know buyer and seller agree or it comes
[00:03:30] back right at the purchase price, excellent.
[00:03:32] The next step is the next section rather is the before closing checklist.
[00:03:39] So first item on this checklist is to email clients the before closing checklist, aka buyer
[00:03:45] email number 5.
[00:03:47] And again, when you meet with me, you get all these emails as well.
[00:03:51] So what does buyer email number 5 say?
[00:03:53] Well, what a good question.
[00:03:54] I'm so glad you asked.
[00:03:56] Okay.
[00:03:57] The first thing again on every single one of my emails is a video.
[00:04:00] So, so few people do this.
[00:04:03] Again, people, this is not only another touch that a lot of other REALTORS aren't doing,
[00:04:08] it's a one time video that you create for all of your clients and they get to see you and
[00:04:15] hear you again and you know, it's almost as if you're right there with them telling them,
[00:04:19] hey, these are the next steps.
[00:04:20] So what does this three minute video say?
[00:04:23] I pretty much just relay everything of what's already in the body of the email and the
[00:04:29] text.
[00:04:30] Because again, if I were to just send this portion here, if you're looking along, it's
[00:04:33] just words and it's so lengthy and it's so boring.
[00:04:36] Who wants to read this?
[00:04:38] Even I don't want to read it.
[00:04:39] So therefore, even though I made it, you know, bullet format, you know, no paragraphs
[00:04:44] or few paragraphs, it's boring.
[00:04:47] So make it as easy for them as possible to follow along.
[00:04:50] Boom.
[00:04:50] They can click on this.
[00:04:51] It goes straight to my bomb bomb, which I pay for 23 bucks a month for the unlimited.
[00:04:56] I highly suggest you do the same.
[00:04:57] You can also do loom as well.
[00:05:00] So the next steps, what does this, what does the text of buyer email number five say?
[00:05:06] It says number one, transfer all your utilities over to your personal name and your credit card,
[00:05:12] your checking account starting at the closing date in Arizona, the date of closing or
[00:05:18] close of escrow belongs to the buyer.
[00:05:20] It could be different in your state.
[00:05:21] Definitely check with your team lead, your broker, your, you know, your state leaders.
[00:05:26] Also along with what so essentially what does the utilities entail?
[00:05:30] The water sewer trash, the electric, the gas, etc.
[00:05:35] You also want to make sure that the solar lease or the solar loan, if that applies in this case,
[00:05:40] is transferred over.
[00:05:42] So in that way, the seller doesn't have that anymore.
[00:05:45] And the buyer can take over the loan or the lease, whatever may apply.
[00:05:50] Number two, so important schedule a locksmith to change the locks on your property,
[00:05:56] the day of closing once you record.
[00:06:00] So again, it depends on, you know, it might be different in other states.
[00:06:04] So so definitely check with your broker.
[00:06:06] I have had a personal scare with this where my second closing ever, I was representing buyers
[00:06:13] and they purchased a house from a bigger company and it about two days later, they had not yet
[00:06:20] scheduled the lock, the locks to be changed.
[00:06:24] And around midnight, this big company goes into their house, barges into their house and
[00:06:31] tries to get them to move out of the house, claiming that they were squatters.
[00:06:37] It was a whole thing.
[00:06:38] They said that there are no emergencies in real estate.
[00:06:40] That was actually an emergency.
[00:06:43] That was so scary.
[00:06:46] So even if you have never had any bad issues with this, please use my example to tell your
[00:06:53] buyers the importance of changing the locks as soon as the property records or as soon
[00:06:59] as you can in your state.
[00:07:01] Number three, of course, schedule internet and cable because internet, at least in my
[00:07:05] area, takes a long time to schedule.
[00:07:07] So you want to make sure that they are ahead of the game.
[00:07:09] The earlier they can do that, the better.
[00:07:11] Again, this goes out about a week before closing, so it gives them enough time.
[00:07:17] And any other subscriptions or people that they'll need.
[00:07:22] For example, if they have a pool, schedule the pool company, schedule the pest, the weeds,
[00:07:29] you know, I'm trying to think of other things, but that's all pretty much that we have here.
[00:07:34] And what happens as you scroll down in this email, then I say, it's been great working
[00:07:39] with you.
[00:07:40] I've loved helping you through this home purchasing journey.
[00:07:42] Again, I repeat that also in the video as well.
[00:07:45] And the bottom of this email, I say, can I ask you for a favor?
[00:07:49] Do you know of anyone else that's looking to buy or to sell?
[00:07:52] And this can be in any state, not just in, you know, enter your city and state because
[00:07:57] from there, you can get referrals.
[00:07:59] And I've gotten referrals this way.
[00:08:00] It's been great actually, not from this email, but from me doing this also in a text.
[00:08:06] And I'll explain more of that in a bit.
[00:08:08] And if they do have someone, you know, can you start a group chat and introduce me to
[00:08:12] them?
[00:08:13] Instead of them passing on your phone number, what you want is for them to start a group
[00:08:20] chat with that potential buyer, with that potential seller, with you on it.
[00:08:23] That way it's a warm handoff and it's a better conversion rate after that.
[00:08:28] And then I explain what referrals mean because a lot of people don't realize, don't really
[00:08:33] know what that means.
[00:08:34] You know, my business runs off referrals.
[00:08:36] Clients don't know what that means, especially if they've never been in a business owner.
[00:08:42] So I explain that to them.
[00:08:44] So, boom, I send buyer email number five to the all buyer parties and heading back to this
[00:08:51] Trello checklist now.
[00:08:53] Then I ask them to write a review.
[00:08:56] Again, this is about a week before closing check the checklist there.
[00:09:00] So sometimes buyers aren't comfortable yet.
[00:09:02] They want to make sure that they close.
[00:09:03] That's totally fine too.
[00:09:04] I do reiterate to them that the review is just based off of me as a person so far in their
[00:09:10] experience.
[00:09:11] So they don't have to wait until closing.
[00:09:12] But if they prefer to wait until closing, totally fine.
[00:09:15] I'm here for it.
[00:09:15] Thank you so much.
[00:09:16] So of course, Zilla was once you actually have a closings, but Google doesn't have to
[00:09:21] be.
[00:09:22] So you can ask for several reviews from the same clients throughout the process.
[00:09:27] And that's exactly what's next after that is to do it on all of the review platforms.
[00:09:34] Google, Zilla, REALTOR, Facebook Business Page, if you have that YouTube, whatever it
[00:09:40] might be.
[00:09:41] After that, complete the final walkthrough with the buyer or if the final walkthrough waiver
[00:09:47] applies, then make sure that all the party sign and it's sent over to the brokers for
[00:09:52] the review.
[00:09:54] If you're at the final walkthrough, take the keys out of the super box and put them in
[00:09:59] a general contractor lock box because sometimes, you know, listing agents, of course, coordinate
[00:10:04] with the listing agent.
[00:10:05] They'll want to use that super box and, you know, immediately push it on to the next
[00:10:10] listing that they have.
[00:10:11] So definitely don't want to keep your keep the keys in there and you definitely want to
[00:10:15] confirm with the listing agent that it's okay that you remove those keys.
[00:10:19] So of course, just talk to them and figure out a spot to where the keys are safe and not
[00:10:25] yet in the buyer's control before, you know, recording, never do that.
[00:10:30] So just over communicate with the listing agent and work something out there.
[00:10:35] Then tell the clients to schedule the locksmith to be done after closing or to the closing
[00:10:42] gift.
[00:10:42] I just started on with client giant and I love it.
[00:10:48] I personally am so bad at thinking of closing gifts.
[00:10:50] Oh, it is so rough.
[00:10:53] I, it's just a blank sheet of paper when I think of what to give a client for closing.
[00:10:58] So I send up for client giant.
[00:10:59] I'm liking it so far.
[00:11:00] It's actually a pretty good price.
[00:11:02] Like for example, VIP clients are like a hundred bucks for the year for gifts a year.
[00:11:06] So that's 25 bucks and I don't have to think about it.
[00:11:09] Yes, please.
[00:11:10] So reach out to them in case you also are like me and are a terrible gift giver.
[00:11:17] Otherwise if you already have clients, client gifts, you know, that you already know
[00:11:22] what to do.
[00:11:23] I have made the mistake of ordering them too early like before appraisal because I wanted
[00:11:28] it to be done on time and I wanted to give it to the client right at closing like when
[00:11:33] they're signing or when we meet at the house and I give them the keys.
[00:11:37] But as you know, 25% of all contracts fall out of S-row.
[00:11:42] So sometimes you're left holding the bag and sometimes you'll give it to them anyway.
[00:11:46] It's kind of awkward, you know, whatever.
[00:11:48] So you want to make sure that all the contingencies are removed before you order a gift.
[00:11:53] Learn from my mistakes, please.
[00:11:56] So then again, at the bottom here as we continue scrolling through the checklist, just confirm
[00:12:01] that the clients and the spouses or even adult kids that you've received a review on whatever
[00:12:09] platforms you're looking for.
[00:12:11] Again, with Google, it could be character.
[00:12:13] So hey, Allie was a funny REALTOR.
[00:12:15] That counts.
[00:12:16] You know, whatever it might be, it helps.
[00:12:19] So you definitely want to, you definitely want to increase your Google presence because
[00:12:23] Google is the number one website in the world followed by YouTube, which is the number
[00:12:27] two Google owns YouTube.
[00:12:29] You need to be on both.
[00:12:30] So if anything, focus on Google reviews with your Google business page and YouTube.
[00:12:37] But I have a whole whole bunch of other videos on YouTube.
[00:12:40] I'm definitely increasing my presence there.
[00:12:43] So day of closing.
[00:12:45] If the sellers are in town, oops, I meant to say if the buyers are in town.
[00:12:50] If the buy, let me fix this right here.
[00:12:51] If the buyers are in town, because this is the buyer checklist, they're in coordinate
[00:12:55] with them.
[00:12:55] Go to the closing, go to the signing.
[00:12:57] Make sure that title tells you when the signing is.
[00:13:01] Sometimes there's a lot of lost communication there.
[00:13:03] So you have to stay on title to make sure that they tell you when the closing is.
[00:13:08] Ask me how I know.
[00:13:10] Bring your soul key or any sort of additional, you know, something that you want in social
[00:13:16] media for the clients to post on their pages, as well as you to post on yours and your
[00:13:21] website.
[00:13:21] If the buyers are out of town, then go ahead and congratulate them, call them, send the
[00:13:28] FaceTime them, group phone calls are what people like.
[00:13:31] So definitely anytime you have good news, call them.
[00:13:35] Don't waste it on a text.
[00:13:37] So it's like people love hearing good news.
[00:13:41] Then if buyers, again, being that I work with mainly military, a lot of, well, all military
[00:13:47] have access to base.
[00:13:49] And a lot of times the title companies will wave the notary fee because the buyers or the
[00:13:56] sellers, whatever military clients that you have, have access to the base and they can
[00:14:01] avoid paying that $200 mobile notary fee.
[00:14:05] And they said they could just go to base and sign there.
[00:14:08] This helps a lot when your clients are coming out from out of country, say they're stationed
[00:14:13] in Japan or Korea right now, they can go on base there, have the closing documents
[00:14:21] faxed over to the legal base on there.
[00:14:23] They coordinate with legal and they can sign there and then fax it back.
[00:14:28] It saves them $200.
[00:14:29] There's no buyers will have to go anywhere to travel.
[00:14:33] It's super, super easy.
[00:14:35] I really like that a lot.
[00:14:37] But of course, if they don't have access or if they're not military, then you can just
[00:14:40] disregard that checklist.
[00:14:43] Or that check.
[00:14:44] Then next title is going to be asking you for the information that's needed to get you
[00:14:50] paid, of course, very important.
[00:14:53] So this goes specifically more into eXp stuff where we have sky slope and it tells you what
[00:14:59] buttons to click here to make sure that you get paid.
[00:15:01] Again, if you're in a different brokerage, then ask other agents around you how to make
[00:15:07] sure.
[00:15:08] And then right before closing, call the buyers again with the news saying, hey, so far,
[00:15:12] so good.
[00:15:13] Just wanted to say that we are on track.
[00:15:15] Do you have any questions?
[00:15:17] And then ask this is a perfect opportunity to ask from referrals.
[00:15:21] So do you know of anyone else that's looking to buy right now or do you know if anyone
[00:15:26] wants looking to sell?
[00:15:28] And then usually, again, because a lot of clients don't know how our business works or what
[00:15:35] referrals even mean, they're usually like, no, I'm the only one I know moving to Aurora
[00:15:41] Colorado.
[00:15:42] And that's when you can say, I actually can work in any state.
[00:15:45] I can do know of anyone else in looking to move in any state.
[00:15:49] I would love to help them find an agent that's right for their needs.
[00:15:53] And usually at that point, you know, what's the most common response is, no, I don't.
[00:15:58] And then I find that that's a great opportunity for you to really drill in to what to activate
[00:16:04] their memory.
[00:16:06] Specific examples.
[00:16:07] Usually what I find is when people are looking to buy or sell is any life changes.
[00:16:13] Like maybe someone you know that my that is pregnant now looking to maybe increase and
[00:16:18] you know upgrade their house or maybe some parents who's like kids just went away for
[00:16:22] college that might be looking to downsize into something smaller.
[00:16:25] Do you know of anybody like that or maybe somebody that got a job promotion and then just
[00:16:29] stay silent for a little bit and see, give them the opportunity to think about it.
[00:16:34] They might they might have somebody.
[00:16:36] And if they do again tell them this is the perfect time to train your clients.
[00:16:41] If you do or when you do instead of you passing on my phone number, I would love if you
[00:16:47] do me a huge favor and instead of just passing my phone number, if you could introduce me
[00:16:51] in a group chat, that would be that would mean a lot to me.
[00:16:55] And they're usually like, oh yeah, too easy.
[00:16:56] Yeah, I'll introduce you to my friend whenever I find of someone, find out about somebody
[00:17:01] moving and that usually increases the conversion rate by a lot.
[00:17:07] So then the last section here on this before closing checklist is clearly a lesson learned
[00:17:14] for me.
[00:17:15] So I added it on here.
[00:17:16] Make sure that the lead base disclosure has been signed by the buyer and that they're
[00:17:21] given the pamphlet.
[00:17:22] This almost became a quote.
[00:17:24] This was a close call for us.
[00:17:25] So if they don't have an ass here, TC to do it immediately because the fine is big and
[00:17:31] you'll be the one paying for it.
[00:17:32] So that's another foolproof measure to make sure that all of your paperwork is good to
[00:17:37] go.
[00:17:38] Then we have the after closing checklist and what's the first thing here, buyer email number
[00:17:45] six, which essentially is asking for a review.
[00:17:49] Again, in case they haven't yet reviewed, reviewed you.
[00:17:52] So let's take you over to buyer email number six.
[00:17:57] Buyer email number six here, subject line, can you leave me a review?
[00:18:00] And here I say there are thousands of real tours in X City and you chose to work with me.
[00:18:05] For that, I am so, so thankful.
[00:18:07] Can you let me know what I could have done to make it an even better experience?
[00:18:11] And what do I have for that?
[00:18:12] Of course, a video.
[00:18:14] It's two minutes long.
[00:18:15] It describes everything on here that I'm asking for a review and then I'm thanking them
[00:18:19] for the opportunity that they gave me to work with them.
[00:18:22] So and here again, after we meet together and you get these checklists, you'll be, you'll
[00:18:29] see what the video exactly says.
[00:18:33] After that, scrolling down the email here, can you make a video review of how I helped
[00:18:38] you?
[00:18:39] This I usually do also when I'm on the phone with them.
[00:18:42] And when I'm giving the keys, that's the perfect opportunity to take, to snap a quick
[00:18:49] video.
[00:18:50] It doesn't have to be long, 30 seconds.
[00:18:52] And the only thing that I ask them to do, I'm like, hey, would you mind if I take a quick
[00:18:56] video of you?
[00:18:57] And they're usually like, yeah, of course, you know, they're excited.
[00:19:00] You just help them buy a house.
[00:19:01] And they're like, yeah, cool.
[00:19:03] Of course, sometimes they're nervous, but that's natural.
[00:19:05] Not everyone is okay in front of a camera.
[00:19:08] So the highest level of testimonials are videos.
[00:19:13] So if you can get that, you know, the more you can get that and add that to your website,
[00:19:17] to your Google business page, the more you're going to rank.
[00:19:22] So definitely ask them.
[00:19:24] And you can, it doesn't have to be long.
[00:19:26] The only question they really have to ask or answer is, what was it like working with
[00:19:31] Allie?
[00:19:31] So they can start the sentence off that way.
[00:19:33] Working with Allie was and then just let them say whatever they want to say.
[00:19:38] And then, you know, the longer the better, of course.
[00:19:41] But anyway, I'm trilling off a little bit here.
[00:19:43] So back to buyer email number six.
[00:19:44] This is where I asked them for a video review.
[00:19:48] And I also asked them to start off the written review with the following, like IPCS to Davis
[00:19:57] Month and Air Force Base with an Allie Gar said, help me buy or sell home in XYZ City.
[00:20:04] And working with Allie was blank.
[00:20:06] I have this because these are key words.
[00:20:10] Again, SEO is so, so important when it comes to getting reviews and getting ranked
[00:20:14] and therefore getting more clients, clients reaching out to you.
[00:20:17] So being that my meat and potatoes are working with military clients, I want the key words
[00:20:22] PCS.
[00:20:23] I want the key word Davis Month and Air Force Base.
[00:20:26] Of course, you're also going to want to have your name and city.
[00:20:30] Those having those key words will rank you.
[00:20:33] So, you know, for example, say you live in, you know, I don't know, I don't know.
[00:20:37] Any other city, just plug and play this exact beginning into your buyer email number six.
[00:20:45] And I also give some examples too.
[00:20:48] Some examples if you were a buyer, how long did we work together that will show other
[00:20:53] people how patient I am?
[00:20:55] What type of loan did you have?
[00:20:57] Because the more that they can share that, the more other people reading those reviews
[00:21:01] will say, oh man, I also have an FHA loan.
[00:21:04] Great.
[00:21:04] It looks like she's done this before and maybe I want to work with her.
[00:21:08] Then the next is if you were remote during the home buying process, if my team helped you
[00:21:13] with like during FaceTime or sending you videos of the properties from afar, this is what
[00:21:17] we do for 90% of our clients.
[00:21:20] Majority of them have not been in Tucson even until after closing.
[00:21:25] So and then negotiations, how the negotiations work, how much under did we get the property?
[00:21:32] How much did you already have an instant equity because of our negotiation skills that
[00:21:37] you were able to close with and immediately grow your network?
[00:21:41] How many other offers were on the table and when the sellers chose your offer?
[00:21:46] And if there weren't any, how far under was the original list price to what we were able
[00:21:50] to get it under contract for?
[00:21:52] And was my team helpful in providing guidance?
[00:21:54] These are just some examples of what they can or of course they don't have to use these,
[00:21:59] but I'm using these to trigger their memory from the very very beginning of when we met
[00:22:03] all of the good times that we shared.
[00:22:07] And then of course I have the link to the Zillow and Google.
[00:22:13] I also have an example of a previous buyer review.
[00:22:19] So this, so go through your buyer reviews, find the one that you like the best, find
[00:22:24] like the one that just stands out and put that review in your template for this email.
[00:22:30] So in that way, other buyers can start to subliminally see, oh, this is like what she expects.
[00:22:34] This is going to be, okay, I really beefy, you know, testimonial, a really beefy review.
[00:22:42] So I do that.
[00:22:43] And then also at the bottom here, my business runs are referrals, meaning I rely on your
[00:22:47] word of mouth and telling other buyers and sellers to continue making a living.
[00:22:52] This is what I do to make a living.
[00:22:53] So if you know of anywhere of anyone moving anywhere in any state, please connect me.
[00:22:59] I can connect them to a few real tours that will help them every step of the way.
[00:23:03] Thank you so much.
[00:23:03] And then we'll sign a tour block, boom, and then I send it.
[00:23:07] Now that is buyer email number six, and that is the last of the official emails within
[00:23:12] the buyer process, but we're not done with the checklist.
[00:23:15] So after that, of course, you get the keys from seller.
[00:23:20] And if it's an I buyer, make sure, or pretty much if it has like a programming, if it has a,
[00:23:27] if the house has a keypad, you want to make sure that you have the instructions on how
[00:23:32] to erase all of the old codes and reprogram it, or maybe just buy a whole new one in case
[00:23:39] you don't have that.
[00:23:42] Again, changing your changing keys, as you know, it's not a cheap at all.
[00:23:51] Locksmiths make pretty good money.
[00:23:53] So make sure that your buyers know about how much to expect to change out all the locks.
[00:23:57] Then in bold here, in all of my checklist on my Trello, anything in bold is what I
[00:24:02] have my assistant do.
[00:24:03] So the assistant will add the client photo, the client testimonial to my website, to social
[00:24:08] media, and to post.
[00:24:10] This is also a great way on specifically on Instagram for you to invite the client as
[00:24:16] a collaborator, because that way it's that same post and it not only shows up in front of
[00:24:21] your audience, but now you're showing up in front of their audience.
[00:24:25] Even if their audience is a hundred people, it doesn't matter how few of their followers
[00:24:30] are, you get in front of a whole new audience.
[00:24:33] So now their friends can say, oh my gosh, wow, Ashley could close with Ali.
[00:24:38] Who is this Ali person?
[00:24:40] They're showing up on my feed because I'm friends with client Ashley, but REALTOR Ali seems
[00:24:46] pretty cool.
[00:24:46] Maybe I'll follow her.
[00:24:47] Maybe it'll become a relationship later on.
[00:24:52] And then add them to Homebot in case you're using Homebot.
[00:24:55] Homebot also was a group.
[00:24:57] It's a great way to get an inside scoop on if your clients are looking into the valuation
[00:25:04] of their home.
[00:25:06] How reliant they are with accurate information.
[00:25:08] That's another story.
[00:25:09] It might be really good in your area.
[00:25:11] It might not.
[00:25:12] A lot of lenders do pay for this already because it's a great way for them to see if the buyers
[00:25:19] want to refinance.
[00:25:21] So they're always keeping an eye on this.
[00:25:22] So reach out to a couple of lenders and see if they already have Homebot.
[00:25:26] They usually have, I think, between 8 to 10 slots available for them to give two agents.
[00:25:30] So reach out.
[00:25:32] And then one day after that, I reconfirmed that the clients have reviewed me on all the
[00:25:37] platforms.
[00:25:38] And it's a lot of platforms, right?
[00:25:40] Like you want to be everywhere.
[00:25:41] So to make this as simple as possible, I tell them, hey, I know it's a lot, but you only
[00:25:45] have to put effort into one review and then you can just copy and paste into everything
[00:25:49] else.
[00:25:50] And I want to catch that early.
[00:25:52] I do it one day after just to make sure.
[00:25:54] Because otherwise, if I'm doing it, you know, two months later, when I remember later on
[00:25:59] down the road, they're not going to want to do it.
[00:26:01] The honeymoon phase is over.
[00:26:03] They're high from purchasing a house is gone.
[00:26:06] So catch it early.
[00:26:08] And then of course find out, find out the status of the closing gift in case you're using
[00:26:13] client giant or anything else like that.
[00:26:15] Make sure that that's being worked on.
[00:26:18] And again, the next two items are ways to or reminders to review the other, the cross agent.
[00:26:27] Of course, if they're good, I'm not a fan of leaving bad reviews.
[00:26:32] But so if the cross agent was exceptional, you liked working with them and you truly
[00:26:37] want to work with them again, write them a business review on Google, help their business
[00:26:41] out because it's such a small world and the amount of agents that help other agents
[00:26:46] is very small.
[00:26:48] I'm finding.
[00:26:48] So anything that we can do to help each other out, it will come back to you.
[00:26:52] You know, like, so leave them a review.
[00:26:54] Like, and this is what I have an example here.
[00:26:56] I'm another agent in this same marketplace.
[00:27:00] But if, but this message is to every other agent, if you ever have a chance to work with
[00:27:05] the Sydney, you're considered yourself lucky.
[00:27:08] They know what they're doing for their client.
[00:27:10] We help them close or we work together on XYZ transaction like from Ali Gar said,
[00:27:15] REALTOR, blah, blah, blah.
[00:27:17] That helps them out so much.
[00:27:19] And guess what?
[00:27:19] Next time they have a listing and you're the buyer, guess who they're going to want to
[00:27:23] work with?
[00:27:24] You.
[00:27:25] So.
[00:27:26] And then the same thing here right at the bottom after this is invite them to any sort
[00:27:31] of annual parties events or really any event.
[00:27:34] Just keep that relationship going.
[00:27:37] I also have inside this bullet here is to let them know that it's not a recruiting event.
[00:27:43] Again, I work with eXp.
[00:27:45] So therefore, we have to like explain ourselves like, no, we're actually here to work.
[00:27:50] Like we're not here to recruit.
[00:27:53] So yeah, so I have that in the script here in case you are eXp.
[00:27:58] Like I mentioned before, I think if it was in my first video with this one or my my interview
[00:28:04] with DJ, but whenever I call an agent from a different brokerage, I literally have to
[00:28:09] say, hey, it's Ali Gar said, I'm a local REALTOR here with eXp Realty.
[00:28:13] Don't worry, I'm not trying to recruit you.
[00:28:16] And then I leave a little bit of a pause because they're usually like, oh, they laugh or
[00:28:20] they're like, oh, thank goodness.
[00:28:21] You know, I've already gone 10, 15 calls a day.
[00:28:23] And I'm like, no, I'm actually representing a buyer and we're interested in one to three
[00:28:26] main street.
[00:28:27] You know, when can I view it?
[00:28:29] So I definitely, in other eXp agents, no, they definitely have to like be on the defense
[00:28:34] like, hey, no, we're not trying to recruit.
[00:28:35] We're just trying to be friends.
[00:28:38] Okay, anyway, carrying on.
[00:28:40] Then after you add all the photos and the videos taken with the client at the closing
[00:28:44] or presenting the closing gift or at their house, put it in your Google business page.
[00:28:50] Anything you can do at least once a week to ramp up your Google business page, do it.
[00:28:55] Especially if they leave a video testimonial, ooh, that is perfect.
[00:29:00] They're on your on your YouTube, they're on your business page and watch yourself rank
[00:29:05] on page one.
[00:29:08] So also, if in case you want to do this, I know this is like a whole nother thing on its
[00:29:13] own, but you can also add that address of the property to a Google page that you own sites.google.com.
[00:29:21] You can create a website there and where you can have like a lot of different pin points
[00:29:27] of, hey, these are all the homes that I sold.
[00:29:28] So in case you ever need to prove yourself pretty much to a buyer or a seller, you can
[00:29:35] say, hey, these are all the homes that I've sold in the last or ever.
[00:29:40] Zillow does this too, but sometimes I feel like they don't capture everything.
[00:29:44] So this is a good way for you to pinpoint and show buyers or sellers in your listing
[00:29:49] presentation or your buyer consultation.
[00:29:53] Then the next section that we have here is following up one month after closing.
[00:29:58] I have realized that a lot of agents are scared to reach out to their clients because as you
[00:30:03] know, as I know, something always breaks, right?
[00:30:07] Especially if it's a first time home buyer, something is going to break within the first
[00:30:10] three months.
[00:30:11] It's just inevitable.
[00:30:14] So therefore a lot of agents are scared to make that call and they're like, oh my gosh,
[00:30:18] I know that that like, you know, maybe the AC is a little bit older or, you know, something.
[00:30:23] They're scared of actually following up and saying, hey, is everything going okay?
[00:30:29] But the clients want that.
[00:30:31] The clients need that from you.
[00:30:33] Instead, what a lot of agents do is close, you know, they post their stuff on social media,
[00:30:38] and then they call it a day, they boom, they disappear.
[00:30:41] Right when that client might actually need them the most, like, oh my gosh, my water heater just
[00:30:46] broke or, you know, something they need a contractor, they need a, they need an introduction
[00:30:51] to somebody that you know, but you didn't ask them.
[00:30:54] Sometimes the clients don't feel comfortable reaching out to you.
[00:30:57] They might think you're too busy.
[00:30:58] They might think you're, that's not your, you know, scope of work anymore.
[00:31:02] And although legally, it's not.
[00:31:04] It's a way to even further develop that relationship.
[00:31:08] So one month after closing or, you know, even one week out, but definitely one month,
[00:31:12] one after as well, reach out to them saying, hey, how are things going with their home?
[00:31:17] Like, honestly, how are things going?
[00:31:19] And let them tell you they might say, oh my gosh, we freaking love it.
[00:31:23] I, you know, that's it.
[00:31:25] Like all butterflies and roses or they might say actually the roof caved in, you know,
[00:31:31] something like Roborse case scenario, you can connect them to a real estate attorney or a
[00:31:38] contractor or a landscaping person because their weeds are now out of control.
[00:31:42] Whatever it is, just be a resource for them.
[00:31:44] They want that from you.
[00:31:46] And that's another perfect opportunity to see if they are looking, if they know of anybody yet,
[00:31:51] if they ever found remembered somebody that had a job promotion, etc, etc for a referral.
[00:31:58] And then after that, about five months after closing, that's when I mail out the six month gift.
[00:32:05] Like happy six months of being in your home.
[00:32:08] I, we mail them a candle, small candle, branded and a card.
[00:32:14] And then about 11 months after right before their one year home of her three,
[00:32:18] we mail them a bottle of wine.
[00:32:20] Of course, if they don't drink, we mail them something else with our logo and a card as well.
[00:32:25] A lot of times people will keep this card, especially if you got them a killer deal like,
[00:32:30] hey, I'm so, I'm so happy that we work together and you are able to increase your net worth by
[00:32:35] $17,000 just by closing on this house.
[00:32:39] That is something that they will keep on their fridge for a long time.
[00:32:44] And whenever they have guests over, they're going to say, oh my gosh, wow, you made $17,000.
[00:32:49] You added that to your net worth by purchasing this house.
[00:32:53] And whose name are they going to read at the bottom there?
[00:32:55] Allie the agent.
[00:32:57] So don't, don't sleep on, on cards.
[00:32:59] They're, they're amazing.
[00:33:01] And then every three months, again, if you have access to that home bot, you can log in, see if they,
[00:33:06] see if they've logged in at all, they may, they may, they may have not, they may have not, they may,
[00:33:11] have not, why does that sound weird?
[00:33:13] Anyway, carrying on, sending holiday cards around the holidays, always good to do, again,
[00:33:20] staying in touch with them and sending birthday cards to the buyer or if they're also married,
[00:33:28] the spouses, the kids, whichever, you know, the best way that you, that you increase your relationship
[00:33:34] with them. So just stay top of mind and do it genuinely.
[00:33:39] So if you're, you know, driving by the area or maybe even if you're not, say, hey, I,
[00:33:45] call them. I was just thinking about you. Hope you're having a great day. And that's it.
[00:33:50] Again, people like positive phone calls. You, you don't want to correlate your phone calls to
[00:33:55] mean bad news, which side note is what a lot of property managers do. So it's nice to flip that
[00:34:02] on its head. Then keep sending the review me email that buyer email number six for the reviews.
[00:34:09] If they haven't already done it and asked for a video review, just in case they haven't done it yet.
[00:34:14] And when they do review, actually respond. Google sees if you're responding to your Google reviews.
[00:34:20] And the way that you respond is everything. So make sure that you're professional, make sure that
[00:34:24] you're, you know, whatever your brand is. If you're funny, if you're loud, if you're sarcastic,
[00:34:28] whatever it is, respond to the review. And when they do review, blast it on, on all of your social
[00:34:35] media on your Instagram, your TikTok, your YouTube, your website everywhere. And every year, send a
[00:34:43] CMA. I would probably actually even do this month six. So month six. And then probably every year
[00:34:49] after that send a CMA, again, another touch point to stay in front of them because you never know,
[00:34:55] you never know when they might be looking to sell, when they might be looking to purchase another
[00:35:01] property. So they could refinance or, you know, pull money out of that one, purchase another one,
[00:35:06] you want them to become forever clients. And this is something that I learned from the Tom Ferry
[00:35:12] summit that I went to a couple of months ago that I'm recording this right now in 2023. They said
[00:35:17] to stop calling these clients past clients eliminate the term past clients from your vocabulary.
[00:35:23] They should be forever clients, just like you should be there forever REALTOR. So that doesn't
[00:35:30] mean one transaction and they never hear from you again. Continue always furthering that relationship.
[00:35:37] And you'll find that a couple of years down the road, your business really will run on only referrals.
[00:35:44] Your outbound prospecting will have, you know, you won't have to do as much outbound prospecting.
[00:35:50] So that starts with CMAs. Hey, as a, what I do is I have one of my teammates here or, I mean,
[00:35:57] partners here with eXp since we're not on a formal team. There are no team splits. I have one of my
[00:36:01] partners here send out all of the CMAs to everyone in my past clients. Hey, as a service of working
[00:36:07] with Allie, I am, you know, working with Allie as well. We want to give you an update whether or not
[00:36:12] you, if you, if you're interested or not, you don't have to open this, but just wanted to let you
[00:36:17] know what we've done the research for for you. This is what Zillow says is is what your property is
[00:36:22] worth, but these, this is what the, what your actual property is worth based off of data. And this
[00:36:27] is why if you have any questions, please feel free to reach back out. This is our phone number.
[00:36:31] Look forward to hearing from you. And that's it. That's enough to be long at all. Then the last
[00:36:36] section of this follow up checklist is to send them the shred method link. Shred method, I made a
[00:36:46] video about this as well. It's a, it's a company where you can utilize a line of credit in order to
[00:36:53] pay down or shred your mortgage is super, super fast. I am a big reponent because I personally have
[00:36:59] used it myself before I even told, you know, before I even told anyone about this about this company.
[00:37:04] I love it. And it's a great way for, especially for your investor clients, but really helps anyone out
[00:37:10] to eliminate, like take a, take a 30 year mortgage and instead of paying it over those three decades,
[00:37:17] you could pay it in months or even, or years or even months. I paid off one of my mortgages in four
[00:37:22] months doing this, but this is not about that. So anyway, look into it in case you have investor
[00:37:29] clients or somebody that wants to get rid of the mortgage, which don't we all at the bottom section
[00:37:34] here is red flags. Investors, investors trying to get owner occupied loans without already living in
[00:37:43] the area. That is a red flag. And again, I have this on my trello checklist. So if somebody touches
[00:37:48] this red flag, I know I don't want to work with them. You do not have to work with everyone. You
[00:37:53] are your own business owner. You can choose who and who you work with and who more importantly,
[00:37:58] who you don't. So if an investor is trying to say that they want to get an owner occupied loan,
[00:38:03] which I've had before, and they're like, oh yeah, but I still want to get VA loan or FHA loan.
[00:38:08] No, that's not for me. I'm not doing that. I will not put a jail for you. So next, so I add that
[00:38:15] to the red flag and just my own personal notes here, which maybe I don't know, I should or should not
[00:38:20] be sharing, but either way, you're going to get this when you get a copy of this. If a client cannot
[00:38:25] respond to yes or no questions, it might be too early in the game for them. So again, there's a power,
[00:38:30] there's the power of asking three questions in a row, like three deep why, but if they can't answer
[00:38:37] simple yes or no questions, it's going to be a difficult transaction. So at that point, I
[00:38:43] wouldn't want to work with a client. And then the next thing here is if of course the buyer doesn't
[00:38:50] give you the pre-approval letter or refuses to meet with any lender, then at that point again,
[00:38:56] it might be too early to process for them. They might not be serious buyers yet. And a lot of
[00:39:00] scams, so many scams are happening right now where I'm sure you're getting this to buyers,
[00:39:07] or supposed buyers texting you saying, hey, are you a real estate agent in your state? Like, yes.
[00:39:15] And then they try to get you to talk to them over what's app. I'm not really sure how that scam
[00:39:20] actually ends up playing out, but I don't do that. So just be careful. There's so much scam,
[00:39:27] so many scams going on in this industry right now, especially for real estate agents. Be careful what
[00:39:32] emails you click onto. The same thing that you tell your clients that you're warning your clients about,
[00:39:39] keep that in mind for yourself. So that is everything I've covered the entire home buyer checklist.
[00:39:47] Again, I'm giving away these checklists. Just you just have to meet with me first.
[00:39:52] Calendly, I'll send you my Calendly link. You can text 520-341-2552, text-the-word checklist.
[00:40:00] That will automatically send you the link to it. Only if you text-the-word checklist, one word,

[00:40:09] Again, if this has helped at all, please give, keeping it real, a five-star review. We love hearing
[00:40:15] from you. We're here for the seller checklist. That'll be starting potentially next week.

And now, onto our show. Welcome back to part three of the buyer series Checklist. Again, this is what my group does. We love our checklist. We put everything in the checklist. So that way, we never forget anything. We can sleep easy at night and not wake up in the middle of the night thinking, oh my gosh, did I do this? No. We need to reference the checklist. Anything that you do more than twice should be part of a checklist. So welcome back. Allie Garcede, Allie the agent on all social media. If you have been enjoying this series so far, please go ahead and give DJ and Keeping It Real a Review, Five Star Review on whatever platform you're listening to this on. Whether it's YouTube or Apple or Spotify, please go ahead and do that. DJ does a lot for bettering this industry and I love that. So if you are catching this on part three and you have not yet watched part one or part two, I advise that you go to part one and you watch that on YouTube as opposed to listening to it because as much as I'm trying to vocalize exactly what I'm doing, it's better if you follow along on the computer and can see and create your own checklist. If you don't want to ask me for the checklist here, you can create your own checklist just following along because I'm sharing my screen on everything. So otherwise, if you want the copy of my checklist, I am giving these away for free. Just meet with me first. Text 520-341-2552 or if you just find me on social media, again, that's Allie the agent. I have been meeting with a couple of you and it's so nice that just being able to share the checklist and help other agents out. I love it. I'm here for this. So, text me. I've got a lot of reach outs. I'm here for you. So let's get started on the Trello checklist where I left off at the end of part two of this series was the inspection period and the appraisal period. So assuming that the appraisal comes back and you know buyer and seller agree or it comes back right at the purchase price, excellent. The next step is the next section rather is the before closing checklist. So first item on this checklist is to email clients the before closing checklist, aka buyer email number 5. And again, when you meet with me, you get all these emails as well. So what does buyer email number 5 say? Well, what a good question. I'm so glad you asked. Okay. The first thing again on every single one of my emails is a video. So, so few people do this. Again, people, this is not only another touch that a lot of other REALTORS aren't doing, it's a one time video that you create for all of your clients and they get to see you and hear you again and you know, it's almost as if you're right there with them telling them, hey, these are the next steps. So what does this three minute video say? I pretty much just relay everything of what's already in the body of the email and the text. Because again, if I were to just send this portion here, if you're looking along, it's just words and it's so lengthy and it's so boring. Who wants to read this? Even I don't want to read it. So therefore, even though I made it, you know, bullet format, you know, no paragraphs or few paragraphs, it's boring. So make it as easy for them as possible to follow along. Boom. They can click on this. It goes straight to my bomb bomb, which I pay for 23 bucks a month for the unlimited. I highly suggest you do the same. You can also do loom as well. So the next steps, what does this, what does the text of buyer email number five say? It says number one, transfer all your utilities over to your personal name and your credit card, your checking account starting at the closing date in Arizona, the date of closing or close of escrow belongs to the buyer. It could be different in your state. Definitely check with your team lead, your broker, your, you know, your state leaders. Also along with what so essentially what does the utilities entail? The water sewer trash, the electric, the gas, etc. You also want to make sure that the solar lease or the solar loan, if that applies in this case, is transferred over. So in that way, the seller doesn't have that anymore. And the buyer can take over the loan or the lease, whatever may apply. Number two, so important schedule a locksmith to change the locks on your property, the day of closing once you record. So again, it depends on, you know, it might be different in other states. So so definitely check with your broker. I have had a personal scare with this where my second closing ever, I was representing buyers and they purchased a house from a bigger company and it about two days later, they had not yet scheduled the lock, the locks to be changed. And around midnight, this big company goes into their house, barges into their house and tries to get them to move out of the house, claiming that they were squatters. It was a whole thing. They said that there are no emergencies in real estate. That was actually an emergency. That was so scary. So even if you have never had any bad issues with this, please use my example to tell your buyers the importance of changing the locks as soon as the property records or as soon as you can in your state. Number three, of course, schedule internet and cable because internet, at least in my area, takes a long time to schedule. So you want to make sure that they are ahead of the game. The earlier they can do that, the better. Again, this goes out about a week before closing, so it gives them enough time. And any other subscriptions or people that they'll need. For example, if they have a pool, schedule the pool company, schedule the pest, the weeds, you know, I'm trying to think of other things, but that's all pretty much that we have here. And what happens as you scroll down in this email, then I say, it's been great working with you. I've loved helping you through this home purchasing journey. Again, I repeat that also in the video as well. And the bottom of this email, I say, can I ask you for a favor? Do you know of anyone else that's looking to buy or to sell? And this can be in any state, not just in, you know, enter your city and state because from there, you can get referrals. And I've gotten referrals this way. It's been great actually, not from this email, but from me doing this also in a text. And I'll explain more of that in a bit. And if they do have someone, you know, can you start a group chat and introduce me to them? Instead of them passing on your phone number, what you want is for them to start a group chat with that potential buyer, with that potential seller, with you on it. That way it's a warm handoff and it's a better conversion rate after that. And then I explain what referrals mean because a lot of people don't realize, don't really know what that means. You know, my business runs off referrals. Clients don't know what that means, especially if they've never been in a business owner. So I explain that to them. So, boom, I send buyer email number five to the all buyer parties and heading back to this Trello checklist now. Then I ask them to write a review. Again, this is about a week before closing check the checklist there. So sometimes buyers aren't comfortable yet. They want to make sure that they close. That's totally fine too. I do reiterate to them that the review is just based off of me as a person so far in their experience. So they don't have to wait until closing. But if they prefer to wait until closing, totally fine. I'm here for it. Thank you so much. So of course, Zilla was once you actually have a closings, but Google doesn't have to be. So you can ask for several reviews from the same clients throughout the process. And that's exactly what's next after that is to do it on all of the review platforms. Google, Zilla, REALTOR, Facebook Business Page, if you have that YouTube, whatever it might be. After that, complete the final walkthrough with the buyer or if the final walkthrough waiver applies, then make sure that all the party sign and it's sent over to the brokers for the review. If you're at the final walkthrough, take the keys out of the super box and put them in a general contractor lock box because sometimes, you know, listing agents, of course, coordinate with the listing agent. They'll want to use that super box and, you know, immediately push it on to the next listing that they have. So definitely don't want to keep your keep the keys in there and you definitely want to confirm with the listing agent that it's okay that you remove those keys. So of course, just talk to them and figure out a spot to where the keys are safe and not yet in the buyer's control before, you know, recording, never do that. So just over communicate with the listing agent and work something out there. Then tell the clients to schedule the locksmith to be done after closing or to the closing gift. I just started on with client giant and I love it. I personally am so bad at thinking of closing gifts. Oh, it is so rough. I, it's just a blank sheet of paper when I think of what to give a client for closing. So I send up for client giant. I'm liking it so far. It's actually a pretty good price. Like for example, VIP clients are like a hundred bucks for the year for gifts a year. So that's 25 bucks and I don't have to think about it. Yes, please. So reach out to them in case you also are like me and are a terrible gift giver. Otherwise if you already have clients, client gifts, you know, that you already know what to do. I have made the mistake of ordering them too early like before appraisal because I wanted it to be done on time and I wanted to give it to the client right at closing like when they're signing or when we meet at the house and I give them the keys. But as you know, 25% of all contracts fall out of S-row. So sometimes you're left holding the bag and sometimes you'll give it to them anyway. It's kind of awkward, you know, whatever. So you want to make sure that all the contingencies are removed before you order a gift. Learn from my mistakes, please. So then again, at the bottom here as we continue scrolling through the checklist, just confirm that the clients and the spouses or even adult kids that you've received a review on whatever platforms you're looking for. Again, with Google, it could be character. So hey, Allie was a funny REALTOR. That counts. You know, whatever it might be, it helps. So you definitely want to, you definitely want to increase your Google presence because Google is the number one website in the world followed by YouTube, which is the number two Google owns YouTube. You need to be on both. So if anything, focus on Google reviews with your Google business page and YouTube. But I have a whole whole bunch of other videos on YouTube. I'm definitely increasing my presence there. So day of closing. If the sellers are in town, oops, I meant to say if the buyers are in town. If the buy, let me fix this right here. If the buyers are in town, because this is the buyer checklist, they're in coordinate with them. Go to the closing, go to the signing. Make sure that title tells you when the signing is. Sometimes there's a lot of lost communication there. So you have to stay on title to make sure that they tell you when the closing is. Ask me how I know. Bring your soul key or any sort of additional, you know, something that you want in social media for the clients to post on their pages, as well as you to post on yours and your website. If the buyers are out of town, then go ahead and congratulate them, call them, send the FaceTime them, group phone calls are what people like. So definitely anytime you have good news, call them. Don't waste it on a text. So it's like people love hearing good news. Then if buyers, again, being that I work with mainly military, a lot of, well, all military have access to base. And a lot of times the title companies will wave the notary fee because the buyers or the sellers, whatever military clients that you have, have access to the base and they can avoid paying that $200 mobile notary fee. And they said they could just go to base and sign there. This helps a lot when your clients are coming out from out of country, say they're stationed in Japan or Korea right now, they can go on base there, have the closing documents faxed over to the legal base on there. They coordinate with legal and they can sign there and then fax it back. It saves them $200. There's no buyers will have to go anywhere to travel. It's super, super easy. I really like that a lot. But of course, if they don't have access or if they're not military, then you can just disregard that checklist. Or that check. Then next title is going to be asking you for the information that's needed to get you paid, of course, very important. So this goes specifically more into eXp stuff where we have sky slope and it tells you what buttons to click here to make sure that you get paid. Again, if you're in a different brokerage, then ask other agents around you how to make sure. And then right before closing, call the buyers again with the news saying, hey, so far, so good. Just wanted to say that we are on track. Do you have any questions? And then ask this is a perfect opportunity to ask from referrals. So do you know of anyone else that's looking to buy right now or do you know if anyone wants looking to sell? And then usually, again, because a lot of clients don't know how our business works or what referrals even mean, they're usually like, no, I'm the only one I know moving to Aurora Colorado. And that's when you can say, I actually can work in any state. I can do know of anyone else in looking to move in any state. I would love to help them find an agent that's right for their needs. And usually at that point, you know, what's the most common response is, no, I don't. And then I find that that's a great opportunity for you to really drill in to what to activate their memory. Specific examples. Usually what I find is when people are looking to buy or sell is any life changes. Like maybe someone you know that my that is pregnant now looking to maybe increase and you know upgrade their house or maybe some parents who's like kids just went away for college that might be looking to downsize into something smaller. Do you know of anybody like that or maybe somebody that got a job promotion and then just stay silent for a little bit and see, give them the opportunity to think about it. They might they might have somebody. And if they do again tell them this is the perfect time to train your clients. If you do or when you do instead of you passing on my phone number, I would love if you do me a huge favor and instead of just passing my phone number, if you could introduce me in a group chat, that would be that would mean a lot to me. And they're usually like, oh yeah, too easy. Yeah, I'll introduce you to my friend whenever I find of someone, find out about somebody moving and that usually increases the conversion rate by a lot. So then the last section here on this before closing checklist is clearly a lesson learned for me. So I added it on here. Make sure that the lead base disclosure has been signed by the buyer and that they're given the pamphlet. This almost became a quote. This was a close call for us. So if they don't have an ass here, TC to do it immediately because the fine is big and you'll be the one paying for it. So that's another foolproof measure to make sure that all of your paperwork is good to go. Then we have the after closing checklist and what's the first thing here, buyer email number six, which essentially is asking for a review. Again, in case they haven't yet reviewed, reviewed you. So let's take you over to buyer email number six. Buyer email number six here, subject line, can you leave me a review? And here I say there are thousands of real tours in X City and you chose to work with me. For that, I am so, so thankful. Can you let me know what I could have done to make it an even better experience? And what do I have for that? Of course, a video. It's two minutes long. It describes everything on here that I'm asking for a review and then I'm thanking them for the opportunity that they gave me to work with them. So and here again, after we meet together and you get these checklists, you'll be, you'll see what the video exactly says. After that, scrolling down the email here, can you make a video review of how I helped you? This I usually do also when I'm on the phone with them. And when I'm giving the keys, that's the perfect opportunity to take, to snap a quick video. It doesn't have to be long, 30 seconds. And the only thing that I ask them to do, I'm like, hey, would you mind if I take a quick video of you? And they're usually like, yeah, of course, you know, they're excited. You just help them buy a house. And they're like, yeah, cool. Of course, sometimes they're nervous, but that's natural. Not everyone is okay in front of a camera. So the highest level of testimonials are videos. So if you can get that, you know, the more you can get that and add that to your website, to your Google business page, the more you're going to rank. So definitely ask them. And you can, it doesn't have to be long. The only question they really have to ask or answer is, what was it like working with Allie? So they can start the sentence off that way. Working with Allie was and then just let them say whatever they want to say. And then, you know, the longer the better, of course. But anyway, I'm trilling off a little bit here. So back to buyer email number six. This is where I asked them for a video review. And I also asked them to start off the written review with the following, like IPCS to Davis Month and Air Force Base with an Allie Gar said, help me buy or sell home in XYZ City. And working with Allie was blank. I have this because these are key words. Again, SEO is so, so important when it comes to getting reviews and getting ranked and therefore getting more clients, clients reaching out to you. So being that my meat and potatoes are working with military clients, I want the key words PCS. I want the key word Davis Month and Air Force Base. Of course, you're also going to want to have your name and city. Those having those key words will rank you. So, you know, for example, say you live in, you know, I don't know, I don't know. Any other city, just plug and play this exact beginning into your buyer email number six. And I also give some examples too. Some examples if you were a buyer, how long did we work together that will show other people how patient I am? What type of loan did you have? Because the more that they can share that, the more other people reading those reviews will say, oh man, I also have an FHA loan. Great. It looks like she's done this before and maybe I want to work with her. Then the next is if you were remote during the home buying process, if my team helped you with like during FaceTime or sending you videos of the properties from afar, this is what we do for 90% of our clients. Majority of them have not been in Tucson even until after closing. So and then negotiations, how the negotiations work, how much under did we get the property? How much did you already have an instant equity because of our negotiation skills that you were able to close with and immediately grow your network? How many other offers were on the table and when the sellers chose your offer? And if there weren't any, how far under was the original list price to what we were able to get it under contract for? And was my team helpful in providing guidance? These are just some examples of what they can or of course they don't have to use these, but I'm using these to trigger their memory from the very very beginning of when we met all of the good times that we shared. And then of course I have the link to the Zillow and Google. I also have an example of a previous buyer review. So this, so go through your buyer reviews, find the one that you like the best, find like the one that just stands out and put that review in your template for this email. So in that way, other buyers can start to subliminally see, oh, this is like what she expects. This is going to be, okay, I really beefy, you know, testimonial, a really beefy review. So I do that. And then also at the bottom here, my business runs are referrals, meaning I rely on your word of mouth and telling other buyers and sellers to continue making a living. This is what I do to make a living. So if you know of anywhere of anyone moving anywhere in any state, please connect me. I can connect them to a few real tours that will help them every step of the way. Thank you so much. And then we'll sign a tour block, boom, and then I send it. Now that is buyer email number six, and that is the last of the official emails within the buyer process, but we're not done with the checklist. So after that, of course, you get the keys from seller. And if it's an I buyer, make sure, or pretty much if it has like a programming, if it has a, if the house has a keypad, you want to make sure that you have the instructions on how to erase all of the old codes and reprogram it, or maybe just buy a whole new one in case you don't have that. Again, changing your changing keys, as you know, it's not a cheap at all. Locksmiths make pretty good money. So make sure that your buyers know about how much to expect to change out all the locks. Then in bold here, in all of my checklist on my Trello, anything in bold is what I have my assistant do. So the assistant will add the client photo, the client testimonial to my website, to social media, and to post. This is also a great way on specifically on Instagram for you to invite the client as a collaborator, because that way it's that same post and it not only shows up in front of your audience, but now you're showing up in front of their audience. Even if their audience is a hundred people, it doesn't matter how few of their followers are, you get in front of a whole new audience. So now their friends can say, oh my gosh, wow, Ashley could close with Ali. Who is this Ali person? They're showing up on my feed because I'm friends with client Ashley, but REALTOR Ali seems pretty cool. Maybe I'll follow her. Maybe it'll become a relationship later on. And then add them to Homebot in case you're using Homebot. Homebot also was a group. It's a great way to get an inside scoop on if your clients are looking into the valuation of their home. How reliant they are with accurate information. That's another story. It might be really good in your area. It might not. A lot of lenders do pay for this already because it's a great way for them to see if the buyers want to refinance. So they're always keeping an eye on this. So reach out to a couple of lenders and see if they already have Homebot. They usually have, I think, between 8 to 10 slots available for them to give two agents. So reach out. And then one day after that, I reconfirmed that the clients have reviewed me on all the platforms. And it's a lot of platforms, right? Like you want to be everywhere. So to make this as simple as possible, I tell them, hey, I know it's a lot, but you only have to put effort into one review and then you can just copy and paste into everything else. And I want to catch that early. I do it one day after just to make sure. Because otherwise, if I'm doing it, you know, two months later, when I remember later on down the road, they're not going to want to do it. The honeymoon phase is over. They're high from purchasing a house is gone. So catch it early. And then of course find out, find out the status of the closing gift in case you're using client giant or anything else like that. Make sure that that's being worked on. And again, the next two items are ways to or reminders to review the other, the cross agent. Of course, if they're good, I'm not a fan of leaving bad reviews. But so if the cross agent was exceptional, you liked working with them and you truly want to work with them again, write them a business review on Google, help their business out because it's such a small world and the amount of agents that help other agents is very small. I'm finding. So anything that we can do to help each other out, it will come back to you. You know, like, so leave them a review. Like, and this is what I have an example here. I'm another agent in this same marketplace. But if, but this message is to every other agent, if you ever have a chance to work with the Sydney, you're considered yourself lucky. They know what they're doing for their client. We help them close or we work together on XYZ transaction like from Ali Gar said, REALTOR, blah, blah, blah. That helps them out so much. And guess what? Next time they have a listing and you're the buyer, guess who they're going to want to work with? You. So. And then the same thing here right at the bottom after this is invite them to any sort of annual parties events or really any event. Just keep that relationship going. I also have inside this bullet here is to let them know that it's not a recruiting event. Again, I work with eXp. So therefore, we have to like explain ourselves like, no, we're actually here to work. Like we're not here to recruit. So yeah, so I have that in the script here in case you are eXp. Like I mentioned before, I think if it was in my first video with this one or my my interview with DJ, but whenever I call an agent from a different brokerage, I literally have to say, hey, it's Ali Gar said, I'm a local REALTOR here with eXp Realty. Don't worry, I'm not trying to recruit you. And then I leave a little bit of a pause because they're usually like, oh, they laugh or they're like, oh, thank goodness. You know, I've already gone 10, 15 calls a day. And I'm like, no, I'm actually representing a buyer and we're interested in one to three main street. You know, when can I view it? So I definitely, in other eXp agents, no, they definitely have to like be on the defense like, hey, no, we're not trying to recruit. We're just trying to be friends. Okay, anyway, carrying on. Then after you add all the photos and the videos taken with the client at the closing or presenting the closing gift or at their house, put it in your Google business page. Anything you can do at least once a week to ramp up your Google business page, do it. Especially if they leave a video testimonial, ooh, that is perfect. They're on your on your YouTube, they're on your business page and watch yourself rank on page one. So also, if in case you want to do this, I know this is like a whole nother thing on its own, but you can also add that address of the property to a Google page that you own sites.google.com. You can create a website there and where you can have like a lot of different pin points of, hey, these are all the homes that I sold. So in case you ever need to prove yourself pretty much to a buyer or a seller, you can say, hey, these are all the homes that I've sold in the last or ever. Zillow does this too, but sometimes I feel like they don't capture everything. So this is a good way for you to pinpoint and show buyers or sellers in your listing presentation or your buyer consultation. Then the next section that we have here is following up one month after closing. I have realized that a lot of agents are scared to reach out to their clients because as you know, as I know, something always breaks, right? Especially if it's a first time home buyer, something is going to break within the first three months. It's just inevitable. So therefore a lot of agents are scared to make that call and they're like, oh my gosh, I know that that like, you know, maybe the AC is a little bit older or, you know, something. They're scared of actually following up and saying, hey, is everything going okay? But the clients want that. The clients need that from you. Instead, what a lot of agents do is close, you know, they post their stuff on social media, and then they call it a day, they boom, they disappear. Right when that client might actually need them the most, like, oh my gosh, my water heater just broke or, you know, something they need a contractor, they need a, they need an introduction to somebody that you know, but you didn't ask them. Sometimes the clients don't feel comfortable reaching out to you. They might think you're too busy. They might think you're, that's not your, you know, scope of work anymore. And although legally, it's not. It's a way to even further develop that relationship. So one month after closing or, you know, even one week out, but definitely one month, one after as well, reach out to them saying, hey, how are things going with their home? Like, honestly, how are things going? And let them tell you they might say, oh my gosh, we freaking love it. I, you know, that's it. Like all butterflies and roses or they might say actually the roof caved in, you know, something like Roborse case scenario, you can connect them to a real estate attorney or a contractor or a landscaping person because their weeds are now out of control. Whatever it is, just be a resource for them. They want that from you. And that's another perfect opportunity to see if they are looking, if they know of anybody yet, if they ever found remembered somebody that had a job promotion, etc, etc for a referral. And then after that, about five months after closing, that's when I mail out the six month gift. Like happy six months of being in your home. I, we mail them a candle, small candle, branded and a card. And then about 11 months after right before their one year home of her three, we mail them a bottle of wine. Of course, if they don't drink, we mail them something else with our logo and a card as well. A lot of times people will keep this card, especially if you got them a killer deal like, hey, I'm so, I'm so happy that we work together and you are able to increase your net worth by $17,000 just by closing on this house. That is something that they will keep on their fridge for a long time. And whenever they have guests over, they're going to say, oh my gosh, wow, you made $17,000. You added that to your net worth by purchasing this house. And whose name are they going to read at the bottom there? Allie the agent. So don't, don't sleep on, on cards. They're, they're amazing. And then every three months, again, if you have access to that home bot, you can log in, see if they, see if they've logged in at all, they may, they may, they may have not, they may have not, they may, have not, why does that sound weird? Anyway, carrying on, sending holiday cards around the holidays, always good to do, again, staying in touch with them and sending birthday cards to the buyer or if they're also married, the spouses, the kids, whichever, you know, the best way that you, that you increase your relationship with them. So just stay top of mind and do it genuinely. So if you're, you know, driving by the area or maybe even if you're not, say, hey, I, call them. I was just thinking about you. Hope you're having a great day. And that's it. Again, people like positive phone calls. You, you don't want to correlate your phone calls to mean bad news, which side note is what a lot of property managers do. So it's nice to flip that on its head. Then keep sending the review me email that buyer email number six for the reviews. If they haven't already done it and asked for a video review, just in case they haven't done it yet. And when they do review, actually respond. Google sees if you're responding to your Google reviews. And the way that you respond is everything. So make sure that you're professional, make sure that you're, you know, whatever your brand is. If you're funny, if you're loud, if you're sarcastic, whatever it is, respond to the review. And when they do review, blast it on, on all of your social media on your Instagram, your TikTok, your YouTube, your website everywhere. And every year, send a CMA. I would probably actually even do this month six. So month six. And then probably every year after that send a CMA, again, another touch point to stay in front of them because you never know, you never know when they might be looking to sell, when they might be looking to purchase another property. So they could refinance or, you know, pull money out of that one, purchase another one, you want them to become forever clients. And this is something that I learned from the Tom Ferry summit that I went to a couple of months ago that I'm recording this right now in 2023. They said to stop calling these clients past clients eliminate the term past clients from your vocabulary. They should be forever clients, just like you should be there forever REALTOR. So that doesn't mean one transaction and they never hear from you again. Continue always furthering that relationship. And you'll find that a couple of years down the road, your business really will run on only referrals. Your outbound prospecting will have, you know, you won't have to do as much outbound prospecting. So that starts with CMAs. Hey, as a, what I do is I have one of my teammates here or, I mean, partners here with eXp since we're not on a formal team. There are no team splits. I have one of my partners here send out all of the CMAs to everyone in my past clients. Hey, as a service of working with Allie, I am, you know, working with Allie as well. We want to give you an update whether or not you, if you, if you're interested or not, you don't have to open this, but just wanted to let you know what we've done the research for for you. This is what Zillow says is is what your property is worth, but these, this is what the, what your actual property is worth based off of data. And this is why if you have any questions, please feel free to reach back out. This is our phone number. Look forward to hearing from you. And that's it. That's enough to be long at all. Then the last section of this follow up checklist is to send them the shred method link. Shred method, I made a video about this as well. It's a, it's a company where you can utilize a line of credit in order to pay down or shred your mortgage is super, super fast. I am a big reponent because I personally have used it myself before I even told, you know, before I even told anyone about this about this company. I love it. And it's a great way for, especially for your investor clients, but really helps anyone out to eliminate, like take a, take a 30 year mortgage and instead of paying it over those three decades, you could pay it in months or even, or years or even months. I paid off one of my mortgages in four months doing this, but this is not about that. So anyway, look into it in case you have investor clients or somebody that wants to get rid of the mortgage, which don't we all at the bottom section here is red flags. Investors, investors trying to get owner occupied loans without already living in the area. That is a red flag. And again, I have this on my trello checklist. So if somebody touches this red flag, I know I don't want to work with them. You do not have to work with everyone. You are your own business owner. You can choose who and who you work with and who more importantly, who you don't. So if an investor is trying to say that they want to get an owner occupied loan, which I've had before, and they're like, oh yeah, but I still want to get VA loan or FHA loan. No, that's not for me. I'm not doing that. I will not put a jail for you. So next, so I add that to the red flag and just my own personal notes here, which maybe I don't know, I should or should not be sharing, but either way, you're going to get this when you get a copy of this. If a client cannot respond to yes or no questions, it might be too early in the game for them. So again, there's a power, there's the power of asking three questions in a row, like three deep why, but if they can't answer simple yes or no questions, it's going to be a difficult transaction. So at that point, I wouldn't want to work with a client. And then the next thing here is if of course the buyer doesn't give you the pre-approval letter or refuses to meet with any lender, then at that point again, it might be too early to process for them. They might not be serious buyers yet. And a lot of scams, so many scams are happening right now where I'm sure you're getting this to buyers, or supposed buyers texting you saying, hey, are you a real estate agent in your state? Like, yes. And then they try to get you to talk to them over what's app. I'm not really sure how that scam actually ends up playing out, but I don't do that. So just be careful. There's so much scam, so many scams going on in this industry right now, especially for real estate agents. Be careful what emails you click onto. The same thing that you tell your clients that you're warning your clients about, keep that in mind for yourself. So that is everything I've covered the entire home buyer checklist. Again, I'm giving away these checklists. Just you just have to meet with me first. Calendly, I'll send you my Calendly link. You can text 520-341-2552, text-the-word checklist. That will automatically send you the link to it. Only if you text-the-word checklist, one word, no emojis, otherwise it doesn't work. But if you have any questions, I'm Ali the agent. Again, if this has helped at all, please give, keeping it real, a five-star review. We love hearing from you. We're here for the seller checklist. That'll be starting potentially next week. So thank you so much for tuning in. We'll see you on the next one.
