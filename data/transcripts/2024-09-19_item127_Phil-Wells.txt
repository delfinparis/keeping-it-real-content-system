[00:01:21] Today's episode is brought to you by corded.io.
[00:01:25] Are you looking for agents to join your brokerage team?
[00:01:29] Now, as a real estate recruiter, I can tell you the answer is always yes.
[00:01:33] But most agents aren't looking to move right now.
[00:01:36] So how do you know who to contact?
[00:01:38] Well, what if I were to tell you there's a recruiting and retention tool powered by artificial
[00:01:42] intelligence that shows you exactly which agents in your local market are looking to leave their
[00:01:48] brokerage right now and which agents at your own firm are also looking to leave you?
[00:01:54] Now, I've been recruiting REALTORS for 15 years and I've hired over 2000 agents.
[00:01:58] I can tell you with no exaggeration, this is the tool I've been waiting for.
[00:02:03] Corded AI looks for trends across dozens of variables for each agent in your market
[00:02:08] and shows you which agents they believe are likely to move.
[00:02:11] Not only does it do that, but corded AI went and visited my recruiting website and read
[00:02:16] everything I offer.
[00:02:18] So now when I'm recruiting, corded AI tells me exactly what to say based on that agent's needs
[00:02:24] and what my brokerage can offer.
[00:02:26] It even writes emails for me.
[00:02:28] I've never seen anything like it and I use it every single day.
[00:02:32] Now, if you are looking to grow your brokerage, corded.io is the best tool out there.

[00:05:34] Phil, thanks for coming on the show.
[00:05:36] Well, thanks for having me, DJ.
[00:05:38] I'm super excited to talk with you because I, well, number one, I just got back from New
[00:05:44] York City and I have such a, well, I think most of us have such fond experiences, you
[00:05:50] know, visiting New York and I always think like if I was just a little wealthier, maybe
[00:05:55] I'd, maybe I'd live there, but, but I, I'm happy here in Chicago, but I do love visiting
[00:06:01] and so, so grateful to be able to talk to somebody because somebody who practices in New York
[00:06:07] because I think it is a really difficult market.
[00:06:10] Obviously, we know the pricing is like there, but would love to kind of go all the way
[00:06:15] back to the beginning of your story.
[00:06:17] I know you're not from originally from, from New York, but how did you get to New York?
[00:06:21] How did you start in real estate?
[00:06:23] Yeah, well, I feel like people's starting real estate is always a little bit, a little bit
[00:06:29] interesting, you know, people come, it can be a second career for some.
[00:06:34] For me, it was really a first career.
[00:06:35] I'm just hitting, you know, just over 10 years now in real estate.
[00:06:40] When I first started, I had moved to the city very much like two suitcases in a dream,
[00:06:45] just loved, loved New York and I didn't, you know, I didn't have that much of a plan
[00:06:50] besides I was helping my father at the time with a small publishing company.
[00:06:55] It wasn't a big concern, but it gave me just enough, just enough to pay basically the rent
[00:07:00] and scrape a little extra money for something else.
[00:07:04] You know, I was, I know that if you pay over 40% of your income and rent, you rent burdened.
[00:07:08] I was very rent burdened.
[00:07:09] Let's put it that way.
[00:07:11] I came out here with a couple thousand dollars in my, you know, account and two suitcases
[00:07:16] and it was a big risk, you know, but when you're in your early 20s, it's like, all right,
[00:07:19] you know, I can, I can, I can take that risk.
[00:07:22] So I found a place, I found a room that I rented in like a, you know, there was like a
[00:07:27] 10 room house that I was renting in.
[00:07:30] It was kind of a crazy place to live for a couple of months, but I, you know, kind of found
[00:07:36] my footing in New York that was way out in Bushwick and it was a cool place and I met some
[00:07:41] people, some of which we're doing real estate and they were doing, you know, rentals and
[00:07:45] rentals is a big market, you know, out in New York.
[00:07:48] So I was doing, you know, I saw what they were doing, but then I also was interested in
[00:07:55] it, but not necessarily with who, you know, with that particular company because they weren't
[00:08:01] really the most credible company.
[00:08:03] So I did what I always do in these situations, which I reached out to a bunch of people in
[00:08:07] the industry and tried to set up little, you know, one-on-ones and informational interviews.
[00:08:12] And then I met through a friend of a friend of a friend, I met someone who was working
[00:08:18] for the Corcoran Group, which at that time was one of the bigger companies and after a quick
[00:08:24] meeting with the managing broker at the Fort Green Office, Julianna Brown Deriggs, who will
[00:08:29] always have a, you know, I'll have a soft spot for her.
[00:08:32] She decided that, you know, she would take a risk on this kid from Idaho who really had
[00:08:38] no connections.
[00:08:38] Yeah, no sphere of influence, right?
[00:08:41] No sphere of influence.
[00:08:42] I knew about six people in the city and, you know, I had some sales experience, you know,
[00:08:48] from stuff I'd done in college, but I mean, that was pretty much it.
[00:08:50] I just, you know, it was one of those, I'm really happy she took a chance on me.
[00:08:55] And what she told me, which when I first started was, although this isn't a nine to five
[00:09:00] job, I want you to be in the office at nine a.m. and I want you to work more than 40 hours
[00:09:06] a week in the office.
[00:09:07] That desk over there is yours.
[00:09:09] That computer over there is yours.
[00:09:10] I want you to be here all the time that you're not out with clients.
[00:09:14] And I really took that to heart in the first year.
[00:09:16] I was just in the office learning what I could, absorbing what I could.
[00:09:20] And I really credit a lot of my early, my early deals and my early success to being in
[00:09:26] the office.
[00:09:28] I'd thank you.
[00:09:29] That's a really, I love when I hear a story like this where it's very much a similar
[00:09:35] story that I've heard a lot, but I think we can't ever hear it enough, which is, you
[00:09:42] know, there's these little foundational skills or foundational habits that we all, you
[00:09:47] know, could benefit from, whether it's, you know, exercising more or, you know, being
[00:09:52] more present in for our families or, you know, our relationships or like maybe, you know,
[00:09:58] maybe treating this like an actual job from nine to five, because I find that that is
[00:10:03] absolutely one of the most common characteristics among top producers is they treat it like it's
[00:10:08] a job.
[00:10:09] I have to be there at a certain time.
[00:10:10] I stay a certain amount of time and, and then I, I go home and you have, of course, you
[00:10:14] know, you have more for freedom than that.
[00:10:16] But I love the idea of treating it like an actual job.
[00:10:19] I suspect people would do a lot better in this business if they wet, you know, even if
[00:10:24] they wet somewhere in their own house every day from nine to five and really treated it
[00:10:28] that way.
[00:10:28] I'm curious, you know, so you're at this desk, you're, you're absorbing what you're hearing
[00:10:34] and going on, you know, within the, within the brokerage.
[00:10:38] But what are you doing actually to go grow your business?
[00:10:41] You know, you didn't have, you know, you know, you know, you six people, but what we're
[00:10:45] actually doing to move the business forward.
[00:10:48] Yeah.
[00:10:48] So at that time, there was an agent who sat across from me who was, I was learning a lot
[00:10:52] from him, who had, you know, he was a sole operator.
[00:10:55] He wasn't a member of any team or anything like that.
[00:10:57] He'd been in the business for like 30 years and I would listen a lot to him and I'd bounce
[00:11:01] ideas off of him.
[00:11:02] Uh, but yeah, boy, it was tough for the first bit.
[00:11:05] You're, we did get a certain amount of what we called floor duty.
[00:11:08] I don't know.
[00:11:09] I'm thinking of, you know, other agents.
[00:11:11] It's not as common in New York because a lot of our offices don't have a retail store
[00:11:14] front, but this one happened to.
[00:11:16] So it was in Fort Green, 65 Lafayette Avenue.
[00:11:19] I know because I wrote that so many times on handwritten, you know, letters to, you know,
[00:11:24] co-ops condos nearby townhouses.
[00:11:28] So that was one thing I was doing is I would try to get out mail just, you know, as much
[00:11:32] mail handwritten front.
[00:11:33] I don't know if it still works as much these days, but it did work that, you know, getting
[00:11:38] people to reach back out, you know, to expires, but even people who would just
[00:11:43] own for like that seven to 10 year range where, you know, if it's a one bedroom or two
[00:11:49] bedroom, they might be looking to make a move.
[00:11:51] They might be looking to rent it out.
[00:11:52] They might be, you know, so that was something I would target.
[00:11:56] I would target a little bit of rentals that were turning over just, you know, you got
[00:12:01] to imagine 11 months into a lease.
[00:12:03] They're thinking either that's it's going to move out or not.
[00:12:07] And then I had a mentor, Jean was her name and I was helping her with her listings for free.
[00:12:13] So I just said, Jean, I'm here for you, open houses, weekends, whatever, you know,
[00:12:18] help you go take photos for this listing, you know, I was just going all over.
[00:12:23] And one of the deals, she wasn't always in her office and she said I could answer her phone.
[00:12:28] So I answered her phone and my first sale came from answering an angry call that was
[00:12:33] yelling at me about.
[00:12:34] So I pick up the phone and she says, does this listing even have a dishwasher?
[00:12:41] And so well, thanks for calling today.
[00:12:44] I'm not sure which listing you're talking about.
[00:12:46] What's the address that you're looking at?
[00:12:48] 55 pineapple 2J.
[00:12:51] Well, let me look it up.
[00:12:52] You know, it's on our system.
[00:12:54] Thanks for calling Corcoran, you know, blah, blah, blah.
[00:12:56] And I ended up saying, I don't want to say her name, but I ended up saying, you know,
[00:13:02] she was looking for her son and she was frustrated because it never said in the listings.
[00:13:07] And it never said whether I'm not a dishwasher.
[00:13:10] So I told her, no matter what, we're going to find your son in a department that he's happy with.
[00:13:14] And it's going to have a dishwasher.
[00:13:15] Just use me and I'm going to take you all around the city.
[00:13:17] We're going to find this for you.
[00:13:19] And it was my first deal.
[00:13:21] And you know, it was it was a co-purchase with her and her son for 550,000 on second Avenue.
[00:13:27] And it's funny.
[00:13:28] You just remember all of the addresses and deals, you know, that you do.
[00:13:31] But that was, you know, how did I get my start?
[00:13:34] It was just grinding.
[00:13:36] I mean, there was nothing easy about the first couple of years.
[00:13:40] Yeah, it never is.
[00:13:41] It seems to be even the agents that do have more immediate success seem to still,
[00:13:47] you know, unless they're just extraordinarily fortunate,
[00:13:50] tend to grind it out for the first two to four years.
[00:13:53] And then hopefully by then it starts, you know, business starts kind of coming in a little bit more easily.
[00:13:58] So I like this.
[00:13:59] You partnered with not only did you find a place that wanted you to come into the office and sort of absorb
[00:14:07] the knowledge that was being shared inside of those walls.
[00:14:11] And then also partnering with other brokers in the office, you know, you, you,
[00:14:15] you sat across from somebody, you were able to listen to them.
[00:14:18] You were also able to for free say, hey, I will help you with your listings, you know,
[00:14:23] Mrs. or Miss broker.
[00:14:25] And you know, that is typically I find that people who are willing to do things for free,
[00:14:30] which I know is not comfortable for anybody.
[00:14:33] Nobody wants to do anything for free.
[00:14:34] Because of course we all have bills to pay.
[00:14:37] But I do find that people who are willing to do that kind of work usually succeed.
[00:14:43] I sort of not sure if there's more to that, but it seems to be the pathway to success seems
[00:14:49] to be a little bit about contribution along the way and just sort of willing to do things that maybe
[00:14:55] you know, the extra mile or going above and beyond.
[00:14:57] Well, definitely people are always agents for a very quick once you start providing value to them
[00:15:03] to say, hey, I'll give you 10% of this deal.
[00:15:05] When it closes, it could be 10 for 10, 20, I mean, you started it.
[00:15:08] I started a 10%.
[00:15:09] I started at zero.
[00:15:10] Then I went to 10%.
[00:15:11] And then I started saying, look, I'll work with you.
[00:15:13] I'll do the bulk of the work on this for 25%.
[00:15:16] Or you know, you just, but what I found is doing the math, it's probably different in New York
[00:15:21] where the commissions are higher.
[00:15:22] But you know, if I'm working on someone with a $1.1 million listing at 3% to the to the seller side,
[00:15:28] which is what we were tending to do, that's a $33,000 gross commission.
[00:15:33] 10% of that was $3,300 bucks.
[00:15:36] Then I had my own split and everything, but just talking about the GCI.
[00:15:40] Versus if they were, and the amount of work that I was, you know, say I was putting in 10 or 20
[00:15:44] hours or 30 hours for that, well, for me, that was $100 an hour at the time, with future upside,
[00:15:51] right?
[00:15:51] Whereas if they were paying me $50 a showing, that's just not the way.
[00:15:56] I think that if you're doing that showing, this showing, you're never going to do 100
[00:16:01] showings for an agent. But they pretty quickly will trust you and they'll, if you're working with
[00:16:07] them, it's good faith, you know, and it's, you're also going to learn from them.
[00:16:10] I just think that partnering with more senior agents in your office can be a really,
[00:16:16] that's what I'm glad I stumbled into it.
[00:16:19] But for the young agents listening now and just getting their start, that's, I think, the thing
[00:16:23] that helped me the most.
[00:16:25] I've heard it time and time again and I'm glad to hear it one more time with you because it
[00:16:31] does seem to be the pathway or at least the easier path than doing it all yourself without,
[00:16:37] you know, that kind of support and just being around people who are smarter or at least smarter
[00:16:43] within the industry or, you know, they've been experienced longer or have additional skills that
[00:16:48] you haven't yet developed is they tend to kind of rub off on you too. Like I find that, you know,
[00:16:54] just through, you know, immersion, you're there and hearing people do their pitches, hearing how
[00:17:00] they handle objections on the phone, hearing how they handle an angry client and understanding,
[00:17:05] oh, I could do that. Yeah, it's, there's so much learning that goes on that I think a lot of agents
[00:17:10] could benefit from if they spent more time with some of those senior agents. I really want to jump
[00:17:16] into your YouTube videos because this is such a unique thing that you do and it really gets
[00:17:22] me excited because after 600 plus episodes of the show, I don't get to hear too many sort of
[00:17:28] new and exciting ideas as often as I sure I would love to and what you did is very unique and it
[00:17:36] worked out really well for you and it was fun. Before we started recording Phil was starting to tell
[00:17:41] me the story and you could just see his whole face kind of lit up when he was telling how exciting
[00:17:46] this all was. So let's kind of go to the beginning of, you know, your social media marketing or your
[00:17:53] video marketing, you know, tell us how that's evolved and then we'll get to sort of, you know,
[00:17:58] the what you're doing now and how that's really accelerated the amount of visibility you have.
[00:18:04] Sure, sure. Well, I would say a lot of it. I'm actually going to credit a lot of this, the origin
[00:18:09] of this, to working with an influencer in New York, his name was Cash Jordan and he did a lot of,
[00:18:15] you probably, you might be familiar with him. Yeah, he did a lot, like almost a daily video for a long
[00:18:21] time about, you know, rental apartments or starting out with rental apartments and then he started
[00:18:27] doing a few, I started to see him do a few more higher value, higher ticket ones and I immediately
[00:18:32] reached out to him because again, I send a lot of cold emails to people just, you know, hey,
[00:18:37] you know, I see what you're doing, I support it, you know, just I always, I'm always, if I'm
[00:18:42] thinking about them for longer than five, ten minutes, I'm just going to send an email because
[00:18:46] why not reach out and if you as long as you're okay with a 10 or 20% response rate,
[00:18:51] then just reach out to people and say, you know, say hello, they'll often be supportive of what
[00:18:56] you're doing or they won't have time, but anyway, I'm always encouraging people if you're in sales,
[00:19:00] do cold reach outs. It also helps you hone that writing skill and you see what works and you see
[00:19:06] what doesn't work. Anyway, I reached out to Cash and I said, hey, we have a lot of, you know,
[00:19:10] listings right now we'd love to promote. Maybe you want to come and do a tour of something for sale,
[00:19:14] not for rent. It's right near this one, you just did one on 55th Street, this is on 56th Street.
[00:19:20] Let's take a look. So he would, he reached right back out and he's like, yeah, I'd love to do that.
[00:19:24] Let's schedule it for a couple of weeks from now. So after doing, you know, one, two, three, ten,
[00:19:30] twelve of these with him on his YouTube channel, I started to see the power of it. I actually got
[00:19:35] someone to reach out directly to me saying, hey, you know, me and my wife were looking for an
[00:19:39] apartment and I said, oh, okay, hold on, hold on, hold on. You know, because they said it seems like
[00:19:44] you would do a lot of work in this neighborhood. It seems like you do a lot of work. So I said,
[00:19:48] and a lot of people in the comments said that Phil should have his own channel and I was starting to say,
[00:19:52] maybe I should, maybe I should, but it just seemed like a whole nother, as the business was
[00:19:57] increasing and as we were starting to put a team together, it seemed like a lot to do.
[00:20:02] So I was a little intimidated by it. I didn't do anything for six months and then I thought, you know
[00:20:07] what? I got to do something here. So I started doing Instagram videos, shorter form, tick-tock,
[00:20:14] all the stuff that everyone else is kind of doing and I wasn't getting a lot of traction with it.
[00:20:19] And then I started from kind of from scratch thinking, what could I do that's so different,
[00:20:25] so much bigger that people would have to watch. They'd just be like, you know, what's really,
[00:20:29] really, really interesting. And I started with what's really interesting to me, which is like these
[00:20:35] grand castles and shadows and like, you know, high dollar things, but not just like a inesil
[00:20:42] mazer type of like Beverly Hills type of home, but something that's like historic and, you know,
[00:20:47] just dramatic and really cool. And then I saw Dunbeath Castle, which is the one that you,
[00:20:53] I think you said, you saw this, this castle in Scotland. And I tried my approach. I reached out
[00:21:01] to them and I said, you know, hey, here's what I'd like to do. Here's what I'm proposing. I'll fly
[00:21:06] over there with my crew and everything and, you know, it'll be kind of similar to this that I've
[00:21:11] done, but it's going to be even higher quality. And didn't hear back for a couple of weeks.
[00:21:16] Didn't really think anything of it. But my birthday was coming up and I had a birthday trip that I
[00:21:21] wanted to go, I wanted to go to Europe. I kind of wanted to do this anyway. So I reached out to a
[00:21:25] bunch of other, I was like, well, if I can't get that one, I'm going to try to get this one,
[00:21:28] this one, this one, this one, this one, this one, this one, I reached out to about 10 more.
[00:21:32] And then DJ, something happened that got me a little kind of freak me out a little bit.
[00:21:38] All of them started getting back to me like two weeks later and they all started saying yes.
[00:21:43] I was like, oh, I know. I have like free publicity. Sure. We'll take that.
[00:21:49] Yeah. And like, you're going to produce like a 10 to 20 minute video on our property.
[00:21:53] You're going to pay for everything. You're going to fly over here. Like, great. Let's do it.
[00:21:57] You're going to do it for free. So then I had to like back pedal a little bit and say, okay,
[00:22:02] I could do these. Maybe I can do a trip. I can do one a day. You know, I can do like four.
[00:22:07] And I didn't realize what I was getting involved in as far as the, you know, the scripting,
[00:22:12] the editing, the, you know, just the sheer amount of work that one 20 minute video takes. You know,
[00:22:18] you think, oh, you know, I'm going to record it. That'll take maybe one day. I can probably edit it in a
[00:22:23] week. Get it out there. Get it done. I learned it's a little more than that. But, you know, it's,
[00:22:31] they started performing. They started doing pretty well. And it got really exciting to see that,
[00:22:36] you know, to see, you know, you're, it was 10 times the effort, but it was getting a thousand times
[00:22:43] the results, which is, wow. What was really cool. And so how much time would you estimate you spent
[00:22:49] on some of those videos each, you know, being that you thought, well, probably take a week. And
[00:22:56] also we should mention your full time REALTOR too. So this isn't something that you're doing
[00:23:01] as your only sort of, you know, thing marketing, I think. So how long did it actually, does it
[00:23:07] actually take you to edit a 20 minute video? Yeah. So I was surprised that a professional editor will
[00:23:13] take, you know, about two hours per minute of finished product, something like that. So when you're
[00:23:19] budgeting editing time, you know, that would, I always thought this stupid three minute video just
[00:23:24] took me eight hours to edit. I must be an idiot. You know, it must be, when I was trying it on,
[00:23:28] on DaVinci or whatever myself, there's a lot of good free editing software that you can use now.
[00:23:33] There's a ton of good, you know, if you have the time, if you're a new agent, you have the time
[00:23:37] to learn editing, not only can you probably start editing for other agents and charge and make a
[00:23:43] side business out of that, but you get, there's so many good ways of learning it just by watching,
[00:23:49] you know, tutorials on YouTube and that sort of thing. So I would encourage people who have an
[00:23:53] interest in that to do it, but I would not necessarily encourage a new, an agent who has an
[00:23:58] existing bit of business to think that it's only going to be just make sure you budget the time
[00:24:02] needed for it. And boy, is it depressing when you put something out that only gets, you know,
[00:24:07] a thousand views or whatever and you've put so much time, you know, so how long does it take?
[00:24:13] I, because I, I was really, I hired the editing out. So, you know, I was, you know, how much of the
[00:24:20] cut, you know, probably, you know, it could be on the low end, you know, one to two thousand per
[00:24:25] video of a, you know, on the high end, depending maybe five thousand, you know, so they, but I was
[00:24:31] hiring, you know, pretty good editors, you know, that, and I wasn't afraid of some investment
[00:24:36] in this project, because I thought it would have not necessarily that it would come back in the
[00:24:42] form of like ad revenue, but I thought it would come back, you know, if I get one client and I
[00:24:46] generate 50,000 in GCI off it, you know, it, okay, it's paid for the whole project and it increases
[00:24:52] the brand value and everything. So, but then again, you know, it, it also, what really encouraged me
[00:24:59] towards this whole project in the first place was getting more listings because of what I could
[00:25:04] offer new clients. So we just, I'll say more about that. Well, we just, so what I noticed is
[00:25:11] we tend to get a lot of our really good closing ratio for our pitch ratio. So, you know, if we go on
[00:25:18] my partner Pam and I do a really good presentation in person, you know, and I think that there's
[00:25:25] something about our presentation that, you know, I come in, I'm kind of the ideas guy, I have a lot of,
[00:25:29] you know, here's eight things we can do that no one else has done, you know, from artistic
[00:25:34] renderings of, you know, the room is, you know, to coming in with renovation ideas to, you know,
[00:25:41] painting and staging and, but then, you know, hiring a drone that is pretty tough to do in New York
[00:25:46] because of the airspace stuff, you know, a drone that will open the window and it'll fly into the
[00:25:52] apartment and it'll, you know, just a little razzle dazzle that a lot of other agents just don't do.
[00:25:57] And I think that it's not that one idea will totally sell the person on us, but it's that we're
[00:26:05] bringing energy and enthusiasm to a listing that otherwise, you know, it might just be someone who's
[00:26:10] just going to take photos and do a floor plan and put it up on, you know, on our equivalent of
[00:26:14] Zillow. And anyway, one thing that I kept getting and hearing from clients is that they're interested
[00:26:20] in video way more than when I started, you know, in the industry, that wasn't really a thing. And I
[00:26:27] just kept hearing it more and more. And I was like, you know what? I guess I'm going to have to become
[00:26:32] an expert in video just so that we can close more pitches. You know, we can close get more listings.
[00:26:38] And so that was kind of where I started with the going back to cash Jordan. There were several
[00:26:43] listings where I said, look, we're going to get this featured. We're going to get 500,000 views on
[00:26:47] this property. And it, you know, we've already seen results with it, but it's really, it's going to help,
[00:26:52] right? And we're going to bring cash Jordan in. And so we did. And, you know, he knew that that helped us,
[00:26:58] you know, he was doing well with, you know, with ad revenue and everything. And he also owned a real estate
[00:27:03] company. So it was helping him. It was helping us. But eventually I knew that, you know, you don't want to,
[00:27:08] you don't want to build your house on land that you rent, right? You want to, you kind of want your own
[00:27:13] platform. You want your own thing. And ultimately, I'm glad I did because he sort of, he's been doing
[00:27:18] more news-based content lately. And so, you know, it would have been bad if I was 100% relying on his
[00:27:25] distribution. Sure. So anyway, that was kind of the idea of, you know, it's funny. You start something
[00:27:31] with certain approach of this is why it's going to be beneficial. And then ends up being beneficial
[00:27:35] in other ways. And, you know, so I can talk more about those, but there's so much to talk about with,
[00:27:43] you know, with video and real estate. I feel like there's been a big boom in it in the last year or so.
[00:27:49] So, yeah, I'll let you lead. No, I was very impressed watching the, the, the,
[00:27:59] Dunheath, or Dunbeath, yeah. Sorry, Dunbeath, the Dunbeath Castle in Scotland. I'm actually
[00:28:05] fortunate enough to go to, I'm going to Scotland next year with my father. He's a big golfer.
[00:28:09] He's been there twice already. I have not been there. And I said, you want to go back a third time
[00:28:15] because he asked, we should go to Scotland. He's getting older and he's going to do a father's
[00:28:18] centripe. And I'm so honored that he wants to go with me and, or invited me. And I said,
[00:28:24] we've been there twice. He goes, yeah, but I've only golfed there because I've really never
[00:28:28] toured the country. So we're going to do a little bit of both. But we might visit that castle.
[00:28:34] You will love it. So there's a public castle, right? That's a big area for golfing, actually.
[00:28:39] So like, Borora is one of the towns that we stayed in. There's a beautiful golf course there.
[00:28:44] And a lot of people go there specifically for golfing. So I wouldn't be, it's cahthness is the,
[00:28:48] is the area. I wouldn't be surprised if you go to that area. If you do, Dunne Robin Castle is a
[00:28:54] public castle with beautiful gardens right on the, it's just, you'll have to go there. You'll drive
[00:28:59] right by it on Highway A1. But one thing that is surprised me is the food in Scotland. It was some
[00:29:06] of the best food. We had just come from Paris. We were in the south of France. We were eating like,
[00:29:11] like kings. We went to Scotland. And the food was even better. Like it was literally,
[00:29:16] that I was not expecting. It was, it was some of the best food I've ever eaten from the, the
[00:29:22] big goods to the preserves. Like there, they have all these little, like berries and stuff. They,
[00:29:28] like on the toast every morning was like, so good. The, like, the meat was all like grass fed local.
[00:29:35] I couldn't believe how good the food was. That's crazy here.
[00:29:39] Amazing food. You're going to love it. It's not all just haggis and, um,
[00:29:43] and sausage and all of that. No, but that stuff's good too. I just, I couldn't believe how good
[00:29:48] the food was. Like I was just like expecting it not to be great. And then I was so impressed by it.
[00:29:54] That, um, yeah, anyway, um, but the, the scenery, the, like, it's so cool. I loved it there.
[00:30:01] I love it. I've done Ireland. I actually did that with my dad years ago. And, uh, you know,
[00:30:07] if Scotland's, you know, just as beautiful, more beautiful, maybe I certainly, um,
[00:30:11] you know, a place to, a place to go visit, especially for anyone who's a call for. But, uh, let's,
[00:30:16] let's talk. I want to go back to the YouTube. So you, you, you flew to Scotland. You,
[00:30:21] you got approval. You brought someone with you to help shoot. You, you know, started editing,
[00:30:26] or you hired out for the editing. And this particular video did really, really well. You have
[00:30:32] over a million views on it. And I'd love to know sort of what did that do for your channel.
[00:30:38] And also, what did that do for your exposure within the real estate industry? And also, like,
[00:30:45] did it impact the, I know I'm asking three questions at once, but, uh, it's very poor interviewing
[00:30:50] technique. But just want to hear how it impacted your business. Yeah. Sure. Um, well, there have been some,
[00:30:56] you know, we've, we have a ton of listings coming up. So that's been something where I can sort of,
[00:31:02] you know, it's something I can offer now that I'm going to put this on the channel that gets,
[00:31:06] you know, it's not so much the YouTube lately hasn't been nearly as much about your subscriber count.
[00:31:10] But it is more about kind of your momentum, your how many returning viewers you have. And it's hard
[00:31:17] to, the YouTube algorithm is that we could have a whole podcast just on that, right? Uh, but it,
[00:31:23] you know, we have, like, we have a $12 million listing coming up in downtown Brooklyn that is
[00:31:28] like a beautiful historic townhouse that is fantastic. We have, um, a nice 30,000 a month, uh,
[00:31:36] rental in Tribeca coming up, uh, another $12 million listing on, or 11 million on, uh, Fifth Avenue.
[00:31:43] Like, there's like, we have like 30 million dollars of exclusives that are coming. Uh, a lot of which
[00:31:48] have been, I think when people start to associate you with higher value stuff, it becomes easier.
[00:31:55] Like, I haven't even really been able to, like, it used to be my range. It was like three to,
[00:31:59] like, maybe even like one to five million. And it just seems like we've been getting a lot of higher
[00:32:03] end stuff. And a lot of that has been, I'm getting more comfortable with it because now I'm,
[00:32:08] I'm more comfortable walking through it, $20 million property. So I think it comes across to the,
[00:32:13] now I'm, I'm giving myself permission to go after that kind of business. And it seems to be that
[00:32:18] the reputation of me, you know, touring and, and really speaking credibly about these properties.
[00:32:25] And helping sell them really is connecting with my clients and their, or, you know, my potential
[00:32:33] clients in, in pitches and in, in marketing. And they're saying, oh yeah, he does that kind of thing.
[00:32:38] Now he just, let me give it to him in New York. So I think that being associated with it and being
[00:32:45] able to credibly speak about these properties and learning about all this. I mean, I have a,
[00:32:49] like, I need to know all the specifics of every type of stone of every, because if a million
[00:32:56] people are going to see this, I can't mess up, you know, and if I do, right? Because if the content is,
[00:33:01] I'm sorry, just going to interject, if your content in your video, is it good, YouTube knows that
[00:33:07] immediately because they, they see when people bounce out and go to another video and you're penalized
[00:33:12] for that if they bounce out too quickly, you know, they have their own algorithm to sort of keep
[00:33:16] you engaged. And if that doesn't keep you engaged, they're, they're not, they're going to devalue that
[00:33:20] video. Obviously, this value has, has, has not been devalued. So you really do have to have a,
[00:33:27] a keen eye to detail, like what's going to capture the, the audiences, the intended audiences attention
[00:33:32] and what's going to sustain their attention. And that takes a lot of planning on this. Yeah, it,
[00:33:39] definitely the, thinking about what, what's most unique and interesting about the property,
[00:33:44] what are people going to want, when they see a thumbnail, you definitely want them to click. And
[00:33:48] a lot is about your title and thumbnail course. But once they're in, they also need to be actually
[00:33:54] getting what they were offered, right? You don't, you know, you want something that's interesting
[00:34:00] and sort of teasing them, but not, you don't want to do a complete clickbait because they,
[00:34:04] you know, they're going to say, oh, this isn't what I thought it was. Or, and then they leave,
[00:34:07] and then YouTube does penalize you. So, but yeah, back to the, you know, kind of the idea of
[00:34:13] what this has done. Yeah, it's been a huge expense, right? Like, you know, to, and also just time
[00:34:18] away from the business in, you know, travel and that sort of thing. But the, in the, the branding of
[00:34:25] it, particularly with the higher end properties and kind of the international exposure has been really
[00:34:29] good. So, you know, I'm working with, you know, set of clients now that, you know, there's a lot of
[00:34:38] people who are saying, oh, I need a, you know, I need a two bedroom for my daughter who's going to
[00:34:43] school in New York, you know, New York's a global city. So it's, it's easy to get, you know, to be seen
[00:34:48] as this worldwide person. But I always try to mention in my videos and brand it to myself and say,
[00:34:53] oh, you know, in New York, we have, you know, we call it this, we have these same style of windows,
[00:34:57] or, you know, this would be worth this if it was in New York or, you know, I try to mention that,
[00:35:02] at least maybe once in the video without seeming to annoying, you know, keep mentioning New York. But
[00:35:08] I want people to know that first and foremost, I'm a New York guy, but, and they should think of me
[00:35:13] when they're thinking of New York real estate. But I'm also, you know, traveling the world and
[00:35:17] partnering with agents, you know, all around so that I could, you know, work with them on a referral
[00:35:23] basis. I mean, that's really such a such an amazing result, right? You get not only people who have
[00:35:32] opportunities locally for you or, you know, they know people that have opportunities for you locally.
[00:35:37] And then also, hey, by the way, I, you know, I see that you do this video in this other country,
[00:35:42] and maybe there's an opportunity that comes your way and obviously, you don't practice there,
[00:35:46] but now you, of course, can refer that out and, and, you know, whatever the rules are, depending,
[00:35:51] I don't know how, how every country works with that kind of commission shares. But certainly,
[00:35:57] it's something that that should be able to work. So I, and, you know, here's what I was thinking
[00:36:02] when you were telling me, and I just wanted to sort of throw this your way. And I want you to tell me
[00:36:06] if you agree or would modify this idea because I was thinking like, okay, if I was a listener,
[00:36:12] what might I do right now? And maybe I'm not going to be able to reach out to this big castle,
[00:36:20] a castle in Scotland, for example, I don't have the resources or time or, or, or energy to do that.
[00:36:25] But could I do that in my own local community? Could I pick a super high end? For example, if my goal
[00:36:31] as an agent is to get more luxury listings, or if that's one of my objectives, then I might think,
[00:36:36] okay, well, I should probably get familiar with dealing with luxury properties. Well, I don't have
[00:36:42] any luxury listings. I don't have any luxury buyers at the moment. But there's luxury listings out
[00:36:47] there that are listed by other agents. Maybe I could reach out to them and say, hey, I want to feature
[00:36:52] your listing. I'll give you credit. I'll say it's, you know, your listing. I just want to
[00:36:56] tour the property and maybe highlight a couple of really cool things. And again, I don't know what
[00:37:01] most agents would say to that. I suspect maybe they'd say, well, I just want to see the final
[00:37:05] edit before you push it out or something, something that I think. But even if, even if they end up not
[00:37:11] wanting you to actually release the video, which they probably would want you to, but even if they
[00:37:16] didn't, you know, Phil, you said something that was really hit me, which was you got familiar.
[00:37:21] Now, and comfortable dealing with these higher end properties, because you were now walking through
[00:37:26] and talking about them. And I would think even that alone would obviously increase your confidence
[00:37:31] and your competence around dealing with luxury properties, even though you might not have any
[00:37:36] yourself at that at this particular moment, you're doing a thing I would think, or, you know,
[00:37:43] and also doing, I like the drone idea too of getting a drone to sort of fly in through the
[00:37:48] window and having just a couple of cool creative ideas that, you know, drones aren't that expensive,
[00:37:53] really. I mean, you know, you can do some pretty neat stuff. But if I was an agent in a local market
[00:37:57] and I was looking to get more visibility on my videos, I would absolutely go to whatever the
[00:38:03] highest price rentals and condos and single family homes or whatever. The most unique listings
[00:38:09] out there and be like, you got to, I mean, this is cool thing. I got to show you and see what that
[00:38:14] would do. Curious on your take on that? No, I think you're right on. And I don't know one is stopping
[00:38:19] you. Like, I'm no one is stopping you and you will probably get just as the very first reach out
[00:38:27] you've never done this before. I bet as long as you're, you know, you have a little bit of experience
[00:38:32] as an agent and you can write a decent email, I bet 20 or 30% of the agents will say, okay, sure.
[00:38:37] You know, the most, the biggest thing would be convenience factor for them. Do you, you know,
[00:38:41] when I go to a property, I need at least eight hours in the property and I try to schedule two days.
[00:38:46] So long form is way different than short form. But you could, I would start with short form.
[00:38:52] There's a guy who does a great job with this. His name is Tyler Hasman and I've had him, you know,
[00:38:58] I've worked with him before, you know, he does a lot on on TikTok and he gets a lot of his business
[00:39:02] from it. And he does, the cool thing about what he does is he can go and he can shoot four or five
[00:39:07] properties in a day. And the feedback cycle is so much shorter that it's, and it's just less
[00:39:13] investment because he can edit it himself on cap cut and stuff. Now, there's a lot of agents who
[00:39:17] are doing this already. So you're kind of, you need to think about how you can do it either better
[00:39:22] or different or, you know, create a little bit more of a, of a story for it, you know, and, you know,
[00:39:30] I can't help with that. Really, you're going to have to think about it yourself, you know,
[00:39:34] listener, but I think that if you just try to get 10 or so out, you know, try to get them done.
[00:39:40] And you'll, you'll get better, you know, and then you'll get more comfortable in camera.
[00:39:44] Everything will get better because, you know, one thing that we haven't talked about yet is
[00:39:48] just, you know, I call it climbing cringe mountain and just getting over,
[00:39:53] getting over that, that, that mental sort of pit in your stomach feeling of like, oh,
[00:39:59] God, people are going to make fun of me. This is awful, you know, I listen to, there's a great
[00:40:04] video for I that I reglass a New Yorker put out. He's the host of this American life, which is a
[00:40:11] very famous radio show and podcast here, of course, in America. And it's actually a technically
[00:40:16] Chicago, but he's really a New York guy. But anyway, he, he does this video and it must have been for,
[00:40:21] you know, some sort of talk he was giving about how you have to be willing to do poor work.
[00:40:29] That's not up to your taste standards until your skilled develops to where you can match
[00:40:36] the output of the project with your taste, right? And he said, what most people do is they have
[00:40:41] good taste. They know what's good. They, and they try to create something, whether they write or
[00:40:46] they music or poet or, or, or video or whatever. And it's not up to their standards and it
[00:40:51] bums them out because they want it to be better. And they don't realize that like, that's the path
[00:40:56] is actually to just keep, keep doing it and learning and getting better. And eventually,
[00:41:02] the expectation you have matches the reality of what you're producing. And then it, and it is,
[00:41:07] in what Ira says in this video, it's like a two minute video. I'll see if I can find it and send
[00:41:11] it out to our audience. But he says, most people quit just before they're about to hit that level
[00:41:17] of competency that they're going to be in it. And then I also read a book not by, not by Mr. Beast,
[00:41:23] but I think it was his mentor. And you brought me a breaded as well. I can't remember. It's a YouTube,
[00:41:28] you know, sort of how to do YouTube book. And Mr. Beast is quoted in there. He's like number one guy.
[00:41:34] If you, if anyone doesn't know, he's number, number one channel. And I believe on YouTube. And he
[00:41:38] said his, your first hundred videos are going to be garbage. So he goes, do him as quick as,
[00:41:43] but don't do him as quick as possible. Meaning put out crap. But he goes, it's going to be crap
[00:41:47] anyway. So do your best. And don't think that it's supposed to be good. Just do your best. And he
[00:41:52] goes after your first hundred or 10 or whatever that number is. He says 100. But you know, he's a
[00:41:57] full-time YouTuber. He goes, you're going to start to get good. And he's like, you just don't quit
[00:42:02] before the good comes in. You know, and so I thought that was good advice. There's definitely,
[00:42:08] definitely some of that. I think though, I would sort of say maybe your first hundred minutes of
[00:42:14] content. Maybe because if you're, you know, if you're doing, you know, TikToks and that sort of thing,
[00:42:19] like, and they're like 30 seconds long, maybe 200 of them is like, but man, if you're doing,
[00:42:23] you're just going to quit. If you, the average person isn't Mr. Beast who will count to a million
[00:42:28] on a channel and get, you know, I mean, Mr. Beast, a lot of respect, you know, goes out to him.
[00:42:34] Sure. But I think you don't have to have that much tenacity in order to do it. I just think,
[00:42:38] because there's also, I think that, you know, if you're, especially if the kind of person who I
[00:42:45] imagine, you know, is listening is already in real estate or is, you know, is planning on being,
[00:42:51] and they're probably not going to be able to try to fully become a content creator, you know,
[00:42:57] 100%, but they're looking to augment their business with that. And so I would probably say,
[00:43:03] if you're seeing, you know, creating a lot of contents great, and I think you definitely should,
[00:43:09] and you're going to get better through it, but you should also see what works, see what green
[00:43:13] shoots you have, and see what doesn't grow and just sort of whithers and dies. And, you know,
[00:43:18] allow, don't think of, you know, what the algorithm is saying to you, but think about, if a video
[00:43:24] does better, just realize that more people liked it. It's like people, and if it doesn't do well,
[00:43:30] then it's not, it's not insult to you, but it's just that for whatever reason you lost people,
[00:43:34] or they weren't interested in the first place, and look at your last five videos,
[00:43:38] look at the one that did the best, and just think, okay, huh, study it. Why did that one do better?
[00:43:44] What other thing that's adjacent to that could I do? You know, for me, it was Castles and Chateaus,
[00:43:49] I tried doing some duplex apartments. They didn't do that well, you know, I'm still going to do
[00:43:55] some New York content and some things like that, but I guess that people are, you know, I'm,
[00:44:00] some stuff's really working out for me. I will wander from there a little bit, but not too far,
[00:44:07] until I get that, you know, until I sort of get permission by the audience video,
[00:44:12] yeah, by the audience, that it does well enough, that they're like, okay, like I want to see this.
[00:44:15] I also do, there's a cool feature on YouTube, after you get monetized, you can submit like,
[00:44:22] kind of like a poll to the audience, and I recently did one, it was like, oh, do you want to see
[00:44:25] this kind of property, or this kind of property? Do you want to see ones that haven't been renovated
[00:44:29] yet, or do you only want to see beautiful properties, you know, that are finished? So that kind of
[00:44:33] thing. And you can get feedback and view your, you know, the comments and everything as a conversation,
[00:44:38] more than just, you know, I'm going to decide what I want to do, and I'm going to put it out there,
[00:44:42] and the audience is going to have to deal with it. Well, that's probably not going to do so well,
[00:44:46] you know. Right. And probably the, often, I found in marketing that the ideas that I have that I
[00:44:53] am confident this is going to get the result that I want, whether it's a video or it's email campaign,
[00:44:59] or any sort of print or digital campaign, most of the time I'm wrong. And what's interesting is,
[00:45:06] I've learned that it's okay to be wrong, because all I have to do is listen to feedback. So
[00:45:12] you're saying this exact way is, is, you know, nothing's, or this video I thought was going to,
[00:45:18] I put a lot of work and energy, and it just didn't really get the result I wanted. Okay, well,
[00:45:23] maybe let's figure out why it didn't, and then let's, you know, move what is doing well, or what
[00:45:28] is doing better, and do more of that. And I, I, 100% agree, it's just the audience will tell you,
[00:45:34] your audience will tell you either verbally or non-verbaly. Here's what we like, and here's what we
[00:45:38] don't like, and whatever your initial vision is for the, the content may, may change as a result of that.
[00:45:46] Yeah. And within your niche, it's important to look at what someone who likes something that you
[00:45:52] like, or that you're trying to, you're trying to encourage them to give you a chance on the first
[00:45:57] one, right? Because they haven't heard of you. They don't know who you are. So what, you know,
[00:46:01] what are other people kind of like you doing already? And what do their thumbnails look like? What are
[00:46:06] their titles? You know, because if that's your front door, and if they don't open the front door,
[00:46:11] they're not going inside of the house, you know, and then they can't, you know, you can spend all
[00:46:15] this time renovating your kitchen, and then you, the front door is locked. No one's going to come in,
[00:46:19] and YouTube's going to say, oh, people don't enter that door. Don't, don't even show it to people.
[00:46:24] And then it's like, man, it's all this work. And there's a lot of, you know, a lot about Mr. Beast
[00:46:28] just talking about titles and thumbnails, titles and thumbnails. But it is kind of true that if,
[00:46:33] if it's not interesting from just a half a second look, then fewer people are just,
[00:46:40] unless they're actively seeking you out and actively wanting to look at your thing,
[00:46:43] they're probably going to ignore it, and you're probably never going to get that exposure that you
[00:46:46] want. So, you know, that's a really, and I can relate to that because we have lots,
[00:46:54] lots and lots of tens of thousands of listeners, we're very grateful for that. And thank you to
[00:46:58] everyone who's listening right now. And I've always published our, our, our podcast episodes,
[00:47:05] not just in audio, but also in video version, which we dump into our, or I don't think we've always
[00:47:10] done this, but we've done it for the last five years or so in YouTube. And we have the same
[00:47:15] thumbnail, just the title changes and we've changed the pictures. But it's the same thumbnail.
[00:47:20] It's not particularly engaging. And I've always been like,
[00:47:23] oh, my YouTube channel just is not really growing. It doesn't, it's not commensurate with the
[00:47:28] amount of listeners we have. It's like, that doesn't make sense. Oh, because again, at that first
[00:47:33] glance, that first, you know, sort of, you know, that first thumbnail, it's not that engaging. So,
[00:47:38] I probably need to go back and re, re thumbnail, all of my images and create something a little
[00:47:43] bit more compelling and see what that does for, because it is, it is something that that's really,
[00:47:50] really important is we do look at those thumbnails and make a split second decision about whether we
[00:47:54] want to engage in that content. Yeah, I, I kind of wish that it was all text based. And you could only
[00:48:01] do a title. And there was just wasn't thumbnails. But that's not the world we live in. And, you know,
[00:48:06] frankly, it's, you can now do, I mean, you can hire someone to make thumbnails, you know, for unlike
[00:48:12] Fiverr for like, you know, they'll make you thumbnails for like 10 bucks and you can make,
[00:48:16] they make you 10 and you just give them some different assets and say, what would I,
[00:48:20] what's interesting to me? And then I have what I call a thumbnail committee, which is like 20 people
[00:48:25] who are friends and content creators that I send out four or five thumbnails to. It's actually kind
[00:48:30] of a, it's a grid with different thumbnails and different titles. And I just say top two,
[00:48:35] what would you click on? And then, then I actually load it with an a slash b test in YouTube,
[00:48:42] which you can do now. And it's almost always that my little group of my thumbnail committee is
[00:48:46] correct. Like it is. Oh, kidding. Yeah. So if you just take some time with it, because if you're,
[00:48:52] I liked, you know, I view how much time people are listening to what we're watching. And
[00:48:57] a good thumbnail could do, you know, five or 10 times as many views. And that's, I mean, at this point,
[00:49:02] you know, it's like tens of thousands of hours of watch time is what we're talking about. So like,
[00:49:07] that is a full time job is two thousand and sixty hours a year. If you're working nine to five,
[00:49:15] we might be talking about, you know, several people's entire, you know, nine to five years,
[00:49:22] and it all rests on this title and thumbnail. Like, yeah, it's just, it's a crazy, it's a crazy thing.
[00:49:28] But you should give yourself permission to spend a few hours on it, because it could,
[00:49:32] it could translate into, you know, tens of thousands of hours of watch time over the course of your
[00:49:37] channel. And of, you know, if you're thinking about starting a channel, just know that you're
[00:49:42] going to have to get a little obsessive about titles and thumbnails, because basically every
[00:49:45] YouTuber is, because once all that data is in front of you, it's hard not to try to increase those
[00:49:50] percentages. Yeah. And I think videos here to stay, I, it's funny, because the vast majority of
[00:49:56] people who will absorb this content, this particular episode, is audio. And I was thinking about
[00:50:03] this the other day. I thought, why are audio podcasts still so popular? And they are, I think it's
[00:50:09] because of, of commutes and people being able to listen to audio podcasts while they're doing other
[00:50:14] things, cleaning around the house. So I'm grateful that audio hasn't completely gone away, because
[00:50:21] this podcast would probably not be as successful as just, in fact, it wouldn't be as successful as
[00:50:26] just a YouTube video channel, although I would love that to, to not be the case. I'd love to
[00:50:31] build that audience. So please subscribe on YouTube. I'll send the links out. But, but what I am,
[00:50:37] what I am really grateful for with video is video does not seem to be going away. So this idea of
[00:50:42] building that skill set, yeah, maybe audio podcasts, maybe they do end up going away at some point,
[00:50:46] and we just want to watch things going forward. I don't, I don't think so. I mean, I don't know.
[00:50:51] My point is is what video is definitely not going away, right? No, no, it's definitely not. And
[00:50:57] there's some podcasts that work really well as, you know, on YouTube, and it's becoming bigger.
[00:51:03] I think you're wise to have your, you know, you're wise to have it. But I think there's something
[00:51:07] that I've listened to so many of your episodes. And, you know, I've learned a lot of, it's
[00:51:13] really great ideas from the other people on the podcast. And I think that it's sort of like,
[00:51:19] I think of being in a podcast, like a podcast as like, sort of sitting in a room with two people
[00:51:25] who you want to listen to who were, you know, maybe, you know, hopefully, you know, maybe,
[00:51:30] like your role models or something like that. But also just an interesting conversation that you
[00:51:33] can just be a part of as you're doing the dishes or at the gym or, yeah, commuting. I spend so much
[00:51:39] time, we don't have in New York, we have to show every single time on the listing side. So,
[00:51:45] you know, I spent a lot of time commuting to my listing. So, oh, I got to show on 86th street,
[00:51:49] and I got to show down in the village. So, you know, that can be hours a day. And I just,
[00:51:54] there's so many podcasts I listen to that way. And I'm not going to watch it all. You know, there's,
[00:52:00] there's some information density of a podcast that's like, it's only audio, but you can learn,
[00:52:06] you can imagine what people look like when they're talking. You can, you know, and we were discussing
[00:52:11] before the show about how important, you know, pauses are and how important, you know, vocal tone.
[00:52:16] You convey so much information just with this and you feel like you get to know people really
[00:52:21] well by hearing their voice. So, yeah, and there's something about getting into somebody's ear versus
[00:52:28] their eyeballs that seems more intimate. And maybe it's because the, the imagination, the visual
[00:52:36] imagination takes over while you're listening to an audio podcast. You start imagining what's,
[00:52:41] what's happening. You maybe, you sort of see the conversation or the person speaking. And it feels
[00:52:47] more intimate. It's, it's not got as many blockers or, or, or gates that maybe video has. And because
[00:52:56] video, there's, there's a lot more opportunity to not like something about a video, right? We have,
[00:53:01] there's just so many different, you know, visual elements to a video that there's could be something
[00:53:07] that turns somebody off visually. And then they're just like, okay, I'm out. Whereas with audio,
[00:53:12] it's a little bit easier in that sense because all I have to do is really focus on the quality of
[00:53:16] the content, the quality of how it sounds. And so I, I do think, I do hope that that shows like this
[00:53:23] continue on, you know, for, for a long, long time because it's much easier to get an audience for
[00:53:28] me this way than on video because, you know, it's just what I do. But if I was an agent, you know,
[00:53:34] practicing then video obviously would be what I would focus on because it obviously is more
[00:53:39] tuned into our actual industry. So I love this that you, you really sort of just asked your way in
[00:53:47] to these luxury properties and just said, hey, I want to do this thing. Can I? And some, some of them
[00:53:52] said, sure, like what's the harm? It seems like a good idea. We want, you know, we want promotion.
[00:53:57] And you got more comfortable with those properties. You became more competent doing the videos on
[00:54:03] YouTube and being the host and being the, you know, the talent within the video. And then, you know,
[00:54:10] it just, it just all of a sudden now it's like, oh, Phil is this New York REALTOR because all over
[00:54:16] the world to look at these high end properties, that is a luxury brand aesthetic, I think. And, and it
[00:54:24] is absolutely brilliant because it shows that Phil really walks the talk, right? He is going into
[00:54:31] these properties. He is talking about these amazing, these amazing homes and he's able to do that for
[00:54:38] your home as well. So I just, I think it's, it's, yes, it's expensive, agreed. Yes, very expensive. And
[00:54:45] it also helps build the brand that is going to help your individual business because it legitimizes
[00:54:52] you even more so. Like I don't, I'm a global guy and, and I go all over and I do this and I just think
[00:55:00] it's one of the smartest things I've seen marketing wise for video, for an age for agents ever. So I'm so,
[00:55:07] so impressed Phil that that you have built this. I really want to remind everybody, follow,
[00:55:11] fill on YouTube, fill up, well, fill up with one out, fill up wells, wells with two wells,
[00:55:17] uh, real estate. We'll have a link to his YouTube channel in the show notes. Also you can watch him on
[00:55:21] Instagram, which is Phil Wells underscore RE linked to that as well in the show notes. Phil, I'd love to
[00:55:27] ask, you know, you've been in the business 10 years, what would you knowing what you know now?
[00:55:34] What would you say to your 10, 10 year ago self who was just starting out that would have made
[00:55:41] your journey a little bit less uncomfortable to build your real estate practice? Because again,
[00:55:47] we have to remember you were in a very uncomfortable situation. Didn't have a sphere of influence,
[00:55:51] didn't have, um, you know, the six friends you had probably weren't like, I'm ready to buy my
[00:55:56] $2 million one bedroom in the West Village. Although if you did have that amazing, most people don't.
[00:56:02] So I'm suspecting you, you know, you obviously didn't have that either. So what would you tell your,
[00:56:07] your, your 10, you know, yourself 10 years ago, uh, that would have helped because maybe this will
[00:56:12] help our listeners. Yeah, I mean, it was interesting what you said earlier about how you, you hear
[00:56:18] this a lot, you know, people who had to really have to grind. And in some ways, I, I have an agent,
[00:56:23] they're not an agent anymore. They, they had kind of an easy go of it for their first couple of
[00:56:27] years. You know, they had like you said, those friends or those, you know, friends of their parents
[00:56:31] or whatever who they did. Like, I remember I was struggling to, you know, do whatever I could
[00:56:36] and little sales and a bunch of rentals and whatever. And they came in and did like a $3.5 million
[00:56:43] dollar deal as though like first in their first month. I was like, oh man, they're going to just
[00:56:47] crush it, you know, like doing so well. And then they were, as they got smaller deals,
[00:56:54] they were all disappointing. You know, they were all like, you know, I have to work with this,
[00:56:58] you know, seven, seven hundred and fifty thousand dollar buyer or whatever. And I was like, hey,
[00:57:04] that's pretty good buyer. I'll take them, you know, and I think something about walking up,
[00:57:10] you know, walking up the ladder slowly and being comfortable and each rung is good about,
[00:57:16] you know, so I think that as long as you're moving, as long as you feel like you're getting more
[00:57:21] confidence, you're learning the market better, you know, I think in some ways, although, yeah, we've
[00:57:26] loved to, you know, climb the chain, you're a ladder faster. I think there's sort of a curse of
[00:57:31] too much too quick when it comes to real estate. So maybe you would have said to yourself, don't worry
[00:57:38] about the results not coming as quickly. They will come based on the discipline and the effort
[00:57:44] you're going to do from every single day, 10 years from now, it's all going to work out kind of thing.
[00:57:51] Is that kind of what I'm hearing is telling the younger self you are on the right path?
[00:57:55] You're on the right path. And I think that what I would, I helped a lot of agents in the past,
[00:57:59] because I sort of felt like, I'm kind of roped into helping so and so with it. Like, yes,
[00:58:04] I was seeking out opportunities, but I was also kind of like, I don't know, I was always kind of
[00:58:08] the nice guy in the office helping someone with their, you know, with the printer if it wasn't
[00:58:13] working or whatever. And I always thought I should be focusing on good and clients and building
[00:58:16] my business. And, you know, this is, this is a distraction. But in reality, the path that I had
[00:58:21] to success was and still is by helping people, as I'm building a team, by helping people and just
[00:58:27] by helping people with the printer or by, you know, someone formatting a spreadsheet for someone,
[00:58:33] or, you know, when someone's, you know, there's a lot of people who are, you know, need a little bit
[00:58:38] help at my office. And there was recently a flood in our office. And it was like going and
[00:58:43] covering people's monitors with trash cans, trash bags to make sure they didn't get wet and
[00:58:47] moving their documents and whatever. And I find that just by those small things that you do
[00:58:53] can just multiply by to the point where people are saying, hey, can I join, you know, the Marcus
[00:58:58] Wells team? And I'm like, oh my god, yeah, of course, that's amazing. Like, I can't believe you are
[00:59:03] even thinking of that. Like, you know, I'm happy to, you know, yes, I'd love you to, I'd love to
[00:59:08] start that conversation. But also, I'm happy to just keep helping you, you know, and I think that
[00:59:13] just viewing those interactions as, you know, investment stones, stepping stones, you know, it's like
[00:59:19] there's really, I always thought, you know, everyone is out for their own and it's, you know,
[00:59:24] real estate is a very cut throat. But at least within our company or with, if you can find that,
[00:59:28] you know, if it is, then go somewhere else, go to a different company where you feel supported
[00:59:33] and, you know, your manager will give you time of day and like everyone's investing in you and
[00:59:37] you're working together because there are a lot of places like that, even in New York. And I'm sure
[00:59:41] there is just make sure you're happy in the office, in the environment that you're in because it's
[00:59:46] so important. Regardless of the name on the door, it's just, it's so important to be with people
[00:59:51] that you're comfortable with and who are helping you. I have one last question because you are a fan
[00:59:57] of one of my favorite authors, Stephen Pressfield. For anyone who's not listening, Stephen Pressfield
[01:00:03] is actually a very storied author. He's written a ton of books, fiction and nonfiction. And he wrote
[01:00:11] this book, I don't know, maybe 20 years ago now or so called The War of Art, which was sort of a play
[01:00:19] of Sun zoos, The Art of War. He sort of just flipped it around and talked all about, it's a small book.
[01:00:25] It's a very quick read, but there's so much in there and it's really about basically this idea of
[01:00:31] the amateur and the professional and sort of how to become the professional because the professional,
[01:00:38] all the spoils go to the professional, the amateur has a lot of pain and failure to it. And when you
[01:00:47] make the decision to become a professional, you're moving from amateur to professional status and you're
[01:00:54] running to resistance. So those are kind of the three big things of the book is how do you overcome
[01:00:58] resistance, how do you move from amateur to professional. And it's one of these books that, and I'm
[01:01:04] sorry, I'm talking so much about it, but it really impacted my life and it was a huge seller,
[01:01:11] probably a lot of our audience knows it. Even if you're not a creative, I really encourage you to
[01:01:17] get the book because he'll talk a lot about writing because he's a writer, but it really applies to
[01:01:22] just about anything in life. And it's not specifically about writing. It's about sort of treating
[01:01:27] like, like, filled it when he first got his job at Corcoran. He sat in the office. He stayed there
[01:01:33] from nine to five. That's what a professional does. Professional stays in the office, learns. You know,
[01:01:38] he wasn't the amateur sort of doing it, sort of not doing it one foot in, one foot out. But tell
[01:01:44] me your experience with the War of Art. Yeah. Similar to yours, just a transformational, you read
[01:01:49] this book and you're like, oh, like, what I really got me was a little bit less the professional,
[01:01:55] but more the resistance because everyone has the, I always thought, just I have this feeling because
[01:02:02] I just don't really want to do it or what, you know, it's this, it's this kind of like, I don't
[01:02:08] know if you've seen Fern goalie, but it has that kind of that sort of weird, like, little monster of
[01:02:13] oil or whatever. It's like this weird darkness that you just, you know, whatever it is, if it's going
[01:02:18] for a run in the morning or if it's this, there's this feeling of resistance and he does such a good
[01:02:22] job of defining it and putting it in, you know, anyway, it's a fantastic book. I loved it. It was
[01:02:30] one of those transformational books for me and the fact that it's for both of us, I just wrote
[01:02:34] this in our email exchange because I just thought maybe you would, it would connect with you and I'm
[01:02:38] so glad it did. But what I really, there's this one story in the book that really stuck with me that
[01:02:44] I wanted to read here. Please. And it's just, he has a bunch of these little short chapters.
[01:02:51] Which is what I love about Stephen Hressfield is in particular in the War of Art and also
[01:02:55] a turning pro was a sequel, which is about becoming professional, which is also written in the same
[01:03:01] style. These are one to two page chapters. He's such a good writer that what I am amazed that he
[01:03:08] does, he's able to do as I'm verbose and I say a bunch of extraneous things that probably aren't
[01:03:14] that useful. He pulls all of the extraneous out and every sentence just hits. So I'm sorry, go ahead.
[01:03:21] Oh, yeah. So I just thought I could read this one. And yeah, if anyone's reading like, it's
[01:03:26] probably a couple hours you can read this whole book or less. It's so short and you'll just kind of
[01:03:31] want to go through it. Even if you go to a bookstore, I bet you could read it in the bookstore
[01:03:34] that even. And I don't even think that Hressfield would mind. He's like, he just seems like such a
[01:03:40] cool guy from this book that like he just really wants to like help other writers and creatives and
[01:03:44] anyway, great book. But I'll read this chapter called Largo. In my 20s, I drove tractor trailers
[01:03:52] for a company called Burton Lines in Durham, North Carolina. I wasn't very good at it.
[01:03:58] My self-destruction demons had me. Only blind luck kept me from killing myself and any other poor
[01:04:03] suckers who happened to be on the highway at the same time. It was a tough period. I was broke,
[01:04:10] a strange for my wife and my family. One night I had this dream. I was part of the crew of an
[01:04:17] aircraft carrier. Only the ship was stuck on dry land. It was still launching its jets and doing
[01:04:24] its thing, but it was marooned half a mile from the ocean. The sailors all knew how screwed up
[01:04:30] the situation was. They felt it as a keen and constant distress. The only bright spot was there
[01:04:36] was a machine gunnery sergeant on board nicknamed Largo. In the dream, it seemed like the coolest name
[01:04:43] anyone could possibly have. Largo. I loved it. Largo was one of those hardcore senior non-coms like
[01:04:49] the Bert Landcaster character, Warden, in from here to eternity. The one guy on board the ship
[01:04:56] who knew exactly what's going on, the tough old serge who makes all the decisions and who actually
[01:05:00] runs the show. But where was Largo? I was standing miserably by the rail when the captain came over
[01:05:06] and started talking to me. Even he was lost. It was his ship, but he didn't know how to get it off
[01:05:12] dry land. I was nervous finding myself in conversation with the brass and I couldn't think of a thing
[01:05:17] to say. The skipper didn't seem to notice. He just turned to me casually and said,
[01:05:23] what the hell are we going to do, Largo? I woke up, electrified. I was Largo. I was the salty old
[01:05:31] gunny. The power to take charge was in my hands. All I had to do was believe it.
[01:05:39] So that's, you know, the keeps going. But the idea that, yeah, it's all in your hands. And
[01:05:46] what I found to bring this to real estate is, you know, in New York, we have these complex transactions
[01:05:52] involving boards. And you've heard it before from other people on your show, but I think the
[01:05:57] listener probably has as well. But, you know, we always use a real estate attorney. We have,
[01:06:01] there's, when we have a closing, there's like eight people in the room. The co-op board has to accept
[01:06:05] the, yeah, the do. The person buying the home, they have to first, it's for anyone who doesn't
[01:06:11] live in New York or has a dealt with co-ops, you know, this is part of the process is the person
[01:06:15] goes in front of the board, bears their financial life as well as their sort of personality to the
[01:06:22] board and just says, Hey, I want to make sure I'm a cook. They want to make sure you're a culture fit
[01:06:27] so that you don't move in and, you know, destroy the good will of the building by being a jerk.
[01:06:34] So it is very complicated. You could have somebody who has a cash offer is going to pay right
[01:06:40] and maybe the board, the condo board goes, I don't, I don't want to like that guy.
[01:06:44] Yeah, well, it is, it's wild and anyone who wants to have a discussion about that can connect to me
[01:06:49] because it is, it's like joining a country club and you have to be financial
[01:06:53] qualified and you have to know the right people and you have to, you know, it can be a little,
[01:06:56] a little ridiculous and but with all these moving parts, sometimes, you know, it can feel like
[01:07:04] the attorneys in charge or the, you know, but as the real estate agent, something I learned is
[01:07:09] you are Largo. Like you are the one moving everything forward. You're the one who is, you know,
[01:07:15] you have to, you know, don't let anyone else drive the ship because you're driving it. And like,
[01:07:19] the assumption should always be, you know, when you have a, when you have a listing, when you have a
[01:07:23] buyer, when you are involved in a, in a deal, like, yeah, the attorney might be working on the contract
[01:07:28] but you should read every page of that contract. Like you need to be, you know, don't just, and like,
[01:07:33] if it's a title company where you are, don't just let that, like you need to be on top of every aspect
[01:07:38] of this because, you know, you're the one in charge and once you take ownership of it, your
[01:07:43] clients are going to feel it, you know, always call the client before they call you, you know, always
[01:07:48] try not to be on the defensive, try to just be proactive and you'll get a lot better results.
[01:07:53] So this Largo, you know, once you realize that you're Largo, you can do a lot better for your real estate
[01:07:58] business. And we should also mention that becoming Largo or becoming the one in charge is going to
[01:08:06] be a little bit painful. So we have to realize the only way to get better at anything is by pushing
[01:08:12] up against, you know, resistance and resistance, whether it's exercise or whether it's becoming,
[01:08:17] you know, more comfortable doing a particular type of listing or reaching out to clients and
[01:08:23] having conversations or deepening, you know, these are skills. These are all skills and they're not
[01:08:28] supposed to go perfect right away. And so the idea is if you're in a little bit of distress, if it's
[01:08:34] a little scary to put out a video or to pick up the phone and call that expired listing, good.
[01:08:41] Like the fear that you're feeling, it probably, if it's a healthy thing for you to do, you're on
[01:08:46] the right path. The fear is there to tell you it's supposed to be a little bit scary. And here's
[01:08:51] the good news over time, it'll be a lot less scary. And so I, what I try to do with fear around good
[01:08:59] ideas is I try to use the fear signal as an indicator of I'm on the right path. Fear is good.
[01:09:06] It's not fun to feel fear. I hate that I'm afraid of so many things, but I know that that's what
[01:09:11] leads me into, you know, a better quality of life. I'm pushing against my boundaries and continuing to
[01:09:18] just learn new things, but I have to be willing to deal with some of that pain. And it's short term.
[01:09:23] The good news is it's all short term that discomfort. And eventually over time, you develop
[01:09:29] competency and all of that happens. So the best time to start is now. So whatever particular skill,
[01:09:36] I hope this has been really inspiring to anyone listening. And Phil, thank you so much for your
[01:09:45] explanation of how you do video marketing and how you built your brand and the challenges along
[01:09:52] the way. And some really just amazing tactical advice for anyone out there. Really, I couldn't thank
[01:09:59] you enough on behalf of our audience. We thank Phil for spending an hour with us today. And also
[01:10:05] want to remind everybody, please, you got to see some of Phil's videos. I mean, there's a reason he's
[01:10:09] gone viral. And these videos are incredible. So Philip Wells real estate is the YouTube channel. We'll
[01:10:22] also have a link to his Instagram account, which is Phil Wells underscore RE. And he is with the
[01:10:28] Marcus Wells team, by the way, Phil is a New York City agent, also deals in different burrows.
[01:10:35] And not just Manhattan, but if you have clients that are moving in and out of New York City and are
[01:10:41] looking for a good agent, Phil would love the opportunity to connect with you to see if he might
[01:10:45] be a good option for one of your clients of Phil. What's the best way one of our listeners could
[01:10:51] connect with you if they see any synergy there? Yeah, you can definitely send me a DM on Instagram,
[01:10:57] which is great. Or you can email me. It's first initial last name, P Wells at corcorin.com.
[01:11:05] And yeah, I love when people email, it's cool to know that people heard this. And if they have
[01:11:11] any questions about, you know, I always have to hop on the phone and talk with them about YouTube
[01:11:17] or real estate, New York, you know, pretty much anything. And Phil, I think you have potentially a
[01:11:23] second career. If you if you want one, if you probably don't have time for one, oh, you definitely
[01:11:27] don't have time for one, but you could also do, I think, a lot with voice over work. I imagine you've
[01:11:33] probably heard that before. You know, what I really so much appreciate in the way you've the way
[01:11:40] you've been sort of communicating during our interview is and I really want everyone to, if you can,
[01:11:47] if you didn't pick up on this, go back and listen to how Phil responds. He's very precise.
[01:11:52] We don't hear ums and aes very often. And his sentences are short and concise and really
[01:11:58] right to the point. He cuts the fat out. Whereas me, I sort of blather on and probably need to edit
[01:12:05] myself more effectively. Phil does a great job of that. And I think that would be super helpful,
[01:12:10] not just in video making or being a podcast guest, but in talking with clients is getting
[01:12:15] really having not so much a script in front of you that you're reading from, but knowing what you
[01:12:21] want to say. Here are the five things I need to get across in this conversation. And what's the most
[01:12:26] direct way I can do that so that my client gets the answers that they want. Because as Phil said,
[01:12:33] you know, you don't ideally the client doesn't call you first with a question. You reach out. So
[01:12:38] you have to sort of know now's the time to have the conversation about XY and Z and rehearse plan.
[01:12:44] And eventually you end up just getting good at these kind of conversations. And I think Phil,
[01:12:51] your tonality, the way you speak is really, you know, something we didn't really talk about on
[01:12:57] the show. But I imagine our guests will probably give you feedback like that to say, your voice is
[01:13:03] really soothing. And that's something as well. You know, we, I don't want to get, we won't get
[01:13:07] into any of that now. But there is something to be said for everyone sort of having an awareness
[01:13:12] of how their tone comes across to other people when they communicate. And this is a skill.
[01:13:18] This can be developed. You can change part of the way you communicate. And you know, look,
[01:13:24] communication is so, so important in this business. So anyway, Phil, I, I, I, we'll have to, you know,
[01:13:30] maybe three months from now we'll do a second conversation because that's one of the things I
[01:13:34] appreciate most about your show is the, the presence that you have and sort of the musicalness of
[01:13:40] your, you know, you have, I heard something once and it said that most people use two notes when
[01:13:45] they speak. They'll talk a lot like this and then they'll talk like this and then we'll come back
[01:13:49] like this. And I forget who it was, but they, they, it was a vocal coach and they went to a piano
[01:13:55] and they played a song with just two notes and said, okay, three minutes of that, how boring was
[01:14:00] that? Then they played something with just, you know, two octaves or so. And people aren't going
[01:14:06] to listen to you if they, you know, if you just, and ever since I heard that, I've just noticed it.
[01:14:10] It's like you have to put a little bit of energy into it. Don't sound like you just woke up, you know,
[01:14:14] you know, you need to have a little bit of, and it doesn't have to be fake, but just, you know,
[01:14:20] the, I think that's one of the reasons that your podcast has been successful is because you bring,
[01:14:24] you know, energy and presence to it. And you've done enough episodes that you've definitely
[01:14:29] overcome any nerves that would, that would flatten it, you know, you don't want to, you don't want
[01:14:34] whatever you're saying to feel flat. Otherwise, people just don't believe it. Don't trust it, you
[01:14:38] know, whatever, you need to connect authentically with your, your people if it's on the phone or
[01:14:43] if it's on a podcast to, you know, 10,000 people. Yeah. And if anyone out there is, you know,
[01:14:49] really impressed with, with my podcast, please realize that my first 100 episodes of the podcast,
[01:14:56] you do not want to listen to it. I mean, actually, they're probably okay, but they're not what we're
[01:15:01] doing now. So, you know, it's that old expression from, I don't remember, it's like a zen saying,
[01:15:07] I don't know exactly where it comes from, but I think it's a zen colon or something to that effect,
[01:15:11] where it's before enlightenment, chop wood, carry water, after enlightenment, chop wood, carry water.
[01:15:17] So it's just about continuing down the path, keep doing the work. And it's, it's not, you know,
[01:15:24] it's not fun to do pushups, but they lead to bigger muscles. You know, so that's what I try to
[01:15:29] remember. And Phil, I am so grateful to have, thank you for all the kind words, by the way,
[01:15:33] that meant a lot to me. I so appreciate that. We appreciate you, the listeners as well. Phil and I
[01:15:38] thank you. We already thank Phil on behalf of the audience, but Phil and I want to thank you as well.
[01:15:42] We appreciate you. We're hope that this was helpful for you. I know that it was, but I really hope
[01:15:46] it resonated with you. Please let Phil know how much you appreciated him coming on the show.
[01:15:50] I mean, it would mean a lot to me and Phil as well. So reach out to him. Check out his YouTube channel.
[01:15:55] See what he's doing and see how you could take a, an inkling of that idea and maybe bring it to
[01:15:59] your local market and be the, become the YouTuber in your local market that maybe adds up getting
[01:16:05] people who you wouldn't normally come across in your normal spheres of influence. Also, check out
[01:16:11] Phil on, you know, Instagram and on his YouTube channel, Philip Wells real estate. You definitely

Well, thanks for having me, DJ. I'm super excited to talk with you because I, well, number one, I just got back from New York City and I have such a, well, I think most of us have such fond experiences, you know, visiting New York and I always think like if I was just a little wealthier, maybe I'd, maybe I'd live there, but, but I, I'm happy here in Chicago, but I do love visiting and so, so grateful to be able to talk to somebody because somebody who practices in New York because I think it is a really difficult market. Obviously, we know the pricing is like there, but would love to kind of go all the way back to the beginning of your story. I know you're not from originally from, from New York, but how did you get to New York? How did you start in real estate? Yeah, well, I feel like people's starting real estate is always a little bit, a little bit interesting, you know, people come, it can be a second career for some. For me, it was really a first career. I'm just hitting, you know, just over 10 years now in real estate. When I first started, I had moved to the city very much like two suitcases in a dream, just loved, loved New York and I didn't, you know, I didn't have that much of a plan besides I was helping my father at the time with a small publishing company. It wasn't a big concern, but it gave me just enough, just enough to pay basically the rent and scrape a little extra money for something else. You know, I was, I know that if you pay over 40% of your income and rent, you rent burdened. I was very rent burdened. Let's put it that way. I came out here with a couple thousand dollars in my, you know, account and two suitcases and it was a big risk, you know, but when you're in your early 20s, it's like, all right, you know, I can, I can, I can take that risk. So I found a place, I found a room that I rented in like a, you know, there was like a 10 room house that I was renting in. It was kind of a crazy place to live for a couple of months, but I, you know, kind of found my footing in New York that was way out in Bushwick and it was a cool place and I met some people, some of which we're doing real estate and they were doing, you know, rentals and rentals is a big market, you know, out in New York. So I was doing, you know, I saw what they were doing, but then I also was interested in it, but not necessarily with who, you know, with that particular company because they weren't really the most credible company. So I did what I always do in these situations, which I reached out to a bunch of people in the industry and tried to set up little, you know, one-on-ones and informational interviews. And then I met through a friend of a friend of a friend, I met someone who was working for the Corcoran Group, which at that time was one of the bigger companies and after a quick meeting with the managing broker at the Fort Green Office, Julianna Brown Deriggs, who will always have a, you know, I'll have a soft spot for her. She decided that, you know, she would take a risk on this kid from Idaho who really had no connections. Yeah, no sphere of influence, right? No sphere of influence. I knew about six people in the city and, you know, I had some sales experience, you know, from stuff I'd done in college, but I mean, that was pretty much it. I just, you know, it was one of those, I'm really happy she took a chance on me. And what she told me, which when I first started was, although this isn't a nine to five job, I want you to be in the office at nine a.m. and I want you to work more than 40 hours a week in the office. That desk over there is yours. That computer over there is yours. I want you to be here all the time that you're not out with clients. And I really took that to heart in the first year. I was just in the office learning what I could, absorbing what I could. And I really credit a lot of my early, my early deals and my early success to being in the office. I'd thank you. That's a really, I love when I hear a story like this where it's very much a similar story that I've heard a lot, but I think we can't ever hear it enough, which is, you know, there's these little foundational skills or foundational habits that we all, you know, could benefit from, whether it's, you know, exercising more or, you know, being more present in for our families or, you know, our relationships or like maybe, you know, maybe treating this like an actual job from nine to five, because I find that that is absolutely one of the most common characteristics among top producers is they treat it like it's a job. I have to be there at a certain time. I stay a certain amount of time and, and then I, I go home and you have, of course, you know, you have more for freedom than that. But I love the idea of treating it like an actual job. I suspect people would do a lot better in this business if they wet, you know, even if they wet somewhere in their own house every day from nine to five and really treated it that way. I'm curious, you know, so you're at this desk, you're, you're absorbing what you're hearing and going on, you know, within the, within the brokerage. But what are you doing actually to go grow your business? You know, you didn't have, you know, you know, you know, you six people, but what we're actually doing to move the business forward. Yeah. So at that time, there was an agent who sat across from me who was, I was learning a lot from him, who had, you know, he was a sole operator. He wasn't a member of any team or anything like that. He'd been in the business for like 30 years and I would listen a lot to him and I'd bounce ideas off of him. Uh, but yeah, boy, it was tough for the first bit. You're, we did get a certain amount of what we called floor duty. I don't know. I'm thinking of, you know, other agents. It's not as common in New York because a lot of our offices don't have a retail store front, but this one happened to. So it was in Fort Green, 65 Lafayette Avenue. I know because I wrote that so many times on handwritten, you know, letters to, you know, co-ops condos nearby townhouses. So that was one thing I was doing is I would try to get out mail just, you know, as much mail handwritten front. I don't know if it still works as much these days, but it did work that, you know, getting people to reach back out, you know, to expires, but even people who would just own for like that seven to 10 year range where, you know, if it's a one bedroom or two bedroom, they might be looking to make a move. They might be looking to rent it out. They might be, you know, so that was something I would target. I would target a little bit of rentals that were turning over just, you know, you got to imagine 11 months into a lease. They're thinking either that's it's going to move out or not. And then I had a mentor, Jean was her name and I was helping her with her listings for free. So I just said, Jean, I'm here for you, open houses, weekends, whatever, you know, help you go take photos for this listing, you know, I was just going all over. And one of the deals, she wasn't always in her office and she said I could answer her phone. So I answered her phone and my first sale came from answering an angry call that was yelling at me about. So I pick up the phone and she says, does this listing even have a dishwasher? And so well, thanks for calling today. I'm not sure which listing you're talking about. What's the address that you're looking at? 55 pineapple 2J. Well, let me look it up. You know, it's on our system. Thanks for calling Corcoran, you know, blah, blah, blah. And I ended up saying, I don't want to say her name, but I ended up saying, you know, she was looking for her son and she was frustrated because it never said in the listings. And it never said whether I'm not a dishwasher. So I told her, no matter what, we're going to find your son in a department that he's happy with. And it's going to have a dishwasher. Just use me and I'm going to take you all around the city. We're going to find this for you. And it was my first deal. And you know, it was it was a co-purchase with her and her son for 550,000 on second Avenue. And it's funny. You just remember all of the addresses and deals, you know, that you do. But that was, you know, how did I get my start? It was just grinding. I mean, there was nothing easy about the first couple of years. Yeah, it never is. It seems to be even the agents that do have more immediate success seem to still, you know, unless they're just extraordinarily fortunate, tend to grind it out for the first two to four years. And then hopefully by then it starts, you know, business starts kind of coming in a little bit more easily. So I like this. You partnered with not only did you find a place that wanted you to come into the office and sort of absorb the knowledge that was being shared inside of those walls. And then also partnering with other brokers in the office, you know, you, you, you sat across from somebody, you were able to listen to them. You were also able to for free say, hey, I will help you with your listings, you know, Mrs. or Miss broker. And you know, that is typically I find that people who are willing to do things for free, which I know is not comfortable for anybody. Nobody wants to do anything for free. Because of course we all have bills to pay. But I do find that people who are willing to do that kind of work usually succeed. I sort of not sure if there's more to that, but it seems to be the pathway to success seems to be a little bit about contribution along the way and just sort of willing to do things that maybe you know, the extra mile or going above and beyond. Well, definitely people are always agents for a very quick once you start providing value to them to say, hey, I'll give you 10% of this deal. When it closes, it could be 10 for 10, 20, I mean, you started it. I started a 10%. I started at zero. Then I went to 10%. And then I started saying, look, I'll work with you. I'll do the bulk of the work on this for 25%. Or you know, you just, but what I found is doing the math, it's probably different in New York where the commissions are higher. But you know, if I'm working on someone with a $1.1 million listing at 3% to the to the seller side, which is what we were tending to do, that's a $33,000 gross commission. 10% of that was $3,300 bucks. Then I had my own split and everything, but just talking about the GCI. Versus if they were, and the amount of work that I was, you know, say I was putting in 10 or 20 hours or 30 hours for that, well, for me, that was $100 an hour at the time, with future upside, right? Whereas if they were paying me $50 a showing, that's just not the way. I think that if you're doing that showing, this showing, you're never going to do 100 showings for an agent. But they pretty quickly will trust you and they'll, if you're working with them, it's good faith, you know, and it's, you're also going to learn from them. I just think that partnering with more senior agents in your office can be a really, that's what I'm glad I stumbled into it. But for the young agents listening now and just getting their start, that's, I think, the thing that helped me the most. I've heard it time and time again and I'm glad to hear it one more time with you because it does seem to be the pathway or at least the easier path than doing it all yourself without, you know, that kind of support and just being around people who are smarter or at least smarter within the industry or, you know, they've been experienced longer or have additional skills that you haven't yet developed is they tend to kind of rub off on you too. Like I find that, you know, just through, you know, immersion, you're there and hearing people do their pitches, hearing how they handle objections on the phone, hearing how they handle an angry client and understanding, oh, I could do that. Yeah, it's, there's so much learning that goes on that I think a lot of agents could benefit from if they spent more time with some of those senior agents. I really want to jump into your YouTube videos because this is such a unique thing that you do and it really gets me excited because after 600 plus episodes of the show, I don't get to hear too many sort of new and exciting ideas as often as I sure I would love to and what you did is very unique and it worked out really well for you and it was fun. Before we started recording Phil was starting to tell me the story and you could just see his whole face kind of lit up when he was telling how exciting this all was. So let's kind of go to the beginning of, you know, your social media marketing or your video marketing, you know, tell us how that's evolved and then we'll get to sort of, you know, the what you're doing now and how that's really accelerated the amount of visibility you have. Sure, sure. Well, I would say a lot of it. I'm actually going to credit a lot of this, the origin of this, to working with an influencer in New York, his name was Cash Jordan and he did a lot of, you probably, you might be familiar with him. Yeah, he did a lot, like almost a daily video for a long time about, you know, rental apartments or starting out with rental apartments and then he started doing a few, I started to see him do a few more higher value, higher ticket ones and I immediately reached out to him because again, I send a lot of cold emails to people just, you know, hey, you know, I see what you're doing, I support it, you know, just I always, I'm always, if I'm thinking about them for longer than five, ten minutes, I'm just going to send an email because why not reach out and if you as long as you're okay with a 10 or 20% response rate, then just reach out to people and say, you know, say hello, they'll often be supportive of what you're doing or they won't have time, but anyway, I'm always encouraging people if you're in sales, do cold reach outs. It also helps you hone that writing skill and you see what works and you see what doesn't work. Anyway, I reached out to Cash and I said, hey, we have a lot of, you know, listings right now we'd love to promote. Maybe you want to come and do a tour of something for sale, not for rent. It's right near this one, you just did one on 55th Street, this is on 56th Street. Let's take a look. So he would, he reached right back out and he's like, yeah, I'd love to do that. Let's schedule it for a couple of weeks from now. So after doing, you know, one, two, three, ten, twelve of these with him on his YouTube channel, I started to see the power of it. I actually got someone to reach out directly to me saying, hey, you know, me and my wife were looking for an apartment and I said, oh, okay, hold on, hold on, hold on. You know, because they said it seems like you would do a lot of work in this neighborhood. It seems like you do a lot of work. So I said, and a lot of people in the comments said that Phil should have his own channel and I was starting to say, maybe I should, maybe I should, but it just seemed like a whole nother, as the business was increasing and as we were starting to put a team together, it seemed like a lot to do. So I was a little intimidated by it. I didn't do anything for six months and then I thought, you know what? I got to do something here. So I started doing Instagram videos, shorter form, tick-tock, all the stuff that everyone else is kind of doing and I wasn't getting a lot of traction with it. And then I started from kind of from scratch thinking, what could I do that's so different, so much bigger that people would have to watch. They'd just be like, you know, what's really, really, really interesting. And I started with what's really interesting to me, which is like these grand castles and shadows and like, you know, high dollar things, but not just like a inesil mazer type of like Beverly Hills type of home, but something that's like historic and, you know, just dramatic and really cool. And then I saw Dunbeath Castle, which is the one that you, I think you said, you saw this, this castle in Scotland. And I tried my approach. I reached out to them and I said, you know, hey, here's what I'd like to do. Here's what I'm proposing. I'll fly over there with my crew and everything and, you know, it'll be kind of similar to this that I've done, but it's going to be even higher quality. And didn't hear back for a couple of weeks. Didn't really think anything of it. But my birthday was coming up and I had a birthday trip that I wanted to go, I wanted to go to Europe. I kind of wanted to do this anyway. So I reached out to a bunch of other, I was like, well, if I can't get that one, I'm going to try to get this one, this one, this one, this one, this one, this one, this one, I reached out to about 10 more. And then DJ, something happened that got me a little kind of freak me out a little bit. All of them started getting back to me like two weeks later and they all started saying yes. I was like, oh, I know. I have like free publicity. Sure. We'll take that. Yeah. And like, you're going to produce like a 10 to 20 minute video on our property. You're going to pay for everything. You're going to fly over here. Like, great. Let's do it. You're going to do it for free. So then I had to like back pedal a little bit and say, okay, I could do these. Maybe I can do a trip. I can do one a day. You know, I can do like four. And I didn't realize what I was getting involved in as far as the, you know, the scripting, the editing, the, you know, just the sheer amount of work that one 20 minute video takes. You know, you think, oh, you know, I'm going to record it. That'll take maybe one day. I can probably edit it in a week. Get it out there. Get it done. I learned it's a little more than that. But, you know, it's, they started performing. They started doing pretty well. And it got really exciting to see that, you know, to see, you know, you're, it was 10 times the effort, but it was getting a thousand times the results, which is, wow. What was really cool. And so how much time would you estimate you spent on some of those videos each, you know, being that you thought, well, probably take a week. And also we should mention your full time REALTOR too. So this isn't something that you're doing as your only sort of, you know, thing marketing, I think. So how long did it actually, does it actually take you to edit a 20 minute video? Yeah. So I was surprised that a professional editor will take, you know, about two hours per minute of finished product, something like that. So when you're budgeting editing time, you know, that would, I always thought this stupid three minute video just took me eight hours to edit. I must be an idiot. You know, it must be, when I was trying it on, on DaVinci or whatever myself, there's a lot of good free editing software that you can use now. There's a ton of good, you know, if you have the time, if you're a new agent, you have the time to learn editing, not only can you probably start editing for other agents and charge and make a side business out of that, but you get, there's so many good ways of learning it just by watching, you know, tutorials on YouTube and that sort of thing. So I would encourage people who have an interest in that to do it, but I would not necessarily encourage a new, an agent who has an existing bit of business to think that it's only going to be just make sure you budget the time needed for it. And boy, is it depressing when you put something out that only gets, you know, a thousand views or whatever and you've put so much time, you know, so how long does it take? I, because I, I was really, I hired the editing out. So, you know, I was, you know, how much of the cut, you know, probably, you know, it could be on the low end, you know, one to two thousand per video of a, you know, on the high end, depending maybe five thousand, you know, so they, but I was hiring, you know, pretty good editors, you know, that, and I wasn't afraid of some investment in this project, because I thought it would have not necessarily that it would come back in the form of like ad revenue, but I thought it would come back, you know, if I get one client and I generate 50,000 in GCI off it, you know, it, okay, it's paid for the whole project and it increases the brand value and everything. So, but then again, you know, it, it also, what really encouraged me towards this whole project in the first place was getting more listings because of what I could offer new clients. So we just, I'll say more about that. Well, we just, so what I noticed is we tend to get a lot of our really good closing ratio for our pitch ratio. So, you know, if we go on my partner Pam and I do a really good presentation in person, you know, and I think that there's something about our presentation that, you know, I come in, I'm kind of the ideas guy, I have a lot of, you know, here's eight things we can do that no one else has done, you know, from artistic renderings of, you know, the room is, you know, to coming in with renovation ideas to, you know, painting and staging and, but then, you know, hiring a drone that is pretty tough to do in New York because of the airspace stuff, you know, a drone that will open the window and it'll fly into the apartment and it'll, you know, just a little razzle dazzle that a lot of other agents just don't do. And I think that it's not that one idea will totally sell the person on us, but it's that we're bringing energy and enthusiasm to a listing that otherwise, you know, it might just be someone who's just going to take photos and do a floor plan and put it up on, you know, on our equivalent of Zillow. And anyway, one thing that I kept getting and hearing from clients is that they're interested in video way more than when I started, you know, in the industry, that wasn't really a thing. And I just kept hearing it more and more. And I was like, you know what? I guess I'm going to have to become an expert in video just so that we can close more pitches. You know, we can close get more listings. And so that was kind of where I started with the going back to cash Jordan. There were several listings where I said, look, we're going to get this featured. We're going to get 500,000 views on this property. And it, you know, we've already seen results with it, but it's really, it's going to help, right? And we're going to bring cash Jordan in. And so we did. And, you know, he knew that that helped us, you know, he was doing well with, you know, with ad revenue and everything. And he also owned a real estate company. So it was helping him. It was helping us. But eventually I knew that, you know, you don't want to, you don't want to build your house on land that you rent, right? You want to, you kind of want your own platform. You want your own thing. And ultimately, I'm glad I did because he sort of, he's been doing more news-based content lately. And so, you know, it would have been bad if I was 100% relying on his distribution. Sure. So anyway, that was kind of the idea of, you know, it's funny. You start something with certain approach of this is why it's going to be beneficial. And then ends up being beneficial in other ways. And, you know, so I can talk more about those, but there's so much to talk about with, you know, with video and real estate. I feel like there's been a big boom in it in the last year or so. So, yeah, I'll let you lead. No, I was very impressed watching the, the, the, Dunheath, or Dunbeath, yeah. Sorry, Dunbeath, the Dunbeath Castle in Scotland. I'm actually fortunate enough to go to, I'm going to Scotland next year with my father. He's a big golfer. He's been there twice already. I have not been there. And I said, you want to go back a third time because he asked, we should go to Scotland. He's getting older and he's going to do a father's centripe. And I'm so honored that he wants to go with me and, or invited me. And I said, we've been there twice. He goes, yeah, but I've only golfed there because I've really never toured the country. So we're going to do a little bit of both. But we might visit that castle. You will love it. So there's a public castle, right? That's a big area for golfing, actually. So like, Borora is one of the towns that we stayed in. There's a beautiful golf course there. And a lot of people go there specifically for golfing. So I wouldn't be, it's cahthness is the, is the area. I wouldn't be surprised if you go to that area. If you do, Dunne Robin Castle is a public castle with beautiful gardens right on the, it's just, you'll have to go there. You'll drive right by it on Highway A1. But one thing that is surprised me is the food in Scotland. It was some of the best food. We had just come from Paris. We were in the south of France. We were eating like, like kings. We went to Scotland. And the food was even better. Like it was literally, that I was not expecting. It was, it was some of the best food I've ever eaten from the, the big goods to the preserves. Like there, they have all these little, like berries and stuff. They, like on the toast every morning was like, so good. The, like, the meat was all like grass fed local. I couldn't believe how good the food was. That's crazy here. Amazing food. You're going to love it. It's not all just haggis and, um, and sausage and all of that. No, but that stuff's good too. I just, I couldn't believe how good the food was. Like I was just like expecting it not to be great. And then I was so impressed by it. That, um, yeah, anyway, um, but the, the scenery, the, like, it's so cool. I loved it there. I love it. I've done Ireland. I actually did that with my dad years ago. And, uh, you know, if Scotland's, you know, just as beautiful, more beautiful, maybe I certainly, um, you know, a place to, a place to go visit, especially for anyone who's a call for. But, uh, let's, let's talk. I want to go back to the YouTube. So you, you, you flew to Scotland. You, you got approval. You brought someone with you to help shoot. You, you know, started editing, or you hired out for the editing. And this particular video did really, really well. You have over a million views on it. And I'd love to know sort of what did that do for your channel. And also, what did that do for your exposure within the real estate industry? And also, like, did it impact the, I know I'm asking three questions at once, but, uh, it's very poor interviewing technique. But just want to hear how it impacted your business. Yeah. Sure. Um, well, there have been some, you know, we've, we have a ton of listings coming up. So that's been something where I can sort of, you know, it's something I can offer now that I'm going to put this on the channel that gets, you know, it's not so much the YouTube lately hasn't been nearly as much about your subscriber count. But it is more about kind of your momentum, your how many returning viewers you have. And it's hard to, the YouTube algorithm is that we could have a whole podcast just on that, right? Uh, but it, you know, we have, like, we have a $12 million listing coming up in downtown Brooklyn that is like a beautiful historic townhouse that is fantastic. We have, um, a nice 30,000 a month, uh, rental in Tribeca coming up, uh, another $12 million listing on, or 11 million on, uh, Fifth Avenue. Like, there's like, we have like 30 million dollars of exclusives that are coming. Uh, a lot of which have been, I think when people start to associate you with higher value stuff, it becomes easier. Like, I haven't even really been able to, like, it used to be my range. It was like three to, like, maybe even like one to five million. And it just seems like we've been getting a lot of higher end stuff. And a lot of that has been, I'm getting more comfortable with it because now I'm, I'm more comfortable walking through it, $20 million property. So I think it comes across to the, now I'm, I'm giving myself permission to go after that kind of business. And it seems to be that the reputation of me, you know, touring and, and really speaking credibly about these properties. And helping sell them really is connecting with my clients and their, or, you know, my potential clients in, in pitches and in, in marketing. And they're saying, oh yeah, he does that kind of thing. Now he just, let me give it to him in New York. So I think that being associated with it and being able to credibly speak about these properties and learning about all this. I mean, I have a, like, I need to know all the specifics of every type of stone of every, because if a million people are going to see this, I can't mess up, you know, and if I do, right? Because if the content is, I'm sorry, just going to interject, if your content in your video, is it good, YouTube knows that immediately because they, they see when people bounce out and go to another video and you're penalized for that if they bounce out too quickly, you know, they have their own algorithm to sort of keep you engaged. And if that doesn't keep you engaged, they're, they're not, they're going to devalue that video. Obviously, this value has, has, has not been devalued. So you really do have to have a, a keen eye to detail, like what's going to capture the, the audiences, the intended audiences attention and what's going to sustain their attention. And that takes a lot of planning on this. Yeah, it, definitely the, thinking about what, what's most unique and interesting about the property, what are people going to want, when they see a thumbnail, you definitely want them to click. And a lot is about your title and thumbnail course. But once they're in, they also need to be actually getting what they were offered, right? You don't, you know, you want something that's interesting and sort of teasing them, but not, you don't want to do a complete clickbait because they, you know, they're going to say, oh, this isn't what I thought it was. Or, and then they leave, and then YouTube does penalize you. So, but yeah, back to the, you know, kind of the idea of what this has done. Yeah, it's been a huge expense, right? Like, you know, to, and also just time away from the business in, you know, travel and that sort of thing. But the, in the, the branding of it, particularly with the higher end properties and kind of the international exposure has been really good. So, you know, I'm working with, you know, set of clients now that, you know, there's a lot of people who are saying, oh, I need a, you know, I need a two bedroom for my daughter who's going to school in New York, you know, New York's a global city. So it's, it's easy to get, you know, to be seen as this worldwide person. But I always try to mention in my videos and brand it to myself and say, oh, you know, in New York, we have, you know, we call it this, we have these same style of windows, or, you know, this would be worth this if it was in New York or, you know, I try to mention that, at least maybe once in the video without seeming to annoying, you know, keep mentioning New York. But I want people to know that first and foremost, I'm a New York guy, but, and they should think of me when they're thinking of New York real estate. But I'm also, you know, traveling the world and partnering with agents, you know, all around so that I could, you know, work with them on a referral basis. I mean, that's really such a such an amazing result, right? You get not only people who have opportunities locally for you or, you know, they know people that have opportunities for you locally. And then also, hey, by the way, I, you know, I see that you do this video in this other country, and maybe there's an opportunity that comes your way and obviously, you don't practice there, but now you, of course, can refer that out and, and, you know, whatever the rules are, depending, I don't know how, how every country works with that kind of commission shares. But certainly, it's something that that should be able to work. So I, and, you know, here's what I was thinking when you were telling me, and I just wanted to sort of throw this your way. And I want you to tell me if you agree or would modify this idea because I was thinking like, okay, if I was a listener, what might I do right now? And maybe I'm not going to be able to reach out to this big castle, a castle in Scotland, for example, I don't have the resources or time or, or, or energy to do that. But could I do that in my own local community? Could I pick a super high end? For example, if my goal as an agent is to get more luxury listings, or if that's one of my objectives, then I might think, okay, well, I should probably get familiar with dealing with luxury properties. Well, I don't have any luxury listings. I don't have any luxury buyers at the moment. But there's luxury listings out there that are listed by other agents. Maybe I could reach out to them and say, hey, I want to feature your listing. I'll give you credit. I'll say it's, you know, your listing. I just want to tour the property and maybe highlight a couple of really cool things. And again, I don't know what most agents would say to that. I suspect maybe they'd say, well, I just want to see the final edit before you push it out or something, something that I think. But even if, even if they end up not wanting you to actually release the video, which they probably would want you to, but even if they didn't, you know, Phil, you said something that was really hit me, which was you got familiar. Now, and comfortable dealing with these higher end properties, because you were now walking through and talking about them. And I would think even that alone would obviously increase your confidence and your competence around dealing with luxury properties, even though you might not have any yourself at that at this particular moment, you're doing a thing I would think, or, you know, and also doing, I like the drone idea too of getting a drone to sort of fly in through the window and having just a couple of cool creative ideas that, you know, drones aren't that expensive, really. I mean, you know, you can do some pretty neat stuff. But if I was an agent in a local market and I was looking to get more visibility on my videos, I would absolutely go to whatever the highest price rentals and condos and single family homes or whatever. The most unique listings out there and be like, you got to, I mean, this is cool thing. I got to show you and see what that would do. Curious on your take on that? No, I think you're right on. And I don't know one is stopping you. Like, I'm no one is stopping you and you will probably get just as the very first reach out you've never done this before. I bet as long as you're, you know, you have a little bit of experience as an agent and you can write a decent email, I bet 20 or 30% of the agents will say, okay, sure. You know, the most, the biggest thing would be convenience factor for them. Do you, you know, when I go to a property, I need at least eight hours in the property and I try to schedule two days. So long form is way different than short form. But you could, I would start with short form. There's a guy who does a great job with this. His name is Tyler Hasman and I've had him, you know, I've worked with him before, you know, he does a lot on on TikTok and he gets a lot of his business from it. And he does, the cool thing about what he does is he can go and he can shoot four or five properties in a day. And the feedback cycle is so much shorter that it's, and it's just less investment because he can edit it himself on cap cut and stuff. Now, there's a lot of agents who are doing this already. So you're kind of, you need to think about how you can do it either better or different or, you know, create a little bit more of a, of a story for it, you know, and, you know, I can't help with that. Really, you're going to have to think about it yourself, you know, listener, but I think that if you just try to get 10 or so out, you know, try to get them done. And you'll, you'll get better, you know, and then you'll get more comfortable in camera. Everything will get better because, you know, one thing that we haven't talked about yet is just, you know, I call it climbing cringe mountain and just getting over, getting over that, that, that mental sort of pit in your stomach feeling of like, oh, God, people are going to make fun of me. This is awful, you know, I listen to, there's a great video for I that I reglass a New Yorker put out. He's the host of this American life, which is a very famous radio show and podcast here, of course, in America. And it's actually a technically Chicago, but he's really a New York guy. But anyway, he, he does this video and it must have been for, you know, some sort of talk he was giving about how you have to be willing to do poor work. That's not up to your taste standards until your skilled develops to where you can match the output of the project with your taste, right? And he said, what most people do is they have good taste. They know what's good. They, and they try to create something, whether they write or they music or poet or, or, or video or whatever. And it's not up to their standards and it bums them out because they want it to be better. And they don't realize that like, that's the path is actually to just keep, keep doing it and learning and getting better. And eventually, the expectation you have matches the reality of what you're producing. And then it, and it is, in what Ira says in this video, it's like a two minute video. I'll see if I can find it and send it out to our audience. But he says, most people quit just before they're about to hit that level of competency that they're going to be in it. And then I also read a book not by, not by Mr. Beast, but I think it was his mentor. And you brought me a breaded as well. I can't remember. It's a YouTube, you know, sort of how to do YouTube book. And Mr. Beast is quoted in there. He's like number one guy. If you, if anyone doesn't know, he's number, number one channel. And I believe on YouTube. And he said his, your first hundred videos are going to be garbage. So he goes, do him as quick as, but don't do him as quick as possible. Meaning put out crap. But he goes, it's going to be crap anyway. So do your best. And don't think that it's supposed to be good. Just do your best. And he goes after your first hundred or 10 or whatever that number is. He says 100. But you know, he's a full-time YouTuber. He goes, you're going to start to get good. And he's like, you just don't quit before the good comes in. You know, and so I thought that was good advice. There's definitely, definitely some of that. I think though, I would sort of say maybe your first hundred minutes of content. Maybe because if you're, you know, if you're doing, you know, TikToks and that sort of thing, like, and they're like 30 seconds long, maybe 200 of them is like, but man, if you're doing, you're just going to quit. If you, the average person isn't Mr. Beast who will count to a million on a channel and get, you know, I mean, Mr. Beast, a lot of respect, you know, goes out to him. Sure. But I think you don't have to have that much tenacity in order to do it. I just think, because there's also, I think that, you know, if you're, especially if the kind of person who I imagine, you know, is listening is already in real estate or is, you know, is planning on being, and they're probably not going to be able to try to fully become a content creator, you know, 100%, but they're looking to augment their business with that. And so I would probably say, if you're seeing, you know, creating a lot of contents great, and I think you definitely should, and you're going to get better through it, but you should also see what works, see what green shoots you have, and see what doesn't grow and just sort of whithers and dies. And, you know, allow, don't think of, you know, what the algorithm is saying to you, but think about, if a video does better, just realize that more people liked it. It's like people, and if it doesn't do well, then it's not, it's not insult to you, but it's just that for whatever reason you lost people, or they weren't interested in the first place, and look at your last five videos, look at the one that did the best, and just think, okay, huh, study it. Why did that one do better? What other thing that's adjacent to that could I do? You know, for me, it was Castles and Chateaus, I tried doing some duplex apartments. They didn't do that well, you know, I'm still going to do some New York content and some things like that, but I guess that people are, you know, I'm, some stuff's really working out for me. I will wander from there a little bit, but not too far, until I get that, you know, until I sort of get permission by the audience video, yeah, by the audience, that it does well enough, that they're like, okay, like I want to see this. I also do, there's a cool feature on YouTube, after you get monetized, you can submit like, kind of like a poll to the audience, and I recently did one, it was like, oh, do you want to see this kind of property, or this kind of property? Do you want to see ones that haven't been renovated yet, or do you only want to see beautiful properties, you know, that are finished? So that kind of thing. And you can get feedback and view your, you know, the comments and everything as a conversation, more than just, you know, I'm going to decide what I want to do, and I'm going to put it out there, and the audience is going to have to deal with it. Well, that's probably not going to do so well, you know. Right. And probably the, often, I found in marketing that the ideas that I have that I am confident this is going to get the result that I want, whether it's a video or it's email campaign, or any sort of print or digital campaign, most of the time I'm wrong. And what's interesting is, I've learned that it's okay to be wrong, because all I have to do is listen to feedback. So you're saying this exact way is, is, you know, nothing's, or this video I thought was going to, I put a lot of work and energy, and it just didn't really get the result I wanted. Okay, well, maybe let's figure out why it didn't, and then let's, you know, move what is doing well, or what is doing better, and do more of that. And I, I, 100% agree, it's just the audience will tell you, your audience will tell you either verbally or non-verbaly. Here's what we like, and here's what we don't like, and whatever your initial vision is for the, the content may, may change as a result of that. Yeah. And within your niche, it's important to look at what someone who likes something that you like, or that you're trying to, you're trying to encourage them to give you a chance on the first one, right? Because they haven't heard of you. They don't know who you are. So what, you know, what are other people kind of like you doing already? And what do their thumbnails look like? What are their titles? You know, because if that's your front door, and if they don't open the front door, they're not going inside of the house, you know, and then they can't, you know, you can spend all this time renovating your kitchen, and then you, the front door is locked. No one's going to come in, and YouTube's going to say, oh, people don't enter that door. Don't, don't even show it to people. And then it's like, man, it's all this work. And there's a lot of, you know, a lot about Mr. Beast just talking about titles and thumbnails, titles and thumbnails. But it is kind of true that if, if it's not interesting from just a half a second look, then fewer people are just, unless they're actively seeking you out and actively wanting to look at your thing, they're probably going to ignore it, and you're probably never going to get that exposure that you want. So, you know, that's a really, and I can relate to that because we have lots, lots and lots of tens of thousands of listeners, we're very grateful for that. And thank you to everyone who's listening right now. And I've always published our, our, our podcast episodes, not just in audio, but also in video version, which we dump into our, or I don't think we've always done this, but we've done it for the last five years or so in YouTube. And we have the same thumbnail, just the title changes and we've changed the pictures. But it's the same thumbnail. It's not particularly engaging. And I've always been like, oh, my YouTube channel just is not really growing. It doesn't, it's not commensurate with the amount of listeners we have. It's like, that doesn't make sense. Oh, because again, at that first glance, that first, you know, sort of, you know, that first thumbnail, it's not that engaging. So, I probably need to go back and re, re thumbnail, all of my images and create something a little bit more compelling and see what that does for, because it is, it is something that that's really, really important is we do look at those thumbnails and make a split second decision about whether we want to engage in that content. Yeah, I, I kind of wish that it was all text based. And you could only do a title. And there was just wasn't thumbnails. But that's not the world we live in. And, you know, frankly, it's, you can now do, I mean, you can hire someone to make thumbnails, you know, for unlike Fiverr for like, you know, they'll make you thumbnails for like 10 bucks and you can make, they make you 10 and you just give them some different assets and say, what would I, what's interesting to me? And then I have what I call a thumbnail committee, which is like 20 people who are friends and content creators that I send out four or five thumbnails to. It's actually kind of a, it's a grid with different thumbnails and different titles. And I just say top two, what would you click on? And then, then I actually load it with an a slash b test in YouTube, which you can do now. And it's almost always that my little group of my thumbnail committee is correct. Like it is. Oh, kidding. Yeah. So if you just take some time with it, because if you're, I liked, you know, I view how much time people are listening to what we're watching. And a good thumbnail could do, you know, five or 10 times as many views. And that's, I mean, at this point, you know, it's like tens of thousands of hours of watch time is what we're talking about. So like, that is a full time job is two thousand and sixty hours a year. If you're working nine to five, we might be talking about, you know, several people's entire, you know, nine to five years, and it all rests on this title and thumbnail. Like, yeah, it's just, it's a crazy, it's a crazy thing. But you should give yourself permission to spend a few hours on it, because it could, it could translate into, you know, tens of thousands of hours of watch time over the course of your channel. And of, you know, if you're thinking about starting a channel, just know that you're going to have to get a little obsessive about titles and thumbnails, because basically every YouTuber is, because once all that data is in front of you, it's hard not to try to increase those percentages. Yeah. And I think videos here to stay, I, it's funny, because the vast majority of people who will absorb this content, this particular episode, is audio. And I was thinking about this the other day. I thought, why are audio podcasts still so popular? And they are, I think it's because of, of commutes and people being able to listen to audio podcasts while they're doing other things, cleaning around the house. So I'm grateful that audio hasn't completely gone away, because this podcast would probably not be as successful as just, in fact, it wouldn't be as successful as just a YouTube video channel, although I would love that to, to not be the case. I'd love to build that audience. So please subscribe on YouTube. I'll send the links out. But, but what I am, what I am really grateful for with video is video does not seem to be going away. So this idea of building that skill set, yeah, maybe audio podcasts, maybe they do end up going away at some point, and we just want to watch things going forward. I don't, I don't think so. I mean, I don't know. My point is is what video is definitely not going away, right? No, no, it's definitely not. And there's some podcasts that work really well as, you know, on YouTube, and it's becoming bigger. I think you're wise to have your, you know, you're wise to have it. But I think there's something that I've listened to so many of your episodes. And, you know, I've learned a lot of, it's really great ideas from the other people on the podcast. And I think that it's sort of like, I think of being in a podcast, like a podcast as like, sort of sitting in a room with two people who you want to listen to who were, you know, maybe, you know, hopefully, you know, maybe, like your role models or something like that. But also just an interesting conversation that you can just be a part of as you're doing the dishes or at the gym or, yeah, commuting. I spend so much time, we don't have in New York, we have to show every single time on the listing side. So, you know, I spent a lot of time commuting to my listing. So, oh, I got to show on 86th street, and I got to show down in the village. So, you know, that can be hours a day. And I just, there's so many podcasts I listen to that way. And I'm not going to watch it all. You know, there's, there's some information density of a podcast that's like, it's only audio, but you can learn, you can imagine what people look like when they're talking. You can, you know, and we were discussing before the show about how important, you know, pauses are and how important, you know, vocal tone. You convey so much information just with this and you feel like you get to know people really well by hearing their voice. So, yeah, and there's something about getting into somebody's ear versus their eyeballs that seems more intimate. And maybe it's because the, the imagination, the visual imagination takes over while you're listening to an audio podcast. You start imagining what's, what's happening. You maybe, you sort of see the conversation or the person speaking. And it feels more intimate. It's, it's not got as many blockers or, or, or gates that maybe video has. And because video, there's, there's a lot more opportunity to not like something about a video, right? We have, there's just so many different, you know, visual elements to a video that there's could be something that turns somebody off visually. And then they're just like, okay, I'm out. Whereas with audio, it's a little bit easier in that sense because all I have to do is really focus on the quality of the content, the quality of how it sounds. And so I, I do think, I do hope that that shows like this continue on, you know, for, for a long, long time because it's much easier to get an audience for me this way than on video because, you know, it's just what I do. But if I was an agent, you know, practicing then video obviously would be what I would focus on because it obviously is more tuned into our actual industry. So I love this that you, you really sort of just asked your way in to these luxury properties and just said, hey, I want to do this thing. Can I? And some, some of them said, sure, like what's the harm? It seems like a good idea. We want, you know, we want promotion. And you got more comfortable with those properties. You became more competent doing the videos on YouTube and being the host and being the, you know, the talent within the video. And then, you know, it just, it just all of a sudden now it's like, oh, Phil is this New York REALTOR because all over the world to look at these high end properties, that is a luxury brand aesthetic, I think. And, and it is absolutely brilliant because it shows that Phil really walks the talk, right? He is going into these properties. He is talking about these amazing, these amazing homes and he's able to do that for your home as well. So I just, I think it's, it's, yes, it's expensive, agreed. Yes, very expensive. And it also helps build the brand that is going to help your individual business because it legitimizes you even more so. Like I don't, I'm a global guy and, and I go all over and I do this and I just think it's one of the smartest things I've seen marketing wise for video, for an age for agents ever. So I'm so, so impressed Phil that that you have built this. I really want to remind everybody, follow, fill on YouTube, fill up, well, fill up with one out, fill up wells, wells with two wells, uh, real estate. We'll have a link to his YouTube channel in the show notes. Also you can watch him on Instagram, which is Phil Wells underscore RE linked to that as well in the show notes. Phil, I'd love to ask, you know, you've been in the business 10 years, what would you knowing what you know now? What would you say to your 10, 10 year ago self who was just starting out that would have made your journey a little bit less uncomfortable to build your real estate practice? Because again, we have to remember you were in a very uncomfortable situation. Didn't have a sphere of influence, didn't have, um, you know, the six friends you had probably weren't like, I'm ready to buy my $2 million one bedroom in the West Village. Although if you did have that amazing, most people don't. So I'm suspecting you, you know, you obviously didn't have that either. So what would you tell your, your, your 10, you know, yourself 10 years ago, uh, that would have helped because maybe this will help our listeners. Yeah, I mean, it was interesting what you said earlier about how you, you hear this a lot, you know, people who had to really have to grind. And in some ways, I, I have an agent, they're not an agent anymore. They, they had kind of an easy go of it for their first couple of years. You know, they had like you said, those friends or those, you know, friends of their parents or whatever who they did. Like, I remember I was struggling to, you know, do whatever I could and little sales and a bunch of rentals and whatever. And they came in and did like a $3.5 million dollar deal as though like first in their first month. I was like, oh man, they're going to just crush it, you know, like doing so well. And then they were, as they got smaller deals, they were all disappointing. You know, they were all like, you know, I have to work with this, you know, seven, seven hundred and fifty thousand dollar buyer or whatever. And I was like, hey, that's pretty good buyer. I'll take them, you know, and I think something about walking up, you know, walking up the ladder slowly and being comfortable and each rung is good about, you know, so I think that as long as you're moving, as long as you feel like you're getting more confidence, you're learning the market better, you know, I think in some ways, although, yeah, we've loved to, you know, climb the chain, you're a ladder faster. I think there's sort of a curse of too much too quick when it comes to real estate. So maybe you would have said to yourself, don't worry about the results not coming as quickly. They will come based on the discipline and the effort you're going to do from every single day, 10 years from now, it's all going to work out kind of thing. Is that kind of what I'm hearing is telling the younger self you are on the right path? You're on the right path. And I think that what I would, I helped a lot of agents in the past, because I sort of felt like, I'm kind of roped into helping so and so with it. Like, yes, I was seeking out opportunities, but I was also kind of like, I don't know, I was always kind of the nice guy in the office helping someone with their, you know, with the printer if it wasn't working or whatever. And I always thought I should be focusing on good and clients and building my business. And, you know, this is, this is a distraction. But in reality, the path that I had to success was and still is by helping people, as I'm building a team, by helping people and just by helping people with the printer or by, you know, someone formatting a spreadsheet for someone, or, you know, when someone's, you know, there's a lot of people who are, you know, need a little bit help at my office. And there was recently a flood in our office. And it was like going and covering people's monitors with trash cans, trash bags to make sure they didn't get wet and moving their documents and whatever. And I find that just by those small things that you do can just multiply by to the point where people are saying, hey, can I join, you know, the Marcus Wells team? And I'm like, oh my god, yeah, of course, that's amazing. Like, I can't believe you are even thinking of that. Like, you know, I'm happy to, you know, yes, I'd love you to, I'd love to start that conversation. But also, I'm happy to just keep helping you, you know, and I think that just viewing those interactions as, you know, investment stones, stepping stones, you know, it's like there's really, I always thought, you know, everyone is out for their own and it's, you know, real estate is a very cut throat. But at least within our company or with, if you can find that, you know, if it is, then go somewhere else, go to a different company where you feel supported and, you know, your manager will give you time of day and like everyone's investing in you and you're working together because there are a lot of places like that, even in New York. And I'm sure there is just make sure you're happy in the office, in the environment that you're in because it's so important. Regardless of the name on the door, it's just, it's so important to be with people that you're comfortable with and who are helping you. I have one last question because you are a fan of one of my favorite authors, Stephen Pressfield. For anyone who's not listening, Stephen Pressfield is actually a very storied author. He's written a ton of books, fiction and nonfiction. And he wrote this book, I don't know, maybe 20 years ago now or so called The War of Art, which was sort of a play of Sun zoos, The Art of War. He sort of just flipped it around and talked all about, it's a small book. It's a very quick read, but there's so much in there and it's really about basically this idea of the amateur and the professional and sort of how to become the professional because the professional, all the spoils go to the professional, the amateur has a lot of pain and failure to it. And when you make the decision to become a professional, you're moving from amateur to professional status and you're running to resistance. So those are kind of the three big things of the book is how do you overcome resistance, how do you move from amateur to professional. And it's one of these books that, and I'm sorry, I'm talking so much about it, but it really impacted my life and it was a huge seller, probably a lot of our audience knows it. Even if you're not a creative, I really encourage you to get the book because he'll talk a lot about writing because he's a writer, but it really applies to just about anything in life. And it's not specifically about writing. It's about sort of treating like, like, filled it when he first got his job at Corcoran. He sat in the office. He stayed there from nine to five. That's what a professional does. Professional stays in the office, learns. You know, he wasn't the amateur sort of doing it, sort of not doing it one foot in, one foot out. But tell me your experience with the War of Art. Yeah. Similar to yours, just a transformational, you read this book and you're like, oh, like, what I really got me was a little bit less the professional, but more the resistance because everyone has the, I always thought, just I have this feeling because I just don't really want to do it or what, you know, it's this, it's this kind of like, I don't know if you've seen Fern goalie, but it has that kind of that sort of weird, like, little monster of oil or whatever. It's like this weird darkness that you just, you know, whatever it is, if it's going for a run in the morning or if it's this, there's this feeling of resistance and he does such a good job of defining it and putting it in, you know, anyway, it's a fantastic book. I loved it. It was one of those transformational books for me and the fact that it's for both of us, I just wrote this in our email exchange because I just thought maybe you would, it would connect with you and I'm so glad it did. But what I really, there's this one story in the book that really stuck with me that I wanted to read here. Please. And it's just, he has a bunch of these little short chapters. Which is what I love about Stephen Hressfield is in particular in the War of Art and also a turning pro was a sequel, which is about becoming professional, which is also written in the same style. These are one to two page chapters. He's such a good writer that what I am amazed that he does, he's able to do as I'm verbose and I say a bunch of extraneous things that probably aren't that useful. He pulls all of the extraneous out and every sentence just hits. So I'm sorry, go ahead. Oh, yeah. So I just thought I could read this one. And yeah, if anyone's reading like, it's probably a couple hours you can read this whole book or less. It's so short and you'll just kind of want to go through it. Even if you go to a bookstore, I bet you could read it in the bookstore that even. And I don't even think that Hressfield would mind. He's like, he just seems like such a cool guy from this book that like he just really wants to like help other writers and creatives and anyway, great book. But I'll read this chapter called Largo. In my 20s, I drove tractor trailers for a company called Burton Lines in Durham, North Carolina. I wasn't very good at it. My self-destruction demons had me. Only blind luck kept me from killing myself and any other poor suckers who happened to be on the highway at the same time. It was a tough period. I was broke, a strange for my wife and my family. One night I had this dream. I was part of the crew of an aircraft carrier. Only the ship was stuck on dry land. It was still launching its jets and doing its thing, but it was marooned half a mile from the ocean. The sailors all knew how screwed up the situation was. They felt it as a keen and constant distress. The only bright spot was there was a machine gunnery sergeant on board nicknamed Largo. In the dream, it seemed like the coolest name anyone could possibly have. Largo. I loved it. Largo was one of those hardcore senior non-coms like the Bert Landcaster character, Warden, in from here to eternity. The one guy on board the ship who knew exactly what's going on, the tough old serge who makes all the decisions and who actually runs the show. But where was Largo? I was standing miserably by the rail when the captain came over and started talking to me. Even he was lost. It was his ship, but he didn't know how to get it off dry land. I was nervous finding myself in conversation with the brass and I couldn't think of a thing to say. The skipper didn't seem to notice. He just turned to me casually and said, what the hell are we going to do, Largo? I woke up, electrified. I was Largo. I was the salty old gunny. The power to take charge was in my hands. All I had to do was believe it. So that's, you know, the keeps going. But the idea that, yeah, it's all in your hands. And what I found to bring this to real estate is, you know, in New York, we have these complex transactions involving boards. And you've heard it before from other people on your show, but I think the listener probably has as well. But, you know, we always use a real estate attorney. We have, there's, when we have a closing, there's like eight people in the room. The co-op board has to accept the, yeah, the do. The person buying the home, they have to first, it's for anyone who doesn't live in New York or has a dealt with co-ops, you know, this is part of the process is the person goes in front of the board, bears their financial life as well as their sort of personality to the board and just says, Hey, I want to make sure I'm a cook. They want to make sure you're a culture fit so that you don't move in and, you know, destroy the good will of the building by being a jerk. So it is very complicated. You could have somebody who has a cash offer is going to pay right and maybe the board, the condo board goes, I don't, I don't want to like that guy. Yeah, well, it is, it's wild and anyone who wants to have a discussion about that can connect to me because it is, it's like joining a country club and you have to be financial qualified and you have to know the right people and you have to, you know, it can be a little, a little ridiculous and but with all these moving parts, sometimes, you know, it can feel like the attorneys in charge or the, you know, but as the real estate agent, something I learned is you are Largo. Like you are the one moving everything forward. You're the one who is, you know, you have to, you know, don't let anyone else drive the ship because you're driving it. And like, the assumption should always be, you know, when you have a, when you have a listing, when you have a buyer, when you are involved in a, in a deal, like, yeah, the attorney might be working on the contract but you should read every page of that contract. Like you need to be, you know, don't just, and like, if it's a title company where you are, don't just let that, like you need to be on top of every aspect of this because, you know, you're the one in charge and once you take ownership of it, your clients are going to feel it, you know, always call the client before they call you, you know, always try not to be on the defensive, try to just be proactive and you'll get a lot better results. So this Largo, you know, once you realize that you're Largo, you can do a lot better for your real estate business. And we should also mention that becoming Largo or becoming the one in charge is going to be a little bit painful. So we have to realize the only way to get better at anything is by pushing up against, you know, resistance and resistance, whether it's exercise or whether it's becoming, you know, more comfortable doing a particular type of listing or reaching out to clients and having conversations or deepening, you know, these are skills. These are all skills and they're not supposed to go perfect right away. And so the idea is if you're in a little bit of distress, if it's a little scary to put out a video or to pick up the phone and call that expired listing, good. Like the fear that you're feeling, it probably, if it's a healthy thing for you to do, you're on the right path. The fear is there to tell you it's supposed to be a little bit scary. And here's the good news over time, it'll be a lot less scary. And so I, what I try to do with fear around good ideas is I try to use the fear signal as an indicator of I'm on the right path. Fear is good. It's not fun to feel fear. I hate that I'm afraid of so many things, but I know that that's what leads me into, you know, a better quality of life. I'm pushing against my boundaries and continuing to just learn new things, but I have to be willing to deal with some of that pain. And it's short term. The good news is it's all short term that discomfort. And eventually over time, you develop competency and all of that happens. So the best time to start is now. So whatever particular skill, I hope this has been really inspiring to anyone listening. And Phil, thank you so much for your explanation of how you do video marketing and how you built your brand and the challenges along the way. And some really just amazing tactical advice for anyone out there. Really, I couldn't thank you enough on behalf of our audience. We thank Phil for spending an hour with us today. And also want to remind everybody, please, you got to see some of Phil's videos. I mean, there's a reason he's gone viral. And these videos are incredible. So Philip Wells real estate is the YouTube channel. We'll also have a link to his Instagram account, which is Phil Wells underscore RE. And he is with the Marcus Wells team, by the way, Phil is a New York City agent, also deals in different burrows. And not just Manhattan, but if you have clients that are moving in and out of New York City and are looking for a good agent, Phil would love the opportunity to connect with you to see if he might be a good option for one of your clients of Phil. What's the best way one of our listeners could connect with you if they see any synergy there? Yeah, you can definitely send me a DM on Instagram, which is great. Or you can email me. It's first initial last name, P Wells at corcorin.com. And yeah, I love when people email, it's cool to know that people heard this. And if they have any questions about, you know, I always have to hop on the phone and talk with them about YouTube or real estate, New York, you know, pretty much anything. And Phil, I think you have potentially a second career. If you if you want one, if you probably don't have time for one, oh, you definitely don't have time for one, but you could also do, I think, a lot with voice over work. I imagine you've probably heard that before. You know, what I really so much appreciate in the way you've the way you've been sort of communicating during our interview is and I really want everyone to, if you can, if you didn't pick up on this, go back and listen to how Phil responds. He's very precise. We don't hear ums and aes very often. And his sentences are short and concise and really right to the point. He cuts the fat out. Whereas me, I sort of blather on and probably need to edit myself more effectively. Phil does a great job of that. And I think that would be super helpful, not just in video making or being a podcast guest, but in talking with clients is getting really having not so much a script in front of you that you're reading from, but knowing what you want to say. Here are the five things I need to get across in this conversation. And what's the most direct way I can do that so that my client gets the answers that they want. Because as Phil said, you know, you don't ideally the client doesn't call you first with a question. You reach out. So you have to sort of know now's the time to have the conversation about XY and Z and rehearse plan. And eventually you end up just getting good at these kind of conversations. And I think Phil, your tonality, the way you speak is really, you know, something we didn't really talk about on the show. But I imagine our guests will probably give you feedback like that to say, your voice is really soothing. And that's something as well. You know, we, I don't want to get, we won't get into any of that now. But there is something to be said for everyone sort of having an awareness of how their tone comes across to other people when they communicate. And this is a skill. This can be developed. You can change part of the way you communicate. And you know, look, communication is so, so important in this business. So anyway, Phil, I, I, I, we'll have to, you know, maybe three months from now we'll do a second conversation because that's one of the things I appreciate most about your show is the, the presence that you have and sort of the musicalness of your, you know, you have, I heard something once and it said that most people use two notes when they speak. They'll talk a lot like this and then they'll talk like this and then we'll come back like this. And I forget who it was, but they, they, it was a vocal coach and they went to a piano and they played a song with just two notes and said, okay, three minutes of that, how boring was that? Then they played something with just, you know, two octaves or so. And people aren't going to listen to you if they, you know, if you just, and ever since I heard that, I've just noticed it. It's like you have to put a little bit of energy into it. Don't sound like you just woke up, you know, you know, you need to have a little bit of, and it doesn't have to be fake, but just, you know, the, I think that's one of the reasons that your podcast has been successful is because you bring, you know, energy and presence to it. And you've done enough episodes that you've definitely overcome any nerves that would, that would flatten it, you know, you don't want to, you don't want whatever you're saying to feel flat. Otherwise, people just don't believe it. Don't trust it, you know, whatever, you need to connect authentically with your, your people if it's on the phone or if it's on a podcast to, you know, 10,000 people. Yeah. And if anyone out there is, you know, really impressed with, with my podcast, please realize that my first 100 episodes of the podcast, you do not want to listen to it. I mean, actually, they're probably okay, but they're not what we're doing now. So, you know, it's that old expression from, I don't remember, it's like a zen saying, I don't know exactly where it comes from, but I think it's a zen colon or something to that effect, where it's before enlightenment, chop wood, carry water, after enlightenment, chop wood, carry water. So it's just about continuing down the path, keep doing the work. And it's, it's not, you know, it's not fun to do pushups, but they lead to bigger muscles. You know, so that's what I try to remember. And Phil, I am so grateful to have, thank you for all the kind words, by the way, that meant a lot to me. I so appreciate that. We appreciate you, the listeners as well. Phil and I thank you. We already thank Phil on behalf of the audience, but Phil and I want to thank you as well. We appreciate you.
