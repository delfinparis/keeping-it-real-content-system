[00:01:35] Today's episode is brought to you by corded.io. Are you looking for agents to join your brokerage or team? Now, as a real estate recruiter, I can tell you the answer is always yes. But most agents aren't looking to move right now. So, how do you know who to contact? Well, what if I were to tell you there's a recruiting and retention tool powered by artificial intelligence that shows you exactly which agents in your local market are looking to leave their brokerage right now and which agents at your own market?
[00:02:05] And firm are also looking to leave you. Now, I've been recruiting REALTORS for 15 years and I've hired over 2000 agents. I can tell you with no exaggeration, this is the tool I've been waiting for.
[00:02:16] Corded's AI looks for trends across dozens of variables for each agent in your market and shows you which agents they believe are likely to move. Not only does it do that, but corded's AI went and visited my recruiting website and read everything I offer. So now when I'm recruiting, corded's AI tells me exactly what to say based on that agent's needs and what my brokerage can offer. It even writes emails for me. I've never seen anything like it and I use it every single day.
[00:02:45] Now, if you are looking to grow your brokerage, corded.io is the best tool out there. Visit corded.io to schedule a demo again. That's corded.io and now onto the show.

[00:04:22] All right, without further ado, let's get to my great conversation with Cassidy Eklund.
[00:04:40] Today in our rising star series is Cassidy Eklund from RE/MAX, New Horizons, Realty in Central and Northern Wisconsin. I want to tell you why we decided to have Cassidy on the show as our rising star.
[00:04:55] Cassidy Eklund is a real estate agent at RE/MAX, New Horizons, Realty in Price County, Wisconsin. Now prior to becoming a real estate agent, which by the way, she became one in October of 2023.
[00:05:06] She was a regional member at a local title company. Now it's been her dream to apply her prior knowledge to her real estate career. And she is married to her amazing husband and has two small children.
[00:05:18] In her free time, she enjoys both fishing, spending time with family and helping her community. I want everybody to follow Cassidy on her Facebook page. I will we'll have a link to that.
[00:05:30] You can friend her on Facebook and see all the cool stuff she's into Cassidy. Welcome to the show.
[00:05:36] Yeah, thank you. I'm happy to be here.
[00:05:38] I was very excited to learn that Ryan Landers is part of the area that you service because not only did I go to camp there, but my sister went to camp in a place nearby in Managua.
[00:05:51] So funny enough, I know a little bit about your area, but only I think I was only there when I was in fourth, fifth and sixth grade. So it's been it's been some time that I've been to Ryan Lander, but it is a beautiful part of Wisconsin.
[00:06:03] Just gorgeous. I remember just amazing amazing stuff. So all right. I you're doing some amazing things early on in a I would say a difficult not only a difficult time to be a real estate agent, but also not a tremendous amount of opportunity in your area just based on population.
[00:06:25] It's not a, you know, there's nothing wrong with your areas. Awesome. It's just not super highly populated. So you are doing some insane things and I want to tell our audience about that. But before we get to how you're kicking butt out there in your first year, which is amazing.
[00:06:39] I want to hear your story. So you came from the title world. So tell us about why that how that prompted you to get into real estate.
[00:06:48] So working in title, you know, you cut your checks to everybody and I was like, oh man, every closing is kind of a slap into things.
[00:06:56] You're like, they get so they get this much.
[00:06:59] Yeah, yeah, and I absolutely loved working in title. Honestly, like if this never works out, that's exactly where I'm going back to.
[00:07:08] Yeah, it was I was the CNA for a lot of years before I got into title. So it was just kind of like an ad on a feed that I went for and ended up working there.
[00:07:17] And then I just fell in love with real estate and you're working in title. You build relationships with all the real tours in your area, all the lenders, local, non local, like pretty much anybody within a tool radius.
[00:07:28] I probably talked to them or done business with them at one point. So it's just it was really nice getting to know people and then learning like what they do.
[00:07:37] And then I just kind of branched off from there and decided to become a real estate agent.
[00:07:41] So let me let me understand. And by the way, full disclosure, I'm a part owner in a title company and I don't even understand title.
[00:07:47] So that's kind of embarrassing to admit, but we're not here to talk about title anyway. But what what what I do want to know about your experience at title is you got to see how agents acted.
[00:07:58] You got to see their behavior. You got to see who in your local community was able to get deals closed. You were also able to see what they charged.
[00:08:08] You're also able to see what the what the lenders, how the lenders performed in their behavior.
[00:08:14] So you got this really in depth knowledge of like who's doing it a certain way, who's doing it a different way, who's most effective.
[00:08:21] And let's talk about that like that's incredible knowledge for to have.
[00:08:25] Yeah, yeah, it's coming handy, especially when you're buyers who aren't pre approved yet and they want contacts, you know, you know, which lenders you send an email to and they don't go back to you for four days or which ones work nights, the million, at six o'clock at night.
[00:08:40] Yeah, it's been amazing and not only that, but you also see like what lenders charge for loan fees. So every lender they charge a different amount and closing fees.
[00:08:50] So that that's been incredible. And you know, you have your ones who they keep pushing out closing, pushing out closing, wanting more from the buyers. So you get to pin down who those are and you get some really good contacts and get close to your local lenders.
[00:09:03] So yeah, it was really just amazing building those relationships before I got into this and carrying it all over.
[00:09:09] So for our listeners, here is not a terrible idea to consider find out, you know, you if you're listening to this, you have closed deals, which means you've probably worked with a title company.
[00:09:20] If you're in a state that does that and well, there's always title, but you know, depending on if you go through attorneys or not every state's a little bit different there.
[00:09:27] But if you are able to talk to reps at title companies, they know all this stuff. They know the lenders who get deals closed to charge the least. They know the lenders that charge more and maybe don't work as hard or certainly more difficult to work with.
[00:09:42] This is a great place to learn from them so that you as the agent, you know, you are more confident, reaching saying to your clients, especially your buyers.
[00:09:52] Hey, I, I'm friends with some of the title reps in our area. I know who's really actually good. Everybody says they're good, but I know who's actually good.
[00:10:01] And I'm going to get you that. And I imagine, Cassidy, like, that's an amazing thing to bring to a buyer that separates you from a lot of other agents right there.
[00:10:08] You have this sort of like behind the scenes knowledge that you can bring to your buyers and say, you know what, here's the best lender. Like you have confidence that you know, basically the best lenders in your area.
[00:10:18] Yeah, yeah, exactly. And honestly, all throughout Wisconsin, because in my area, it's a lot of people buying Blake houses or, you know, second properties hunting land, that kind of stuff.
[00:10:30] So I would have people who would use their local lenders all around Wisconsin, Illinois, Michigan, Minnesota all over the place. So not only just within a tour radius, but all over the place.
[00:10:41] So I love it. And this is the first time we've ever had a REALTOR on who was previously a title, you know, title rep. And so this is really, really cool stuff. I love the fact that you had this knowledge and you go, wait a minute, I can apply this knowledge to become a REALTOR because now I know things that most REALTORS don't know.
[00:11:01] Yeah.
[00:11:02] But I want to also talk about making the switch because, you know, people see you in one career and it's related to real estate, but it's not necessarily they see you as a REALTOR, they see you as somebody to help them, you know, get the title closed or part of the transaction.
[00:11:17] So when you made that switch, how did you start, what was your plan to make sure that people now saw you as a REALTOR as opposed to a title first. And by the way, we should mention, I'm sorry, let me mention for a while.
[00:11:31] Cassidy was doing both basically both full time. So she was still working at the title company. In fact, was April of was it last year when you decided to go full time.
[00:11:40] Yeah, yeah, per so she hasn't even been doing this full time a year. So we're going to talk about her numbers in a minute, which is insane. But sorry, back to my question. So people see you as a title person, you're still working at the title company.
[00:11:51] Was that difficult to get people to now look at you as as a real estate agent.
[00:11:58] It was, yeah, I think in the beginning, you know, when I was working both jobs, they mostly saw me as, you know, Cassidy in title and I wasn't really fully applying myself to real estate.
[00:12:09] Some of my local REALTORS, they weren't too happy that I would imagine they're not.
[00:12:16] So I am glad that I branched out and decided to do this full time. But yeah, I mean, now everything is perfectly fine. I have really good relationships with everybody else still because, you know, I worked, I was there for three years, built these relationships with all these different REALTORS.
[00:12:32] And now that has made communication with everybody so much better because I had all the relationships beforehand, not like, hey, I have this transaction with John Smith, have you done a deal with them? Do you know what he's like?
[00:12:44] Like that kind of thing, you know, who everybody is.
[00:12:47] Well, that's also super helpful too, because you know which REALTORS play nice with others. You've seen it firsthand. You know, which REALTORS can be more challenging.
[00:12:56] And so when you're getting, if you're working with, you know, a buyer or a seller and you see the agent on the other side of the deal, you can then say to your client, I know so and so.
[00:13:05] And I mean, you're in a smaller community where there aren't thousands of thousands of REALTORS, so you probably would know everyone anyway, but you really know how they work.
[00:13:12] And so you have the ability to say this person is going to get our help get our deal closed or this person can be, you know, maybe wouldn't say challenging, but you know they're challenging.
[00:13:20] And then you can take additional steps to determine, you know what you want to do. So this knowledge is really, really important. I love that.
[00:13:27] So we should talk about your numbers because, you know, the fact that you came from the title industry is really cool and certainly gave you this awareness of the industry, but it doesn't necessarily translate to sales.
[00:13:40] Like it doesn't mean just because you know that you were able to actually close deals, but you have closed deals.
[00:13:45] So let's talk about last year, 2024, which we'll just call it your first actual year in the business, but again, not going full time until basically may.
[00:13:55] So are April or May. So what did you do in your first year?
[00:13:59] First year, I had about 30 transactions closer so and got close to 4 million in sales. So.
[00:14:08] That's pretty amazing. 30 say roughly 30 sales and 4 million and we should also mention that what's just to give us an example, what is the average price point in your area?
[00:14:19] Average price point is probably about 250, 250,000 or so.
[00:14:24] Yep, I love it. So you have to close quite a few sales to get to that number, which you did. Now for anybody to close 30 sales in any given year is pretty impressive.
[00:14:35] You did it in year one. And yes, you had this background knowledge of, you know, what lenders work well, which other agents, you know, how they work.
[00:14:44] How did you actually find these clients?
[00:14:47] So a lot of them were generated leads that are provided through my office, which was really nice.
[00:14:54] And then it was really just like word amount, you know, you deal with a lot of people who regularly use the title company for like first sale by owners and that kind of stuff.
[00:15:04] So you kind of drop your name like, hey, I'm getting real estate. I know you're not working with REALTOR if you ever need anybody, just let me know.
[00:15:10] So that that helped me out quite a bit. I got a few clients that way and then also I kind of do I try to think of different ways to advertise in unique ways.
[00:15:22] So I did like a photo shoot with my children where I was showing them a little plastic playhouse and had a professional photographer take the pictures and have them sit at a table and sign a paper that said, deed at the top.
[00:15:34] And did like a little photo shoot with them and I've got a lot of feedback on that, which was it was really fun. And yeah, that was that was great.
[00:15:41] So I posted that on Facebook. Otherwise, if most of it's been advertising on Facebook posting my listings on Facebook, you get, you know, 20 people that say that message you on one listing.
[00:15:52] If that's not the property for them, I say, OK, if this one's not the one, let's find you the right one. And then I end up getting a lot of buyers that way.
[00:15:59] Wow, that's that's amazing. So just by posting a just listed or just sold or whatever, you get people that interact with you in Facebook. And then you're able to say, Hey, I have access to everything, not just this one home.
[00:16:14] Let's talk. Let's find out what you're looking for because this may or may not be the right place, but I've got access to everything. So I got some other ideas for you.
[00:16:21] Yeah, yeah, thanks Ashley.
[00:16:23] I love that. And so, you know, let's let's dive a little bit into into sort of, you know, yes, you got some leads from from your company, which is great.
[00:16:34] But you also did most of it on your own, which is, which is really incredible. You know, I want to talk a little bit about sort of the size of your market. So how many total REALTORS are there in your area? Just guess, you know, it asked them.
[00:16:48] I would say in the county, maybe 25 30 right. So that's she didn't say now here in Chicago, we have, including the suburbs, 46,000 REALTORS to give people a sort of a, you know, an idea of how it's different in a big metropolitan city like Chicago.
[00:17:04] So she's in a really small area. Everybody knows everybody, of course. And she's able to pull 30 transactions in her first year with inner, you know, being being a, well, not even a full time REALTOR.
[00:17:17] So this is a pretty incredible thing. So what you're doing is amazing. I want to ask you, what are you doing to keep the momentum going? So how are you building your business now?
[00:17:28] I am working on doing different types of mailings, different types of advertising, like dropping stuff off at local businesses for people to pick up as they're stopping in with my business card attached to it.
[00:17:40] No funny sign. I try to throw you where I'm almost everything that I do because people get a kick out of that.
[00:17:45] Yeah, otherwise it's just keeping base with all of my past clients. I treat everybody like they're my grandma pretty much.
[00:17:54] I that yeah, I try to keep in touch go to dinner with people just so you're kind of always in the back their head.
[00:18:01] So once somebody closes, you'll still continue to hang out with them, call them from time to time, maybe might him to dinner.
[00:18:08] Yes, you have exactly.
[00:18:11] Gotcha, that's that's really cool. Now I want to ask about dropping off things at your local businesses because that's something I don't hear a lot of agents talk about.
[00:18:19] So yes, they're local merchants, businesses that you you like in your area. What kind of things are you leaving there for people to take and you know how do you approach the you know the owner of the of the you know the retail shop or whatever it is and say, hey, I'd like to do put my stuff here.
[00:18:36] Yeah, so one of them that I've done is dropping off like a pile of business cards at a drink store nutritional drink store.
[00:18:43] And I'm a regular customer there. So I knew we're in a personal level. You know everybody when population is only 14,000 in the whole entire county. So, um, yeah, otherwise I'm working on one right now where I'm putting together little bags filled with one has like dog treats and I have like 500 big spade up.
[00:19:03] And then I have one where I'm doing little cat mice toys in separate bags of the business card attached to them all and I'm going to drop them off at like human societies and that clinics and also donate like separate stuff for the animals that are already there.
[00:19:18] So you know donating and saying, hey, do you mind if I put this up there. It usually they're not going to tell you know.
[00:19:24] Yeah, I love that. I mean, you're a hustler. I love that you're thinking about where do my clients go or where do my future clients go. Where are they hang out? Where are they getting pets and you know you can even go to pet food stores possibly a do the same thing right.
[00:19:39] And so you have this you have this thought of where do my clients hang out and how can I not I'm not going to be I can't hang out there with them at all times.
[00:19:47] But how can I be there when I'm not there basically and so you're doing things like you know little treats and I love that that is that is really that is I don't know anyone I've done this show for seven years.
[00:19:59] I don't know anyone that's actually shared with me that exact strategy. So thank you for sharing that our audience. So basically our audience think about a merchant that you have a relationship with in your local area and think about what you could do to help them.
[00:20:12] Maybe you put a fish bowl in there and you're like, Hey, I give away a free lunch once a week or once a month or whatever. Drop your business card and you know something simple like that. It could be even that or if you want to go a step further think of an item of value that you could give to the to the customer.
[00:20:29] And or something you can do for the merchant maybe you're like, Hey, I'm going to promote your business. I'm going to put you on Facebook all the time or I'm going to you know I'll give him a coupon or something there's all sorts of cool things you can do and partner with local businesses that I think a lot of agents just don't think about doing.
[00:20:47] Yeah, yeah, exactly and I'm trying to think out of the box and try to find things that most agents don't typically do.
[00:20:56] Yeah, so let's talk about your sort of your transition again. So you transition from title agent to real estate agent and now you're doing deals you know left and right you're getting business.
[00:21:11] And so what are your goals for this year like what would you like to do in production how many deals do you think you can do that kind of thing.
[00:21:19] I would like to times my sales from last year by about 1.5 so I'm looking to get about 45 sales and then get like 6000 very 6 million I mean sorry about that.
[00:21:35] That's pretty amazing and at some point you're going to be in team building mode because you are going to hit you're going to hit a limit and you're going to hit it soon.
[00:21:44] And so at some point we really think about what Cassie's doing she's building this amazing pipeline to get her to this high number of transactions and then she's going to say I need a partner or maybe not maybe you can do it all yourself.
[00:21:56] I love that though you are you are really crushing it. What advice if you were a brand new REALTOR starting out in a you know not obviously not your market but a different market and what what do you what would you tell a new agent to do or any agent that's struggling right now that doesn't have any business.
[00:22:15] I would tell them to go out to your local businesses and make friends with whoever you can once you make that relationship you can not pursue use that but you can you can kind of combine and go on marketing together for instance like hey if you give me a pile of your business cards I'll put them in my office give them out to clients could be a contractor's office something like that and then in return you can say hey if I could just you know leave a pile here something like that.
[00:22:43] Or you got to try to think of places that would be willing to send referrals your way like for example a title company make friends with your title agents because I can't tell you how many times they get the phone calls hey I'm looking to buy property there I don't know who to call for a REALTOR who would you recommend I got that call so many times when I worked in title and I actually do that to this day as a REALTOR if I tried to do my referrals out to RE/MAX agents because I'm a RE/MAX agent.
[00:23:13] But if there's no RE/MAX agents in that area the title company is the first people that I call so make friends with your title company.
[00:23:21] Now one of the really the one of the benefits of working I want to switch gears to talk about what can go wrong in a transaction because as somebody who worked in the title industry you've seen every sort of disaster happen in a transaction so let's talk about how that knowledge really helps you get deals close faster because from what I understand you're constantly thinking about what you're doing.
[00:23:43] So I'm thinking about what could go wrong right now and so talk about that process.
[00:23:47] Yeah, yeah, so it's exactly what you said like I whenever I'm drafting documents writing an offer if there's anything that's out of the ordinary the first thing I say to myself is how can this go wrong.
[00:23:59] For example if a seller's leaving personal property on property until after closing let's say it's a it's a camper in the yard.
[00:24:06] And they want to leave it here because we have three feet of snow or something and they live out of state they're not coming up until summer.
[00:24:15] I make sure like I say what can go wrong here and then I go to thinking about when the ground thoughts and everything is a wet mushy mess.
[00:24:25] You pull on a camper through a yard that's going to create ruts so you need to put in there that any damage to the lawn or driveway needs to be repaired by X state have a deadline for when those people need to come and get their stuff.
[00:24:39] If there's any damage buyers aren't responsible for that seller needs to get that fixed so just it really makes you think what what can happen here and also easements there's a lot of general easements out there that don't show up.
[00:24:54] So in the state what happens if this culvert goes out because it's on the easement and it's on this other property to on the subject property.
[00:25:03] So when there's something that's on both of their properties or there's not a written driveway agreement in place where it states who is responsible for repairs that stuff needs to be specified before closing just in case something would happen.
[00:25:17] So you just kind of always tell yourself what can go wrong.
[00:25:22] And I guess a title company is a great place to learn that you know I know you had mentioned if you were starting out in real estate you might start out in title again if you were to do it all over again you might do it the exact same way because the knowledge you gained was great now for everyone listening who's already a REALTOR you're probably not going to stop doing that to work in title.
[00:25:43] But I think the idea of budding up with a title person and becoming their best friend and you know doing something nice for them and then saying hey I want to learn from you I want to learn what can go wrong and a transaction as an agent what do you wish agents knew before they got to the closing table you know this is stuff that Cassidy already knows but this is knowledge that anybody can really learn if you develop good relationships.
[00:26:09] Yeah yeah exactly and another thing to you know working in title you're sitting there you're going through loan docs you're talking with the customers a lot of times like REALTOR is they'll come in and they'll look at the closing statement at the closing table and they'll say oh like we're we're missing something.
[00:26:29] It's nice to have that knowledge ahead of time because if it's a massive on title I'm more likely to catch that when I review it ahead of time rather than be not working in title and not even knowing what to look for.
[00:26:40] So I know what fees they charge I know what should be on that closing statement I know what fees the lenders want on that closing statement so it just makes you overlook everything a second time and make sure that everything is good.
[00:26:53] Now I've bought several properties in my life and I'm in this business and I still whenever I close I'm always like do I need to do I need to bring money to like I never know what what I'm going like it's always it's always a mystery right like the day before my attorney or something will be like okay you need to bring a check or you don't need to bring a check and I never know what it is I just trust everyone's working in my best interest but the reality of it is somebody does need to know that and what you have you know almost to the penny.
[00:27:23] What somebody's going to what a closing is going to look like and I will tell you as somebody that is in this business but also not really an agent I mean I'm technically one but I don't practice so I'm think of me as just like an average person on the street who doesn't really know the business I know what's going on with closings and by the way again I partner in a title company I truthfully know a whole lot about it and it's embarrassing but but it's true so I need this information and I have a hard time getting it you were able to go to your clients and say look I'm not going to do it.
[00:27:52] I'm going to guide you through every step I not only do I know what's going to go wrong or what could go wrong we're going to protect you from that we're going to make sure you're covered I've seen this a million times in my previous career and I also know all the charges that are coming along with it and I know what you're going to be looking at so you're not going to be surprised by anything at the last moment and I think that is a pretty impressive pitch to somebody because you have this intricate knowledge but again anybody could really learn this if they start reaching out to other
[00:28:22] title companies. Yeah, yes exactly. Yeah it has been it's been really nice to have that knowledge to advertise with and it comes up all the time to like in showing someone will be like oh well the seller died what we what we need to do for that do we need to wait on the street like what what do we do if we want to put in an offer you know the process you know they need to do a termination it to see it in interest it depends on who's on title.
[00:28:53] So when people call you and they want to list a property and they say hey that you know my wife just died I can't afford the house on my own it's super unfortunate situation and this is just an sample.
[00:29:04] You know the best way to go about that like hey get a hold of your title company you need to do a termination it to see it in interest so that we don't have to deal with this you know when we get to closing but you might want to wait until then because it'll save you $185 if you do it all in one so it there's all sorts of things that you can do.
[00:29:22] So there's all sorts of different knowledge that you don't.
[00:29:25] I love that and you also know a lot about capital gains which is also something that always confuses me is like wait I sell this home and then what happens to how much time do I have to sort of try to mitigate that or you know it because it changes from time to time but you you know that information and that's probably super helpful too because you can let your clients know when they're selling their property you know here's sort of the situation and now of course you're not a tax expert you know and you know it's not going to be a good example.
[00:29:52] And you don't pretend to be but you're able to share knowledge that most accountants would know with your client and therefore add more value correct.
[00:30:01] Yes yeah exactly so for example if you have a house if you've accepted offer for a $600,000 primary residents had to adults living in it that's married in the state of Wisconsin you have to pick up all gains on anything that's over 500,000.
[00:30:18] So let's say you know they're including a tractor in this that no monetary value they're including a camper and all the furnishings you're going to want to recirculate that and do the sale prices 500,000 and do an allocation for personal property for a hundred to avoid having to pick capital gains on that.
[00:30:35] So and also on the property for two years so you just yeah it's second nature after you work in time.
[00:30:43] What percentage of I know there's not a ton of agents in your area but do you think most agents even know that in your area.
[00:30:50] I would think not know I've had a lot of I've had a lot of calls when I worked in title on real terms that were asking this kind of information like hey what's the best way to do this.
[00:31:00] Even as an agent I get other real terms in my office that'll call and ask these kinds of questions as well.
[00:31:06] I love that that makes you think about how valuable that makes Cassidy in her area not only can she help somebody you know find a property and put an offer in her sell a property she knows the things that go wrong what the whole process looks like from start to finish not only monetarily but also the behavior of different lenders and and REALTORS and title title companies she knows sort of how to get the deal close fast what can possibly screw up a deal.
[00:31:33] And then what's going to happen after the deal for example if they're selling she's able to save people you know money on you know hey here's a way to get around not get around that's not the right word here's a way to to leverage this law that we have that says you know hey anything above 500,000 you pay cap gains on here's a way to still get that property sold and get that additional income and saving you taxes I mean this is this incredible like that in and of itself if you just had that transaction as you mentioned that.
[00:32:03] More than pays for your commission if you think about it because you know we're talking about maybe thirty thousand dollar savings maybe more like this is incredible amount you're like almost becoming a hero to these people in unless you know unless there are countenance and financial advisers know the stuff and tell them to do that but usually when you're working on a home purchaser sale you're probably not really working with your financial advisor you know you'll you know that's really more for investment so you know the REALTOR is is really such a great place and so I almost think you know that's really great.
[00:32:33] So that's a great conversation to have with any seller let's talk capital gains before we list your property what's going to happen the day we sell this and what's you know what's coming down the pipe for you and are there any creative strategies to avoid capital gains or minimize that that potential you know there's you can roll things into other properties there's lots of ideas and you know all of those ideas so you've seen the 1035s and 1031s you've seen those exchanges and you know what those and I assume those you can do those in Wisconsin but
[00:33:03] yeah regardless people you can learn this stuff so if I was an agent today I would be reaching out to accountants who deal with real estate attorneys as well title companies and I would say what are the things that you wish REALTOR's would know but they don't know and lenders too like as somebody who who seen all the letters you know that docs people need to get deals closed like this is incredibly helpful you really are kind of a one stop shop from start to finish and people don't have to
[00:33:32] your clients don't have to look outside of you and that makes you incredibly valuable so I guess my point is is that what Cassidy's the reason why she's had some I mean she's a lovely person and I'm sure she's an amazing REALTOR on top of all the things we talked about but even if she wasn't good at any of that she knows every step of the process and what can go wrong and how to either avoid it all together or how to get around a problem or how to solve a problem so even if her knowledge of the
[00:34:02] market in the area was it strong she still knows the entire process start to finish and she gets deals closed and she got almost 30 deals closed in her first year so couple that with being like a really nice person and really also like a good good good your job as a REALTOR like that in of itself is a super star right there and she's she basically is doing that in her first year so if I was an agent in that area I wouldn't be very happy with you I agree I think there would be people who would say I mean I'm sure they're happy for you because you know
[00:34:32] you know, you're a nice person.
[00:34:34] But at the same time, they're like,
[00:34:35] oh my gosh, she knows everything.
[00:34:37] You're right?
[00:34:37] And so now from now.
[00:34:39] So that's sort of the point is,
[00:34:41] it always increase your knowledge, everyone.
[00:34:43] Increase your knowledge of what happens
[00:34:45] at certain points of a deal.
[00:34:46] And don't be the kind of agent that just learns those answers
[00:34:50] so that you can bring that to your client
[00:34:52] because something always goes wrong in a transaction.
[00:34:55] At some point, there's always something that blips
[00:34:57] and the client freaks out.
[00:34:59] Would you say that's fair to say?
[00:35:00] Oh yeah, yup, I would say it's rare to find one.
[00:35:04] And usually it's the high dollar properties
[00:35:06] where it's smooth sailing.
[00:35:09] You don't get any issues.
[00:35:10] And then it's like your $90,000 properties
[00:35:13] where every issue arises.
[00:35:15] Right.
[00:35:16] And since you know those issues,
[00:35:18] your clients aren't blindsided by them.
[00:35:20] You're probably prepping them for disasters ahead of time,
[00:35:23] saying just in case this happens, don't worry, I've got it.
[00:35:26] You know, and then it happens.
[00:35:27] And then they're like, no, this is no big deal.
[00:35:29] We know how to fix this.
[00:35:31] So I guess this is a skill building episode to learn.
[00:35:35] But as an agent, you might think, well, how do I do that?
[00:35:37] Like we said, buddy up with the lenders,
[00:35:41] the obviously the title agents,
[00:35:43] and also the attorneys and accountants
[00:35:46] and financial estate planning attorneys,
[00:35:49] that would be another great way to go.
[00:35:51] Like talk to a estate planning attorney
[00:35:52] and go, hey, would people buy and sell real estate?
[00:35:54] Like what would a real turn need to know
[00:35:57] so that we can give our clients?
[00:35:58] You know, we don't give them tax advice,
[00:36:00] but we can push them and gently nudge them
[00:36:02] in the right direction.
[00:36:04] So I love all of that.
[00:36:06] Cassidy, you are an incredible first, you know,
[00:36:09] up and coming agent first,
[00:36:11] well, just beyond, not even your first full year.
[00:36:14] So you're gonna, you're looking to do 45 sales
[00:36:16] in a small community of 14,000 people,
[00:36:20] and only about 25 to 30 real tears in your area.
[00:36:23] You are literally the definition of taking market share away
[00:36:26] from other agents.
[00:36:27] And I don't mean that in a negative
[00:36:29] because that is an amazing, amazing accomplishment.
[00:36:32] You are building this incredible business,
[00:36:33] and you're doing it through the service you provide.
[00:36:36] And I love that.
[00:36:37] So we are so excited to continue to watch you ascend
[00:36:42] in your area.
[00:36:43] You are, I'm sure going to be the top agent very shortly
[00:36:46] if you're not already.
[00:36:48] So we want everybody to follow Cassidy.
[00:36:52] We're gonna have a link to her Facebook.
[00:36:53] She's very, she keeps it really simple.
[00:36:55] She's like, I just post everything on Facebook.
[00:36:58] So watch how she interacts with people on Facebook.
[00:37:00] Take a look, we'll give you a link to her.
[00:37:03] And by the way, if you have clients that get second homes
[00:37:07] or lake houses up in the central or northern
[00:37:10] and was actually anywhere in Wisconsin,
[00:37:12] if Cassidy can't help you,
[00:37:13] she'll know who to reach out to that could help you.
[00:37:16] But what's the best way one of our listeners
[00:37:19] could reach out to you if they have an idea,
[00:37:21] they want to run by you or maybe a referral?
[00:37:23] Yeah, either Facebook message or text call, whatever.
[00:37:29] email anyway, I am usually available
[00:37:32] or get back to you within a few minutes.
[00:37:34] We have a link to Cassidy's email
[00:37:38] and an easy way to reach her also through Facebook
[00:37:42] on in the show notes.
[00:37:43] So everyone can find her there.
[00:37:45] On behalf of our audience, Cassidy, thank you so much.
[00:37:48] By the way, Cassidy reached out to us and said,
[00:37:50] hey, I've got kind of an unusual story.
[00:37:52] I want to share it with your audience.
[00:37:53] Here we are.
[00:37:54] So it also, I love the fact that you're so proactive.
[00:37:57] You're obviously a proactive person
[00:37:58] and proactive people sometimes get spots on the show.
[00:38:02] We turned down about 90% of requests,
[00:38:04] but this was one that we thought was really special.
[00:38:06] So we appreciate your time on behalf of the audience,
[00:38:09] on behalf of Cassidy and myself.
[00:38:11] Thank you to the audience for sticking around to the very end.
[00:38:13] Please support our sponsors.
[00:38:14] They help pay the bills.
[00:38:16] Also, leave us a review.
[00:38:18] Let us know what you think of the show on iTunes
[00:38:19] or Spotify or wherever you're listening.
[00:38:22] Give us a review.
[00:38:22] Let us know.
[00:38:23] And please, lastly, tell a friend,
[00:38:26] think of one other REALTOR that needs to hear this,
[00:38:28] that goes, oh, the market's terrible right now.
[00:38:31] Well, it's not terrible for Cassidy.
[00:38:33] She's doing great.
[00:38:34] And she, yes, she has probably knowledge and information
[00:38:37] a lot of agents don't have.
[00:38:39] But if you can learn a little bit from her
[00:38:41] through this episode and take action,
[00:38:43] you could be just like her.
[00:38:44] And imagine what Cassidy, what you could do in a market
[00:38:47] with millions of people like Chicago,
[00:38:50] it would be, you'd be on fire,
[00:38:54] but you're already on fire in a small community
[00:38:56] and you're crushing it.
[00:38:58] So keep up the great work.
[00:39:00] And on behalf of everyone, thank you, Cassidy.
[00:39:03] Thank you.
[00:39:04] And we will see everybody on the next episode.

Today in our rising star series is Cassidy Eklund from RE/MAX, New Horizons, Realty in Central and Northern Wisconsin. I want to tell you why we decided to have Cassidy on the show as our rising star. Cassidy Eklund is a real estate agent at RE/MAX, New Horizons, Realty in Price County, Wisconsin. Now prior to becoming a real estate agent, which by the way, she became one in October of 2023. She was a regional member at a local title company. Now it's been her dream to apply her prior knowledge to her real estate career. And she is married to her amazing husband and has two small children. In her free time, she enjoys both fishing, spending time with family and helping her community. I want everybody to follow Cassidy on her Facebook page. I will we'll have a link to that. You can friend her on Facebook and see all the cool stuff she's into Cassidy. Welcome to the show. Yeah, thank you. I'm happy to be here. I was very excited to learn that Ryan Landers is part of the area that you service because not only did I go to camp there, but my sister went to camp in a place nearby in Managua. So funny enough, I know a little bit about your area, but only I think I was only there when I was in fourth, fifth and sixth grade. So it's been it's been some time that I've been to Ryan Lander, but it is a beautiful part of Wisconsin. Just gorgeous. I remember just amazing amazing stuff. So all right. I you're doing some amazing things early on in a I would say a difficult not only a difficult time to be a real estate agent, but also not a tremendous amount of opportunity in your area just based on population. It's not a, you know, there's nothing wrong with your areas. Awesome. It's just not super highly populated. So you are doing some insane things and I want to tell our audience about that. But before we get to how you're kicking butt out there in your first year, which is amazing. I want to hear your story. So you came from the title world. So tell us about why that how that prompted you to get into real estate. So working in title, you know, you cut your checks to everybody and I was like, oh man, every closing is kind of a slap into things. You're like, they get so they get this much. Yeah, yeah, and I absolutely loved working in title. Honestly, like if this never works out, that's exactly where I'm going back to. Yeah, it was I was the CNA for a lot of years before I got into title. So it was just kind of like an ad on a feed that I went for and ended up working there. And then I just fell in love with real estate and you're working in title. You build relationships with all the real tours in your area, all the lenders, local, non local, like pretty much anybody within a tool radius. I probably talked to them or done business with them at one point. So it's just it was really nice getting to know people and then learning like what they do. And then I just kind of branched off from there and decided to become a real estate agent. So let me let me understand. And by the way, full disclosure, I'm a part owner in a title company and I don't even understand title. So that's kind of embarrassing to admit, but we're not here to talk about title anyway. But what what what I do want to know about your experience at title is you got to see how agents acted. You got to see their behavior. You got to see who in your local community was able to get deals closed. You were also able to see what they charged. You're also able to see what the what the lenders, how the lenders performed in their behavior. So you got this really in depth knowledge of like who's doing it a certain way, who's doing it a different way, who's most effective. And let's talk about that like that's incredible knowledge for to have. Yeah, yeah, it's coming handy, especially when you're buyers who aren't pre approved yet and they want contacts, you know, you know, which lenders you send an email to and they don't go back to you for four days or which ones work nights, the million, at six o'clock at night. Yeah, it's been amazing and not only that, but you also see like what lenders charge for loan fees. So every lender they charge a different amount and closing fees. So that that's been incredible. And you know, you have your ones who they keep pushing out closing, pushing out closing, wanting more from the buyers. So you get to pin down who those are and you get some really good contacts and get close to your local lenders. So yeah, it was really just amazing building those relationships before I got into this and carrying it all over. So for our listeners, here is not a terrible idea to consider find out, you know, you if you're listening to this, you have closed deals, which means you've probably worked with a title company. If you're in a state that does that and well, there's always title, but you know, depending on if you go through attorneys or not every state's a little bit different there. But if you are able to talk to reps at title companies, they know all this stuff. They know the lenders who get deals closed to charge the least. They know the lenders that charge more and maybe don't work as hard or certainly more difficult to work with. This is a great place to learn from them so that you as the agent, you know, you are more confident, reaching saying to your clients, especially your buyers. Hey, I, I'm friends with some of the title reps in our area. I know who's really actually good. Everybody says they're good, but I know who's actually good. And I'm going to get you that. And I imagine, Cassidy, like, that's an amazing thing to bring to a buyer that separates you from a lot of other agents right there. You have this sort of like behind the scenes knowledge that you can bring to your buyers and say, you know what, here's the best lender. Like you have confidence that you know, basically the best lenders in your area. Yeah, yeah, exactly. And honestly, all throughout Wisconsin, because in my area, it's a lot of people buying Blake houses or, you know, second properties hunting land, that kind of stuff. So I would have people who would use their local lenders all around Wisconsin, Illinois, Michigan, Minnesota all over the place. So not only just within a tour radius, but all over the place. So I love it. And this is the first time we've ever had a REALTOR on who was previously a title, you know, title rep. And so this is really, really cool stuff. I love the fact that you had this knowledge and you go, wait a minute, I can apply this knowledge to become a REALTOR because now I know things that most REALTORS don't know. Yeah. But I want to also talk about making the switch because, you know, people see you in one career and it's related to real estate, but it's not necessarily they see you as a REALTOR, they see you as somebody to help them, you know, get the title closed or part of the transaction. So when you made that switch, how did you start, what was your plan to make sure that people now saw you as a REALTOR as opposed to a title first. And by the way, we should mention, I'm sorry, let me mention for a while. Cassidy was doing both basically both full time. So she was still working at the title company. In fact, was April of was it last year when you decided to go full time. Yeah, yeah, per so she hasn't even been doing this full time a year. So we're going to talk about her numbers in a minute, which is insane. But sorry, back to my question. So people see you as a title person, you're still working at the title company. Was that difficult to get people to now look at you as as a real estate agent. It was, yeah, I think in the beginning, you know, when I was working both jobs, they mostly saw me as, you know, Cassidy in title and I wasn't really fully applying myself to real estate. Some of my local REALTORS, they weren't too happy that I would imagine they're not. So I am glad that I branched out and decided to do this full time. But yeah, I mean, now everything is perfectly fine. I have really good relationships with everybody else still because, you know, I worked, I was there for three years, built these relationships with all these different REALTORS. And now that has made communication with everybody so much better because I had all the relationships beforehand, not like, hey, I have this transaction with John Smith, have you done a deal with them? Do you know what he's like? Like that kind of thing, you know, who everybody is. Well, that's also super helpful too, because you know which REALTORS play nice with others. You've seen it firsthand. You know, which REALTORS can be more challenging. And so when you're getting, if you're working with, you know, a buyer or a seller and you see the agent on the other side of the deal, you can then say to your client, I know so and so. And I mean, you're in a smaller community where there aren't thousands of thousands of REALTORS, so you probably would know everyone anyway, but you really know how they work. And so you have the ability to say this person is going to get our help get our deal closed or this person can be, you know, maybe wouldn't say challenging, but you know they're challenging. And then you can take additional steps to determine, you know what you want to do. So this knowledge is really, really important. I love that. So we should talk about your numbers because, you know, the fact that you came from the title industry is really cool and certainly gave you this awareness of the industry, but it doesn't necessarily translate to sales. Like it doesn't mean just because you know that you were able to actually close deals, but you have closed deals. So let's talk about last year, 2024, which we'll just call it your first actual year in the business, but again, not going full time until basically may. So are April or May. So what did you do in your first year? First year, I had about 30 transactions closer so and got close to 4 million in sales. So. That's pretty amazing. 30 say roughly 30 sales and 4 million and we should also mention that what's just to give us an example, what is the average price point in your area? Average price point is probably about 250, 250,000 or so. Yep, I love it. So you have to close quite a few sales to get to that number, which you did. Now for anybody to close 30 sales in any given year is pretty impressive. You did it in year one. And yes, you had this background knowledge of, you know, what lenders work well, which other agents, you know, how they work. How did you actually find these clients? So a lot of them were generated leads that are provided through my office, which was really nice. And then it was really just like word amount, you know, you deal with a lot of people who regularly use the title company for like first sale by owners and that kind of stuff. So you kind of drop your name like, hey, I'm getting real estate. I know you're not working with REALTOR if you ever need anybody, just let me know. So that that helped me out quite a bit. I got a few clients that way and then also I kind of do I try to think of different ways to advertise in unique ways. So I did like a photo shoot with my children where I was showing them a little plastic playhouse and had a professional photographer take the pictures and have them sit at a table and sign a paper that said, deed at the top. And did like a little photo shoot with them and I've got a lot of feedback on that, which was it was really fun. And yeah, that was that was great. So I posted that on Facebook. Otherwise, if most of it's been advertising on Facebook posting my listings on Facebook, you get, you know, 20 people that say that message you on one listing. If that's not the property for them, I say, OK, if this one's not the one, let's find you the right one. And then I end up getting a lot of buyers that way. Wow, that's that's amazing. So just by posting a just listed or just sold or whatever, you get people that interact with you in Facebook. And then you're able to say, Hey, I have access to everything, not just this one home. Let's talk. Let's find out what you're looking for because this may or may not be the right place, but I've got access to everything. So I got some other ideas for you. Yeah, yeah, thanks Ashley. I love that. And so, you know, let's let's dive a little bit into into sort of, you know, yes, you got some leads from from your company, which is great. But you also did most of it on your own, which is, which is really incredible. You know, I want to talk a little bit about sort of the size of your market. So how many total REALTORS are there in your area? Just guess, you know, it asked them. I would say in the county, maybe 25 30 right. So that's she didn't say now here in Chicago, we have, including the suburbs, 46,000 REALTORS to give people a sort of a, you know, an idea of how it's different in a big metropolitan city like Chicago. So she's in a really small area. Everybody knows everybody, of course. And she's able to pull 30 transactions in her first year with inner, you know, being being a, well, not even a full time REALTOR. So this is a pretty incredible thing. So what you're doing is amazing. I want to ask you, what are you doing to keep the momentum going? So how are you building your business now? I am working on doing different types of mailings, different types of advertising, like dropping stuff off at local businesses for people to pick up as they're stopping in with my business card attached to it. No funny sign. I try to throw you where I'm almost everything that I do because people get a kick out of that. Yeah, otherwise it's just keeping base with all of my past clients. I treat everybody like they're my grandma pretty much. I that yeah, I try to keep in touch go to dinner with people just so you're kind of always in the back their head. So once somebody closes, you'll still continue to hang out with them, call them from time to time, maybe might him to dinner. Yes, you have exactly. Gotcha, that's that's really cool. Now I want to ask about dropping off things at your local businesses because that's something I don't hear a lot of agents talk about. So yes, they're local merchants, businesses that you you like in your area. What kind of things are you leaving there for people to take and you know how do you approach the you know the owner of the of the you know the retail shop or whatever it is and say, hey, I'd like to do put my stuff here. Yeah, so one of them that I've done is dropping off like a pile of business cards at a drink store nutritional drink store. And I'm a regular customer there. So I knew we're in a personal level. You know everybody when population is only 14,000 in the whole entire county. So, um, yeah, otherwise I'm working on one right now where I'm putting together little bags filled with one has like dog treats and I have like 500 big spade up. And then I have one where I'm doing little cat mice toys in separate bags of the business card attached to them all and I'm going to drop them off at like human societies and that clinics and also donate like separate stuff for the animals that are already there. So you know donating and saying, hey, do you mind if I put this up there. It usually they're not going to tell you know. Yeah, I love that. I mean, you're a hustler. I love that you're thinking about where do my clients go or where do my future clients go. Where are they hang out? Where are they getting pets and you know you can even go to pet food stores possibly a do the same thing right. And so you have this you have this thought of where do my clients hang out and how can I not I'm not going to be I can't hang out there with them at all times. But how can I be there when I'm not there basically and so you're doing things like you know little treats and I love that that is that is really that is I don't know anyone I've done this show for seven years. I don't know anyone that's actually shared with me that exact strategy. So thank you for sharing that our audience. So basically our audience think about a merchant that you have a relationship with in your local area and think about what you could do to help them. Maybe you put a fish bowl in there and you're like, Hey, I give away a free lunch once a week or once a month or whatever. Drop your business card and you know something simple like that. It could be even that or if you want to go a step further think of an item of value that you could give to the to the customer. And or something you can do for the merchant maybe you're like, Hey, I'm going to promote your business. I'm going to put you on Facebook all the time or I'm going to you know I'll give him a coupon or something there's all sorts of cool things you can do and partner with local businesses that I think a lot of agents just don't think about doing. Yeah, yeah, exactly and I'm trying to think out of the box and try to find things that most agents don't typically do. Yeah, so let's talk about your sort of your transition again. So you transition from title agent to real estate agent and now you're doing deals you know left and right you're getting business. And so what are your goals for this year like what would you like to do in production how many deals do you think you can do that kind of thing. I would like to times my sales from last year by about 1.5 so I'm looking to get about 45 sales and then get like 6000 very 6 million I mean sorry about that. That's pretty amazing and at some point you're going to be in team building mode because you are going to hit you're going to hit a limit and you're going to hit it soon. And so at some point we really think about what Cassie's doing she's building this amazing pipeline to get her to this high number of transactions and then she's going to say I need a partner or maybe not maybe you can do it all yourself. I love that though you are you are really crushing it. What advice if you were a brand new REALTOR starting out in a you know not obviously not your market but a different market and what what do you what would you tell a new agent to do or any agent that's struggling right now that doesn't have any business. I would tell them to go out to your local businesses and make friends with whoever you can once you make that relationship you can not pursue use that but you can you can kind of combine and go on marketing together for instance like hey if you give me a pile of your business cards I'll put them in my office give them out to clients could be a contractor's office something like that and then in return you can say hey if I could just you know leave a pile here something like that. Or you got to try to think of places that would be willing to send referrals your way like for example a title company make friends with your title agents because I can't tell you how many times they get the phone calls hey I'm looking to buy property there I don't know who to call for a REALTOR who would you recommend I got that call so many times when I worked in title and I actually do that to this day as a REALTOR if I tried to do my referrals out to RE/MAX agents because I'm a RE/MAX agent. But if there's no RE/MAX agents in that area the title company is the first people that I call so make friends with your title company. Now one of the really the one of the benefits of working I want to switch gears to talk about what can go wrong in a transaction because as somebody who worked in the title industry you've seen every sort of disaster happen in a transaction so let's talk about how that knowledge really helps you get deals close faster because from what I understand you're constantly thinking about what you're doing. So I'm thinking about what could go wrong right now and so talk about that process. Yeah, yeah, so it's exactly what you said like I whenever I'm drafting documents writing an offer if there's anything that's out of the ordinary the first thing I say to myself is how can this go wrong. For example if a seller's leaving personal property on property until after closing let's say it's a it's a camper in the yard. And they want to leave it here because we have three feet of snow or something and they live out of state they're not coming up until summer. I make sure like I say what can go wrong here and then I go to thinking about when the ground thoughts and everything is a wet mushy mess. You pull on a camper through a yard that's going to create ruts so you need to put in there that any damage to the lawn or driveway needs to be repaired by X state have a deadline for when those people need to come and get their stuff. If there's any damage buyers aren't responsible for that seller needs to get that fixed so just it really makes you think what what can happen here and also easements there's a lot of general easements out there that don't show up. So in the state what happens if this culvert goes out because it's on the easement and it's on this other property to on the subject property. So when there's something that's on both of their properties or there's not a written driveway agreement in place where it states who is responsible for repairs that stuff needs to be specified before closing just in case something would happen. So you just kind of always tell yourself what can go wrong. And I guess a title company is a great place to learn that you know I know you had mentioned if you were starting out in real estate you might start out in title again if you were to do it all over again you might do it the exact same way because the knowledge you gained was great now for everyone listening who's already a REALTOR you're probably not going to stop doing that to work in title. But I think the idea of budding up with a title person and becoming their best friend and you know doing something nice for them and then saying hey I want to learn from you I want to learn what can go wrong and a transaction as an agent what do you wish agents knew before they got to the closing table you know this is stuff that Cassidy already knows but this is knowledge that anybody can really learn if you develop good relationships. Yeah yeah exactly and another thing to you know working in title you're sitting there you're going through loan docs you're talking with the customers a lot of times like REALTOR is they'll come in and they'll look at the closing statement at the closing table and they'll say oh like we're we're missing something. It's nice to have that knowledge ahead of time because if it's a massive on title I'm more likely to catch that when I review it ahead of time rather than be not working in title and not even knowing what to look for. So I know what fees they charge I know what should be on that closing statement I know what fees the lenders want on that closing statement so it just makes you overlook everything a second time and make sure that everything is good. Now I've bought several properties in my life and I'm in this business and I still whenever I close I'm always like do I need to do I need to bring money to like I never know what what I'm going like it's always it's always a mystery right like the day before my attorney or something will be like okay you need to bring a check or you don't need to bring a check and I never know what it is I just trust everyone's working in my best interest but the reality of it is somebody does need to know that and what you have you know almost to the penny. What somebody's going to what a closing is going to look like and I will tell you as somebody that is in this business but also not really an agent I mean I'm technically one but I don't practice so I'm think of me as just like an average person on the street who doesn't really know the business I know what's going on with closings and by the way again I partner in a title company I truthfully know a whole lot about it and it's embarrassing but but it's true so I need this information and I have a hard time getting it you were able to go to your clients and say look I'm not going to do it. I'm going to guide you through every step I not only do I know what's going to go wrong or what could go wrong we're going to protect you from that we're going to make sure you're covered I've seen this a million times in my previous career and I also know all the charges that are coming along with it and I know what you're going to be looking at so you're not going to be surprised by anything at the last moment and I think that is a pretty impressive pitch to somebody because you have this intricate knowledge but again anybody could really learn this if they start reaching out to other title companies. Yeah, yes exactly. Yeah it has been it's been really nice to have that knowledge to advertise with and it comes up all the time to like in showing someone will be like oh well the seller died what we what we need to do for that do we need to wait on the street like what what do we do if we want to put in an offer you know the process you know they need to do a termination it to see it in interest it depends on who's on title. So when people call you and they want to list a property and they say hey that you know my wife just died I can't afford the house on my own it's super unfortunate situation and this is just an sample. You know the best way to go about that like hey get a hold of your title company you need to do a termination it to see it in interest so that we don't have to deal with this you know when we get to closing but you might want to wait until then because it'll save you $185 if you do it all in one so it there's all sorts of things that you can do. So there's all sorts of different knowledge that you don't. I love that and you also know a lot about capital gains which is also something that always confuses me is like wait I sell this home and then what happens to how much time do I have to sort of try to mitigate that or you know it because it changes from time to time but you you know that information and that's probably super helpful too because you can let your clients know when they're selling their property you know here's sort of the situation and now of course you're not a tax expert you know and you know it's not going to be a good example. And you don't pretend to be but you're able to share knowledge that most accountants would know with your client and therefore add more value correct. Yes yeah exactly so for example if you have a house if you've accepted offer for a $600,000 primary residents had to adults living in it that's married in the state of Wisconsin you have to pick up all gains on anything that's over 500,000. So let's say you know they're including a tractor in this that no monetary value they're including a camper and all the furnishings you're going to want to recirculate that and do the sale prices 500,000 and do an allocation for personal property for a hundred to avoid having to pick capital gains on that. So and also on the property for two years so you just yeah it's second nature after you work in time. What percentage of I know there's not a ton of agents in your area but do you think most agents even know that in your area. I would think not know I've had a lot of I've had a lot of calls when I worked in title on real terms that were asking this kind of information like hey what's the best way to do this. Even as an agent I get other real terms in my office that'll call and ask these kinds of questions as well. I love that that makes you think about how valuable that makes Cassidy in her area not only can she help somebody you know find a property and put an offer in her sell a property she knows the things that go wrong what the whole process looks like from start to finish not only monetarily but also the behavior of different lenders and and REALTORS and title title companies she knows sort of how to get the deal close fast what can possibly screw up a deal. And then what's going to happen after the deal for example if they're selling she's able to save people you know money on you know hey here's a way to get around not get around that's not the right word here's a way to to leverage this law that we have that says you know hey anything above 500,000 you pay cap gains on here's a way to still get that property sold and get that additional income and saving you taxes I mean this is this incredible like that in and of itself if you just had that transaction as you mentioned that. More than pays for your commission if you think about it because you know we're talking about maybe thirty thousand dollar savings maybe more like this is incredible amount you're like almost becoming a hero to these people in unless you know unless there are countenance and financial advisers know the stuff and tell them to do that but usually when you're working on a home purchaser sale you're probably not really working with your financial advisor you know you'll you know that's really more for investment so you know the REALTOR is is really such a great place and so I almost think you know that's really great. So that's a great conversation to have with any seller let's talk capital gains before we list your property what's going to happen the day we sell this and what's you know what's coming down the pipe for you and are there any creative strategies to avoid capital gains or minimize that that potential you know there's you can roll things into other properties there's lots of ideas and you know all of those ideas so you've seen the 1035s and 1031s you've seen those exchanges and you know what those and I assume those you can do those in Wisconsin but yeah regardless people you can learn this stuff so if I was an agent today I would be reaching out to accountants who deal with real estate attorneys as well title companies and I would say what are the things that you wish REALTOR's would know but they don't know and lenders too like as somebody who who seen all the letters you know that docs people need to get deals closed like this is incredibly helpful you really are kind of a one stop shop from start to finish and people don't have to your clients don't have to look outside of you and that makes you incredibly valuable so I guess my point is is that what Cassidy's the reason why she's had some I mean she's a lovely person and I'm sure she's an amazing REALTOR on top of all the things we talked about but even if she wasn't good at any of that she knows every step of the process and what can go wrong and how to either avoid it all together or how to get around a problem or how to solve a problem so even if her knowledge of the market in the area was it strong she still knows the entire process start to finish and she gets deals closed and she got almost 30 deals closed in her first year so couple that with being like a really nice person and really also like a good good good your job as a REALTOR like that in of itself is a super star right there and she's she basically is doing that in her first year so if I was an agent in that area I wouldn't be very happy with you I agree I think there would be people who would say I mean I'm sure they're happy for you because you know you know, you're a nice person. But at the same time, they're like, oh my gosh, she knows everything. You're right? And so now from now. So that's sort of the point is, it always increase your knowledge, everyone. Increase your knowledge of what happens at certain points of a deal. And don't be the kind of agent that just learns those answers so that you can bring that to your client because something always goes wrong in a transaction. At some point, there's always something that blips and the client freaks out. Would you say that's fair to say? Oh yeah, yup, I would say it's rare to find one. And usually it's the high dollar properties where it's smooth sailing. You don't get any issues. And then it's like your $90,000 properties where every issue arises. Right. And since you know those issues, your clients aren't blindsided by them. You're probably prepping them for disasters ahead of time, saying just in case this happens, don't worry, I've got it. You know, and then it happens. And then they're like, no, this is no big deal. We know how to fix this. So I guess this is a skill building episode to learn. But as an agent, you might think, well, how do I do that? Like we said, buddy up with the lenders, the obviously the title agents, and also the attorneys and accountants and financial estate planning attorneys, that would be another great way to go. Like talk to a estate planning attorney and go, hey, would people buy and sell real estate? Like what would a real turn need to know so that we can give our clients? You know, we don't give them tax advice, but we can push them and gently nudge them in the right direction. So I love all of that. Cassidy, you are an incredible first, you know, up and coming agent first, well, just beyond, not even your first full year. So you're gonna, you're looking to do 45 sales in a small community of 14,000 people, and only about 25 to 30 real tears in your area. You are literally the definition of taking market share away from other agents. And I don't mean that in a negative because that is an amazing, amazing accomplishment. You are building this incredible business, and you're doing it through the service you provide. And I love that. So we are so excited to continue to watch you ascend in your area. You are, I'm sure going to be the top agent very shortly if you're not already. So we want everybody to follow Cassidy. We're gonna have a link to her Facebook. She's very, she keeps it really simple. She's like, I just post everything on Facebook. So watch how she interacts with people on Facebook. Take a look, we'll give you a link to her. And by the way, if you have clients that get second homes or lake houses up in the central or northern and was actually anywhere in Wisconsin, if Cassidy can't help you, she'll know who to reach out to that could help you. But what's the best way one of our listeners could reach out to you if they have an idea, they want to run by you or maybe a referral? Yeah, either Facebook message or text call, whatever. email anyway, I am usually available or get back to you within a few minutes. We have a link to Cassidy's email and an easy way to reach her also through Facebook on in the show notes. So everyone can find her there. On behalf of our audience, Cassidy, thank you so much. By the way, Cassidy reached out to us and said, hey, I've got kind of an unusual story. I want to share it with your audience. Here we are. So it also, I love the fact that you're so proactive. You're obviously a proactive person and proactive people sometimes get spots on the show. We turned down about 90% of requests, but this was one that we thought was really special. So we appreciate your time on behalf of the audience, on behalf of Cassidy and myself. Thank you to the audience for sticking around to the very end. Please support our sponsors. They help pay the bills. Also, leave us a review. Let us know what you think of the show on iTunes or Spotify or wherever you're listening. Give us a review. Let us know. And please, lastly, tell a friend, think of one other REALTOR that needs to hear this, that goes, oh, the market's terrible right now. Well, it's not terrible for Cassidy. She's doing great. And she, yes, she has probably knowledge and information a lot of agents don't have. But if you can learn a little bit from her through this episode and take action, you could be just like her. And imagine what Cassidy, what you could do in a market with millions of people like Chicago, it would be, you'd be on fire, but you're already on fire in a small community and you're crushing it. So keep up the great work. And on behalf of everyone, thank you, Cassidy. Thank you. And we will see everybody on the next episode.
