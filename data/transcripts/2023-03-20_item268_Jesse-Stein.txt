[00:02:35] Hey, today on the show, we have Jesse Stein from audience.co. Let me tell you more about Jesse.
[00:02:44] Now Jesse has an impressive background as a serial entrepreneur. He's founded, grown, and sold multiple

[00:03:25] Wharton School, an MA in International Studies from University of Pennsylvania's Lauderd Institute,
[00:03:31] and a BA with honors in Sociology and Asian Studies from UC Santa Barbara and Sofia University
[00:03:37] in Tokyo. Please, oh, to learn all things Jesse, check out his newest venture,
[00:03:44] audiance.co. That's audiance.co. And we're going to be speaking about that today. Jesse, welcome to
[00:03:49] the show. Thanks, TJ, for having me. It's an amazing pedigree. Your background, your Vite, as they
[00:03:58] stay. I love reading back. And I would really, you know, this is a more unusual episode for us.
[00:04:06] So traditionally, we're normally we're speaking just to real estate agents about how they became
[00:04:11] successful. And very rarely do we talk to sort of experts out tangentially related to real estate,
[00:04:17] but not specifically out there producing. But I'm really excited to chat with you because you've
[00:04:21] been a digital marketer for, oh gosh, 20 plus years. And I am excited to learn some of your sort of
[00:04:30] success secrets and what you might suggest our audience start paying attention to in 2023.
[00:04:39] Likewise, really excited to add value to you guys. You can get your money back, but you can't get
[00:04:44] your time back. So I really appreciate all the listeners here. And I just want to add, I just
[00:04:49] want to add value. Great. Yeah. Well, let's start. I would love to hear about the start of your
[00:04:55] digital marketing journey. Like how did you get into the digital marketing space?
[00:05:00] I'd just graduated from Wharton in the late 90s and right place, right time, beginning of the
[00:05:06] commercial internet, New York City. I was just married, started a company called Soho Digital,
[00:05:13] which you had mentioned and grew it into a $30 million interactive agency sold it in 2005.
[00:05:22] And they're really learned how to build sales funnels by online media and do SEO. And all that
[00:05:32] became the foundation really for my digital marketing career. And after that, I got into
[00:05:39] domaining after I sold that you'd mentioned that. So I bought hobbies.com, biking.com, boating.com,
[00:05:46] yawning.com, all these like really category defining domain names. And the plan was to take
[00:05:52] these domain names and build them into full fledged businesses, the way that you would buy beachfront
[00:05:58] real estate and build a condo tower. But the one that really took off was sportsmemorbiliate.com.
[00:06:05] And bought that as completely raw domain in 2005. And with a group of people
[00:06:11] imminently smarter and more talented than me, which is a common thread that runs through my career,
[00:06:17] we built it into the biggest autograph store on the internet, top 500 internet retailer,
[00:06:22] and we sold it to fanatics in 2013. And along the way, I built with business partners,
[00:06:29] a skincare company to $50 million sold in 2009. And that was all direct to consumer via internet.
[00:06:37] And then started diet spotlight.com, which became one of the biggest nutrition and diet websites
[00:06:43] on the internet. And at sportsmem, we were sending handwritten notes to our customers. And
[00:06:54] we noticed that the customers that received the handwritten notes, now I'm kind of sagwaying into
[00:06:59] audience.co, which is the company that sends handwritten notes on behalf of REALTORS to help them
[00:07:06] drive more listings. And we combine the handwritten notes with digital marketing. So it's really
[00:07:10] cool. We use the handwritten note as a Trojan horse. But at sportsmemorbiliate.com, we were sending
[00:07:15] notes. And we noticed that the clients that received notes spent way more money with us. So if someone
[00:07:21] had bought a lecture starting, yeah, they sent way more money, spent way more money with us,
[00:07:26] but there was no scale to it. Because we were having warehouse workers and consultants and admin
[00:07:33] staff send the notes. The handwriting was often embarrassing. So there was no scale to it. We were
[00:07:39] waiting for someone to do this. And so three years ago, hired a team of software engineers,
[00:07:45] and we built these robots and the software. And they hold pins and they write precisely like
[00:07:51] humans. And we can go into that more DJ. But that's kind of the genesis of my digital marketing career.
[00:07:57] Well, that's really fasting. So I want to go back to the handwritten note, just sort of metric that
[00:08:02] you were mentioning that you noticed that so somebody would buy something. They buy a piece of sports
[00:08:09] memorbiliate. You'd write a hey, thanks for being a customer. We really appreciate it. You know,
[00:08:13] someone would write it. Maybe it would look nice. Maybe it wouldn't. But regardless, those people
[00:08:18] would then return and spend more money. That's exactly right. We noticed there was a direct
[00:08:24] correlation between and we would run these AB tests where the control group would be the customers
[00:08:29] that didn't receive notes. And then we take a look at the lifetime value of the customers that
[00:08:34] did. And it was just way beyond any kind of statistical probability. Those that receive notes
[00:08:42] spent way more money were more loyal, left better reviews were happier clients and so on and so
[00:08:49] forth. But again, there was no scale to it. And that was key. And then there was no combination
[00:08:55] with the note, original marketing, which is absolutely critical, which I can talk about
[00:09:01] a little bit later on in the show if you want. Yeah, that's fascinating. I think this idea of
[00:09:07] the return to pen and paper is, well, I don't know that we've returned to pen and paper. I don't
[00:09:14] know that we'll ever return to pen and paper as a society. But there is something maybe even more
[00:09:20] magical these days about receiving a handwritten note. I can count on one hand the number of handwritten
[00:09:27] notes I receive from anyone. You know, outside of birthday cards and things. But just in a year,
[00:09:35] maybe I get three or four, maybe that's even high. But every single time I do receive what I believe
[00:09:43] to be as a handwritten note, whether it's helped with robots with pens or if it's somebody actually
[00:09:49] using their hand, I read every single word because I don't know. I guess we're just hardwired to
[00:09:55] sort of appreciate that more. I'm not even sure exactly why that captures my attention more than
[00:10:00] an email. But we all know just intrinsically that it does. And it's also a lost art, something that,
[00:10:07] you know, obviously, you know, a lot of industries have moved very far away from. But there is something very,
[00:10:15] I would say connecting about handwritten notes. It feels intimate and it feels special and it makes
[00:10:24] the other person feel very, yeah, very grateful, I'd say. So curious to get your thoughts on why
[00:10:32] handwritten notes. Why do you think that's working so well? Yeah, just like anything, when you zoom in,
[00:10:39] the devil's in the details. So it's the way that we engineer the note. And then the key is the
[00:10:48] way that we combine it with AI and digital marketing, which I'll talk about in a second and all the
[00:10:56] components are key, just like, just like anything. So what we do with the note is we print it, I'm just
[00:11:03] holding up, obviously, the people listening, we'll be able to see this. But we print it on a
[00:11:08] fixed.card. There's, as it turns out, there's an ideal character length. So you want your notes,
[00:11:16] whether you work with us or whether you try it yourself, you want your handwritten notes, if you're
[00:11:22] a REALTOR, to be right around 650 characters. This is enough character length to be able to tell your
[00:11:30] story about, for example, how you just listed 17 Chestnut Street in Toledo, Ohio. And you can
[00:11:38] even include us a short market report there as well in the 650 characters. And then what you want to do
[00:11:46] is you want to create a graphic on the front of the note that aligns with the neighborhood. So it'd be
[00:11:55] a local landmark. And then you want to apply a filter to the graphic to make it aesthetically pleasing,
[00:12:01] like a water color or an impressionistic filter. And then you want your note card to be, we've learned
[00:12:08] all this through trial and error. You want your note card to be a bifold note. So what it does is,
[00:12:14] so the card is bifold. And of course, the envelope is handwritten as well. But never use pre-canceled
[00:12:23] stamps. So the temptation is to save a little bit of money by using the pre-canceled stamp. As it
[00:12:28] turns out, people really notice that. So use a real first-class post-stamp, cost of 62 cents. Hand
[00:12:38] that will get that will get the note from the mailbox to the kitchen counter. Okay. And then
[00:12:43] it'll optimize for open rate, which is great. So you have it open. But now they crack it open. They pull
[00:12:50] out the note. And it needs to be aesthetically pleasing. So they open the note. They see something a
[00:12:57] landmark that they recognize and that a landmark that is likely to make them feel good about their
[00:13:03] community or wherever their geographical location. So they see something they recognize in a
[00:13:08] cool way with a cool filter on it. That's on the cover. And then they're like, oh, I know what that
[00:13:13] is. And then they, and by the way, we're really talking in this particular example about a cold
[00:13:21] mail. So somebody receives a handwritten note on a heavy stock, a real stamp, not a stamp
[00:13:30] machine. They open it up. They see something they recognize. They still don't really know what it is.
[00:13:35] They open it up. And okay, I just wanted to sort of catch our audience. Absolutely.
[00:13:39] Absolutely. So and we can also talk to how do you use these notes? Again, whether you work with
[00:13:45] us or whether you try it yourself, how you use notes for both geographic farming and to nurture
[00:13:52] your sphere. So there's two different ways. For example, Tom Ferry, who's seen every single real-state
[00:13:58] tool on Earth, decided to invest in us. And he's a very happy client. So as Chris Heller, who you've
[00:14:05] interviewed, he's a Shermer, Steve of Keller Williams, you can ask all these people. You can go to our
[00:14:09] site. There's dozens and dozens of testimonials from top agents. Feel free to reach out to any of
[00:14:13] them. But they've opened the envelope. They take out the note. They read it. There should be no
[00:14:19] bait and switch element whatsoever to to the note or any of the marketing you do for that matter.
[00:14:26] And remember, in general, your marketing should be about adding value, right? About guiding more,
[00:14:36] about educating more, about helping more, about serving more, about mitigating and answering
[00:14:41] questions more than any other REALTOR in your neighborhood. So that's why our template library,
[00:14:50] which is vast, and we've sent millions of millions of notes. So we know precisely the note templates
[00:14:55] that work depending upon the touch. So you've just sold a house. We know what touch number one
[00:15:00] needs to look like. Touch number three. And in general, the common thread that runs through everything we do
[00:15:06] is it's all about adding value. It's all about educating. It's all about helping that homeowner
[00:15:11] make the right decision whether they go with you or not. So they've opened, they've taken the
[00:15:17] the note out. They've noticed the beautiful graphic. They've read it. And then what's really important
[00:15:22] is to include a QR code sticker on there. And you can't print the QR code sticker. You need to
[00:15:30] actually have a real sticker. You can't just print the QR code on there because that looks mechanical.
[00:15:35] Right. And it's sort of the whole thing sort of falls apart at that point. Yeah. You got it. Yeah,
[00:15:40] the illusion kind of falls apart. So make sure that the stamp on the front of the envelope is
[00:15:45] slightly off-kilter. Make sure that QR code sticker is slightly off-kilter. And what you want to
[00:15:52] do is you want to record a short either a YouTube video or a video that's on your brokerage website
[00:15:59] that is not personalized to the individual homeowner because that's way too much work. But
[00:16:04] personalize it to their neighborhood. Hey, greetings, Kibiskein resident. Thank you.
[00:16:09] Greetings, Kibiskein resident. Thank you so much for scanning my note. I just wanted to include a
[00:16:14] little market report. Let you know I've listed a few homes in your area. I'm at your service. I
[00:16:22] give, give, give, give, then get later. So it's all about adding value. So you add the value,
[00:16:30] you have the QR code sticker, then here's the real power of the notes and the real secret.
[00:16:35] Twofold. Number one, you can now use the note as a Trojan horse to market to that homeowner
[00:16:43] in a variety of different ways. Okay, that's why I named the company Audienst.co. I didn't name it
[00:16:49] something old school with handwriting or addresses or something else because I knew it's all about
[00:16:56] taking a cold audience and it's about warming up that audience. So now you can even go door knocking
[00:17:02] if that's your thing. You can next time you see them at a networking event and by the way run
[00:17:07] this experiment, send a hundred of our handwritten notes or do them yourself to a hundred household,
[00:17:13] go door knocking, you will be completely blown away at how receptive and warm and welcoming
[00:17:19] those homeowners are because you've generated the most important thing of all, which is reciprocity.
[00:17:26] You have sent them a beautiful aesthetically pleasing note that guess what, you've optimized for
[00:17:32] the second secret, which is they've kept and displayed it. So the decision to sell on its home
[00:17:39] is a really high consideration, high dollar amount, very, very among the biggest decisions any
[00:17:46] consumer ever makes. So what are the chances that they're actually going to be interested in
[00:17:52] what's in their home on the day you send the note? Very, very soon. Yeah, zero. Zero. So as it turns
[00:17:59] out, handwritten notes and I've been a marketer now for almost 25 years. This is the one medium
[00:18:07] that defies the time space continuum. And let me explain next, that sounds a little bit esoteric.
[00:18:13] There as long as you make it aesthetically pleasing and engineer it in the way I've talked about
[00:18:18] with a thick stock note, the bifold note, the note will end up on their kitchen counter. We'll end
[00:18:25] up on their home office desk. We'll end up even on the refrigerator and magnet, even on their
[00:18:30] mantle. And they will remember you. And they'll have a warm feeling. And they will feel the sense
[00:18:38] of reciprocity. And so when they are interested in selling their home, you are absolutely going to
[00:18:45] be top of mind. I don't care if you're new to the farm. If someone else has been farming that
[00:18:50] neighborhood for generations, the fact that you took the time to send these beautiful handwritten
[00:18:57] notes with the real first class posted stamp will resonate. Then use them as a Trojan horse. So
[00:19:03] what you want to do now, and what our platform does is we find, first of all, our lead filtering
[00:19:09] database makes it so we only send notes to the most likely to sell households. So when we have
[00:19:14] map functionality where you can freehand draw and you can literally take a scalpel out and get
[00:19:20] super surgical with your lead. So if you listed at home at 17 Chestnut Street, you can then
[00:19:27] hit surrounding households with our notes, but only the households that are most likely to sell.
[00:19:32] So we have 200 plus filters. You can filter by owner age, equity level, how long ago the COO
[00:19:37] was issued, and so on and so forth. Then what we do is we find all the email addresses of all,
[00:19:43] this is my digital marketing background comes in. We find all the email addresses of all the
[00:19:48] primary and secondary owners. We find all their LinkedIn profiles and we find all their other
[00:19:52] social handles. And then we have an app that you go to and you automatically follow up. So it's
[00:19:57] using the note as a Trojan horse a week later from our system, the homeowner gets an email with a
[00:20:03] subject line that says, did you receive my handwritten note? And this will double or triple response.
[00:20:10] So response is typically all in after all of our follow up between 3 and 5%, which is
[00:20:17] 10 to 12 times a response of normal direct. Yeah, yeah, exceptional.
[00:20:23] That's exceptional. So let's go through the I want to go through the workflow again because this is
[00:20:27] this you're kind of blowing my mind with all this. So okay, so I just sold a home in a neighborhood.
[00:20:33] I am going to now farm the rest of that neighborhood. I want everybody to know that I just sold
[00:20:38] this home. I'm going to send them each a handwritten note through your company. We're going to slice
[00:20:44] up the neighborhood. There's going to have an aesthetically pleasing picture on the front so that
[00:20:48] they're going to want to display the card just like they would a birthday card on their mantle
[00:20:53] or on their thing because it's something that relates to their community. It's also cool looking
[00:20:58] and on the inside it's going to have a note with some sort of a value add in there an introduction
[00:21:04] and a QR code sticker which would then link them to a video. Maybe you using bomb bomb or
[00:21:12] loom or YouTube or whatever. You're recording some sort of video specific to that neighborhood.
[00:21:18] Like hey guys, I am so and so I just sold blah blah blah blah and I would love the opportunity
[00:21:24] to work with you. Here's some information about your mark or I can give you a market update or
[00:21:28] come up with some sort of message in the video and then and then your system is going to go in
[00:21:35] and also identify those homeowners. We're going to look we're going to solve for social media counts.
[00:21:41] We're going to pair them with any information that you can find and then you have an app that will
[00:21:48] allow you to then start to follow those people and you can start to then you know reach them in
[00:21:54] other mediums such as on the digital side. So you're saying the Trojan horse is the physical
[00:22:03] card that your team is doing but you guys aren't just the card company you're like oh we're
[00:22:07] going to go way way beyond that because now we're going to go from physical to digital.
[00:22:13] You got it and we were even inside of your app you'll even find optimized
[00:22:18] LinkedIn content that you can post directly onto your LinkedIn account or on Quora or other channels
[00:22:27] sure that positions you as the authority and that's all included in the platform. So it really is
[00:22:34] a holistic marketing platform and then on the back end I didn't want to give them the weeds
[00:22:40] too much but this is super cool so what happens is that follow up email sequence that I talked
[00:22:47] about after you send the handwritten note it's a very deliberate and intentional sequence that's
[00:22:54] been totally optimized and the first one the first one yet drips the first one is very simple the
[00:23:01] first email comes a week after our notes are sent did you get the note yeah kind of did you get
[00:23:06] the note and it says I fear I may have sent it to the wrong address I sent it here and it lists
[00:23:14] the person's address that gets an 8 to 12 percent response rate which for anyone sending cold
[00:23:19] email really it's amazing it people lose their minds when they use the platform because it's
[00:23:26] all been optimized so well now the second touch is even cooler so what we do is we use I've been using
[00:23:33] we collectively as a company I've been using chat GPT for two years now so we've really gotten a
[00:23:37] chance we've created tens of thousands of articles with it so we really know how to use it what we do
[00:23:43] is we take your bio as a REALTOR we combine that with information about the homeowners home everything
[00:23:52] from number of bedrooms to do they have a swimming pool you you name it okay with that month's
[00:23:59] market report for Toledo Ohio or whatever neighbor needs or what we what we do is we combine all
[00:24:07] and it creates a letter that says hey I sent you an email a week ago and just wanted to let you
[00:24:14] know that I really did my research and this is why I would love to have a conversation with you to
[00:24:21] at least get you a sense of what your home is valued at and then it says your home is this your home
[00:24:28] is that by the way I always love to add value here's what's happening in Toledo real estate market
[00:24:33] listings have been down 21% blah blah blah blah blah blah blah it's very organic feels very casual
[00:24:39] and it blows people's minds and that gets a really high response rate too so that's all part of the
[00:24:44] audience platform and I guess maybe the best part about all of this is it's to some degree automated
[00:24:51] right like there's manual review of course of of everything before it goes out so that you know
[00:24:56] to make sure that it's you know it's in alignment with the branding and and all of that but
[00:25:02] the idea that it really takes a lot of that leg wall takes all almost all of the leg work off
[00:25:07] of the agents plate and and you were saying at the beginning you know the one thing you can't get
[00:25:12] back as time right so this idea of this actually is I mean I can't even imagine how much time
[00:25:18] this would it would just incredible just for our audience the and and Jesse you'll know this
[00:25:26] but I believe the the average return rate on a on a on a on a physical mailer is like if you get
[00:25:34] 1% your genius like and so you're we're now talking about you know 10 times that possibly
[00:25:41] depending on on how you do it but it's all sequential right it's that these are not one-offs one-offs
[00:25:46] we find you know have a very limited return so we're talking about as a sequence so we're really
[00:25:52] just initiating sequence so your your team does all of this our team does all of it we even
[00:25:58] it's insane automatically detect when you list or sell a home and we trigger an email to you
[00:26:06] and we've already set up your campaign and what we do automatically programmatically is we take
[00:26:13] the home that you just listed or sold and then we take it the the cover image that you featured on
[00:26:20] Zillow or Realtor.com and if the home is not aesthetically pleasing which some are not necessarily or
[00:26:27] if it's the front of an apartment or whatever we apply a watercolor filter to it or an impressionistic
[00:26:33] filter to makes makes it look cool yeah look cool and then we give you some of our best performing
[00:26:39] just listed just sold templates you literally click on the link in the email it takes you directly
[00:26:44] to the map where we've already pre-selected the most likely to sell households around the house
[00:26:50] you just listed or sold which you can you can edit and change your heart's content and then within
[00:26:56] 30 seconds you can trigger a mailer to 100 200 households so what clients consistently tell us
[00:27:03] and they've used every solution in the book is just is the easiest fastest cheapest way to drive
[00:27:10] listings and and then to form deeper relationships with my sphere and that's what everyone wants
[00:27:17] one caveat in door is it's not for agents that want instant gratification right next time you have
[00:27:28] to be persistent you have to be consistent if you got a listing on our first mailer or second
[00:27:36] mailer it was probably just luck or the right place at the right time this is for agents that want
[00:27:41] to sell dramatically more homes over the coming years and this is not by the way this is not for folks
[00:27:47] that are just dabbling in real estate we're really just a hobby these this is really the audience
[00:27:53] platform is for agents that are super ambitious and want to make this a career and want to form real
[00:28:01] deep relationships with the folks in their in their farm and sphere and so do the agents have direct
[00:28:08] editorial control over over the content so they can put their final approval and touches on it in
[00:28:14] case you know there's certain things that your team wouldn't know to put in 100 percent so you
[00:28:20] can go right into the app and do that there's like a million ways to contact us you can go to
[00:28:26] audience help.com and there's someone right there on a live zoom and then we have a large very
[00:28:32] talented customer success group so we can work with you one on one to make sure your campaign is
[00:28:37] perfect before it goes out by the way I want to just completely stop what we're talking about
[00:28:42] just to share one thing about Jesse that was very impressive to me which I want to give you a
[00:28:49] compliment because I can count also on one hand the number of times this particular strategy has
[00:28:56] has even come across my desk in the last since I started this podcast which was about six years ago
[00:29:03] so for all of our listeners one of the neat things about having a podcast that that people
[00:29:08] listen to is publicist find out about it and you just start getting blanketed with every guest
[00:29:14] request you can imagine which is very fun and cool and you don't have to go out looking for guests
[00:29:19] which is very helpful but it's also challenging because you get lots of guest requests you have to
[00:29:24] filter through they're almost 99.9 percent of them are our email based. Jesse did something very
[00:29:31] unusual and I think this is a really great lesson that you can take it's into your real estate
[00:29:39] practice and he did something very very cool he was down in his in one of his factories where his
[00:29:46] robots were in the process of writing cards you know and I've seen this before this isn't
[00:29:52] that this particular technology isn't actually new you know robots writing handwritten cards is not
[00:29:58] really all that unique however so he he was down in his in his workshop with all these different
[00:30:05] machines going around he was like hey man I want to be on your podcast here's all the things I can
[00:30:08] talk about and he literally didn't say like look at how cool our robots are he was like here's
[00:30:13] what I can do for your podcast here's what I can give to your listeners so he employed the same exact
[00:30:19] strategy that that he's actually suggesting you might want to use in this case you know with the
[00:30:25] QR code on the inside of the of the mailer that you send that goes to a video Jesse sent me a video
[00:30:32] and it literally was here's what I can do for you meaning here's how I can help your show
[00:30:38] and usually that's not the way pitches come across and immediately as soon as I saw it I just said
[00:30:43] book it immediately book it and and we reject most of the the the requests we get but because
[00:30:50] it felt like he was doing something special for me which he was he was making a video just for me
[00:30:56] and it had my name in it and all of that and I went gosh you know REALTOR should be doing more of
[00:31:02] these kind of a video messaging it's something that I you know if you're gonna text somebody turn
[00:31:10] the phone around make a little video message if I mean if it's just a text to which a one line
[00:31:14] text you don't have to but if you really want to say something to somebody turn the phone around
[00:31:18] send it as a you know as a text or as a video message boy that really got me and I just wanted to
[00:31:24] congratulate you for that that really caught my attention and and the other thing too is you're not
[00:31:30] just writing cards you have this entire platform most companies that do this just do the handwritten
[00:31:36] cards and and that's it you guys are like no no that's just the beginning we actually are using that
[00:31:42] as the as you say the Trojan horse to get in to sneak in under under the under the door and then
[00:31:49] we're gonna now we have everything and we're gonna be marketing you for it to you know indefinitely
[00:31:54] oh I appreciate that DJ that means means a lot to me and yeah so I would encourage
[00:32:00] anyone listening to just make sure that you like the best way to add value is to think about
[00:32:10] what are what do I do uniquely what do I know do I know pre-construction projects
[00:32:18] better than anybody else do I have you know a relationship with the head of admissions
[00:32:24] at private school in my in my area you know how is it that I can create content to give give give
[00:32:32] give and then get and then I think the mistake that I've noticed a lot of people
[00:32:37] make is when they do talk about what they know they it often comes off as preachy it often comes off as
[00:32:48] you should instead of I did and so you know Alex Ramosey talks about this a lot of you know Gary
[00:32:53] Vee and others and it's so important so easy to miss but the moment you say you should
[00:33:01] everybody tunes out right so that the difference like Alex Ramosey likes to talk about is you know
[00:33:07] you should have oatmeal for breakfast versus I had oatmeal for right right one's one's a judgment
[00:33:16] in the other's a statement a thousand percent and I know it sounds obvious but no it's a good it's a
[00:33:23] good one you'll immediately differentiate yourself from everyone I can tell you among the top
[00:33:28] realistid agents in in all of Miami his name is David Siddins he sold 600 million dollars in real
[00:33:35] estate last year very very talented guy and he is all about adding value and so he's constantly
[00:33:47] interviewing you know the important influencers and the neighborhood the heads of admissions for
[00:33:54] schools he's creating content on his blog and I really encourage everybody listening to not
[00:34:02] build their businesses on rented land and what I mean by that and I know I'm getting far afield from
[00:34:07] from handwritten notes but I told you I just wanted to add value is that even if you're with an
[00:34:11] amazing brokerage at Keller Williams eXp Douglas element whoever it is make sure that you build
[00:34:18] your own website and you build an amazing content by the way the brokerages will love this and
[00:34:25] your driving leads to that website building SEO building expertise authority and trust because who
[00:34:32] knows if you're going to be at that same brokerage 10 years from now and right the part of thing is
[00:34:37] to not build your business on rented land and by the way the brokerages love this because you know
[00:34:42] that you'll take so much ownership over your own website and you'll build that out and they'll
[00:34:47] only benefit that brokerage so all the content that you build think about at least the way that we
[00:34:53] do it is think about how can I add value how can I give give give and make sure you don't build that
[00:34:59] content on rented land i.e. on somebody else's platform yeah that's a good point because
[00:35:06] REALTORS move they move firms even if you're if you're listening now thinking I am never leaving my
[00:35:13] firm just assume that someday something happens and you have to move your firm so whether you want to
[00:35:18] or not when you have your own assets and you're not reliant upon the companies tools and technologies
[00:35:24] then you know a lot of times those go away when you when you move sometimes you can port them over to
[00:35:29] the new firm oftentimes you can't you want to build your own assets and that also becomes almost
[00:35:33] I think could be a way to leverage a higher commission split too if you're like hey I don't need
[00:35:39] your stuff I've got my own I you know that could become a point of negotiation when you're looking
[00:35:44] at other brokerages I wanted to ask you though about back to audience dot co which again I'm just
[00:35:50] completely my mind is spinning with all of these all of the services you guys offer let's talk ROI
[00:35:57] because everybody wants to know what's the ROI now obviously this you know what what are you usually
[00:36:03] seeing from your successful REALTOR clients yeah on average so we've done a retroactive
[00:36:11] analysis over the last two and a half years across thousands of agents so 18 month after 18 months
[00:36:19] it's about 16.2 x so what we do is we look at yeah what we look at are actual sales
[00:36:28] but not only actual sales because we're not the rooster taking credit for the sun rising so the
[00:36:33] easy thing to do would be to would be to be the the company that says oh yeah we sent a note to
[00:36:39] that homeowner and that homeowner listed and sold with you therefore we take a hundred percent credit
[00:36:44] for that sale no that would be the rooster taking credit for the sun rising so what we do is we go
[00:36:49] back to the REALTOR and say hey were we responsible it's kind of like in digital marketing first
[00:36:56] touch last touch like how do you do attribution modeling on just marketing channels so you have to
[00:37:01] be honest you can't sand off the truth and put varnish on so that's why we go to our REALTOR
[00:37:08] clients and we say yeah this is the manual part we're like did this it was this kind of us yeah
[00:37:12] well many times it's you know it's never one thing right it would be arrogant of me to say
[00:37:20] that we you know the handwritten note was the reason why they listed their $5 million
[00:37:24] home you know or whatever value home no it's a combination of things and that's why we offer in our
[00:37:31] platform this integration this digital handshake you have to follow the user journey from the mailbox
[00:37:39] to the inbox so to speak you have to follow them from the note to where they are which is digital
[00:37:45] and so that's that's what we do and so we we ask our REALTOR clients um estimate but to what extent
[00:37:53] did we assist in the sale and sometimes it's 10% sometimes it's 50% sometimes it's 80% but we take
[00:38:01] that percentage and we multiply it across everybody and we use we throw out the high and the low and
[00:38:07] we use statistical analysis and then we come up with the number which is after 18 months of working
[00:38:13] with audience 16.2 you spend a dollar with us you're gonna get 16 $16.20 back and but the caveat is
[00:38:22] you have to do the follow up the fortune the fortune is in the follow up yeah not work with us
[00:38:28] if you don't use the whole it's not a set and forget no no nothing is any marketer any channel that says
[00:38:37] that you're gonna you're gonna you know lose lose fat while you sleep or you know or
[00:38:43] or gain muscle mass while you sleep run over yeah we're a huxley we're not that we're we're a very
[00:38:49] powerful integrated marketing platform but you do you do have to follow up like anything boy um
[00:38:56] you're you're it i i think i think the industry is needed a pro a service like this and it sounds
[00:39:02] like i'm doing a commercial for you and i'm i'm not um although if you ever do need someone to
[00:39:06] do a convert non teasing but um but but seriously i i i've been in this industry for 13 years and
[00:39:12] i've yet to see this exact um process from from sort of a to z and it also incorporating AI
[00:39:19] which um which of course is is big in the news right now i think so many of our real
[00:39:25] tears have probably been on chat gbt and gbt and tried tried a few things and then gone okay i
[00:39:30] don't totally know what to do with this yet um i like that you guys have been working with it for years
[00:39:34] and have actually sort of extracted out some of the best sort of best practices for your particular
[00:39:41] sequences and this idea of because like i know for me when i when i use chat gbt oftentimes it's
[00:39:47] it's good for like certain things um it's not it's only gonna get smarter though it's only gonna
[00:39:52] get more sophisticated but you know right now if i'm like oh you know if i well anyway i've
[00:39:59] done i've done lots of different experiments with it i find it very interesting but i i use it
[00:40:03] in a pretty dumb way i don't really know how to elegantly extract good data out of there you guys
[00:40:10] have been doing this for years so you do know how to do that so like if i say hey write me a
[00:40:16] persuasive recruiting email for this REALTOR that i want to recruit to our firm
[00:40:19] it doesn't come back with anything too impressive because i'm not really giving it
[00:40:23] uh uh a very super specific question i'm just sort of thinking hey just kind of search around
[00:40:29] online find something that that you think might make sense and it comes back but it helps maybe
[00:40:34] with creativity helps some starting points but it isn't really uh set and forget product right now
[00:40:40] it's just kind of like maybe gives me a few ideas um but what you guys have done is actually
[00:40:45] you've done all the heavy lifting to determine this works this doesn't work here are the metrics
[00:40:50] you're all um you know objectively based so you're you're looking across the board at the numbers
[00:40:57] and i mean gosh if i could get a 16 times return on every dollar i spend on anything
[00:41:04] i would be a pretty happy person so this isn't an inexpensive platform however of course but it
[00:41:10] shouldn't be and of course it wouldn't be for 16 times return and of course it's not going to be
[00:41:16] inexpensive but that's why this you know i can't even imagine the amount of time and energy and
[00:41:22] money you guys have invested into this entire system um if anyone wants to learn more a audience
[00:41:28] dot CEO is the place to go um Jesse what what else should agents okay let's let's let white white
[00:41:36] the slate clean for a second i want to talk specifically about instagram and facebook only because
[00:41:42] i think REALTORS tend to live on instagram and facebook on with their social media lives
[00:41:48] ticktocks becoming more prevalent for REALTORS but i still think most agents are hanging out
[00:41:54] on instagram and maybe then facebook you know i don't know which probably instagram's doing a little
[00:41:59] bit more traffic than then facebook for REALTORS he says but i don't know um what are agents doing wrong
[00:42:05] and what would you recommend that maybe they could make a slight shift or a major shift that would
[00:42:11] they get better results from yeah so two words vertical video this is the first time in the history
[00:42:22] of the commercial internet and the history of social media that where you can take one format and
[00:42:31] distributed out natively to all the platforms so instagram is now native vertical video so that
[00:42:39] is holding your phone up like a phone it's not landscape so holding your phone up and shooting
[00:42:45] a video a video walking around the neighborhood a video of a listing a video of a of a you know
[00:42:52] new construction you name it right that's vertical video as produced or unproduced as you want to
[00:42:59] make it you can then distribute that out to instagram natively twitter natively facebook and of course
[00:43:10] the most important up-and-comer uh tiktok and so people just think oh isn't tiktok for selling you
[00:43:18] hoodies to 14-year-olds not at all it's so beyond that there's hundreds of really forward looking
[00:43:27] REALTORS who are silently crushing it on tiktok because it's underpriced attention because there's
[00:43:35] very few people there so what i always look for are the opportunities where there aren't many
[00:43:41] people there and you've got two to three-year runway now on tiktok and the beauty is you can use
[00:43:48] uh social media management software tool like a hoot suite h-o-o-t
[00:43:55] sure
[00:43:55] free
[00:43:55] right and you can use that tool shoot your vertical video and then you can blast it out and guess what
[00:44:02] i bet some of you are thinking well youtube isn't that landscape no youtube shorts which you
[00:44:08] may have noticed if you're a youtube consumer youtube shorts which are a minute or less that's all
[00:44:13] native vertical so the world is going native vertical video and it's really really important to get
[00:44:21] on that bandwagon the last thing i'll say is 800 to thousand word articles on linkedin
[00:44:29] carrush it and you can do wow on linkedin okay on linkedin crush so algorithmically linkedin
[00:44:34] has never been about video and i can talk to you about why because of all of its back-end training
[00:44:39] and how they actually make their their money 800 to thousand word articles about your neighborhoods
[00:44:49] market reports and so forth try it and you at maximum of four hashtags on linkedin and you want
[00:44:56] to post these articles and then the key is you want to connect with as many people as you can like
[00:45:02] when you subscribe to audience we get you all the linkedin profiles of all homeowners in your
[00:45:08] farm so you've got those and then what you can do is you can use an automated tool like an
[00:45:13] octopus CRM which is a chrome extension to automatically connect to everyone on linkedin and
[00:45:20] then when you post your content they all see it so those two things vertical video and 800 to
[00:45:25] thousand word articles on linkedin i love it i'm gonna i you know it's funny i i'm gonna reach out
[00:45:31] Jesse to you because i want to explore doing vertical video for recruiting purposes for my
[00:45:38] arbrok rich so i want to talk about how to do that in in linkedin offline so i am excited this
[00:45:44] is one of the most exciting conversations i've i've had over the years i'm really really thrilled i
[00:45:49] really want everyone to think about their we know that REALTORS are dealing with lots of reactive
[00:45:57] stuff so all day long you're getting emails text phone calls you're getting just lots of messages
[00:46:03] of things you have to deal with in the moment to secure a deal deal with the current client
[00:46:09] you know and and all of that just is going to interrupt your day and take your time we know this
[00:46:14] it just happens happens to me i don't even practice real estate personally even though i have a license
[00:46:19] and but we have 800 agents here so i'm getting their their challenges all day long as well so i know
[00:46:25] the the challenges that REALTORS face one of the hardest things to do is to consistently
[00:46:30] eek out these marketing strategies and to be able to consistently get them running day in day out
[00:46:37] because let's face it you just got a lot of things to do turning this over to a company where you
[00:46:42] can just kind of oversee and make your final edits i think makes all the sense in the world
[00:46:47] this again this is what top agents are are using so audience.co is the place to go to learn about
[00:46:54] how this works again about a 16 times return on your investment after 18 months um yeah that's
[00:47:01] that's that's that's that's beating what i'm getting in the stock market by about a million miles
[00:47:06] so um this is um this is again it it's not we're not talking what we're really talking about is
[00:47:12] growing your brand and and by doing by utilizing tools like this this won't allow you to have more time
[00:47:18] to do what you do best which i think is is the more one-to-one intimate relationships you know the
[00:47:24] the vulnerable intimate sort of connections that you want to have with your clients this allows you
[00:47:30] to to do more of what you do best and speaking with clients hanging out with them you know meeting
[00:47:35] their needs allow Jesse and his team to do all the other backend stuff so that you guys can you can
[00:47:42] do what you do best so i i'm a huge fan go to audience.co.jc is there anything else our our audience
[00:47:48] should know about about audience? yeah well i just wanted to uh recognize you and what you do
[00:47:56] as uh a perfect representation of the way that we like to guide our clients in terms of just
[00:48:05] add value add value add value it's the reason why one of the many reasons why kale is so successful
[00:48:11] is because of what you do DJ and so you are adding value guiding more helping more educating more
[00:48:21] solving problem more by just having experts on here myself notting i'm not positioning myself as
[00:48:28] an expert oh no you're an expert i think all the other REALTORS you have on here uh and others and so
[00:48:34] you really walk your talk and it's the reason why kale crushes it and is able to offer the kinds of
[00:48:40] amazing commissions versus its competition that it does and i just wanted to commend you for that
[00:48:45] thanks and and really grateful to all of our listeners as well for continuing to support this podcast
[00:48:52] please as you are as we're getting close to the end here please remember to tell a friend just think
[00:48:59] of one other REALTOR that is struggling with their marketing right now and but guess what in 2023
[00:49:04] all REALTORS are struggling in some way this is a tough year let's be honest about it and let's
[00:49:09] face it head on and let's think about that this is the time to actually step on the gas and do more
[00:49:14] a lot of agents are going to peel back because they're going to have to this is the year that you
[00:49:20] want to step on the gas and push forward and gain market share so audience dot co is the place to do
[00:49:26] that guys check it out it's really cool i i i don't have to to pitch anymore for jesse because he
[00:49:32] he did a perfect job himself but i want to become a customer and so i'm going to look into this
[00:49:37] for my own efforts of on recruiting so i'm going to be using the same strategies you will likely
[00:49:43] be using if you check out audience dot co so check out audience dot co jesse and his team are amazing
[00:49:48] their legit uh he's got the track record to back it up and all the metrics and data so jesse thank

Thanks, TJ, for having me. It's an amazing pedigree. Your background, your Vite, as they stay. I love reading back. And I would really, you know, this is a more unusual episode for us. So traditionally, we're normally we're speaking just to real estate agents about how they became successful. And very rarely do we talk to sort of experts out tangentially related to real estate, but not specifically out there producing. But I'm really excited to chat with you because you've been a digital marketer for, oh gosh, 20 plus years. And I am excited to learn some of your sort of success secrets and what you might suggest our audience start paying attention to in 2023. Likewise, really excited to add value to you guys. You can get your money back, but you can't get your time back. So I really appreciate all the listeners here. And I just want to add, I just want to add value. Great. Yeah. Well, let's start. I would love to hear about the start of your digital marketing journey. Like how did you get into the digital marketing space? I'd just graduated from Wharton in the late 90s and right place, right time, beginning of the commercial internet, New York City. I was just married, started a company called Soho Digital, which you had mentioned and grew it into a $30 million interactive agency sold it in 2005. And they're really learned how to build sales funnels by online media and do SEO. And all that became the foundation really for my digital marketing career. And after that, I got into domaining after I sold that you'd mentioned that. So I bought hobbies.com, biking.com, boating.com, yawning.com, all these like really category defining domain names. And the plan was to take these domain names and build them into full fledged businesses, the way that you would buy beachfront real estate and build a condo tower. But the one that really took off was sportsmemorbiliate.com. And bought that as completely raw domain in 2005. And with a group of people imminently smarter and more talented than me, which is a common thread that runs through my career, we built it into the biggest autograph store on the internet, top 500 internet retailer, and we sold it to fanatics in 2013. And along the way, I built with business partners, a skincare company to $50 million sold in 2009. And that was all direct to consumer via internet. And then started diet spotlight.com, which became one of the biggest nutrition and diet websites on the internet. And at sportsmem, we were sending handwritten notes to our customers. And we noticed that the customers that received the handwritten notes, now I'm kind of sagwaying into audience.co, which is the company that sends handwritten notes on behalf of REALTORS to help them drive more listings. And we combine the handwritten notes with digital marketing. So it's really cool. We use the handwritten note as a Trojan horse. But at sportsmemorbiliate.com, we were sending notes. And we noticed that the clients that received notes spent way more money with us. So if someone had bought a lecture starting, yeah, they sent way more money, spent way more money with us, but there was no scale to it. Because we were having warehouse workers and consultants and admin staff send the notes. The handwriting was often embarrassing. So there was no scale to it. We were waiting for someone to do this. And so three years ago, hired a team of software engineers, and we built these robots and the software. And they hold pins and they write precisely like humans. And we can go into that more DJ. But that's kind of the genesis of my digital marketing career. Well, that's really fasting. So I want to go back to the handwritten note, just sort of metric that you were mentioning that you noticed that so somebody would buy something. They buy a piece of sportsmemorbiliate. You'd write a hey, thanks for being a customer. We really appreciate it. You know, someone would write it. Maybe it would look nice. Maybe it wouldn't. But regardless, those people would then return and spend more money. That's exactly right. We noticed there was a direct correlation between and we would run these AB tests where the control group would be the customers that didn't receive notes. And then we take a look at the lifetime value of the customers that did. And it was just way beyond any kind of statistical probability. Those that receive notes spent way more money were more loyal, left better reviews were happier clients and so on and so forth. But again, there was no scale to it. And that was key. And then there was no combination with the note, original marketing, which is absolutely critical, which I can talk about a little bit later on in the show if you want. Yeah, that's fascinating. I think this idea of the return to pen and paper is, well, I don't know that we've returned to pen and paper. I don't know that we'll ever return to pen and paper as a society. But there is something maybe even more magical these days about receiving a handwritten note. I can count on one hand the number of handwritten notes I receive from anyone. You know, outside of birthday cards and things. But just in a year, maybe I get three or four, maybe that's even high. But every single time I do receive what I believe to be as a handwritten note, whether it's helped with robots with pens or if it's somebody actually using their hand, I read every single word because I don't know. I guess we're just hardwired to sort of appreciate that more. I'm not even sure exactly why that captures my attention more than an email. But we all know just intrinsically that it does. And it's also a lost art, something that, you know, obviously, you know, a lot of industries have moved very far away from. But there is something very, I would say connecting about handwritten notes. It feels intimate and it feels special and it makes the other person feel very, yeah, very grateful, I'd say. So curious to get your thoughts on why handwritten notes. Why do you think that's working so well? Yeah, just like anything, when you zoom in, the devil's in the details. So it's the way that we engineer the note. And then the key is the way that we combine it with AI and digital marketing, which I'll talk about in a second and all the components are key, just like, just like anything. So what we do with the note is we print it, I'm just holding up, obviously, the people listening, we'll be able to see this. But we print it on a fixed.card. There's, as it turns out, there's an ideal character length. So you want your notes, whether you work with us or whether you try it yourself, you want your handwritten notes, if you're a REALTOR, to be right around 650 characters. This is enough character length to be able to tell your story about, for example, how you just listed 17 Chestnut Street in Toledo, Ohio. And you can even include us a short market report there as well in the 650 characters. And then what you want to do is you want to create a graphic on the front of the note that aligns with the neighborhood. So it'd be a local landmark. And then you want to apply a filter to the graphic to make it aesthetically pleasing, like a water color or an impressionistic filter. And then you want your note card to be, we've learned all this through trial and error. You want your note card to be a bifold note. So what it does is, so the card is bifold. And of course, the envelope is handwritten as well. But never use pre-canceled stamps. So the temptation is to save a little bit of money by using the pre-canceled stamp. As it turns out, people really notice that. So use a real first-class post-stamp, cost of 62 cents. Hand that will get that will get the note from the mailbox to the kitchen counter. Okay. And then it'll optimize for open rate, which is great. So you have it open. But now they crack it open. They pull out the note. And it needs to be aesthetically pleasing. So they open the note. They see something a landmark that they recognize and that a landmark that is likely to make them feel good about their community or wherever their geographical location. So they see something they recognize in a cool way with a cool filter on it. That's on the cover. And then they're like, oh, I know what that is. And then they, and by the way, we're really talking in this particular example about a cold mail. So somebody receives a handwritten note on a heavy stock, a real stamp, not a stamp machine. They open it up. They see something they recognize. They still don't really know what it is. They open it up. And okay, I just wanted to sort of catch our audience. Absolutely. Absolutely. So and we can also talk to how do you use these notes? Again, whether you work with us or whether you try it yourself, how you use notes for both geographic farming and to nurture your sphere. So there's two different ways. For example, Tom Ferry, who's seen every single real-state tool on Earth, decided to invest in us. And he's a very happy client. So as Chris Heller, who you've interviewed, he's a Shermer, Steve of Keller Williams, you can ask all these people. You can go to our site. There's dozens and dozens of testimonials from top agents. Feel free to reach out to any of them. But they've opened the envelope. They take out the note. They read it. There should be no bait and switch element whatsoever to to the note or any of the marketing you do for that matter. And remember, in general, your marketing should be about adding value, right? About guiding more, about educating more, about helping more, about serving more, about mitigating and answering questions more than any other REALTOR in your neighborhood. So that's why our template library, which is vast, and we've sent millions of millions of notes. So we know precisely the note templates that work depending upon the touch. So you've just sold a house. We know what touch number one needs to look like. Touch number three. And in general, the common thread that runs through everything we do is it's all about adding value. It's all about educating. It's all about helping that homeowner make the right decision whether they go with you or not. So they've opened, they've taken the the note out. They've noticed the beautiful graphic. They've read it. And then what's really important is to include a QR code sticker on there. And you can't print the QR code sticker. You need to actually have a real sticker. You can't just print the QR code on there because that looks mechanical. Right. And it's sort of the whole thing sort of falls apart at that point. Yeah. You got it. Yeah, the illusion kind of falls apart. So make sure that the stamp on the front of the envelope is slightly off-kilter. Make sure that QR code sticker is slightly off-kilter. And what you want to do is you want to record a short either a YouTube video or a video that's on your brokerage website that is not personalized to the individual homeowner because that's way too much work. But personalize it to their neighborhood. Hey, greetings, Kibiskein resident. Thank you. Greetings, Kibiskein resident. Thank you so much for scanning my note. I just wanted to include a little market report. Let you know I've listed a few homes in your area. I'm at your service. I give, give, give, give, then get later. So it's all about adding value. So you add the value, you have the QR code sticker, then here's the real power of the notes and the real secret. Twofold. Number one, you can now use the note as a Trojan horse to market to that homeowner in a variety of different ways. Okay, that's why I named the company Audienst.co. I didn't name it something old school with handwriting or addresses or something else because I knew it's all about taking a cold audience and it's about warming up that audience. So now you can even go door knocking if that's your thing. You can next time you see them at a networking event and by the way run this experiment, send a hundred of our handwritten notes or do them yourself to a hundred household, go door knocking, you will be completely blown away at how receptive and warm and welcoming those homeowners are because you've generated the most important thing of all, which is reciprocity. You have sent them a beautiful aesthetically pleasing note that guess what, you've optimized for the second secret, which is they've kept and displayed it. So the decision to sell on its home is a really high consideration, high dollar amount, very, very among the biggest decisions any consumer ever makes. So what are the chances that they're actually going to be interested in what's in their home on the day you send the note? Very, very soon. Yeah, zero. Zero. So as it turns out, handwritten notes and I've been a marketer now for almost 25 years. This is the one medium that defies the time space continuum. And let me explain next, that sounds a little bit esoteric. There as long as you make it aesthetically pleasing and engineer it in the way I've talked about with a thick stock note, the bifold note, the note will end up on their kitchen counter. We'll end up on their home office desk. We'll end up even on the refrigerator and magnet, even on their mantle. And they will remember you. And they'll have a warm feeling. And they will feel the sense of reciprocity. And so when they are interested in selling their home, you are absolutely going to be top of mind. I don't care if you're new to the farm. If someone else has been farming that neighborhood for generations, the fact that you took the time to send these beautiful handwritten notes with the real first class posted stamp will resonate. Then use them as a Trojan horse. So what you want to do now, and what our platform does is we find, first of all, our lead filtering database makes it so we only send notes to the most likely to sell households. So when we have map functionality where you can freehand draw and you can literally take a scalpel out and get super surgical with your lead. So if you listed at home at 17 Chestnut Street, you can then hit surrounding households with our notes, but only the households that are most likely to sell. So we have 200 plus filters. You can filter by owner age, equity level, how long ago the COO was issued, and so on and so forth. Then what we do is we find all the email addresses of all, this is my digital marketing background comes in. We find all the email addresses of all the primary and secondary owners. We find all their LinkedIn profiles and we find all their other social handles. And then we have an app that you go to and you automatically follow up. So it's using the note as a Trojan horse a week later from our system, the homeowner gets an email with a subject line that says, did you receive my handwritten note? And this will double or triple response. So response is typically all in after all of our follow up between 3 and 5%, which is 10 to 12 times a response of normal direct. Yeah, yeah, exceptional. That's exceptional. So let's go through the I want to go through the workflow again because this is this you're kind of blowing my mind with all this. So okay, so I just sold a home in a neighborhood. I am going to now farm the rest of that neighborhood. I want everybody to know that I just sold this home. I'm going to send them each a handwritten note through your company. We're going to slice up the neighborhood. There's going to have an aesthetically pleasing picture on the front so that they're going to want to display the card just like they would a birthday card on their mantle or on their thing because it's something that relates to their community. It's also cool looking and on the inside it's going to have a note with some sort of a value add in there an introduction and a QR code sticker which would then link them to a video. Maybe you using bomb bomb or loom or YouTube or whatever. You're recording some sort of video specific to that neighborhood. Like hey guys, I am so and so I just sold blah blah blah blah and I would love the opportunity to work with you. Here's some information about your mark or I can give you a market update or come up with some sort of message in the video and then and then your system is going to go in and also identify those homeowners. We're going to look we're going to solve for social media counts. We're going to pair them with any information that you can find and then you have an app that will allow you to then start to follow those people and you can start to then you know reach them in other mediums such as on the digital side. So you're saying the Trojan horse is the physical card that your team is doing but you guys aren't just the card company you're like oh we're going to go way way beyond that because now we're going to go from physical to digital. You got it and we were even inside of your app you'll even find optimized LinkedIn content that you can post directly onto your LinkedIn account or on Quora or other channels sure that positions you as the authority and that's all included in the platform. So it really is a holistic marketing platform and then on the back end I didn't want to give them the weeds too much but this is super cool so what happens is that follow up email sequence that I talked about after you send the handwritten note it's a very deliberate and intentional sequence that's been totally optimized and the first one the first one yet drips the first one is very simple the first email comes a week after our notes are sent did you get the note yeah kind of did you get the note and it says I fear I may have sent it to the wrong address I sent it here and it lists the person's address that gets an 8 to 12 percent response rate which for anyone sending cold email really it's amazing it people lose their minds when they use the platform because it's all been optimized so well now the second touch is even cooler so what we do is we use I've been using we collectively as a company I've been using chat GPT for two years now so we've really gotten a chance we've created tens of thousands of articles with it so we really know how to use it what we do is we take your bio as a REALTOR we combine that with information about the homeowners home everything from number of bedrooms to do they have a swimming pool you you name it okay with that month's market report for Toledo Ohio or whatever neighbor needs or what we what we do is we combine all and it creates a letter that says hey I sent you an email a week ago and just wanted to let you know that I really did my research and this is why I would love to have a conversation with you to at least get you a sense of what your home is valued at and then it says your home is this your home is that by the way I always love to add value here's what's happening in Toledo real estate market listings have been down 21% blah blah blah blah blah blah blah it's very organic feels very casual and it blows people's minds and that gets a really high response rate too so that's all part of the audience platform and I guess maybe the best part about all of this is it's to some degree automated right like there's manual review of course of of everything before it goes out so that you know to make sure that it's you know it's in alignment with the branding and and all of that but the idea that it really takes a lot of that leg wall takes all almost all of the leg work off of the agents plate and and you were saying at the beginning you know the one thing you can't get back as time right so this idea of this actually is I mean I can't even imagine how much time this would it would just incredible just for our audience the and and Jesse you'll know this but I believe the the average return rate on a on a on a on a physical mailer is like if you get 1% your genius like and so you're we're now talking about you know 10 times that possibly depending on on how you do it but it's all sequential right it's that these are not one-offs one-offs we find you know have a very limited return so we're talking about as a sequence so we're really just initiating sequence so your your team does all of this our team does all of it we even it's insane automatically detect when you list or sell a home and we trigger an email to you and we've already set up your campaign and what we do automatically programmatically is we take the home that you just listed or sold and then we take it the the cover image that you featured on Zillow or Realtor.com and if the home is not aesthetically pleasing which some are not necessarily or if it's the front of an apartment or whatever we apply a watercolor filter to it or an impressionistic filter to makes makes it look cool yeah look cool and then we give you some of our best performing just listed just sold templates you literally click on the link in the email it takes you directly to the map where we've already pre-selected the most likely to sell households around the house you just listed or sold which you can you can edit and change your heart's content and then within 30 seconds you can trigger a mailer to 100 200 households so what clients consistently tell us and they've used every solution in the book is just is the easiest fastest cheapest way to drive listings and and then to form deeper relationships with my sphere and that's what everyone wants one caveat in door is it's not for agents that want instant gratification right next time you have to be persistent you have to be consistent if you got a listing on our first mailer or second mailer it was probably just luck or the right place at the right time this is for agents that want to sell dramatically more homes over the coming years and this is not by the way this is not for folks that are just dabbling in real estate we're really just a hobby these this is really the audience platform is for agents that are super ambitious and want to make this a career and want to form real deep relationships with the folks in their in their farm and sphere and so do the agents have direct editorial control over over the content so they can put their final approval and touches on it in case you know there's certain things that your team wouldn't know to put in 100 percent so you can go right into the app and do that there's like a million ways to contact us you can go to audience help.com and there's someone right there on a live zoom and then we have a large very talented customer success group so we can work with you one on one to make sure your campaign is perfect before it goes out by the way I want to just completely stop what we're talking about just to share one thing about Jesse that was very impressive to me which I want to give you a compliment because I can count also on one hand the number of times this particular strategy has has even come across my desk in the last since I started this podcast which was about six years ago so for all of our listeners one of the neat things about having a podcast that that people listen to is publicist find out about it and you just start getting blanketed with every guest request you can imagine which is very fun and cool and you don't have to go out looking for guests which is very helpful but it's also challenging because you get lots of guest requests you have to filter through they're almost 99.9 percent of them are our email based. Jesse did something very unusual and I think this is a really great lesson that you can take it's into your real estate practice and he did something very very cool he was down in his in one of his factories where his robots were in the process of writing cards you know and I've seen this before this isn't that this particular technology isn't actually new you know robots writing handwritten cards is not really all that unique however so he he was down in his in his workshop with all these different machines going around he was like hey man I want to be on your podcast here's all the things I can talk about and he literally didn't say like look at how cool our robots are he was like here's what I can do for your podcast here's what I can give to your listeners so he employed the same exact strategy that that he's actually suggesting you might want to use in this case you know with the QR code on the inside of the of the mailer that you send that goes to a video Jesse sent me a video and it literally was here's what I can do for you meaning here's how I can help your show and usually that's not the way pitches come across and immediately as soon as I saw it I just said book it immediately book it and and we reject most of the the the requests we get but because it felt like he was doing something special for me which he was he was making a video just for me and it had my name in it and all of that and I went gosh you know REALTOR should be doing more of these kind of a video messaging it's something that I you know if you're gonna text somebody turn the phone around make a little video message if I mean if it's just a text to which a one line text you don't have to but if you really want to say something to somebody turn the phone around send it as a you know as a text or as a video message boy that really got me and I just wanted to congratulate you for that that really caught my attention and and the other thing too is you're not just writing cards you have this entire platform most companies that do this just do the handwritten cards and and that's it you guys are like no no that's just the beginning we actually are using that as the as you say the Trojan horse to get in to sneak in under under the under the door and then we're gonna now we have everything and we're gonna be marketing you for it to you know indefinitely oh I appreciate that DJ that means means a lot to me and yeah so I would encourage anyone listening to just make sure that you like the best way to add value is to think about what are what do I do uniquely what do I know do I know pre-construction projects better than anybody else do I have you know a relationship with the head of admissions at private school in my in my area you know how is it that I can create content to give give give give and then get and then I think the mistake that I've noticed a lot of people make is when they do talk about what they know they it often comes off as preachy it often comes off as you should instead of I did and so you know Alex Ramosey talks about this a lot of you know Gary Vee and others and it's so important so easy to miss but the moment you say you should everybody tunes out right so that the difference like Alex Ramosey likes to talk about is you know you should have oatmeal for breakfast versus I had oatmeal for right right one's one's a judgment in the other's a statement a thousand percent and I know it sounds obvious but no it's a good it's a good one you'll immediately differentiate yourself from everyone I can tell you among the top realistid agents in in all of Miami his name is David Siddins he sold 600 million dollars in real estate last year very very talented guy and he is all about adding value and so he's constantly interviewing you know the important influencers and the neighborhood the heads of admissions for schools he's creating content on his blog and I really encourage everybody listening to not build their businesses on rented land and what I mean by that and I know I'm getting far afield from from handwritten notes but I told you I just wanted to add value is that even if you're with an amazing brokerage at Keller Williams eXp Douglas element whoever it is make sure that you build your own website and you build an amazing content by the way the brokerages will love this and your driving leads to that website building SEO building expertise authority and trust because who knows if you're going to be at that same brokerage 10 years from now and right the part of thing is to not build your business on rented land and by the way the brokerages love this because you know that you'll take so much ownership over your own website and you'll build that out and they'll only benefit that brokerage so all the content that you build think about at least the way that we do it is think about how can I add value how can I give give give and make sure you don't build that content on rented land i.e. on somebody else's platform yeah that's a good point because REALTORS move they move firms even if you're if you're listening now thinking I am never leaving my firm just assume that someday something happens and you have to move your firm so whether you want to or not when you have your own assets and you're not reliant upon the companies tools and technologies then you know a lot of times those go away when you when you move sometimes you can port them over to the new firm oftentimes you can't you want to build your own assets and that also becomes almost I think could be a way to leverage a higher commission split too if you're like hey I don't need your stuff I've got my own I you know that could become a point of negotiation when you're looking at other brokerages I wanted to ask you though about back to audience dot co which again I'm just completely my mind is spinning with all of these all of the services you guys offer let's talk ROI because everybody wants to know what's the ROI now obviously this you know what what are you usually seeing from your successful REALTOR clients yeah on average so we've done a retroactive analysis over the last two and a half years across thousands of agents so 18 month after 18 months it's about 16.2 x so what we do is we look at yeah what we look at are actual sales but not only actual sales because we're not the rooster taking credit for the sun rising so the easy thing to do would be to would be to be the the company that says oh yeah we sent a note to that homeowner and that homeowner listed and sold with you therefore we take a hundred percent credit for that sale no that would be the rooster taking credit for the sun rising so what we do is we go back to the REALTOR and say hey were we responsible it's kind of like in digital marketing first touch last touch like how do you do attribution modeling on just marketing channels so you have to be honest you can't sand off the truth and put varnish on so that's why we go to our REALTOR clients and we say yeah this is the manual part we're like did this it was this kind of us yeah well many times it's you know it's never one thing right it would be arrogant of me to say that we you know the handwritten note was the reason why they listed their $5 million home you know or whatever value home no it's a combination of things and that's why we offer in our platform this integration this digital handshake you have to follow the user journey from the mailbox to the inbox so to speak you have to follow them from the note to where they are which is digital and so that's that's what we do and so we we ask our REALTOR clients um estimate but to what extent did we assist in the sale and sometimes it's 10% sometimes it's 50% sometimes it's 80% but we take that percentage and we multiply it across everybody and we use we throw out the high and the low and we use statistical analysis and then we come up with the number which is after 18 months of working with audience 16.2 you spend a dollar with us you're gonna get 16 $16.20 back and but the caveat is you have to do the follow up the fortune the fortune is in the follow up yeah not work with us if you don't use the whole it's not a set and forget no no nothing is any marketer any channel that says that you're gonna you're gonna you know lose lose fat while you sleep or you know or or gain muscle mass while you sleep run over yeah we're a huxley we're not that we're we're a very powerful integrated marketing platform but you do you do have to follow up like anything boy um you're you're it i i think i think the industry is needed a pro a service like this and it sounds like i'm doing a commercial for you and i'm i'm not um although if you ever do need someone to do a convert non teasing but um but but seriously i i i've been in this industry for 13 years and i've yet to see this exact um process from from sort of a to z and it also incorporating AI which um which of course is is big in the news right now i think so many of our real tears have probably been on chat gbt and gbt and tried tried a few things and then gone okay i don't totally know what to do with this yet um i like that you guys have been working with it for years and have actually sort of extracted out some of the best sort of best practices for your particular sequences and this idea of because like i know for me when i when i use chat gbt oftentimes it's it's good for like certain things um it's not it's only gonna get smarter though it's only gonna get more sophisticated but you know right now if i'm like oh you know if i well anyway i've done i've done lots of different experiments with it i find it very interesting but i i use it in a pretty dumb way i don't really know how to elegantly extract good data out of there you guys have been doing this for years so you do know how to do that so like if i say hey write me a persuasive recruiting email for this REALTOR that i want to recruit to our firm it doesn't come back with anything too impressive because i'm not really giving it uh uh a very super specific question i'm just sort of thinking hey just kind of search around online find something that that you think might make sense and it comes back but it helps maybe with creativity helps some starting points but it isn't really uh set and forget product right now it's just kind of like maybe gives me a few ideas um but what you guys have done is actually you've done all the heavy lifting to determine this works this doesn't work here are the metrics you're all um you know objectively based so you're you're looking across the board at the numbers and i mean gosh if i could get a 16 times return on every dollar i spend on anything i would be a pretty happy person so this isn't an inexpensive platform however of course but it shouldn't be and of course it wouldn't be for 16 times return and of course it's not going to be inexpensive but that's why this you know i can't even imagine the amount of time and energy and money you guys have invested into this entire system um if anyone wants to learn more a audience dot CEO is the place to go um Jesse what what else should agents okay let's let's let white white the slate clean for a second i want to talk specifically about instagram and facebook only because i think REALTORS tend to live on instagram and facebook on with their social media lives ticktocks becoming more prevalent for REALTORS but i still think most agents are hanging out on instagram and maybe then facebook you know i don't know which probably instagram's doing a little bit more traffic than then facebook for REALTORS he says but i don't know um what are agents doing wrong and what would you recommend that maybe they could make a slight shift or a major shift that would they get better results from yeah so two words vertical video this is the first time in the history of the commercial internet and the history of social media that where you can take one format and distributed out natively to all the platforms so instagram is now native vertical video so that is holding your phone up like a phone it's not landscape so holding your phone up and shooting a video a video walking around the neighborhood a video of a listing a video of a of a you know new construction you name it right that's vertical video as produced or unproduced as you want to make it you can then distribute that out to instagram natively twitter natively facebook and of course the most important up-and-comer uh tiktok and so people just think oh isn't tiktok for selling you hoodies to 14-year-olds not at all it's so beyond that there's hundreds of really forward looking REALTORS who are silently crushing it on tiktok because it's underpriced attention because there's very few people there so what i always look for are the opportunities where there aren't many people there and you've got two to three-year runway now on tiktok and the beauty is you can use uh social media management software tool like a hoot suite h-o-o-t sure free right and you can use that tool shoot your vertical video and then you can blast it out and guess what i bet some of you are thinking well youtube isn't that landscape no youtube shorts which you may have noticed if you're a youtube consumer youtube shorts which are a minute or less that's all native vertical so the world is going native vertical video and it's really really important to get on that bandwagon the last thing i'll say is 800 to thousand word articles on linkedin carrush it and you can do wow on linkedin okay on linkedin crush so algorithmically linkedin has never been about video and i can talk to you about why because of all of its back-end training and how they actually make their their money 800 to thousand word articles about your neighborhoods market reports and so forth try it and you at maximum of four hashtags on linkedin and you want to post these articles and then the key is you want to connect with as many people as you can like when you subscribe to audience we get you all the linkedin profiles of all homeowners in your farm so you've got those and then what you can do is you can use an automated tool like an octopus CRM which is a chrome extension to automatically connect to everyone on linkedin and then when you post your content they all see it so those two things vertical video and 800 to thousand word articles on linkedin i love it i'm gonna i you know it's funny i i'm gonna reach out Jesse to you because i want to explore doing vertical video for recruiting purposes for my arbrok rich so i want to talk about how to do that in in linkedin offline so i am excited this is one of the most exciting conversations i've i've had over the years i'm really really thrilled i really want everyone to think about their we know that REALTORS are dealing with lots of reactive stuff so all day long you're getting emails text phone calls you're getting just lots of messages of things you have to deal with in the moment to secure a deal deal with the current client you know and and all of that just is going to interrupt your day and take your time we know this it just happens happens to me i don't even practice real estate personally even though i have a license and but we have 800 agents here so i'm getting their their challenges all day long as well so i know the the challenges that REALTORS face one of the hardest things to do is to consistently eek out these marketing strategies and to be able to consistently get them running day in day out because let's face it you just got a lot of things to do turning this over to a company where you can just kind of oversee and make your final edits i think makes all the sense in the world this again this is what top agents are are using so audience.co is the place to go to learn about how this works again about a 16 times return on your investment after 18 months um yeah that's that's that's that's that's beating what i'm getting in the stock market by about a million miles so um this is um this is again it it's not we're not talking what we're really talking about is growing your brand and and by doing by utilizing tools like this this won't allow you to have more time to do what you do best which i think is is the more one-to-one intimate relationships you know the the vulnerable intimate sort of connections that you want to have with your clients this allows you to to do more of what you do best and speaking with clients hanging out with them you know meeting their needs allow Jesse and his team to do all the other backend stuff so that you guys can you can do what you do best so i i'm a huge fan go to audience.co.jc is there anything else our our audience should know about about audience? yeah well i just wanted to uh recognize you and what you do as uh a perfect representation of the way that we like to guide our clients in terms of just add value add value add value it's the reason why one of the many reasons why kale is so successful is because of what you do DJ and so you are adding value guiding more helping more educating more solving problem more by just having experts on here myself notting i'm not positioning myself as an expert oh no you're an expert i think all the other REALTORS you have on here uh and others and so you really walk your talk and it's the reason why kale crushes it and is able to offer the kinds of amazing commissions versus its competition that it does and i just wanted to commend you for that thanks and and really grateful to all of our listeners as well for continuing to support this podcast please as you are as we're getting close to the end here please remember to tell a friend just think of one other REALTOR that is struggling with their marketing right now and but guess what in 2023 all REALTORS are struggling in some way this is a tough year let's be honest about it and let's face it head on and let's think about that this is the time to actually step on the gas and do more a lot of agents are going to peel back because they're going to have to this is the year that you want to step on the gas and push forward and gain market share so audience dot co is the place to do that guys check it out it's really cool i i i don't have to to pitch anymore for jesse because he he did a perfect job himself but i want to become a customer and so i'm going to look into this for my own efforts of on recruiting so i'm going to be using the same strategies you will likely be using if you check out audience dot co so check out audience dot co jesse and his team are amazing their legit uh he's got the track record to back it up and all the metrics and data so jesse thank you so much for being on our show you've been an amazing hour really appreciate you and um yeah and for everyone else again tell a friend leave us a review to let
