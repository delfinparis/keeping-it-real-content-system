[00:01:27] Today's episode is brought to you by corded.io. Are you looking for agents to join your brokerage
[00:01:33] team? Now as a real estate recruiter, I can tell you the answer is always yes. But most agents
[00:01:39] aren't looking to move right now. So how do you know who to contact? Well, what if I were to tell
[00:01:44] you there's a recruiting and retention tool powered by artificial intelligence that shows you
[00:01:49] exactly which agents in your local market are looking to leave their brokerage right now and
[00:01:55] which agents at your own firm are also looking to leave you. Now I've been recruiting real tours
[00:02:00] for 15 years and I've hired over 2000 agents. I can tell you with no exaggeration, this is the
[00:02:07] tool I've been waiting for. Corded's AI looks for trends across dozens of variables for each agent
[00:02:12] in your market and shows you which agents they believe are likely to move. Not only does it do
[00:02:17] that, but corded's AI went and visited my recruiting website and read everything I offer. So now
[00:02:23] when I'm recruiting, corded's AI tells me exactly what to say based on that agent's needs and what
[00:02:30] my brokerage can offer. It even writes emails for me. I've never seen anything like it and I use it
[00:02:35] every single day. Now if you are looking to grow your brokerage corded.io is the best tool out there.

[00:03:02] Hey guys, Michelle Barnard Michael here and this is going to be a unique episode where we're
[00:03:08] going to talk about how to combine your passions and your pain points into building better content
[00:03:15] for your platform. Now I get asked all the time, Michelle, why are our passions so important in our
[00:03:20] content? I thought people wanted to know the data and the metrics and the things that matter to
[00:03:25] people in the real estate and mortgage space or the interest rates or what my production was or am I
[00:03:31] in the top 1%? I thought those are the things I'm supposed to be sharing and the reality is that that's
[00:03:37] just not true and I'm not saying that the data doesn't matter and I'm not saying that sharing
[00:03:42] metrics like these things don't add value but what I am telling you is that we have to find a
[00:03:49] better way to share that information. Now no better or more fitting way to start this episode than
[00:03:56] to share with you guys a statistic of all things. Now before I do so though, I want you guys to go
[00:04:02] back to when you were in college and think about your favorite class, think about your favorite
[00:04:07] professor. Why is that person your favorite person or why was that your favorite professor in the
[00:04:13] first place? And most likely if you ask yourself that question, there is likely a story associated
[00:04:20] with that person or something that that person shared with you whether that be a personal
[00:04:25] story, whether that be a personal experience or some form of connection point that you had with
[00:04:31] that individual that makes that person stand out. Now I can tell you I went to college for four
[00:04:36] years and I don't even know that I could really tell you the name of a single professor except for one
[00:04:42] and the one that I specifically remember more than any of the rest was one of my journalism
[00:04:48] professors actually and it was my creative writing class that I took right before I actually
[00:04:54] transitioned into being a journalist major and in this creative writing class not only did he
[00:05:00] himself also share a similar story to me about how he started off in college with the emphasis
[00:05:07] on physical therapy and the idea of kind of going into this science space much like his family had.
[00:05:14] Now for context, my dad is a bankruptcy lawyer and my mom was a paralegal my sister is a high school
[00:05:18] biology and chemistry teacher and it's just there everybody's just super smart and very focused on
[00:05:24] the science side and the business or law side and for me I tried to start off of a physical therapy
[00:05:31] side and the reality was is that it just wasn't who I am it's not my superpower and it wasn't what
[00:05:38] I felt like my calling was and the reason this professor stands out so much is because he took the
[00:05:44] time to make me feel like he was actually listening to me and like he saw me and in addition to that
[00:05:53] right when I sat with him at the end of my class he told me the story of a very similar experience
[00:05:59] that he had had and we were very bonded by this experience I ended up changing my major very
[00:06:05] shortly after and became one of the first journalism students to minor in a science and I ended up
[00:06:12] choosing to graduate with a degree in journalism and psychology and a minor in a weird form of science
[00:06:20] for that's another conversation for another day but the point is that this particular professor
[00:06:25] really stood out to me because he connected with me and found a way to actually make me feel heard
[00:06:31] and seen so why am I telling you that and why is this the story that's so relevant because when we
[00:06:37] produce content on social media it is really really important that we lead with this connection point
[00:06:42] and that we don't just get on camera and say hi my name is so and so and I'm going to talk to you
[00:06:47] about how mortgage rates are the lowest they've been or the refinances are up x percent right because
[00:06:52] we can't lead with that we have to lead with the passion aspect so what do I mean what does this
[00:06:57] look like how do you do it now the fastest easiest way to describe this to you guys is when we create
[00:07:04] value series content which is a term that I've coined many many years ago and trademarked and
[00:07:10] what the value series is is the ability to create content or to create value through storytelling
[00:07:17] so the value series is one topic divided into five sub questions and each of those five sub
[00:07:23] questions becomes its own video of 40 to 60 seconds so you might be thinking well Michelle how do
[00:07:29] I tie passions and pain points into creating value well let me tell you so what I want you guys to do
[00:07:36] if you're listening to me here is create a t-graph and in that they're on that t-graph on one
[00:07:41] side I want you to list out three of your passions three of the things that you love the most now if
[00:07:46] you're going to say things like golf or if you're going to say something like Pilates or if you're
[00:07:50] going to say something like whatever x, y or z it might be remember that the idea here is I want
[00:07:56] you to list out why that is your passion and in addition to that what do you feel when you do such thing
[00:08:04] so for example I love CrossFit I am an avid crossfitter formerly competitive not so much anymore
[00:08:10] really just do it for the fitness aspect now but why do I love CrossFit so much and this actually
[00:08:16] became a revelation for me very very recently but the biggest reason for me that I love the CrossFit
[00:08:21] gym that I go to and and I love going is because when I walk into those doors I'm not Michelle
[00:08:27] Berman the CEO or Michelle Berman the business owner or Michelle Berman the national speaker
[00:08:31] I'm just Michelle Berman Michael the person right I'm the mom I'm the wife I'm the friend that
[00:08:36] loves working out I get to be Michelle without all of the labels and for me that's something that's
[00:08:42] really really powerful for my psyche and for my morale so that I can truly just let it all go and
[00:08:50] when I'm in the gym and when I'm at CrossFit that's that place for me so if you guys are going to write
[00:08:55] golf for example why do you love golf so much do you love the journey of it do you love the fact
[00:09:00] that you have to go to the driving range for hours and hours and hours to perfect one shot off the
[00:09:05] tee right what is it and then we're going to take that into how we build out these analogies so there
[00:09:11] is a method to my madness there so on one side of the tee graph you're going to list out all of these
[00:09:16] passions of yours and then on the other side of the tee graph I want you to list out all of your
[00:09:20] top pain points so if you are a real estate agent listening to this and you know who your ideal
[00:09:26] client is which hopefully by now you do and if not that might be another conversation that we need
[00:09:32] to have but you need to know who your ideal client is and I don't just mean saying first time home
[00:09:38] buyer or a move up buyer or someone that is buying a second home for themselves I mean really
[00:09:44] into the weeds of who that person really is for you and for me specifically again to continue
[00:09:49] office example my ideal client specifically would be a military family that is really into fitness
[00:09:56] therefore I can target those people in my prospecting efforts and in the value series content
[00:10:02] that I produce later on but if I can say that my ideal client is a military family that's really
[00:10:08] into fitness what are their pain points what are their issues what are the questions that they have
[00:10:13] and that's what goes on that side of the graph not pain points of yourself as the agent but pain
[00:10:19] points of your clients specifically and get very very specific as to who that person is for you and
[00:10:26] that will be really game changing into how we build these analogies now fast forward into how do we
[00:10:33] actually turn this into value series content and you have this tee graph passions and pain points
[00:10:37] on either side you are now going to combine those two things so we will get into chat you BT and we
[00:10:43] will build an analogy between the passion and the pain point and in doing so we will get a five part
[00:10:49] series so you obviously have to teach chat you BT this and there is a structure and a step-by-step
[00:10:54] quote-unquote if you will that you have to go through in order for this to happen but we will build
[00:10:59] an analogy between the passion and the pain point we will get a five part series out of it we will
[00:11:03] build video scripts based off of those five parts and the video script will be broken down into four
[00:11:09] main segments hook problem objection solution excuse me hook objection problem solution I got
[00:11:15] that backwards but once we have that built out so we have each of those five scripts for each video
[00:11:21] the key is that the hook that opening sentence of your video starts with the personal aspect
[00:11:29] front and center so if you're going to be talking about the difference between
[00:11:33] closing costs and your down payment and are they the same or are they different understanding that
[00:11:39] that if that phrasing is in your hook you don't want that to be the start of your hook you want the
[00:11:45] passion to be the front of the or at the front and center of the hook itself so that opening
[00:11:50] sentence should talk about whatever the passion is or that the golf aspect or the analogy of golf
[00:11:56] and pain point if your opening sentence talks immediately about real estate you haven't done your job
[00:12:03] very important there so the last thing about this that I really want you guys to pay attention to
[00:12:08] is once we build the analogy once we get the five parts once we break each of the five parts down
[00:12:13] into its own video script we now have this really beautiful series where we are leading with
[00:12:19] personal things great example is I just wrote a series for a client the other day who loves
[00:12:25] barbecuing so he's a hardcore barbecue or has three different types of smokers tons and tons and
[00:12:30] tons of different sides or smells and seasonings and all kinds of things that go into it and one of
[00:12:35] the main pain points for him that we discovered and this particular person happens to be a load officer
[00:12:41] but it's just a very relevant example but this particular load officer of mine his ideal client is
[00:12:46] a loyal REALTOR who can appreciate his vinesse and appreciate his attention to detail specifically
[00:12:54] in a certain religion quote unquote or not religion that's the wrong word specifically in a certain
[00:13:02] like sect meaning this particular person is a Christian so he's very focused on serving the
[00:13:07] Christian population and servicing Christian real estate agents in his area he's very integrated
[00:13:14] in the church he's very very involved in the church community he's served as a guest pastor many
[00:13:18] times at his church so for him his ideal client is a loyal REALTOR who really eats breathes
[00:13:25] sleeps and lives the Christian faith and so because of that there are specific pain points that are
[00:13:30] associated to those types of agents and that's what we broke down so we asked Chatship E.T. to build
[00:13:36] us an analogy between his love of smoking meat and having all these different flavors and seasonings
[00:13:41] and things that you wanted to add to it and that pain point now what happened is we kind of came up
[00:13:46] with a series related to sometimes you might try a specific seasoning and it doesn't turn out so
[00:13:51] good or the combination or the flavor profile isn't so great and that is so symbolic of how sometimes
[00:13:57] a real estate agent will choose a loan officer and maybe it's not the best combination maybe it's
[00:14:02] not the best relationship and that's okay right and so this particular loan officer when we built
[00:14:07] this series he was very moved by the analogy that it built out very excited about the
[00:14:13] relatability for his ideal audience and most importantly finally he was most excited about where
[00:14:19] he actually got to record this video series because he asked me he said Michelle can I do this
[00:14:25] outside in front of all my smokers can I get all my seasonings out can I wear my cross can I do
[00:14:30] all the things that make it feel like I'm really living in this series and I said 1000% why am I
[00:14:37] telling you this particular part really important not to miss this and many many of you guys will
[00:14:43] fall into this category so please turn your listening ears on right here but many of you guys are
[00:14:49] falling victim to posting talking head videos meaning you're sitting at your desk you're sitting
[00:14:56] outside you're just holding your phone in your face and recording and you're doing them in the same
[00:15:00] spot over and over and over again and likely you're doing it in a way where you're not really focused
[00:15:08] on the connection aspect you're sharing more of the data right you're focused on the data data data
[00:15:14] the more I show all of my knowledge of all of these things the more valuable I am and you're missing
[00:15:19] the point which is the very beginning of my story which is creating connection with your audience
[00:15:24] so my client that's going to go outside and record this entire series around barbecuing and all
[00:15:30] the different types of meats and how you couple it with different seasons and how to choose which
[00:15:33] flavor combination or profile makes the most sense based off of the cut of meat not only is it a
[00:15:39] more powerful series there's two big things that happen one more connection other people are going
[00:15:45] to watch that and say wow this is cool me too or no way I'd never thought of using x seasoning with
[00:15:51] x meat or no way I never would have thought about this this combination which then in turn creates
[00:15:57] more conversation on the platform for my client so my client will get more comments more dms more
[00:16:04] messages both facebook instagram it doesn't matter where you post it but your engagement will go up
[00:16:10] and that is so important to not miss on this conversation because that is the goal of this
[00:16:15] platform create connection which creates conversation more than anything but above all else
[00:16:22] why is the series so important and why is the structure of the series so important for you
[00:16:27] as the person creating it and the answer to that is you have to feel invested in what you're producing
[00:16:32] if you are ever feeling like I don't really know what I'm supposed to be posting I don't really know
[00:16:37] if this is doing anything I don't really know if this is valuable then you need to trust that if
[00:16:42] you create content in this format the way that I am teaching you you will be fired up about recording
[00:16:48] the video content that I am asking you to do and you'll be fired up about how it actually feels
[00:16:53] when you're recording it and most importantly you'll be really excited about the feedback that your
[00:16:59] audience gives you when you actually produce it so I hope that this was super super helpful and back
[00:17:06] in the very beginning of this video I said to you what do you remember about your professors and
[00:17:11] do you even remember a single one of them and I told you the story about how I remembered the
[00:17:15] single professor that really took that time to build a relationship with me directly how powerful
[00:17:22] is that so so symbolic of this real estate relationship that we need in order to overcome a very
[00:17:29] saturated marketplace on the social platforms so instead of sharing data share stories and you
[00:17:35] will see a dramatic increase in how the conversations play out and how you feel when you're actually
[00:17:42] producing it

Hey guys, Michelle Barnard Michael here and this is going to be a unique episode where we're going to talk about how to combine your passions and your pain points into building better content for your platform. Now I get asked all the time, Michelle, why are our passions so important in our content?

their issues what are the questions that they have and that's what goes on that side of the graph not pain points of yourself as the agent but pain points of your clients specifically and get very very specific as to who that person is for you and that will be really game changing into how we build these analogies now fast forward into how do we actually turn this into value series content and you have this tee graph passions and pain points on either side you are now going to combine those two things so we will get into chat you BT and we will build an analogy between the passion and the pain point and in doing so we will get a five part series so you obviously have to teach chat you BT this and there is a structure and a step-by-step quote-unquote if you will that you have to go through in order for this to happen but we will build an analogy between the passion and the pain point we will get a five part series out of it we will build video scripts based off of those five parts and the video script will be broken down into four main segments hook problem objection solution excuse me hook objection problem solution I got that backwards but once we have that built out so we have each of those five scripts for each video the key is that the hook that opening sentence of your video starts with the personal aspect front and center so if you're going to be talking about the difference between closing costs and your down payment and are they the same or are they different understanding that that if that phrasing is in your hook you don't want that to be the start of your hook you want the passion to be the front of the or at the front and center of the hook itself so that opening sentence should talk about whatever the passion is or that the golf aspect or the analogy of golf and pain point if your opening sentence talks immediately about real estate you haven't done your job very important there so the last thing about this that I really want you guys to pay attention to is once we build the analogy once we get the five parts once we break each of the five parts down into its own video script we now have this really beautiful series where we are leading with personal things great example is I just wrote a series for a client the other day who loves barbecuing so he's a hardcore barbecue or has three different types of smokers tons and tons and tons of different sides or smells and seasonings and all kinds of things that go into it and one of the main pain points for him that we discovered and this particular person happens to be a load officer but it's just a very relevant example but this particular load officer of mine his ideal client is a loyal REALTOR who can appreciate his vinesse and appreciate his attention to detail specifically in a certain religion quote unquote or not religion that's the wrong word specifically in a certain like sect meaning this particular person is a Christian so he's very focused on serving the Christian population and servicing Christian real estate agents in his area he's very integrated in the church he's very very involved in the church community he's served as a guest pastor many times at his church so for him his ideal client is a loyal REALTOR who really eats breathes sleeps and lives the Christian faith and so because of that there are specific pain points that are associated to those types of agents and that's what we broke down so we asked Chatship E.T. to build us an analogy between his love of smoking meat and having all these different flavors and seasonings and things that you wanted to add to it and that pain point now what happened is we kind of came up with a series related to sometimes you might try a specific seasoning and it doesn't turn out so good or the combination or the flavor profile isn't so great and that is so symbolic of how sometimes a real estate agent will choose a loan officer and maybe it's not the best combination maybe it's not the best relationship and that's okay right and so this particular loan officer when we built this series he was very moved by the analogy that it built out very excited about the relatability for his ideal audience and most importantly finally he was most excited about where he actually got to record this video series because he asked me he said Michelle can I do this outside in front of all my smokers can I get all my seasonings out can I wear my cross can I do all the things that make it feel like I'm really living in this series and I said 1000% why am I telling you this particular part really important not to miss this and many many of you guys will fall into this category so please turn your listening ears on right here but many of you guys are falling victim to posting talking head videos meaning you're sitting at your desk you're sitting outside you're just holding your phone in your face and recording and you're doing them in the same spot over and over and over again and likely you're doing it in a way where you're not really focused on the connection aspect you're sharing more of the data right you're focused on the data data data the more I show all of my knowledge of all of these things the more valuable I am and you're missing the point which is the very beginning of my story which is creating connection with your audience so my client that's going to go outside and record this entire series around barbecuing and all the different types of meats and how you couple it with different seasons and how to choose which flavor combination or profile makes the most sense based off of the cut of meat not only is it a more powerful series there's two big things that happen one more connection other people are going to watch that and say wow this is cool me too or no way I'd never thought of using x seasoning with x meat or no way I never would have thought about this this combination which then in turn creates more conversation on the platform for my client so my client will get more comments more dms more messages both facebook instagram it doesn't matter where you post it but your engagement will go up and that is so important to not miss on this conversation because that is the goal of this platform create connection which creates conversation more than anything but above all else why is the series so important and why is the structure of the series so important for you as the person creating it and the answer to that is you have to feel invested in what you're producing if you are ever feeling like I don't really know what I'm supposed to be posting I don't really know if this is doing anything I don't really know if this is valuable then you need to trust that if you create content in this format the way that I am teaching you you will be fired up about recording the video content that I am asking you to do and you'll be fired up about how it actually feels when you're recording it and most importantly you'll be really excited about the feedback that your audience gives you when you actually produce it so I hope that this was super super helpful and back in the very beginning of this video I said to you what do you remember about your professors and do you even remember a single one of them and I told you the story about how I remembered the single professor that really took that time to build a relationship with me directly how powerful is that so so symbolic of this real estate relationship that we need in order to overcome a very saturated marketplace on the social platforms so instead of sharing data share stories and you will see a dramatic increase in how the conversations play out and how you feel when you're actually producing it
