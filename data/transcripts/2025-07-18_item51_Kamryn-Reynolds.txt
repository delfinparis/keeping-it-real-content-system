[00:01:13] Today's episode is brought to you by Corded.io.
[00:01:17] Are you looking for agents to join your brokerage or team?
[00:01:20] Now, as a real estate recruiter, I can tell you the answer is always yes.
[00:01:24] But most agents aren't looking to move right now.
[00:01:27] So how do you know who to contact?
[00:01:29] Well, what if I were to tell you there's a recruiting and retention tool powered by
[00:01:33] artificial intelligence that shows you exactly which agents in your local market are looking
[00:01:38] to leave their brokerage right now and which agents at your own firm are also looking
[00:01:44] to leave you?
[00:01:45] Now, I've been recruiting REALTORS for 15 years and I've hired over 2,000 agents.

[00:01:59] and shows you which agents they believe are likely to move.
[00:02:03] Not only does it do that, but Corded's AI went and visited my recruiting website and
[00:02:08] read everything I offer.
[00:02:09] So now when I'm recruiting, Corded's AI tells me exactly what to say based on that
[00:02:15] agent's needs and what my brokerage can offer.
[00:02:17] It even writes emails for me.
[00:02:19] I've never seen anything like it and I use it every single day.

[00:02:50] Hello and welcome to another episode of Keeping It Real, the largest podcast made by real estate
[00:02:55] agents and for real estate agents.
[00:02:57] My name is DJ Paris.
[00:02:58] I'm your guide and host through the show.
[00:03:00] Welcome back to our returning listeners.
[00:03:02] Welcome to anyone new.
[00:03:04] We appreciate all of you and thank you for continuing to spread the word.
[00:03:08] Let other agents know about our show.
[00:03:10] We've been around now seven years and just crossed over seven million downloads all thanks
[00:03:15] to you.
[00:03:15] So again, my appreciation goes out to everybody.
[00:03:19] In a moment, I'm going to be speaking with communication expert Cameron Reynolds about
[00:03:24] how you can immediately improve your communication skills to get more deals, more authentically
[00:03:28] connect with your clients and have deeper and better relationships.
[00:03:33] So before we get to that, just as a quick reminder, if you haven't reviewed our podcast
[00:03:37] on whatever app you're listening to us on, we would appreciate it.
[00:03:40] Go ahead and give us a star review.
[00:03:42] Let us know what you think of the show helps us out a lot.
[00:03:45] And again, please continue to tell all the agents in your office about this great podcast.
[00:03:50] Oh, one last thing.
[00:03:51] Cameron and I had a slight communication error ourselves.
[00:03:55] This was just a technology thing.
[00:03:56] So you'll hear there's a little bit of a delay towards the end of the podcast where
[00:04:00] he and I aren't totally in sync.
[00:04:02] I apologize for that.
[00:04:03] No unfortunate fix, but you'll still be able to get unbelievable value and I can't wait
[00:04:08] for you to listen.
[00:04:09] So let's just jump right to it.
[00:04:10] My conversation with Cameron Reynolds.
[00:04:25] What is the best piece of advice you ever have heard or anyone gave you around communication?
[00:04:34] The best piece, one of my big mentors, not a real mentor, more like a fake mentor.
[00:04:40] I learn a lot from him.
[00:04:41] Is Vin John.
[00:04:43] He's the agent who is all over social media with communication, he's the magician.
[00:04:50] And he always talks about frames.
[00:04:52] And then I found this is very common in a lot of communication.
[00:04:54] When I was really getting into it, the beginning, it was all about the frames and how to structure
[00:05:00] your ideas so they come out better.
[00:05:03] They come out more clear.
[00:05:04] They come out easier to understand rather than that garbled mess that you have in your
[00:05:07] head.
[00:05:08] So that's probably the best.
[00:05:09] I love that.
[00:05:11] And what is one mistake that drives you nuts that people or what's the number one mistake
[00:05:17] people make around communication?
[00:05:20] The number one mistake that's killing your effectiveness inside of communication.
[00:05:25] The best way to describe this is one of my college professors.
[00:05:31] Amazing, women super intelligent, very good teacher.
[00:05:36] New issue is talking about, but the way she talked, just put everybody to sleep, and
[00:05:43] what I mean by that is she would use the same exact tone and rhythm and pace and it would
[00:05:51] sound, nobody could pay attention.
[00:05:54] To give you an example, she would always be talking like this and she wouldn't stop
[00:06:00] and it was the exact same for 45 minutes and it never stopped doing anything.
[00:06:07] But this and it was horrible, the vocal dynamics.
[00:06:11] I just fell asleep by my second.
[00:06:13] I completely fell asleep.
[00:06:15] You lose everybody.
[00:06:16] You could be talking about absolutely nothing, but if it sounds interesting, you can keep
[00:06:20] people on.
[00:06:21] It doesn't, and it doesn't matter what you're talking about.
[00:06:24] You know, it does a perfect job of what you're talking about is NPR radio.
[00:06:30] NPR radio is funny because they use a very slow and calm mentality.
[00:06:35] They could say like today a fire took out an entire village, 300 people were dead, and
[00:06:42] you're like, oh, that sounds great.
[00:06:43] And then you're like, wait a minute, what?
[00:06:44] Yeah.
[00:06:45] So I totally understand.
[00:06:46] All right, Cameron Reynolds, he is our guest today.
[00:06:49] He is a communication coach, keynote speaker, and the founder of Articulate Advantage,
[00:06:54] which is a coaching firm helping professionals master their voice and turn conversations
[00:06:59] into opportunities.
[00:07:01] Before I tell you a little bit more about Cameron, I want to make a big play for this.
[00:07:05] If you, it really whatever profession you're in, if you're listening to this, you're almost
[00:07:10] assuredly a REALTOR, I promise you that this is so important and it's so much beyond
[00:07:17] what you say.
[00:07:18] We're going to talk a lot about how you say things.
[00:07:20] We just discussed a little bit of that with tonality.
[00:07:24] And we're going to talk about frames, as Cameron mentioned.
[00:07:26] I promise you, this is so important and it's something that never gets talked about.
[00:07:31] But more about Cameron, he is a lifelong student of human connection.
[00:07:34] Cameron combines the science of influence with the art of authenticity to help business
[00:07:39] owners build trust, earn referrals, and grow with intention.
[00:07:42] He's trained entrepreneurs, sales teams, and service professionals all across the country
[00:07:46] with a focus on practical storytelling, confident delivery, and referral-based growth.
[00:07:52] While he's not coaching or speaking, when he's not coaching or speaking, Cameron serves
[00:07:56] as an executive director for BNI, which many of you listening are probably members of,
[00:08:01] where he helps chapters grow through stronger presentations and strategic relationships.
[00:08:06] His unique perspective and energy have earned him stages at national conferences and today
[00:08:11] he's here to share the frameworks and mindset shifts that make referrals a natural outcome
[00:08:16] of genuine connection.
[00:08:19] I believe fully that the real estate business is a relationship business and referrals
[00:08:26] come from the deepest of those relationships.
[00:08:30] I want, we're going to talk about that today.
[00:08:31] I want everybody to visit Cameron's website at ArticulateAdvantaged.com.
[00:08:35] Again, ArticulateAdvantaged.com will have a link to that in the show notes and follow
[00:08:41] him on social.
[00:08:42] That is Cameron underscore Ray.
[00:08:44] That's K-A-M-R-Y and underscore R-E-Y.
[00:08:48] We'll have a link to all of his social and his social accounts as well as his website.
[00:08:53] Cameron, welcome.
[00:08:55] Thank you.
[00:08:56] I feel welcome.
[00:08:58] Thank you.
[00:08:59] I will tell you as a sort of thing to the audience that I use my voice sometimes to make
[00:09:07] myself sound more interesting than I really am and a little bit of enthusiasm or excitement
[00:09:12] really does have a tremendous impact well beyond the words I'm saying.
[00:09:17] I am so excited to talk to you about this today.
[00:09:21] Before we get into sort of the practical ways of utilizing communication strategy, I want
[00:09:26] to learn about your story.
[00:09:28] How did you get into this?
[00:09:30] That's a great question.
[00:09:31] There's the more purposeful why and then there's the series of events why.
[00:09:39] But the more purposeful why is growing up, I was never the most athletic.
[00:09:44] I was never the smartest, never the best looking and so I had to be able to talk and it certainly
[00:09:50] really well throughout high school, getting on to tick-tock, doing random things with my
[00:09:54] friends, whatever I thought was funny at the time and getting hundreds of thousands of
[00:09:57] followers.
[00:09:59] But as soon as I graduated high school, I turned 18 and I decided to drop everything I've
[00:10:06] ever known and serve a mission trip in Argentina for a couple of years and going from my number
[00:10:14] one thing is to be able to communicate and talk to people to living in a country in this
[00:10:19] small town of a couple thousand people with dirt streets and it's called the windy city
[00:10:24] of Argentina.
[00:10:25] It's called Zapala, it's the name of the town where I couldn't communicate with anybody.
[00:10:31] I couldn't connect with anybody because I didn't know the language and I didn't know the
[00:10:36] culture and that was huge and before that point, I never knew what depression was like because
[00:10:43] all it was to me was when a girl in high school, the guy they like didn't like them back
[00:10:47] and they're like, oh my gosh, I'm depressed and I'm like, oh my goodness, get over yourself.
[00:10:52] The sun is in the sky.
[00:10:53] There's food on your table, there's roof over your head, life is good, depression is fake.
[00:10:59] But when I felt completely alone in a country, on this other side of the world, I really got
[00:11:08] to understand what that felt like, to really be depressed to have no connection with anybody
[00:11:14] for months until I finally was able to learn how to speak, getting the culture because I'd
[00:11:21] be in rooms full of people, but the worst part is I'd feel completely alone until I
[00:11:28] relearned how to communicate from the ground up in a different language with different
[00:11:32] culture, different hand movements, different face movements.
[00:11:35] So that gave me a deeper appreciation for it.
[00:11:37] When I got back, being inside of B&I, presenting, speaking, I was like, man, yeah, this is great.
[00:11:44] And then I realized, not everybody is great at this.
[00:11:47] And I see so many people who I can just tell they felt like I did back when I lived
[00:11:52] in Argentina where they would feel completely alone, even though they're surrounded with
[00:11:57] people.
[00:11:58] So that's really why I do what I do is to help people connect because connection, man,
[00:12:04] if you don't have connection, life's hard.
[00:12:06] Yeah, and with connection, life is worth living, I think.
[00:12:09] There's where we're wired for connection.
[00:12:12] The data is pretty clear on that.
[00:12:15] We're not meant to be alone.
[00:12:16] And in order to, I think about this a lot with, I'll give you an example, a personal example
[00:12:21] with my girlfriend.
[00:12:22] So we're in the stages of going to figuring out the rest of our lives.
[00:12:27] And we've worked on our communication specifically around conflict because conflict is the hardest
[00:12:34] part of any relationship and it's inevitable.
[00:12:37] It's just part of the deal.
[00:12:38] And everyone's got different rules, but also everyone's got different communication
[00:12:42] styles and strategies.
[00:12:43] And some people when they get into conflict, they withdraw and that's what they need.
[00:12:47] And they need to go away and kind of process.
[00:12:49] Other people want to confront and have a more spirited conversation or try to work it out
[00:12:55] in the moment.
[00:12:56] Right?
[00:12:57] These are all different ways of getting to the same end, which is some sort of resolution.
[00:13:01] And we work on this because of course we're two different human beings from different
[00:13:05] backgrounds, different communication styles in our families growing up.
[00:13:10] And now it's like, hey, we better figure this out because, and we need to practice it so
[00:13:15] that when we do get into conflict and we do, of course, everyone does, we have a process
[00:13:21] for reconnection.
[00:13:22] And that a lot of it has to do with how, oftentimes it's not about what we're arguing.
[00:13:27] Like what we're arguing is fairly trivial.
[00:13:29] It's just, you know, whatever it's an argument about something usually not that important.
[00:13:34] But we can get very heated and very upset about it.
[00:13:37] And that doesn't really serve us.
[00:13:39] So we have processes that we've studied about how to exactly do this.
[00:13:44] So I use it practically in my home life, but I also see so much potential to use it in
[00:13:51] business world as well or just to deepen friendships even.
[00:13:56] You know, so I'm such a fan of this.
[00:13:57] Let's dive in.
[00:13:58] So let's double down on that, the connection piece because it's so important and everything
[00:14:05] we do.
[00:14:06] Have you ever heard of the rat park?
[00:14:09] No.
[00:14:09] There was this whole research study into rat park.
[00:14:13] So as this research study, originally to define and really understand addiction and what
[00:14:21] they did is they took a rat and they got a cage and they put the rat in the cage with
[00:14:26] two different water bottles.
[00:14:27] One was just normal water and one was water laced with either heroin or crack depending
[00:14:31] on the day.
[00:14:33] And this rat every single time would go to the drug water and would overdose every time.
[00:14:42] And so scientists and the people who studied this, they drew a lot of conclusions from
[00:14:49] that.
[00:14:49] And they said, if the chemical hooks are strong enough, we will get hooked.
[00:14:52] We will eventually overdose.
[00:14:54] It overpowers us.
[00:14:56] And that's a lot of what we understand about addiction today.
[00:14:59] But then there was this other researcher who looked at that and he said, yeah, but let's
[00:15:08] try a couple other things.
[00:15:09] And so eventually he made this cage and he called it rat park.
[00:15:13] And this cage was filled with colorful balls and tunnels and toys.
[00:15:17] But most importantly, there was other rats.
[00:15:21] And so when they put the rat in, the test rat, they again had the two water bottles.
[00:15:25] They had the water and they had the drug water.
[00:15:28] And what they found was crazy.
[00:15:29] What they found was that 0% of the time that a single rat overdose, not once that it
[00:15:37] happened.
[00:15:38] And even crazier is none of the rats even liked the drug water.
[00:15:42] None of them went back to it having that community.
[00:15:47] The reality was better.
[00:15:49] He drew the conclusion.
[00:15:49] The reality was better than escape.
[00:15:51] Yeah.
[00:15:53] Of course.
[00:15:54] And so he drew the conclusion from this of what if the chemical hook isn't the thing that
[00:16:01] gets us, what if it's a lack of connection that leads to addiction?
[00:16:05] Because there's lots of different things that we get addicted to, whether it's our phones
[00:16:08] or drugs or food or sugar.
[00:16:11] And so it's that connection that is fundamental to so many things we do as humans.
[00:16:16] And that's just the exacerbated example of it.
[00:16:19] And in order.
[00:16:20] I just wanted to get that in there because I think it's fascinating.
[00:16:22] And in order to have connection, you need to be an effective communicator.
[00:16:27] You just do.
[00:16:28] And it's something that very few people study.
[00:16:30] It's a lot easier.
[00:16:31] Yeah, very few people study at all.
[00:16:33] And it's something that can, there are small tweaks that people can make.
[00:16:39] And you know these because you teach them about how to be more effective, how to connect
[00:16:44] with others more effortlessly.
[00:16:47] And just, you know, so let's dive into it.
[00:16:50] So let's, let's, where do you want to start?
[00:16:56] Oh, let's start with, you know, building on connection, how to connect better authenticity.
[00:17:01] I know this is huge for you.
[00:17:02] I was looking at your LinkedIn profile, prepping for this podcast.
[00:17:05] And I know that on yours, you said you have a line about authenticity.
[00:17:08] Do you remember what it is?
[00:17:11] Oh my goodness.
[00:17:12] I got to, I'm going to something about trying to be authentic.
[00:17:14] I don't know, hopefully.
[00:17:17] Oh, it's something amazing.
[00:17:18] Let me see.
[00:17:19] Oh, wow, I appreciate you flattery.
[00:17:22] It'll get you.
[00:17:25] It'll get you pretty far.
[00:17:26] Not going to lie.
[00:17:27] But it was talking about like authenticity, authenticity is your superpower or something
[00:17:31] like that or something, right?
[00:17:34] The importance of authenticity.
[00:17:36] And the biggest thing about it is authenticity can't be faked.
[00:17:41] It's kind of in the definition of authenticity.
[00:17:46] As humans, we just understand when somebody's being authentic or when they're not.
[00:17:51] It's just that gut feeling.
[00:17:53] And if they're not authentic, you just don't connect because you always have that feeling
[00:17:57] of, what are they hiding?
[00:18:00] Are they keeping something back, right?
[00:18:01] You just feel the lack of authenticity.
[00:18:04] So building that in, man, if you don't have that, that's that's step one.
[00:18:10] That is step one is having an authentic personality, one, but then having an authentic
[00:18:17] why?
[00:18:17] Because this podcast, primarily, primarily I should say, is for REALTORS.
[00:18:22] And so as a REALTOR, if you're just doing it, you know, because you want to sell houses,
[00:18:27] you want to make money, you want to dictate your own schedule, how you do things when you
[00:18:31] do things where you do them, you could have success.
[00:18:34] But it's the REALTORS that connect with their clients who have an authentic purpose and
[00:18:41] they express that and everything they do.
[00:18:44] Those are the REALTORS that have clients for generations who sell the second, third home,
[00:18:49] they sell the kids home, they buy the condo off at college.
[00:18:52] Those, that's the real difference between just the REALTOR that sold me my house a couple
[00:18:58] years ago and the family friend who is one of us is that authentic connection.
[00:19:07] Yeah, I agree.
[00:19:08] It's, you're absolutely right.
[00:19:09] And you see this a lot in social media with for REALTORS where there's some agents that
[00:19:15] will post really just their, their wins, which would be just sold this home, just listed
[00:19:21] a property, whatever.
[00:19:22] And those are fine, you know, I guess it's nice to celebrate your, your, your wins.
[00:19:26] But the agents that talk more authentically about their lives and talk about maybe even
[00:19:34] their struggles or certainly the things that are passionate to them, maybe around real estate
[00:19:40] or maybe in their personal life, those agents, we know we, we want to connect with, with someone's
[00:19:46] authenticity because I think the reason is, is because there's an honesty to it that we trust.
[00:19:53] So once we believe somebody's authentic, we don't have to worry about whether they're
[00:19:59] a trustworthy person or not.
[00:20:00] I think there's an inherent level of trust that's just kind of associated with that.
[00:20:05] So there's, there's something to be, yeah, I think there's something to be said about
[00:20:09] figuring out how to project authenticity because you might be an authentic person, but your
[00:20:16] communication skills might not be up to par and that authenticity might not be coming
[00:20:21] through even though you are an ethical honest, good human being.
[00:20:26] So I want to talk also about, you know, what are some ways that people could increase the,
[00:20:33] the way they project authenticity?
[00:20:35] Is there any suggestions you have?
[00:20:38] Absolutely.
[00:20:39] There's a lot of body language tricks to that.
[00:20:45] It's like everything right there is tricks, but it has to come from the right place.
[00:20:50] It's like same thing, we're going to talk about authenticity, but same thing when it comes
[00:20:53] to however good you are at your job, however intelligent, however smart you are, people
[00:20:59] perceive you at the level of your communication, not at the level of your capability.
[00:21:03] Which is called, let's save that again, save that again, repeat that.
[00:21:08] People perceive you at the level of your communication, not at the level of your capability.
[00:21:14] For good or for bad, it's true.
[00:21:16] And so this is the same in authenticity.
[00:21:18] People are only as authentic as they communicate themselves.
[00:21:21] Now this isn't just words.
[00:21:23] This is also body language, this is an action.
[00:21:25] Everything you do is how you present yourself as how you communicate.
[00:21:30] So you always hear one of the biggest tips and tricks for that is being open, open body
[00:21:34] language, not being close to off, not folding your arms always, but being open, taking
[00:21:39] up space, being comfortable because then we're comfortable you are.
[00:21:42] A lot of times it means you don't have anything to hide.
[00:21:46] You're open, you're comfortable, you feel safe.
[00:21:50] So it's easier for the rest of the things to happen to be authentic.
[00:21:54] Another one is infuse emotion into what you're doing because you have these people where
[00:22:00] they always just want to talk about the facts and the dates and how things happen and what
[00:22:04] happened versus putting emotion into it.
[00:22:09] Right, these are the people of when you say, oh, how you doing?
[00:22:12] They say good.
[00:22:13] There's no authentic.
[00:22:15] There's nothing authentic about it.
[00:22:17] By the way, good is it really.
[00:22:19] Yeah, good doesn't tell me much.
[00:22:22] Good tells me nothing bad is happening, but it doesn't tell me how you're really doing.
[00:22:27] Right.
[00:22:27] And it might mean nothing bad is happening or just might mean they don't want to talk
[00:22:31] about it, right?
[00:22:31] Zero authenticity inside of good.
[00:22:36] Yeah.
[00:22:37] And so
[00:22:37] that give good answers.
[00:22:39] I'll tell you one little tip that I learned many years ago was because I'm quick to talk
[00:22:47] and interrupt and that's not great communication skills, but I have that sort of mind that just
[00:22:54] kind of does that.
[00:22:55] And so I have to purposefully pause when someone asks me a question and really reflect
[00:23:03] before I answer.
[00:23:05] And that also demonstrates authenticity because it's like, hmm, that's a great question.
[00:23:12] Let me think about it.
[00:23:13] Let me pause.
[00:23:14] It's respectful and it's flattering in a sense to the other person who asked it because you're
[00:23:19] taking it in, you're thinking about it, you're reflecting and then you're responding.
[00:23:24] And that is something I
[00:23:26] Yeah.
[00:23:27] Absolutely.
[00:23:28] And what it shows them and I can see that you're this type of person is you care what
[00:23:32] they're talking about.
[00:23:33] You're not just giving some answer to get to the next thing.
[00:23:36] You actually care what they're saying.
[00:23:38] You care about how you respond.
[00:23:41] And that is something very, very powerful for authenticity.
[00:23:44] And that's why you can see that DJ, you are an authentic person.
[00:23:47] And so that's why I think it really comes from you in that way.
[00:23:52] Yeah, thank you.
[00:23:53] I very much appreciate that.
[00:23:55] I have always found that there's an opportunity anytime we meet another human being.
[00:24:02] Everyone's passionate about something like it could be a hobby.
[00:24:05] It could be their personal life.
[00:24:07] It could be it whatever.
[00:24:08] Just they're into some underwater basket.
[00:24:10] We even know it could be.
[00:24:12] And and if someone's into that, I know I'm like, how did you get into that?
[00:24:17] Why did you get into that?
[00:24:18] Tell me what that does for you because I don't understand that at all.
[00:24:21] And I want to understand.
[00:24:24] I, but I love seeing
[00:24:27] whatever it is with somebody them light up.
[00:24:30] And people light up around at least one thing in their life.
[00:24:34] And very few people will ask them about that thing if it's like not known if they don't, you know.
[00:24:39] And so I always think conversations.
[00:24:43] Best conversations.
[00:24:44] Yeah.
[00:24:45] And so I just try to get curious.
[00:24:47] So I love, I think this is a great tip for anyone that if you're worried about what to, you know,
[00:24:53] how to communicate with somebody, get interested in what they're interested in.
[00:24:56] Find out what lights them up.
[00:24:59] That goes a long way into creating connection.
[00:25:02] Oh, so it's so huge.
[00:25:04] That just reminded me of this time.
[00:25:06] A couple months ago, I was on a plane ride between speaking events.
[00:25:12] And I sat down and normally just get on a plane ride and go to sleep or a watch a movie
[00:25:18] down, though, on my iPad.
[00:25:19] But this time I was sitting down in an exit row.
[00:25:22] And it was one of those where one of the crew, their seat was facing towards you backwards.
[00:25:26] I don't know if you've ever seen that.
[00:25:28] I was like, oh sure.
[00:25:29] And so I'm like, I could have some fun with this.
[00:25:32] And I sat there and we started to take off in this fight attendant.
[00:25:37] She sat down in front of me and I took my headphones off and I said, Hey, I'm Cameron.
[00:25:42] What's your name?
[00:25:43] Right.
[00:25:44] People over complicate introductions.
[00:25:46] Totally.
[00:25:47] Life is so simple when you treat it like you're all in preschool again.
[00:25:51] Hi, I'm Cameron.
[00:25:51] What's your name?
[00:25:52] She told me her name and all these things.
[00:25:54] And I said, so what made you want to be a flight attendant?
[00:26:00] Yep.
[00:26:00] And then she tells me all about it.
[00:26:02] And then she goes into a couple of questions later.
[00:26:04] She goes into her divorce and her kids and how her love is her dogs.
[00:26:09] And this trip she's going on in Italy, she's biking down the Italian coast and all of these things
[00:26:14] that she's super passionate because it wasn't like, Hey, you know, good flight.
[00:26:20] Wow.
[00:26:20] Yeah, super.
[00:26:21] How are you doing?
[00:26:21] Good.
[00:26:22] Oh, the weather's amazing.
[00:26:23] Right.
[00:26:24] Not to bash on small talk.
[00:26:26] A small talk definitely has its place.
[00:26:28] But when you can get to something somebody's passionate about, those are the fun conversations.
[00:26:33] But the small talk, I will say, small talk connects all of us, no matter who we are.
[00:26:39] Because we all love sunny days.
[00:26:41] We all love good food.
[00:26:42] We all hate traffic.
[00:26:44] And so it connects us on a small level.
[00:26:46] But it's the real conversations of finding emotion and passion that that's what deeply connects us.
[00:26:52] But it can also divide us more.
[00:26:55] If you've ever had that tabletop dinner of talking about politics or really
[00:27:00] with somebody who doesn't agree with you, right?
[00:27:03] For somebody, it could be the biggest connection you have for others that could be very dividing.
[00:27:08] So small talk connects us all, but it's that deep talk, that passionate conversation that connects us deeper.
[00:27:15] But only to someone.
[00:27:17] You know, but but you're so right.
[00:27:19] And the flight attendant and now stories are good one because you know flight attend flight attendants are often treated as
[00:27:27] you know workers or treated as problem solvers or I have a question.
[00:27:32] They're not necessarily treated as actual human beings in a sense of like I want to get to know you.
[00:27:38] And you know, they've got a job to do and they, you know, unless you're sitting across from them,
[00:27:42] you probably don't have a ton of opportunity to do what you did.
[00:27:44] But I'll bet you you're the only person that day that asked her, how'd you get into this?
[00:27:49] Like tell me about it.
[00:27:50] Like what do you like about it?
[00:27:51] You kept giving me free snacks and she wanted to give me like all these things that you had to pay for.
[00:27:55] She's like, Hey, do you want this?
[00:27:56] Do you want it?
[00:27:56] I'm like, no, okay.
[00:27:58] And after I got off, she's like, bye.
[00:28:00] And I'm like, bye.
[00:28:01] So it's just fun.
[00:28:02] People want to be connected with.
[00:28:05] You just have to do it in a way that's not creepy stalker vibes.
[00:28:10] And I always say you don't have to worry about looking like a creepy stalker if you're not a creepy stalker.
[00:28:18] Right?
[00:28:18] The only people that really need to worry about that are people that, you know, if you aren't that person, don't worry about it.
[00:28:26] Like the feedback will tell you.
[00:28:29] You will find out.
[00:28:31] 
[00:28:31] And, but, you know, it's, it is a thing that we are so not just divided because of our beliefs,
[00:28:38] but we are so removed because of technology that this idea of communication and connection is really more challenging, I think,
[00:28:48] because people aren't going up like you and speaking to the flight attendant across the way.
[00:28:54] They're like, Hey, I'm, I'm Cameron.
[00:28:56] Who are you?
[00:28:56] You know, like they don't, nobody does that.
[00:28:58] Yeah.
[00:28:58] And they, because they're busy, they're on their phones, they're whatever, they're sleeping.
[00:29:02] They're, and that's kind of how we move through life.
[00:29:04] And people are so starved for that kind of connection that it's not hard to do.
[00:29:11] As you said, hi, I'm Cameron.
[00:29:12] What's your name?
[00:29:13] Like it's literally that simple.
[00:29:15] And it will almost always result in a smile.
[00:29:19] Somebody's, you know, happy to, to meet you.
[00:29:22] You know, you have to pick your spots.
[00:29:23] Of course, it's like, you know, if you're a guy, don't do it to a woman while she's working out of the gym.
[00:29:28] Nobody wants that.
[00:29:28] She doesn't want that.
[00:29:29] But anywhere else you can do that.
[00:29:32] And say hi, I'm so and so.
[00:29:34] And you know, you can get to know somebody.
[00:29:36] I want to, I know that referral psychology.
[00:29:39] Let's talk about referral psychology because that is a big.
[00:29:42] Speaking about passions.
[00:29:44] Yeah, go ahead.
[00:29:46] Now I was going to say, tell me about.
[00:29:48] So yeah, no, no, no, I tell me all about it.
[00:29:51] What is referral psychology?
[00:29:52] Why, why should we care about it?
[00:29:54] Referral psychology.
[00:29:55] So I'm huge into referrals.
[00:29:58] Referrals for REALTORS is the best way to do business.
[00:30:02] Growing up, my dad, he was a public speaker and he spoke on every major stage in US and Canada for a company called by referral only.
[00:30:10] Have you ever heard of that one?
[00:30:12] So he was part of that with all these people, including one of them.
[00:30:18] His name is Dean Jackson, marketing genius.
[00:30:21] He's amazing.
[00:30:22] And so for B&I Tampa, our franchise at B&I here in Tampa Bay, we had Dean Jackson come out for an event we did for leadership summit, for leadership conference.
[00:30:32] Actually, it was March best ideas conference.
[00:30:34] Let me correct myself on that.
[00:30:36] And he's talking about referral psychology.
[00:30:39] And it really impacted me because it changed everything for me as far as how I see referrals.
[00:30:46] And he talks about how human nature, right, we want to refer everything to everybody.
[00:30:54] That's just what we want to do, human nature.
[00:30:56] But in a business when we're looking for referrals, we're like, oh, I don't want to use my friends and family.
[00:31:03] I don't want to like have them, you know, make them refer me.
[00:31:07] I don't want to, you know, push it on people where no, we don't have to push it on people.
[00:31:12] But you can't teach them how to refer you because everybody's looking to refer somebody.
[00:31:17] It's like, if I start talking to DJ and I start talking about, oh, this TV show is watching the day.
[00:31:21] I was talking, we're watching Ted Lasso and I was watching the scene of him throwing darts and it was amazing about staying curious
[00:31:28] and telling them how amazing his TV show is.
[00:31:30] I know in DJ's mind right now, he's thinking about, oh, what TV show did I watch last?
[00:31:35] Oh, TV show could I tell them about or if I start talking about my favorite books, DJ is going to start thinking, oh,
[00:31:41] I wonder if Cameron's read this book yet.
[00:31:42] And then he'll talk about it because we always want to refer.
[00:31:45] Oh my gosh, I had the most amazing stake at this place last night.
[00:31:49] Oh, dude, you've got to try this restaurant, right?
[00:31:51] We always want to refer each other.
[00:31:54] It's just how do we do it professionally?
[00:31:57] How do we teach others how to refer us?
[00:32:00] They just need the right tools because it's different back in ancient days, right?
[00:32:07] We'll call them ancient days.
[00:32:09] And I actually mean ancient.
[00:32:10] I'm not talking about like the 1990s.
[00:32:12] I'm talking about cave man days.
[00:32:14] This is how Dean Jackson describes it.
[00:32:16] I loved it.
[00:32:17] Pain in a beautiful picture in my mind.
[00:32:19] He said, if you were cave man Joe and cave man Joe goes out wandering,
[00:32:23] he finds just this amazing,
[00:32:25] with beautiful bushel of blueberries.
[00:32:27] And you're walking back to the cave and you see cave man Steve walking out of the cave.
[00:32:35] You're walking in and you're blueberries and you say, hey, cave man, Steve,
[00:32:40] if you go around the bend under the arch and turn to the right,
[00:32:44] you're going to find this bushel of blueberries.
[00:32:47] What happens in that circumstance is you elevated your status in the herd as Dean Jackson calls it.
[00:32:56] You elevate your status in your community because you could have had it.
[00:33:00] I mean, just say, oh, where'd you get those blueberries and you not tell them because you don't have to.
[00:33:04] But because you did that signals security in your position and you have an elevated status
[00:33:09] because you did something for somebody else that you didn't need to do.
[00:33:13] And so cave man Steve will now be looking for things in order to equalize his status or to elevate his own status
[00:33:22] because that's what we do.
[00:33:24] It's so much of what we do as humans is elevating our status,
[00:33:27] whether that be through relationships, whether that be through money, whether that be through career.
[00:33:32] If we want to elevate our status.
[00:33:34] And so next time you see a saber truth tiger,
[00:33:36] it'll be like, hey, cave man Joe, watch out, saber to tiger over there.
[00:33:39] And that's elevating his status.
[00:33:41] And that's kind of what a referral is is elevating our status.
[00:33:45] It's kind of like saying, I know something you didn't.
[00:33:49] I'm telling you because I'm cool.
[00:33:54] Kind of it's kind of like what it is.
[00:33:56] It's elevating your status.
[00:33:57] So with that, how do we teach others to do it?
[00:34:00] Knowing that we all want to do it fundamentally.
[00:34:06] Well, there's a bajillion ways to do it.
[00:34:08] Focusing on REALTORS.
[00:34:10] That's what we really want to do.
[00:34:12] I have a question first.
[00:34:14] How many times DJ you've been a REALTOR?
[00:34:16] You work on referrals from other REALTORS to grow your own brokerage?
[00:34:22] I assume.
[00:34:24] Well, I don't, but I work very similarly to what a REALTOR does.
[00:34:29] I actually recruit REALTORS, but it's the same process because I want our existing agents
[00:34:34] to refer other agents to us.
[00:34:37] And a REALTOR wants their existing clients to do that to refer other clients.
[00:34:42] So I have the same, I don't have a different job, but the same exact process.
[00:34:46] Same model ish.
[00:34:48] So with that, how many times have you heard right?
[00:34:51] You tell your client or you tell one of your REALTORS, hey, next time you meet somebody that x
[00:34:56] and x and x and x, I would love to meet them.
[00:35:03] And then you see him at the grocery store a couple weeks later and they come up to you.
[00:35:07] Hey DJ, you know, I was talking with my neighbor Stacy.
[00:35:10] Did she ever reach out to you?
[00:35:12] No, she hasn't.
[00:35:14] Oh, I'm sorry that didn't work out.
[00:35:18] Hey, I tell a lot of people about you.
[00:35:21] I talk about you all the time.
[00:35:23] And they grab their jam and they keep walking.
[00:35:25] All right, how many times do we hear that?
[00:35:27] We hear that all the time.
[00:35:30] I work on referral basis too.
[00:35:32] I hear this all the time and I teach people this in their communication and referrals.
[00:35:36] And so the biggest thing to close the gap is to have them introduce you personally,
[00:35:43] whether that be in person, whether that be a three way text,
[00:35:47] three way email, make the connection.
[00:35:50] You don't want them to just give a business card or say, hey, you should reach out to this person.
[00:35:55] Give them a reason to connect.
[00:35:58] And so there's a lot of different ways we can do this.
[00:36:01] But you want to paint the picture in people's minds of what a good referral for you looks like.
[00:36:08] You want to paint that avatar of, oh, families that just had a baby, they need a bigger house
[00:36:14] or newlyweds or kids going off to college or downsizing because their kids
[00:36:20] are going off to college or they're getting too old or going to retirement home.
[00:36:25] And painting the picture of this is who a good referral for me is,
[00:36:29] they need to know what a good referral is and they need to know how to connect you.
[00:36:33] That is how you be successful in referrals.
[00:36:37] Not just big, open, random things.
[00:36:40] You want to be hyper specific to be able to paint that picture, paint the Mona Lisa.
[00:36:48] So I think that's really important stuff.
[00:36:55] And when we're talking about painting that Mona Lisa, I think you get as granular as you can with it.
[00:37:04] It's, hey, if you ever run across somebody who mentions they're looking to move,
[00:37:10] do me a favor, shoot me an email, copy them on the email, and if you could make an introduction,
[00:37:16] I would be so eternally grateful.
[00:37:19] Versus, yeah, I passed my name along, pass,
[00:37:21] you know, give them the actual instruction.
[00:37:24] If they like, no like and trust you, they're going to want to do it anyway.
[00:37:29] So, you make them out to be the hero.
[00:37:33] Everybody wants to be a hero.
[00:37:35] That is fundamental in who we are.
[00:37:36] We all want to be hero.
[00:37:37] We grow up reading stories, watching movies about being the hero.
[00:37:41] So if you can have a way for them to give their friend value
[00:37:47] when referring you, it's even better, right?
[00:37:49] Great referrals, fantastic.
[00:37:51] But say you tell
[00:37:55] your person who's going to refer you.
[00:37:57] If you meet somebody who's planning on moving,
[00:38:00] right, this could look like people downsizing,
[00:38:02] like a new married couple, this could look like, give them a couple different options.
[00:38:07] Yeah, there's a couple things they need to do before they move so that they can get the best price
[00:38:12] for their home and it can be the smooth transition possible.
[00:38:16] I would love an email introduction to those people you meet
[00:38:20] because I can get them the basic steps of what they need to do to maximize
[00:38:25] as the opportunity for their house.
[00:38:28] Yeah, that's not true.
[00:38:29] So now when they're looking essentially,
[00:38:31] oh, before you sell your house, you need to meet my friend, VJ.
[00:38:34] He is going to tell you how to get the most out of it, right?
[00:38:38] Whether you have a checklist, whether you have whatever it is,
[00:38:40] but have a reason to introduce you rather than I want to sell their house, right?
[00:38:43] It's extra value on top of that.
[00:38:46] Just levels up those referrals.
[00:38:48] I love that. So the tip is to get hyper-specific
[00:38:53] with your referral sources. Let them know how
[00:38:58] the best way to refer business to you, those exact steps.
[00:39:02] And also, I always like to, I have a coach
[00:39:06] who at the end of every session, after he's done helping me,
[00:39:12] he is saying, how else can I help you today?
[00:39:16] And that's another thing that we can also say
[00:39:20] to those referral sources is a version of that, maybe that would look like,
[00:39:24] how can I help you with your business?
[00:39:26] Like, is there anyone you're looking for for your business or for whatever?
[00:39:31] And people love that.
[00:39:33] So this idea of the reciprocity piece is like,
[00:39:36] how do I also serve these referral sources?
[00:39:39] Even beyond, they already know like, and trust me.
[00:39:42] But how can I still add value to whatever they're doing?
[00:39:45] And most of the time people will just go,
[00:39:47] I'm talking about elevating.
[00:39:50] No, no, no.
[00:39:51] Obviously, most of the time people will just go, oh, I'm good, but thank you.
[00:39:54] But it's such a flattering thing to ask.
[00:39:57] And such a sign of caring about somebody.
[00:40:02] That it comes off incredibly well and it gets somebody to want to reciprocate.
[00:40:07] So go ahead, I'm sorry.
[00:40:10] I'm not a little bit.
[00:40:11] Hopefully it's reconnecting.
[00:40:12] Can you hear me okay?
[00:40:14] Oh, yeah, yeah, you're you were cutting out a bit, but I think we're good.
[00:40:18] Okay, I'm back.
[00:40:19] Yeah, I was going to say speaking of elevating your status in the herd and your community,
[00:40:24] if you're a REALTOR, this is one of those powerful things you can do
[00:40:29] to really elevate your status in whoever's eyes is asking them that question.
[00:40:36] You know, how can I help you?
[00:40:38] A lot inside of B&I for the REALTORS in different chapters.
[00:40:42] B&I is a networking group of chapters of professionals.
[00:40:46] And so we teach them this as a way to generate referrals for the four partners in their room.
[00:40:52] And this could be the people that are in your inner circle as a REALTOR,
[00:40:55] whether you're in a networking group or not.
[00:40:58] But how can I help you?
[00:41:01] And then find this, we really need our HFACTS to replace.
[00:41:04] Or my mom has been having struggles with her need.
[00:41:07] Oh, we should talk to my physical therapist.
[00:41:09] I'll get you set up.
[00:41:10] And finding the solutions, having that network of people around you,
[00:41:13] whether you're in a structured version of a group or whether that's just your inner circle,
[00:41:17] people you've developed, relationships.
[00:41:19] Because that way you're going to stay top of mind in both people's minds.
[00:41:23] And you're the hero to both of them because you're doing it.
[00:41:26] And that's not really communication, but I count that as communication because
[00:41:30] or phrase or communication.
[00:41:34] Absolutely.
[00:41:35] I love it.
[00:41:35] Let's dive into some communication tips.
[00:41:39] So tell us what are some do's and don'ts
[00:41:43] in the when you're wanting to be intentional about your communication.
[00:41:50] Absolutely.
[00:41:52] So being intentional about communication is the top, right?
[00:41:56] That is number one.
[00:41:57] So I've got three tips you're that are prepared specifically for REALTORS that it's
[00:42:02] going to incredibly powerful for everything you're doing.
[00:42:05] The first one is this this tip.
[00:42:09] It really comes from Chris Both.
[00:42:11] He is a hostage negotiator for the FBI.
[00:42:14] He's the founder of the Black Swan Group.
[00:42:16] He's a negotiation master.
[00:42:19] And he talks about this concept called mirror and labeling.
[00:42:23] Mirroring is when you're
[00:42:28] somebody and you repeat what they said, right?
[00:42:31] It's kind of like that.
[00:42:33] Like if DJ tells me, oh yeah, last week I went on a vacation to Cancun.
[00:42:37] I go vacation to Cancun.
[00:42:40] That's all I have to say.
[00:42:41] That's a mirror.
[00:42:41] And then he'd tell me, yeah, we went on the flow rider and we got the most amazing
[00:42:46] sushi at this restaurant.
[00:42:48] I'm like sushi.
[00:42:49] I don't have to say anything else.
[00:42:50] It's just sushi.
[00:42:52] You think, oh my goodness, the sushi was amazing.
[00:42:53] There was mango on it and this thing and this is it was fantastic.
[00:42:58] Then comes in the part of the labeling.
[00:43:01] Right?
[00:43:01] Mirroring is just staying the words.
[00:43:04] The most interesting, passionate word.
[00:43:06] And then the labeling is, so it sounds like you had a really good time in Cancun.
[00:43:11] Labeling the key to a good label is it always starts with.
[00:43:14] It sounds like it looks like or it seems like.
[00:43:19] You can have an entire deep level conversation
[00:43:24] with you just mirroring and labeling.
[00:43:26] The other person doesn't even realize it.
[00:43:28] And then like, oh my gosh, the best
[00:43:30] conversationalists in the world.
[00:43:31] They care about what I have to say just by labeling and mirroring.
[00:43:35] So a
[00:43:36] a
[00:43:36] because
[00:43:37] right, we want to talk about what we want to talk about.
[00:43:39] 
[00:43:39] absolutely.
[00:43:40] And a practical way to do this for agents is as you're talking to your client
[00:43:46] and you're getting the sense of what they want in their transaction.
[00:43:50] So you're looking to buy a home.
[00:43:52] Great.
[00:43:52] Tell me about exactly what you want.
[00:43:54] And you know, you start writing down for bedrooms, for bath, whatever.
[00:43:59] You know, whatever all of the the once the musts are.
[00:44:02] And then it sounds like to make sure just to make sure I have this correct.
[00:44:06] It sounds like you're looking for bang, bang, bang, bang, bang.
[00:44:09] And what's funny about that is you are just repeating back what they said.
[00:44:14] But to them, it is like you are speaking this magical language that is exactly
[00:44:21] in the way they categorize it in their brain.
[00:44:24] Because you are literally just repeating back what they say.
[00:44:27] And also it's a good idea to do just so that you are making sure you're
[00:44:32] calibrating to make sure that you are listening and understanding.
[00:44:36] But it is it is the funniest thing because you're absolutely right.
[00:44:39] People will react to it as if you've been there.
[00:44:44] Like you you have a key to their like the deepest thoughts.
[00:44:46] Like wow, this guy gets me.
[00:44:50] So tell us.
[00:44:51] Yeah, so give us some other tips.
[00:44:53] What else?
[00:44:54] Another tip.
[00:44:56] Let's go with a micro story.
[00:44:57] Micro stories are so powerful.
[00:44:59] And this is instead of saying, oh, this dining room is so big.
[00:45:04] It's so spacious.
[00:45:05] A micro story.
[00:45:08] Super simple could be, you know, this is the type of dining room.
[00:45:12] You could have a Thanksgiving dinner with 12 people.
[00:45:14] Or this living room is so cozy.
[00:45:18] This is the kind of living room.
[00:45:19] We're on a Sunday afternoon.
[00:45:20] You're just sitting here with your spouse watching the football game.
[00:45:24] Right.
[00:45:25] Those little micro stories that paints a picture in people's minds,
[00:45:27] especially as a REALTOR can be incredibly powerful.
[00:45:31] But then again, you can apply this to many other things.
[00:45:34] But REALTOR focused, you sit when describing the house,
[00:45:37] describing the room, describing what type of vibe they're going to.
[00:45:41] Now again, this needs authenticity because you need to first connect with that person.
[00:45:45] No really what they're because if you're talking about,
[00:45:48] oh, this is where you sit Sunday nights and in watch football.
[00:45:52] If you're not the type of person that watches sports,
[00:45:55] you're like, oh, cool.
[00:45:58] When it ends on deaf ears, I don't care.
[00:46:00] Right.
[00:46:01] So
[00:46:03] using those micro stories.
[00:46:07] Yeah.
[00:46:08] And in what agents can do, what do you think in order to make sure they're
[00:46:12] populated?
[00:46:13] I get a time.
[00:46:13] Mike.
[00:46:15] Oh, sorry.
[00:46:16] I think we're we're a little out of sync.
[00:46:17] Apologize for that.
[00:46:22] I'm sorry.
[00:46:23] Just cut out a little bit more.
[00:46:24] It's aggravating.
[00:46:24] But I was going to stay.
[00:46:26] Yeah, no, that's okay.
[00:46:29] So what what I was what I was saying was that,
[00:46:33] you know, in order to know exactly what those micro stories could entail,
[00:46:38] that would be a great thing to ask a client.
[00:46:42] Hey, in your living room, how do you and your spouse anticipate using it?
[00:46:47] Like what are the activities you do in here?
[00:46:49] And then you could create a micro story around that the next time it comes around.
[00:46:54] Because you're right.
[00:46:55] Like I don't watch a lot of sporting events.
[00:46:58] So, you know, for my television, that's not a big thing for me.
[00:47:01] But I do enjoy watching other types of movies and shows.
[00:47:05] Or, you know, doing other things in that same room.
[00:47:07] So you're right.
[00:47:08] Is first big calibrating, finding out what the person's into.
[00:47:13] And then using that to, you know, sort of bring to life some of these, you know, these in this case rooms.
[00:47:25] Absolutely.
[00:47:26] And let's close it out with my third tip for REALTORS inside of communication, which is
[00:47:32] delivering certainty and conviction.
[00:47:35] This is huge.
[00:47:36] This is massively important with REALTORS because you are a rock in an uncertain time for so many people.
[00:47:42] 
[00:47:43] Moving is stressful.
[00:47:45] Negotiating a deal is emotional.
[00:47:47] And so a lot of times people need a rock, just solid, certain person.
[00:47:51] We're like, oh, yeah, absolutely done.
[00:47:53] And if you don't know something, it's not a, oh, I don't know.
[00:47:56] It's, I'm going to find that out.
[00:47:57] I'm going to get that to you by three o'clock.
[00:47:59] Or I'm going to get that to you by tomorrow morning.
[00:48:01] And then follow through with that, but being certain and having conviction
[00:48:05] as a REALTOR inside of your communication is so important.
[00:48:10] And there's a way you know you don't have certainty when you're communicating, which is
[00:48:14] the intonations of your voice.
[00:48:16] If you're ending a sentence or a word on an uptick like this,
[00:48:20] it means you don't really know what you're saying.
[00:48:24] And you're not really hurting a thing.
[00:48:26] Is anything questioning everything?
[00:48:29] And don't sound, you don't sound like you're solid doing like you are the rock,
[00:48:33] but you can depend on in this emotional stressful time.
[00:48:36] So keeping your intonations either flat or at a downward curve.
[00:48:41] If you're visualizing that, that really communicates that certainty
[00:48:46] that a lot of home buyers need.
[00:48:51] Yeah, that's a, that is a great, great tip.
[00:48:54] The, there are a lot of people who don't even realize that at the end of their statements,
[00:49:00] they inflect up.
[00:49:02] And it's not because they are uncertain.
[00:49:04] It's just how it, it just sounds uncertain whether they're uncertain or not.
[00:49:08] And so you're right.
[00:49:09] It throws you a little bit as the other person, you're like,
[00:49:13] does this person, it's confusing.
[00:49:16] So I am 100% in agreement.
[00:49:18] That is something.
[00:49:19] And also before we, before we get off of this, you have a very pleasant
[00:49:24] tonality.
[00:49:25] Tonality is something that doesn't really get talked about at the very beginning,
[00:49:29] we mentioned it.
[00:49:30] It is something that you can practice.
[00:49:32] You can learn how to have better tonality.
[00:49:36] You can learn how to change the sound of your voice.
[00:49:41] It's, it's not an inauthentic thing.
[00:49:43] It's a skill.
[00:49:44] And if people spend just a little bit of time studying this and they can study it with you,
[00:49:51] they will find that people will respond to them totally differently
[00:49:55] than what they were in the past.
[00:49:59] Absolutely.
[00:50:02] Tell us aboutarticulateadvantaged.com.
[00:50:11] Articulateadvantaged.com
[00:50:15] But I do one-on-one code virtually and in person,
[00:50:18] well as keynotes and trainings virtually and in person.
[00:50:22] But I did want to talk to one last thing,
[00:50:23] you're talking about the tonality and changing your voice.
[00:50:27] So many people think it's inauthentic as you're saying to change your voice,
[00:50:31] because there's a handful of things that as humans,
[00:50:34] we associate our personality with.
[00:50:38] And it is incredibly authentic to change your voice,
[00:50:41] because you are who you've trained yourself to be.
[00:50:43] You talk the way you do it,
[00:50:46] just because that's the way you've always talked and you can change it.
[00:50:50] I could talk with just a random accent.
[00:50:52] I could start talking like this the entire time.
[00:50:54] It's not a British accent.
[00:50:55] It's just a random, I have no clue what this access to forever.
[00:50:58] And it would be me and I could choose to do this or I could speak in Spanish.
[00:51:02] And I could never speak English again.
[00:51:05] And that would be me.
[00:51:06] People never say, oh my gosh, DJ, you learned how to play the guitar.
[00:51:13] That's not you.
[00:51:14] Why are you trying to be somebody you're not?
[00:51:17] Why are you trying to change who you are?
[00:51:20] But when we do it with our voices,
[00:51:22] when we want to have maybe a lower voice or a more resonant voice,
[00:51:25] or we want to have more emotion and more excitement,
[00:51:28] or if we just cut out those upper intonations and we change,
[00:51:31] or we messed with the dynamics of our voice,
[00:51:33] some people be like, hey, that's not you.
[00:51:37] But it is you because you're deciding to do it.
[00:51:40] So that's something really fun.
[00:51:42] Yeah, actually.
[00:51:46] And these are things that it's my man world.
[00:51:51] I love it.
[00:51:52] And for those listening, sorry, we are a little bit out of sync with our
[00:51:56] communication.
[00:51:57] It's just an internet issue.
[00:51:59] But Cameron, Cameron is an amazing communicator.

[00:52:31] It's a skill.
[00:52:32] There's always another level.
[00:52:34] And the better your communication as Cameron said at the beginning,
[00:52:37] the better your connection is with other human beings.
[00:52:42] And we know that connection leads to happiness.

Now, as a real estate recruiter, I can tell you the answer is always yes. But most agents aren't looking to move right now. So how do you know who to contact? Well, what if I were to tell you there's a recruiting and retention tool powered by artificial intelligence that shows you exactly which agents in your local market are looking to leave their brokerage right now and which agents at your own firm are also looking to leave you? Now, I've been recruiting REALTORS for 15 years and I've hired over 2,000 agents. I can tell you with no exaggeration, this is the tool I've been waiting for. Corded's AI looks for trends across dozens of variables for each agent in your market and shows you which agents they believe are likely to move. Not only does it do that, but Corded's AI went and visited my recruiting website and read everything I offer. So now when I'm recruiting, Corded's AI tells me exactly what to say based on that agent's needs and what my brokerage can offer. It even writes emails for me.

Let us know what you think of the show helps us out a lot. And again, please continue to tell all the agents in your office about this great podcast. Oh, one last thing. Cameron and I had a slight communication error ourselves. This was just a technology thing. So you'll hear there's a little bit of a delay towards the end of the podcast where he and I aren't totally in sync. I apologize for that. No unfortunate fix, but you'll still be able to get unbelievable value and I can't wait for you to listen. So let's just jump right to it. My conversation with Cameron Reynolds. What is the best piece of advice you ever have heard or anyone gave you around communication? The best piece, one of my big mentors, not a real mentor, more like a fake mentor. I learn a lot from him. Is Vin John. He's the agent who is all over social media with communication, he's the magician. And he always talks about frames. And then I found this is very common in a lot of communication. When I was really getting into it, the beginning, it was all about the frames and how to structure your ideas so they come out better. They come out more clear. They come out easier to understand rather than that garbled mess that you have in your head. So that's probably the best. I love that. And what is one mistake that drives you nuts that people or what's the number one mistake people make around communication? The number one mistake that's killing your effectiveness inside of communication. The best way to describe this is one of my college professors. Amazing, women super intelligent, very good teacher. New issue is talking about, but the way she talked, just put everybody to sleep, and what I mean by that is she would use the same exact tone and rhythm and pace and it would sound, nobody could pay attention. To give you an example, she would always be talking like this and she wouldn't stop and it was the exact same for 45 minutes and it never stopped doing anything. But this and it was horrible, the vocal dynamics. I just fell asleep by my second. I completely fell asleep. You lose everybody. You could be talking about absolutely nothing, but if it sounds interesting, you can keep people on. It doesn't, and it doesn't matter what you're talking about. You know, it does a perfect job of what you're talking about is NPR radio. NPR radio is funny because they use a very slow and calm mentality. They could say like today a fire took out an entire village, 300 people were dead, and you're like, oh, that sounds great. And then you're like, wait a minute, what? Yeah. So I totally understand. All right, Cameron Reynolds, he is our guest today. He is a communication coach, keynote speaker, and the founder of Articulate Advantage, which is a coaching firm helping professionals master their voice and turn conversations into opportunities. Before I tell you a little bit more about Cameron, I want to make a big play for this. If you, it really whatever profession you're in, if you're listening to this, you're almost assuredly a REALTOR, I promise you that this is so important and it's so much beyond what you say. We're going to talk a lot about how you say things. We just discussed a little bit of that with tonality. And we're going to talk about frames, as Cameron mentioned. I promise you, this is so important and it's something that never gets talked about. But more about Cameron, he is a lifelong student of human connection. Cameron combines the science of influence with the art of authenticity to help business owners build trust, earn referrals, and grow with intention. He's trained entrepreneurs, sales teams, and service professionals all across the country with a focus on practical storytelling, confident delivery, and referral-based growth. While he's not coaching or speaking, when he's not coaching or speaking, Cameron serves as an executive director for BNI, which many of you listening are probably members of, where he helps chapters grow through stronger presentations and strategic relationships. His unique perspective and energy have earned him stages at national conferences and today he's here to share the frameworks and mindset shifts that make referrals a natural outcome of genuine connection. I believe fully that the real estate business is a relationship business and referrals come from the deepest of those relationships. I want, we're going to talk about that today. I want everybody to visit Cameron's website at ArticulateAdvantaged.com. Again, ArticulateAdvantaged.com will have a link to that in the show notes and follow him on social. That is Cameron underscore Ray. That's K-A-M-R-Y and underscore R-E-Y. We'll have a link to all of his social and his social accounts as well as his website. Cameron, welcome. Thank you. I feel welcome. Thank you. I will tell you as a sort of thing to the audience that I use my voice sometimes to make myself sound more interesting than I really am and a little bit of enthusiasm or excitement really does have a tremendous impact well beyond the words I'm saying. I am so excited to talk to you about this today. Before we get into sort of the practical ways of utilizing communication strategy, I want to learn about your story. How did you get into this? That's a great question. There's the more purposeful why and then there's the series of events why. But the more purposeful why is growing up, I was never the most athletic. I was never the smartest, never the best looking and so I had to be able to talk and it certainly really well throughout high school, getting on to tick-tock, doing random things with my friends, whatever I thought was funny at the time and getting hundreds of thousands of followers. But as soon as I graduated high school, I turned 18 and I decided to drop everything I've ever known and serve a mission trip in Argentina for a couple of years and going from my number one thing is to be able to communicate and talk to people to living in a country in this small town of a couple thousand people with dirt streets and it's called the windy city of Argentina. It's called Zapala, it's the name of the town where I couldn't communicate with anybody. I couldn't connect with anybody because I didn't know the language and I didn't know the culture and that was huge and before that point, I never knew what depression was like because all it was to me was when a girl in high school, the guy they like didn't like them back and they're like, oh my gosh, I'm depressed and I'm like, oh my goodness, get over yourself. The sun is in the sky. There's food on your table, there's roof over your head, life is good, depression is fake. But when I felt completely alone in a country, on this other side of the world, I really got to understand what that felt like, to really be depressed to have no connection with anybody for months until I finally was able to learn how to speak, getting the culture because I'd be in rooms full of people, but the worst part is I'd feel completely alone until I relearned how to communicate from the ground up in a different language with different culture, different hand movements, different face movements. So that gave me a deeper appreciation for it. When I got back, being inside of B&I, presenting, speaking, I was like, man, yeah, this is great. And then I realized, not everybody is great at this. And I see so many people who I can just tell they felt like I did back when I lived in Argentina where they would feel completely alone, even though they're surrounded with people. So that's really why I do what I do is to help people connect because connection, man, if you don't have connection, life's hard. Yeah, and with connection, life is worth living, I think. There's where we're wired for connection. The data is pretty clear on that. We're not meant to be alone. And in order to, I think about this a lot with, I'll give you an example, a personal example with my girlfriend. So we're in the stages of going to figuring out the rest of our lives. And we've worked on our communication specifically around conflict because conflict is the hardest part of any relationship and it's inevitable. It's just part of the deal. And everyone's got different rules, but also everyone's got different communication styles and strategies. And some people when they get into conflict, they withdraw and that's what they need. And they need to go away and kind of process. Other people want to confront and have a more spirited conversation or try to work it out in the moment. Right? These are all different ways of getting to the same end, which is some sort of resolution. And we work on this because of course we're two different human beings from different backgrounds, different communication styles in our families growing up. And now it's like, hey, we better figure this out because, and we need to practice it so that when we do get into conflict and we do, of course, everyone does, we have a process for reconnection. And that a lot of it has to do with how, oftentimes it's not about what we're arguing. Like what we're arguing is fairly trivial. It's just, you know, whatever it's an argument about something usually not that important. But we can get very heated and very upset about it. And that doesn't really serve us. So we have processes that we've studied about how to exactly do this. So I use it practically in my home life, but I also see so much potential to use it in business world as well or just to deepen friendships even. You know, so I'm such a fan of this. Let's dive in. So let's double down on that, the connection piece because it's so important and everything we do. Have you ever heard of the rat park? No. There was this whole research study into rat park. So as this research study, originally to define and really understand addiction and what they did is they took a rat and they got a cage and they put the rat in the cage with two different water bottles. One was just normal water and one was water laced with either heroin or crack depending on the day. And this rat every single time would go to the drug water and would overdose every time. And so scientists and the people who studied this, they drew a lot of conclusions from that. And they said, if the chemical hooks are strong enough, we will get hooked. We will eventually overdose. It overpowers us. And that's a lot of what we understand about addiction today. But then there was this other researcher who looked at that and he said, yeah, but let's try a couple other things. And so eventually he made this cage and he called it rat park. And this cage was filled with colorful balls and tunnels and toys. But most importantly, there was other rats. And so when they put the rat in, the test rat, they again had the two water bottles. They had the water and they had the drug water. And what they found was crazy. What they found was that 0% of the time that a single rat overdose, not once that it happened. And even crazier is none of the rats even liked the drug water. None of them went back to it having that community. The reality was better. He drew the conclusion. The reality was better than escape. Yeah. Of course. And so he drew the conclusion from this of what if the chemical hook isn't the thing that gets us, what if it's a lack of connection that leads to addiction? Because there's lots of different things that we get addicted to, whether it's our phones or drugs or food or sugar. And so it's that connection that is fundamental to so many things we do as humans. And that's just the exacerbated example of it. And in order. I just wanted to get that in there because I think it's fascinating. And in order to have connection, you need to be an effective communicator. You just do. And it's something that very few people study. It's a lot easier. Yeah, very few people study at all. And it's something that can, there are small tweaks that people can make. And you know these because you teach them about how to be more effective, how to connect with others more effortlessly. And just, you know, so let's dive into it. So let's, let's, where do you want to start? Oh, let's start with, you know, building on connection, how to connect better authenticity. I know this is huge for you. I was looking at your LinkedIn profile, prepping for this podcast. And I know that on yours, you said you have a line about authenticity. Do you remember what it is? Oh my goodness. I got to, I'm going to something about trying to be authentic. I don't know, hopefully. Oh, it's something amazing. Let me see. Oh, wow, I appreciate you flattery. It'll get you. It'll get you pretty far. Not going to lie. But it was talking about like authenticity, authenticity is your superpower or something like that or something, right? The importance of authenticity. And the biggest thing about it is authenticity can't be faked. It's kind of in the definition of authenticity. As humans, we just understand when somebody's being authentic or when they're not. It's just that gut feeling. And if they're not authentic, you just don't connect because you always have that feeling of, what are they hiding? Are they keeping something back, right? You just feel the lack of authenticity. So building that in, man, if you don't have that, that's that's step one. That is step one is having an authentic personality, one, but then having an authentic why? Because this podcast, primarily, primarily I should say, is for REALTORS. And so as a REALTOR, if you're just doing it, you know, because you want to sell houses, you want to make money, you want to dictate your own schedule, how you do things when you do things where you do them, you could have success. But it's the REALTORS that connect with their clients who have an authentic purpose and they express that and everything they do. Those are the REALTORS that have clients for generations who sell the second, third home, they sell the kids home, they buy the condo off at college. Those, that's the real difference between just the REALTOR that sold me my house a couple years ago and the family friend who is one of us is that authentic connection. Yeah, I agree. It's, you're absolutely right. And you see this a lot in social media with for REALTORS where there's some agents that will post really just their, their wins, which would be just sold this home, just listed a property, whatever. And those are fine, you know, I guess it's nice to celebrate your, your, your wins. But the agents that talk more authentically about their lives and talk about maybe even their struggles or certainly the things that are passionate to them, maybe around real estate or maybe in their personal life, those agents, we know we, we want to connect with, with someone's authenticity because I think the reason is, is because there's an honesty to it that we trust. So once we believe somebody's authentic, we don't have to worry about whether they're a trustworthy person or not. I think there's an inherent level of trust that's just kind of associated with that. So there's, there's something to be, yeah, I think there's something to be said about figuring out how to project authenticity because you might be an authentic person, but your communication skills might not be up to par and that authenticity might not be coming through even though you are an ethical honest, good human being. So I want to talk also about, you know, what are some ways that people could increase the, the way they project authenticity? Is there any suggestions you have? Absolutely. There's a lot of body language tricks to that. It's like everything right there is tricks, but it has to come from the right place. It's like same thing, we're going to talk about authenticity, but same thing when it comes to however good you are at your job, however intelligent, however smart you are, people perceive you at the level of your communication, not at the level of your capability. Which is called, let's save that again, save that again, repeat that. People perceive you at the level of your communication, not at the level of your capability. For good or for bad, it's true. And so this is the same in authenticity. People are only as authentic as they communicate themselves. Now this isn't just words. This is also body language, this is an action. Everything you do is how you present yourself as how you communicate. So you always hear one of the biggest tips and tricks for that is being open, open body language, not being close to off, not folding your arms always, but being open, taking up space, being comfortable because then we're comfortable you are. A lot of times it means you don't have anything to hide. You're open, you're comfortable, you feel safe. So it's easier for the rest of the things to happen to be authentic. Another one is infuse emotion into what you're doing because you have these people where they always just want to talk about the facts and the dates and how things happen and what happened versus putting emotion into it. Right, these are the people of when you say, oh, how you doing? They say good. There's no authentic. There's nothing authentic about it. By the way, good is it really. Yeah, good doesn't tell me much. Good tells me nothing bad is happening, but it doesn't tell me how you're really doing. Right. And it might mean nothing bad is happening or just might mean they don't want to talk about it, right? Zero authenticity inside of good. Yeah. And so that give good answers. I'll tell you one little tip that I learned many years ago was because I'm quick to talk and interrupt and that's not great communication skills, but I have that sort of mind that just kind of does that. And so I have to purposefully pause when someone asks me a question and really reflect before I answer. And that also demonstrates authenticity because it's like, hmm, that's a great question. Let me think about it. Let me pause. It's respectful and it's flattering in a sense to the other person who asked it because you're taking it in, you're thinking about it, you're reflecting and then you're responding. And that is something I Yeah. Absolutely. And what it shows them and I can see that you're this type of person is you care what they're talking about. You're not just giving some answer to get to the next thing. You actually care what they're saying. You care about how you respond. And that is something very, very powerful for authenticity. And that's why you can see that DJ, you are an authentic person. And so that's why I think it really comes from you in that way. Yeah, thank you. I very much appreciate that. I have always found that there's an opportunity anytime we meet another human being. Everyone's passionate about something like it could be a hobby. It could be their personal life. It could be it whatever. Just they're into some underwater basket. We even know it could be. And and if someone's into that, I know I'm like, how did you get into that? Why did you get into that? Tell me what that does for you because I don't understand that at all. And I want to understand. I, but I love seeing whatever it is with somebody them light up. And people light up around at least one thing in their life. And very few people will ask them about that thing if it's like not known if they don't, you know. And so I always think conversations. Best conversations. Yeah. And so I just try to get curious. So I love, I think this is a great tip for anyone that if you're worried about what to, you know, how to communicate with somebody, get interested in what they're interested in. Find out what lights them up. That goes a long way into creating connection. Oh, so it's so huge. That just reminded me of this time. A couple months ago, I was on a plane ride between speaking events. And I sat down and normally just get on a plane ride and go to sleep or a watch a movie down, though, on my iPad. But this time I was sitting down in an exit row. And it was one of those where one of the crew, their seat was facing towards you backwards. I don't know if you've ever seen that. I was like, oh sure. And so I'm like, I could have some fun with this. And I sat there and we started to take off in this fight attendant. She sat down in front of me and I took my headphones off and I said, Hey, I'm Cameron. What's your name? Right. People over complicate introductions. Totally. Life is so simple when you treat it like you're all in preschool again. Hi, I'm Cameron. What's your name? She told me her name and all these things. And I said, so what made you want to be a flight attendant? Yep. And then she tells me all about it. And then she goes into a couple of questions later. She goes into her divorce and her kids and how her love is her dogs. And this trip she's going on in Italy, she's biking down the Italian coast and all of these things that she's super passionate because it wasn't like, Hey, you know, good flight. Wow. Yeah, super. How are you doing? Good. Oh, the weather's amazing. Right. Not to bash on small talk. A small talk definitely has its place. But when you can get to something somebody's passionate about, those are the fun conversations. But the small talk, I will say, small talk connects all of us, no matter who we are. Because we all love sunny days. We all love good food. We all hate traffic. And so it connects us on a small level. But it's the real conversations of finding emotion and passion that that's what deeply connects us. But it can also divide us more. If you've ever had that tabletop dinner of talking about politics or really with somebody who doesn't agree with you, right? For somebody, it could be the biggest connection you have for others that could be very dividing. So small talk connects us all, but it's that deep talk, that passionate conversation that connects us deeper. But only to someone. You know, but but you're so right. And the flight attendant and now stories are good one because you know flight attend flight attendants are often treated as you know workers or treated as problem solvers or I have a question. They're not necessarily treated as actual human beings in a sense of like I want to get to know you. And you know, they've got a job to do and they, you know, unless you're sitting across from them, you probably don't have a ton of opportunity to do what you did. But I'll bet you you're the only person that day that asked her, how'd you get into this? Like tell me about it. Like what do you like about it? You kept giving me free snacks and she wanted to give me like all these things that you had to pay for. She's like, Hey, do you want this? Do you want it? I'm like, no, okay. And after I got off, she's like, bye. And I'm like, bye. So it's just fun. People want to be connected with. You just have to do it in a way that's not creepy stalker vibes. And I always say you don't have to worry about looking like a creepy stalker if you're not a creepy stalker. Right? The only people that really need to worry about that are people that, you know, if you aren't that person, don't worry about it. Like the feedback will tell you. You will find out. And, but, you know, it's, it is a thing that we are so not just divided because of our beliefs, but we are so removed because of technology that this idea of communication and connection is really more challenging, I think, because people aren't going up like you and speaking to the flight attendant across the way. They're like, Hey, I'm, I'm Cameron. Who are you? You know, like they don't, nobody does that. Yeah. And they, because they're busy, they're on their phones, they're whatever, they're sleeping. They're, and that's kind of how we move through life. And people are so starved for that kind of connection that it's not hard to do. As you said, hi, I'm Cameron. What's your name? Like it's literally that simple. And it will almost always result in a smile. Somebody's, you know, happy to, to meet you. You know, you have to pick your spots. Of course, it's like, you know, if you're a guy, don't do it to a woman while she's working out of the gym. Nobody wants that. She doesn't want that. But anywhere else you can do that. And say hi, I'm so and so. And you know, you can get to know somebody. I want to, I know that referral psychology. Let's talk about referral psychology because that is a big. Speaking about passions. Yeah, go ahead. Now I was going to say, tell me about. So yeah, no, no, no, I tell me all about it. What is referral psychology? Why, why should we care about it? Referral psychology. So I'm huge into referrals. Referrals for REALTORS is the best way to do business. Growing up, my dad, he was a public speaker and he spoke on every major stage in US and Canada for a company called by referral only. Have you ever heard of that one? So he was part of that with all these people, including one of them. His name is Dean Jackson, marketing genius. He's amazing. And so for B&I Tampa, our franchise at B&I here in Tampa Bay, we had Dean Jackson come out for an event we did for leadership summit, for leadership conference. Actually, it was March best ideas conference. Let me correct myself on that. And he's talking about referral psychology. And it really impacted me because it changed everything for me as far as how I see referrals. And he talks about how human nature, right, we want to refer everything to everybody. That's just what we want to do, human nature. But in a business when we're looking for referrals, we're like, oh, I don't want to use my friends and family. I don't want to like have them, you know, make them refer me. I don't want to, you know, push it on people where no, we don't have to push it on people. But you can't teach them how to refer you because everybody's looking to refer somebody. It's like, if I start talking to DJ and I start talking about, oh, this TV show is watching the day. I was talking, we're watching Ted Lasso and I was watching the scene of him throwing darts and it was amazing about staying curious and telling them how amazing his TV show is. I know in DJ's mind right now, he's thinking about, oh, what TV show did I watch last? Oh, TV show could I tell them about or if I start talking about my favorite books, DJ is going to start thinking, oh, I wonder if Cameron's read this book yet. And then he'll talk about it because we always want to refer. Oh my gosh, I had the most amazing stake at this place last night. Oh, dude, you've got to try this restaurant, right? We always want to refer each other. It's just how do we do it professionally? How do we teach others how to refer us? They just need the right tools because it's different back in ancient days, right? We'll call them ancient days. And I actually mean ancient. I'm not talking about like the 1990s. I'm talking about cave man days. This is how Dean Jackson describes it. I loved it. Pain in a beautiful picture in my mind. He said, if you were cave man Joe and cave man Joe goes out wandering, he finds just this amazing, with beautiful bushel of blueberries. And you're walking back to the cave and you see cave man Steve walking out of the cave. You're walking in and you're blueberries and you say, hey, cave man, Steve, if you go around the bend under the arch and turn to the right, you're going to find this bushel of blueberries. What happens in that circumstance is you elevated your status in the herd as Dean Jackson calls it. You elevate your status in your community because you could have had it. I mean, just say, oh, where'd you get those blueberries and you not tell them because you don't have to. But because you did that signals security in your position and you have an elevated status because you did something for somebody else that you didn't need to do. And so cave man Steve will now be looking for things in order to equalize his status or to elevate his own status because that's what we do. It's so much of what we do as humans is elevating our status, whether that be through relationships, whether that be through money, whether that be through career. If we want to elevate our status. And so next time you see a saber truth tiger, it'll be like, hey, cave man Joe, watch out, saber to tiger over there. And that's elevating his status. And that's kind of what a referral is is elevating our status. It's kind of like saying, I know something you didn't. I'm telling you because I'm cool. Kind of it's kind of like what it is. It's elevating your status. So with that, how do we teach others to do it? Knowing that we all want to do it fundamentally. Well, there's a bajillion ways to do it. Focusing on REALTORS. That's what we really want to do. I have a question first. How many times DJ you've been a REALTOR? You work on referrals from other REALTORS to grow your own brokerage? I assume. Well, I don't, but I work very similarly to what a REALTOR does. I actually recruit REALTORS, but it's the same process because I want our existing agents to refer other agents to us. And a REALTOR wants their existing clients to do that to refer other clients. So I have the same, I don't have a different job, but the same exact process. Same model ish. So with that, how many times have you heard right? You tell your client or you tell one of your REALTORS, hey, next time you meet somebody that x and x and x and x, I would love to meet them. And then you see him at the grocery store a couple weeks later and they come up to you. Hey DJ, you know, I was talking with my neighbor Stacy. Did she ever reach out to you? No, she hasn't. Oh, I'm sorry that didn't work out. Hey, I tell a lot of people about you. I talk about you all the time. And they grab their jam and they keep walking. All right, how many times do we hear that? We hear that all the time. I work on referral basis too. I hear this all the time and I teach people this in their communication and referrals. And so the biggest thing to close the gap is to have them introduce you personally, whether that be in person, whether that be a three way text, three way email, make the connection. You don't want them to just give a business card or say, hey, you should reach out to this person. Give them a reason to connect. And so there's a lot of different ways we can do this. But you want to paint the picture in people's minds of what a good referral for you looks like. You want to paint that avatar of, oh, families that just had a baby, they need a bigger house or newlyweds or kids going off to college or downsizing because their kids are going off to college or they're getting too old or going to retirement home. And painting the picture of this is who a good referral for me is, they need to know what a good referral is and they need to know how to connect you. That is how you be successful in referrals. Not just big, open, random things. You want to be hyper specific to be able to paint that picture, paint the Mona Lisa. So I think that's really important stuff. And when we're talking about painting that Mona Lisa, I think you get as granular as you can with it. It's, hey, if you ever run across somebody who mentions they're looking to move, do me a favor, shoot me an email, copy them on the email, and if you could make an introduction, I would be so eternally grateful. Versus, yeah, I passed my name along, pass, you know, give them the actual instruction. If they like, no like and trust you, they're going to want to do it anyway. So, you make them out to be the hero. Everybody wants to be a hero. That is fundamental in who we are. We all want to be hero. We grow up reading stories, watching movies about being the hero. So if you can have a way for them to give their friend value when referring you, it's even better, right? Great referrals, fantastic. But say you tell your person who's going to refer you. If you meet somebody who's planning on moving, right, this could look like people downsizing, like a new married couple, this could look like, give them a couple different options. Yeah, there's a couple things they need to do before they move so that they can get the best price for their home and it can be the smooth transition possible. I would love an email introduction to those people you meet because I can get them the basic steps of what they need to do to maximize as the opportunity for their house. Yeah, that's not true. So now when they're looking essentially, oh, before you sell your house, you need to meet my friend, VJ. He is going to tell you how to get the most out of it, right? Whether you have a checklist, whether you have whatever it is, but have a reason to introduce you rather than I want to sell their house, right? It's extra value on top of that. Just levels up those referrals. I love that. So the tip is to get hyper-specific with your referral sources. Let them know how the best way to refer business to you, those exact steps. And also, I always like to, I have a coach who at the end of every session, after he's done helping me, he is saying, how else can I help you today? And that's another thing that we can also say to those referral sources is a version of that, maybe that would look like, how can I help you with your business? Like, is there anyone you're looking for for your business or for whatever? And people love that. So this idea of the reciprocity piece is like, how do I also serve these referral sources? Even beyond, they already know like, and trust me. But how can I still add value to whatever they're doing? And most of the time people will just go, I'm talking about elevating. No, no, no. Obviously, most of the time people will just go, oh, I'm good, but thank you. But it's such a flattering thing to ask. And such a sign of caring about somebody. That it comes off incredibly well and it gets somebody to want to reciprocate. So go ahead, I'm sorry. I'm not a little bit. Hopefully it's reconnecting. Can you hear me okay? Oh, yeah, yeah, you're you were cutting out a bit, but I think we're good. Okay, I'm back. Yeah, I was going to say speaking of elevating your status in the herd and your community, if you're a REALTOR, this is one of those powerful things you can do to really elevate your status in whoever's eyes is asking them that question. You know, how can I help you? A lot inside of B&I for the REALTORS in different chapters. B&I is a networking group of chapters of professionals. And so we teach them this as a way to generate referrals for the four partners in their room. And this could be the people that are in your inner circle as a REALTOR, whether you're in a networking group or not. But how can I help you? And then find this, we really need our HFACTS to replace. Or my mom has been having struggles with her need. Oh, we should talk to my physical therapist. I'll get you set up. And finding the solutions, having that network of people around you, whether you're in a structured version of a group or whether that's just your inner circle, people you've developed, relationships. Because that way you're going to stay top of mind in both people's minds. And you're the hero to both of them because you're doing it. And that's not really communication, but I count that as communication because or phrase or communication. Absolutely. I love it. Let's dive into some communication tips. So tell us what are some do's and don'ts in the when you're wanting to be intentional about your communication. Absolutely. So being intentional about communication is the top, right? That is number one. So I've got three tips you're that are prepared specifically for REALTORS that it's going to incredibly powerful for everything you're doing. The first one is this this tip. It really comes from Chris Both. He is a hostage negotiator for the FBI. He's the founder of the Black Swan Group. He's a negotiation master. And he talks about this concept called mirror and labeling. Mirroring is when you're somebody and you repeat what they said, right? It's kind of like that. Like if DJ tells me, oh yeah, last week I went on a vacation to Cancun. I go vacation to Cancun. That's all I have to say. That's a mirror. And then he'd tell me, yeah, we went on the flow rider and we got the most amazing sushi at this restaurant. I'm like sushi. I don't have to say anything else. It's just sushi. You think, oh my goodness, the sushi was amazing. There was mango on it and this thing and this is it was fantastic. Then comes in the part of the labeling. Right? Mirroring is just staying the words. The most interesting, passionate word. And then the labeling is, so it sounds like you had a really good time in Cancun. Labeling the key to a good label is it always starts with. It sounds like it looks like or it seems like. You can have an entire deep level conversation with you just mirroring and labeling. The other person doesn't even realize it. And then like, oh my gosh, the best conversationalists in the world. They care about what I have to say just by labeling and mirroring. So a a because right, we want to talk about what we want to talk about. absolutely. And a practical way to do this for agents is as you're talking to your client and you're getting the sense of what they want in their transaction. So you're looking to buy a home. Great. Tell me about exactly what you want. And you know, you start writing down for bedrooms, for bath, whatever. You know, whatever all of the the once the musts are. And then it sounds like to make sure just to make sure I have this correct. It sounds like you're looking for bang, bang, bang, bang, bang. And what's funny about that is you are just repeating back what they said. But to them, it is like you are speaking this magical language that is exactly in the way they categorize it in their brain. Because you are literally just repeating back what they say. And also it's a good idea to do just so that you are making sure you're calibrating to make sure that you are listening and understanding. But it is it is the funniest thing because you're absolutely right. People will react to it as if you've been there. Like you you have a key to their like the deepest thoughts. Like wow, this guy gets me. So tell us. Yeah, so give us some other tips. What else? Another tip. Let's go with a micro story. Micro stories are so powerful. And this is instead of saying, oh, this dining room is so big. It's so spacious. A micro story. Super simple could be, you know, this is the type of dining room. You could have a Thanksgiving dinner with 12 people. Or this living room is so cozy. This is the kind of living room. We're on a Sunday afternoon. You're just sitting here with your spouse watching the football game. Right. Those little micro stories that paints a picture in people's minds, especially as a REALTOR can be incredibly powerful. But then again, you can apply this to many other things. But REALTOR focused, you sit when describing the house, describing the room, describing what type of vibe they're going to. Now again, this needs authenticity because you need to first connect with that person. No really what they're because if you're talking about, oh, this is where you sit Sunday nights and in watch football. If you're not the type of person that watches sports, you're like, oh, cool. When it ends on deaf ears, I don't care. Right. So using those micro stories. Yeah. And in what agents can do, what do you think in order to make sure they're populated? I get a time. Mike. Oh, sorry. I think we're we're a little out of sync. Apologize for that. I'm sorry. Just cut out a little bit more. It's aggravating. But I was going to stay. Yeah, no, that's okay. So what what I was what I was saying was that, you know, in order to know exactly what those micro stories could entail, that would be a great thing to ask a client. Hey, in your living room, how do you and your spouse anticipate using it? Like what are the activities you do in here? And then you could create a micro story around that the next time it comes around. Because you're right. Like I don't watch a lot of sporting events. So, you know, for my television, that's not a big thing for me. But I do enjoy watching other types of movies and shows. Or, you know, doing other things in that same room. So you're right. Is first big calibrating, finding out what the person's into. And then using that to, you know, sort of bring to life some of these, you know, these in this case rooms. Absolutely. And let's close it out with my third tip for REALTORS inside of communication, which is delivering certainty and conviction. This is huge. This is massively important with REALTORS because you are a rock in an uncertain time for so many people. Moving is stressful. Negotiating a deal is emotional. And so a lot of times people need a rock, just solid, certain person. We're like, oh, yeah, absolutely done. And if you don't know something, it's not a, oh, I don't know. It's, I'm going to find that out. I'm going to get that to you by three o'clock. Or I'm going to get that to you by tomorrow morning. And then follow through with that, but being certain and having conviction as a REALTOR inside of your communication is so important. And there's a way you know you don't have certainty when you're communicating, which is the intonations of your voice. If you're ending a sentence or a word on an uptick like this, it means you don't really know what you're saying. And you're not really hurting a thing. Is anything questioning everything? And don't sound, you don't sound like you're solid doing like you are the rock, but you can depend on in this emotional stressful time. So keeping your intonations either flat or at a downward curve. If you're visualizing that, that really communicates that certainty that a lot of home buyers need. Yeah, that's a, that is a great, great tip. The, there are a lot of people who don't even realize that at the end of their statements, they inflect up. And it's not because they are uncertain. It's just how it, it just sounds uncertain whether they're uncertain or not. And so you're right. It throws you a little bit as the other person, you're like, does this person, it's confusing. So I am 100% in agreement. That is something. And also before we, before we get off of this, you have a very pleasant tonality. Tonality is something that doesn't really get talked about at the very beginning, we mentioned it. It is something that you can practice. You can learn how to have better tonality. You can learn how to change the sound of your voice. It's, it's not an inauthentic thing. It's a skill. And if people spend just a little bit of time studying this and they can study it with you, they will find that people will respond to them totally differently than what they were in the past. Absolutely. Tell us aboutarticulateadvantaged.com. Articulateadvantaged.com But I do one-on-one code virtually and in person, well as keynotes and trainings virtually and in person. But I did want to talk to one last thing, you're talking about the tonality and changing your voice. So many people think it's inauthentic as you're saying to change your voice, because there's a handful of things that as humans, we associate our personality with. And it is incredibly authentic to change your voice, because you are who you've trained yourself to be. You talk the way you do it, just because that's the way you've always talked and you can change it. I could talk with just a random accent. I could start talking like this the entire time. It's not a British accent. It's just a random, I have no clue what this access to forever. And it would be me and I could choose to do this or I could speak in Spanish. And I could never speak English again. And that would be me. People never say, oh my gosh, DJ, you learned how to play the guitar. That's not you. Why are you trying to be somebody you're not? Why are you trying to change who you are? But when we do it with our voices, when we want to have maybe a lower voice or a more resonant voice, or we want to have more emotion and more excitement, or if we just cut out those upper intonations and we change, or we messed with the dynamics of our voice, some people be like, hey, that's not you. But it is you because you're deciding to do it. So that's something really fun. Yeah, actually. And these are things that it's my man world. I love it.
