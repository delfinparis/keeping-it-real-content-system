[00:02:16] My conversation with Rachel Adams Lee.
[00:02:31] Okay, today on the show, our guest is Rachel Adams Lee from the Rachel Adams Lee group
[00:02:36] in Northern California.
[00:02:38] Let me tell you more about Rachel.
[00:02:40] Now, Rachel Adams Lee is just a small town girl making moves.
[00:02:43] She is a top 1000 agent in the US.
[00:02:47] She is also a multi-passionate entrepreneur and mother of three boys.

[00:03:19] She is five feet tall.
[00:03:21] It loves all things social media, obsessed with having a healthy marriage.
[00:03:24] What a great thing to be obsessed about.
[00:03:26] And thinks Nutella should be its own food group.
[00:03:29] I might disagree, but I think Nutella is a, I think Nutella is somehow hardwired for
[00:03:34] females more so than males in my experience.

[00:04:24] Thank you.
[00:04:25] I'm stoked to be here.
[00:04:26] Send you guys all the vibes from Northern California.
[00:04:30] Well, that's what Californians are good at vibes.
[00:04:32] That's what we don't, you know, I'm in the Midwest.
[00:04:36] We don't that word.
[00:04:38] We don't even know how to interpret that word here.
[00:04:41] But we do love California vibes.
[00:04:44] Of course, everyone does.
[00:04:46] Let's start before we get into all the cool social stuff.
[00:04:49] And by the way, the stuff I'm, when Rachel starts telling her story about the success
[00:04:54] she's been having and her team's been having with social,
[00:04:56] you are absolutely going to want to hear this.
[00:04:59] It's shocking.
[00:05:00] And I've been doing this for six years.
[00:05:01] And I've had countless people on here who have social strategies.
[00:05:05] Rachel strategy is really, really awesome.
[00:05:08] So hang tight for that.
[00:05:09] But Rachel, let's start at the beginning.
[00:05:11] How did you get into real estate?
[00:05:13] Oh, let's go back.
[00:05:14] OK, so I got real estate in 2012.
[00:05:17] So my grandma was a REALTOR.
[00:05:19] My dad was a broker for 42 years.
[00:05:21] And I always said I would never, ever go into real estate.
[00:05:23] By the way, everybody who has parents that are in real estate say the exact same thing.
[00:05:28] And my boss, same thing.
[00:05:29] But go ahead.
[00:05:30] Honestly, though, I feel like the reason was because no one talked about work,
[00:05:34] like balance back then.
[00:05:35] Like my dad, I had an awesome childhood, but my dad would like mist,
[00:05:38] or sometimes because he was doing showing some stuff like that.
[00:05:40] And I just was like, I never want to have that.
[00:05:43] You know?
[00:05:45] And I found myself in 2012 working at a real estate office.
[00:05:50] And I was unlicensed.
[00:05:51] And I was in a really unhealthy marriage at that point in my life.
[00:05:53] My ex-husband was 80% disabled, but 50% was PTSD for the Marine Corps.
[00:05:58] So I spent my days at the office like, you're going to get your offer accepted.
[00:06:02] You got this.
[00:06:02] And I got my, spent my nights like crying myself to sleep,
[00:06:05] because I was just a really direct spot.
[00:06:07] And I knew I wanted my life to change, but I didn't know what that looked like.
[00:06:10] And I remember seeing all these paychecks coming through the REALTORS.
[00:06:12] And I was like, gosh, there's so much more money than I was making.
[00:06:15] But I was making $15 that I could count on every, you know?
[00:06:18] And so it was like, OK, stability versus instability.
[00:06:21] The thing I'd never done is like bet on myself.
[00:06:24] So I decided that I would do an accelerated program.
[00:06:28] I got my license in 90 days.
[00:06:29] And I jumped into real estate.
[00:06:31] When I jumped into real estate, I want to state was with both feet.
[00:06:34] Because literally my first year, DJ, I'm knocking 200 doors a week
[00:06:39] and doing three open houses every week.
[00:06:42] So knocking 200 doors, doing three open houses.
[00:06:44] And I didn't sell any homes for the first four months.
[00:06:46] So I got the rejection you face and the amount of like,
[00:06:50] but also the grit you get.
[00:06:51] And like what I always said, people like, how do you keep doing that?
[00:06:54] Like that's four months with nothing.
[00:06:56] And I was like, my why?
[00:06:58] Like why I was doing this was bigger than any excuse that I could come up with.
[00:07:01] Like I had to change my life.
[00:07:04] So I didn't sell any homes for the first four months,
[00:07:05] but I ended up selling 39 homes that first year.
[00:07:08] And then 100.
[00:07:09] Hold on, hold on.
[00:07:10] I want to pause for dramatic effect.
[00:07:12] We're going to do what's called a pregnant pause.
[00:07:16] 39 homes in your first year with really not
[00:07:19] a, I'm assuming not a tremendous influence or no, I'd never even looked at a listing presentation
[00:07:26] by a presentation.
[00:07:28] Because like I, I was in all different industries before that I was like a small
[00:07:32] yay to talk people how to do food and wine pairing.
[00:07:34] Like I did, you know, was in restaurants.
[00:07:36] Like I didn't do the real estate stuff.
[00:07:39] And so it took me some time to get traction going.
[00:07:42] But what I did during those those first four months and really that first year,
[00:07:45] like I wrote my listing presentation 100 times for 100 days every day for 100 days.
[00:07:51] I mastered script practice like I, I wanted to overcome every objection.
[00:07:56] So when it came I wasn't nervous.
[00:07:58] So if I didn't have the clients, I pretended that I did.
[00:08:01] So I was like a really a student of the game.
[00:08:03] So I sold 39 homes for first year, then 109 the next year, and then 123.
[00:08:08] So three years in I hit Wall Street Journal's top 1000 agents in the country.
[00:08:12] We still have that today.
[00:08:15] And I, you know, I really, I wanted to, I wanted to make an impact on my community.
[00:08:22] I wanted to be in a healthy marriage.
[00:08:24] I wanted to have kids.
[00:08:25] I wanted to be a mom like all these things were important to me.
[00:08:29] And so I knew that like I love doing the door knocking me up in houses.
[00:08:33] The thing is you can have one conversation with one person at a time.
[00:08:36] So the belly to belly is really important.
[00:08:38] But I also wanted like more.
[00:08:40] And so I decided I would really start to like focus on social media because if I did social media,
[00:08:45] I would choose when I respond to people.
[00:08:47] I choose when I post like I could make a business model around social media.
[00:08:51] And I never heard of anyone doing that.
[00:08:53] And I'm a systems girl.
[00:08:54] That's the only way I can survive having a four year old, a year and nine month old and a nine month old.
[00:08:59] So I have to have systems in my world.
[00:09:03] And so I created a business model around social media.
[00:09:06] And like the first year we had 17 referrals come in.
[00:09:09] Then it was like 30 than 50.
[00:09:11] But last year we had 131 referrals come through social.
[00:09:14] And that's through Facebook, Instagram and YouTube.
[00:09:17] So life looks very different now.
[00:09:18] I'm a real estate coach.
[00:09:19] I love love teaching people how to build their businesses.
[00:09:25] I travel the country speaking.
[00:09:28] I travel with my family.
[00:09:29] So whenever I'm in a conference, I bring my littles and my nanny and my husband and it's wild.
[00:09:35] But it's really fun.
[00:09:36] If you're wondering if you're noticing that Rachel speaks quickly, that's because she has to,
[00:09:41] because she has three little ones to attend to and four businesses to run.
[00:09:45] But guys, how great is this, this Rachel?
[00:09:48] And I don't, I'm not saying to speak slowly more slowly.
[00:09:51] I just love the fact that you got a lot to do.
[00:09:54] Incapable of it.
[00:09:54] And I'm told hanging out with me is like taking a shot of espresso so good morning everybody.
[00:09:59] I know I love it.
[00:10:00] I love it.
[00:10:00] I'm kind of the same way I have to remind myself to just load on.
[00:10:04] But everything you're saying is so gold.
[00:10:06] Gold and I want you to get as much in as possible through this episode.
[00:10:10] So let's talk about social media.
[00:10:12] You know what I'd like to maybe start with is what do most agents not understand about social media?
[00:10:18] Or what are they go wrong?
[00:10:20] That's a great question.
[00:10:21] So I think the thing with most REALTORS, I'll try to slow it down all of
[00:10:25] that because I get really excited.
[00:10:26] No, no, no, do not slow it down.
[00:10:27] You're perfect.
[00:10:28] I just love how fast you talk.
[00:10:29] Oh, you're good.
[00:10:30] So I think one of the biggest mistakes REALTORS make is they make their social media all
[00:10:34] about them and all about real estate.
[00:10:35] And they think that like, if look at this house, they just sold, look at my new listing.
[00:10:39] Look at this award.
[00:10:40] I got look at me.
[00:10:40] Look at me.
[00:10:41] And what you don't realize is that people might find you because you're in real estate,
[00:10:45] but they stick around because of who you are and how you make them feel.
[00:10:50] So you know, one of the biggest mistakes REALTORS make is just talking about real estate.
[00:10:54] So when I'm talking to people with social, I say you need to make your social media
[00:10:57] like an 80, 20 principle.
[00:10:59] 80% of what you post is actually going to be you.
[00:11:01] Who you are, what you're doing, what you're reading, what you're eating, you know, like why
[00:11:05] what makes you tick, why somebody would hang out with you on the weekend.
[00:11:08] And 20% is only going to be real estate.
[00:11:10] 20% is real estate.
[00:11:11] But you know what you could do?
[00:11:12] You could be watching or listening to this podcast right now, take all these notes.
[00:11:17] And then you're going to have the business model by the end of this for how to build a business
[00:11:21] through social media.
[00:11:22] Then you, as a REALTOR, go on your social media and you make a post and say, you know,
[00:11:26] it was just hanging out with DJ Paris and he interviewed a top 1000 agent in the country
[00:11:31] about how she got 131 referrals last year.
[00:11:34] I would love to share those notes with you.
[00:11:35] If you want to copy my notes, leave your email below.
[00:11:38] You, as a REALTOR, if you can be the person who's always adding value to others,
[00:11:43] when they need to buy a sell or they have a referral for your location, they're going to think of you.
[00:11:49] So what I do in my world is I think, okay, how can every single day when I woke up, I was like,
[00:11:54] how can I add value to others?
[00:11:56] How can I add value to others?
[00:11:57] My clients and my community.
[00:11:59] So like being the local experts.
[00:12:00] So it's October, right?
[00:12:02] So I'm sharing where to look at the local pump-compatients.
[00:12:06] I love it.
[00:12:06] If it's a matter, right?
[00:12:07] I'm doing a pie giveaway.
[00:12:09] If it's December, I'm sharing, you know, where to see the local Christmas tree like locations.
[00:12:15] Like you can google this stuff for free, then go on Canva, get a free account,
[00:12:20] and make it look a graphic.
[00:12:22] And the thing is, if you're always adding value to people,
[00:12:25] then your platform becomes a place they want to hang out.
[00:12:28] And, you know, the algorithm is like this weird tricky place,
[00:12:31] but the simplest way to think of the algorithm, because you hear that word thrown a lot around a lot,
[00:12:36] it is, it is your impact and your influence you have on social media.
[00:12:40] It's like whatever you're looking at, the goal of Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, Snapchat,
[00:12:44] all of them.
[00:12:45] The goal is to keep you on the platform as long as possible.
[00:12:48] So if you're looking at a specific niche, they're going to give you more of that to keep you on it.
[00:12:52] The trick is how you as a REALTOR, the person that they want to be in front of.
[00:12:57] And that's what my model goes through.
[00:12:59] Yeah, it's no, you just said so much there.
[00:13:02] And I want to go back to some of the non real estate stuff, like community focused stuff.
[00:13:06] So this I feel is one of the biggest missed opportunities for REALTORS.
[00:13:10] Because if we think about like, if you're whatever you're into, maybe, you know,
[00:13:14] you're a mom with little ones.
[00:13:15] So you could create content specific to mothers who are working, maybe you have children,
[00:13:21] and you could do stuff about, hey, I have some resources for moms who are trying to do it all.
[00:13:26] It could be totally unrelated to real estate or it could be, hey, here's some really cool
[00:13:30] events that are going on in our area for moms with little kids or here's some, you know,
[00:13:35] mom meetups or it could be, here's what's going on for Labor Day.
[00:13:38] If you don't have plans, do that.
[00:13:40] I, this, now we're talking about value and we, and what you said is so important is you have to think,
[00:13:46] what do my, you know, look, when somebody's ready to buy or sell a home,
[00:13:49] yes, they want some of that real estate content.
[00:13:51] But in between five to seven years of them not buying or selling a home,
[00:13:55] you probably don't care that much about you selling doing a listing.
[00:13:58] I mean, it's cool.
[00:13:59] It's good, but we want to, you want to get them hooked on your content is what I'm hearing from you.
[00:14:03] Yes.
[00:14:04] Absolutely.
[00:14:05] Yeah, you really want to, so with social media, you're either doing of one of two things.
[00:14:09] You're either educating people or you're entertaining.
[00:14:12] You're either educating or entertaining.
[00:14:14] And if you're really doing social media high level, you do it a balance of both.
[00:14:17] And I think people get so caught up because they're like, I don't even know what to post about.
[00:14:21] No one cares about the fact that like my, you know, I sit in my office, my dog at my feet.
[00:14:24] Yes, they freaking do.
[00:14:26] Oh, they love it.
[00:14:27] Right.
[00:14:28] And so like when I, if you're going to build a business through social media,
[00:14:31] I want you to write down one through five.
[00:14:33] You're literally done one, two, three, four, five.
[00:14:35] Number one, you're going to write down real estate because that's the industry that we're all in.
[00:14:38] But then two through five, you're going to make it personal to you.
[00:14:42] What makes you tick?
[00:14:43] If you were in an elevator and someone said, okay, tell me about yourself.
[00:14:46] What are some things you like?
[00:14:48] That's your five things.
[00:14:49] That's the other four.
[00:14:50] So like real, for me, I do real estate and being an entrepreneur.
[00:14:53] I talk about being a wife and a mom because that's my number one, right?
[00:14:56] I talk about personal growth because I'm always on a journey to be like the best version of myself.
[00:15:01] I talk about positive body image because it's something that I struggle with.
[00:15:05] And after having three kids and the last one being an emergency C section,
[00:15:10] like my, my body has changed a lot.
[00:15:12] And I had fertility and we've had four losses.
[00:15:14] And like I've really had this like journey to become a mom.
[00:15:17] And you know, it is something I talk about.
[00:15:20] I wasn't going to talk about it on social media.
[00:15:22] But I found myself like silently struggling.
[00:15:24] And I was like, man, I have a super killer support system and I'm struggling.
[00:15:29] Yeah, imagine what everyone else who doesn't have that support.
[00:15:32] And by the way, what percentage of women struggle with, what percentage of humans, but certainly women,
[00:15:38] I mean, this is 99% of women struggle with body image because of how we as a society project,
[00:15:43] what women are supposed to look like.
[00:15:45] And obviously it's very, we all know how tough women have it.
[00:15:48] So that's a great, great thing to talk about.
[00:15:50] Yeah. And I just think like, you know, and it can,
[00:15:53] the cool thing too is your four passions can change before I had kids.
[00:15:56] That was not something I talked about.
[00:15:58] But after I had kids like positive body image became one of my focal points of my life.
[00:16:02] So it's something that I want to talk about with others.
[00:16:05] And so you come up with these different things that help you define who you are as a person.
[00:16:09] And then remember, people will find you because you're in real estate.
[00:16:12] But they stick around because of who you are and how you make them feel.
[00:16:15] And so you get really intentional on going through these.
[00:16:17] And like if you go on my Instagram and you look at like the grid,
[00:16:20] right, like the little pictures, you'll literally see me go through these topics.
[00:16:24] And you know, if, if you join my real estate team today,
[00:16:27] you actually have to sign a social media addendum that says you'll post at least three times a week,
[00:16:32] three times a week.
[00:16:33] Wow, it's part, it's part of the agreement to work with you.
[00:16:35] I love it.
[00:16:36] Oh, absolutely.
[00:16:36] Because if you're not doing social media as a REALTOR now,
[00:16:39] you're going to get left behind.
[00:16:41] And you know, one of the big things that we really are focusing on now is video.
[00:16:45] Yeah, you know, you know, it's funny.
[00:16:48] I want to pause for a second because I wanted to get your take on this.
[00:16:50] I'm curious to get, I have an opinion about this,
[00:16:52] but I'll wait to hear your opinion first.
[00:16:54] Although maybe I'll be leading leading you on this one.
[00:16:57] I'll try not to.
[00:16:59] What do you think the role of websites, personal websites are going to be going forward?
[00:17:06] Are they going to be less important, more important,
[00:17:09] neutral, meaning an agent with their own website?
[00:17:12] Yeah, I think that your web, you need to have a website because it can be linked to your
[00:17:16] MLS, right, for IDX.
[00:17:18] So like you can first search portals and if you're doing at and stuff like that.
[00:17:22] But otherwise your social media is your website.
[00:17:24] Yes, yes.
[00:17:26] Stop working on your websites, everybody.
[00:17:28] First of all, you're, and your SEO, you're not going to compete with the other people who are already
[00:17:33] locked in those SEO results for top, you know, two, one to three searches on,
[00:17:37] or one to three positions on the search of Google.
[00:17:39] Anything under one to three, no one clicks on it anyway.
[00:17:42] So don't try to play that game because, again, have a nice looking website.
[00:17:46] Like you said, have an IDX search built in so people can search instead of going to
[00:17:50] Zillow or Redfin.
[00:17:50] They're going to maybe use your site.
[00:17:52] But realize that not going to hang out on your website.
[00:17:55] One thing that I want you to look at.
[00:17:57] So go, you can do it right now.
[00:17:59] It's too sorry.
[00:18:00] And that's a real one.
[00:18:00] I was just doing this morning.
[00:18:02] Okay, so if you go to my Instagram right now, so you go to Rachel Adamsley,
[00:18:06] what you're going to see is like the first line.
[00:18:09] So you want to be really intentional.
[00:18:10] So this is like a class for you guys on editing your bios.
[00:18:13] You want when somebody goes to your social media, you want it to within one second,
[00:18:18] they know exactly what they're looking at.
[00:18:19] So first, your profile has to be public.
[00:18:21] You cannot build a social media presence with a private profile.
[00:18:26] Because if you click on my page and I'm private, then you accept you add for me to be your friend
[00:18:30] or whatever follow by the time that I accept you, you've forgotten who I am because you've
[00:18:34] done 15 things that day.
[00:18:35] So what the very first line you see is Rachel Adamsley,
[00:18:39] top 1000 REALTOR in business coach.
[00:18:41] The next thing you see is social media experts.
[00:18:43] So my credibility, right?
[00:18:45] And where I serve California REALTORS, you've got to say your REALTOR on your social media.
[00:18:51] And you have to say the area you serve.
[00:18:54] Because if you want referrals, so think about this, I had 131 referrals come through last year.
[00:18:58] A huge portion of those are agents around the country.
[00:19:01] The rest are client and community, right?
[00:19:03] But you want to make sure that you always say the area that you serve,
[00:19:07] because then it gives people to know where they can give you referrals.
[00:19:11] And they're constantly moving coming to your profile and getting value and laughing and
[00:19:14] connecting and feeling and cue your there, buddy.
[00:19:16] And then by the way, you happen to serve that area.
[00:19:19] And then you continue moving on.
[00:19:21] And so the third line down is really where I do credibility.
[00:19:24] So you can say how many houses you sold or if you haven't,
[00:19:27] if you don't have the credibility behind you yet, you know,
[00:19:29] you're with the top brokerage, like whatever you want to say there.
[00:19:33] And then my fourth line down is my personal steps.
[00:19:35] I'm a wife and a working mama with three boys.
[00:19:38] And then the line after that is a call to action.
[00:19:41] So if you, your call to action could be like, click here to find out how your
[00:19:46] much your home is worth.
[00:19:47] But you always want to have something for them to do.
[00:19:50] You'll notice like if you go on my social media,
[00:19:52] and let's talk about Reels for a minute.
[00:19:55] Let's talk about video because it is the number one thing the algorithm favors
[00:19:59] above all else right now.
[00:20:01] I spent a lot of time working on Reels and doing video.
[00:20:04] And we have something we can talk about a little bit for you guys that will help.
[00:20:07] And what you'll notice is if you go look at the Reels
[00:20:11] and you click on them and you literally go over just to look at the Reels,
[00:20:15] you're going to see what is called a hook.
[00:20:18] So what people don't realize is when people, someone's scrolling on social,
[00:20:21] you actually only have two seconds, two freaking seconds to stop the scroll
[00:20:26] and see if what you're posting about is something they want.
[00:20:28] So your hook that, so what you do is when you create your video,
[00:20:32] you have the hook on the screen literally for two seconds.
[00:20:34] When you use editing apps, like I use one called InShot,
[00:20:37] you can keep it on there for two seconds and then you move forward.
[00:20:41] So like one says how I gain 6,000 followers in three months.
[00:20:46] Another one says how I got a $1.7 million buyer from an open house.
[00:20:49] Check out my system.
[00:20:51] How to hack the algorithm.
[00:20:53] Best recording equipment for your videos to go viral.
[00:20:56] How to lose 10 pounds with Chad GPT.
[00:20:59] Like these are hooks.
[00:21:01] These are things that literally are going to stop people and they're going to say,
[00:21:04] oh, I want to learn about that.
[00:21:05] But if I don't have an eye catching something on there,
[00:21:08] then they scroll past so many ReelTers.
[00:21:10] Like one of the big mistakes they do, DJ, is they'll be like,
[00:21:12] hey guys, my name's Rachel and today gone.
[00:21:15] Lost him.
[00:21:16] Who cares?
[00:21:16] My name is.
[00:21:17] What am I going to talk about?
[00:21:18] That's what you have to have the second.
[00:21:20] I want to make two quick points
[00:21:22] that I'd for clarifying.
[00:21:24] So when she's talking about a hook,
[00:21:25] what we're really thinking about is when we're scrolling on YouTube.
[00:21:28] So let's think about YouTube for a second.
[00:21:31] The videos that tend to perform the best have sort of title cards.
[00:21:35] So what we're really talking about with Rachel saying is we're creating
[00:21:38] sort of title cards within a reel.
[00:21:40] So the first, so that way when they're when they're listed,
[00:21:43] as you she was saying to scroll through,
[00:21:45] you literally without even having to click on the video,
[00:21:47] you can see exactly what the video is.
[00:21:50] That is huge.
[00:21:51] And I believe Rachel, you may have to correct me on this.
[00:21:55] I believe once you upload a reel into Instagram,
[00:21:58] I don't believe you can edit or add a cover after the fact.
[00:22:02] I made me wrong.
[00:22:02] Yes.
[00:22:03] So I've made this mistake a million times
[00:22:05] or I've uploaded Reels.
[00:22:07] They don't have a title card or the first two seconds
[00:22:09] that show what we're going to be with written out.
[00:22:11] And you're right.
[00:22:12] Nobody knows what it is.
[00:22:13] Yeah.
[00:22:14] Yeah.
[00:22:14] So you you really need to have that done ahead of time.
[00:22:17] And the title card, like he's saying,
[00:22:18] so the cover page, like that is important for when that's important
[00:22:24] for when you are like creating a reel for your page
[00:22:28] and someone's scrolling on your content.
[00:22:30] But if they're not on your page and you get to the explore page
[00:22:33] where I'm at a lot,
[00:22:34] that's where you need to have the two for the the hook
[00:22:38] on there for the two seconds.
[00:22:39] Because that's where you're going to grab them.
[00:22:41] Now quick, quick question.
[00:22:43] So I've got about, I don't know, maybe 50 Reels
[00:22:46] for this podcast where you grab little we just started grabbing moments
[00:22:49] and doing 60 second videos.
[00:22:51] Yeah, we did not think about title cards.
[00:22:54] So would it make sense to pull all of those down add title cards,
[00:22:58] re upload them as as new posts just because it would probably get more visibility or.
[00:23:05] Is it moving forward?
[00:23:06] No, because that's like deleting all your social media and starting fresh.
[00:23:09] It's like when's the best time to plan to tree?
[00:23:12] Right.
[00:23:12] Right.
[00:23:13] Plant the seed now.
[00:23:14] Yeah.
[00:23:14] Yeah, yesterday I can't so do it today.
[00:23:17] So you just start moving forward.
[00:23:18] So your next title card will be here.
[00:23:20] And you just again, you want to pull the hooks.
[00:23:22] And I have what I can do for your listeners actually.
[00:23:25] I have a website that I'll give you where if you go to I think it's called Rachel's freebies.
[00:23:31] Yeah, go to Rachel's freebies.com.
[00:23:34] That will give them 20 free hooks.
[00:23:36] So it will give them 20.
[00:23:37] So they can use right now on their social media,
[00:23:39] which you guys can put that in the show notes.
[00:23:40] But if you go to Rachel's freebies,
[00:23:43] that'll give them 20 hooks they can use right now on their social media.
[00:23:46] I also wanted to make one point.
[00:23:48] This is just a little aside that I noticed when I was searching for you on Instagram.
[00:23:53] And I want everybody not don't just go directly to Rachel's Instagram.
[00:23:58] Go to Google, search Rachel Adams Lee Instagram.
[00:24:01] And I want you to notice the font that comes up on Google when it shows the result.
[00:24:08] It is a unique font because Rachel was very smart.
[00:24:11] And realize that when you use a unique font on Instagram,
[00:24:15] it actually pulls that into the Google snippet when people are search on Google.
[00:24:20] And it is so unique.
[00:24:21] It drew my eye immediately to it.
[00:24:23] I was like, whoa, did Google change their fonts all of a sudden?
[00:24:25] No, just for Rachel because when you go to her Instagram page,
[00:24:29] you will see her name is in a unique font that is not by accident.
[00:24:32] That is not a mistake.
[00:24:33] That is notice how your eyes go straight to that.
[00:24:36] That's a little tiny thing I noticed.
[00:24:37] And it's a little fancy font.
[00:24:39] If you guys it's a free app, you can download it.
[00:24:41] It's called a fancy font.
[00:24:42] And so like whenever I'm writing emails, whenever,
[00:24:44] like when I do captions on social media, I use a lot.
[00:24:47] If I want you to see something, I capitalize it and I bold it because I wanted to grab
[00:24:51] your attention because it grabs mine.
[00:24:52] And I'm going a million miles a minute.
[00:24:54] So like I have to have stuff that's like, stop.
[00:24:56] This is important.
[00:24:57] Read this.
[00:24:59] Either way, you know the story you and I talked about before we went live about how.
[00:25:04] So I was telling him about how I got a phone call today from someone who is going through a divorce
[00:25:10] and she was saying she needs to find a REALTOR.
[00:25:13] And she said she was talking to her daughter at the gym about how she needs a REALTOR.
[00:25:16] And her 17 year old daughter was like, I follow this girl on Instagram.
[00:25:19] Why don't you call her?
[00:25:20] She found me because of a real you guys.
[00:25:22] The reals are the number one thing that algorithm favors and it will push you
[00:25:26] above other people in the feed.
[00:25:29] And so but the reason I brought it up as well, we're talking my phone rang and it was the
[00:25:33] attorney and some like, oh, it's so hard.
[00:25:35] Because I'm like, can I just pause this so I can go get that piece of business?
[00:25:38] Nope.
[00:25:38] I'm time blocked.
[00:25:39] This is the one thing I will tell you that makes you sick guys time blocking.
[00:25:43] Like my number one focus right now is doing this podcast with DJ because I committed to it.
[00:25:47] I'm time blocked for it as soon as I'm done with him.
[00:25:49] I'm going to call back that attorney and I'm going to post a real that I was editing right before I got on here.
[00:25:54] So like my whole life is time blocked.
[00:25:56] But you can do you can build this business.
[00:25:58] You can have the kids.
[00:25:59] You can do the things you want to do if you time block.
[00:26:02] When I did the door knocking the open houses, I time blocked for it.
[00:26:05] I would I would doork two hours a day and I could hit about 75 doors in those two hours with social media.
[00:26:11] I'll give you guys a system for how you can lead generate through social media for two hours.
[00:26:18] All my lead generation is in two hours because that's like as long as my attention span can last before I'm like,
[00:26:23] oh, it's not good.
[00:26:25] But you know, that's that's a success.
[00:26:27] If you can master time blocking as a REALTOR, like you can do this.
[00:26:32] Yeah, and it's we're talking about turn the phone off or put it face down and don't because
[00:26:38] things are going to be flying at you as we all know.
[00:26:41] Things fly at you all day long and it's easy.
[00:26:44] I'm if you're like me, you just get distracted by any shiny object.
[00:26:46] So good idea.
[00:26:48] Now, so let's talk about content again.
[00:26:51] So we understand the the importance of of reals and what a real is at least on an Instagram.
[00:26:56] I believe is 90 seconds the max.
[00:26:58] I can't remember 60 or 90.
[00:27:00] Yeah, so short form video.
[00:27:01] It can be 90 seconds or less, but I'll be totally transparent with you like the easiest
[00:27:06] reels that go trending and viral are like 10 seconds or less.
[00:27:11] And even seven seconds because what you do.
[00:27:14] So a real will play twice in a row for someone who's watching it.
[00:27:17] It's called looping.
[00:27:17] It will play twice in a row for someone that's watching it.
[00:27:20] And so what you do is the way you want to think about reels.
[00:27:24] Like that the strategy behind it is in this kind of consent a little overwhelming,
[00:27:29] but I'll give you something at the end that will make it easy.
[00:27:31] So you're going to record your video.
[00:27:32] Okay.
[00:27:33] And you're going to come up with your topic.
[00:27:35] You're going to know what you're going to do.
[00:27:36] So you're going to record your video for let's like my best ones are like seven seconds long.
[00:27:41] No joke.
[00:27:42] So seven seconds long.
[00:27:43] You're you literally can record you typing at a computer and smiling for seven seconds.
[00:27:48] Then you're going to come up with your hook.
[00:27:50] So whatever the video is going to be about.
[00:27:52] And you're going to put it on the top of the screen for two seconds.
[00:27:55] Then you're going to have two more things you're going to share with them.
[00:27:58] And then you can be like see caption.
[00:28:00] What I will tell you is the real is two is to entertain them.
[00:28:04] Where you educate them and you position yourself as the expert is in the caption below.
[00:28:08] Because what you're going to notice on all of my reels like I have one that I put up
[00:28:11] earlier this week.
[00:28:13] And it talks about I think I was like at 60,000 views like as of this morning.
[00:28:17] And it talks it talks about how things that depreciate and value as soon as you buy them.
[00:28:23] And I just said your car.
[00:28:25] Your designer purse.
[00:28:27] Osayi Bulls like I made it kind of funny.
[00:28:29] And then I was like things that don't real estate.
[00:28:31] And it is a five second video you guys all I'm doing is walking towards a camera for five
[00:28:36] seconds. And then in the caption I educate.
[00:28:39] And I'm like let's talk about why real estate is important to build wealth.
[00:28:43] And so I position myself as the expert in the caption.
[00:28:47] But in that I'm using 30 hashtags six or geo hashtags.
[00:28:51] So people are like the hashtags matter.
[00:28:53] They do matter.
[00:28:54] They're not going to make or break your content.
[00:28:56] But they do help.
[00:28:56] And if you can get more followers why the heck not.
[00:28:59] So hashtags I want to think of hashtags like Google.
[00:29:03] So if someone's looking for a REALTOR like a top luxury REALTOR they could type in luxury
[00:29:08] and thousands hundreds of thousands of REALTORS have used that hashtag.
[00:29:12] But if it's like Sacramento, luxury real estate Sacramento there's going to be a lot fewer
[00:29:16] that are going to pop up and my reals are good so they're going to grab them.
[00:29:20] So with hashtags like the video like the
[00:29:26] system I would say for a video is like you're going to record it.
[00:29:29] You're going to edit it and I use in shot like I said you're going to put your words on the screen.
[00:29:33] I do want you to put words on the screen because 80% of people are watching
[00:29:37] your videos without the sound on because they're watching them at work when they should be working.
[00:29:43] So you want to make sure you tell them what it's going to be about on the screen.
[00:29:46] And then also this is like super heady but like the algorithm it's called alternative text
[00:29:51] and keywords.
[00:29:53] They're watching the words you put on the screen and that is going to be fed to the people out there
[00:29:57] that are looking in your genre.
[00:30:00] And then trending audio is the other piece.
[00:30:02] So the trending audio makes a massive difference on your real and you just look for that
[00:30:07] little arrow in the bottom left screen that's going up and that is how you find the trending audio.
[00:30:12] And let's explain what trending audio is.
[00:30:15] Okay so trending audio is the music that you hear on a reel that has a certain amount of uses
[00:30:21] that is catching into the algorithm so it's going to push it out in front of more people.
[00:30:26] So I only post reels with trending audio because I know the system and how to make it go
[00:30:31] have a better chance of going viral and getting in front of more people.
[00:30:34] But again I'm targeting REALTORS because I want referrals from REALTORS around the country
[00:30:38] and I'm targeting buyers and sellers in my local community because I want them to position
[00:30:42] me as a local expert.
[00:30:44] And do your reels are they ever more than let's say 10 seconds or so or are they usually within
[00:30:50] that seven second?
[00:30:51] They are.
[00:30:52] So like when I'm educating when I'm teaching about something, they're a little bit longer.
[00:30:57] I have one that I was like not sure how it would do because it's like I think it was like 84
[00:31:02] seconds or something but I was teaching people about this rule that I call the 555 which is how
[00:31:08] you wake up the algorithm when you make a post so they get more eyes on your content.
[00:31:13] So I was teaching them about it says like how to hack the algorithm and get more eyes on your
[00:31:16] content. That's my hook.
[00:31:18] And then I'm teaching them an idea about the rule of 555.
[00:31:22] And so that is definitely a little bit of a longer one.
[00:31:27] And I want and you also you test it out because my audience is different than your audience.
[00:31:31] So what works for me that the short reels where you entertain them and educate work for everybody.
[00:31:37] But like my audience knows that I'm going to teach them how to build a business as well.
[00:31:41] So like I'm going to educate if you don't do that you might do one where you say why it's
[00:31:46] important to get a home inspection.
[00:31:48] Like and that's your hook right why it's important to get a home inspection.
[00:31:51] And then or like three mistakes every buyer makes when not getting a home inspection too not
[00:31:57] getting approved for a loan like you know what I mean.
[00:31:59] And then you educate them below anyone can do that.
[00:32:03] Question about hashtags. So you said something that struck me as as interesting because I have heard
[00:32:09] I've heard a lot of different opinions on on hashtagging. So I have heard that Instagram
[00:32:15] prefers keeping the number of hashtags under six. You use 30. So can you speak a little bit to
[00:32:20] and I know you've tested it all. So is that sort of an old wives tale that only keep a few hashtags
[00:32:26] per person. So the algorithm is always changing always changing. The most you can have is 30.
[00:32:33] The least you could have is one but you don't get penalized for having 30. So I
[00:32:38] use it. I again I'm a systems person. I'm not like what are the number six that I need to do
[00:32:43] screw that I have 30. My six are in there pick the six you want. You know what I mean.
[00:32:47] Like I don't you're not getting you don't get like you don't get hurt for having more hashtags.
[00:32:52] Got it because I know at some point in social media there was like what we would call like keyword
[00:32:57] stuffing and people would just you know inflate but I guess the point is Instagram doesn't really care
[00:33:03] how many how many hashtags you have if the content is keeping people engaged for that amount of time
[00:33:08] that they're watching they don't care. And if you have crappy content and you just can't have all these
[00:33:13] keywords in hashtags then yeah maybe they would downvote that but you're absolutely right it's
[00:33:19] all about the quality of the content. Yeah for sure. Okay go ahead. Do you want to talk about
[00:33:25] so one thing I can we can talk about is how they can convert a follower into a client
[00:33:31] because I think that's a really important conversation. Huge. Okay so you're going to have all
[00:33:36] these people following you and what you don't realize is right now only seven to 10 percent of
[00:33:41] your friends are seeing what you're doing seven to 10 percent of your friends. By the way at
[00:33:45] best it might it might even be like three percent yeah. Yeah like think about all the people you
[00:33:49] have in your on your social media but you see the same stories the same post the same feed
[00:33:54] and the rule is if you're not seeing them they're not seeing you. So every single month all my
[00:34:00] social media clients what we do is we take pen to paper and we write down 25 names of people
[00:34:05] that were already friends with on social but we're not seeing their content anymore. So you could
[00:34:10] pick your 25 it could be 25 local business owners it could be 25 realtorch from around the
[00:34:15] country it could be 25 past clients it could be 25 people from your church but each month you're
[00:34:20] going to pick 25 people and then this is the way that you get in front of the people who you're
[00:34:25] already friends with but they're not seeing your content. So it's called my rule of 555. So five
[00:34:31] minutes before you make a post you comment on five people's post a comment of five words or more.
[00:34:38] Okay let's let's go on a backup. So here's what we're talking about. I just want to make sure this
[00:34:42] is really clear because this is absolutely an idea that not one person has ever shared and the six
[00:34:48] years and 500 episodes we've done this. So here's what here's what Rachel is saying. So she's
[00:34:52] saying one thing to know is that very few a very small percentage of your followers on social
[00:34:58] are actually going to see your posts organically under 10% for sure. So how do we get in front of
[00:35:04] that additional 90 plus percent what she does is before she oh well well we first start out is
[00:35:11] the other thing she said was one way to sort of see who might be seeing your stuff and who might not
[00:35:15] is it's this one-to-one relationship. If you are seeing their reels their posts odds are they
[00:35:21] are probably seeing yours as well but since we know most aren't you can take a look and you can
[00:35:26] make an assumption that if you're not seeing theirs they're not seeing yours you're going to make a
[00:35:29] list of those people and then five minutes before you actually post you are go ahead. Yeah so five
[00:35:34] minutes before you make a post you comment on five of those people's posts a comment of five
[00:35:39] words or more and then what that does so they're there are people who like you who love you who
[00:35:43] actually want to refer business to you but you're not top of mind for them right like and so the
[00:35:48] way you stay top of mind is being in front of them and then once they start to engage with your
[00:35:52] stuff you're in there and you're not talking about real estate so they're not like oh my god shut
[00:35:57] up they're like wow she's doing this with her kids oh she went on this vacation she read this book
[00:36:01] she's going through this with her body like and they start to have things in common with me and then
[00:36:05] they're like oh and then when they're in the grocery store and five hours down they hear someone
[00:36:09] talking about selling a house so like oh my gosh Rachel I got to run down and tell her you know what I
[00:36:13] mean and so that works really well the other thing you guys are going to do and this is to help you
[00:36:17] turn a new follower into a client so what happens a lot of times is like say that I have a post in my
[00:36:24] husband and I go to Tahoe right and we have our anniversary when you do a birthday anniversary post
[00:36:29] you get tons of people and a happy anniversary happy birthday and everybody is like usually people
[00:36:33] do one blanket thank you like thank you for all the love in the messages right what what I want you
[00:36:39] to do is like when I tell my agents we're going to lead generate for two hours on social media what
[00:36:43] you're doing is you're setting a two hour block and you're going to go to a higher producing post
[00:36:48] that you have now your comments you should respond to all your comments because the point of social
[00:36:52] media is to have interactions so just as a given if you people are commenting on your social
[00:36:57] comment back to them but then missing link this like magic piece that people don't realize are your
[00:37:02] likes your likes are literally this list of people going hey I'm watching I'm right here I see what
[00:37:07] you're doing but it's usually a vanity metric people like I got a hundred likes on that post look
[00:37:11] at it yeah it makes us feel good because we're like people like us but those people get no
[00:37:16] interactions so what I do when I'm doing lead generation for social media is I go on my computer I
[00:37:22] don't do it on my cell phone because I need to be able to like click on my with my mouse and stuff
[00:37:25] so I go on my computer I click on the likes I scroll over the likes I copy them and I paste them into
[00:37:31] a word doc and then you guys I go one by one I literally go through and what I would do is when
[00:37:36] so so say that Jessica comments on my post and she's like happy anniversary I'm like thanks girl we
[00:37:40] had a great time and then DJ likes my post what I'm going to do is I'm going to go proactively to DJ's
[00:37:46] page so he likes my post I go look at his social I see something happening in this world um
[00:37:52] what's what's something that just happened for you and your family recently like a mile I just
[00:37:56] went to the US open for tennis a couple weeks ago okay perfect so he likes my post for my
[00:38:03] anniversary I would send him a private message I'd be like hey DJ thanks so much for connecting
[00:38:07] with me on my anniversary post we had the best time in Tahoe oh my gosh I saw you guys just
[00:38:11] wanted the US open that's always been a bucket list for me how was it so we're now we're talking
[00:38:22] I mentioned something super specific about DJ I don't say anything about the fact that he's in
[00:38:27] Chicago right yeah I don't say anything about Chicago because it has nothing to do with what we're
[00:38:33] talking about and I'm gonna ask him about the US open and then he's gonna come back and you say oh my
[00:38:37] gosh I saw Hayden like just started teaving that's so crazy like I hope you guys are getting
[00:38:41] sleep and we're gonna go back and forth back and forth just talking personal life eventually when I
[00:38:46] think the transition feels good and natural maybe it's same day maybe it's same week maybe it's
[00:38:50] a month whenever it feels natural keyword here I say something to DJ the effect of hey DJ I really
[00:38:56] love getting to know you on a personal level which makes me think we'd probably align in our
[00:38:59] business lives as well I don't have a great referral partner in Chicago do you have one in northern
[00:39:03] California you guys 131 referrals this is how this conversation happens because I want to lead
[00:39:11] with the relationship I always want to get to know the person first and then we talk about the
[00:39:16] business and and it works it works really really well and we're predominantly talking Instagram
[00:39:22] right now I'm guessing right because or I guess Facebook I'm sorry Facebook too I still get most
[00:39:27] of my business comes from Facebook still I'm Facebook I see well I'm just thinking of like I'm
[00:39:32] thinking of a Facebook real so so let's get really specific so you have a Facebook page where
[00:39:37] you're posting your reels that's public anyone can access that when somebody on Facebook likes it
[00:39:43] do you you do have to be friends with them then to go back and message or you can well you could
[00:39:49] message without you can message them about being friends yeah you cuz I'm kept I only have
[00:39:54] five thousand followers on Facebook and I have like 20 that I don't know what I have now but like
[00:39:58] I kept a long time ago so for me so you're not saying friend them necessarily you're saying
[00:40:02] send them a direct message you don't have the friend or if you have the availability but I just
[00:40:06] send them a private message got you yeah and then again this is where it is really important to have
[00:40:12] that public profile because if you have a private profile and I go to say something to you I can't
[00:40:17] see what anything happening in your life and the other thing too is like with social media it can
[00:40:21] be this like beautiful empowering positive place it can also suck the life out of you so you have
[00:40:26] to be really intentional so like if I'm going through and I go to click on someone's page and I get
[00:40:30] that like oh I would never be friends with this person in real life right there and then I block
[00:40:34] them I'm out because I'm like I you get to choose who you have in your feed who you have in your life
[00:40:39] same thing on social I want my social media to make me feel good and inspire me and empower me
[00:40:45] and if it makes me feel the opposite those people don't belong in my world anymore I love that
[00:40:50] yeah boundaries it's about boundaries that's really great um so okay let's let's go back through those
[00:40:55] steps so before you do your real you are going to find people that have uh that you are that you
[00:41:02] are not seeing their content they are not seeing seeing your five minutes before reals will stress
[00:41:07] people out I feel like it's just a post when I'm doing my lead generation I'm not doing it on
[00:41:12] reels I'm doing it on posts so I'm doing it like a picture post that I've made um I could do it for
[00:41:18] reels but when I'm doing my lead generation it's post and you have to remember most of our audience
[00:41:21] probably are doing more posts than reels so so do it with a post guys like how many how many posts
[00:41:28] versus reels would you recommend on a daily weekly basis the great question um I think you need to
[00:41:35] be doing at least one real week at least one real week if not more um I think you should be
[00:41:40] posting at least three times a week now you could do um just a picture post you could do a carousel
[00:41:47] post which is multiple pictures um so you can choose what that looks like but you do want to make
[00:41:52] sure you're doing the the reels and can I share with them that get social leverage what that is
[00:41:57] yes okay so a lot of REALTORS come to me and they're like Rachel I want to do video but I don't know
[00:42:03] I don't know what to do I don't know how to record it I don't know what equipment I need I don't
[00:42:07] know you know all the things so I really felt this question coming up a lot to me and it was
[00:42:11] stressing a lot of people out so I said how can I fill that void for our industry so I created
[00:42:15] something called the weekly real system so we have hundreds of agents doing this around the country
[00:42:20] and what we do is every week I find a trending real and real estate I shoot the raw footage
[00:42:26] then on Monday you get an email that comes to you and it says hey your real is ready to create
[00:42:31] all you have to do is you go on this private website that we have and it will say like for example
[00:42:35] it will say film yourself smiling and typing on your camera for seven seconds you send that into
[00:42:41] my team then we're going to edit it for you put the captions the hook I will write the hook for you
[00:42:46] put it on the screen I write the actual post for you I give you your hashtags your geo hashtags
[00:42:52] and I find the trending audio that's trending that week in real estate um and through Instagram and
[00:42:57] so literally it's all done for you it's 97 bucks a month so it's super inexpensive you get a
[00:43:03] real every single week and what's super cool is it is your fastest conversion that you will see
[00:43:07] for your platform because we have people that are doing it and like one of our girls she posted a
[00:43:12] real and she got four leads from it another one her daughter was in preschool and her all the
[00:43:18] said in her real came into her preschool teachers algorithm and she was like I need to sell my house
[00:43:22] I had no idea you were in real estate um we have people whose social media is up I get I get messages
[00:43:27] all the time 415 percent 445 percent for engagement like this is the fastest thing you can do to build
[00:43:35] your presence on social media and we can handle the entire things for you um if you go to get social
[00:43:40] leverage and you click on the weekly reels it's 97 bucks a month and it's like a no-brainer
[00:43:45] I love that and you you guys are doing all the heavy lifting all we're doing is doing a quick
[00:43:50] little shot of us you guys do the editing and then we just post it uh and do you recommend a post
[00:43:57] do you what about cross posting what do we think about now maybe that's sort of a little bit
[00:44:02] further ahead for a lot of our listeners but phase two would be considering dropping those
[00:44:07] into TikTok I guess YouTube shorts things like that do you do cross post again different
[00:44:12] channels yeah so when I make a reel I post it on Facebook Instagram YouTube shorts in TikTok
[00:44:18] I don't a TikTok is literally just there because I post on it I don't do anything through TikTok
[00:44:22] I don't I've never got a referral through TikTok I just do it to like get the overall
[00:44:26] yeah why not yeah um and really I don't post it my assistant post it for me there um but
[00:44:31] Facebook and Instagram is my jam that's like where my main focus comes from I have a YouTube
[00:44:35] channel my YouTube channel has like hours hours of free coaching content you guys are welcome to
[00:44:39] go binge it um we talk about like how I got in the luxury market I just shared my whole open house
[00:44:45] because we had a 1.7 million dollar buyer walk into our open house and I had them converted
[00:44:49] and in contract uh seven days later um and so I give my whole open house system I believe in our
[00:44:55] industry and just like sharing and giving and it always comes back around and so that's why I do
[00:45:01] all these different things for free because it's like why not people did it for me yeah and and it
[00:45:07] and it does people uh get hooked on content and then you have this ability to market to them forever
[00:45:12] and that's the beauty of uh you know creating really great content um let's talk about your
[00:45:18] coaching as well okay so yeah I have so a lot of people are like Rachel I I feel like you're my
[00:45:24] style I love the ideas you're doing I would like more so um two things one I have a mastermind group
[00:45:31] it's 29 bucks a month um that one if you go to Rachel's coaching crew um sorry I forgot to tell
[00:45:37] you about that one but it's 29 bucks a month and I go in there twice a month and I coach for 45
[00:45:41] minutes this last week we talked all about um listings I went over my listing presentation with them
[00:45:48] I've talked about how I broke into the luxury market when you hire your first admin hey I did this
[00:45:53] Instagram post and I got no traction so it's really cool because I go in I coach for 40
[00:45:57] of minutes but there's also Q&A so um we've have 81 referrals already passed out in that group uh
[00:46:03] it's you have a membership library you can watch all the coaching later so literally for
[00:46:07] $126 a month you could have your weekly real covered and you can be in a coaching mastermind group
[00:46:13] game changer um the other thing is if you really want to do a deep dive on social if you're like you
[00:46:17] know what 2024 is the year that I'm really gonna focus on social media at a high level um I have an
[00:46:22] eight week social media masterclass where I do deep dives in the Facebook Instagram and YouTube um
[00:46:28] and I teach you like what to post how to post when to post um how to beat the algorithm I give you a
[00:46:34] content calendar it really just kind of helps you get some insight into like really if you're doing
[00:46:39] social media at a high level and it's a place you're gonna focus on for lead generation um it helps
[00:46:44] I love it I think we have covered so much let's recap let's recap some of the different offerings

All right, Rachel, excited to have you. Thank you. I'm stoked to be here. Send you guys all the vibes from Northern California. Well, that's what Californians are good at vibes. That's what we don't, you know, I'm in the Midwest. We don't that word. We don't even know how to interpret that word here. But we do love California vibes. Of course, everyone does. Let's start before we get into all the cool social stuff. And by the way, the stuff I'm, when Rachel starts telling her story about the success she's been having and her team's been having with social, you are absolutely going to want to hear this. It's shocking. And I've been doing this for six years. And I've had countless people on here who have social strategies. Rachel strategy is really, really awesome. So hang tight for that. But Rachel, let's start at the beginning. How did you get into real estate? Oh, let's go back. OK, so I got real estate in 2012. So my grandma was a REALTOR. My dad was a broker for 42 years. And I always said I would never, ever go into real estate. By the way, everybody who has parents that are in real estate say the exact same thing. And my boss, same thing. But go ahead. Honestly, though, I feel like the reason was because no one talked about work, like balance back then. Like my dad, I had an awesome childhood, but my dad would like mist, or sometimes because he was doing showing some stuff like that. And I just was like, I never want to have that. You know? And I found myself in 2012 working at a real estate office. And I was unlicensed. And I was in a really unhealthy marriage at that point in my life. My ex-husband was 80% disabled, but 50% was PTSD for the Marine Corps. So I spent my days at the office like, you're going to get your offer accepted. You got this. And I got my, spent my nights like crying myself to sleep, because I was just a really direct spot. And I knew I wanted my life to change, but I didn't know what that looked like. And I remember seeing all these paychecks coming through the REALTORS. And I was like, gosh, there's so much more money than I was making. But I was making $15 that I could count on every, you know? And so it was like, OK, stability versus instability. The thing I'd never done is like bet on myself. So I decided that I would do an accelerated program. I got my license in 90 days. And I jumped into real estate. When I jumped into real estate, I want to state was with both feet. Because literally my first year, DJ, I'm knocking 200 doors a week and doing three open houses every week. So knocking 200 doors, doing three open houses. And I didn't sell any homes for the first four months. So I got the rejection you face and the amount of like, but also the grit you get. And like what I always said, people like, how do you keep doing that? Like that's four months with nothing. And I was like, my why? Like why I was doing this was bigger than any excuse that I could come up with. Like I had to change my life. So I didn't sell any homes for the first four months, but I ended up selling 39 homes that first year. And then 100. Hold on, hold on. I want to pause for dramatic effect. We're going to do what's called a pregnant pause. 39 homes in your first year with really not a, I'm assuming not a tremendous influence or no, I'd never even looked at a listing presentation by a presentation. Because like I, I was in all different industries before that I was like a small yay to talk people how to do food and wine pairing. Like I did, you know, was in restaurants. Like I didn't do the real estate stuff. And so it took me some time to get traction going. But what I did during those those first four months and really that first year, like I wrote my listing presentation 100 times for 100 days every day for 100 days. I mastered script practice like I, I wanted to overcome every objection. So when it came I wasn't nervous. So if I didn't have the clients, I pretended that I did. So I was like a really a student of the game. So I sold 39 homes for first year, then 109 the next year, and then 123. So three years in I hit Wall Street Journal's top 1000 agents in the country. We still have that today. And I, you know, I really, I wanted to, I wanted to make an impact on my community. I wanted to be in a healthy marriage. I wanted to have kids. I wanted to be a mom like all these things were important to me. And so I knew that like I love doing the door knocking me up in houses. The thing is you can have one conversation with one person at a time. So the belly to belly is really important. But I also wanted like more. And so I decided I would really start to like focus on social media because if I did social media, I would choose when I respond to people. I choose when I post like I could make a business model around social media. And I never heard of anyone doing that. And I'm a systems girl. That's the only way I can survive having a four year old, a year and nine month old and a nine month old. So I have to have systems in my world. And so I created a business model around social media. And like the first year we had 17 referrals come in. Then it was like 30 than 50. But last year we had 131 referrals come through social. And that's through Facebook, Instagram and YouTube. So life looks very different now. I'm a real estate coach. I love love teaching people how to build their businesses. I travel the country speaking. I travel with my family. So whenever I'm in a conference, I bring my littles and my nanny and my husband and it's wild. But it's really fun. If you're wondering if you're noticing that Rachel speaks quickly, that's because she has to, because she has three little ones to attend to and four businesses to run. But guys, how great is this, this Rachel? And I don't, I'm not saying to speak slowly more slowly. I just love the fact that you got a lot to do. Incapable of it. And I'm told hanging out with me is like taking a shot of espresso so good morning everybody. I know I love it. I love it. I'm kind of the same way I have to remind myself to just load on. But everything you're saying is so gold. Gold and I want you to get as much in as possible through this episode. So let's talk about social media. You know what I'd like to maybe start with is what do most agents not understand about social media? Or what are they go wrong? That's a great question. So I think the thing with most REALTORS, I'll try to slow it down all of that because I get really excited. No, no, no, do not slow it down. You're perfect. I just love how fast you talk. Oh, you're good. So I think one of the biggest mistakes REALTORS make is they make their social media all about them and all about real estate. And they think that like, if look at this house, they just sold, look at my new listing. Look at this award. I got look at me. Look at me. And what you don't realize is that people might find you because you're in real estate, but they stick around because of who you are and how you make them feel. So you know, one of the biggest mistakes REALTORS make is just talking about real estate. So when I'm talking to people with social, I say you need to make your social media like an 80, 20 principle. 80% of what you post is actually going to be you. Who you are, what you're doing, what you're reading, what you're eating, you know, like why what makes you tick, why somebody would hang out with you on the weekend. And 20% is only going to be real estate. 20% is real estate. But you know what you could do? You could be watching or listening to this podcast right now, take all these notes. And then you're going to have the business model by the end of this for how to build a business through social media. Then you, as a REALTOR, go on your social media and you make a post and say, you know, it was just hanging out with DJ Paris and he interviewed a top 1000 agent in the country about how she got 131 referrals last year. I would love to share those notes with you. If you want to copy my notes, leave your email below. You, as a REALTOR, if you can be the person who's always adding value to others, when they need to buy a sell or they have a referral for your location, they're going to think of you. So what I do in my world is I think, okay, how can every single day when I woke up, I was like, how can I add value to others? How can I add value to others? My clients and my community. So like being the local experts. So it's October, right? So I'm sharing where to look at the local pump-compatients. I love it. If it's a matter, right? I'm doing a pie giveaway. If it's December, I'm sharing, you know, where to see the local Christmas tree like locations. Like you can google this stuff for free, then go on Canva, get a free account, and make it look a graphic. And the thing is, if you're always adding value to people, then your platform becomes a place they want to hang out. And, you know, the algorithm is like this weird tricky place, but the simplest way to think of the algorithm, because you hear that word thrown a lot around a lot, it is, it is your impact and your influence you have on social media. It's like whatever you're looking at, the goal of Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, Snapchat, all of them. The goal is to keep you on the platform as long as possible. So if you're looking at a specific niche, they're going to give you more of that to keep you on it. The trick is how you as a REALTOR, the person that they want to be in front of. And that's what my model goes through. Yeah, it's no, you just said so much there. And I want to go back to some of the non real estate stuff, like community focused stuff. So this I feel is one of the biggest missed opportunities for REALTORS. Because if we think about like, if you're whatever you're into, maybe, you know, you're a mom with little ones. So you could create content specific to mothers who are working, maybe you have children, and you could do stuff about, hey, I have some resources for moms who are trying to do it all. It could be totally unrelated to real estate or it could be, hey, here's some really cool events that are going on in our area for moms with little kids or here's some, you know, mom meetups or it could be, here's what's going on for Labor Day. If you don't have plans, do that. I, this, now we're talking about value and we, and what you said is so important is you have to think, what do my, you know, look, when somebody's ready to buy or sell a home, yes, they want some of that real estate content. But in between five to seven years of them not buying or selling a home, you probably don't care that much about you selling doing a listing. I mean, it's cool. It's good, but we want to, you want to get them hooked on your content is what I'm hearing from you. Yes. Absolutely. Yeah, you really want to, so with social media, you're either doing of one of two things. You're either educating people or you're entertaining. You're either educating or entertaining. And if you're really doing social media high level, you do it a balance of both. And I think people get so caught up because they're like, I don't even know what to post about. No one cares about the fact that like my, you know, I sit in my office, my dog at my feet. Yes, they freaking do. Oh, they love it. Right. And so like when I, if you're going to build a business through social media, I want you to write down one through five. You're literally done one, two, three, four, five. Number one, you're going to write down real estate because that's the industry that we're all in. But then two through five, you're going to make it personal to you. What makes you tick? If you were in an elevator and someone said, okay, tell me about yourself. What are some things you like? That's your five things. That's the other four. So like real, for me, I do real estate and being an entrepreneur. I talk about being a wife and a mom because that's my number one, right? I talk about personal growth because I'm always on a journey to be like the best version of myself. I talk about positive body image because it's something that I struggle with. And after having three kids and the last one being an emergency C section, like my, my body has changed a lot. And I had fertility and we've had four losses. And like I've really had this like journey to become a mom. And you know, it is something I talk about. I wasn't going to talk about it on social media. But I found myself like silently struggling. And I was like, man, I have a super killer support system and I'm struggling. Yeah, imagine what everyone else who doesn't have that support. And by the way, what percentage of women struggle with, what percentage of humans, but certainly women, I mean, this is 99% of women struggle with body image because of how we as a society project, what women are supposed to look like. And obviously it's very, we all know how tough women have it. So that's a great, great thing to talk about. Yeah. And I just think like, you know, and it can, the cool thing too is your four passions can change before I had kids. That was not something I talked about. But after I had kids like positive body image became one of my focal points of my life. So it's something that I want to talk about with others. And so you come up with these different things that help you define who you are as a person. And then remember, people will find you because you're in real estate. But they stick around because of who you are and how you make them feel. And so you get really intentional on going through these. And like if you go on my Instagram and you look at like the grid, right, like the little pictures, you'll literally see me go through these topics. And you know, if, if you join my real estate team today, you actually have to sign a social media addendum that says you'll post at least three times a week, three times a week. Wow, it's part, it's part of the agreement to work with you. I love it. Oh, absolutely. Because if you're not doing social media as a REALTOR now, you're going to get left behind. And you know, one of the big things that we really are focusing on now is video. Yeah, you know, you know, it's funny. I want to pause for a second because I wanted to get your take on this. I'm curious to get, I have an opinion about this, but I'll wait to hear your opinion first. Although maybe I'll be leading leading you on this one. I'll try not to. What do you think the role of websites, personal websites are going to be going forward? Are they going to be less important, more important, neutral, meaning an agent with their own website? Yeah, I think that your web, you need to have a website because it can be linked to your MLS, right, for IDX. So like you can first search portals and if you're doing at and stuff like that. But otherwise your social media is your website. Yes, yes. Stop working on your websites, everybody. First of all, you're, and your SEO, you're not going to compete with the other people who are already locked in those SEO results for top, you know, two, one to three searches on, or one to three positions on the search of Google. Anything under one to three, no one clicks on it anyway. So don't try to play that game because, again, have a nice looking website. Like you said, have an IDX search built in so people can search instead of going to Zillow or Redfin. They're going to maybe use your site. But realize that not going to hang out on your website. One thing that I want you to look at. So go, you can do it right now. It's too sorry. And that's a real one. I was just doing this morning. Okay, so if you go to my Instagram right now, so you go to Rachel Adamsley, what you're going to see is like the first line. So you want to be really intentional. So this is like a class for you guys on editing your bios. You want when somebody goes to your social media, you want it to within one second, they know exactly what they're looking at. So first, your profile has to be public. You cannot build a social media presence with a private profile. Because if you click on my page and I'm private, then you accept you add for me to be your friend or whatever follow by the time that I accept you, you've forgotten who I am because you've done 15 things that day. So what the very first line you see is Rachel Adamsley, top 1000 REALTOR in business coach. The next thing you see is social media experts. So my credibility, right? And where I serve California REALTORS, you've got to say your REALTOR on your social media. And you have to say the area you serve. Because if you want referrals, so think about this, I had 131 referrals come through last year. A huge portion of those are agents around the country. The rest are client and community, right? But you want to make sure that you always say the area that you serve, because then it gives people to know where they can give you referrals. And they're constantly moving coming to your profile and getting value and laughing and connecting and feeling and cue your there, buddy. And then by the way, you happen to serve that area. And then you continue moving on. And so the third line down is really where I do credibility. So you can say how many houses you sold or if you haven't, if you don't have the credibility behind you yet, you know, you're with the top brokerage, like whatever you want to say there. And then my fourth line down is my personal steps. I'm a wife and a working mama with three boys. And then the line after that is a call to action. So if you, your call to action could be like, click here to find out how your much your home is worth. But you always want to have something for them to do. You'll notice like if you go on my social media, and let's talk about Reels for a minute. Let's talk about video because it is the number one thing the algorithm favors above all else right now. I spent a lot of time working on Reels and doing video. And we have something we can talk about a little bit for you guys that will help. And what you'll notice is if you go look at the Reels and you click on them and you literally go over just to look at the Reels, you're going to see what is called a hook. So what people don't realize is when people, someone's scrolling on social, you actually only have two seconds, two freaking seconds to stop the scroll and see if what you're posting about is something they want. So your hook that, so what you do is when you create your video, you have the hook on the screen literally for two seconds. When you use editing apps, like I use one called InShot, you can keep it on there for two seconds and then you move forward. So like one says how I gain 6,000 followers in three months. Another one says how I got a $1.7 million buyer from an open house. Check out my system. How to hack the algorithm. Best recording equipment for your videos to go viral. How to lose 10 pounds with Chad GPT. Like these are hooks. These are things that literally are going to stop people and they're going to say, oh, I want to learn about that. But if I don't have an eye catching something on there, then they scroll past so many ReelTers. Like one of the big mistakes they do, DJ, is they'll be like, hey guys, my name's Rachel and today gone. Lost him. Who cares? My name is. What am I going to talk about? That's what you have to have the second. I want to make two quick points that I'd for clarifying. So when she's talking about a hook, what we're really thinking about is when we're scrolling on YouTube. So let's think about YouTube for a second. The videos that tend to perform the best have sort of title cards. So what we're really talking about with Rachel saying is we're creating sort of title cards within a reel. So the first, so that way when they're when they're listed, as you she was saying to scroll through, you literally without even having to click on the video, you can see exactly what the video is. That is huge. And I believe Rachel, you may have to correct me on this. I believe once you upload a reel into Instagram, I don't believe you can edit or add a cover after the fact. I made me wrong. Yes. So I've made this mistake a million times or I've uploaded Reels. They don't have a title card or the first two seconds that show what we're going to be with written out. And you're right. Nobody knows what it is. Yeah. Yeah. So you you really need to have that done ahead of time. And the title card, like he's saying, so the cover page, like that is important for when that's important for when you are like creating a reel for your page and someone's scrolling on your content. But if they're not on your page and you get to the explore page where I'm at a lot, that's where you need to have the two for the the hook on there for the two seconds. Because that's where you're going to grab them. Now quick, quick question. So I've got about, I don't know, maybe 50 Reels for this podcast where you grab little we just started grabbing moments and doing 60 second videos. Yeah, we did not think about title cards. So would it make sense to pull all of those down add title cards, re upload them as as new posts just because it would probably get more visibility or. Is it moving forward? No, because that's like deleting all your social media and starting fresh. It's like when's the best time to plan to tree? Right. Right. Plant the seed now. Yeah. Yeah, yesterday I can't so do it today. So you just start moving forward. So your next title card will be here. And you just again, you want to pull the hooks. And I have what I can do for your listeners actually. I have a website that I'll give you where if you go to I think it's called Rachel's freebies. Yeah, go to Rachel's freebies.com. That will give them 20 free hooks. So it will give them 20. So they can use right now on their social media, which you guys can put that in the show notes. But if you go to Rachel's freebies, that'll give them 20 hooks they can use right now on their social media. I also wanted to make one point. This is just a little aside that I noticed when I was searching for you on Instagram. And I want everybody not don't just go directly to Rachel's Instagram. Go to Google, search Rachel Adams Lee Instagram. And I want you to notice the font that comes up on Google when it shows the result. It is a unique font because Rachel was very smart. And realize that when you use a unique font on Instagram, it actually pulls that into the Google snippet when people are search on Google. And it is so unique. It drew my eye immediately to it. I was like, whoa, did Google change their fonts all of a sudden? No, just for Rachel because when you go to her Instagram page, you will see her name is in a unique font that is not by accident. That is not a mistake. That is notice how your eyes go straight to that. That's a little tiny thing I noticed. And it's a little fancy font. If you guys it's a free app, you can download it. It's called a fancy font. And so like whenever I'm writing emails, whenever, like when I do captions on social media, I use a lot. If I want you to see something, I capitalize it and I bold it because I wanted to grab your attention because it grabs mine. And I'm going a million miles a minute. So like I have to have stuff that's like, stop. This is important. Read this. Either way, you know the story you and I talked about before we went live about how. So I was telling him about how I got a phone call today from someone who is going through a divorce and she was saying she needs to find a REALTOR. And she said she was talking to her daughter at the gym about how she needs a REALTOR. And her 17 year old daughter was like, I follow this girl on Instagram. Why don't you call her? She found me because of a real you guys. The reals are the number one thing that algorithm favors and it will push you above other people in the feed. And so but the reason I brought it up as well, we're talking my phone rang and it was the attorney and some like, oh, it's so hard. Because I'm like, can I just pause this so I can go get that piece of business? Nope. I'm time blocked. This is the one thing I will tell you that makes you sick guys time blocking. Like my number one focus right now is doing this podcast with DJ because I committed to it. I'm time blocked for it as soon as I'm done with him. I'm going to call back that attorney and I'm going to post a real that I was editing right before I got on here. So like my whole life is time blocked. But you can do you can build this business. You can have the kids. You can do the things you want to do if you time block. When I did the door knocking the open houses, I time blocked for it. I would I would doork two hours a day and I could hit about 75 doors in those two hours with social media. I'll give you guys a system for how you can lead generate through social media for two hours. All my lead generation is in two hours because that's like as long as my attention span can last before I'm like, oh, it's not good. But you know, that's that's a success. If you can master time blocking as a REALTOR, like you can do this. Yeah, and it's we're talking about turn the phone off or put it face down and don't because things are going to be flying at you as we all know. Things fly at you all day long and it's easy. I'm if you're like me, you just get distracted by any shiny object. So good idea. Now, so let's talk about content again. So we understand the the importance of of reals and what a real is at least on an Instagram. I believe is 90 seconds the max. I can't remember 60 or 90. Yeah, so short form video. It can be 90 seconds or less, but I'll be totally transparent with you like the easiest reels that go trending and viral are like 10 seconds or less. And even seven seconds because what you do. So a real will play twice in a row for someone who's watching it. It's called looping. It will play twice in a row for someone that's watching it. And so what you do is the way you want to think about reels. Like that the strategy behind it is in this kind of consent a little overwhelming, but I'll give you something at the end that will make it easy. So you're going to record your video. Okay. And you're going to come up with your topic. You're going to know what you're going to do. So you're going to record your video for let's like my best ones are like seven seconds long. No joke. So seven seconds long. You're you literally can record you typing at a computer and smiling for seven seconds. Then you're going to come up with your hook. So whatever the video is going to be about. And you're going to put it on the top of the screen for two seconds. Then you're going to have two more things you're going to share with them. And then you can be like see caption. What I will tell you is the real is two is to entertain them. Where you educate them and you position yourself as the expert is in the caption below. Because what you're going to notice on all of my reels like I have one that I put up earlier this week. And it talks about I think I was like at 60,000 views like as of this morning. And it talks it talks about how things that depreciate and value as soon as you buy them. And I just said your car. Your designer purse. Osayi Bulls like I made it kind of funny. And then I was like things that don't real estate. And it is a five second video you guys all I'm doing is walking towards a camera for five seconds. And then in the caption I educate. And I'm like let's talk about why real estate is important to build wealth. And so I position myself as the expert in the caption. But in that I'm using 30 hashtags six or geo hashtags. So people are like the hashtags matter. They do matter. They're not going to make or break your content. But they do help. And if you can get more followers why the heck not. So hashtags I want to think of hashtags like Google. So if someone's looking for a REALTOR like a top luxury REALTOR they could type in luxury and thousands hundreds of thousands of REALTORS have used that hashtag. But if it's like Sacramento, luxury real estate Sacramento there's going to be a lot fewer that are going to pop up and my reals are good so they're going to grab them. So with hashtags like the video like the system I would say for a video is like you're going to record it. You're going to edit it and I use in shot like I said you're going to put your words on the screen. I do want you to put words on the screen because 80% of people are watching your videos without the sound on because they're watching them at work when they should be working. So you want to make sure you tell them what it's going to be about on the screen. And then also this is like super heady but like the algorithm it's called alternative text and keywords. They're watching the words you put on the screen and that is going to be fed to the people out there that are looking in your genre. And then trending audio is the other piece. So the trending audio makes a massive difference on your real and you just look for that little arrow in the bottom left screen that's going up and that is how you find the trending audio. And let's explain what trending audio is. Okay so trending audio is the music that you hear on a reel that has a certain amount of uses that is catching into the algorithm so it's going to push it out in front of more people. So I only post reels with trending audio because I know the system and how to make it go have a better chance of going viral and getting in front of more people. But again I'm targeting REALTORS because I want referrals from REALTORS around the country and I'm targeting buyers and sellers in my local community because I want them to position me as a local expert. And do your reels are they ever more than let's say 10 seconds or so or are they usually within that seven second? They are. So like when I'm educating when I'm teaching about something, they're a little bit longer. I have one that I was like not sure how it would do because it's like I think it was like 84 seconds or something but I was teaching people about this rule that I call the 555 which is how you wake up the algorithm when you make a post so they get more eyes on your content. So I was teaching them about it says like how to hack the algorithm and get more eyes on your content. That's my hook. And then I'm teaching them an idea about the rule of 555. And so that is definitely a little bit of a longer one. And I want and you also you test it out because my audience is different than your audience. So what works for me that the short reels where you entertain them and educate work for everybody. But like my audience knows that I'm going to teach them how to build a business as well. So like I'm going to educate if you don't do that you might do one where you say why it's important to get a home inspection. Like and that's your hook right why it's important to get a home inspection. And then or like three mistakes every buyer makes when not getting a home inspection too not getting approved for a loan like you know what I mean. And then you educate them below anyone can do that. Question about hashtags. So you said something that struck me as as interesting because I have heard I've heard a lot of different opinions on on hashtagging. So I have heard that Instagram prefers keeping the number of hashtags under six. You use 30. So can you speak a little bit to and I know you've tested it all. So is that sort of an old wives tale that only keep a few hashtags per person. So the algorithm is always changing always changing. The most you can have is 30. The least you could have is one but you don't get penalized for having 30. So I use it. I again I'm a systems person. I'm not like what are the number six that I need to do screw that I have 30. My six are in there pick the six you want. You know what I mean. Like I don't you're not getting you don't get like you don't get hurt for having more hashtags. Got it because I know at some point in social media there was like what we would call like keyword stuffing and people would just you know inflate but I guess the point is Instagram doesn't really care how many how many hashtags you have if the content is keeping people engaged for that amount of time that they're watching they don't care. And if you have crappy content and you just can't have all these keywords in hashtags then yeah maybe they would downvote that but you're absolutely right it's all about the quality of the content. Yeah for sure. Okay go ahead. Do you want to talk about so one thing I can we can talk about is how they can convert a follower into a client because I think that's a really important conversation. Huge. Okay so you're going to have all these people following you and what you don't realize is right now only seven to 10 percent of your friends are seeing what you're doing seven to 10 percent of your friends. By the way at best it might it might even be like three percent yeah. Yeah like think about all the people you have in your on your social media but you see the same stories the same post the same feed and the rule is if you're not seeing them they're not seeing you. So every single month all my social media clients what we do is we take pen to paper and we write down 25 names of people that were already friends with on social but we're not seeing their content anymore. So you could pick your 25 it could be 25 local business owners it could be 25 realtorch from around the country it could be 25 past clients it could be 25 people from your church but each month you're going to pick 25 people and then this is the way that you get in front of the people who you're already friends with but they're not seeing your content. So it's called my rule of 555. So five minutes before you make a post you comment on five people's post a comment of five words or more. Okay let's let's go on a backup. So here's what we're talking about. I just want to make sure this is really clear because this is absolutely an idea that not one person has ever shared and the six years and 500 episodes we've done this. So here's what here's what Rachel is saying. So she's saying one thing to know is that very few a very small percentage of your followers on social are actually going to see your posts organically under 10% for sure. So how do we get in front of that additional 90 plus percent what she does is before she oh well well we first start out is the other thing she said was one way to sort of see who might be seeing your stuff and who might not is it's this one-to-one relationship. If you are seeing their reels their posts odds are they are probably seeing yours as well but since we know most aren't you can take a look and you can make an assumption that if you're not seeing theirs they're not seeing yours you're going to make a list of those people and then five minutes before you actually post you are go ahead. Yeah so five minutes before you make a post you comment on five of those people's posts a comment of five words or more and then what that does so they're there are people who like you who love you who actually want to refer business to you but you're not top of mind for them right like and so the way you stay top of mind is being in front of them and then once they start to engage with your stuff you're in there and you're not talking about real estate so they're not like oh my god shut up they're like wow she's doing this with her kids oh she went on this vacation she read this book she's going through this with her body like and they start to have things in common with me and then they're like oh and then when they're in the grocery store and five hours down they hear someone talking about selling a house so like oh my gosh Rachel I got to run down and tell her you know what I mean and so that works really well the other thing you guys are going to do and this is to help you turn a new follower into a client so what happens a lot of times is like say that I have a post in my husband and I go to Tahoe right and we have our anniversary when you do a birthday anniversary post you get tons of people and a happy anniversary happy birthday and everybody is like usually people do one blanket thank you like thank you for all the love in the messages right what what I want you to do is like when I tell my agents we're going to lead generate for two hours on social media what you're doing is you're setting a two hour block and you're going to go to a higher producing post that you have now your comments you should respond to all your comments because the point of social media is to have interactions so just as a given if you people are commenting on your social comment back to them but then missing link this like magic piece that people don't realize are your likes your likes are literally this list of people going hey I'm watching I'm right here I see what you're doing but it's usually a vanity metric people like I got a hundred likes on that post look at it yeah it makes us feel good because we're like people like us but those people get no interactions so what I do when I'm doing lead generation for social media is I go on my computer I don't do it on my cell phone because I need to be able to like click on my with my mouse and stuff so I go on my computer I click on the likes I scroll over the likes I copy them and I paste them into a word doc and then you guys I go one by one I literally go through and what I would do is when so so say that Jessica comments on my post and she's like happy anniversary I'm like thanks girl we had a great time and then DJ likes my post what I'm going to do is I'm going to go proactively to DJ's page so he likes my post I go look at his social I see something happening in this world um what's what's something that just happened for you and your family recently like a mile I just went to the US open for tennis a couple weeks ago okay perfect so he likes my post for my anniversary I would send him a private message I'd be like hey DJ thanks so much for connecting with me on my anniversary post we had the best time in Tahoe oh my gosh I saw you guys just wanted the US open that's always been a bucket list for me how was it so we're now we're talking I mentioned something super specific about DJ I don't say anything about the fact that he's in Chicago right yeah I don't say anything about Chicago because it has nothing to do with what we're talking about and I'm gonna ask him about the US open and then he's gonna come back and you say oh my gosh I saw Hayden like just started teaving that's so crazy like I hope you guys are getting sleep and we're gonna go back and forth back and forth just talking personal life eventually when I think the transition feels good and natural maybe it's same day maybe it's same week maybe it's a month whenever it feels natural keyword here I say something to DJ the effect of hey DJ I really love getting to know you on a personal level which makes me think we'd probably align in our business lives as well I don't have a great referral partner in Chicago do you have one in northern California you guys 131 referrals this is how this conversation happens because I want to lead with the relationship I always want to get to know the person first and then we talk about the business and and it works it works really really well and we're predominantly talking Instagram right now I'm guessing right because or I guess Facebook I'm sorry Facebook too I still get most of my business comes from Facebook still I'm Facebook I see well I'm just thinking of like I'm thinking of a Facebook real so so let's get really specific so you have a Facebook page where you're posting your reels that's public anyone can access that when somebody on Facebook likes it do you you do have to be friends with them then to go back and message or you can well you could message without you can message them about being friends yeah you cuz I'm kept I only have five thousand followers on Facebook and I have like 20 that I don't know what I have now but like I kept a long time ago so for me so you're not saying friend them necessarily you're saying send them a direct message you don't have the friend or if you have the availability but I just send them a private message got you yeah and then again this is where it is really important to have that public profile because if you have a private profile and I go to say something to you I can't see what anything happening in your life and the other thing too is like with social media it can be this like beautiful empowering positive place it can also suck the life out of you so you have to be really intentional so like if I'm going through and I go to click on someone's page and I get that like oh I would never be friends with this person in real life right there and then I block them I'm out because I'm like I you get to choose who you have in your feed who you have in your life same thing on social I want my social media to make me feel good and inspire me and empower me and if it makes me feel the opposite those people don't belong in my world anymore I love that yeah boundaries it's about boundaries that's really great um so okay let's let's go back through those steps so before you do your real you are going to find people that have uh that you are that you are not seeing their content they are not seeing seeing your five minutes before reals will stress people out I feel like it's just a post when I'm doing my lead generation I'm not doing it on reels I'm doing it on posts so I'm doing it like a picture post that I've made um I could do it for reels but when I'm doing my lead generation it's post and you have to remember most of our audience probably are doing more posts than reels so so do it with a post guys like how many how many posts versus reels would you recommend on a daily weekly basis the great question um I think you need to be doing at least one real week at least one real week if not more um I think you should be posting at least three times a week now you could do um just a picture post you could do a carousel post which is multiple pictures um so you can choose what that looks like but you do want to make sure you're doing the the reels and can I share with them that get social leverage what that is yes okay so a lot of REALTORS come to me and they're like Rachel I want to do video but I don't know I don't know what to do I don't know how to record it I don't know what equipment I need I don't know you know all the things so I really felt this question coming up a lot to me and it was stressing a lot of people out so I said how can I fill that void for our industry so I created something called the weekly real system so we have hundreds of agents doing this around the country and what we do is every week I find a trending real and real estate I shoot the raw footage then on Monday you get an email that comes to you and it says hey your real is ready to create all you have to do is you go on this private website that we have and it will say like for example it will say film yourself smiling and typing on your camera for seven seconds you send that into my team then we're going to edit it for you put the captions the hook I will write the hook for you put it on the screen I write the actual post for you I give you your hashtags your geo hashtags and I find the trending audio that's trending that week in real estate um and through Instagram and so literally it's all done for you it's 97 bucks a month so it's super inexpensive you get a real every single week and what's super cool is it is your fastest conversion that you will see for your platform because we have people that are doing it and like one of our girls she posted a real and she got four leads from it another one her daughter was in preschool and her all the said in her real came into her preschool teachers algorithm and she was like I need to sell my house I had no idea you were in real estate um we have people whose social media is up I get I get messages all the time 415 percent 445 percent for engagement like this is the fastest thing you can do to build your presence on social media and we can handle the entire things for you um if you go to get social leverage and you click on the weekly reels it's 97 bucks a month and it's like a no-brainer I love that and you you guys are doing all the heavy lifting all we're doing is doing a quick little shot of us you guys do the editing and then we just post it uh and do you recommend a post do you what about cross posting what do we think about now maybe that's sort of a little bit further ahead for a lot of our listeners but phase two would be considering dropping those into TikTok I guess YouTube shorts things like that do you do cross post again different channels yeah so when I make a reel I post it on Facebook Instagram YouTube shorts in TikTok I don't a TikTok is literally just there because I post on it I don't do anything through TikTok I don't I've never got a referral through TikTok I just do it to like get the overall yeah why not yeah um and really I don't post it my assistant post it for me there um but Facebook and Instagram is my jam that's like where my main focus comes from I have a YouTube channel my YouTube channel has like hours hours of free coaching content you guys are welcome to go binge it um we talk about like how I got in the luxury market I just shared my whole open house because we had a 1.7 million dollar buyer walk into our open house and I had them converted and in contract uh seven days later um and so I give my whole open house system I believe in our industry and just like sharing and giving and it always comes back around and so that's why I do all these different things for free because it's like why not people did it for me yeah and and it and it does people uh get hooked on content and then you have this ability to market to them forever and that's the beauty of uh you know creating really great content um let's talk about your coaching as well okay so yeah I have so a lot of people are like Rachel I I feel like you're my style I love the ideas you're doing I would like more so um two things one I have a mastermind group it's 29 bucks a month um that one if you go to Rachel's coaching crew um sorry I forgot to tell you about that one but it's 29 bucks a month and I go in there twice a month and I coach for 45 minutes this last week we talked all about um listings I went over my listing presentation with them I've talked about how I broke into the luxury market when you hire your first admin hey I did this Instagram post and I got no traction so it's really cool because I go in I coach for 40 of minutes but there's also Q&A so um we've have 81 referrals already passed out in that group uh it's you have a membership library you can watch all the coaching later so literally for $126 a month you could have your weekly real covered and you can be in a coaching mastermind group game changer um the other thing is if you really want to do a deep dive on social if you're like you know what 2024 is the year that I'm really gonna focus on social media at a high level um I have an eight week social media masterclass where I do deep dives in the Facebook Instagram and YouTube um and I teach you like what to post how to post when to post um how to beat the algorithm I give you a content calendar it really just kind of helps you get some insight into like really if you're doing social media at a high level and it's a place you're gonna focus on for lead generation um it helps I love it I think we have covered so much let's recap let's recap some of the different offerings because you're giving away a lot of great content to our audience so let's uh what was the
