[00:01:16] Today's episode is brought to you by corded.io.
[00:01:20] Are you looking for agents to join your brokerage or team?
[00:01:23] Now, as a real estate recruiter, I can tell you the answer is always yes.
[00:01:28] But most agents aren't looking to move right now.
[00:01:31] So how do you know who to contact?
[00:01:33] Well, what if I were to tell you there's a recruiting and retention tool powered by
[00:01:37] artificial intelligence that shows you exactly which agents in your local market are looking
[00:01:42] to leave their brokerage right now and which agents at your own firm are also looking
[00:01:48] to leave you?
[00:01:49] Now, I've been recruiting REALTORS for 15 years and I've hired over 2000 agents.
[00:01:54] I can tell you with no exaggeration, this is the tool I've been waiting for.
[00:01:58] Corded's AI looks for trends across dozens of variables for each agent in your market
[00:02:03] and shows you which agents they believe are likely to move.
[00:02:06] Not only does it do that, but corded's AI went and visited my recruiting website and
[00:02:11] read everything I offer.
[00:02:13] So now when I'm recruiting, corded's AI tells me exactly what to say based on that
[00:02:18] agent's needs and what my brokerage can offer.
[00:02:21] It even writes emails for me.
[00:02:23] I've never seen anything like it and I use it every single day.
[00:02:27] Now, if you are looking to grow your brokerage, corded.io is the best tool out there.
[00:02:32] Visit corded.io to schedule a demo again.
[00:02:35] That's corded.io.
[00:02:37] And now, onto the show.
[00:02:54] Hello, hello, good to be your real listeners.
[00:02:56] I'm really excited to be back with you.
[00:02:57] My name is Kim Rittberg and today we're going to be talking about when you should use
[00:03:00] AI and when you should not use AI.
[00:03:03] If you've never joined before, my name is Kim Rittberg.
[00:03:06] I'm an award-winning video marketer.
[00:03:08] I was a media executive at Netflix.
[00:03:10] I launched the video unit for us weekly.
[00:03:12] Now, I'm a video coach for real estate agents.
[00:03:15] I really, really love empowering you with knowledge that you can make more money and build
[00:03:20] the life that you deserve.
[00:03:22] We're talking now about AI and obviously everyone's talking about AI and everyone's making
[00:03:27] content with AI.
[00:03:28] I've spoken about this at the Fast Company Innovation Festival.
[00:03:31] I talk about this in some of my real estate keynotes as well.
[00:03:35] Here's a couple things to be thinking about as you're considering using AI for your videos.
[00:03:40] The reason why this is coming up and I'm feeling very strongly about sharing it with you
[00:03:44] is because when we're on social media, it's important to think about why am I on social
[00:03:50] media.
[00:03:51] By the way, before I keep going, I have this program called Video Bootcamp, a live coaching
[00:03:56] program.
[00:03:57] I have a few spots left for the October cohort.
[00:04:00] I only run this twice a year.
[00:04:01] Twice a year.
[00:04:02] It's a small live group coaching program.
[00:04:03] If you're serious about making videos that bring in leads and clients, make sure to message
[00:04:07] me.
[00:04:08] I'm at KimRitberg.com or KimRitberg on Instagram, Facebook, YouTube, KimRitberg content.
[00:04:14] When we're talking about AI and thinking about should I be making content with AI, step
[00:04:20] back and say, what are my goals with social media?
[00:04:23] They are to connect with people.
[00:04:24] They are to bring in leads.
[00:04:26] They are to bring in clients.
[00:04:27] They are to build my visibility and my credibility.
[00:04:29] So when we consider when should we use AI, think about, is this advancing my goals?
[00:04:35] Can this piece of technology at this exact moment help?
[00:04:39] The reason I'm being so specific like that is because I'm seeing people create these
[00:04:43] avatars, video AI avatars of yourself.
[00:04:48] I've been asked, should I use it?
[00:04:50] What do you think?
[00:04:51] I think if it advances your goal of being credible and building relationships and building
[00:04:56] leads, then you should consider using it.
[00:04:58] When the avatar is so robotic and kind of bad and the video doesn't look good and doesn't
[00:05:03] sound like you, that does not help your goal, right?
[00:05:06] Because the goal is to build relationships through social media.
[00:05:10] So instead of doing coffee meetings with a Jillian people, you can post videos and engage
[00:05:14] with them online.
[00:05:16] So the whole idea is to advance that.
[00:05:20] And if your video is instead of advancing it, it's killing it.
[00:05:22] That's not a good way to use it.
[00:05:24] So I would say start testing out the different technology that you want.
[00:05:29] See what you should use it for.
[00:05:31] So once you train, let's say a video avatar, I would say the things that you could be
[00:05:34] using it for are the things that you don't need your personality as much, like a market
[00:05:39] update or neighborhood happenings or things like that.
[00:05:43] What I wouldn't do is I wouldn't have it replace you in a video that's more personal,
[00:05:47] right?
[00:05:47] Where you're sharing your point of view on something or you're bringing people into your
[00:05:51] life of your family and balancing being a parent and a REALTOR or a little bit of off
[00:05:56] the clock stuff.
[00:05:57] So it's just important to really think about the point of social media and does that
[00:06:01] video advance it.
[00:06:03] So now I'm also going to give you a couple of tips on using chat GBT or AI or other AI
[00:06:08] functionality to create content.
[00:06:11] So obviously coming up with ideas, AI is amazing.
[00:06:15] It is such an incredible help.
[00:06:17] So I am very bullish on that.
[00:06:19] I think you should be using AI to come up with more ideas faster.
[00:06:23] The very important step before that though is to understand who you are.
[00:06:27] You are not just a real estate agent from X City or X Suburb.
[00:06:30] You are a specific type of person who talks a specific type of way who has these sort
[00:06:36] of interests who is niched down into this area.
[00:06:40] So I really want you to remember your, you need to tell AI that about you because if
[00:06:46] you don't, it's going to give you the same things that they're going to give every
[00:06:49] similar other person.
[00:06:50] And part of the beauty of social media part of why you're on it is showing people what's
[00:06:55] special about you.
[00:06:56] So if you're creating the same thing as everyone else, you're not really doing that.
[00:06:59] All right.
[00:07:00] So here is a little acronym about using AI, SAG, SAG.
[00:07:05] When you get content out of AI, I want you to run it through this list.
[00:07:10] S, does it sound like me?
[00:07:12] A, do I agree with it?
[00:07:16] G is a generic.
[00:07:17] So S does it sound like me?
[00:07:19] Whether it's video or it's written content that AI is giving you, it has to sound like
[00:07:23] you, if it doesn't sound like you do not use that.
[00:07:25] Right?
[00:07:25] It has to sound how you talk.
[00:07:27] It has to be in your voice.
[00:07:29] You can either just edit it manually or ask it to write in a different tone so you could
[00:07:33] say, write this in a more breezy way.
[00:07:36] Right?
[00:07:36] I speak in a more professional tone or I'm funny than this.
[00:07:40] Agree.
[00:07:41] Do you agree with it?
[00:07:43] Because, hey, I can give you a whole lot of stuff.
[00:07:45] But you only want to put out there the things you actually agree with.
[00:07:49] Right?
[00:07:49] So just keep that in mind.
[00:07:51] And I don't just mean like, good bad.
[00:07:53] I agree with this or I don't agree with this.
[00:07:54] But you have your own opinion about buying, selling, your market, your neighborhood.
[00:07:58] So think about that.
[00:08:00] Generic.
[00:08:01] Generic is bad.
[00:08:03] Specific is terrific.
[00:08:05] So generic is everybody in the world can create the same slop from AI.
[00:08:08] You want things that sound like only you, John, only you, Jane, can make and produce and
[00:08:14] put out there.
[00:08:15] Because only, John, only Jane, you are going to represent that fire or that seller.
[00:08:21] So when we step back to what I said in the beginning of this recording, I've got goals.
[00:08:26] Think about what is your goal from this content.
[00:08:29] If it's generic and anyone can post it and it doesn't matter if it's you, and that's
[00:08:34] not really driving to your goals.
[00:08:36] So it's very, very important to keep top of mind.
[00:08:37] I say this a lot.
[00:08:38] And if you want to listen to my other Keeping It Real episodes, that would be great.
[00:08:42] Credibility and connection.
[00:08:43] Those are the two C's that are super important to be working on as a real estate agent.
[00:08:47] Credibility.
[00:08:48] Make people trust you.
[00:08:49] Make them see you as an expert.
[00:08:51] Connection.
[00:08:52] Make them like you.
[00:08:53] Make them relate to you, right?
[00:08:54] They have to see you as this credible, relatable person.
[00:08:58] Super duper important.
[00:09:00] And so it's just, it's very important to just keep those in mind.
[00:09:04] There's so much amazing technology.
[00:09:05] It helps us create more content.
[00:09:07] But it's important to create better content, not just more content, better content.
[00:09:13] Awesome.
[00:09:13] So I don't want to overwhelm.
[00:09:15] I feel like when we talk about AI, it can feel like so much like this, than this, than
[00:09:18] this.
[00:09:18] But I want you all to keep in mind as you're testing out new technologies, new new technologies
[00:09:22] come out all the time.
[00:09:23] I want you to think about does this advance my business goals and apply the SAG?
[00:09:28] Does it sound like me?
[00:09:29] Do I agree with it?
[00:09:30] Is it generic?
[00:09:31] If it doesn't, then it will sag.
[00:09:34] And if it does, it will soar.
[00:09:37] So that is what to think about when you're analyzing and saying should I use this.
[00:09:40] So I am Kim Ritberg.

[00:09:53] And again, I have video book camp.
[00:09:54] It is my live coaching program that helps agents get buyers and sellers to love them and
[00:10:00] work with them.
[00:10:00] It's really, really fun.
[00:10:02] And so thank you so much.
[00:10:03] Don't forget, hiding from the camera is hiding from clients.
[00:10:05] So get on camera.
[00:10:06] And I will talk to you soon.
[00:10:08] Until next time.
