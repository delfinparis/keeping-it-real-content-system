[00:02:45] Chris, welcome once again to keeping it real or excited to have you.
[00:02:48] DJ, thanks for having me back.
[00:02:50] Always a pleasure looking forward digging into it today.
[00:02:53] Always a pleasure to so I wanted to start with with something that I get a a Zillow report every every every month as a consumer just because I'm always interested in what Zillow sends to the public.
[00:03:06] That is my address and they tell me you know what they believe my home to be worth.
[00:03:10] And you know, it's a pretty depressing number I saw today.
[00:03:13] It's actually gone down in the last 30 days quite substantially.
[00:03:16] However, I am not in the market of selling, but I was thinking about sellers because I also have a very low interest rate.
[00:03:25] So I'm about around a 3% rate.
[00:03:27] And so if I were to sell right now, which again, I'm not looking to do, I would be, you know, I would feel at least at first glance that I'm getting a pretty bad deal because my home is, you know,
[00:03:39] worth less than what I paid for it.
[00:03:40] And I am still net equity positive, but not by a whole lot.
[00:03:46] And then also I would be giving up that 3% rate to, you know, most likely a 6% plus rate in the new home that I were to purchase.
[00:03:55] So I was just thinking this has got to be on the minds of a lot of homeowners right now who probably would like to buy, but maybe are seeing those rates and maybe seeing their value of their home, you know, go down in the last couple years.
[00:04:10] As those rates have gone up.
[00:04:12] So just kind of curious to get your thoughts on the psychology of the consumer or the homeowner and what REALTORS can do in 2023 to sort of adjust for that.
[00:04:23] Yeah, it's a great question because we are reaching an interesting kind of crossroads as far as the overall consumer mindset and set of experiences that are driving their behavior.
[00:04:39] Right.
[00:04:40] I think it's fair to say there have been, I would say three recent, relatively recent, honestly, relatively recent sets of kind of eras for buyers and sellers of real estate in the United States.
[00:04:56] Right. We had the pre-COVID era when we had a relatively short inventory relative to demand, but they weren't writing stories in the Washington post about.
[00:05:09] Inventory then COVID came and everybody kind of freaked out and we needed to kind of get our heads around what that meant and the real estate effects that happened were.
[00:05:24] You know, a lot of folks decided they were going to move from cities out to more suburban or rural areas.
[00:05:30] We saw a very high demand for housing turnover, especially for single family homes.
[00:05:36] And we also had an economy that warranted the need of kind of some kickstart programs to give us a chance to make sure that we could continue to function economically as a country.
[00:05:52] Whether or not those were necessary or viable solutions, I'm going to leave that up to somebody else to debate.
[00:05:56] But one of the kind of downstream results of that were extraordinarily low interest rates.
[00:06:02] As you mentioned before, for purchasers of real estate in the COVID or the very, you know, like the current COVID or the very post COVID time.
[00:06:17] So then that leads us to where we are now interest rates high inventory still a bit of a challenge in a lot of places still competitive markets in a lot of places.
[00:06:30] And real estate professionals looking to be planning their strategies for 2023.
[00:06:36] And a lot of questions are being asked about how do we reach sellers.
[00:06:39] We've got sellers who are unlikely to want to sell their home because where are they going to go?
[00:06:46] They don't have a lot of great inventory options. They don't have a lot of great interest rate options.
[00:06:50] What's the benefit to sell?
[00:06:53] And I want to put forward a couple of different ideas here.
[00:06:57] The first is you talked about what's the psychology and the mindset of sellers.
[00:07:01] I want to start by setting the tone in that we have to remember the psychology and mindset of sellers is not a single point of light.
[00:07:12] It is a significant gradation of various perspectives and viewpoints.
[00:07:19] We have to remember that yes, a lot of real estate was purchased in the COVID and immediately post COVID.
[00:07:28] If you can call it that era at low interest rates, but that does not make up the majority of home ownership right now by any stretch of the imagination.
[00:07:37] We have a good chunk of folks who owned their home long before COVID was even a thing have an incredible amount of equity in their home right now that is likely unrealized.
[00:07:52] We have a good chunk of folks who didn't refinance who are sitting on even post refinance are still sitting on a good chunk of equity.
[00:08:02] And where we find ourselves as real estate professionals is a place we haven't found ourselves in a long time, which is the number one priority for a lot of real estate professionals when it comes to listings and sellers and their psychology and mindset is one of education.
[00:08:22] Not of immediate opportunity.
[00:08:25] We are not answering calls from people saying, hey, I heard it's a great time to sell my house. Well, options do I have real estate professionals should consider those calls to be on hold for quite a while, maybe a year, maybe two years, frankly, we are needing to now shift our strategies to education and awareness because a lot of owners right now, either don't know their options or
[00:08:52] think they know their options when they don't really, which is frankly worse. So to answer your your mindset question, my initial response is most mindsets right now are either unaware or ignorant and these are places where yes, it makes things challenging.
[00:09:10] But for real estate professionals who can shift their strategies, that's a huge opportunity to
[00:09:16] It's such a it's such an interesting play this equity question. I think this is something that isn't typically, although I'm just thinking of myself and I might not be representative of the John Q public because I'm in the real estate business. So I probably look, I'm probably not the right sort of viewpoint here, but this idea of thinking about equity.
[00:09:38] I just don't think most homeowners are think about their equity, unless they're in the process of selling right I think it's they look at the appreciation.
[00:09:49] They look at the the amount they cut to the mortgage bank, the lender every month, they probably know their interest rate or their abouts. So I think those are kind of the three key metrics is what's my home worth.
[00:10:02] What am I paying every month? What's my what's my actual rates? I don't know and what what my home is even worth I think is oftentimes not really thought about all that much.
[00:10:14] But I think this idea of equity would be a real so I think that's our really interesting idea is like maybe being maybe I'm thinking about from an agent perspective. What would what do you think about an agent doing an evaluation.
[00:10:27] Not just what's your home worth because of course we can do automate those through CMAs and there's there's a million tools to do that. But what if an agent in 2023 said, hey, I know you might not be thinking of selling right now, but you did buy like seven years ago.
[00:10:43] And you've probably refinanced I'm sure you have a really low rate now, but let's take a look at the equity and see if that would actually influence your decision in being able to move. Maybe that even trumps.
[00:10:56] The interest rate that's currently out there because we can look at equity. We can look at pricing now has come down. So I'm just curious what you think of having that conversation with a home owner.
[00:11:08] I don't think anyone really has those conversations outside of real estate. Like I don't even think of financial advisor necessarily would say let's talk about the equity in your home.
[00:11:17] Because I think typically financial advisors don't look at that as asset until you actually cash it out. So yeah, go ahead. I'm sorry.
[00:11:26] No, no, that was my point was I think this is kind of an interesting opportunity for agents who really want to separate themselves is almost doing like a financial review of the home as opposed to just do you sell do you want a bigger place. Do you?
[00:11:40] Yeah, 100% in fact, this is actually it's funny you mentioned this because this was one of the topics I talked about last couple of weeks ago, a couple of weeks via when we're recording this.
[00:11:53] I was a presenter at the triple play conference in Atlantic City for New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania REALTORS.
[00:11:59] And one of the things I chatted about in one of my sessions there was I challenged folks a challenge real estate professionals who attended there to answer the following question.
[00:12:12] When you are representing a buyer in the purchase of real estate, when you finish at the closing table and the last signature is at the bottom of the final page.
[00:12:24] Your clients do they automatically magically somehow supernaturally get in doubt with the expertise and knowledge necessary to understand not just what they've purchased but the value of their home as an investment.
[00:12:44] The answer of course is no signing closing paperwork does not give you the insight to understand the value of your investment and I keep saying investment even if you're just buying a single family home to live in and to raise your kids in.
[00:12:59] You and I were talking earlier before we started recording this real estate is one of those unique purchases that as an investment it doesn't matter whether you're buying this as income producing or not.
[00:13:11] When you purchase real estate you're making an investment and it can turn out good or it could turn out bad you get to be in control of that and your control is significantly more fine tuned when you're aware of the ins and outs of your investment.
[00:13:28] So what I challenged folks to do what I challenged folks to do at triple play was to remember when somebody buys a home.
[00:13:38] They do not automatically become a real estate expert and an expert in terms of their homes value in the market their homes value in terms of the equity that they've collected and their homes value in terms of how competitive it could be for other home options.
[00:13:59] And so I challenged REALTORS there to set a schedule to become their buyers pro bono real estate financial advisor every year set a meeting where you offer to say hey I'd love to do an analysis of your investment let's find out how much it's worth let's find out how much equity you have in it let's find out how competitive your rates are I don't need to charge you for this I don't want to charge you for this.
[00:14:29] I only want to arm you with the information you need to make good decisions about your home those folks are going to not just become your client they're going to become your client for life by offering those services and for all those real estate professionals who are listening to this and say well I don't have this big buyer client pool to to draw from you have an unlimited set of people to draw from because there are millions tens of millions of homeowners in this
[00:14:59] country who's selling agent they are no longer in contract with who need and deserve this information and who you could start offering it to and by de facto become their agent so start reaching out to folks offer this financial analysis offer it completely free say I just want to arm you with the information that you need to make a good decision about your home these folks are going to become your client
[00:15:29] by virtue of offering this service and when it is time to sell and when you can demonstrate that they have a strategic advantage they're going to sell with you because you are the one that clearly is demonstrating that you know the mark of
[00:15:42] Yeah, this is a consultant perspective and I like the idea of not mentioning when when you're reaching out to two owners and they and again they don't have to be past clients they can be really anyone who owns a property and
[00:15:57] this idea of not saying hey I want to run a CMA I want to run comps for you which again there are lots of homeowners that understand that term or have heard that term before
[00:16:07] but the term they probably haven't heard is I want to evaluate your investment and this idea of it being now they hear that from their financial advisor's if they have one once a year usually
[00:16:17] they'll say hey we need to read you know look at the investments see how they did it stacked up against the the indexes or your overall you know financial goals
[00:16:25] and let's make sure we're on track to retire or whatever the you know send the kids to college or whatever it might be
[00:16:31] This is a very interesting alternative a way to to really do a CMA but not just a CMA so you're saying you know yeah
[00:16:38] they can get a CMA for anybody comps are pretty easy you can even just get them online without talking to a REALTOR
[00:16:44] but this is more of a what a financial advisor would do they'd sit down and say let's let's go over all the numbers
[00:16:49] not about all their other investments like a financial advisor would do but about just their home and thinking of it like an investment because
[00:16:56] while you were doing that while you were talking I was thinking what I did when I was ready to buy the property that I have now
[00:17:03] I was very nervous because it's obviously it was sizable purchase anyone who buys a home understands the nervousness there and
[00:17:09] everyone listening knows what it's like for their clients and I called a bunch of top REALTOR is in my area about five of them just to go am I making a mistake here
[00:17:19] because I was nervous and I wanted to get their advice and I reached out to people that I knew and said is this a good idea because it was new construction
[00:17:27] I was a little nervous as this overpriced and and I got really good advice that way and so I did a version of that by talking to other REALTORS
[00:17:35] most people aren't going to do that but I guess the point was I wanted somebody to tell me it's a good time to buy yes
[00:17:41] I give it my stamp of approval and I don't know that I would always
[00:17:47] I think that that's something that a lot of people want to know is I totally great and I don't know that they always trust the REALTOR to give them that information
[00:17:58] I think REALTORS are often seen as salespeople and salespeople are trying to sell and so whether or not
[00:18:07] the real estate agent has the best interest of the client at mind I think there there does have to be a little bit of
[00:18:14] change work around the language that's used when you call like I want to talk about your home as an investment and I want to talk about
[00:18:20] where that investment sits right now so that you can think about the future and think about if there's any plans that will change
[00:18:27] as a result of you really understanding where things are I mean I just think that's a powerful reframe
[00:18:34] and and a really really like unique approach well you know the interesting thing too is that the reef the the other
[00:18:41] kind of extension of this reframing the conversation gets into the way that our clients define their relationship with us so if I ask you
[00:18:54] you know if I ask you if I say I was new to Chicago and I said DJ I'd really need some suggestions I need a good doctor I need a dentist I need an accountant I need a chiropractor
[00:19:07] the people that you would refer to me or refer me to you would say oh yeah you should definitely check out my chiropractor
[00:19:15] it's just you know down on the down on this straight oh yeah you need an accountant my accountant I've been working working with him for years
[00:19:21] great guy you you'd love this guy oh you need a doctor the doctor I haven't gone to she's great uh you know
[00:19:28] a bunch of my family we all see her you just those those referrals totally natural language
[00:19:35] every single one of them was a you got to see my doctor my chiropractor my dentist for a car account or whatever
[00:19:44] but what it comes to real estate professionals when you say oh I'm looking to move to Chicago
[00:19:49] and I need a good real estate professional you would probably I mean I think the default for most folks is
[00:19:56] I know I know a great REALTOR yeah or I know a bunch of REALTORS yeah or I've I've you know I've worked with three different
[00:20:03] REALTORS in town I can give you all of their names if you want but I know a REALTOR in town or I know
[00:20:10] a ton of REALTORS or there are a ton of REALTORS we don't have this my professional relationship in
[00:20:17] the real estate space but that comes from the fact that you see your chiropractor on a regular basis
[00:20:25] you see your accountant on a regular basis you see your doctor we see our real estate professional once
[00:20:30] in a blue moon because our relationship is completely transaction oriented with those people it's
[00:20:37] not care and keeping oriented what you can adjust in 2023 not to make our chiropractor pun here
[00:20:44] but what you can adjust in 2023 is the way that you pursue that relationship with folks to say
[00:20:51] listen I want to be your REALTOR or your broker your agent so here's how we can do this and you
[00:21:01] know you can start by fostering these relationships with people you already are connected to but that
[00:21:06] doesn't have to be the case this is you know you start further back you know closer to zero if
[00:21:12] you're going you know you know it trying to prospect with people who you don't have a current
[00:21:16] relationship with but imagine just for a second the this value let's say you say you know I'd
[00:21:23] love to help you understand the value of your home help you understand when it's a great time to buy
[00:21:28] and sell somebody says yeah sure that'd be great you can pull somebody anybody you can you can
[00:21:35] request from your bank a mortgage statement these are on demand if you have an online portal you
[00:21:40] can get it instantly it will tell you all the details how much your loan was for what your
[00:21:47] current balance is what your equity is and what your rate is now as a savvy real estate professional
[00:21:55] I can also tell you banks don't typically do home equity loans if you have less than 20% equity
[00:22:03] but if you have more than 20% equity a bank will often lend you money against your equity so
[00:22:10] if you sit down with me and you say okay through our analysis I can see that you you have
[00:22:17] $200,000 left on your mortgage you have about $150,000 in equity on this property so you could
[00:22:25] qualify for refinance you could pull some of this equity out and do a project in the house you
[00:22:30] want a brand new kitchen this would pay for it you could sell right now if you sold right now even
[00:22:36] after fees you'd still be walking away with somewhere in the neighborhood of $120,000, $15,000 in your
[00:22:44] pocket what could we do with that people are going to look at you providing this value and options as
[00:22:53] all the evidence that they need that you have their best interest at heart and not yours it is no
[00:22:59] longer a transactional relationship it is a nurturing recurring value relationship just like those
[00:23:06] other professionals that I named earlier this is really a chance to set the tone for how you want
[00:23:11] to operate your business in 2023 I know a lot of REALTORS are nervous about this frankly this is
[00:23:17] an opportunity this is the time to put your foot on the gas not get back on your heels it's time
[00:23:22] to get on your toes yeah and I think I think your boy you just said so many things that I couldn't
[00:23:28] agree more with I think this is the opportunity to develop that annual you know touch that's not
[00:23:35] just a hey it's your birthday it's the holidays thanks for you know this is your home anniversary
[00:23:39] card for when you bought or sold all those things good too but this idea of actually providing real
[00:23:45] value once a year and the real value that I think the average homeowner is thinking about is or
[00:23:52] the average the question that they're thinking about is should I buy or sell right now should I move
[00:23:57] should I move right now I think is usually the main question and you know there's obviously pressures
[00:24:03] that you know with job changes and there's reasons that people move that I'm nothing to do with
[00:24:07] an annual review from from a REALTOR but boy I would love a service like that I would pay for a
[00:24:15] service like that I pay up a hundred or two hundred bucks a year for somebody to come in and say okay
[00:24:21] I looked at every I mean I pay a financial advisor I pay an account and I pay you know I would
[00:24:25] actually pay so this is something that you can do that's very valuable that I think people would
[00:24:31] pay for I don't know that you should charge people for it and maybe in some states you probably
[00:24:35] could charge but regardless I think it's it's you're right this is the value ad that is going to
[00:24:39] ensure that two things one that they're going to work with you in the future but two and this goes
[00:24:45] back to your hey you got to talk to my hair stylist or my account this this is going to get people
[00:24:53] talking I think and I think you could even tell them that when you're when you're doing these reviews
[00:24:59] is say hey you know this is something I do it's just my way of providing service but if you have
[00:25:04] other friends that are thinking should I buy should I sell is it a good time rates are up or
[00:25:09] inventory stuff I would love to do the same analysis for them and you could you know I think this
[00:25:14] could be a huge marketing strategy for people big time big time and you know let's like call a spade
[00:25:20] here too this is advantageous to real estate professionals not just in the fact that you have
[00:25:27] the opportunity to create more stable repeat business which is certainly a huge upside but
[00:25:34] let's also not discount the fact that if you can get this sort of relationship locked in you then
[00:25:43] they have a platform to give the sort of advice that includes things like hey you know how like
[00:25:50] yeah there are 12 there's 12 months in the year but if you decide that you're going to make one
[00:25:57] extra payment a month you can cut down on your interest costs over the course of you know X number
[00:26:04] of years and increase your equity by X percentage over X number of years this is really great for you
[00:26:12] this sounds like good advice it is good advice to homeowners but the other thing it does is you are
[00:26:18] setting yourself up to have a distant and near future clients who are more qualified who have
[00:26:27] higher budgets who are more educated about real estate and the process I mean imagine the difference
[00:26:34] between a listing where your seller not only do they know the real market value of their home
[00:26:42] before the listing appointment because you've already educated them on this but they also are
[00:26:48] realistic about what the next steps in tail your workload goes from 100 to five in that instant
[00:26:56] now granted you're doing that work on the front end but you're establishing it's kind of it has a
[00:27:02] slow drip of education and awareness in a way that other you know professionals have to kind of
[00:27:09] mainline all at once I have the front end sellers feel overwhelmed they're often miss the details
[00:27:15] that are necessary to take those shortcuts I mean this is a selfish strategy too you're going to
[00:27:21] develop regular bit a book of business from this strategy but you're also going to develop
[00:27:27] more qualified better informed and frankly clients with bigger budgets as a result which is
[00:27:33] going to affect positively our bottom lines as well I want to pause for a moment to talk about our
[00:27:40] episode sponsor are one of my favorite companies out there follow up boss now after interviewing

[00:28:55] and now back to our episode yeah it's really it's really interesting it's funny I've done 430
[00:29:02] whatever episodes of this podcast where I've interviewed a lot of the very top producers in the
[00:29:09] country and I don't know that anyone's ever shared with me this idea of doing an annual people
[00:29:15] talk about doing an annual review but they haven't really got is granular about it as what you've
[00:29:20] mentioned and so if we were just to recap these steps so the idea is you would call people that are
[00:29:25] either past clients or you could say hey I'm trying I'm you could even tell people that weren't your
[00:29:31] past client and maybe you could even test it with people who might never use you but people who
[00:29:37] you could sort of try this approach with and say hey I'm I really want to bring more value to my
[00:29:41] clients next this upcoming year and I have found that my clients are constantly wondering what's
[00:29:47] going on in the market is it a good time for me to move should I sell should I buy and you know
[00:29:53] oftentimes they're not totally sure how to make sense of that answer and so I want to come in and
[00:29:58] just kind of evaluate what what you know your current position your current home your investment
[00:30:05] how it's doing how it's doing relative to other homes in the area and if you were thinking about
[00:30:10] moving you know here's here's kind of what you might be looking at so we can we're going to take a
[00:30:14] look at the full financial picture of that and give you a give you a recommendation yeah I think I
[00:30:20] gosh I think that's I mean you know look if I've ever been to an attorney the end of the damn
[00:30:25] like what's the recommend should I do this or not you know or an accountant should I declare this
[00:30:29] or not like I just want people's advice and I think the the REALTORS really should move away as far
[00:30:37] as they can from being labeled a salesperson as to a service professional or consultants I know
[00:30:45] consultants and you have to check with your state licensing to make sure that you can call yourself
[00:30:51] other things you definitely don't want to call yourself something that you're not supposed to
[00:30:54] but this idea of acting as if you are a consultant whether or not you use that word acting as if
[00:31:01] you would hire somebody to comment and say how do I fix my business and they go well I just
[00:31:05] looked at everything here's what you need to do well you know I'm going to give you the one this is
[00:31:10] the kind of a kind of a a dollop of Chris secret sauce to get this conversation started with
[00:31:16] people who you don't know you're like cold approaching on this here's the line and I guarantee it
[00:31:21] works because I've used it many times so if you're listening to this and I've used this on you
[00:31:27] sorry but here it is when you are cold approaching somebody you say I was just doing a CMA for a
[00:31:34] neighbor of yours and I used your property as a marker for value for the neighborhood I wanted to
[00:31:42] reach out to let you to let you know that I was just looking at values there I have a very good
[00:31:48] understanding of what your home is worth and would love to know if you're interested in this
[00:31:53] overall financial picture no obligation no cost I've already got the work done these are all the
[00:32:00] key phrases that's a great one I've already got the work done allows people to say yes without
[00:32:06] feeling like they're inconveniencing you or putting themselves in your debt that's a reason a lot
[00:32:12] of people say no to free things because they're like oh then I'm going to owe this person something
[00:32:16] say I've already got the work done then they have are free to say yes without the feeling of true
[00:32:21] or implied obligation say I was doing a CMA for a neighbor of yours this shows that you are active
[00:32:29] that you have experience that other people trust you these are true key phrases that are going to
[00:32:37] activate those parts in our brain we're like okay there is real value that I'm recognizing here
[00:32:42] I'm not being sold a gimmick I've got somebody who's providing real value in places that I trust
[00:32:49] in ways that I don't feel obligated I can say yes to this you're going to get in the doors if
[00:32:54] you use these lines I promise yeah you could even say something like I know this seems like a sales
[00:33:00] tactic but the reality of it is actually did this for your for your neighbor and I just already
[00:33:04] have the data done so I'm happy to share it with you yeah what's in it for me is maybe down the road
[00:33:09] maybe you would think about me if you ever needed to find a professional but but what I wanted to
[00:33:13] share with you is actually just something I did for your neighbor anyway you probably wouldn't
[00:33:18] even have to say it that way but the point is as you could you could explain it and and be
[00:33:22] totally forthright about it and still likely get very little resistance so this is a great great
[00:33:27] place to wrap up so I really want one everyone to think about 2023 and I know there's a lot of
[00:33:33] nervous energy in the agent world I know our agents are scared I know our broker owners are
[00:33:40] are have some fear about 2023 and what we're trying to find is opportunities that can keep you focused
[00:33:47] and active and this idea of doing annual reviews and not just what's your home worth and what's
[00:33:53] you know what what are the homes near you worth but actually looking at equity looking at rates
[00:33:57] looking at refri looking at all of all of the things that people don't usually look at in one
[00:34:04] overarching sort of view right they look at little things like hope the rates that
[00:34:08] and my home is worth this over here and it's it's not really a cohesive picture
[00:34:14] and you could provide that picture to them and you could even if you really wanted to get
[00:34:18] granular just one other idea as you could talk to their financial advisor too you could say hey if
[00:34:23] you have and by the way it's another great person in network with because of course those
[00:34:28] opportunities are pretty obvious but you could even say hey I want to run this by your financial
[00:34:31] advisor and just make sure I get their sign off on it which then if they like their financial
[00:34:36] advisor and maybe you're not their current REALTOR provide some social proof where they might
[00:34:40] consider using you in the future so you can even go that further step is saying hey I want to talk
[00:34:45] to your your financial advisor about this if you're not you know so anyway but Chris let's talk
[00:34:50] about the clothes in the last minute and then we'll we'll let you go so tell us for anyone that

DJ, thanks for having me back. Always a pleasure looking forward digging into it today. Always a pleasure to so I wanted to start with with something that I get a a Zillow report every every every month as a consumer just because I'm always interested in what Zillow sends to the public. That is my address and they tell me you know what they believe my home to be worth. And you know, it's a pretty depressing number I saw today. It's actually gone down in the last 30 days quite substantially. However, I am not in the market of selling, but I was thinking about sellers because I also have a very low interest rate. So I'm about around a 3% rate. And so if I were to sell right now, which again, I'm not looking to do, I would be, you know, I would feel at least at first glance that I'm getting a pretty bad deal because my home is, you know, worth less than what I paid for it. And I am still net equity positive, but not by a whole lot. And then also I would be giving up that 3% rate to, you know, most likely a 6% plus rate in the new home that I were to purchase. So I was just thinking this has got to be on the minds of a lot of homeowners right now who probably would like to buy, but maybe are seeing those rates and maybe seeing their value of their home, you know, go down in the last couple years. As those rates have gone up. So just kind of curious to get your thoughts on the psychology of the consumer or the homeowner and what REALTORS can do in 2023 to sort of adjust for that. Yeah, it's a great question because we are reaching an interesting kind of crossroads as far as the overall consumer mindset and set of experiences that are driving their behavior. Right. I think it's fair to say there have been, I would say three recent, relatively recent, honestly, relatively recent sets of kind of eras for buyers and sellers of real estate in the United States. Right. We had the pre-COVID era when we had a relatively short inventory relative to demand, but they weren't writing stories in the Washington post about. Inventory then COVID came and everybody kind of freaked out and we needed to kind of get our heads around what that meant and the real estate effects that happened were. You know, a lot of folks decided they were going to move from cities out to more suburban or rural areas. We saw a very high demand for housing turnover, especially for single family homes. And we also had an economy that warranted the need of kind of some kickstart programs to give us a chance to make sure that we could continue to function economically as a country. Whether or not those were necessary or viable solutions, I'm going to leave that up to somebody else to debate. But one of the kind of downstream results of that were extraordinarily low interest rates. As you mentioned before, for purchasers of real estate in the COVID or the very, you know, like the current COVID or the very post COVID time. So then that leads us to where we are now interest rates high inventory still a bit of a challenge in a lot of places still competitive markets in a lot of places. And real estate professionals looking to be planning their strategies for 2023. And a lot of questions are being asked about how do we reach sellers. We've got sellers who are unlikely to want to sell their home because where are they going to go? They don't have a lot of great inventory options. They don't have a lot of great interest rate options. What's the benefit to sell? And I want to put forward a couple of different ideas here. The first is you talked about what's the psychology and the mindset of sellers. I want to start by setting the tone in that we have to remember the psychology and mindset of sellers is not a single point of light. It is a significant gradation of various perspectives and viewpoints. We have to remember that yes, a lot of real estate was purchased in the COVID and immediately post COVID. If you can call it that era at low interest rates, but that does not make up the majority of home ownership right now by any stretch of the imagination. We have a good chunk of folks who owned their home long before COVID was even a thing have an incredible amount of equity in their home right now that is likely unrealized. We have a good chunk of folks who didn't refinance who are sitting on even post refinance are still sitting on a good chunk of equity. And where we find ourselves as real estate professionals is a place we haven't found ourselves in a long time, which is the number one priority for a lot of real estate professionals when it comes to listings and sellers and their psychology and mindset is one of education. Not of immediate opportunity. We are not answering calls from people saying, hey, I heard it's a great time to sell my house. Well, options do I have real estate professionals should consider those calls to be on hold for quite a while, maybe a year, maybe two years, frankly, we are needing to now shift our strategies to education and awareness because a lot of owners right now, either don't know their options or think they know their options when they don't really, which is frankly worse. So to answer your your mindset question, my initial response is most mindsets right now are either unaware or ignorant and these are places where yes, it makes things challenging. But for real estate professionals who can shift their strategies, that's a huge opportunity to It's such a it's such an interesting play this equity question. I think this is something that isn't typically, although I'm just thinking of myself and I might not be representative of the John Q public because I'm in the real estate business. So I probably look, I'm probably not the right sort of viewpoint here, but this idea of thinking about equity. I just don't think most homeowners are think about their equity, unless they're in the process of selling right I think it's they look at the appreciation. They look at the the amount they cut to the mortgage bank, the lender every month, they probably know their interest rate or their abouts. So I think those are kind of the three key metrics is what's my home worth. What am I paying every month? What's my what's my actual rates? I don't know and what what my home is even worth I think is oftentimes not really thought about all that much. But I think this idea of equity would be a real so I think that's our really interesting idea is like maybe being maybe I'm thinking about from an agent perspective. What would what do you think about an agent doing an evaluation. Not just what's your home worth because of course we can do automate those through CMAs and there's there's a million tools to do that. But what if an agent in 2023 said, hey, I know you might not be thinking of selling right now, but you did buy like seven years ago. And you've probably refinanced I'm sure you have a really low rate now, but let's take a look at the equity and see if that would actually influence your decision in being able to move. Maybe that even trumps. The interest rate that's currently out there because we can look at equity. We can look at pricing now has come down. So I'm just curious what you think of having that conversation with a home owner. I don't think anyone really has those conversations outside of real estate. Like I don't even think of financial advisor necessarily would say let's talk about the equity in your home. Because I think typically financial advisors don't look at that as asset until you actually cash it out. So yeah, go ahead. I'm sorry. No, no, that was my point was I think this is kind of an interesting opportunity for agents who really want to separate themselves is almost doing like a financial review of the home as opposed to just do you sell do you want a bigger place. Do you? Yeah, 100% in fact, this is actually it's funny you mentioned this because this was one of the topics I talked about last couple of weeks ago, a couple of weeks via when we're recording this. I was a presenter at the triple play conference in Atlantic City for New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania REALTORS. And one of the things I chatted about in one of my sessions there was I challenged folks a challenge real estate professionals who attended there to answer the following question. When you are representing a buyer in the purchase of real estate, when you finish at the closing table and the last signature is at the bottom of the final page. Your clients do they automatically magically somehow supernaturally get in doubt with the expertise and knowledge necessary to understand not just what they've purchased but the value of their home as an investment. The answer of course is no signing closing paperwork does not give you the insight to understand the value of your investment and I keep saying investment even if you're just buying a single family home to live in and to raise your kids in. You and I were talking earlier before we started recording this real estate is one of those unique purchases that as an investment it doesn't matter whether you're buying this as income producing or not. When you purchase real estate you're making an investment and it can turn out good or it could turn out bad you get to be in control of that and your control is significantly more fine tuned when you're aware of the ins and outs of your investment. So what I challenged folks to do what I challenged folks to do at triple play was to remember when somebody buys a home. They do not automatically become a real estate expert and an expert in terms of their homes value in the market their homes value in terms of the equity that they've collected and their homes value in terms of how competitive it could be for other home options. And so I challenged REALTORS there to set a schedule to become their buyers pro bono real estate financial advisor every year set a meeting where you offer to say hey I'd love to do an analysis of your investment let's find out how much it's worth let's find out how much equity you have in it let's find out how competitive your rates are I don't need to charge you for this I don't want to charge you for this. I only want to arm you with the information you need to make good decisions about your home those folks are going to not just become your client they're going to become your client for life by offering those services and for all those real estate professionals who are listening to this and say well I don't have this big buyer client pool to to draw from you have an unlimited set of people to draw from because there are millions tens of millions of homeowners in this country who's selling agent they are no longer in contract with who need and deserve this information and who you could start offering it to and by de facto become their agent so start reaching out to folks offer this financial analysis offer it completely free say I just want to arm you with the information that you need to make a good decision about your home these folks are going to become your client by virtue of offering this service and when it is time to sell and when you can demonstrate that they have a strategic advantage they're going to sell with you because you are the one that clearly is demonstrating that you know the mark of Yeah, this is a consultant perspective and I like the idea of not mentioning when when you're reaching out to two owners and they and again they don't have to be past clients they can be really anyone who owns a property and this idea of not saying hey I want to run a CMA I want to run comps for you which again there are lots of homeowners that understand that term or have heard that term before but the term they probably haven't heard is I want to evaluate your investment and this idea of it being now they hear that from their financial advisor's if they have one once a year usually they'll say hey we need to read you know look at the investments see how they did it stacked up against the the indexes or your overall you know financial goals and let's make sure we're on track to retire or whatever the you know send the kids to college or whatever it might be This is a very interesting alternative a way to to really do a CMA but not just a CMA so you're saying you know yeah they can get a CMA for anybody comps are pretty easy you can even just get them online without talking to a REALTOR but this is more of a what a financial advisor would do they'd sit down and say let's let's go over all the numbers not about all their other investments like a financial advisor would do but about just their home and thinking of it like an investment because while you were doing that while you were talking I was thinking what I did when I was ready to buy the property that I have now I was very nervous because it's obviously it was sizable purchase anyone who buys a home understands the nervousness there and everyone listening knows what it's like for their clients and I called a bunch of top REALTOR is in my area about five of them just to go am I making a mistake here because I was nervous and I wanted to get their advice and I reached out to people that I knew and said is this a good idea because it was new construction I was a little nervous as this overpriced and and I got really good advice that way and so I did a version of that by talking to other REALTORS most people aren't going to do that but I guess the point was I wanted somebody to tell me it's a good time to buy yes I give it my stamp of approval and I don't know that I would always I think that that's something that a lot of people want to know is I totally great and I don't know that they always trust the REALTOR to give them that information I think REALTORS are often seen as salespeople and salespeople are trying to sell and so whether or not the real estate agent has the best interest of the client at mind I think there there does have to be a little bit of change work around the language that's used when you call like I want to talk about your home as an investment and I want to talk about where that investment sits right now so that you can think about the future and think about if there's any plans that will change as a result of you really understanding where things are I mean I just think that's a powerful reframe and and a really really like unique approach well you know the interesting thing too is that the reef the the other kind of extension of this reframing the conversation gets into the way that our clients define their relationship with us so if I ask you you know if I ask you if I say I was new to Chicago and I said DJ I'd really need some suggestions I need a good doctor I need a dentist I need an accountant I need a chiropractor the people that you would refer to me or refer me to you would say oh yeah you should definitely check out my chiropractor it's just you know down on the down on this straight oh yeah you need an accountant my accountant I've been working working with him for years great guy you you'd love this guy oh you need a doctor the doctor I haven't gone to she's great uh you know a bunch of my family we all see her you just those those referrals totally natural language every single one of them was a you got to see my doctor my chiropractor my dentist for a car account or whatever but what it comes to real estate professionals when you say oh I'm looking to move to Chicago and I need a good real estate professional you would probably I mean I think the default for most folks is I know I know a great REALTOR yeah or I know a bunch of REALTORS yeah or I've I've you know I've worked with three different REALTORS in town I can give you all of their names if you want but I know a REALTOR in town or I know a ton of REALTORS or there are a ton of REALTORS we don't have this my professional relationship in the real estate space but that comes from the fact that you see your chiropractor on a regular basis you see your accountant on a regular basis you see your doctor we see our real estate professional once in a blue moon because our relationship is completely transaction oriented with those people it's not care and keeping oriented what you can adjust in 2023 not to make our chiropractor pun here but what you can adjust in 2023 is the way that you pursue that relationship with folks to say listen I want to be your REALTOR or your broker your agent so here's how we can do this and you know you can start by fostering these relationships with people you already are connected to but that doesn't have to be the case this is you know you start further back you know closer to zero if you're going you know you know it trying to prospect with people who you don't have a current relationship with but imagine just for a second the this value let's say you say you know I'd love to help you understand the value of your home help you understand when it's a great time to buy and sell somebody says yeah sure that'd be great you can pull somebody anybody you can you can request from your bank a mortgage statement these are on demand if you have an online portal you can get it instantly it will tell you all the details how much your loan was for what your current balance is what your equity is and what your rate is now as a savvy real estate professional I can also tell you banks don't typically do home equity loans if you have less than 20% equity but if you have more than 20% equity a bank will often lend you money against your equity so if you sit down with me and you say okay through our analysis I can see that you you have $200,000 left on your mortgage you have about $150,000 in equity on this property so you could qualify for refinance you could pull some of this equity out and do a project in the house you want a brand new kitchen this would pay for it you could sell right now if you sold right now even after fees you'd still be walking away with somewhere in the neighborhood of $120,000, $15,000 in your pocket what could we do with that people are going to look at you providing this value and options as all the evidence that they need that you have their best interest at heart and not yours it is no longer a transactional relationship it is a nurturing recurring value relationship just like those other professionals that I named earlier this is really a chance to set the tone for how you want to operate your business in 2023 I know a lot of REALTORS are nervous about this frankly this is an opportunity this is the time to put your foot on the gas not get back on your heels it's time to get on your toes yeah and I think I think your boy you just said so many things that I couldn't agree more with I think this is the opportunity to develop that annual you know touch that's not just a hey it's your birthday it's the holidays thanks for you know this is your home anniversary card for when you bought or sold all those things good too but this idea of actually providing real value once a year and the real value that I think the average homeowner is thinking about is or the average the question that they're thinking about is should I buy or sell right now should I move should I move right now I think is usually the main question and you know there's obviously pressures that you know with job changes and there's reasons that people move that I'm nothing to do with an annual review from from a REALTOR but boy I would love a service like that I would pay for a service like that I pay up a hundred or two hundred bucks a year for somebody to come in and say okay I looked at every I mean I pay a financial advisor I pay an account and I pay you know I would actually pay so this is something that you can do that's very valuable that I think people would pay for I don't know that you should charge people for it and maybe in some states you probably could charge but regardless I think it's it's you're right this is the value ad that is going to ensure that two things one that they're going to work with you in the future but two and this goes back to your hey you got to talk to my hair stylist or my account this this is going to get people talking I think and I think you could even tell them that when you're when you're doing these reviews is say hey you know this is something I do it's just my way of providing service but if you have other friends that are thinking should I buy should I sell is it a good time rates are up or inventory stuff I would love to do the same analysis for them and you could you know I think this could be a huge marketing strategy for people big time big time and you know let's like call a spade here too this is advantageous to real estate professionals not just in the fact that you have the opportunity to create more stable repeat business which is certainly a huge upside but let's also not discount the fact that if you can get this sort of relationship locked in you then they have a platform to give the sort of advice that includes things like hey you know how like yeah there are 12 there's 12 months in the year but if you decide that you're going to make one extra payment a month you can cut down on your interest costs over the course of you know X number of years and increase your equity by X percentage over X number of years this is really great for you this sounds like good advice it is good advice to homeowners but the other thing it does is you are setting yourself up to have a distant and near future clients who are more qualified who have higher budgets who are more educated about real estate and the process I mean imagine the difference between a listing where your seller not only do they know the real market value of their home before the listing appointment because you've already educated them on this but they also are realistic about what the next steps in tail your workload goes from 100 to five in that instant now granted you're doing that work on the front end but you're establishing it's kind of it has a slow drip of education and awareness in a way that other you know professionals have to kind of mainline all at once I have the front end sellers feel overwhelmed they're often miss the details that are necessary to take those shortcuts I mean this is a selfish strategy too you're going to develop regular bit a book of business from this strategy but you're also going to develop more qualified better informed and frankly clients with bigger budgets as a result which is going to affect positively our bottom lines as well I want to pause for a moment to talk about our episode sponsor are one of my favorite companies out there follow up boss now after interviewing hundreds of top

episode yeah it's really it's really interesting it's funny I've done 430 whatever episodes of this podcast where I've interviewed a lot of the very top producers in the country and I don't know that anyone's ever shared with me this idea of doing an annual people talk about doing an annual review but they haven't really got is granular about it as what you've mentioned and so if we were just to recap these steps so the idea is you would call people that are either past clients or you could say hey I'm trying I'm you could even tell people that weren't your past client and maybe you could even test it with people who might never use you but people who you could sort of try this approach with and say hey I'm I really want to bring more value to my clients next this upcoming year and I have found that my clients are constantly wondering what's going on in the market is it a good time for me to move should I sell should I buy and you know oftentimes they're not totally sure how to make sense of that answer and so I want to come in and just kind of evaluate what what you know your current position your current home your investment how it's doing how it's doing relative to other homes in the area and if you were thinking about moving you know here's here's kind of what you might be looking at so we can we're going to take a look at the full financial picture of that and give you a give you a recommendation yeah I think I gosh I think that's I mean you know look if I've ever been to an attorney the end of the damn like what's the recommend should I do this or not you know or an accountant should I declare this or not like I just want people's advice and I think the the REALTORS really should move away as far as they can from being labeled a salesperson as to a service professional or consultants I know consultants and you have to check with your state licensing to make sure that you can call yourself other things you definitely don't want to call yourself something that you're not supposed to but this idea of acting as if you are a consultant whether or not you use that word acting as if you would hire somebody to comment and say how do I fix my business and they go well I just looked at everything here's what you need to do well you know I'm going to give you the one this is the kind of a kind of a a dollop of Chris secret sauce to get this conversation started with people who you don't know you're like cold approaching on this here's the line and I guarantee it works because I've used it many times so if you're listening to this and I've used this on you sorry but here it is when you are cold approaching somebody you say I was just doing a CMA for a neighbor of yours and I used your property as a marker for value for the neighborhood I wanted to reach out to let you to let you know that I was just looking at values there I have a very good understanding of what your home is worth and would love to know if you're interested in this overall financial picture no obligation no cost I've already got the work done these are all the key phrases that's a great one I've already got the work done allows people to say yes without feeling like they're inconveniencing you or putting themselves in your debt that's a reason a lot of people say no to free things because they're like oh then I'm going to owe this person something say I've already got the work done then they have are free to say yes without the feeling of true or implied obligation say I was doing a CMA for a neighbor of yours this shows that you are active that you have experience that other people trust you these are true key phrases that are going to activate those parts in our brain we're like okay there is real value that I'm recognizing here I'm not being sold a gimmick I've got somebody who's providing real value in places that I trust in ways that I don't feel obligated I can say yes to this you're going to get in the doors if you use these lines I promise yeah you could even say something like I know this seems like a sales tactic but the reality of it is actually did this for your for your neighbor and I just already have the data done so I'm happy to share it with you yeah what's in it for me is maybe down the road maybe you would think about me if you ever needed to find a professional but but what I wanted to share with you is actually just something I did for your neighbor anyway you probably wouldn't even have to say it that way but the point is as you could you could explain it and and be totally forthright about it and still likely get very little resistance so this is a great great place to wrap up so I really want one everyone to think about 2023 and I know there's a lot of nervous energy in the agent world I know our agents are scared I know our broker owners are are have some fear about 2023 and what we're trying to find is opportunities that can keep you focused and active and this idea of doing annual reviews and not just what's your home worth and what's you know what what are the homes near you worth but actually looking at equity looking at rates looking at refri looking at all of all of the things that people don't usually look at in one overarching sort of view right they look at little things like hope the rates that and my home is worth this over here and it's it's not really a cohesive picture and you could provide that picture to them and you could even if you really wanted to get granular just one other idea as you could talk to their financial advisor too you could say hey if you have and by the way it's another great person in network with because of course those opportunities are pretty obvious but you could even say hey I want to run this by your financial advisor and just make sure I get their sign off on it which then if they like their financial advisor and maybe you're not their current REALTOR provide some social proof where they might consider using you in the future so you can even go that further step is saying hey I want to talk to your your financial advisor about this if you're not you know so anyway but Chris let's talk about the clothes in the last minute
