[00:01:16] Today's episode is brought to you by corded.io.
[00:01:19] Are you looking for agents to join your brokerage or team?
[00:01:23] Now, as a real estate recruiter, I can tell you the answer is always yes.
[00:01:27] But most agents aren't looking to move right now.
[00:01:30] So how do you know who to contact?
[00:01:32] Well, what if I were to tell you there's a recruiting and retention tool powered by
[00:01:36] artificial intelligence that shows you exactly which agents in your local market are looking
[00:01:41] to leave their brokerage right now and which agents at your own firm are also looking
[00:01:47] to leave you?
[00:01:48] Now, I've been recruiting REALTORS for 15 years and I've hired over 2000 agents.
[00:01:53] I can tell you with no exaggeration, this is the tool I've been waiting for.
[00:01:57] Corded's AI looks for trends across dozens of variables for each agent in your market
[00:02:02] and shows you which agents they believe are likely to move.
[00:02:06] Not only does it do that, but corded's AI went and visited my recruiting website and
[00:02:11] read everything I offer.
[00:02:12] So now when I'm recruiting, corded's AI tells me exactly what to say based on that
[00:02:18] agent's needs and what my brokerage can offer.
[00:02:20] It even writes emails for me.
[00:02:22] I've never seen anything like it and I use it every single day.
[00:02:26] Now, if you are looking to grow your brokerage, corded.io is the best tool out there.

[00:02:36] And now, onto the show.
[00:02:53] Hello and welcome to another episode of the Real The Largest Podcast, made by Real Estate
[00:02:58] Agent, seven years strong and over 700 episodes.
[00:03:02] I think we will ask out at some point.
[00:03:04] Anyway, I'm DJ Paris.
[00:03:05] I'm your guide and host through the show.
[00:03:07] Glad you're here.
[00:03:08] Welcome if you're new.
[00:03:09] And as always, the best way you can help us is to tell a friend.
[00:03:13] So let other people know about this show and then let us know what we can do to even make
[00:03:17] it better for you.
[00:03:19] And if you have somebody in your market where there's just like the super amazing top producer
[00:03:23] and you're like, how do they do that?
[00:03:25] Tell us who that person is.
[00:03:27] I will get them on the show and I will find out how they do that so you don't even have
[00:03:30] to.
[00:03:30] And that would be fun as well.
[00:03:32] In just a moment, I'm going to be speaking with top agent Jeff Bebuck.
[00:03:35] And this is a really fun interview because Jeff not only is a top amazing agent and he's
[00:03:40] really amazing.
[00:03:41] He works with celebrities and top business executives.
[00:03:44] And in top of that, he is also a super big tech guy.
[00:03:48] So he sits on boards for all of these AI tech companies, especially a lot of real estate
[00:03:52] tech companies.
[00:03:53] So he knows what's coming for us and he knows how to future proof your business so that
[00:03:57] you will still be relevant.
[00:03:59] So this is a great episode.
[00:04:00] It'll make you feel a lot better about the future and it'll tell you what to do in order
[00:04:05] to protect yourself and move forward.
[00:04:07] And also how to use some of these tools to your advantage to help rise above the competition.
[00:04:12] So let's just get right to it.
[00:04:14] My conversation with Jeff Bebuck.
[00:04:28] Best advice.
[00:04:33] Best advice.
[00:04:34] I got a lot of really bad advice.
[00:04:35] So I avoid the bad advice which in turn becomes the best advice I can.
[00:04:44] Honestly, I think the best advice I've gotten is from the mistakes I've learned because
[00:04:49] otherwise it wouldn't have been good advice to myself.
[00:04:52] I could take advice from anybody and everything and it's their experience, not mine.
[00:04:57] So I take advice from the, I wouldn't call them failures, but the lessons I've learned
[00:05:02] on the way.
[00:05:03] It sounds crazy.
[00:05:05] No, it's the only way we learn, right?
[00:05:07] So you're talking about the willingness to fail and fail in a sense of just not getting
[00:05:13] the outcome you desire and then going back.
[00:05:16] And it's of course how everything works, but it doesn't feel good in the moment.
[00:05:20] So it's like this.
[00:05:22] If it's hard and it sort of puts a pit in your stomach and you don't get what you want,
[00:05:26] it's just another opportunity to go back and do it again.
[00:05:29] You know, it's weird DJ2 is I think it's the perception of how you categorize failure.
[00:05:35] Yeah.
[00:05:36] So I'll look at something that failed and I believe me some of the mistakes I've made.
[00:05:40] There was like a big price tag to it or time and times worth more than money.
[00:05:46] But as I got drugged on the rabbit hole and let's say I was up, this just happened.
[00:05:51] $40,000, $50,000 in six months of my time where I had to step back and say, stop it.
[00:05:56] You're just trying to win and you're eating a square peg in a round hole.
[00:06:01] And what the hell are you doing this for?
[00:06:03] And I had to step back and become aware and almost kind of float above it and just kind
[00:06:07] of watch myself as a spectator and go, okay, idiot, what are you doing?
[00:06:12] Let's just start over here and let's unwire this thing and let's not get mad at
[00:06:16] herself because when we bring in all that bad stuff is the perception of making a mistake,
[00:06:22] your ego or whatever gets hit.
[00:06:24] And you have to step away from it.
[00:06:26] And if you can successfully step away and go, thank you for the lesson.
[00:06:30] Yeah, I was really pushing on that and I was wrong.
[00:06:33] And I literally put it on a shelf.
[00:06:35] My mom called it, my not to be religious, and I think my mom called it Jesus, take the wheel, right?
[00:06:40] She's like, let God figure it out or the universe, whatever.
[00:06:42] So I learned how to put this in this universal shelf of like whoever's out there,
[00:06:47] go figure this out, not to be too woo or anything.
[00:06:49] But what it does is it just takes it out of your brain and puts it in another place.
[00:06:52] And then this thing called faith of knowing that the answer will be downloaded to you in the morning.
[00:06:57] And I wake up with a fricking answer every time.
[00:07:00] Don't work from, I don't know.
[00:07:03] But you're not alone in that experience.
[00:07:06] So what I heard is a lot of what is what is mindfulness.
[00:07:10] And it's funny, mindfulness is a word that gets thrown around a lot.
[00:07:14] And the way that I understand it and the way that I've started to develop it,
[00:07:18] and it's really difficult, but it's sort of the pinging back and forth between first person
[00:07:24] experience.
[00:07:25] You know, I'm Jeff having this major challenge and I'm sinking all this cost into this time
[00:07:30] and time into this project that isn't working.
[00:07:32] But I can figure it out.
[00:07:33] I know I can do it.
[00:07:34] And then, you know, not maybe seeing it so objectively and rationally.
[00:07:37] And then having to be able to go to third person, which is kind of what you were saying,
[00:07:41] you know, floating above and saying, wait a minute, the wiser, smarter, Jeff or the universe
[00:07:46] can take a better, more accurate look at this and say, what's going on here?
[00:07:50] Same thing with emotions, right?
[00:07:51] We can have this incredibly challenging, immediate reaction to something.
[00:07:56] And then if we float above and look at ourselves in third person and say, oh, he's upset because,
[00:08:02] you know, his, you know, he didn't get what he needed as a child.
[00:08:04] He's running this pattern.
[00:08:05] That's just what he does.
[00:08:07] It's what his brain does.
[00:08:08] Okay, that's okay.
[00:08:09] He doesn't realize he's doing it.
[00:08:10] I'm going to go back into his brain and kind of tell him you don't have to do that right
[00:08:14] now.
[00:08:14] So I'm with you.
[00:08:15] I think what you just are talking about is mindfulness, which is one of the most useful
[00:08:20] skills I didn't know how useful it was until I started learning how to actually do it.
[00:08:24] And it took years.
[00:08:26] And I'm not, I still struggle with it.
[00:08:28] But it's this idea of being able to watch myself in real time doing something and going,
[00:08:34] oh, DJ's doing this thing that doesn't make a lot of sense.
[00:08:37] And we can possibly, you know, change it or I'm going to turn it over like you did release
[00:08:41] control, which is the hardest thing to do.
[00:08:44] And just assume that it's going to get worked out like something will figure this out.
[00:08:49] And like you said, maybe even throwing it into the ether and waking up with the answer.
[00:08:53] So I love that.
[00:08:54] You know, I'm sorry for talking so much about this, but I think it is such a powerful thing.
[00:08:59] It's like intuition almost.
[00:09:01] Yeah, we're asking advice from your higher self.
[00:09:03] So you're really asking advice from someone, but you're actually asking it from the experiences.
[00:09:08] And so if you didn't have those stepping stones of what you want to call a mistake, I don't
[00:09:11] call them the stakes.
[00:09:12] I just, you know, I, I fail up.
[00:09:14] And if they want to know how much they cost and asking your forgiveness for them or asking
[00:09:19] forgiveness to your business partner, hey, Dan, I just, my business partner.
[00:09:23] Yeah, I know he spent $40,000 and five months of just, I wouldn't call it wasted time,
[00:09:28] but look at the result.
[00:09:29] And now we're going to 10x wave and have a way better result because of that.
[00:09:34] And I just learned how to figure out how to get there faster by not beating myself up
[00:09:40] to the destination of what I thought that destination was.
[00:09:43] Because that destination comes back completely different almost every time.
[00:09:46] I'm like, wow, I never saw that angle.
[00:09:48] That's cool.
[00:09:49] So in being open to it, you know, that's really, that's really what I've learned in the last two years
[00:09:54] as a leader.
[00:09:55] You know, I worsted advice you've received.
[00:09:59] Don't listen to everybody else.
[00:10:03] Seriously, because at the end of the day, you're responsible for yourself.
[00:10:06] It's good to gather information.
[00:10:07] It's great to have mentors.
[00:10:08] It's great to take all that and absorb it and think about it and put that also on the shelf.
[00:10:16] Okay, I've collected all this data.
[00:10:18] You know, I've done some mistakes.
[00:10:20] I've got some great advice from other people.
[00:10:22] This is what they did.
[00:10:23] I'm going to put that in conjunction with everything else to get back to me to, you know,
[00:10:28] to come into play and figure out some kind of solution for it.
[00:10:32] You know, it's there.
[00:10:32] You just don't hear it.
[00:10:33] It's clouded with the promptors from self limiting beliefs
[00:10:38] that we've all created because that Darwinism thing in our brain that is protected
[00:10:43] us at one point in time for, you know, Hey, man, I can't admit I made a mistake
[00:10:48] because it would show weakness or hey, man, I can't do this because of that.
[00:10:51] Any of these little, you know, I call it monkey brain.
[00:10:55] And the monkey brain is always those little things whispering you can't, you know,
[00:10:59] mommy and daddy issues, all that kind of stuff.
[00:11:01] You just got to step away from it and say that happened in the past.
[00:11:05] It protected me at the time.
[00:11:07] I'm going to take this old guard that served me and I'm going to upbring him from a soldier
[00:11:12] to a general and say don't do that shit again and you're not fighting anymore, right?
[00:11:16] And so you're really recruiting your new army of sages versus shitheads.
[00:11:22] The promptors you know that screwed you up in the past, you know.
[00:11:25] And then like we were talking about this before we started, but then just acting differently.
[00:11:30] Right. So it's like, yes, you you have these wounds.
[00:11:33] We all have wounds.
[00:11:33] We all have things that happened to us that weren't great.
[00:11:35] And once we're aware of those patterns, we can literally just act differently.
[00:11:40] You know, you could just be the person you want to be with the resources that you want.
[00:11:46] And you get different results when you just act as as if and it's not, it's not a lie, right?
[00:11:52] It's not, hey, I'm competent when I'm not because people will see that right away.
[00:11:56] But it's it's this I am going to become this person who has these resources who reacts differently,
[00:12:03] who does different behaviors.
[00:12:05] And then eventually the brain just goes, okay, I guess we're doing that now.
[00:12:09] And it figures it out.
[00:12:10] You just retrain your brain and then you get the dopamine hit from that going,
[00:12:14] oh, I like doing this stuff.
[00:12:15] You know, it's like the working out of socks every time you go,
[00:12:20] January 1st, I get a gym membership that I don't show up two months later.
[00:12:23] And I paid for, you know, a month and a half or maybe even two weeks of a whole year of a gym
[00:12:27] membership that I never showed up for.
[00:12:29] But I can't cancel it because I'll feel guilty because I am a loser.
[00:12:32] I didn't go work out, you know.
[00:12:34] But if you just walked in, I mean, just set your phone to like 5,000 to 6,000 steps a day,
[00:12:40] that's working out.
[00:12:41] And if you did that consistently, the results you'd get from going to the gym two weeks out of the year
[00:12:46] would be astronomically compounded interest results versus, you know,
[00:12:53] feeling bad about something that you attempted to do and failed, you know.
[00:12:56] Yeah. And then if you can't do it yourself, what I had to do for the gym and again,
[00:13:00] I use this, I talk about this a lot of the show and I apologize to our listeners who've heard me say
[00:13:05] it, but if you haven't and you're new, this was helpful for me. It's the expensive option.
[00:13:09] But it works for me as I couldn't get to the gym myself. I let myself off the hook. I just wouldn't go.
[00:13:14] And finally at 42, I said, I got to get a trainer because it's so expensive that I will definitely
[00:13:20] show up and I've been the trainer now six years. And it also forces me to make more money because I
[00:13:26] have to pay the trainer. And I know that the moment I can I can't afford it, I will stop.
[00:13:32] And I am like in really the best shape of my life and I've never missed. But, but you know,
[00:13:39] I pay for it, but it's that's what works for me. And so I had to like, you know, I had to try all
[00:13:44] these different things and it was like, oh, I just need to pay for it. And when I pay for it,
[00:13:47] I'll actually do it. And hopefully our listeners who are struggling with the gym, hopefully you don't
[00:13:52] have to do that because that's a really expensive way to do it. But whatever works works. So anyway,
[00:13:57] I am a big big believer and just keep trying different things until something works like you were
[00:14:02] saying. Jeff Beebook is our guest today. And he's a founding member of Frontgate Real Estate,

[00:15:06] Thank you. Nice to meet you, DJ. Finally meet you, I should say because I was watching the show
[00:15:11] and it's like, oh yeah, Tim, that's a lovely person. Well, I think you and I have a lot of
[00:15:17] things in common and it's really cool to this is one of the best parts for me on this show is
[00:15:22] getting to meet people like you because I just, you know, I love being able to talk to people who
[00:15:27] are kind of at the forefront of not just this industry, but other industries. You know, you're a
[00:15:31] real you're a tech guy and you're also into marketing and you just have a lot of thoughts and I love
[00:15:36] people that have thoughts. So we're going to get into some of those thoughts. Let's first talk about
[00:15:41] your transition because you started in an entertainment, right? And then went into real estate.
[00:15:47] So how and why? I think it started first with, you know, I was in I was in bands. I traveled and
[00:15:54] you know, played out here in California, sunset strip, troubadour, all that kind of cool stuff,
[00:15:58] you know, I was a kid that was listening to Indochroid listening to early Van Halen and Kiss,
[00:16:04] you know, and laying in bed going, pretending I was in the show, you know, literally pretending,
[00:16:09] I don't know why it just happened and I was fascinated with it and I was pretending in my head,
[00:16:14] remember it laying in my bunk bed, my shared bedroom with my brother, having a rock concert listening
[00:16:20] to, you know, these bands and then getting all these cool magazines back there and they were
[00:16:24] talking about this LA thing and the sunset strip and, you know, where all these bands came from.
[00:16:32] And I kind of just, you know, I don't know if I even purposely did it, I just ramped about it so
[00:16:37] much of that I just ended up fast forward. I'm standing on the stage at the troubadour for show and
[00:16:42] I'm looking down at my boots going, wow Jim Morrison stood here, I'm like, oh crap, I'm done,
[00:16:47] this is, that's a bucket list, what's next? So same thing happened with real estate, it was,
[00:16:53] you know, not that I dreamt about, you know, oh god, I wish I was a big, huge, real estate agent and
[00:16:58] I, no, that was not a dream. But what happened was, is I bought a couple houses, my wife got pregnant
[00:17:08] with her first son, didn't know we were doing a bought a house, we go out for our first walk and
[00:17:13] we just realized it was like straight downhill and we couldn't walk to anything, you know, so we had
[00:17:18] to get in the car and drive and she looked at me and she's like, oh man, we screwed up, like, damn it.
[00:17:23] So, when in, did some little repairs to fix it up, you know, didn't realize that we were at the
[00:17:31] crux of starting to flip properties, but we fixed it up, my hard to realize that agent,
[00:17:35] um, did not do a good job, didn't answer my questions, I felt just kind of really like lost in the
[00:17:42] process and nervous and scared, first house, all this money, I'm like, oh my god, this is a huge
[00:17:47] life moment, you know, here's our first kid, if we screw this up, what happens? So we sell the house,
[00:17:53] we did very well with it, didn't really do, it was kind of like an accidental flip, and then I
[00:17:58] saw what the agent got paid and the money he made and what I got in return for it, and I'm like,
[00:18:03] screw that, I'm gonna go get a real estate license and not pay that guy again, you know, not realizing
[00:18:08] that I probably didn't have that good of an agent, you know, at the time, and then we flipped,
[00:18:14] I don't even know, it would not even purposely, but I think we've only lived in houses from 18 months
[00:18:19] to two years to, you know, for tax purposes or whatever, and did that 15, 20 times. Wow, and,
[00:18:25] you know, and I ended up getting the license kind of just to save the money, but then when I was
[00:18:29] doing that, since I came from the music industry, a couple of my buddies that could buy big houses,
[00:18:34] were like, hey dude, I trust you, sell me big house, I'm like, all right, and then I got the
[00:18:38] paycheck for that, and I'm for a $5 million deal, I was like, whoa, I can do this, and I even have to
[00:18:44] flip a house, maybe I should do both, and that's what happened, how we got into luxury, and that's
[00:18:48] how I got into investing in homes. Wow, and amazing, and so that's how you built your clientele,
[00:18:56] was through your own investing, and people seeing what you're doing, and saying, hey, he seems to
[00:19:00] know something, and it wasn't the traditional getting out there and kind of beating the pavement,
[00:19:05] and becoming the local guy, I guess. Yeah, I mean, that, and I've always been brutally just
[00:19:13] savagely honest with people, not even just people or agents on my team, but just even clients,
[00:19:18] and if they came to me, and I'm dealing with these, you know, higher end properties, and they ask me
[00:19:24] my opinion, I'm like, you know, I don't know, I never knew it this man, but I'll find out, and I
[00:19:29] will get the best answer possible, because I have connections to everybody and anybody that I need
[00:19:33] to find this answer. So, you know, I never tried to fake someone out to work with me for something
[00:19:39] that I wasn't, you know, what I was was brutally honest, and then I would get back to you with an
[00:19:44] answer, versus trying to keep that client engaged, and being, I wouldn't say fake about it, but
[00:19:51] giving him some advice that I wasn't exactly sure, and I'm sure we've all been in that position,
[00:19:55] before where you wanted to sound knowledgeable, you gave some advice, but then later on you found
[00:19:59] up like, well, shit, that was totally wrong, should I just not say anything, just let it ride, I don't
[00:20:03] know, you know, so that's my best advice for anybody, just be brutally honest, if you don't know
[00:20:09] the answer, I would, you know, do unto others, if some, if my accountant, my accountant doesn't know
[00:20:13] a lot of shit, you know, he does where he needs to know it, but if he needs to find something out,
[00:20:18] I trust him, because he goes, no, I don't know, I got to check on that, or if I have an attorney,
[00:20:22] I don't know, I got to check on that, I'm not expecting to answer that minute, I'm expecting
[00:20:26] an answer, but when he comes back to me with 15 different options, because he looked into it,
[00:20:30] I'm like, that's my guy, and you've got to be, you know, yeah, it's, it's getting to the information,
[00:20:36] I love that, that sort of attitude when you do meet a service person who goes, oh, that's a good
[00:20:42] question, I'm going to find out and get back to you, I look, they get excited even, like it's, it's,
[00:20:46] like, oh, this person's into their job, you know, and that's, that's what you want from anybody,
[00:20:50] who you're hiring. So I love that. What was the biggest sort of change for you, or the biggest
[00:20:56] surprise maybe, switching from music and entertainment to real estate? Like, are, are, are, are those worlds
[00:21:03] similar in any way, or are they different? You know, I mean, obviously, the content is different, but,
[00:21:09] but how are those worlds intersect?
[00:21:11] It was Getty Lee says and rushed like all the worlds and the stage and we're, we're merely players,
[00:21:17] right? I don't even think it's Getty Lee, I think it's Shakespeare, but it's true. I mean, it's just
[00:21:21] a different stage, you know, it's a different place to show up, it's a different place to perform,
[00:21:26] you know, it's a different place to build a tribe. So I always kind of looked at, and I'd never
[00:21:32] thought I'd have 60-age in team, or band, yeah, I look at it like this way, we went from doing local
[00:21:38] bars to Lala Pallusa to Coachella to, you know, getting it, you know, as the team gets bigger,
[00:21:44] there's more roadies, there's more road managers, there's more accountants, there's all this kind of
[00:21:48] stuff, and I, and I don't want to make it not fun anymore, you know, I want to be able to like,
[00:21:55] if I'm going on stage and being able to perform that all the chaos that happens behind as you
[00:22:01] grow bigger on this tour doesn't take the life out of that performance, meaning that the message I'm
[00:22:07] trying to do, whether it's a first time home buyer, an agent starting out on my team trying to build
[00:22:12] their career, I want to come into that fresh and full of energy and, and, and focus, so that
[00:22:21] doesn't get watered down because I just got too much other noise and I can't bother with you,
[00:22:25] because I think that's what takes away from a lot of artists, I think that takes away from
[00:22:29] almost anyone. So I really try to get that laser energy focus, like it was the first time, you know,
[00:22:34] and, and, and really focus on that versus getting it watered down to when you scale out too big,
[00:22:41] you just lose it, you know, I love that. So really trying to make sure that at the end of the day,
[00:22:47] the end, the end product, I guess, is, is a laser focused product and getting all of the background
[00:22:55] operational stuff sort of figured out and not letting it affect the performance, I guess, is,
[00:23:00] is 100% I got a call yesterday, I got really upset because what I promise I deliver and, and because
[00:23:07] it's not a person on my team's fault if we get too big, that it doesn't matter, right? So at one of
[00:23:14] my agents that was very important, she was getting her real estate career back on track, which is why
[00:23:19] she joined my team, right? And I'm getting pages of partner to perform, so if she comes on, and for
[00:23:25] whatever reason, something didn't happen, it just listed just sold, it could be mean-eal stuff,
[00:23:29] like who gives a shit, right? I don't know if someone didn't see her post that nobody's looking at,
[00:23:32] you know, your page because you don't have enough followers anyway, but it mattered to her.
[00:23:37] And it could, and that right person might have seen it regardless of the size of that,
[00:23:41] so it could have been frivolous, but for me personally, I was like, hey, why didn't that happen?
[00:23:46] And that's what I promised and I had to go back to my team and go, guys, figure out where this broke
[00:23:51] and I never wanted to happen again because you are affecting my relationship with this client,
[00:23:57] because they're going to lose trust for me because I promised them something.
[00:24:01] And that upset me more than anything this week. And I went to the Zillow Convention.
[00:24:05] So that's bad. Not the Zillow Convention, but I mean, the fact that that bothered me more
[00:24:11] means that I'm laser focused on serving the agent on my team and their client and their
[00:24:16] performance versus this big ecosystem of like Zillow, you know, tying it into my team and doing
[00:24:21] the sales. That's more important to me. Yeah, no, it's expecting a high level of service, right?
[00:24:27] And so that's, I think those are good things to get upset about, you know, in a reasonable way,
[00:24:34] right? So, yeah, we could certainly, I found that the top agents and had a lot of the nation's
[00:24:41] top agents on the show and people like yourself who they just expect more. They just sort of go,
[00:24:48] I just got to sort of do a little better than everybody else. And it doesn't necessarily even
[00:24:53] mean work harder, although that usually is part of it. But it's part of this like level of
[00:24:57] standard. It's like, we're just going to raise our standards. We're going to be the Ritz Carlton,
[00:25:01] as opposed to, you know, a look into, and there's nothing wrong with being a look into if that's
[00:25:05] if that's your market. But if you want to play in a different, you know, type of arena, you have
[00:25:10] to show up a little differently. And so I totally, totally agree with that and having those
[00:25:16] standards well defined and expecting that from the team makes sense. And we should also mention,
[00:25:20] by the way, and Jeff has an amazing team. He has 60 people and he's with Compass, a great company,
[00:25:26] and he is always looking for more talent. Just, you know, I'm a recruiter. I know that, that as well.
[00:25:33] So if you are somebody who is in the, you know, the sort of that area of the country and you are
[00:25:39] maybe independent or maybe you're on a team yourself and you're not getting what you need, maybe
[00:25:44] you're not getting the direction or the tools are the support and you're looking to see what other
[00:25:49] teams provide and what you can offer a team. I would encourage you to reach out to Jeff. What's
[00:25:53] the best way another agent if they want to connect with you? How should they do that?
[00:25:57] Thank you. Just go on Frank8realistate.com in the top. It says join the team and all the
[00:26:03] information is on there about what we offer, what we do, the surface level of it, and then it's just
[00:26:07] connecting with me. Yeah. And we just kind of look at each agent that comes on the team individually.
[00:26:13] Everybody's different, man. Everyone has superpowers and everyone has crypto tonight. I'm not going to
[00:26:17] try to force someone to become better like Superman, kryptonite's kryptonite. It's going to hurt you.
[00:26:25] It's not going to ever help. The best thing you can do is get it away and focus on the super power.
[00:26:31] So that's what we do. So if an agent has a kryptonite, why am I forcing? Use this. Do this. You have
[00:26:36] to learn to do that. If it doesn't feel comfortable, don't do it. There's a way. If there's a will,
[00:26:40] there's a way we find out what that way is because the will is already there and then we just 10X that
[00:26:45] and take the kryptonite away. That's our superpowers. The team because that's what I realized that I
[00:26:52] hate forcing anything. I'm not a stick guy. I'm a carrot guy. And I like carrots better than sticks.
[00:27:01] Who doesn't? Yeah. And not every team works that way. There are some teams that are stick focused.
[00:27:07] And that works for them. But yeah, I'm the, I absolutely feel the same way. And I think most agents
[00:27:13] probably do. So when you have top top performing team members and you know part of your job,
[00:27:21] I guess, is the team lead is to keep them motivated. And I think it sounds like you do that by
[00:27:26] really recognizing their individual goals and talents and really kind of leaning and going,
[00:27:31] let me help you solve this. We'll find, because it's all about solving problems. And that's what you're
[00:27:37] really just a master problem solver. And by doing that, you're going to enable your team to succeed.
[00:27:43] So I am curious. I want to switch gears just a little bit because I want to talk about market
[00:27:49] dynamics because we are the markets. Obviously, it's kind of an unusual place and it depends
[00:27:55] where market you're in. But on the west coast, I'm curious to get your thoughts. But you know,
[00:28:00] Zillow, you were just out with Zillow. So I have been to some of those Zillow events as well. And I
[00:28:06] love it. I have a great relationship with people at Zillow. And they always have interesting insights
[00:28:11] with the data that they have. And a lot of it's stuff that isn't super intuitive. So I'm curious,
[00:28:17] what are you seeing out there and what are you thinking about as sort of for the future?
[00:28:21] Well, everybody's going to have their own micro community area level of things that happened.
[00:28:26] For instance, where we're at, you know, we have these Wolsey fires before the LA Pacific
[00:28:31] Palisades fires. Wolsey fires are right in our backyard. This house, this room I'm sitting in
[00:28:35] right now is evacuated from this house twice. So what's happening, and it's happening across
[00:28:41] the country, you know, Florida with floods, Texas with storms, I mean, you name it at California
[00:28:47] with fires. But I just, we just closed the house down and I did. There was an $8 million
[00:28:54] newer construction. It was almost through $280,000 a year premium.
[00:28:59] Wow.
[00:29:00] 288, that's due to the math, 27ish through 26,000 a month for insurance.
[00:29:06] Wow.
[00:29:07] So and for a million dollar house, it could be 20,000 to 30,000, depending where it's at. So we're
[00:29:13] in a severe fire zone. So that basically really is brought our market down to almost 60, 65%,
[00:29:20] which is catastrophic. Yeah, especially in the high end too, because it was that much more affordable.
[00:29:24] But it's irrelevant. If it's a million dollar house or 10 million, it's going to be that same
[00:29:30] level of you double or triple the insurance, you're going to have that same problem basically. So
[00:29:36] insurability became an issue with affordability. And then you got the interest rates and all that
[00:29:42] kind of stuff. So we've seen a massive, you know, shift in our market. But we diversified. One
[00:29:48] great thing about Zillow is Zillow honestly kind of helps save our team. You know, yes, there's
[00:29:54] hefty fees when you're on a Zillow flex. But having said that, we were able to diversify spread out
[00:29:58] across all of greater Los Angeles into different markets where we didn't even think about going
[00:30:04] before because we're, you know, a luxury, you know, brand that was like hyper focused on a certain
[00:30:10] area. And, you know, 60 agents and, you know, we, I think we did 100 million was Zillow last year.
[00:30:16] It really helped. I don't even know, you know, very good possibility. You might not have been
[00:30:20] there with that, you know, with that situation. So that was a blessing and that worked out well.
[00:30:29] But I think from a macro level, from what I've heard and from incredible conversations I've had
[00:30:35] with, you know, top team leaders. I mean, I've talked a rubber, you know,
[00:30:39] Reffkin with Compass personally all the time, speaking with very higher up at Zillow.
[00:30:45] You just hear kind of where the market's shifting, what's going on. I really feel and they feel
[00:30:49] like we really hit the bottom August was probably the crappiest year of real estate in the last 30
[00:30:54] years, you know, this last August. So what their predictions are is that, you know, everyone's going
[00:31:00] to have different hyper local situations. But, you know, we're going to hum along here and it's going
[00:31:05] to be a little bit more steadier and it's not going to be this volatile up and down where we're
[00:31:09] going to just going to see a nice flattening to a gradual, you know, new normal. What that normal
[00:31:16] looks like, well, it's not going to be the unicorn years of what happened, you know,
[00:31:20] right up with COVID. And I think I think the volatility is going to be a little bit more
[00:31:26] removed for the market to not have those epic spikes and values, which I'll take because
[00:31:32] try to run a business on that. I'm like, God, I mean, we all know that, you know,
[00:31:35] that our pay for the last two years. So you had a massive change because I, yeah, I wasn't
[00:31:42] even thinking about the insurability issue. Yeah, you got hit hard because of course, that just,
[00:31:47] just pull so many people out of that, that geographic area because it just doesn't make sense anymore.
[00:31:54] And you guys, you guys pivoted, which is really amazing. And obviously, something you, you probably,
[00:32:00] you know, had to do and did it and we're successful at that. I always think it's so cool when you
[00:32:06] talk to people who really understand running their business like a business because challenges
[00:32:11] happen. We've had it here at our firm, our version of what happened to you. And yeah, you
[00:32:17] would literally have to pivot. And then you're just like, oh, you just kind of take that same skill set
[00:32:20] and apply it elsewhere. And, you know, you figure out a solution. So cheer my hats off to you because
[00:32:26] I think I'm probably a lot of agents who were in that space, probably just, it was probably super
[00:32:32] depressing. And they probably didn't pivot as much as maybe they should have or as much as you
[00:32:37] did. And I think that's just incredible. So again, another reason to consider joining Jeff's team is,
[00:32:43] you know, they are going to make changes. They're not the battleship in the bathtub. They can,
[00:32:47] they can pivot when they need to. And that is something that great teams do. And, you know, other teams,
[00:32:55] you know, move all behind you. I'm curious, what do you think's going to happen? Because AIs
[00:33:00] here, of course, and we're all using it to some degree, at least to rewrite our listing descriptions.
[00:33:04] But we should be using it for much more than that. And in fact, if you're going to use it to write
[00:33:09] your, rewrite your listing descriptions, at least do a good job of writing a prompt to get a good
[00:33:13] listing description. But I don't think a lot of agents are even doing that. Just like copying,
[00:33:17] pasting it and, and hoping it rewrites it well. But, but again, yeah, I can do so much more. But
[00:33:23] what are you seeing? What do you think? Because you're a tech guy. Where do you think AIs, what do you
[00:33:29] think A is going to do to agents? Is it a net positive? Is it a net negative? What agents will be a
[00:33:34] fact did? What agents will be empowered? Sort of what are your thoughts there? Sure. I think it's all
[00:33:39] how you kind of look at it again. Because at the end of the day, you know, AIs, everyone, you know,
[00:33:44] scary, scary, scary. It's going to be like, you know, all those movies we've watched from what,
[00:33:48] like, from total recall, determinator to Iroh Bot, right? It was just like taking over the world
[00:33:54] and, you know, blowing us up. Yeah, I mean, it is fascinating that some of the stuff that we're
[00:34:01] able to do now is wow, that really helped me out. But, you know, it hallucinates a lot. Not
[00:34:06] everything's perfect. It's going to take a while for it to really to do that. But I think what's
[00:34:12] going to happen from what I'm seeing. And here's a perfect example. And I'm sure everybody listening
[00:34:17] right now knows exactly what I'm talking about, including yourself, DJs, that you get that phone
[00:34:22] call, right? And you hear that pause, you know, like, hello, hello. Ding is like, oh, hello, Jeff,
[00:34:28] how are you today? I mean, I can't hang up fast enough, you know, my reaction is like,
[00:34:33] foodie it, you know, click is like interrupted me, you know, right? And I don't think I've
[00:34:40] ever gotten through an A iPhone call. Me neither. I don't think anybody has because it's just,
[00:34:47] we don't want to talk to Rulow. We're talking. So having said that, you know,
[00:34:55] and our brains have now tuned into it very quickly. I get an email from someone I'm like,
[00:34:59] yeah, I use Chatchee BT. He doesn't talk like that myself too. I mean, I could put my email like,
[00:35:04] you know, if I wrote it, this was not written by Chatchee BT, you know, or if it was a laugh and go,
[00:35:10] yeah, yeah, that was that was the help of AI Jeff or whatever. But in its great for that, I love it.
[00:35:15] I just did 10 things today that enhanced or made me work faster and more effectively. But I'm
[00:35:20] here to tell you. And then it'll be interesting to have a conversation for our 10 years future
[00:35:27] cells. AI is not going to ever replace you. It's not going to replace me. Yeah, could it replace
[00:35:32] certain jobs, the people that did property descriptions or, you know, some of the video editors that,
[00:35:38] now you could take still videos and make it, yeah, yeah, so you can do a lot of that stuff. But at
[00:35:42] the end of the day, I think it's going to make humans more valuable. Like, I think a piece of art
[00:35:48] that someone did a painting by a human versus like an AI generated piece of art is going to be way
[00:35:54] more valuable or a song that was actually written by a real musician versus an AI band or AI,
[00:35:59] you know, persona or an actor, actress that I've heard some crazy stuff like they have,
[00:36:05] you know, AI actresses and actors now. Like, I don't want to watch some robot fake it out. I want
[00:36:10] to see the real person do it. Yeah, I know there's been proven by psychologist over and over and
[00:36:16] over again. And I don't know that it's exactly an apples to apples sort of comparison. But there is
[00:36:24] it's funny. People devalue things that they perceive as free. They they, even if they're super
[00:36:30] high quality. And again, AI is kind of an example of that. And yes, AI is can be super high quality.
[00:36:36] And it's also kind of free. And it's it's not valued the same as even something you pay a dollar
[00:36:42] for. It's it's it's it's it's remarkably different. So you're right. I don't think, you know,
[00:36:49] music, it's it's it's in trouble because they can create its own music now. Like music can just
[00:36:55] create its own music. And we can listen to it. But we're not going to appreciate it the way we
[00:37:00] appreciate when an artist actually, you know, puts puts their own work into it. And I think I think
[00:37:07] you're right. That authenticity is what we all actually desire. So whether it's art or or,
[00:37:12] you know, paintings or or music or anything television film, I don't want to watch a fake
[00:37:18] Meryl Street. I want to watch the real Meryl Street. 100% and that's why when people are working
[00:37:22] with a person that's enhanced with AI that makes me helps me do my job better and more effectively.
[00:37:29] That's the winner. But I think that it's going to be become more valuable to have the
[00:37:35] that relationship and focusing on that relationship and keeping those relationships because
[00:37:40] nobody can take that away from you. And you and I can go and make the most incredible AI spouse
[00:37:44] in the planet that will she will do anything and everything we want her to do or it or her or him.
[00:37:50] And it will literally be the perfect spouse. So we won't talk back. We won't tell me to do the
[00:37:55] dishes. Won't yell at me when I'm being stupid. And at the end of the day, I'm going to feel
[00:37:59] really super empty because even though it performed perfectly, that it's just not that same person,
[00:38:08] you know, that sold us all contact, you know. I had a very wise person once tell me,
[00:38:13] and this is pre-AI, but he said, because I would bring my dog to I had this little trowel,
[00:38:19] and I would just bring bring her everywhere. And so he once said to me, he's much older and
[00:38:25] wiser and he's passed away now, but he said something of a so brilliant. He said, do you love your
[00:38:29] dog? I said, yeah, does your dog love you? I guess so, you know, whatever. And he would say,
[00:38:33] is it a fulfilling relationship you and your dog? And I thought about it and I went, no, it's really
[00:38:38] not. He goes, do you know why that is? And I said, no, he goes, because there's no risk. She can't
[00:38:43] leave you. The dog's never going to leave. And he said, he said, that's why relationships are so
[00:38:49] important because there's risk. And he said, that's why it's so important to have relationships because
[00:38:54] there's something at stake. And you're right, we could build these fake girlfriends or fake wives or
[00:39:00] or, you know, these AI assistants. And that's great. And they, there's things that can be useful there.
[00:39:06] But to have it replace an actual human relationship is, is you right, it's empty, it's hollow,
[00:39:11] it is not, it is not going to give us a feeling of actual connection. So I love that you said,
[00:39:17] there's something at stake. Is that so true? Because look, our whole lives look, we wake up,
[00:39:21] we're born and we die. And we pay taxes. And that's pretty much the only variable. Anything else can
[00:39:26] happen in between, right? But we know those variables are going to happen. But you know,
[00:39:31] but you know, something at stake, yeah, something that invokes change or something at risk are the
[00:39:38] things that you value the most, right? What makes it exciting? If I sit down and I just got back from
[00:39:42] Vegas and I'm like, Hey, I know I'm going to walk away with a thousand dollars from this bet. It's
[00:39:51] sitting there freaking out. And when you win, it makes it so much exciting because there was
[00:39:55] something at stake. So I 100% agree. I love that you said that. I actually wrote that down. So
[00:40:01] well, I do not mean any disrespect to any other pet owners. I have two cats. I love my cats. And
[00:40:08] they love me the best they can. But you're right. He's right. They can't really leave. And so
[00:40:14] as a result, but humans can and sometimes do. And that's where you have to keep those relationships.
[00:40:21] And it's really no different from clients. Clients can leave. Clients can take off. And if you don't
[00:40:25] you know, maintain those relationships, they will. And so it's that's that's where the, you know,
[00:40:30] because you're putting in hard work then. And the hard work is like going to the gym. It's not
[00:40:34] the muscles in the mirror. It's the hard work that that is really what builds the character. Because
[00:40:40] you're right. It's like, then result is just the end result either you get the muscles or the
[00:40:44] whatever or you don't. But I've also found, I don't know if you would agree with this. But I found
[00:40:50] that when I have achieved goals, it's been so surprising to me in my life. Big goals that it's
[00:40:55] often super depressing, like immediately after. And I was like one of the biggest surprises of my
[00:41:01] life is like, Oh, I thought I wanted the thing is like, no, I didn't want the thing. I just wanted
[00:41:05] that all the work it takes to get to the thing. You know, it's interesting. You say that because
[00:41:10] what happens is that's a self-sabotaging subconscious thing that actually happens. So if you learn to
[00:41:18] enjoy the journey on the way, that's really that's the result. Right. And a lot of stuff happens in
[00:41:23] that journey. And later on in life, you find out it was like, Oh, it was the whole path there. It
[00:41:28] wasn't getting there because subconsciously, you don't really want to get there because then you
[00:41:32] stand up the summit by yourself and you're like, shit, now what? You know, and a lot of people don't
[00:41:38] get to the summit because they subconsciously sabotage themselves from getting there because they
[00:41:42] don't really want to go there. You know, but if you can get kind of get back to, yeah, I'm going to
[00:41:47] hit that summit. I'm going to turn back around and hit that summit. Then I'm going to hit that.
[00:41:50] Just keep going. Yeah. And you just keep going. Then you're not sitting yourself with a, I hate
[00:41:56] putting benchmarks. I was like, how many person teams do you want to get to? What dollar amount? I'm
[00:42:00] like, I don't know. I'm just surfing the wave. Whatever feels good. But it doesn't feel good. I'll
[00:42:05] scale back and adjust, but I'm never going to put a number or anything on everything because the
[00:42:10] number is infinite. I don't know. I'm just going to let it go. Right. And you don't know what the
[00:42:14] number is and what matters is the all the work it takes to get to the number and that's the journey.
[00:42:21] And you're you're so right. I always think about direction versus goal. Like I just, I'm heading in
[00:42:26] this direction. And yes, there's markers along the way. And I have to obviously maintain my finances
[00:42:31] and make sure I'm not, you know, I'm doing things in a responsible manner. But I'm really not looking
[00:42:37] for the thing because I know the thing itself is oftentimes not the thing. It's just the direction
[00:42:44] because like, okay, so let's say I want to get, you know, perfect six six pack abs. Like, okay,
[00:42:49] that's possible. I guess. And I could do all the work. And then it's like, who can you know,
[00:42:53] then I get to it. And it's like, all right. Now what's next? Like, I just, I just, yeah. But
[00:43:00] then it's like, Oh, no, I have to keep working out for the rest of my life. If I want to maintain
[00:43:05] that thing. And it's like, Oh, that's the reason to do it. Because that can maybe I live longer if
[00:43:10] I like, if I have a stronger body, like that's the reason to do it. And so it's like, okay, so then
[00:43:15] it's not the thing. Because if I just want to live longer, have a more comfortable ride until the
[00:43:19] end, I better get to the gym. That's just kind of a non-negotiable, but it sucks to go to the gym.
[00:43:25] But that's what you have to do. So it's kind of just like get, you know, get yourself to do the hard
[00:43:30] thing, right? And just keep doing the hard thing. And the results kind of, you know, if you're
[00:43:36] paying attention, we'll sort of take care of themselves most of the time. Or you'll pivot and go do
[00:43:40] something else. And it'll figure it out. I think it's good to have benchmarks towards, you know,
[00:43:46] whatever a goal looks like. You know, the benchmarks are great. You know, the goal, I can't tell you
[00:43:51] every goal I've hit didn't look anything like I visualized in my head whatsoever. You know, never
[00:43:56] would have vision vision. Oh, I have a team here and we're doing X amount and there's X amount of
[00:44:00] agents. I didn't, I didn't sculpt that idea. It just kind of happened and went in that direction
[00:44:08] because it felt good. You know, it's like surfing. It's just like, you know, you hit a wave and it's
[00:44:13] awesome. You know, and sometimes you're waiting for the wave and sometimes it doesn't come that day.
[00:44:17] But eventually getting out there that makes that wave so much more epic because you went and
[00:44:22] froze your ass off and sitting in the middle of the ocean waiting for that wave to come in. And
[00:44:29] you were prepared for it because you just so earned to get on that wave and you just enjoy the ride
[00:44:34] so much better because you earned it. You know, yeah, um, it's just waiting for the wave to come in,
[00:44:38] right? I boy, it's you're right. And and we have no control over when the wave comes in. We just
[00:44:44] have the ability to paddle and get out there. Yeah. Yeah. You're, you're, is when you're there,
[00:44:49] and then it happens, it's awesome. You just have to show up. Just show up. It'll happen.
[00:44:54] You know, it half the agents on my team, it's like, man, if they just 80% of the time just showed up.
[00:44:59] Yeah. Amazing success. It was the ones that quit, the ones that stopped, the ones that pivoted,
[00:45:05] the ones that didn't stay consistent. Those are the ones that failed. And whether they're a better
[00:45:11] agent or I think the better agent is the one that showed up because those ones got the result,
[00:45:16] you know, regardless. And I have a lot of agents that show up that are newer that are outselling
[00:45:21] a lot of senior agents on the team because they're just showing up. That's it.
[00:45:26] You also, you like to build things and you were telling me about a tool that you're building to
[00:45:32] sort of become the mayor of your town. Can you speak to that a bit and let our audience know what
[00:45:37] you're working on? Sure. Sure. Yeah. It's a SaaS product. It's going to be coming releasing up
[00:45:41] pretty soon. So when we service our clients and everything, and this happens every time as soon
[00:45:46] as we close or in the process of closing or just existing clients on the way, everything is like,
[00:45:51] well, Jeff's around town. He knows it's going on. He knows a lot of people. What's your favorite
[00:45:56] restaurant or do you have a probate attorney or I need a cat or a dog walker or cat walker?
[00:46:02] A pet setter I should say. So we have this big and list, but you know, it's not, it's never perfect.
[00:46:10] It's never in a perfect list. And I just get, you know, everybody calling for everything. So
[00:46:15] what we did is we found a way to find, to be the local mayor. There's only one mayor.
[00:46:21] So there's exclusivity to it, right? I can't have local 10 mayors.
[00:46:25] And basically you go, it finds all the local businesses, finds out who's the four and a half
[00:46:30] star or five star, whatever rating you want. Make sure they don't have any crappy, better,
[00:46:33] better business bureau ratings. Think of it as it just scoops it all up, serves it to you
[00:46:39] within appointment. And magically on Tuesdays and Thursdays, between two and five o'clock,
[00:46:44] they're sitting in your calendar ready to talk to you because they want to be part of your
[00:46:48] registry to get introduced to your whole database and people. Because that's what they really want.
[00:46:53] They want customers. And I want customers too. So basically, and in nutshell, this reaches out to
[00:47:00] them and say, Hey, I just want to put you part of the directory and promote you to a lot of my clients.
[00:47:07] The ones that don't show up think that we're trying to sell them something or trying to get a
[00:47:11] subscription or whatever. So I'll have to call, I'll have the A actually like, it's not AI calling,
[00:47:16] but it's we have this do. There's no work in Aiden's part except for just basically taking that
[00:47:22] appointment. And their first thing is how much is it cost? I mean, it doesn't cost anything.
[00:47:27] Cost you one referral a year. So think of everybody in your directory that you build up throughout
[00:47:32] the year, giving you one to three referrals a year because you're training into a huge,
[00:47:37] well, just do the math on it. If I have my medium price points of million and a half two million
[00:47:41] where I live or even just let's just call it a million, you have a hundred people in your service
[00:47:48] directory that you're sending out to all your existing clients anyway and referring, put them on
[00:47:52] your Instagram, putting them out there. By the way, that's the software does all this for you.
[00:47:56] It literally just posts blogs and and reels and social media posts all for you automatically.
[00:48:05] And sends it out to the client. The client sees that you're promoting this shit out of their
[00:48:09] business basically. It's probably tax the client as well. It does. It sends in an email and
[00:48:14] a summary and everything. So, you know, two, three months into it, they're like, oh,
[00:48:17] I owe this guy. He's totally promoting it. They're going to kick me off the system. I don't
[00:48:20] threaten anyone. I just said, just give me one referral a year. And it will gamify it. Two
[00:48:24] and it will remind you to remind people. And I don't mind asking those people for a for all. I'm not
[00:48:29] like some of the systems where, you know, I'm kindly, you know, reminding people, hey,
[00:48:35] by the way, they know I'm selling houses, you know, hey, by the way, if you know,
[00:48:39] if anybody that's buying or selling, just think of me, I hate that. I can't do it. So,
[00:48:45] this with just sending out and showing what I'm doing, promoting this to the database,
[00:48:50] they really feel like they owe you. So, let's just say if some people don't, you replace them.
[00:48:56] Just say, hey, look, this is for me to do all this stuff and promote you. And I love your services
[00:48:59] and all this stuff. But I really need you to promote some business back to me. That's it. It doesn't
[00:49:04] cost you anything. Just think, I know you meet 100 people a day. I'm sorry. I know that you have
[00:49:09] this big database of people that you're meeting not only daily, but all year, bring my name up.
[00:49:14] That's all I'm asking. And you can train people to refer you because basically they feel like they,
[00:49:21] you did something for them and that they owe you something. So they just magically automatically
[00:49:25] just kind of weirdly happens. So, if you have 100 people, let's say some people give you two or
[00:49:30] three and some people gave you none. Let's just say if you still got 100 referrals,
[00:49:34] well, instead of me paying for 40% for a little flex leader, instead of me paying a referral fee
[00:49:39] to another agent or me paying like as a lead service through getting a paper, click through
[00:49:46] YLOPO. If I have somebody saying, hey, my friend DJ wants to buy a house and give him a call. He
[00:49:54] said he wants to sell it or buy something next week or next year or thinking about selling
[00:50:00] and connects me. My closing ratio on those are way higher. Sure. You know, let's say if it's a
[00:50:05] five, like on a paper, a paper, click lead, it's like a 1% conversion realistically. Zillow has the
[00:50:11] best leads out there and that's like a 5 to 10%. If you're good. If you're good, these
[00:50:16] referrals, I'm at 50, 60%. Even I'm actually at 70% because when they come in, they come in as a
[00:50:24] referral. It doesn't come in as, you know, as I mentioned, a lot of them don't work out, but most of them do.
[00:50:30] So let's say if I get 75 deals, a million, that 75 million in sales right there and I didn't have
[00:50:34] to do anything except build my directory of local businesses that I also provide for my existing
[00:50:41] database every time they ask me for anything. And I should have that for my business anyway, right?
[00:50:47] And so that's basically what it does. It helps you build the directory and make a referral
[00:50:51] machine on steroids. Basically, I love that. So the problem we're solving for is
[00:50:56] REALTORS get asked by clients if they're good. Hey, I need a floor guy. I need xy or z for my, you know,
[00:51:05] some sort of answer, I think, for my real estate, whatever, or even an accountant or it could be
[00:51:09] anything. And REALTORS is I got the best person or I have a directory with all these great people.
[00:51:15] REALTOR then goes, finds the best accountant. It's a very arduous process because you got to build
[00:51:20] that manually. It just takes time. What you're doing is your system is going in and saying,
[00:51:24] here are the best people that we can find based on reviews in your area. And we're going to set
[00:51:28] up appointments with those service professionals and we're going to say, hey, let's develop a
[00:51:32] reciprocal relationship here. I'm going to send people to you. All I ask is you, you know,
[00:51:36] talk about me and if you ever hear anybody moving. And I, you know, and that's it. There's no
[00:51:40] cost. I'm going to promote you. I'm going to make content about you because I want everyone,
[00:51:44] all my followers on social and my email list to know about you, Mr. Dentist or whatever.
[00:51:51] And we are going to promote each other. And I'm going to tag you and we're just going to see
[00:51:56] what happens here. And essentially, this is going to build the whole infrastructure and do a lot
[00:52:02] of the actual setting up of even appointments with these providers so that you get to be able to,
[00:52:07] it's a B2B play. So what you're doing is you are setting up basically free advertising for
[00:52:13] these other small businesses who are only getting pitched by companies who want them to pay for
[00:52:19] advertising all day long. And you're like, oh, no, I'm a REALTOR. Like I have people asking me about
[00:52:23] this all the time and people moving this area and they don't have a dentist. They need a dentist.
[00:52:27] They need a vet. And you are now like, I want to promote your service. I know you're great.
[00:52:32] And let's figure out a way to do that. And then all I ask is that you think about me when people
[00:52:37] need a home assistance. Yeah. Exactly. And look, can anyone do this? Sure. Manually,
[00:52:42] think about what it would take to doing all the social media for this. Think about it. Would it
[00:52:47] take to arranging all these phone calls, digging in and finding these things? Just so we basically
[00:52:51] took everything and just made it so much easier for the agent that it's in their calendar. They
[00:52:56] didn't have to reach out to one person. All they had to do is build the directory online and say,
[00:53:00] okay, do I need this person? I already have this person that we put in. Let me try this.
[00:53:03] Sends out the information. Sets the appointment. Once you confirm you got those people automatically
[00:53:10] starts marketing them onto all your channels and the way we set it up. And your job is really just
[00:53:17] meeting these people, making relationships, calling them up every 60 days, 90 days to say hi,
[00:53:22] inviting them to events, whatever that looks like. And then just watching and seeing who's
[00:53:28] getting referrals or not. And it works. And I've tried, I have a team that I want to do this for.
[00:53:34] I didn't intentionally try to build this as a SaaS product, but I'm going to because I'm not as
[00:53:39] well. I went this far. But really just it gets somebody that even a brand new agent going, I don't
[00:53:46] have anybody in my database. I'm new to this area. I don't have 253, 300 people even start with.
[00:53:52] Well, how about you take this machine within 90 days. You'll have 100 people in your database.
[00:53:59] And you'll be having incredible conversations of which, by the way, it's like, oh, DJ's my dog
[00:54:04] walker, DJ, do you own a house? Yeah, he goes, let me give you a home market evaluation through
[00:54:07] real scout. And I'll put you on my regular email. So you can see that now I'm top of mind to DJ,
[00:54:12] not only as a client, but as a referring influencer, local micro influencer, no AI, nothing, nobody's
[00:54:21] ever going to take that away from me because I built my tribe. And good luck because I've already
[00:54:26] reciprocally, you know, did a very fair trade of business from introducing everybody to each other
[00:54:34] within each, you know, everybody's sphere from the business to the agent. Good luck trying to take
[00:54:41] that away. You know, they're going to feel obligated, you know, when is this going to be available for
[00:54:45] agents to subscribe to and then use it? I think it's going to be available next year. We're going to
[00:54:50] have some pilot betas for anybody that's interested. We will have some pilot betas that we're going to
[00:54:54] just invite a small handful of people, those that go on the beta version of it. We will give, you
[00:55:03] know, I'm going to price it at, but we'll give a discount for them to run it and to use it and
[00:55:10] to help finalize and work out the kinks of the product. We've worked, we've worked most of it out,
[00:55:14] but you know, in every area is a little bit different. So it's just more trying to geographically
[00:55:18] tune it. That's all. I love it. Well, what a way do you have a name for it yet?
[00:55:23] Local mayor.com. Local mayor.com. I love it. It's not up yet. You can look for it, but we don't have,
[00:55:33] or it's coming. Jeff, what a great conversation. I want to thank Jeff on behalf of our audience
[00:55:40] for he's a busy guy and he does hundreds of millions of dollars in business a year with he and his
[00:55:46] team. And he took time to really share his strategies and really his wisdom and his experience.
[00:55:52] And again, these podcasts are relationship driven as well. And we really, really honor you for
[00:55:58] coming on our show and giving up serving our audience out of the goodness of your heart. So we
[00:56:04] appreciate that. If you are an agent in the greater LA area and you want to work with Jeff and his
[00:56:10] team, of course, it doesn't work with everybody. So make a good pitch for yourself to figure out what
[00:56:14] you can add value to Jeff's team and reach out to him. Jeff B. Buck and we'll have his all of his
[00:56:20] in contact information is in our show notes. So reach out to him and his team. He does some really
[00:56:24] cool things and he's always looking for the next and greatest not only agent, but also opportunities
[00:56:31] in technology and just how to help make your business run more effectively and also just making
[00:56:36] sure the business runs. So he is going to be a great long time partner for you. So if you,
[00:56:41] and by the way, if you're an agent who is not in that area, but you have people that move into that
[00:56:46] area, you know, people that move into the luxury space or even the non-luxury space, you know,
[00:56:51] Jeff can if he can't assist you, he'll pass you off to an agent that he knows is good. But definitely
[00:56:56] reach out to him if you want to just partner up from different part of the country. Obviously, he has
[00:57:00] people that leave and travel elsewhere. And so on behalf of our audience, Jeff, thank you. And
[00:57:12] I have a Jeff, thank you to our audience. You guys are the reason we can keep doing these episodes.
[00:57:17] And I just ask one thing is to tell one other agent about this show. Just think of one other broker,
[00:57:23] or we call them brokers here. We'll say REALTOR. One other REALTOR that needs to hear what Jeff had
[00:57:28] to say. And that's basically any agent you know. Send them a link to our show or just tell them to
[00:57:32] download or sorry, subscribe to our podcast. And also whatever podcast app you're listening to us
[00:57:37] on, shoot us. Let us know what you think. We leave us a review that helps us get in front of more
[00:57:42] people as well. But please tell a friend we appreciate it. Thank you to our sponsors. Thank you to Jeff.
[00:57:46] Thanks to the audience. We will see everybody on the next episode. Thanks, Jeff.
[00:57:51] Thank you so much. Appreciate it, DJ. And again, I always appreciate these opportunities for you.

Well, what if I were to tell you there's a recruiting and retention tool powered by artificial intelligence that shows you exactly which agents in your local market are looking to leave their brokerage right now and which agents at your own firm are also looking to leave you? Now, I've been recruiting REALTORS for 15 years and I've hired over 2000 agents. I can tell you with no exaggeration, this is the tool I've been waiting for. Corded's AI looks for trends across dozens of variables for each agent in your market and shows you which agents they believe are likely to move. Not only does it do that, but corded's AI went and visited my recruiting website and read everything I offer. So now when I'm recruiting, corded's AI tells me exactly what to say based on that agent's needs and what my brokerage can offer. It even writes emails for me. I've never seen anything like it and I use it every single day. Now, if you are looking to grow your brokerage, corded.io is the best tool out there. Visit corded.io to schedule a demo again. That's corded.io. And now, onto the show. Hello and welcome to another episode of the Real The Largest Podcast, made by Real Estate Agent, seven years strong and over 700 episodes. I think we will ask out at some point. Anyway, I'm DJ Paris. I'm your guide and host through the show. Glad you're here. Welcome if you're new. And as always, the best way you can help us is to tell a friend. So let other people know about this show and then let us know what we can do to even make it better for you. And if you have somebody in your market where there's just like the super amazing top producer and you're like, how do they do that? Tell us who that person is. I will get them on the show and I will find out how they do that so you don't even have to. And that would be fun as well. In just a moment, I'm going to be speaking with top agent Jeff Bebuck. And this is a really fun interview because Jeff not only is a top amazing agent and he's really amazing. He works with celebrities and top business executives. And in top of that, he is also a super big tech guy. So he sits on boards for all of these AI tech companies, especially a lot of real estate tech companies. So he knows what's coming for us and he knows how to future proof your business so that you will still be relevant. So this is a great episode. It'll make you feel a lot better about the future and it'll tell you what to do in order to protect yourself and move forward. And also how to use some of these tools to your advantage to help rise above the competition. So let's just get right to it. My conversation with Jeff Bebuck. Best advice. Best advice. I got a lot of really bad advice. So I avoid the bad advice which in turn becomes the best advice I can. Honestly, I think the best advice I've gotten is from the mistakes I've learned because otherwise it wouldn't have been good advice to myself. I could take advice from anybody and everything and it's their experience, not mine. So I take advice from the, I wouldn't call them failures, but the lessons I've learned on the way. It sounds crazy. No, it's the only way we learn, right? So you're talking about the willingness to fail and fail in a sense of just not getting the outcome you desire and then going back. And it's of course how everything works, but it doesn't feel good in the moment. So it's like this. If it's hard and it sort of puts a pit in your stomach and you don't get what you want, it's just another opportunity to go back and do it again. You know, it's weird DJ2 is I think it's the perception of how you categorize failure. Yeah. So I'll look at something that failed and I believe me some of the mistakes I've made. There was like a big price tag to it or time and times worth more than money. But as I got drugged on the rabbit hole and let's say I was up, this just happened. $40,000, $50,000 in six months of my time where I had to step back and say, stop it. You're just trying to win and you're eating a square peg in a round hole. And what the hell are you doing this for? And I had to step back and become aware and almost kind of float above it and just kind of watch myself as a spectator and go, okay, idiot, what are you doing? Let's just start over here and let's unwire this thing and let's not get mad at herself because when we bring in all that bad stuff is the perception of making a mistake, your ego or whatever gets hit. And you have to step away from it. And if you can successfully step away and go, thank you for the lesson. Yeah, I was really pushing on that and I was wrong. And I literally put it on a shelf. My mom called it, my not to be religious, and I think my mom called it Jesus, take the wheel, right? She's like, let God figure it out or the universe, whatever. So I learned how to put this in this universal shelf of like whoever's out there, go figure this out, not to be too woo or anything. But what it does is it just takes it out of your brain and puts it in another place. And then this thing called faith of knowing that the answer will be downloaded to you in the morning. And I wake up with a fricking answer every time. Don't work from, I don't know. But you're not alone in that experience. So what I heard is a lot of what is what is mindfulness. And it's funny, mindfulness is a word that gets thrown around a lot. And the way that I understand it and the way that I've started to develop it, and it's really difficult, but it's sort of the pinging back and forth between first person experience. You know, I'm Jeff having this major challenge and I'm sinking all this cost into this time and time into this project that isn't working. But I can figure it out. I know I can do it. And then, you know, not maybe seeing it so objectively and rationally. And then having to be able to go to third person, which is kind of what you were saying, you know, floating above and saying, wait a minute, the wiser, smarter, Jeff or the universe can take a better, more accurate look at this and say, what's going on here? Same thing with emotions, right? We can have this incredibly challenging, immediate reaction to something. And then if we float above and look at ourselves in third person and say, oh, he's upset because, you know, his, you know, he didn't get what he needed as a child. He's running this pattern. That's just what he does. It's what his brain does. Okay, that's okay. He doesn't realize he's doing it. I'm going to go back into his brain and kind of tell him you don't have to do that right now. So I'm with you. I think what you just are talking about is mindfulness, which is one of the most useful skills I didn't know how useful it was until I started learning how to actually do it. And it took years. And I'm not, I still struggle with it. But it's this idea of being able to watch myself in real time doing something and going, oh, DJ's doing this thing that doesn't make a lot of sense. And we can possibly, you know, change it or I'm going to turn it over like you did release control, which is the hardest thing to do. And just assume that it's going to get worked out like something will figure this out. And like you said, maybe even throwing it into the ether and waking up with the answer. So I love that. You know, I'm sorry for talking so much about this, but I think it is such a powerful thing. It's like intuition almost. Yeah, we're asking advice from your higher self. So you're really asking advice from someone, but you're actually asking it from the experiences. And so if you didn't have those stepping stones of what you want to call a mistake, I don't call them the stakes. I just, you know, I, I fail up. And if they want to know how much they cost and asking your forgiveness for them or asking forgiveness to your business partner, hey, Dan, I just, my business partner. Yeah, I know he spent $40,000 and five months of just, I wouldn't call it wasted time, but look at the result. And now we're going to 10x wave and have a way better result because of that. And I just learned how to figure out how to get there faster by not beating myself up to the destination of what I thought that destination was. Because that destination comes back completely different almost every time. I'm like, wow, I never saw that angle. That's cool. So in being open to it, you know, that's really, that's really what I've learned in the last two years as a leader. You know, I worsted advice you've received. Don't listen to everybody else. Seriously, because at the end of the day, you're responsible for yourself. It's good to gather information. It's great to have mentors. It's great to take all that and absorb it and think about it and put that also on the shelf. Okay, I've collected all this data. You know, I've done some mistakes. I've got some great advice from other people. This is what they did. I'm going to put that in conjunction with everything else to get back to me to, you know, to come into play and figure out some kind of solution for it. You know, it's there. You just don't hear it. It's clouded with the promptors from self limiting beliefs that we've all created because that Darwinism thing in our brain that is protected us at one point in time for, you know, Hey, man, I can't admit I made a mistake because it would show weakness or hey, man, I can't do this because of that. Any of these little, you know, I call it monkey brain. And the monkey brain is always those little things whispering you can't, you know, mommy and daddy issues, all that kind of stuff. You just got to step away from it and say that happened in the past. It protected me at the time. I'm going to take this old guard that served me and I'm going to upbring him from a soldier to a general and say don't do that shit again and you're not fighting anymore, right? And so you're really recruiting your new army of sages versus shitheads. The promptors you know that screwed you up in the past, you know. And then like we were talking about this before we started, but then just acting differently. Right. So it's like, yes, you you have these wounds. We all have wounds. We all have things that happened to us that weren't great. And once we're aware of those patterns, we can literally just act differently. You know, you could just be the person you want to be with the resources that you want. And you get different results when you just act as as if and it's not, it's not a lie, right? It's not, hey, I'm competent when I'm not because people will see that right away. But it's it's this I am going to become this person who has these resources who reacts differently, who does different behaviors. And then eventually the brain just goes, okay, I guess we're doing that now. And it figures it out. You just retrain your brain and then you get the dopamine hit from that going, oh, I like doing this stuff. You know, it's like the working out of socks every time you go, January 1st, I get a gym membership that I don't show up two months later. And I paid for, you know, a month and a half or maybe even two weeks of a whole year of a gym membership that I never showed up for. But I can't cancel it because I'll feel guilty because I am a loser. I didn't go work out, you know. But if you just walked in, I mean, just set your phone to like 5,000 to 6,000 steps a day, that's working out. And if you did that consistently, the results you'd get from going to the gym two weeks out of the year would be astronomically compounded interest results versus, you know, feeling bad about something that you attempted to do and failed, you know. Yeah. And then if you can't do it yourself, what I had to do for the gym and again, I use this, I talk about this a lot of the show and I apologize to our listeners who've heard me say it, but if you haven't and you're new, this was helpful for me. It's the expensive option. But it works for me as I couldn't get to the gym myself. I let myself off the hook. I just wouldn't go. And finally at 42, I said, I got to get a trainer because it's so expensive that I will definitely show up and I've been the trainer now six years. And it also forces me to make more money because I have to pay the trainer. And I know that the moment I can I can't afford it, I will stop. And I am like in really the best shape of my life and I've never missed. But, but you know, I pay for it, but it's that's what works for me. And so I had to like, you know, I had to try all these different things and it was like, oh, I just need to pay for it. And when I pay for it, I'll actually do it. And hopefully our listeners who are struggling with the gym, hopefully you don't have to do that because that's a really expensive way to do it. But whatever works works. So anyway, I am a big big believer and just keep trying different things until something works like you were saying. Jeff Beebook is our guest today.

Nice to meet you, DJ. Finally meet you, I should say because I was watching the show and it's like, oh yeah, Tim, that's a lovely person. Well, I think you and I have a lot of things in common and it's really cool to this is one of the best parts for me on this show is getting to meet people like you because I just, you know, I love being able to talk to people who are kind of at the forefront of not just this industry, but other industries. You know, you're a real you're a tech guy and you're also into marketing and you just have a lot of thoughts and I love people that have thoughts. So we're going to get into some of those thoughts. Let's first talk about your transition because you started in an entertainment, right? And then went into real estate. So how and why? I think it started first with, you know, I was in I was in bands. I traveled and you know, played out here in California, sunset strip, troubadour, all that kind of cool stuff, you know, I was a kid that was listening to Indochroid listening to early Van Halen and Kiss, you know, and laying in bed going, pretending I was in the show, you know, literally pretending, I don't know why it just happened and I was fascinated with it and I was pretending in my head, remember it laying in my bunk bed, my shared bedroom with my brother, having a rock concert listening to, you know, these bands and then getting all these cool magazines back there and they were talking about this LA thing and the sunset strip and, you know, where all these bands came from. And I kind of just, you know, I don't know if I even purposely did it, I just ramped about it so much of that I just ended up fast forward. I'm standing on the stage at the troubadour for show and I'm looking down at my boots going, wow Jim Morrison stood here, I'm like, oh crap, I'm done, this is, that's a bucket list, what's next? So same thing happened with real estate, it was, you know, not that I dreamt about, you know, oh god, I wish I was a big, huge, real estate agent and I, no, that was not a dream. But what happened was, is I bought a couple houses, my wife got pregnant with her first son, didn't know we were doing a bought a house, we go out for our first walk and we just realized it was like straight downhill and we couldn't walk to anything, you know, so we had to get in the car and drive and she looked at me and she's like, oh man, we screwed up, like, damn it. So, when in, did some little repairs to fix it up, you know, didn't realize that we were at the crux of starting to flip properties, but we fixed it up, my hard to realize that agent, um, did not do a good job, didn't answer my questions, I felt just kind of really like lost in the process and nervous and scared, first house, all this money, I'm like, oh my god, this is a huge life moment, you know, here's our first kid, if we screw this up, what happens? So we sell the house, we did very well with it, didn't really do, it was kind of like an accidental flip, and then I saw what the agent got paid and the money he made and what I got in return for it, and I'm like, screw that, I'm gonna go get a real estate license and not pay that guy again, you know, not realizing that I probably didn't have that good of an agent, you know, at the time, and then we flipped, I don't even know, it would not even purposely, but I think we've only lived in houses from 18 months to two years to, you know, for tax purposes or whatever, and did that 15, 20 times. Wow, and, you know, and I ended up getting the license kind of just to save the money, but then when I was doing that, since I came from the music industry, a couple of my buddies that could buy big houses, were like, hey dude, I trust you, sell me big house, I'm like, all right, and then I got the paycheck for that, and I'm for a $5 million deal, I was like, whoa, I can do this, and I even have to flip a house, maybe I should do both, and that's what happened, how we got into luxury, and that's how I got into investing in homes. Wow, and amazing, and so that's how you built your clientele, was through your own investing, and people seeing what you're doing, and saying, hey, he seems to know something, and it wasn't the traditional getting out there and kind of beating the pavement, and becoming the local guy, I guess. Yeah, I mean, that, and I've always been brutally just savagely honest with people, not even just people or agents on my team, but just even clients, and if they came to me, and I'm dealing with these, you know, higher end properties, and they ask me my opinion, I'm like, you know, I don't know, I never knew it this man, but I'll find out, and I will get the best answer possible, because I have connections to everybody and anybody that I need to find this answer. So, you know, I never tried to fake someone out to work with me for something that I wasn't, you know, what I was was brutally honest, and then I would get back to you with an answer, versus trying to keep that client engaged, and being, I wouldn't say fake about it, but giving him some advice that I wasn't exactly sure, and I'm sure we've all been in that position, before where you wanted to sound knowledgeable, you gave some advice, but then later on you found up like, well, shit, that was totally wrong, should I just not say anything, just let it ride, I don't know, you know, so that's my best advice for anybody, just be brutally honest, if you don't know the answer, I would, you know, do unto others, if some, if my accountant, my accountant doesn't know a lot of shit, you know, he does where he needs to know it, but if he needs to find something out, I trust him, because he goes, no, I don't know, I got to check on that, or if I have an attorney, I don't know, I got to check on that, I'm not expecting to answer that minute, I'm expecting an answer, but when he comes back to me with 15 different options, because he looked into it, I'm like, that's my guy, and you've got to be, you know, yeah, it's, it's getting to the information, I love that, that sort of attitude when you do meet a service person who goes, oh, that's a good question, I'm going to find out and get back to you, I look, they get excited even, like it's, it's, like, oh, this person's into their job, you know, and that's, that's what you want from anybody, who you're hiring. So I love that. What was the biggest sort of change for you, or the biggest surprise maybe, switching from music and entertainment to real estate? Like, are, are, are, are those worlds similar in any way, or are they different? You know, I mean, obviously, the content is different, but, but how are those worlds intersect? It was Getty Lee says and rushed like all the worlds and the stage and we're, we're merely players, right? I don't even think it's Getty Lee, I think it's Shakespeare, but it's true. I mean, it's just a different stage, you know, it's a different place to show up, it's a different place to perform, you know, it's a different place to build a tribe. So I always kind of looked at, and I'd never thought I'd have 60-age in team, or band, yeah, I look at it like this way, we went from doing local bars to Lala Pallusa to Coachella to, you know, getting it, you know, as the team gets bigger, there's more roadies, there's more road managers, there's more accountants, there's all this kind of stuff, and I, and I don't want to make it not fun anymore, you know, I want to be able to like, if I'm going on stage and being able to perform that all the chaos that happens behind as you grow bigger on this tour doesn't take the life out of that performance, meaning that the message I'm trying to do, whether it's a first time home buyer, an agent starting out on my team trying to build their career, I want to come into that fresh and full of energy and, and, and focus, so that doesn't get watered down because I just got too much other noise and I can't bother with you, because I think that's what takes away from a lot of artists, I think that takes away from almost anyone. So I really try to get that laser energy focus, like it was the first time, you know, and, and, and really focus on that versus getting it watered down to when you scale out too big, you just lose it, you know, I love that. So really trying to make sure that at the end of the day, the end, the end product, I guess, is, is a laser focused product and getting all of the background operational stuff sort of figured out and not letting it affect the performance, I guess, is, is 100% I got a call yesterday, I got really upset because what I promise I deliver and, and because it's not a person on my team's fault if we get too big, that it doesn't matter, right? So at one of my agents that was very important, she was getting her real estate career back on track, which is why she joined my team, right? And I'm getting pages of partner to perform, so if she comes on, and for whatever reason, something didn't happen, it just listed just sold, it could be mean-eal stuff, like who gives a shit, right? I don't know if someone didn't see her post that nobody's looking at, you know, your page because you don't have enough followers anyway, but it mattered to her. And it could, and that right person might have seen it regardless of the size of that, so it could have been frivolous, but for me personally, I was like, hey, why didn't that happen? And that's what I promised and I had to go back to my team and go, guys, figure out where this broke and I never wanted to happen again because you are affecting my relationship with this client, because they're going to lose trust for me because I promised them something. And that upset me more than anything this week. And I went to the Zillow Convention. So that's bad. Not the Zillow Convention, but I mean, the fact that that bothered me more means that I'm laser focused on serving the agent on my team and their client and their performance versus this big ecosystem of like Zillow, you know, tying it into my team and doing the sales. That's more important to me. Yeah, no, it's expecting a high level of service, right? And so that's, I think those are good things to get upset about, you know, in a reasonable way, right? So, yeah, we could certainly, I found that the top agents and had a lot of the nation's top agents on the show and people like yourself who they just expect more. They just sort of go, I just got to sort of do a little better than everybody else. And it doesn't necessarily even mean work harder, although that usually is part of it. But it's part of this like level of standard. It's like, we're just going to raise our standards. We're going to be the Ritz Carlton, as opposed to, you know, a look into, and there's nothing wrong with being a look into if that's if that's your market. But if you want to play in a different, you know, type of arena, you have to show up a little differently. And so I totally, totally agree with that and having those standards well defined and expecting that from the team makes sense. And we should also mention, by the way, and Jeff has an amazing team. He has 60 people and he's with Compass, a great company, and he is always looking for more talent. Just, you know, I'm a recruiter. I know that, that as well. So if you are somebody who is in the, you know, the sort of that area of the country and you are maybe independent or maybe you're on a team yourself and you're not getting what you need, maybe you're not getting the direction or the tools are the support and you're looking to see what other teams provide and what you can offer a team. I would encourage you to reach out to Jeff. What's the best way another agent if they want to connect with you? How should they do that? Thank you. Just go on Frank8realistate.com in the top. It says join the team and all the information is on there about what we offer, what we do, the surface level of it, and then it's just connecting with me. Yeah. And we just kind of look at each agent that comes on the team individually. Everybody's different, man. Everyone has superpowers and everyone has crypto tonight. I'm not going to try to force someone to become better like Superman, kryptonite's kryptonite. It's going to hurt you. It's not going to ever help. The best thing you can do is get it away and focus on the super power. So that's what we do. So if an agent has a kryptonite, why am I forcing? Use this. Do this. You have to learn to do that. If it doesn't feel comfortable, don't do it. There's a way. If there's a will, there's a way we find out what that way is because the will is already there and then we just 10X that and take the kryptonite away. That's our superpowers. The team because that's what I realized that I hate forcing anything. I'm not a stick guy. I'm a carrot guy. And I like carrots better than sticks. Who doesn't? Yeah. And not every team works that way. There are some teams that are stick focused. And that works for them. But yeah, I'm the, I absolutely feel the same way. And I think most agents probably do. So when you have top top performing team members and you know part of your job, I guess, is the team lead is to keep them motivated. And I think it sounds like you do that by really recognizing their individual goals and talents and really kind of leaning and going, let me help you solve this. We'll find, because it's all about solving problems. And that's what you're really just a master problem solver. And by doing that, you're going to enable your team to succeed. So I am curious. I want to switch gears just a little bit because I want to talk about market dynamics because we are the markets. Obviously, it's kind of an unusual place and it depends where market you're in. But on the west coast, I'm curious to get your thoughts. But you know, Zillow, you were just out with Zillow. So I have been to some of those Zillow events as well. And I love it. I have a great relationship with people at Zillow. And they always have interesting insights with the data that they have. And a lot of it's stuff that isn't super intuitive. So I'm curious, what are you seeing out there and what are you thinking about as sort of for the future? Well, everybody's going to have their own micro community area level of things that happened. For instance, where we're at, you know, we have these Wolsey fires before the LA Pacific Palisades fires. Wolsey fires are right in our backyard. This house, this room I'm sitting in right now is evacuated from this house twice. So what's happening, and it's happening across the country, you know, Florida with floods, Texas with storms, I mean, you name it at California with fires. But I just, we just closed the house down and I did. There was an $8 million newer construction. It was almost through $280,000 a year premium. Wow. 288, that's due to the math, 27ish through 26,000 a month for insurance. Wow. So and for a million dollar house, it could be 20,000 to 30,000, depending where it's at. So we're in a severe fire zone. So that basically really is brought our market down to almost 60, 65%, which is catastrophic. Yeah, especially in the high end too, because it was that much more affordable. But it's irrelevant. If it's a million dollar house or 10 million, it's going to be that same level of you double or triple the insurance, you're going to have that same problem basically. So insurability became an issue with affordability. And then you got the interest rates and all that kind of stuff. So we've seen a massive, you know, shift in our market. But we diversified. One great thing about Zillow is Zillow honestly kind of helps save our team. You know, yes, there's hefty fees when you're on a Zillow flex. But having said that, we were able to diversify spread out across all of greater Los Angeles into different markets where we didn't even think about going before because we're, you know, a luxury, you know, brand that was like hyper focused on a certain area. And, you know, 60 agents and, you know, we, I think we did 100 million was Zillow last year. It really helped. I don't even know, you know, very good possibility. You might not have been there with that, you know, with that situation. So that was a blessing and that worked out well. But I think from a macro level, from what I've heard and from incredible conversations I've had with, you know, top team leaders. I mean, I've talked a rubber, you know, Reffkin with Compass personally all the time, speaking with very higher up at Zillow. You just hear kind of where the market's shifting, what's going on. I really feel and they feel like we really hit the bottom August was probably the crappiest year of real estate in the last 30 years, you know, this last August. So what their predictions are is that, you know, everyone's going to have different hyper local situations. But, you know, we're going to hum along here and it's going to be a little bit more steadier and it's not going to be this volatile up and down where we're going to just going to see a nice flattening to a gradual, you know, new normal. What that normal looks like, well, it's not going to be the unicorn years of what happened, you know, right up with COVID. And I think I think the volatility is going to be a little bit more removed for the market to not have those epic spikes and values, which I'll take because try to run a business on that. I'm like, God, I mean, we all know that, you know, that our pay for the last two years. So you had a massive change because I, yeah, I wasn't even thinking about the insurability issue. Yeah, you got hit hard because of course, that just, just pull so many people out of that, that geographic area because it just doesn't make sense anymore. And you guys, you guys pivoted, which is really amazing. And obviously, something you, you probably, you know, had to do and did it and we're successful at that. I always think it's so cool when you talk to people who really understand running their business like a business because challenges happen. We've had it here at our firm, our version of what happened to you. And yeah, you would literally have to pivot. And then you're just like, oh, you just kind of take that same skill set and apply it elsewhere. And, you know, you figure out a solution. So cheer my hats off to you because I think I'm probably a lot of agents who were in that space, probably just, it was probably super depressing. And they probably didn't pivot as much as maybe they should have or as much as you did. And I think that's just incredible. So again, another reason to consider joining Jeff's team is, you know, they are going to make changes. They're not the battleship in the bathtub. They can, they can pivot when they need to. And that is something that great teams do. And, you know, other teams, you know, move all behind you. I'm curious, what do you think's going to happen? Because AIs here, of course, and we're all using it to some degree, at least to rewrite our listing descriptions. But we should be using it for much more than that. And in fact, if you're going to use it to write your, rewrite your listing descriptions, at least do a good job of writing a prompt to get a good listing description. But I don't think a lot of agents are even doing that. Just like copying, pasting it and, and hoping it rewrites it well. But, but again, yeah, I can do so much more. But what are you seeing? What do you think? Because you're a tech guy. Where do you think AIs, what do you think A is going to do to agents? Is it a net positive? Is it a net negative? What agents will be a fact did? What agents will be empowered? Sort of what are your thoughts there? Sure. I think it's all how you kind of look at it again. Because at the end of the day, you know, AIs, everyone, you know, scary, scary, scary. It's going to be like, you know, all those movies we've watched from what, like, from total recall, determinator to Iroh Bot, right? It was just like taking over the world and, you know, blowing us up. Yeah, I mean, it is fascinating that some of the stuff that we're able to do now is wow, that really helped me out. But, you know, it hallucinates a lot. Not everything's perfect. It's going to take a while for it to really to do that. But I think what's going to happen from what I'm seeing. And here's a perfect example. And I'm sure everybody listening right now knows exactly what I'm talking about, including yourself, DJs, that you get that phone call, right? And you hear that pause, you know, like, hello, hello. Ding is like, oh, hello, Jeff, how are you today? I mean, I can't hang up fast enough, you know, my reaction is like, foodie it, you know, click is like interrupted me, you know, right? And I don't think I've ever gotten through an A iPhone call. Me neither. I don't think anybody has because it's just, we don't want to talk to Rulow. We're talking. So having said that, you know, and our brains have now tuned into it very quickly. I get an email from someone I'm like, yeah, I use Chatchee BT. He doesn't talk like that myself too. I mean, I could put my email like, you know, if I wrote it, this was not written by Chatchee BT, you know, or if it was a laugh and go, yeah, yeah, that was that was the help of AI Jeff or whatever. But in its great for that, I love it. I just did 10 things today that enhanced or made me work faster and more effectively. But I'm here to tell you. And then it'll be interesting to have a conversation for our 10 years future cells. AI is not going to ever replace you. It's not going to replace me. Yeah, could it replace certain jobs, the people that did property descriptions or, you know, some of the video editors that, now you could take still videos and make it, yeah, yeah, so you can do a lot of that stuff. But at the end of the day, I think it's going to make humans more valuable. Like, I think a piece of art that someone did a painting by a human versus like an AI generated piece of art is going to be way more valuable or a song that was actually written by a real musician versus an AI band or AI, you know, persona or an actor, actress that I've heard some crazy stuff like they have, you know, AI actresses and actors now. Like, I don't want to watch some robot fake it out. I want to see the real person do it. Yeah, I know there's been proven by psychologist over and over and over again. And I don't know that it's exactly an apples to apples sort of comparison. But there is it's funny. People devalue things that they perceive as free. They they, even if they're super high quality. And again, AI is kind of an example of that. And yes, AI is can be super high quality. And it's also kind of free. And it's it's not valued the same as even something you pay a dollar for. It's it's it's it's it's remarkably different. So you're right. I don't think, you know, music, it's it's it's in trouble because they can create its own music now. Like music can just create its own music. And we can listen to it. But we're not going to appreciate it the way we appreciate when an artist actually, you know, puts puts their own work into it. And I think I think you're right. That authenticity is what we all actually desire. So whether it's art or or, you know, paintings or or music or anything television film, I don't want to watch a fake Meryl Street. I want to watch the real Meryl Street. 100% and that's why when people are working with a person that's enhanced with AI that makes me helps me do my job better and more effectively. That's the winner. But I think that it's going to be become more valuable to have the that relationship and focusing on that relationship and keeping those relationships because nobody can take that away from you. And you and I can go and make the most incredible AI spouse in the planet that will she will do anything and everything we want her to do or it or her or him. And it will literally be the perfect spouse. So we won't talk back. We won't tell me to do the dishes. Won't yell at me when I'm being stupid. And at the end of the day, I'm going to feel really super empty because even though it performed perfectly, that it's just not that same person, you know, that sold us all contact, you know. I had a very wise person once tell me, and this is pre-AI, but he said, because I would bring my dog to I had this little trowel, and I would just bring bring her everywhere. And so he once said to me, he's much older and wiser and he's passed away now, but he said something of a so brilliant. He said, do you love your dog? I said, yeah, does your dog love you? I guess so, you know, whatever. And he would say, is it a fulfilling relationship you and your dog? And I thought about it and I went, no, it's really not. He goes, do you know why that is? And I said, no, he goes, because there's no risk. She can't leave you. The dog's never going to leave. And he said, he said, that's why relationships are so important because there's risk. And he said, that's why it's so important to have relationships because there's something at stake. And you're right, we could build these fake girlfriends or fake wives or or, you know, these AI assistants. And that's great. And they, there's things that can be useful there. But to have it replace an actual human relationship is, is you right, it's empty, it's hollow, it is not, it is not going to give us a feeling of actual connection. So I love that you said, there's something at stake. Is that so true? Because look, our whole lives look, we wake up, we're born and we die. And we pay taxes. And that's pretty much the only variable. Anything else can happen in between, right? But we know those variables are going to happen. But you know, but you know, something at stake, yeah, something that invokes change or something at risk are the things that you value the most, right? What makes it exciting? If I sit down and I just got back from Vegas and I'm like, Hey, I know I'm going to walk away with a thousand dollars from this bet. It's sitting there freaking out. And when you win, it makes it so much exciting because there was something at stake. So I 100% agree. I love that you said that. I actually wrote that down. So well, I do not mean any disrespect to any other pet owners. I have two cats. I love my cats. And they love me the best they can. But you're right. He's right. They can't really leave. And so as a result, but humans can and sometimes do. And that's where you have to keep those relationships. And it's really no different from clients. Clients can leave. Clients can take off. And if you don't you know, maintain those relationships, they will. And so it's that's that's where the, you know, because you're putting in hard work then. And the hard work is like going to the gym. It's not the muscles in the mirror. It's the hard work that that is really what builds the character. Because you're right. It's like, then result is just the end result either you get the muscles or the whatever or you don't. But I've also found, I don't know if you would agree with this. But I found that when I have achieved goals, it's been so surprising to me in my life. Big goals that it's often super depressing, like immediately after. And I was like one of the biggest surprises of my life is like, Oh, I thought I wanted the thing is like, no, I didn't want the thing. I just wanted that all the work it takes to get to the thing. You know, it's interesting. You say that because what happens is that's a self-sabotaging subconscious thing that actually happens. So if you learn to enjoy the journey on the way, that's really that's the result. Right. And a lot of stuff happens in that journey. And later on in life, you find out it was like, Oh, it was the whole path there. It wasn't getting there because subconsciously, you don't really want to get there because then you stand up the summit by yourself and you're like, shit, now what? You know, and a lot of people don't get to the summit because they subconsciously sabotage themselves from getting there because they don't really want to go there. You know, but if you can get kind of get back to, yeah, I'm going to hit that summit. I'm going to turn back around and hit that summit. Then I'm going to hit that. Just keep going. Yeah. And you just keep going. Then you're not sitting yourself with a, I hate putting benchmarks. I was like, how many person teams do you want to get to? What dollar amount? I'm like, I don't know. I'm just surfing the wave. Whatever feels good. But it doesn't feel good. I'll scale back and adjust, but I'm never going to put a number or anything on everything because the number is infinite. I don't know. I'm just going to let it go. Right. And you don't know what the number is and what matters is the all the work it takes to get to the number and that's the journey. And you're you're so right. I always think about direction versus goal. Like I just, I'm heading in this direction. And yes, there's markers along the way. And I have to obviously maintain my finances and make sure I'm not, you know, I'm doing things in a responsible manner. But I'm really not looking for the thing because I know the thing itself is oftentimes not the thing. It's just the direction because like, okay, so let's say I want to get, you know, perfect six six pack abs. Like, okay, that's possible. I guess. And I could do all the work. And then it's like, who can you know, then I get to it. And it's like, all right. Now what's next? Like, I just, I just, yeah. But then it's like, Oh, no, I have to keep working out for the rest of my life. If I want to maintain that thing. And it's like, Oh, that's the reason to do it. Because that can maybe I live longer if I like, if I have a stronger body, like that's the reason to do it. And so it's like, okay, so then it's not the thing. Because if I just want to live longer, have a more comfortable ride until the end, I better get to the gym. That's just kind of a non-negotiable, but it sucks to go to the gym. But that's what you have to do. So it's kind of just like get, you know, get yourself to do the hard thing, right? And just keep doing the hard thing. And the results kind of, you know, if you're paying attention, we'll sort of take care of themselves most of the time. Or you'll pivot and go do something else. And it'll figure it out. I think it's good to have benchmarks towards, you know, whatever a goal looks like. You know, the benchmarks are great. You know, the goal, I can't tell you every goal I've hit didn't look anything like I visualized in my head whatsoever. You know, never would have vision vision. Oh, I have a team here and we're doing X amount and there's X amount of agents. I didn't, I didn't sculpt that idea. It just kind of happened and went in that direction because it felt good. You know, it's like surfing. It's just like, you know, you hit a wave and it's awesome. You know, and sometimes you're waiting for the wave and sometimes it doesn't come that day. But eventually getting out there that makes that wave so much more epic because you went and froze your ass off and sitting in the middle of the ocean waiting for that wave to come in. And you were prepared for it because you just so earned to get on that wave and you just enjoy the ride so much better because you earned it. You know, yeah, um, it's just waiting for the wave to come in, right? I boy, it's you're right. And and we have no control over when the wave comes in. We just have the ability to paddle and get out there. Yeah. Yeah. You're, you're, is when you're there, and then it happens, it's awesome. You just have to show up. Just show up. It'll happen. You know, it half the agents on my team, it's like, man, if they just 80% of the time just showed up. Yeah. Amazing success. It was the ones that quit, the ones that stopped, the ones that pivoted, the ones that didn't stay consistent. Those are the ones that failed. And whether they're a better agent or I think the better agent is the one that showed up because those ones got the result, you know, regardless. And I have a lot of agents that show up that are newer that are outselling a lot of senior agents on the team because they're just showing up. That's it. You also, you like to build things and you were telling me about a tool that you're building to sort of become the mayor of your town. Can you speak to that a bit and let our audience know what you're working on? Sure. Sure. Yeah. It's a SaaS product. It's going to be coming releasing up pretty soon. So when we service our clients and everything, and this happens every time as soon as we close or in the process of closing or just existing clients on the way, everything is like, well, Jeff's around town. He knows it's going on. He knows a lot of people. What's your favorite restaurant or do you have a probate attorney or I need a cat or a dog walker or cat walker? A pet setter I should say. So we have this big and list, but you know, it's not, it's never perfect. It's never in a perfect list. And I just get, you know, everybody calling for everything. So what we did is we found a way to find, to be the local mayor. There's only one mayor. So there's exclusivity to it, right? I can't have local 10 mayors. And basically you go, it finds all the local businesses, finds out who's the four and a half star or five star, whatever rating you want. Make sure they don't have any crappy, better, better business bureau ratings. Think of it as it just scoops it all up, serves it to you within appointment. And magically on Tuesdays and Thursdays, between two and five o'clock, they're sitting in your calendar ready to talk to you because they want to be part of your registry to get introduced to your whole database and people. Because that's what they really want. They want customers. And I want customers too. So basically, and in nutshell, this reaches out to them and say, Hey, I just want to put you part of the directory and promote you to a lot of my clients. The ones that don't show up think that we're trying to sell them something or trying to get a subscription or whatever. So I'll have to call, I'll have the A actually like, it's not AI calling, but it's we have this do. There's no work in Aiden's part except for just basically taking that appointment. And their first thing is how much is it cost? I mean, it doesn't cost anything. Cost you one referral a year. So think of everybody in your directory that you build up throughout the year, giving you one to three referrals a year because you're training into a huge, well, just do the math on it. If I have my medium price points of million and a half two million where I live or even just let's just call it a million, you have a hundred people in your service directory that you're sending out to all your existing clients anyway and referring, put them on your Instagram, putting them out there. By the way, that's the software does all this for you. It literally just posts blogs and and reels and social media posts all for you automatically. And sends it out to the client. The client sees that you're promoting this shit out of their business basically. It's probably tax the client as well. It does. It sends in an email and a summary and everything. So, you know, two, three months into it, they're like, oh, I owe this guy. He's totally promoting it. They're going to kick me off the system. I don't threaten anyone. I just said, just give me one referral a year. And it will gamify it. Two and it will remind you to remind people. And I don't mind asking those people for a for all. I'm not like some of the systems where, you know, I'm kindly, you know, reminding people, hey, by the way, they know I'm selling houses, you know, hey, by the way, if you know, if anybody that's buying or selling, just think of me, I hate that. I can't do it. So, this with just sending out and showing what I'm doing, promoting this to the database, they really feel like they owe you. So, let's just say if some people don't, you replace them. Just say, hey, look, this is for me to do all this stuff and promote you. And I love your services and all this stuff. But I really need you to promote some business back to me. That's it. It doesn't cost you anything. Just think, I know you meet 100 people a day. I'm sorry. I know that you have this big database of people that you're meeting not only daily, but all year, bring my name up. That's all I'm asking. And you can train people to refer you because basically they feel like they, you did something for them and that they owe you something. So they just magically automatically just kind of weirdly happens. So, if you have 100 people, let's say some people give you two or three and some people gave you none. Let's just say if you still got 100 referrals, well, instead of me paying for 40% for a little flex leader, instead of me paying a referral fee to another agent or me paying like as a lead service through getting a paper, click through YLOPO. If I have somebody saying, hey, my friend DJ wants to buy a house and give him a call. He said he wants to sell it or buy something next week or next year or thinking about selling and connects me. My closing ratio on those are way higher. Sure. You know, let's say if it's a five, like on a paper, a paper, click lead, it's like a 1% conversion realistically. Zillow has the best leads out there and that's like a 5 to 10%. If you're good. If you're good, these referrals, I'm at 50, 60%. Even I'm actually at 70% because when they come in, they come in as a referral. It doesn't come in as, you know, as I mentioned, a lot of them don't work out, but most of them do. So let's say if I get 75 deals, a million, that 75 million in sales right there and I didn't have to do anything except build my directory of local businesses that I also provide for my existing database every time they ask me for anything. And I should have that for my business anyway, right? And so that's basically what it does. It helps you build the directory and make a referral machine on steroids. Basically, I love that. So the problem we're solving for is REALTORS get asked by clients if they're good. Hey, I need a floor guy. I need xy or z for my, you know, some sort of answer, I think, for my real estate, whatever, or even an accountant or it could be anything. And REALTORS is I got the best person or I have a directory with all these great people. REALTOR then goes, finds the best accountant. It's a very arduous process because you got to build that manually. It just takes time. What you're doing is your system is going in and saying, here are the best people that we can find based on reviews in your area. And we're going to set up appointments with those service professionals and we're going to say, hey, let's develop a reciprocal relationship here. I'm going to send people to you. All I ask is you, you know, talk about me and if you ever hear anybody moving. And I, you know, and that's it. There's no cost. I'm going to promote you. I'm going to make content about you because I want everyone, all my followers on social and my email list to know about you, Mr. Dentist or whatever. And we are going to promote each other. And I'm going to tag you and we're just going to see what happens here. And essentially, this is going to build the whole infrastructure and do a lot of the actual setting up of even appointments with these providers so that you get to be able to, it's a B2B play. So what you're doing is you are setting up basically free advertising for these other small businesses who are only getting pitched by companies who want them to pay for advertising all day long. And you're like, oh, no, I'm a REALTOR. Like I have people asking me about this all the time and people moving this area and they don't have a dentist. They need a dentist. They need a vet. And you are now like, I want to promote your service. I know you're great. And let's figure out a way to do that. And then all I ask is that you think about me when people need a home assistance. Yeah. Exactly. And look, can anyone do this? Sure. Manually, think about what it would take to doing all the social media for this. Think about it. Would it take to arranging all these phone calls, digging in and finding these things? Just so we basically took everything and just made it so much easier for the agent that it's in their calendar. They didn't have to reach out to one person. All they had to do is build the directory online and say, okay, do I need this person? I already have this person that we put in. Let me try this. Sends out the information. Sets the appointment. Once you confirm you got those people automatically starts marketing them onto all your channels and the way we set it up. And your job is really just meeting these people, making relationships, calling them up every 60 days, 90 days to say hi, inviting them to events, whatever that looks like. And then just watching and seeing who's getting referrals or not. And it works. And I've tried, I have a team that I want to do this for. I didn't intentionally try to build this as a SaaS product, but I'm going to because I'm not as well. I went this far. But really just it gets somebody that even a brand new agent going, I don't have anybody in my database. I'm new to this area. I don't have 253, 300 people even start with. Well, how about you take this machine within 90 days. You'll have 100 people in your database. And you'll be having incredible conversations of which, by the way, it's like, oh, DJ's my dog walker, DJ, do you own a house? Yeah, he goes, let me give you a home market evaluation through real scout. And I'll put you on my regular email. So you can see that now I'm top of mind to DJ, not only as a client, but as a referring influencer, local micro influencer, no AI, nothing, nobody's ever going to take that away from me because I built my tribe. And good luck because I've already reciprocally, you know, did a very fair trade of business from introducing everybody to each other within each, you know, everybody's sphere from the business to the agent. Good luck trying to take that away. You know, they're going to feel obligated, you know, when is this going to be available for agents to subscribe to and then use it? I think it's going to be available next year. We're going to have some pilot betas for anybody that's interested. We will have some pilot betas that we're going to just invite a small handful of people, those that go on the beta version of it. We will give, you know, I'm going to price it at, but we'll give a discount for them to run it and to use it and to help finalize and work out the kinks of the product. We've worked, we've worked most of it out, but you know, in every area is a little bit different. So it's just more trying to geographically tune it. That's all. I love it. Well, what a way do you have a name for it yet? Local mayor.com. Local mayor.com. I love it. It's not up yet. You can look for it, but we don't have, or it's coming. Jeff, what a great conversation. I want to thank Jeff on behalf of our audience for he's a busy guy and he does hundreds of millions of dollars in business a year with he and his team. And he took time to really share his strategies and really his wisdom and his experience. And again, these podcasts are relationship driven as well. And we really, really honor you for coming on our show and giving up serving our audience out of the goodness of your heart. So we appreciate that. If you are an agent in the greater LA area and you want to work with Jeff and his team, of course, it doesn't work with everybody. So make a good pitch for yourself to figure out what you can add value to Jeff's team and reach out to him. Jeff B. Buck and we'll have his all of his in contact information is in our show notes. So reach out to him and his team. He does some really cool things and he's always looking for the next and greatest not only agent, but also opportunities in technology and just how to help make your business run more effectively and also just making sure the business runs. So he is going to be a great long time partner for you. So if you, and by the way, if you're an agent who is not in that area, but you have people that move into that area, you know, people that move into the luxury space or even the non-luxury space, you know, Jeff can if he can't assist you, he'll pass you off to an agent that he knows is good. But definitely reach out to him if you want to just partner up from different part of the country. Obviously, he has people that leave and travel elsewhere. And so on behalf of our audience, Jeff, thank you. And I have a Jeff, thank you to our audience. You guys are the reason we can keep doing these episodes. And I just ask one thing is to tell one other agent about this show. Just think of one other broker, or we call them brokers here. We'll say REALTOR. One other REALTOR that needs to hear what Jeff had to say. And that's basically any agent you know. Send them a link to our show or just tell them to download or sorry, subscribe to our podcast. And also whatever podcast app you're listening to us on, shoot us. Let us know what you think. We leave us a review that helps us get in front of more people as well. But please tell a friend we appreciate it. Thank you to our sponsors. Thank you to Jeff. Thanks to the audience. We will see everybody on the next episode. Thanks, Jeff. Thank you so much. Appreciate it, DJ. And again, I always appreciate these opportunities for you.
