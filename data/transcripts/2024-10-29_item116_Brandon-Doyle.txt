[00:02:38] My conversation with Brandon Doyle.
[00:02:54] Today on the show, my guest is Brandon Doyle from the Doyle real estate team with RE/MAX
[00:03:00] results in Minneapolis, Minnesota.
[00:03:02] Let me tell you more about Brandon.
[00:03:04] This is Brandon.
[00:03:05] I'm so excited about Brandon because this is really right up my alley and he is an expert
[00:03:11] in the things that I'm interested in.
[00:03:13] But let me tell you more about him.
[00:03:14] So Brandon Doyle has a bachelor's of science from St. Cloud State University, which was
[00:03:19] a real estate major.
[00:03:20] He also has a master of science real estate degree from the University of St. Thomas.
[00:03:25] He previously served on the Minnesota REALTOR Board of Directors as an appointee for several
[00:03:30] years and he is a past president of the St. Cloud State Real Estate Alumni Association.
[00:03:36] Brandon has been nominated as Inman's Innovative REALTOR of the Year 2014.
[00:03:40] He's been featured in many magazines and newspapers, really talking about the cutting edge
[00:03:45] of technology in the real estate industry.
[00:03:48] Brandon is also listed on Inman News as one of the most influential people in real estate
[00:03:53] for 2017 and is recognized as a rising young professional by finance and commerce in 2020.
[00:04:00] And I left out about 20 other things that he has accomplished.
[00:04:03] But in the interest of time, I want to bring him on.
[00:04:06] Brandon Doyle is our guest.
[00:04:07] And I want everybody to check out his YouTube channel, which is DIY smart Brandon.
[00:04:14] I'm so sorry, DIY smart.
[00:04:15] So we have a podcast and the podcast is on DIY smart home guy.
[00:04:20] But I also have my own channel as well, which is just Brandon Doyle.
[00:04:24] Amen.
[00:04:25] Got it.
[00:04:26] Actually several channels, but those are the two big ones where you can find me.
[00:04:29] If you're interested in smart home technology, awesome.
[00:04:32] And DIY smart home guy is where you find that on YouTube.
[00:04:35] I will have a link to that.
[00:04:36] He has a healthy subscriber base there.
[00:04:39] He's got really well-produced videos.
[00:04:41] Check it out.
[00:04:41] We'll have a link directly to that in the show notes.
[00:04:44] And if you're somebody that's looking for a REALTOR in the Minneapolis area,
[00:04:48] Doyle real estate team is the team to go with.
[00:04:51] And we'll have a link to their website as well.
[00:04:53] We'll have a link to all of Brandon's socials on the show notes.
[00:04:58] So Brandon, welcome to the show.
[00:05:00] Well, thanks for having me.
[00:05:02] I'm a little intimidated.
[00:05:03] I have to be honest.
[00:05:04] Because I rarely get to talk to, I talk to a lot of top 1% producers all over the country.
[00:05:10] That part doesn't intimidate me.
[00:05:13] But the fact that you are really, really tied in to technology is really exciting for me.
[00:05:20] I'm so glad that we were able to connect because this is a conversation that I would love to have had
[00:05:25] all throughout the years of doing the show.
[00:05:27] And I really haven't.
[00:05:28] So I'm excited to have it with you.
[00:05:30] But I'd love to tell our audience a little bit more about how you got started.
[00:05:35] I know you worked on a team with your father, which is awesome.
[00:05:39] So I know that that's part of the story.
[00:05:41] But you really were in real estate all the way back into college.
[00:05:45] You knew that was kind of a path for you.
[00:05:48] So I'd love to find out, how did you decide to go into real estate?
[00:05:51] And what did that look like for you?
[00:05:53] Yeah, it's my own little cliche.
[00:05:55] But growing up, I was destined not to do real estate.
[00:05:58] Because my dad was working the nights and weekends and missing sporting events.
[00:06:04] And I was like, I would never do that.
[00:06:06] And then fast forward.
[00:06:08] Here I am on a team with him.
[00:06:10] But I did go to college for real estate.
[00:06:13] So I have a bachelor's degree.
[00:06:16] And it's more of commercial real estate focus.
[00:06:18] And then I did go back and get my masters as well, also in real estate.
[00:06:21] So two degrees that absolutely do nothing in the world of residential sales.
[00:06:25] But really good for networking and understanding things beyond just the day to day.
[00:06:31] Yeah.
[00:06:33] And when you got started, did you immediately start with your dad or did you start on your own?
[00:06:37] And you guys came together later?
[00:06:40] Yeah, I was doing a little bit on my own.
[00:06:42] But mostly we worked together.
[00:06:44] It's kind of a good fit just because he's got that old-school mentality.
[00:06:49] And I come with new ideas as far as marketing and technology go.
[00:06:53] And so I've really been able to implement a lot of really cool things
[00:06:56] into our business that I've found by going to conferences or networking with HN Signline.
[00:07:02] Awesome.
[00:07:02] I love that.
[00:07:03] And I think we should just dive right in.
[00:07:05] Tell me about DIY Smart Home Guy, the YouTube channel.
[00:07:09] Yeah.
[00:07:10] So I actually have been writing for Real-Term Magazine for I think eight years now.
[00:07:15] The last five or so have been really focused on smart home technology.
[00:07:18] And so through that, I've been able to test just hundreds of products.
[00:07:22] I've got them just piled up all around me here.
[00:07:24] So companies send them to me.
[00:07:27] I test them out.
[00:07:28] But through that, I've made some friends.
[00:07:30] I have my own YouTube channel as well where I do like tours of homes
[00:07:33] and I've done like some comparison stuff.
[00:07:35] But this channel is actually run by a friend of mine.
[00:07:38] And then we have a podcast together.
[00:07:40] So we like collaborate on a bunch of stuff.
[00:07:42] But we did get a sponsor recently.
[00:07:44] So the sponsor is in the smart home space and is like giving us funds to hire a producer
[00:07:50] and really take it to the next level.
[00:07:52] So that's just been a side-passion of mine.
[00:07:55] Yeah.
[00:07:55] This podcast has kind of a similar sort of trajectory
[00:08:01] where I was doing it on my own.
[00:08:04] And then we eventually got sponsors a couple of years in.
[00:08:07] And it was like, cool.
[00:08:08] This can maybe be the cafe for itself.
[00:08:13] It's good.
[00:08:14] And it also allows me to continue to be creative.
[00:08:18] Like you're allowed to obviously be creative on your channel.
[00:08:21] And it's nice that you're providing a lot of value too.
[00:08:24] Tell me.
[00:08:25] So tell me about it.
[00:08:26] So what is exciting you right now in the smart home space?
[00:08:31] What are you sort of geeking out about, so to speak?
[00:08:36] Yeah, quite a few things.
[00:08:38] So lawnmowers, the robotic lawnmowers has been a big trend.
[00:08:43] Three of them that we're testing right now.
[00:08:45] I think it's got a ways to go.
[00:08:46] But there's some potential there.
[00:08:48] And then different styles of voice assistance.
[00:08:52] So everyone's familiar with Google, Siri, Alexa.
[00:08:56] I got to be careful because there's so many of them around.
[00:08:58] I can't wait to get back to it.
[00:09:00] But I've actually been working with a company called Josh AI.
[00:09:04] And so it's very privacy-focused.
[00:09:06] And the data stays within your home.
[00:09:09] It works with all sorts of things.
[00:09:11] So that's been pretty cool.
[00:09:12] So to get in on the ground floor on some of these new technologies,
[00:09:15] it's pretty interesting and then to have direct contacts.
[00:09:18] And kind of honestly, shape where the future of smart home technology goes.
[00:09:23] Because through these conversations, we're able to give feedback.
[00:09:26] And some of the manufacturers are actually listening.
[00:09:30] And that's fun for me to be able to see them iterate on products.
[00:09:33] And then come back with a new generation that addresses a problem that we discovered.
[00:09:37] Well, that's true.
[00:09:38] Because engineers or developers may not be the end user of the product.
[00:09:44] So they rely on people like you who spread the word and say,
[00:09:48] hey, I'm into this.
[00:09:49] Here's how it practically sort of works or doesn't work.
[00:09:52] And you can actually help the product's life cycle
[00:09:56] by providing suggestions to the developer roadmap.
[00:09:59] And saying if we just did this or that,
[00:10:02] that is a really cool place to be.
[00:10:04] You get to try all the newest stuff.
[00:10:07] I'm curious if we relate this back to your real estate practice.
[00:10:10] Does do you incorporate smart home or any technology
[00:10:17] into when you're listing a property, for example?
[00:10:20] Like I'd love to know what systems you're sort of not getting it listed.
[00:10:24] But just sort of what you're doing to the home to sort of prep it.
[00:10:27] Because I imagine smart home is a big thing for you.
[00:10:31] Yeah, I mean, smart homes are really a driver for the buyers.
[00:10:36] For sellers to like having a doorbell,
[00:10:38] a video doorbell is nice to know who's who's there.
[00:10:41] Sure.
[00:10:42] If they've gone and stuff.
[00:10:43] But yeah, I don't know that we are doing anything
[00:10:47] like to add to the listings.
[00:10:49] I just tend to attract more technological-focused people
[00:10:52] because they see my content that I'm doing.
[00:10:54] The other nerds, geeks and stuff, they reach out.
[00:10:57] And some of those guys are doing pretty well for themselves.
[00:11:00] And so it's a good point.
[00:11:02] Yeah, listings that way.
[00:11:04] That's a good point.
[00:11:05] Yeah, that's I didn't think of that.
[00:11:07] But that's a really interesting point.
[00:11:08] So your YouTube channel, which has over 30,000 subscribers,
[00:11:11] that is not a, I mean, it's a small number in, you know,
[00:11:16] compared to Mr. Beast, but you're not, you know,
[00:11:17] we're not trying to be Mr. Beast.
[00:11:19] But for a REALTOR and for somebody doing a side-passion,
[00:11:23] that is a super impressive number.
[00:11:25] Congratulations on that.
[00:11:26] You've done almost 200 videos up there.
[00:11:30] And you would have a subscription part as well.
[00:11:33] So I love all of that.
[00:11:35] I'd love to know a little, so what was it,
[00:11:38] what I thought was interesting is,
[00:11:39] you have this YouTube channel and you get to explore your passion
[00:11:42] and you get sent products and get to review them
[00:11:44] and provide feedback and tell the world about them.
[00:11:47] And you've mentioned, oh, and I also sometimes get business
[00:11:50] as a result from this.
[00:11:51] So can you talk a little bit about how that happens?
[00:11:54] Because, you know, when I look at your YouTube channel,
[00:11:56] I don't see, I don't see RE/MAX, I don't see, I'm a REALTOR.
[00:12:00] Hey, you know, this isn't, I do this other thing too.
[00:12:04] It's just a, you know, DIY smart home sort of channel.
[00:12:08] So how does that translate into business for you?
[00:12:12] Yeah, so there's actually three different channels here.
[00:12:15] So the DIY smart home guy is a collaboration with a friend.
[00:12:19] And that he does like videos on there and then we do a podcast together.
[00:12:23] And then I've got my primary channel,
[00:12:26] brand of oil, MN, and that's got a lot of like tours.
[00:12:29] And I'll highlight the technology there.
[00:12:31] And then my third channel is more real estate branded.
[00:12:34] And that's around new construction and neighborhood tours.
[00:12:37] So walking through and just kind of highlighting different things.
[00:12:41] But really, all of it positions me as an expert.
[00:12:43] And then you can also take all that content,
[00:12:45] which I imagine you do with this as well.
[00:12:47] And create more micro content.
[00:12:49] And so then we can drip that out on the other channels,
[00:12:51] Instagram, Facebook, and so on.
[00:12:54] So really, just as much content as you're
[00:12:56] can possibly put out there, the position is you as an expert.
[00:12:59] And keeps you in front of people on top of mine is going to result in more business.
[00:13:04] And with the smart home tech, it's related to the home too.
[00:13:07] So I love the, I know you have channels that do more real estate focused stuff.
[00:13:13] As you mentioned, I love the DIY smart home.
[00:13:17] I keep going back to that because you're right.
[00:13:19] There's always new products coming out.
[00:13:20] There's always new videos to make.
[00:13:22] And you've immersed yourself in that community and you're sort of somebody
[00:13:25] that gets sent these products.
[00:13:27] And so there's always fun, cool stuff to try out,
[00:13:29] which I think is must be a lot of fun.
[00:13:31] And you're creating content around it, which is also fun and also hard work.
[00:13:36] And then the ability to repurpose that content,
[00:13:38] or rather to chop up that content into bite-sized pieces,
[00:13:42] as Brandon was mentioning.
[00:13:44] We have a lot of REALTORS who listen to our show,
[00:13:47] who do video content on social.
[00:13:49] Maybe they're answering questions or talking about a particular topic.
[00:13:53] And that's it.
[00:13:55] They don't think to maybe chop it up.
[00:13:58] And I'm curious how you found the engagement on the short form video sign.
[00:14:05] And when we say short form video, we'll say,
[00:14:07] you know, 30 seconds or less, maybe 60 seconds or less.
[00:14:10] And then longer form video, you know, could be minutes and minutes.
[00:14:14] How do you find that people are best of,
[00:14:17] sorry, let me ask a different question.
[00:14:19] How do you find that consumers who you may want to work with as a REALTOR?
[00:14:24] Are they more drawn to the short form content,
[00:14:27] a long form content?
[00:14:28] Is it kind of anything and everything?
[00:14:31] Yeah, so you really, you need to do it all.
[00:14:33] So the short form content is great because it allows you to stay top of mind.
[00:14:38] You can really pump that out.
[00:14:40] I mean, it's also really good for discovery.
[00:14:42] So it goes over all these different channels.
[00:14:45] And what I first started doing stuff on YouTube,
[00:14:47] I later was sharing it on Facebook and other places and people
[00:14:51] thought that I had just created that.
[00:14:53] And I realized is that while people might be on all those platforms,
[00:14:57] they don't use them every day.
[00:14:59] And so they might have one that's a preference.
[00:15:02] And I can take that same content and put it on Instagram.
[00:15:05] And it's like a whole different audience.
[00:15:06] And they engage in it in a different way.
[00:15:08] And so you kind of need to be segmenting it and then respecting that audience.
[00:15:13] But the short form stuff really is what draws them in.
[00:15:18] It kind of triggers them.
[00:15:20] And then the long form stuff is where you can just demonstrate your expertise.
[00:15:23] And so with long form, I really focus on search.
[00:15:27] So with like new construction, I'll go deep about the neighborhoods and the communities in our area.
[00:15:32] And people that are searching those, they're very high intent.
[00:15:36] So those videos aren't going to get as much views.
[00:15:39] But like the type of person that's watching them is very serious about moving
[00:15:43] in this area and they want an expert.
[00:15:46] And so this is a way where I can demonstrate my expertise.
[00:15:48] And it's working 24, 7 for me.
[00:15:51] So I'd love to sort of break this out a little bit.
[00:15:53] So in order for you to first determine
[00:15:57] what the content of one of these videos is.
[00:16:00] And you mentioned sort of going after a very specific question
[00:16:04] that I thought I heard the word long or long tale.
[00:16:08] Meaning what that means is you're looking for somebody that's basically typing out
[00:16:13] a full sentence with a question specific to real estate in Minneapolis.
[00:16:19] And not just doing a, hey, moving to Minneapolis, here's what you need to know.
[00:16:23] And that's okay too.
[00:16:24] That would just be more difficult to probably rank for because that's a more general thing.
[00:16:29] So are you going really hyper local and you're getting really granular and saying
[00:16:32] the best restaurants on this part of the town or the best, you know, whatever?
[00:16:39] Yeah, there's certainly people that are able to do that like with restaurants.
[00:16:43] I really focus on new construction and the neighborhoods and then also schools.
[00:16:48] So like where I'm at in Maple Grove, we're on the border of two different school districts.
[00:16:53] And the one obviously, I guess not obviously, but for those moving here,
[00:16:58] they'll find out that the Wise Out of Schools is the better of the two.
[00:17:02] And so I know that people are going to be searching for Maple Grove home,
[00:17:06] Wise Out of Schools. And so by going from that longer tail, I'm going to get more of a serious
[00:17:12] buyer versus somebody that's just like Maple Grove home for sale. So yes.
[00:17:18] So exactly. So you're basically taking questions that your clients have asked you or you suspect
[00:17:25] would ask you. For example, hey, you know, we're on the, there's two school districts and you
[00:17:31] probably would want to know before searching for homes, which one you want your children to go to,
[00:17:36] which of course every parent does. So that's actually brilliant. And you know, in the sense of,
[00:17:41] well, it's brilliant in the sense of your, you're literally providing value to people who want that
[00:17:46] exact answer. And there's probably not a ton of competition around that I suspect as well.
[00:17:52] Yeah. You know, I've been telling people about this for eight years and no one's doing it.
[00:17:57] No one's doing it. Yeah, they're not doing the work. But it's pretty straightforward.
[00:18:01] Google is number two search engine search for something like that is going to come up video
[00:18:06] creates authority. I mean, I'm getting five times return on investment on video content that I create.
[00:18:13] And that's including the cost of of having someone actually follow me around with a video camera
[00:18:19] and the hiring, the editing, I don't do any of that myself. So there's definitely, it's definitely
[00:18:24] worthwhile. You just got to commit to it. It's a consistency thing. You can't do like three videos
[00:18:29] and expect to get results. It's like, you do 50 videos and then all this and the phones are again.
[00:18:35] Yeah. And those videos, if the if the contents evergreen or sort of always in favor or always,
[00:18:42] you know, going to answer the question that person has that should in theory stay right at the top
[00:18:49] of the search results until maybe something better knocks it out. But then you would know that.
[00:18:54] And then you could always come back and raise the new version of it. Yeah.
[00:18:58] It's that's amazing. So what we're really talking about is answering questions. And again,
[00:19:04] the funny thing about what Brandon's saying is he's not looking for hundreds of thousands of views.
[00:19:08] I mean, that would be awesome. I'm sure or maybe it wouldn't. I don't even know if it would be awesome.
[00:19:12] But he's looking for people that want the answer to that specific question, which is maybe not a
[00:19:17] wide audience, but that means less competition, less people are making videos about that because they
[00:19:21] don't know about it. Are curious, are you using any tools to to find the questions that you're
[00:19:30] answering or you just going through, hey, I'm a REALTOR, I get asked stuff all the time. Those
[00:19:34] are my ideas. Yeah. So it's a mixture, right? So I know the type of questions and scenarios that
[00:19:42] we're going to encounter a lot and specifically around new construction because people don't tend to
[00:19:47] build new homes every year. So maybe it's once every 10 years, but having that experience and
[00:19:52] having gone through it, I know what things that they're going to ask. And so I can create content
[00:19:56] there, but also you can use any tool like chat GPT or something and just kind of prompt it and say,
[00:20:02] what questions do people have or you could also look at like other markets too. Like, oh, hey,
[00:20:08] this person in Arizona did really well with this. This got a lot of traction for them. I could do
[00:20:13] something similar for my area, highlighting similar things. Yeah, it's a great answer. I wanted
[00:20:20] to ask you about chat GPT because I am curious pretty much we're all using it in some capacity, I think.
[00:20:27] How are you using it? I want to know how you use it and what it's doing for your business.
[00:20:32] Yeah. So it's really good for repurposing content. I can take like a transcript from, let's say,
[00:20:37] this podcast and then run it through there. It'll give me a summary. I can use that as a blog
[00:20:43] post or I can use that for social. That way when I'm sharing content and chopping it up in
[00:20:49] different ways, I'm being respectful of each platform. It's not like a copy and paste. It's like,
[00:20:54] okay, well, let's optimize this for Instagram. Instagram is all about imagery. So let's do emojis,
[00:21:00] less text. But if I'm going over to LinkedIn, you know, it's more professional. I might just use
[00:21:04] one photo. It might be more lengthy text, but it's almost a different style of voice. And so with
[00:21:13] a Chantu BT or other tools similar to that, you can kind of change it. Say with headlines,
[00:21:18] you can A, B, test things. It's good for ideas. What it's not good for is people that just say,
[00:21:23] hey, write me an article about XYZ. You just garbage in, garbage out. It doesn't have the expertise
[00:21:29] like you do. And people are looking for stories. They're looking for insights that they can't get
[00:21:35] elsewhere. And so if the AI bot can just look it up themselves, then why would the consumer need you?
[00:21:42] So, but you can take that knowledge you have and you can kind of word vomit on any AI system.
[00:21:48] And then like, just say, hey, like this is my audience. He's kind of one in thinking,
[00:21:54] let's work together on this and kind of massage it. So I think if you look at it as a partnership,
[00:21:59] then it can be a great tool. But if you're just trying to rely on it as a shortcut or an
[00:22:04] automation, then it's not good. And it's a terrible experience for the consumer. And I think you're
[00:22:10] actually doing worse than you are good. You know, could not agree with you more. I found a really,
[00:22:16] this is such a simple idea, but I do a tip of the week email with from tips from these top producers
[00:22:23] that I've chatted with on the podcast over the years. And one of them was a chat GBT tip. And
[00:22:30] if something I had, I don't, I don't practice real estate myself. So easy for me not to have thought
[00:22:36] of this, but a really good idea is and I was testing this yesterday. You know,
[00:22:42] if somebody, one of my guests was telling me that on his way to a showing, and if he's not as
[00:22:46] familiar with the area or the neighborhood or what's surrounding or the schools or anything that's
[00:22:53] sort of noteworthy or fun to talk about or interesting, he throws the address into chat GBT and
[00:22:59] says, find everything you know about the area. And he gets really specific. I want to know about
[00:23:04] restaurants. I want to know about schools. I, you know, and it's this big long prompt. It's
[00:23:09] probably 10, 10 sentences or more. And you know, he kind of copies and pastes it. You know, he doesn't
[00:23:14] rewrite it each time. And it just, you know, it will return all sorts of interesting facts. And so
[00:23:20] this way when he shows up at a, you know, a showing, he's got tons of information now that he can kind
[00:23:26] of throw out there throughout the showing. So hey, by the way, did you know there's a park just two
[00:23:29] blocks away and he might not have known that. So I found that to be like, that's a cool thing. Yeah,
[00:23:35] a chat GBT is a good bullshitter, you know, like I knew this all along, but but but you're absolutely
[00:23:42] right. It is, it is, it's great for stuff like that. And I anyway, I love that. So let's, I want to
[00:23:49] talk about now you running your real estate practice with your father. I want to know what systems
[00:23:55] have been helpful for you guys in running your business. Yeah, sure. So obviously you want to start
[00:24:03] with a good CRM, right? Like we were very early in contact, actually, which I absolutely loved. I
[00:24:09] loved the scoring system, the database health, the rules, there's so much about it that was awesome.
[00:24:14] I actually worked for a real estate tech company for a while afterwards. And I was like, just like,
[00:24:19] make that, make that. Nobody's really gotten quite close. But like currently we use follow-up
[00:24:25] us for our CRM. One of the reasons is it tracks both our email and like phone stuff. So
[00:24:33] for me, that's helpful. And then we have transparency across the team members. So I can see like,
[00:24:37] oh, yeah, that already was done. I don't have to check in. So that's kind of nice. Then, you know,
[00:24:43] I've used like every tool under the sun, honestly, for for tech. It just seems like there's a whole
[00:24:49] lot of the same. I kind of like Cloud CMA. I like, there was a company called First.io. I love that.
[00:24:55] But then RE/MAX bought it and eventually shelved it. So I was disappointing, but they did really
[00:25:00] good predictive analytics. Yeah, I don't know. I've tested so much over the years. It kind of all
[00:25:06] runs together, honestly. How important do you think as an agent knowing the important life events
[00:25:15] as the, because I do think that's going to be something that AI or, you know, just the ability
[00:25:22] to ping different databases here in as the future unfolds. I feel like that's going to be a really
[00:25:29] neat thing where AI is going to again, hey, this person, we noticed Unlinked in that this person has,
[00:25:35] just got a promotion at work or just celebrated work anniversary. So instead of going to LinkedIn
[00:25:40] every day and going through to see who, oh, I can call so and so and congratulate them. You know,
[00:25:45] life event stuff, it would be nice if that could be sort of delivered to us. Like, run into your CRMs
[00:25:51] when you're right here, which is right there. Like, here's some talking points. Like, this is
[00:25:55] what's going on in the world. Things you could bring up that are hopefully accurate. I'm starting
[00:26:00] to be huge. I'm starting to see little drips of this kind of idea. And that to me is quite exciting
[00:26:08] to be able to, you know, I'm waiting for the day that again, that the AI sort of is instructing me on,
[00:26:16] do this, do this, do this. And then I don't have to focus too much on, you know, planning.
[00:26:22] Let's talk about sort of the client experience. You know, do you incorporate any technology worth
[00:26:30] mentioning into the client experience to ensure that the client has, you know, a good, you know, time
[00:26:36] throughout the sales cycle. Yeah. So on the listing side, it's all about, you know,
[00:26:42] really good marketing upfront. And so using 360 technology, using the floor plans, using
[00:26:47] professional photography, frankly, aerial, all that. I mean, I feel like almost everybody's
[00:26:53] doing that now. If they aren't, they should. So that's pretty, pretty straightforward. I think
[00:27:05] for showings, having some sort of solution where they can see and like engage with it.
[00:27:11] What, you know, there's a lot of options out there, but just embracing one of them.
[00:27:16] That's pretty helpful. But right now we're trying out raise. So it's a new product and it's kind of
[00:27:23] just tracks all your activities and does this real-time reporting with the client. I really like the
[00:27:28] vision of where they're going. Obviously, it's very early in their rollout. So to be determined,
[00:27:34] what comes true or not. But now is the idea to be able to more easily defend commission by saying,
[00:27:44] here's all the stuff I do for you is, I'm just guessing. Yeah, that's kind of their thing.
[00:27:49] But yeah, kind of showing them behind the curtain, like, oh, here's what Brandon did today.
[00:27:54] There's so many miles driven. Here's so many calls and stuff. I think that's pretty neat.
[00:28:00] You know, that is a great idea for a product. I mean, I think it's a great idea. It seems like a great
[00:28:05] idea. I think there is a lot of money to build the product. So I guess enough people think it's a good
[00:28:11] idea. Yeah. I think the biggest opportunity, honestly, in real estate right now, is
[00:28:16] de-duplication of data and data augmentation. So a lot of agents I talk to have a CRM system,
[00:28:23] but then I ask them, like, okay, well, how many of them have completed addresses?
[00:28:27] Okay, half of them. How many of them have phone numbers? 75 percent. How many have emails?
[00:28:33] Probably higher, like 80, 90 percent. But how do we fill in that missing information? How do we
[00:28:38] make sure it's accurate? And then the other big gap is that like, I did something in one place,
[00:28:44] but now I'm in a different area in the data. It doesn't die. We don't have a single source of
[00:28:49] truth in real estate. I think if we can get to that point, agents are going to become much more
[00:28:54] productive because we spend so much time just entering the same information in twice.
[00:28:59] It's not a good workflow. I use two different CRMs, well, not intentionally, but because one of
[00:29:06] them does something very specific that cannot be duplicated by the other or cannot be replicated
[00:29:13] by the other sadly. Yes. Tell me more. Which one is in and what is it doing? Yeah. So I'm talking
[00:29:20] about corded.io. They're a really interesting product. I love these guys. So basically, I'm a
[00:29:26] recruiter for REALTORS. So I live and die by data. I want to know, for example, if I was trying
[00:29:33] to recruit you, I would want to know, you know, and again, this kind of goes back to this idea of
[00:29:39] life events. So in my world, a life event is Brandon just got a $2 million listing. And I want to be
[00:29:45] the first person to congratulate him on that listing because maybe down the road, he might
[00:29:50] not want to be at RE/MAX anymore. And he's like, DJ, you've been checking out my, you know, you've
[00:29:55] been following me and demonstrating that you care enough to check what I'm doing. You know, maybe
[00:30:00] only 950,000. But thank you. I'm really excited about it. I hope we get it sold.
[00:30:06] So this is the kind of cool stuff like corded. We'll do this where, if you could say, here's all the
[00:30:11] agents that I want to track. And they also have predictive analytics to determine which what they
[00:30:17] believe is people who are likely to move offices, which is good for two reasons. One, obviously,
[00:30:22] good to recruit, also good for retention. And they don't, it's not just based on production. It's
[00:30:27] not just while whoever's production is going down is probably likely to move. And yeah, that's
[00:30:32] might be true. But they have a whole bunch of other factors that are weighed in. And it's the best
[00:30:38] piece of tech I have seen for my world, which is the recruiting world. And there really was no tech
[00:30:43] before. There was a few other systems that try to do it. But corded is the most impressive. And
[00:30:49] they are rolling out CRM features. So they're tied into all the MLSs. That's the part that can't
[00:30:55] easily shoot over into my, I use Zoho for my other CRM. So yeah, well, I can broker metrics on
[00:31:02] steroids. What's the main thing next? Broker metrics on steroids, which, you know, to the,
[00:31:06] to the guys over at broker metrics or low and wolf now, timed update that product. I know,
[00:31:12] I know they are updating their working on it. Okay. They're working on it for the last five
[00:31:17] years. But I'm not. Yes. I'm not. Well, I acquired a bunch of companies that are trying to figure
[00:31:23] out how to ductate those together. I am, I am not exactly. And I am not picking on low and wolf. I
[00:31:28] love low and wolf. You guys are awesome. And broker metrics could use a web app. And I know they're
[00:31:33] working on it. Let's, let's, let's make that a little better. But basically what, what Brandon's
[00:31:38] talking about is important. And imagine for all of us listening, you make a, why don't recruit
[00:31:41] REALTORS? What do I care? Well, maybe you're looking for a team member. Maybe you're looking for
[00:31:45] people to partner with. Maybe you're looking for, uh, to see what agents in your area are doing.
[00:31:50] Because you might go, hmm, I want to sort of be more like them. I'm going to follow their
[00:31:54] activity. I want to see how they, and courted is really perfect for that. It's not cheap. But
[00:31:59] it's amazing for somebody like me who I can really get his granular. It's like, I would know,
[00:32:05] all of Brandon's activity every single day, I get notified in real time when Brandon does something
[00:32:11] that shows up on the MLS or it changes on the MLS. And then I get to be the first one to call.
[00:32:16] And again, you know, it's not going to work with everybody, not everybody wants that kind of
[00:32:20] recognition. But a lot of people don't get any recognition from their brokerage. They don't get
[00:32:25] a lot of like, out of boy calls. And I want to be the out of boy person because it's easy. I'm
[00:32:30] not like to be the out of boy person. It's easy to congratulate somebody on something. And I think
[00:32:35] REALTORS often miss this opportunity with their clients to create these out of boy moments. And it,
[00:32:43] you know, it's not like you're just constantly being a cheerleader for your clients. But just knowing
[00:32:46] what's going on in their lives is immensely important because it demonstrates care
[00:32:53] and conscientiousness. And just, hey, I know what I know, I know you or I know this thing about you
[00:33:00] and I'm making an effort to say, yeah, look, if you ever need to buy your cell home, yeah, I'm your guy.
[00:33:06] But I just wanted to call and say, good job on that thing or you're an inspiration of me or whatever.
[00:33:12] And that's that's the part I think REALTORS could, you know, if you're ever struggling for
[00:33:17] reason to call to call somebody, you know, look for some of those things. Maybe on Facebook,
[00:33:22] they went on a vacation and they're struggling to say, hey, I saw you want to cover.
[00:33:26] Exactly my workflow, by the way, so I have my CRM up. I've got LinkedIn, Instagram, Facebook,
[00:33:32] and I try to find something that they've done. And that's what I want to talk to them about. And they'll
[00:33:38] always like, wow, go ahead and pay attention. They're like, they're in price because not a lot of
[00:33:45] people do that. But why don't I have to keep that company in mind? So the next time my name comes
[00:33:49] across someone's desk and they call me, I can say, hey, have you heard of this tool? I like spinning
[00:33:55] it on them. If yeah, and the lottery. And that's the recruiting calls a lot of boy, have you ever
[00:34:02] had a good recruiting call? I'm always curious. What are the what are the good ones sound like?
[00:34:07] I think you've already kind of hit on it is that they're authentic in that they're trying to
[00:34:13] congratulate you or get to know you and they don't start off with, I'm calling up on behalf of or
[00:34:21] you know, like right away, like why they're this would be better this opportunity. In the persistence,
[00:34:26] too, like there's, I'll never say no, like I'm not rude to people. Like I'm just upfront with them,
[00:34:32] like how I'm happy where I'm at, but like if you want to call me again. And then when they do,
[00:34:36] I'm like, I gave you permission to call me again. So like I, I will congratulate them on their
[00:34:43] tenacity here. I was like, hey, I appreciate it. You said, dude, calling you did. So I'm still happy
[00:34:48] where I'm at, but now like your top of mind for me. So if I do move, like sure, I'll give you a call.
[00:34:54] Why not? Well, I think I think what you're what we're talking about is this move from being
[00:35:00] sales focused, which is, can I have your business? I want your business. Can I have your business?
[00:35:05] I want to be your REALTOR. I want to be your, you know, whatever I want you to join my brokerage.
[00:35:10] To, hey, Brandon, I have something that I thought would be of value to you or I noticed you did
[00:35:15] this thing. And I just wanted to say, keep it up. And then just playing the waiting game till one day
[00:35:21] if Brandon eventually goes, you know, RE/MAX is changing. It's not really meeting my needs anymore.
[00:35:27] He's going to make that decision. I am not going to be able to convince him otherwise, maybe,
[00:35:31] but probably not. He's a pretty smart guy makes his own decisions. And the idea of this, I think,
[00:35:37] is can be translated over to what what REALTORS do with their clients is be the person that's immersed
[00:35:42] in their life to some degree so that when they are ready, you know, you don't have to ask.
[00:35:47] They're just like, well, of course, that's I'm going to DJ it. He's the one that puts in the most
[00:35:52] effort or thing. Exactly. There's anything you can do to provide value to them and stay top of mind.
[00:36:00] One person I talked to was like, well, you know, I haven't talked to them in ages. I don't know
[00:36:06] what I would say. And I was like, okay, well, if you're telling me that about them, what do you think
[00:36:10] they think about you? Like when the time comes to buy or sell, like they're not going to call you
[00:36:16] because the feeling is mutual. And who knows? Like who's come into their life since then? And so
[00:36:24] there's no worse feeling than driving down the road and seeing a listing sign. What are your
[00:36:30] past client's listings? Or seeing that post on Facebook? Like we just moved. You're like,
[00:36:35] I didn't even know you didn't call like, right? Yeah, I hurt so bad. So I avoid that at all costs.
[00:36:44] Absolutely. And we've everyone's had an eight. If you've been in the business for more than five
[00:36:49] years, you've had this experience. And it's not a fun one and it's humbling. And it also
[00:36:54] happened to me. I put them on a list. I just say they're dead to me. Literally. It's a real
[00:37:02] list. It exists. I love this. I love the same thing for me. She put it away. It goes somewhere else.
[00:37:08] And that way you don't have to think about it. I have a friend and like we're close. And they don't
[00:37:14] use me. I'm like, hey, not cool. I'm going to list. And then they don't get invited to stuff anymore.
[00:37:20] I'm just I am that way. Well, well, if yeah, if you were putting in tremendous effort and they weren't
[00:37:27] reciprocal, then yeah, then it's not it's not like a ship. Yeah. We do a lot. So we do multiple
[00:37:33] client events per year. And obviously they're open to anyone. So necessarily I have to be a past client.
[00:37:39] But like, there's kind of an expectation that if you're showing up and hey, you won the TV last year
[00:37:44] that maybe you should call your pal Brandon before you move. But yeah, it doesn't always happen.
[00:37:51] I know it's a part of the business, but it's things. It does. And everyone can relate to that.
[00:37:59] I think that really the goal is of course to minimize the number of times that happens obviously.
[00:38:04] And the way that you do that is through activity. You know, the agent just has to do as much
[00:38:10] outreach as they can. Care calls, care, whatever. Caring about the client. And then, you know, just letting
[00:38:17] them know that that yeah, I think agents are missing a lot more business than they realize.
[00:38:23] I just don't see it. So once you let's open your eyes to that, then they're like, whoa,
[00:38:30] when they spend all their time, you know, chasing shiny objects and worrying about leads.
[00:38:35] And meanwhile, like their neighbor down the street is using another agent. They're their friend
[00:38:41] that they went, you know, known they played pickleball with for months. All the sun is moving. It's
[00:38:46] like, well, you know, it'd be a lot easier to just have those conversations with people that you
[00:38:50] actually know and like, hopefully get along with, then having to chase leads all day. So
[00:38:56] I've also heard too that sometimes people who are closest to a REALTOR who don't end up using them,
[00:39:03] when if the REALTOR says, hey, how come you didn't use me? I've heard this many, many times from
[00:39:09] people. They say, well, I just thought you were too busy. I didn't want to bother you. And that's
[00:39:14] its own problem that you probably wouldn't even expect. You know, I have experienced that actually.
[00:39:21] There was the perception from the type of posts. So now I really have to make sure that people know
[00:39:26] that like, I don't just sell new constructions. I sell other homes too. And I am available. And a
[00:39:32] lot of it is just like, someone's just outraged, but then also like just saying on your page,
[00:39:38] like, I'm here for you. It's like how you've word things. I always asking for the business.
[00:39:46] What do you do in between sales to state, say, maybe not top of mind, but at least they're seeing
[00:39:54] your name occasionally from time to time or hearing your voice? What are some of the ways? Because
[00:39:58] you know, people are buying and selling like you said, maybe every 10 years or so. And that's a
[00:40:05] lot of time there to lose a client, a past client, just because of time. What are you guys doing to
[00:40:11] keep the management? Yeah, great question. So we have a very multi-pronged approach. You know,
[00:40:15] it's not a one size fits all situation. So first it starts with categorizing people in our database.
[00:40:21] You know, some are worth more than others. We do ABCs. It was about the Raving fans and past clients.
[00:40:26] That type of thing. So segmentation leads to like what types of follow up they receive. But
[00:40:32] everybody's going to be on a monthly e-newsletter and a physical mailing newsletter. And those are both
[00:40:39] full custom. And so it kind of used that as evidence of success, kind of highlight what we're doing,
[00:40:44] market trends, some generic, interesting things that people like and more than just your
[00:40:51] canned type thing. And so it's personalized to us. There's going to be some tech in there and
[00:40:57] people tend to like that. There we got the social media. So they're seeing that on all the platform.
[00:41:02] Very regularly. So if they ever log into there, they're going to know that like I sell real estate
[00:41:07] new construction tech. That's me. So we got that. Everybody's getting a quarterly phone call at
[00:41:15] minimum. We'll do like personalized like tech store. Might be I don't do handwritten notes. My
[00:41:21] handwriting's terrible. I should have been a doctor. But we do that in events. We do two events a
[00:41:26] year. And so the nice thing with the events is that it's really just an excuse to reach out to
[00:41:30] people. And so if it costs 50 bucks per person, even the people that didn't show up are getting
[00:41:37] impacted by that because I called them and said, Hey, I'm doing this cool thing. Are you
[00:41:41] want to go? And then like they see the thing happen. They get to follow up. Oh, hey, we missed you.
[00:41:48] And for the people that do go, obviously, we have the invitation. We have the FaceTime with them.
[00:41:53] When we see them in person, and then we have the follow up app where it's thanking them. And
[00:41:57] it's really been a really great way to just stay in contact with people for like a decade.
[00:42:03] That way. It's brilliant because I liked what I heard, although you didn't explicitly say it,
[00:42:09] but this is what I heard. We talked about putting on an event, having a number of registrants,
[00:42:14] people who we just had a summit last week. It in person summit. We do it for our brokers.
[00:42:20] I'm sorry, everyone in Illinois is a broker. So we just call them for our REALTORS. And then
[00:42:26] we also invited a bunch of prospective Kale agents. And in about 80 of them said they were coming.
[00:42:35] And 30 of them showed up. And that's fine. And I could have gone, oh, man, those other 50 didn't show.
[00:42:41] And I realized, no, no, it doesn't matter whether they showed because I could call them anyway and say,
[00:42:46] Oh, I'm sorry, I missed you. I know you were busy. Hey, I still have some things for you.
[00:42:49] It almost doesn't matter. I mean, if they're great, if they're not there, it doesn't matter.
[00:42:56] Yeah, especially if you can create excitement too. If you like the post video type thing,
[00:43:02] a sizzle, a lot of people want people to feel like they really missed out on them. They can go.
[00:43:07] Oh, like, look at all the people there. It's such a good time. I guess I got to make the next one.
[00:43:12] And it's when you consistently do things that people start to just expect it. They're like, well,
[00:43:16] are you going to do the boat cruise again next year? I want to make sure I'm on the boat cruise.
[00:43:20] What day are you going to do that? I want to schedule around that. I guess, perfect.
[00:43:24] All right. Well, the only reason we can do the boat cruise every year is because of the referrals.
[00:43:30] And so I start calling people out on the boat, with the microphone. John over here gave me three
[00:43:35] referrals this year. And so all these drinks that we're drinking now, that's because John supported
[00:43:41] our business. I love that part of business too. We can keep doing this. Or if you want to be
[00:43:47] on shore, not having a good tonight, well, you know, don't spread the good word. People really get it.
[00:43:54] Like it takes a little bit at first. And they're like, oh, yeah, sure. Like this wasn't free.
[00:43:59] I need to give him referrals. Well, here's what's great about that. You're not even peeling
[00:44:05] back the curtain. There is no curtain. You're like, this is how we do things. This is how we pay for
[00:44:10] it. It's honest. It's authentic. And it's true. So it's one of those things that I don't think most
[00:44:16] most people are willing to sort of say like how you know, again, you're not, they're not really,
[00:44:21] they're just wanting to have a good time and wanting to put on a good party. And you're like,
[00:44:25] hey, by the way, guys, the way we're able to do this is because of your referrals. So thank you,
[00:44:29] thank you, thank you. Please keep them coming because we want to keep doing this. And even just
[00:44:33] seeing that. They're like, all right, okay, cool. That makes sense. It's logical. And it's
[00:44:38] reasonable. It's absolutely reasonable. And the other trick we learned too is well, a couple of
[00:44:44] things here. One, you don't have to spend a ton of money if you're broke, like you just invite
[00:44:48] people over for dinner. You can do like a barbecue, whatever. That's fine. I've done like sweets
[00:44:54] at like a sporting event and it's cost so much money and then no, some of no shows. And that's
[00:44:59] like, man, that was $200. And so there's very diminishing returns on these things. So it's more about,
[00:45:05] you know, impact and being as inclusive as possible. The other part of it is I've always,
[00:45:11] I've started encouraging people to bring guests and invite a friend and then like, oh, but
[00:45:17] you know, we need to have a head cow for food. So if your friend could just go ahead and register,
[00:45:23] so we have their email, we know they're coming. That'd be great. But then like at these events,
[00:45:28] I know who was my client and who wasn't. So I can see the people that weren't and I go and introduce
[00:45:34] myself and they all, well, I always say like, oh, my agent, you know, I got this stupid cutting board
[00:45:40] or something that they definitely didn't want and they laugh about it. And I'm like, oh, that's
[00:45:44] yeah, that's a pretty common gift. Like, for us, we like to do these events because like, I think
[00:45:49] it's more fun. And they're like, well, that's really cool. Like we're definitely going to use you
[00:45:52] next time. And it's worked. So I love that. Okay, I want to ask you a recruiting question. And
[00:46:00] for everyone who's going, I don't recruit REALTORS, I promise this will absolutely apply to your
[00:46:05] business. So Brandon is one, Brandon and his father are two of the top agents in in Minneapolis.
[00:46:12] I know a few of the bigger players in that space and Brandon and his father are definitely in that
[00:46:18] space. So I know you get recruiting calls. So how I'm wanting the audience to think about this is,
[00:46:24] you know, that big listing that you really want that that might be, you know, being, you know,
[00:46:29] called on by four different REALTORS, four different listing presentations. Brandon is kind of the
[00:46:35] the hot client that everyone's trying to get to leave RE/MAX and go elsewhere. What I am curious
[00:46:43] has anyone ever been disciplined, has any firm ever been disciplined enough to maintain a consistent,
[00:46:52] you know, even though you're like, I'm happier at RE/MAX, which is good would be like, I'm happy with
[00:46:56] my current agent. I don't need another agent right now. Has anyone ever gotten close to breaking
[00:47:01] through through just repetition or do most people just give up most recruiters are just one and
[00:47:08] because you were talking about the repetition being so important. Yeah, well, I feel like the
[00:47:13] churn in that industry is pretty high. So I'm like a cockroach and I've outlasted a lot of them,
[00:47:18] but there are certainly brokerages that do a good job that I would, if somebody changed tomorrow,
[00:47:26] like I would call them, like, and for that reason that you mentioned is that they've been consistent
[00:47:32] and respectful in their outreach. There's definitely been some people that will call or they hire
[00:47:37] somebody to call and it's just very much like, you don't feel they're not authentic, right? Like,
[00:47:44] oh, your name came across my desk. Oh, I'm so excited. It was like, oh, yeah, uh-huh, uh-huh.
[00:47:49] Like, tell me what was the address of that challenge of a little thing? Whereas, like, people that,
[00:47:55] like, know that I'm a nerd, but ask about that, like, lead with these types of things or knew that
[00:48:01] I spoke at an event like, oh, wow, that was cool. That kind of sticks with me and a lot of it's
[00:48:07] a culture type thing too. Yeah. Yeah. There's a couple of companies out there that I would certainly
[00:48:13] interview with if we weren't happy, but- As of right now, pretty content. So- Right. And the best
[00:48:20] recruiters are going, that's okay. I'm going to just keep dripping on Brandon until hopefully one day
[00:48:25] he is starting to look elsewhere. And again, you sort of just- my dad taught me this in sales. He's
[00:48:31] not a salesy person at all. He said, you know, if you're- he's in a different industry, but he would say,
[00:48:37] if your guy ever really screws up, I'd love the opportunity to try. That's basically what he would
[00:48:42] say. And he goes, I'm not a good person. I mean, I've got a- Got an in. I was using the same
[00:48:46] photographer forever and this guy was just very polite. He said, well, hey, you know, if your guy's
[00:48:51] ever just busy and you want to give me a shot, like, just 20% off for your first order. And I was
[00:48:57] like, oh, cool, whatever. And then a couple of months went by and I was like, oh, I actually have a
[00:49:01] need. And then I was like, oh, it's such a great job. And then, you know, I've got more listings.
[00:49:07] And I'm like, well, why don't we give him another shot? And then now it's that's the only company I use.
[00:49:13] So I'm a repetition repetition. And I wanted to ask you sort of post NAR settlement. I don't
[00:49:22] want to talk about the settlement, but I want to talk about the sort of buying and selling experience
[00:49:29] with related to sort of where you see technology taking the consumer. So obviously, Zillow came into
[00:49:36] the market early 2000s and basically said, hey, we can show all the properties to, to, or we can,
[00:49:41] we can, you know, we can aggregate all of the properties in the country and and show those to
[00:49:46] people, you know, on a, on a website. And that took a little bit of the pressure off the agent
[00:49:52] as then do those searches. Do you see the REALTOR as technology continues to evolve becoming more
[00:50:00] important, less important, the same to the consumer. Does the role is it changing?
[00:50:07] Yeah. So like, this is an agent we never really, in recent times, been the driver of search, right?
[00:50:13] Like they have all their own options. You might have them set up on a search, but they're probably still
[00:50:17] like going elsewhere. Like, why I found this one on Zillow? Well, it's sold subdued to inspection.
[00:50:21] So it's not available. But thanks for sending that. So they've always been kind of just
[00:50:27] lucky lose on their own. So I think that'll continue. One concern I have is that there might become a
[00:50:33] mindset across buyer consumers that they, it would be advantageous for them to go direct to the
[00:50:40] listing agent. And so having a system in place to receive these calls, I think it's important
[00:50:46] whether it's like a call action type thing or they're getting a tax response. So for your,
[00:50:52] like your sign calls, I think sign calls are going to go up, like the viability of buying leads on
[00:50:57] Zillow that goes down because, you know, like there's no guarantee. Now we got to get them to sign a
[00:51:05] buyer rep and like in our state, buyer rep has been common for a long time. A lot of people were
[00:51:10] just putting zeros or like not taking it serious, but like we've had that instrument. So the transition
[00:51:15] for those of us that are professional has been pretty easy. But I think for some of them, maybe
[00:51:20] just a shock. Like what do you mean? I don't just automatically get this. And so there might be
[00:51:25] some struggles there, but that's okay. You know, savvy agents will roll with it and utilize
[00:51:31] technology in a way that enhances the customer experience and earns them more market share. And then
[00:51:37] the part-time is, you know, maybe they're going to finally see their way out. But right behind them,
[00:51:43] there's going to be three more because we clamorize real estate on TV. So make it look easy. And it'll
[00:51:49] just be a revolving door. I don't think well, or we'll see a reduction in agent count, to be honest.
[00:51:55] Well, there is definitely a a a a a a flee going on. We have a holding company here for people that
[00:52:03] aren't actively practicing. And the beginning of the year, I think we had 800 agents in it. Now we
[00:52:08] have 1100 agents in it. And we don't normally grow that fast. So people are leaving, but people are
[00:52:13] coming to place them. That's that's that's that's exactly exactly right. I think to good agents seem
[00:52:24] to not have been as affected by the buyer agency agreement. This is, you know, a a a pretty
[00:52:31] standard sort of idea that if as an agent, you wanted your client, you're hired to understand
[00:52:37] commissions. You would have probably used some version of that tool in the past to explain,
[00:52:44] hey, you're not technically cutting me a check, but here's how it all works. Exactly. Yeah.
[00:52:50] Yeah. It's having the consultation up front, bringing them into the office, talking about their
[00:52:55] goals and walking them through the process. Anyways, I actually have a hard stop here. So I
[00:53:02] awesome. Got to run. All right, Brandon. Thank you. At my door. I am I am grateful for you.
[00:53:08] On behalf of everyone, thank you, Brandon. We appreciate you. We will send, check out the links
[00:53:13] in the show notes. We'll get you all over. Brandon's got to go. Thank you, Brandon. We'll see
[00:53:16] everybody on the next episode. Thank you, sir. Alrighty. Take care. Thanks.

Today on the show, my guest is Brandon Doyle from the Doyle real estate team with RE/MAX results in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Let me tell you more about Brandon. This is Brandon. I'm so excited about Brandon because this is really right up my alley and he is an expert in the things that I'm interested in. But let me tell you more about him. So Brandon Doyle has a bachelor's of science from St. Cloud State University, which was a real estate major. He also has a master of science real estate degree from the University of St. Thomas. He previously served on the Minnesota REALTOR Board of Directors as an appointee for several years and he is a past president of the St. Cloud State Real Estate Alumni Association. Brandon has been nominated as Inman's Innovative REALTOR of the Year 2014. He's been featured in many magazines and newspapers, really talking about the cutting edge of technology in the real estate industry. Brandon is also listed on Inman News as one of the most influential people in real estate for 2017 and is recognized as a rising young professional by finance and commerce in 2020. And I left out about 20 other things that he has accomplished. But in the interest of time, I want to bring him on. Brandon Doyle is our guest. And I want everybody to check out his YouTube channel, which is DIY smart Brandon. I'm so sorry, DIY smart. So we have a podcast and the podcast is on DIY smart home guy. But I also have my own channel as well, which is just Brandon Doyle. Amen. Got it. Actually several channels, but those are the two big ones where you can find me. If you're interested in smart home technology, awesome. And DIY smart home guy is where you find that on YouTube. I will have a link to that. He has a healthy subscriber base there. He's got really well-produced videos. Check it out. We'll have a link directly to that in the show notes. And if you're somebody that's looking for a REALTOR in the Minneapolis area, Doyle real estate team is the team to go with. And we'll have a link to their website as well. We'll have a link to all of Brandon's socials on the show notes. So Brandon, welcome to the show. Well, thanks for having me. I'm a little intimidated. I have to be honest. Because I rarely get to talk to, I talk to a lot of top 1% producers all over the country. That part doesn't intimidate me. But the fact that you are really, really tied in to technology is really exciting for me. I'm so glad that we were able to connect because this is a conversation that I would love to have had all throughout the years of doing the show. And I really haven't. So I'm excited to have it with you. But I'd love to tell our audience a little bit more about how you got started. I know you worked on a team with your father, which is awesome. So I know that that's part of the story. But you really were in real estate all the way back into college. You knew that was kind of a path for you. So I'd love to find out, how did you decide to go into real estate? And what did that look like for you? Yeah, it's my own little cliche. But growing up, I was destined not to do real estate. Because my dad was working the nights and weekends and missing sporting events. And I was like, I would never do that. And then fast forward. Here I am on a team with him. But I did go to college for real estate. So I have a bachelor's degree. And it's more of commercial real estate focus. And then I did go back and get my masters as well, also in real estate. So two degrees that absolutely do nothing in the world of residential sales. But really good for networking and understanding things beyond just the day to day. Yeah. And when you got started, did you immediately start with your dad or did you start on your own? And you guys came together later? Yeah, I was doing a little bit on my own. But mostly we worked together. It's kind of a good fit just because he's got that old-school mentality. And I come with new ideas as far as marketing and technology go. And so I've really been able to implement a lot of really cool things into our business that I've found by going to conferences or networking with HN Signline. Awesome. I love that. And I think we should just dive right in. Tell me about DIY Smart Home Guy, the YouTube channel. Yeah. So I actually have been writing for Real-Term Magazine for I think eight years now. The last five or so have been really focused on smart home technology. And so through that, I've been able to test just hundreds of products. I've got them just piled up all around me here. So companies send them to me. I test them out. But through that, I've made some friends. I have my own YouTube channel as well where I do like tours of homes and I've done like some comparison stuff. But this channel is actually run by a friend of mine. And then we have a podcast together. So we like collaborate on a bunch of stuff. But we did get a sponsor recently. So the sponsor is in the smart home space and is like giving us funds to hire a producer and really take it to the next level. So that's just been a side-passion of mine. Yeah. This podcast has kind of a similar sort of trajectory where I was doing it on my own. And then we eventually got sponsors a couple of years in. And it was like, cool. This can maybe be the cafe for itself. It's good. And it also allows me to continue to be creative. Like you're allowed to obviously be creative on your channel. And it's nice that you're providing a lot of value too. Tell me. So tell me about it. So what is exciting you right now in the smart home space? What are you sort of geeking out about, so to speak? Yeah, quite a few things. So lawnmowers, the robotic lawnmowers has been a big trend. Three of them that we're testing right now. I think it's got a ways to go. But there's some potential there. And then different styles of voice assistance. So everyone's familiar with Google, Siri, Alexa. I got to be careful because there's so many of them around. I can't wait to get back to it. But I've actually been working with a company called Josh AI. And so it's very privacy-focused. And the data stays within your home. It works with all sorts of things. So that's been pretty cool. So to get in on the ground floor on some of these new technologies, it's pretty interesting and then to have direct contacts. And kind of honestly, shape where the future of smart home technology goes. Because through these conversations, we're able to give feedback. And some of the manufacturers are actually listening. And that's fun for me to be able to see them iterate on products. And then come back with a new generation that addresses a problem that we discovered. Well, that's true. Because engineers or developers may not be the end user of the product. So they rely on people like you who spread the word and say, hey, I'm into this. Here's how it practically sort of works or doesn't work. And you can actually help the product's life cycle by providing suggestions to the developer roadmap. And saying if we just did this or that, that is a really cool place to be. You get to try all the newest stuff. I'm curious if we relate this back to your real estate practice. Does do you incorporate smart home or any technology into when you're listing a property, for example? Like I'd love to know what systems you're sort of not getting it listed. But just sort of what you're doing to the home to sort of prep it. Because I imagine smart home is a big thing for you. Yeah, I mean, smart homes are really a driver for the buyers. For sellers to like having a doorbell, a video doorbell is nice to know who's who's there. Sure. If they've gone and stuff. But yeah, I don't know that we are doing anything like to add to the listings. I just tend to attract more technological-focused people because they see my content that I'm doing. The other nerds, geeks and stuff, they reach out. And some of those guys are doing pretty well for themselves. And so it's a good point. Yeah, listings that way. That's a good point. Yeah, that's I didn't think of that. But that's a really interesting point. So your YouTube channel, which has over 30,000 subscribers, that is not a, I mean, it's a small number in, you know, compared to Mr. Beast, but you're not, you know, we're not trying to be Mr. Beast. But for a REALTOR and for somebody doing a side-passion, that is a super impressive number. Congratulations on that. You've done almost 200 videos up there. And you would have a subscription part as well. So I love all of that. I'd love to know a little, so what was it, what I thought was interesting is, you have this YouTube channel and you get to explore your passion and you get sent products and get to review them and provide feedback and tell the world about them. And you've mentioned, oh, and I also sometimes get business as a result from this. So can you talk a little bit about how that happens? Because, you know, when I look at your YouTube channel, I don't see, I don't see RE/MAX, I don't see, I'm a REALTOR. Hey, you know, this isn't, I do this other thing too. It's just a, you know, DIY smart home sort of channel. So how does that translate into business for you? Yeah, so there's actually three different channels here. So the DIY smart home guy is a collaboration with a friend. And that he does like videos on there and then we do a podcast together. And then I've got my primary channel, brand of oil, MN, and that's got a lot of like tours. And I'll highlight the technology there. And then my third channel is more real estate branded. And that's around new construction and neighborhood tours. So walking through and just kind of highlighting different things. But really, all of it positions me as an expert. And then you can also take all that content, which I imagine you do with this as well. And create more micro content. And so then we can drip that out on the other channels, Instagram, Facebook, and so on. So really, just as much content as you're can possibly put out there, the position is you as an expert. And keeps you in front of people on top of mine is going to result in more business. And with the smart home tech, it's related to the home too. So I love the, I know you have channels that do more real estate focused stuff. As you mentioned, I love the DIY smart home. I keep going back to that because you're right. There's always new products coming out. There's always new videos to make. And you've immersed yourself in that community and you're sort of somebody that gets sent these products. And so there's always fun, cool stuff to try out, which I think is must be a lot of fun. And you're creating content around it, which is also fun and also hard work. And then the ability to repurpose that content, or rather to chop up that content into bite-sized pieces, as Brandon was mentioning. We have a lot of REALTORS who listen to our show, who do video content on social. Maybe they're answering questions or talking about a particular topic. And that's it. They don't think to maybe chop it up. And I'm curious how you found the engagement on the short form video sign. And when we say short form video, we'll say, you know, 30 seconds or less, maybe 60 seconds or less. And then longer form video, you know, could be minutes and minutes. How do you find that people are best of, sorry, let me ask a different question. How do you find that consumers who you may want to work with as a REALTOR? Are they more drawn to the short form content, a long form content? Is it kind of anything and everything? Yeah, so you really, you need to do it all. So the short form content is great because it allows you to stay top of mind. You can really pump that out. I mean, it's also really good for discovery. So it goes over all these different channels. And what I first started doing stuff on YouTube, I later was sharing it on Facebook and other places and people thought that I had just created that. And I realized is that while people might be on all those platforms, they don't use them every day. And so they might have one that's a preference. And I can take that same content and put it on Instagram. And it's like a whole different audience. And they engage in it in a different way. And so you kind of need to be segmenting it and then respecting that audience. But the short form stuff really is what draws them in. It kind of triggers them. And then the long form stuff is where you can just demonstrate your expertise. And so with long form, I really focus on search. So with like new construction, I'll go deep about the neighborhoods and the communities in our area. And people that are searching those, they're very high intent. So those videos aren't going to get as much views. But like the type of person that's watching them is very serious about moving in this area and they want an expert. And so this is a way where I can demonstrate my expertise. And it's working 24, 7 for me. So I'd love to sort of break this out a little bit. So in order for you to first determine what the content of one of these videos is. And you mentioned sort of going after a very specific question that I thought I heard the word long or long tale. Meaning what that means is you're looking for somebody that's basically typing out a full sentence with a question specific to real estate in Minneapolis. And not just doing a, hey, moving to Minneapolis, here's what you need to know. And that's okay too. That would just be more difficult to probably rank for because that's a more general thing. So are you going really hyper local and you're getting really granular and saying the best restaurants on this part of the town or the best, you know, whatever? Yeah, there's certainly people that are able to do that like with restaurants. I really focus on new construction and the neighborhoods and then also schools. So like where I'm at in Maple Grove, we're on the border of two different school districts. And the one obviously, I guess not obviously, but for those moving here, they'll find out that the Wise Out of Schools is the better of the two. And so I know that people are going to be searching for Maple Grove home, Wise Out of Schools. And so by going from that longer tail, I'm going to get more of a serious buyer versus somebody that's just like Maple Grove home for sale. So yes. So exactly. So you're basically taking questions that your clients have asked you or you suspect would ask you. For example, hey, you know, we're on the, there's two school districts and you probably would want to know before searching for homes, which one you want your children to go to, which of course every parent does. So that's actually brilliant. And you know, in the sense of, well, it's brilliant in the sense of your, you're literally providing value to people who want that exact answer. And there's probably not a ton of competition around that I suspect as well. Yeah. You know, I've been telling people about this for eight years and no one's doing it. No one's doing it. Yeah, they're not doing the work. But it's pretty straightforward. Google is number two search engine search for something like that is going to come up video creates authority. I mean, I'm getting five times return on investment on video content that I create. And that's including the cost of of having someone actually follow me around with a video camera and the hiring, the editing, I don't do any of that myself. So there's definitely, it's definitely worthwhile. You just got to commit to it. It's a consistency thing. You can't do like three videos and expect to get results. It's like, you do 50 videos and then all this and the phones are again. Yeah. And those videos, if the if the contents evergreen or sort of always in favor or always, you know, going to answer the question that person has that should in theory stay right at the top of the search results until maybe something better knocks it out. But then you would know that. And then you could always come back and raise the new version of it. Yeah. It's that's amazing. So what we're really talking about is answering questions. And again, the funny thing about what Brandon's saying is he's not looking for hundreds of thousands of views. I mean, that would be awesome. I'm sure or maybe it wouldn't. I don't even know if it would be awesome. But he's looking for people that want the answer to that specific question, which is maybe not a wide audience, but that means less competition, less people are making videos about that because they don't know about it. Are curious, are you using any tools to to find the questions that you're answering or you just going through, hey, I'm a REALTOR, I get asked stuff all the time. Those are my ideas. Yeah. So it's a mixture, right? So I know the type of questions and scenarios that we're going to encounter a lot and specifically around new construction because people don't tend to build new homes every year. So maybe it's once every 10 years, but having that experience and having gone through it, I know what things that they're going to ask. And so I can create content there, but also you can use any tool like chat GPT or something and just kind of prompt it and say, what questions do people have or you could also look at like other markets too. Like, oh, hey, this person in Arizona did really well with this. This got a lot of traction for them. I could do something similar for my area, highlighting similar things. Yeah, it's a great answer. I wanted to ask you about chat GPT because I am curious pretty much we're all using it in some capacity, I think. How are you using it? I want to know how you use it and what it's doing for your business. Yeah. So it's really good for repurposing content. I can take like a transcript from, let's say, this podcast and then run it through there. It'll give me a summary. I can use that as a blog post or I can use that for social. That way when I'm sharing content and chopping it up in different ways, I'm being respectful of each platform. It's not like a copy and paste. It's like, okay, well, let's optimize this for Instagram. Instagram is all about imagery. So let's do emojis, less text. But if I'm going over to LinkedIn, you know, it's more professional. I might just use one photo. It might be more lengthy text, but it's almost a different style of voice. And so with a Chantu BT or other tools similar to that, you can kind of change it. Say with headlines, you can A, B, test things. It's good for ideas. What it's not good for is people that just say, hey, write me an article about XYZ. You just garbage in, garbage out. It doesn't have the expertise like you do. And people are looking for stories. They're looking for insights that they can't get elsewhere. And so if the AI bot can just look it up themselves, then why would the consumer need you? So, but you can take that knowledge you have and you can kind of word vomit on any AI system. And then like, just say, hey, like this is my audience. He's kind of one in thinking, let's work together on this and kind of massage it. So I think if you look at it as a partnership, then it can be a great tool. But if you're just trying to rely on it as a shortcut or an automation, then it's not good. And it's a terrible experience for the consumer. And I think you're actually doing worse than you are good. You know, could not agree with you more. I found a really, this is such a simple idea, but I do a tip of the week email with from tips from these top producers that I've chatted with on the podcast over the years. And one of them was a chat GBT tip. And if something I had, I don't, I don't practice real estate myself. So easy for me not to have thought of this, but a really good idea is and I was testing this yesterday. You know, if somebody, one of my guests was telling me that on his way to a showing, and if he's not as familiar with the area or the neighborhood or what's surrounding or the schools or anything that's sort of noteworthy or fun to talk about or interesting, he throws the address into chat GBT and says, find everything you know about the area. And he gets really specific. I want to know about restaurants. I want to know about schools. I, you know, and it's this big long prompt. It's probably 10, 10 sentences or more. And you know, he kind of copies and pastes it. You know, he doesn't rewrite it each time. And it just, you know, it will return all sorts of interesting facts. And so this way when he shows up at a, you know, a showing, he's got tons of information now that he can kind of throw out there throughout the showing. So hey, by the way, did you know there's a park just two blocks away and he might not have known that. So I found that to be like, that's a cool thing. Yeah, a chat GBT is a good bullshitter, you know, like I knew this all along, but but but you're absolutely right. It is, it is, it's great for stuff like that. And I anyway, I love that. So let's, I want to talk about now you running your real estate practice with your father. I want to know what systems have been helpful for you guys in running your business. Yeah, sure. So obviously you want to start with a good CRM, right? Like we were very early in contact, actually, which I absolutely loved. I loved the scoring system, the database health, the rules, there's so much about it that was awesome. I actually worked for a real estate tech company for a while afterwards. And I was like, just like, make that, make that. Nobody's really gotten quite close. But like currently we use follow-up us for our CRM. One of the reasons is it tracks both our email and like phone stuff. So for me, that's helpful. And then we have transparency across the team members. So I can see like, oh, yeah, that already was done. I don't have to check in. So that's kind of nice. Then, you know, I've used like every tool under the sun, honestly, for for tech. It just seems like there's a whole lot of the same. I kind of like Cloud CMA. I like, there was a company called First.io. I love that. But then RE/MAX bought it and eventually shelved it. So I was disappointing, but they did really good predictive analytics. Yeah, I don't know. I've tested so much over the years. It kind of all runs together, honestly. How important do you think as an agent knowing the important life events as the, because I do think that's going to be something that AI or, you know, just the ability to ping different databases here in as the future unfolds. I feel like that's going to be a really neat thing where AI is going to again, hey, this person, we noticed Unlinked in that this person has, just got a promotion at work or just celebrated work anniversary. So instead of going to LinkedIn every day and going through to see who, oh, I can call so and so and congratulate them. You know, life event stuff, it would be nice if that could be sort of delivered to us. Like, run into your CRMs when you're right here, which is right there. Like, here's some talking points. Like, this is what's going on in the world. Things you could bring up that are hopefully accurate. I'm starting to be huge. I'm starting to see little drips of this kind of idea. And that to me is quite exciting to be able to, you know, I'm waiting for the day that again, that the AI sort of is instructing me on, do this, do this, do this. And then I don't have to focus too much on, you know, planning. Let's talk about sort of the client experience. You know, do you incorporate any technology worth mentioning into the client experience to ensure that the client has, you know, a good, you know, time throughout the sales cycle. Yeah. So on the listing side, it's all about, you know, really good marketing upfront. And so using 360 technology, using the floor plans, using professional photography, frankly, aerial, all that. I mean, I feel like almost everybody's doing that now. If they aren't, they should. So that's pretty, pretty straightforward. I think for showings, having some sort of solution where they can see and like engage with it. What, you know, there's a lot of options out there, but just embracing one of them. That's pretty helpful. But right now we're trying out raise. So it's a new product and it's kind of just tracks all your activities and does this real-time reporting with the client. I really like the vision of where they're going. Obviously, it's very early in their rollout. So to be determined, what comes true or not. But now is the idea to be able to more easily defend commission by saying, here's all the stuff I do for you is, I'm just guessing. Yeah, that's kind of their thing. But yeah, kind of showing them behind the curtain, like, oh, here's what Brandon did today. There's so many miles driven. Here's so many calls and stuff. I think that's pretty neat. You know, that is a great idea for a product. I mean, I think it's a great idea. It seems like a great idea. I think there is a lot of money to build the product. So I guess enough people think it's a good idea. Yeah. I think the biggest opportunity, honestly, in real estate right now, is de-duplication of data and data augmentation. So a lot of agents I talk to have a CRM system, but then I ask them, like, okay, well, how many of them have completed addresses? Okay, half of them. How many of them have phone numbers? 75 percent. How many have emails? Probably higher, like 80, 90 percent. But how do we fill in that missing information? How do we make sure it's accurate? And then the other big gap is that like, I did something in one place, but now I'm in a different area in the data. It doesn't die. We don't have a single source of truth in real estate. I think if we can get to that point, agents are going to become much more productive because we spend so much time just entering the same information in twice. It's not a good workflow. I use two different CRMs, well, not intentionally, but because one of them does something very specific that cannot be duplicated by the other or cannot be replicated by the other sadly. Yes. Tell me more. Which one is in and what is it doing? Yeah. So I'm talking about corded.io. They're a really interesting product. I love these guys. So basically, I'm a recruiter for REALTORS. So I live and die by data. I want to know, for example, if I was trying to recruit you, I would want to know, you know, and again, this kind of goes back to this idea of life events. So in my world, a life event is Brandon just got a $2 million listing. And I want to be the first person to congratulate him on that listing because maybe down the road, he might not want to be at RE/MAX anymore. And he's like, DJ, you've been checking out my, you know, you've been following me and demonstrating that you care enough to check what I'm doing. You know, maybe only 950,000. But thank you. I'm really excited about it. I hope we get it sold. So this is the kind of cool stuff like corded. We'll do this where, if you could say, here's all the agents that I want to track. And they also have predictive analytics to determine which what they believe is people who are likely to move offices, which is good for two reasons. One, obviously, good to recruit, also good for retention. And they don't, it's not just based on production. It's not just while whoever's production is going down is probably likely to move. And yeah, that's might be true. But they have a whole bunch of other factors that are weighed in. And it's the best piece of tech I have seen for my world, which is the recruiting world. And there really was no tech before. There was a few other systems that try to do it. But corded is the most impressive. And they are rolling out CRM features. So they're tied into all the MLSs. That's the part that can't easily shoot over into my, I use Zoho for my other CRM. So yeah, well, I can broker metrics on steroids. What's the main thing next? Broker metrics on steroids, which, you know, to the, to the guys over at broker metrics or low and wolf now, timed update that product. I know, I know they are updating their working on it. Okay. They're working on it for the last five years. But I'm not. Yes. I'm not. Well, I acquired a bunch of companies that are trying to figure out how to ductate those together. I am, I am not exactly. And I am not picking on low and wolf. I love low and wolf. You guys are awesome. And broker metrics could use a web app. And I know they're working on it. Let's, let's, let's make that a little better. But basically what, what Brandon's talking about is important. And imagine for all of us listening, you make a, why don't recruit REALTORS? What do I care? Well, maybe you're looking for a team member. Maybe you're looking for people to partner with. Maybe you're looking for, uh, to see what agents in your area are doing. Because you might go, hmm, I want to sort of be more like them. I'm going to follow their activity. I want to see how they, and courted is really perfect for that. It's not cheap. But it's amazing for somebody like me who I can really get his granular. It's like, I would know, all of Brandon's activity every single day, I get notified in real time when Brandon does something that shows up on the MLS or it changes on the MLS. And then I get to be the first one to call. And again, you know, it's not going to work with everybody, not everybody wants that kind of recognition. But a lot of people don't get any recognition from their brokerage. They don't get a lot of like, out of boy calls. And I want to be the out of boy person because it's easy. I'm not like to be the out of boy person. It's easy to congratulate somebody on something. And I think REALTORS often miss this opportunity with their clients to create these out of boy moments. And it, you know, it's not like you're just constantly being a cheerleader for your clients. But just knowing what's going on in their lives is immensely important because it demonstrates care and conscientiousness. And just, hey, I know what I know, I know you or I know this thing about you and I'm making an effort to say, yeah, look, if you ever need to buy your cell home, yeah, I'm your guy. But I just wanted to call and say, good job on that thing or you're an inspiration of me or whatever. And that's that's the part I think REALTORS could, you know, if you're ever struggling for reason to call to call somebody, you know, look for some of those things. Maybe on Facebook, they went on a vacation and they're struggling to say, hey, I saw you want to cover. Exactly my workflow, by the way, so I have my CRM up. I've got LinkedIn, Instagram, Facebook, and I try to find something that they've done. And that's what I want to talk to them about. And they'll always like, wow, go ahead and pay attention. They're like, they're in price because not a lot of people do that. But why don't I have to keep that company in mind? So the next time my name comes across someone's desk and they call me, I can say, hey, have you heard of this tool? I like spinning it on them. If yeah, and the lottery. And that's the recruiting calls a lot of boy, have you ever had a good recruiting call? I'm always curious. What are the what are the good ones sound like? I think you've already kind of hit on it is that they're authentic in that they're trying to congratulate you or get to know you and they don't start off with, I'm calling up on behalf of or you know, like right away, like why they're this would be better this opportunity. In the persistence, too, like there's, I'll never say no, like I'm not rude to people. Like I'm just upfront with them, like how I'm happy where I'm at, but like if you want to call me again. And then when they do, I'm like, I gave you permission to call me again. So like I, I will congratulate them on their tenacity here. I was like, hey, I appreciate it. You said, dude, calling you did. So I'm still happy where I'm at, but now like your top of mind for me. So if I do move, like sure, I'll give you a call. Why not? Well, I think I think what you're what we're talking about is this move from being sales focused, which is, can I have your business? I want your business. Can I have your business? I want to be your REALTOR. I want to be your, you know, whatever I want you to join my brokerage. To, hey, Brandon, I have something that I thought would be of value to you or I noticed you did this thing. And I just wanted to say, keep it up. And then just playing the waiting game till one day if Brandon eventually goes, you know, RE/MAX is changing. It's not really meeting my needs anymore. He's going to make that decision. I am not going to be able to convince him otherwise, maybe, but probably not. He's a pretty smart guy makes his own decisions. And the idea of this, I think, is can be translated over to what what REALTORS do with their clients is be the person that's immersed in their life to some degree so that when they are ready, you know, you don't have to ask. They're just like, well, of course, that's I'm going to DJ it. He's the one that puts in the most effort or thing. Exactly. There's anything you can do to provide value to them and stay top of mind. One person I talked to was like, well, you know, I haven't talked to them in ages. I don't know what I would say. And I was like, okay, well, if you're telling me that about them, what do you think they think about you? Like when the time comes to buy or sell, like they're not going to call you because the feeling is mutual. And who knows? Like who's come into their life since then? And so there's no worse feeling than driving down the road and seeing a listing sign. What are your past client's listings? Or seeing that post on Facebook? Like we just moved. You're like, I didn't even know you didn't call like, right? Yeah, I hurt so bad. So I avoid that at all costs. Absolutely. And we've everyone's had an eight. If you've been in the business for more than five years, you've had this experience. And it's not a fun one and it's humbling. And it also happened to me. I put them on a list. I just say they're dead to me. Literally. It's a real list. It exists. I love this. I love the same thing for me. She put it away. It goes somewhere else. And that way you don't have to think about it. I have a friend and like we're close. And they don't use me. I'm like, hey, not cool. I'm going to list. And then they don't get invited to stuff anymore. I'm just I am that way. Well, well, if yeah, if you were putting in tremendous effort and they weren't reciprocal, then yeah, then it's not it's not like a ship. Yeah. We do a lot. So we do multiple client events per year. And obviously they're open to anyone. So necessarily I have to be a past client. But like, there's kind of an expectation that if you're showing up and hey, you won the TV last year that maybe you should call your pal Brandon before you move. But yeah, it doesn't always happen. I know it's a part of the business, but it's things. It does. And everyone can relate to that. I think that really the goal is of course to minimize the number of times that happens obviously. And the way that you do that is through activity. You know, the agent just has to do as much outreach as they can. Care calls, care, whatever. Caring about the client. And then, you know, just letting them know that that yeah, I think agents are missing a lot more business than they realize. I just don't see it. So once you let's open your eyes to that, then they're like, whoa, when they spend all their time, you know, chasing shiny objects and worrying about leads. And meanwhile, like their neighbor down the street is using another agent. They're their friend that they went, you know, known they played pickleball with for months. All the sun is moving. It's like, well, you know, it'd be a lot easier to just have those conversations with people that you actually know and like, hopefully get along with, then having to chase leads all day. So I've also heard too that sometimes people who are closest to a REALTOR who don't end up using them, when if the REALTOR says, hey, how come you didn't use me? I've heard this many, many times from people. They say, well, I just thought you were too busy. I didn't want to bother you. And that's its own problem that you probably wouldn't even expect. You know, I have experienced that actually. There was the perception from the type of posts. So now I really have to make sure that people know that like, I don't just sell new constructions. I sell other homes too. And I am available. And a lot of it is just like, someone's just outraged, but then also like just saying on your page, like, I'm here for you. It's like how you've word things. I always asking for the business. What do you do in between sales to state, say, maybe not top of mind, but at least they're seeing your name occasionally from time to time or hearing your voice? What are some of the ways? Because you know, people are buying and selling like you said, maybe every 10 years or so. And that's a lot of time there to lose a client, a past client, just because of time. What are you guys doing to keep the management? Yeah, great question. So we have a very multi-pronged approach. You know, it's not a one size fits all situation. So first it starts with categorizing people in our database. You know, some are worth more than others. We do ABCs. It was about the Raving fans and past clients. That type of thing. So segmentation leads to like what types of follow up they receive. But everybody's going to be on a monthly e-newsletter and a physical mailing newsletter. And those are both full custom. And so it kind of used that as evidence of success, kind of highlight what we're doing, market trends, some generic, interesting things that people like and more than just your canned type thing. And so it's personalized to us. There's going to be some tech in there and people tend to like that. There we got the social media. So they're seeing that on all the platform. Very regularly. So if they ever log into there, they're going to know that like I sell real estate new construction tech. That's me. So we got that. Everybody's getting a quarterly phone call at minimum. We'll do like personalized like tech store. Might be I don't do handwritten notes. My handwriting's terrible. I should have been a doctor. But we do that in events. We do two events a year. And so the nice thing with the events is that it's really just an excuse to reach out to people. And so if it costs 50 bucks per person, even the people that didn't show up are getting impacted by that because I called them and said, Hey, I'm doing this cool thing. Are you want to go? And then like they see the thing happen. They get to follow up. Oh, hey, we missed you. And for the people that do go, obviously, we have the invitation. We have the FaceTime with them. When we see them in person, and then we have the follow up app where it's thanking them. And it's really been a really great way to just stay in contact with people for like a decade. That way. It's brilliant because I liked what I heard, although you didn't explicitly say it, but this is what I heard. We talked about putting on an event, having a number of registrants, people who we just had a summit last week. It in person summit. We do it for our brokers. I'm sorry, everyone in Illinois is a broker. So we just call them for our REALTORS. And then we also invited a bunch of prospective Kale agents. And in about 80 of them said they were coming. And 30 of them showed up. And that's fine. And I could have gone, oh, man, those other 50 didn't show. And I realized, no, no, it doesn't matter whether they showed because I could call them anyway and say, Oh, I'm sorry, I missed you. I know you were busy. Hey, I still have some things for you. It almost doesn't matter. I mean, if they're great, if they're not there, it doesn't matter. Yeah, especially if you can create excitement too. If you like the post video type thing, a sizzle, a lot of people want people to feel like they really missed out on them. They can go. Oh, like, look at all the people there. It's such a good time. I guess I got to make the next one. And it's when you consistently do things that people start to just expect it. They're like, well, are you going to do the boat cruise again next year? I want to make sure I'm on the boat cruise. What day are you going to do that? I want to schedule around that. I guess, perfect. All right. Well, the only reason we can do the boat cruise every year is because of the referrals. And so I start calling people out on the boat, with the microphone. John over here gave me three referrals this year. And so all these drinks that we're drinking now, that's because John supported our business. I love that part of business too. We can keep doing this. Or if you want to be on shore, not having a good tonight, well, you know, don't spread the good word. People really get it. Like it takes a little bit at first. And they're like, oh, yeah, sure. Like this wasn't free. I need to give him referrals. Well, here's what's great about that. You're not even peeling back the curtain. There is no curtain. You're like, this is how we do things. This is how we pay for it. It's honest. It's authentic. And it's true. So it's one of those things that I don't think most most people are willing to sort of say like how you know, again, you're not, they're not really, they're just wanting to have a good time and wanting to put on a good party. And you're like, hey, by the way, guys, the way we're able to do this is because of your referrals. So thank you, thank you, thank you. Please keep them coming because we want to keep doing this. And even just seeing that. They're like, all right, okay, cool. That makes sense. It's logical. And it's reasonable. It's absolutely reasonable. And the other trick we learned too is well, a couple of things here. One, you don't have to spend a ton of money if you're broke, like you just invite people over for dinner. You can do like a barbecue, whatever. That's fine. I've done like sweets at like a sporting event and it's cost so much money and then no, some of no shows. And that's like, man, that was $200. And so there's very diminishing returns on these things. So it's more about, you know, impact and being as inclusive as possible. The other part of it is I've always, I've started encouraging people to bring guests and invite a friend and then like, oh, but you know, we need to have a head cow for food. So if your friend could just go ahead and register, so we have their email, we know they're coming. That'd be great. But then like at these events, I know who was my client and who wasn't. So I can see the people that weren't and I go and introduce myself and they all, well, I always say like, oh, my agent, you know, I got this stupid cutting board or something that they definitely didn't want and they laugh about it. And I'm like, oh, that's yeah, that's a pretty common gift. Like, for us, we like to do these events because like, I think it's more fun. And they're like, well, that's really cool. Like we're definitely going to use you next time. And it's worked. So I love that. Okay, I want to ask you a recruiting question. And for everyone who's going, I don't recruit REALTORS, I promise this will absolutely apply to your business. So Brandon is one, Brandon and his father are two of the top agents in in Minneapolis. I know a few of the bigger players in that space and Brandon and his father are definitely in that space. So I know you get recruiting calls. So how I'm wanting the audience to think about this is, you know, that big listing that you really want that that might be, you know, being, you know, called on by four different REALTORS, four different listing presentations. Brandon is kind of the the hot client that everyone's trying to get to leave RE/MAX and go elsewhere. What I am curious has anyone ever been disciplined, has any firm ever been disciplined enough to maintain a consistent, you know, even though you're like, I'm happier at RE/MAX, which is good would be like, I'm happy with my current agent. I don't need another agent right now. Has anyone ever gotten close to breaking through through just repetition or do most people just give up most recruiters are just one and because you were talking about the repetition being so important. Yeah, well, I feel like the churn in that industry is pretty high. So I'm like a cockroach and I've outlasted a lot of them, but there are certainly brokerages that do a good job that I would, if somebody changed tomorrow, like I would call them, like, and for that reason that you mentioned is that they've been consistent and respectful in their outreach. There's definitely been some people that will call or they hire somebody to call and it's just very much like, you don't feel they're not authentic, right? Like, oh, your name came across my desk. Oh, I'm so excited. It was like, oh, yeah, uh-huh, uh-huh. Like, tell me what was the address of that challenge of a little thing? Whereas, like, people that, like, know that I'm a nerd, but ask about that, like, lead with these types of things or knew that I spoke at an event like, oh, wow, that was cool. That kind of sticks with me and a lot of it's a culture type thing too. Yeah. Yeah. There's a couple of companies out there that I would certainly interview with if we weren't happy, but- As of right now, pretty content. So- Right. And the best recruiters are going, that's okay. I'm going to just keep dripping on Brandon until hopefully one day he is starting to look elsewhere. And again, you sort of just- my dad taught me this in sales. He's not a salesy person at all. He said, you know, if you're- he's in a different industry, but he would say, if your guy ever really screws up, I'd love the opportunity to try. That's basically what he would say. And he goes, I'm not a good person. I mean, I've got a- Got an in. I was using the same photographer forever and this guy was just very polite. He said, well, hey, you know, if your guy's ever just busy and you want to give me a shot, like, just 20% off for your first order. And I was like, oh, cool, whatever. And then a couple of months went by and I was like, oh, I actually have a need. And then I was like, oh, it's such a great job. And then, you know, I've got more listings. And I'm like, well, why don't we give him another shot? And then now it's that's the only company I use. So I'm a repetition repetition. And I wanted to ask you sort of post NAR settlement. I don't want to talk about the settlement, but I want to talk about the sort of buying and selling experience with related to sort of where you see technology taking the consumer. So obviously, Zillow came into the market early 2000s and basically said, hey, we can show all the properties to, to, or we can, we can, you know, we can aggregate all of the properties in the country and and show those to people, you know, on a, on a website. And that took a little bit of the pressure off the agent as then do those searches. Do you see the REALTOR as technology continues to evolve becoming more important, less important, the same to the consumer. Does the role is it changing? Yeah. So like, this is an agent we never really, in recent times, been the driver of search, right? Like they have all their own options. You might have them set up on a search, but they're probably still like going elsewhere. Like, why I found this one on Zillow? Well, it's sold subdued to inspection. So it's not available. But thanks for sending that. So they've always been kind of just lucky lose on their own. So I think that'll continue. One concern I have is that there might become a mindset across buyer consumers that they, it would be advantageous for them to go direct to the listing agent. And so having a system in place to receive these calls, I think it's important whether it's like a call action type thing or they're getting a tax response. So for your, like your sign calls, I think sign calls are going to go up, like the viability of buying leads on Zillow that goes down because, you know, like there's no guarantee. Now we got to get them to sign a buyer rep and like in our state, buyer rep has been common for a long time. A lot of people were just putting zeros or like not taking it serious, but like we've had that instrument. So the transition for those of us that are professional has been pretty easy. But I think for some of them, maybe just a shock. Like what do you mean? I don't just automatically get this. And so there might be some struggles there, but that's okay. You know, savvy agents will roll with it and utilize technology in a way that enhances the customer experience and earns them more market share. And then the part-time is, you know, maybe they're going to finally see their way out. But right behind them, there's going to be three more because we clamorize real estate on TV. So make it look easy. And it'll just be a revolving door. I don't think well, or we'll see a reduction in agent count, to be honest. Well, there is definitely a a a a a a flee going on. We have a holding company here for people that aren't actively practicing. And the beginning of the year, I think we had 800 agents in it. Now we have 1100 agents in it. And we don't normally grow that fast. So people are leaving, but people are coming to place them. That's that's that's that's exactly exactly right. I think to good agents seem to not have been as affected by the buyer agency agreement. This is, you know, a a a pretty standard sort of idea that if as an agent, you wanted your client, you're hired to understand commissions. You would have probably used some version of that tool in the past to explain, hey, you're not technically cutting me a check, but here's how it all works. Exactly. Yeah. Yeah. It's having the consultation up front, bringing them into the office, talking about their goals and walking them through the process. Anyways, I actually have a hard stop here. So I awesome. Got to run. All right, Brandon. Thank you. At my door. I am I am grateful for you. On behalf of everyone, thank you, Brandon. We appreciate you. We will send, check out the links in the show notes. We'll get you all over. Brandon's got to go. Thank you, Brandon. We'll see everybody on the next episode. Thank you, sir. Alrighty. Take care. Thanks.
