[00:01:23] Now, as a real estate recruiter, I can tell you the answer is always yes.
[00:01:27] But most agents aren't looking to move right now.
[00:01:30] So how do you know who to contact?
[00:01:32] Well, what if I were to tell you there's a recruiting and retention tool powered by artificial intelligence that shows you exactly which agents in your local market are looking to leave their brokerage right now.
[00:01:44] And which agents at your own firm are also looking to leave you.

[00:05:20] Today could not be more excited to be here. Thank you so much for having me on this lovely Monday morning.
[00:05:27] It's been a crazy one for you.
[00:05:29] Well, I'm behind the scenes, restreams started glitching right when our time was starting and I was running a minute late and so Athena has been incredibly kind and sweet and really speaks to her character.
[00:05:42] She's like so excited. She didn't care that we're starting late. She's just excited to be here and work excited to have her and I'm excited to talk to you and I want to say something right off the bat, which I was saying to you back the backstage, but I want to say it in front of everyone here is that thank you for talking about your illness that you are constantly being challenged with because of course all of us have challenges in our life.
[00:06:03] We have some of them are illnesses others are all sorts of issues, but we often don't talk about them because you know we keep them in private or we're just too we don't want to talk about it or afraid or or embarrassed or whatever it may be.
[00:06:17] And I love the fact that you brought that up front and center and really I hope some of our other listeners who might be struggling with physical ailments can relate to what you're going through and also the resilience that you've built as a result of having.
[00:06:33] That was kind of challenges in your life, so I love the fact I hate the fact that you have this illness. I love the fact I love the fact that you are so resilient as a result of it.
[00:06:43] Things go home. I always say I'm the luckiest sick person alive and I'm also an open book like my you know I'm a firm believer that if you look back at your life.
[00:06:54] The greatest moments of growth occur when you're being challenged the most and that all in just doesn't have to be chronic illness it can be divorce it can be a tough market it can be you know family issues like all of our issues are relevant for me unfortunately it's been waking up in excruciating pain for nine years.
[00:07:15] But it's taught me so much more about who I like the depths of who I am and what I stand for that I I don't know that I ever would have learned how to knock on sick.
[00:07:29] Yeah, it's funny. I always said if there is a God and if I get to meet God if there is one then the first thing I'm going to say couldn't even just give me five more IQ points.
[00:07:41] I just needed five or I could but but but second the second thing I would say is why did you have to make everything so worth what the things that are so worthwhile so hard and and God would probably say well that's how it's supposed to be.
[00:07:59] Yeah, you are without those experience 100% and I yeah, you couldn't have done it a different way.
[00:08:07] Okay, fine, but but it is it is something to you know it's like the obstacles the way that book by Ryan Holiday I always go back to that during times of really challenges the obstacle is the way even though it's the least fun thing but you know lots of things in life are unfun that are really fulfilling in fact most everything so
[00:08:26] so but but again I applaud your resilience I applaud your energy and you're just your vibe you you certainly seem to be somebody who really appreciates the good that you do have and so let's talk about that you grew up in Breckenridge so let's talk about what that life was like.
[00:08:45] Yes, so you definitely do not come across very many Denver native or Breckenridge natives let alone Colorado natives our state is you know we have over 5,000 people a month moving here so to be able to say I'm from Breckenridge is you know at 300 people in my graduating class and that was from four towns so it all collected but as I'm sure you could imagine I grew up on snow so.
[00:09:14] I believe my dad always says he'd probably be arrested for child abuse at this point because when I was three weeks old he'd strap me to his chest and take me downhill skiing I don't think you could get away with that anymore.
[00:09:28] Your dad was a professional skier let tell us what was it like to grow up on the slopes but also having a father who this was his his livelihood his life you know what was that like.
[00:09:39] You know it was something that I don't know that I took as I think I took it for granted a little bit just being so young but the first you know eight years of my life were following him to ski races all over the world he was a professional speed skier so that basically means you get clocked going as fast as you can down the mountain for miles per hour so his record was like 127 miles an hour on skis.
[00:10:09] Yeah so I grew up in that environment so it really without knowing it of course I was immediately put in with you know with some of the top coaches in the world because I'm in Breckenridge Colorado I've got this father who is a complete maniac in the best way.
[00:10:30] Who's taught you really taught me what the value of hard work is because I mean he is now 74 he's a car racer he's beating 20 year olds in Le Mans all over the world and he works out three times a day to keep in shape for that while running successful businesses.
[00:10:49] Isn't it crazy that that people who drive cars there's a there's a physicality to it that we don't we don't realize and you know somebody who's a downhill skis you know skier has to just just grind and practice and it's what it's like milliseconds they're constantly shaving off it's it's just this your dad's a competitor so you have that gene probably as well so what when did you start competing.
[00:11:16] Yeah so I like I said I was on skis what when I learned how to walk so at two years old I got my first pair of skis from about you know baby age until about 13 I was in a racing program so I ski downhill and I really think that gave me the foundational tools and again access to some of the most hardcore coaches I've ever met and that is honestly the best business school I've ever met.
[00:11:46] I ever could have asked for was becoming an athlete and that is because they taught me the the value of hard work of showing up when you say you're going to of accountability of vulnerability because they were the people that I was spending six days a week with at least I eventually at age 15 switched over to freestyle we call it kind of switching to the dark side but there's no dark side.
[00:12:16] But that just meant that I was skiing slope style and half pipe so all those crazy people that you see in X games throwing all the jumps and in the half pipe that was my sport.
[00:12:29] It must have been fun to add in creativity to that so all of a sudden now you are the the choreographer of your own sport which a lot of athletes don't get to do right so that is something that you get to marry this super.
[00:12:44] You know physical thing with a super you know super creative thing and and and compete.
[00:12:51] I love exactly that's like my perfect if you could describe what I love in life and I think that's why I love real estate you just encapsulated it you know community competitiveness being able to be creative and really what it taught me is the power of visualization.
[00:13:10] Oh let's talk about that when you're skiing there are not many places or opportunities to try tricks out other than on the snow so from a from a pretty young age I remember I was probably about 15 or 16 years old in one of my I think it was the US open it was one of my first big big contests and my coach.
[00:13:34] I basically needed to try a trick that I had never done before but I knew that if I didn't pull this I was not going to make it to the next grouping and it was actually me versus my mentor in that grouping oh my gosh it's like straight out of a movie yeah.
[00:13:52] There are a bird who pretty much is the anyone that knows women's free style or free style skiing she invented it I mean she is she was the best mentor but it was me versus her and I was just in my coach call me down he said Athena you remember these hours that you have spent visualizing yourself landing tricks.
[00:14:15] Now is the time sit at the top of the course take yourself through the course in your head visualize yourself landing every trick and if you can't visualize yourself landing then you need to not stop and stop working on that until you do because the brain is a muscle so what I was doing was creating you know it's basically neuro plasticity that I'm creating neuro pathways convinced my brain that I'm not going to do it.
[00:14:44] I know how to do this movement and even though I physically haven't done it yet in my mind I have so I realize from a very young age the power of visualization and I believe that that is a pillar in my life and all of our lives as professionals and entrepreneurs today as we're always setting goals we're looking ahead we're looking at the future we're visualizing where we want to be.
[00:15:11] But if we can get really concrete on those details of what that win looks like what does it landing that trick look like to you is it you know approaching an entirely different demographic in your market by door knocking or introducing yourself hosting events like what are the concrete steps at action plan that you're going to be able to take to get to where you want to go.
[00:15:38] And you know what I stopped that landing it was my first 10 80 in a competition actually on snow period and and I you know I made it to finals in my first year so the power of visualization is something that even someone that has been you know a supporter and believer in it my entire life it easily goes away when real estate and life kind of.
[00:16:05] Sure we live we live in a very physical world that we can see touch in here and we don't always remember to go in and rehearse right there's there's external rehearsal which is great and then there's internal rehearsal which every athlete that I've ever spoken to is is a big fan of.
[00:16:25] And it's something that I even just now started realizing that on what I do and I'm curious to get I want to hear how you do it when I drive to work now I used to listen to podcasts or music and I only have a 10 minute drive it's very quick but you know what i'm not going to do that going forward because.
[00:16:42] I could spend that 10 minutes just thinking about what do I want to accomplish today but not even just for the to do's who do I want to be today what skills I want to embody how do what if I become 1% more effective.
[00:16:55] I'm just a positive at x what if I just yeah yeah and so just this idea of really thinking act and then acting as if in my head like i'm imagining I can land out that sale or I can you know do x y or z and just pretending that I that it's possible and seeing what that might feel like and you know it it's interesting because the very least if nothing else it primes me for when I get to work and i'm like okay now I know at least what I need to do today.
[00:17:24] Tell me how you do visualization yeah so and I incorporated into my life and business in so many different ways and like I said it is one of those things that.
[00:17:35] You know as real tears I think we had we're constantly inundated with shiny objects and things to do and and there's not enough hours in the day so you have to be very intentional about how you're spending your time and for me I have to be very intentional about.
[00:17:49] How I'm using my mind because it is really our minds are such an incredible valuable tool that we have to use at our disposal to create what what it is we want so I I honestly a lot of my.
[00:18:06] I do a lot of work with introspection whether that's their meditation breath work you know you name it i've tried it or or or most supporter of it probably but I love to write out in at least once a month who my ideal client is what my ideal transaction looks like from start to finish I want detail a detailed story about exactly how something interaction.
[00:18:35] The first interaction I make with this new client to you know well pass the closing table sitting at their new dinner table.
[00:18:43] The reminiscing on our house hunt so I I do that at least once a month where i'm i'm really checking in with myself because I think when we when we start real estate i've been in the business about 10 years now and when you start real estate and even over the last couple of years.
[00:19:01] We're more in a space of yes yes yes yes because that's what you have to do to build your business you know we're constantly hustling you're saying yes to everything spreading yourself very thin now that is that is the world of real estate but at a certain point you have to learn what your boundaries are.
[00:19:20] Who you have to be intentional with how you're spending your time who you're connecting with are you showing up authentically I always say real estate is is not rocket science it's reps so you need to make sure that you're out there getting those reps but at a certain point.
[00:19:38] There has to be the boundaries that you create to say no because otherwise you're never going to learn how to take care of yourself you won't take care of the clients you do have and you don't have that time to really reflect and be intentional about okay what does my ideal business look like.
[00:19:55] And now that I have that written out in the present tense like it's happening I fully believe you have to put your brain in that mode then what are the action steps that I need to take to get there yeah you just work backwards exactly and and that can be really difficult to do it when we're busy but I definitely like for my team we do an exercise quarterly that that is really based around what how how our lives are balanced and I think.
[00:20:25] I don't believe in balance honestly I think that's a little bit.
[00:20:28] But we try we try to get as close as we can exactly so we were every quarter do the same exercise just so that we can look back over the years and reflect but we look at our two biggest struggles in the seven pillars of life which is something a coach taught me and it's self family friends money work spirituality and self care.
[00:20:52] No I already said self missing one but you you basically write your two biggest struggles in each area and then from that you're going to flip flip it over and write two goal two small actionable goals based on each of those struggles and what you're doing is creating a visual blueprint for yourself for what to focus on and something that you can come back to you know these are not supposed to be huge new years resolutions where you're entire life.
[00:21:22] I like this supposed to change but like you said how can I show up one person better every day and follow in you know look at where my where I'm not as strong in my business and my life and focus on those items because if we're not taking care of ourselves I mean I'm the first to admit you know I'm battling multiple chronic illnesses my body will completely stop working if I do not take care of myself.
[00:21:51] And even sometimes when I do I mean there will be days where my joints are swollen shut I can't walk I can't move I probably have a migraine so bad I can't see so how am I preparing even for though for right because that isn't that's and that's the real so it's like what is is is so this idea of not also not resisting what is like what we don't have to like the reality but we have to accept that it's real right so in your case it's not going to be a real thing.
[00:22:21] Hey I do I have these illnesses and they're not fun and I wish I didn't have them but I do and they're going to get in the way of my work because I don't know when they're going to hit.
[00:22:32] And even if I take perfect care of myself they seem to show up sometimes so this idea of the boy scout motto always be prepared is I'm sure you have plans when this happens I do this is the best thing I know to do and and I'll and then you'll test.
[00:22:48] Yeah did it work did it help me did it not I'll try and I suspect you are constantly looking for solutions as well.
[00:22:55] Oh my goodness yeah so I have a couple you have such a reason questions first of all thank you and it's like I you know one of one of my my coaches taught me from a very early time you know probably before I got sick.
[00:23:11] Was the value of a bringing consistency to your schedule so that you know you know exactly what needs to get done in a week and you can time block but then if I have a day that I'm not able to do what that is I can move some of those most important green times to a different day.
[00:23:33] But what it really I give 100% of the fact that I am here doing what I love to do which I truly I I will be that corny REALTOR for life that is saying how much I love real estate I love real estate so the fact that I get to have a career that allows me the opportunity to you know the competitor in me had always wanted to push through the really bad days and that was one of the biggest struggles is learning that.
[00:24:03] But that is not helping me you know there are instances where i'm not going to feel good most a lot of times but I need to show up as my best but there are times where I need to say hey you know what the reason I have such incredible teammates the reason I have curated this small but mighty group of humans around me is so that I can take care of myself when I need to.
[00:24:30] And I think culture and community are really the you know two of the biggest pillars of my of my business I've worked with you know I have the I have three people on my team that are I've worked with for you know three ten and eight years and they have my back more than anyone ever could and I know that I can trust them with my clients.
[00:24:57] And I think that trust is built through authenticity so at the beginning when you say you know thank you for sharing with your illness it's you know this is a part of my my daily life and it's something that all my clients need to know about and they need to know that this is not going to affect their ability to have the most successful transaction I will be present.
[00:25:22] If I have a day where I'm getting I do four plasma transfusions a month for instance that is four days in the hospital literally getting all the blood taken out of my body go through a center fuse take my plasma out and replace it with like bottled synthetic plasma.
[00:25:41] It's like it's like dialysis for but for a healthy person for somebody that's an athlete that you know you know typically if if we're and I don't mean to.
[00:25:50] No yeah I'm not anyone who's in dialysis was like that's awful but a lot of a lot of that you know people lived healthier lives that might actually prevent some of that you're in a situation where you have to do it no matter what.
[00:26:01] yeah hopefully not forever but I you know having that support system but also having structure and I think that's really what last year the last year and a half have taught me in particular is I want to do it all I'm you know I've got I was a one man sport skier i'm an only child the art of delegation is something that has not naturally to me.
[00:26:27] And as a leader I believe that one of the greatest skills you need to have is to be able to delegate effectively kindly and in a way that you are providing value and honestly that is how I got my start in real estate is I found I never in a million years would have expected myself to be in real estate but I you know after my ninth ACL surgery my doctor looked at me and he's like I think I you're going to need a new replacement.
[00:26:57] I'm a way before your 30 if you keep this up this was long before I was 30 it's been a while but I looked at him and it was just I it was time to hang up the skis so I did that I worked with an interior incredible interior design firm but I was bored out of my mind I realized that with that skiing background I needed to be responsible for my own success so
[00:27:21] however much I was going to put in I would get out of it and it wasn't just sitting behind a desk nine to five and kind of counting the hours down I wanted something that I was building relationships I was on my feet running around every day no day was the same if I work you know if I work four hours a day I was probably not going to go for it wasn't going to go very well if I you know one of my mentors at the time that said I think that you are the
[00:27:50] least experienced agent here you should be at the office well before anyone else gets here and well after law after anyone else gets leaves excuse me so I kind of brought that mentality early on to okay now how do I follow a top producing agent who was actually the owner of my small brokerage at the time he still is John Stegner thank you he let me follow everything he did for the first time
[00:28:20] I was a year of my career and this allowed me to I I'm a firm believer that you unfortunately real estate school from my experience and anyone I talk to doesn't teach you much you know you you learn the basics you learn how to pass the test and that's about so so when you you're let out into the wild so to speak I think there's a lack of footing or understanding where where to go and how to spend your time in your life
[00:28:50] and how to be intentional and what to be doing and if you can find a mentor that you respect them not only from a business sense but from the way that they do business how are they as a person I admired so much and admired John because he believed so firmly in relationship based business he wants to ensure that any client that he has whether it's someone he's helped you know multiple times or a first client
[00:29:19] they are going to be wanting to have him over for dinner months after the closing or two years down the line when they need and someone who's amazing for H back that that he's going to be their first call so when I saw this you know and he's a he's array of sunshine he's one of those people you you're around and you're automatically want to be better and I think that also speaks volume surrounding yourself with people that that bring out the light and you know
[00:29:48] and to be able to watch every call he made every market analysis do showings with him open houses it gave me the reps that I needed to understand it as much as I could and then one of the most valuable things he said to me which I know was in the
[00:30:08] little an episode I was listening to with with Lindsay this morning was the greatest thing you can do as a young engine or a very experienced agent if you don't know something is you say you know what I don't know that off the top of my head right now but I have such great resources let me get back to you because when you're starting in real estate it is so easy to want to pretend that you know everything and that you have an answer for everything because you don't want to
[00:30:38] be you know you don't want to look green to your client but by spitballing an answer that you're not totally sure of a you're putting yourself in huge liability but be you're not actually serving your client so that was one honestly one of the best pieces of advice I've ever got and and I still use it today if I don't know something that's not you know there's no one in the world that knows every single little thing about
[00:31:08] you know the intricacies of any job but we have resources available at our fingertips whether it's a coach a mentor your managing broker another broker in your office you're surrounded by people that actually do want to help you if you will open your mouth and ask for it.
[00:31:27] Yeah I want to talk to you about you know one thing that I love about athletes I think it's taught it's it's built into being a professional or competitive athlete is this idea of learning how to lose and because of course you know very few people have perfect records and and even just in practice you're going to fail you're going to you know and again it's I love that because what's great about it is if you know if done correctly it builds resilience it it makes you
[00:31:56] okay with not getting the result you want because you're not always going to get that and also having an illness is similar because they're like you said there's days where you've done everything correctly and it still doesn't show up the health doesn't show up and in the way that you want it so you have to accept that let's talk I want to talk about that you know people do they they look at people who are highly successful people on the show competitive skiers like you've been in the past you're now actually a top REALTOR and they just see the success because people typically aren't posting on social
[00:32:26] hey had this massive failure today but so many falls on the face yeah yeah and and let's let's talk about that what what when you don't land that deal that you want or that client or something goes wrong that you know maybe you missed it you missed something or maybe it was you know me sometimes things just happen to us and other times we just drop the ball so I dropped the ball this weekend on a guest for another podcast I do completely forgot about the the thing I've never done that before and I dropped the ball and and and it's
[00:32:56] and I felt really terrible about it because that's what you should feel when you drop the ball but at the same time I had to pick myself up and I had to you know I had to continue going and and realize like I'm human it you know I make mistakes everyone does but let's talk about that when you make an error you know and and athletes are so great at this because it typically is like no big deal how do you not get stuck in that mistake yeah so that is a huge challenge for me because I'm absolutely I'm a planner by nature
[00:33:26] and a kind of a perfectionist from from skiing because if we you know weren't listening to our coaches it would be okay take your skis off do 50 burpees in your ski booth
[00:33:38] and we're peace in a ski booth like a burpees but if they weren't least you know terrible enough to do put heavy ski boots on and then do that yeah so there was always you know that that is an extreme
[00:33:51] sense of accountability but in day to day you know when I came into real estate I think I had scored like in the 98th percentile in terms of like planning and I believe I had my life planned I was like this I'm going to do this this this this this this and that really translated into my day which translated into my actions but I quickly got you know lost my health after that
[00:34:18] and what I learned is that anytime you tell life what your plan is it's going to like it's a joke nothing ever goes to plan unfortunately when it's whether it's a real estate transaction whether it's something personally you're going through life does not go to plan but our ability to pivot is the the one element that is in our hands so when we drop the ball I'm a firm believer in saying
[00:34:47] first of all I'm sorry you know this is not acceptable I don't like to I don't run my business this way but I but I'm human I I would really appreciate you know the opportunity to show you a better experience yeah
[00:35:02] taking note of that but not you know there's a it's a really difficult not to take it personally when you mess up because you want to give your clients the absolute best you want to be perfect for them
[00:35:15] but what we what I've realized and I don't again I don't know that I would have really learned this about myself or how to handle it if I had not gotten sick was that there are going to be so many instances throughout our lives in a multitude of ways where we do not you know meet whether it's something that people even notice or they don't notice right there are always going to be things that we can do better and if we focus on
[00:35:45] how we failed how we didn't succeed at that that is where our energy is going and it's going to your client is going to feel it so instead I like to think of like anytime I'm in a funk or I do you know I mess up I like to just take a deep breath and remind myself of the world word pivot every year I try and pick a word that I'm going to focus on yeah
[00:36:08] and the art of the pivot I think is something that we do not focus on ever but if we can take a negative experience with a client whether it's losing out on a home or you know having to terminate based on a really bad inspection on their dream home
[00:36:27] I like to say okay I'm going to take a moment I'm going to pivot my head so that I can then provide valuable insight about a new plan forward because life isn't it not an adventure unless there's a U-turn or two or ten
[00:36:42] so there's a lot lots of U-turns in real estate and I think if you can guide your your clients by letting them know that when everything is supposed to come together when you you know it's like visualizing that trick when you have gotten
[00:36:58] when you when everything is lined up as it should be you will get into the property you're supposed to be in and after ten years I fall I firmly believe that and I don't think it's woo woo
[00:37:10] I think it's you know if something it does not work out and with your client with real estate it's because something else is out there a better home is there for your client so instead of seeing this as a negative dark cloud
[00:37:25] we try and reframe it into an opportunity and that's what I try and do with mistakes because mistakes give us the opportunity to learn to grow to do better next time
[00:37:35] and I think if you take accountability trans be transparent about that whether it's your fault or no fault of yours but still something that's greatly affecting your client
[00:37:47] put your like take accountability and let them know how that is going to change the way that you operate as a team together because that is your team your clients are your team
[00:38:00] yeah and you want to make sure that as the leader you have a clear approach plan system structure for them to move forward because it helps it helps us to not say and stay and sit in the negative
[00:38:15] yeah and that's a hard thing not to do and anything you're going through in life is still in the negative
[00:38:21] yeah it's it's I find that when it comes to interpersonal relationships when when we let someone down whether it's our fault or not they feel let down
[00:38:30] really most of the time again this isn't there are exceptions to this but most I would say 99% of my experiences have been when I've made a mistake
[00:38:39] people just want me to apologize take ownership of it have some empathy for how that affected them and then also say in here's what I'm doing now to correct it or here's what I'm doing to move forward
[00:38:51] but again it's it's funny because I've found that people typically are really accepting of that no matter what the mistake is if as long like I made the mistake I didn't show up for a podcast which is like the very thing I have to do every time and I didn't
[00:39:05] and and I wish I wish I had but I was cooking I literally went straight to
[00:39:10] I was funny I literally I wasn't even like sitting around I was doing meal prep I was I was cooking for three hours
[00:39:15] it just it just slipped my mind anyway so as it happens and and at first I didn't want to face the person I was so embarrassed I was ashamed I said and then I went okay I'm human we all make mistakes and I said what do I need to do right now it's like I need to apologize
[00:39:31] and I need to say you pick the time and the day next time and I'll be there because I owe that to you and if you don't want to do it anymore because of this I understand that too I apologize I don't want to waste your
[00:39:41] way sorry for wasting value your time and value your time and and he was no problem let's get it rescheduled and you know that's that's how most people respond to things but it is funny there are lots of times lots of people I've met we're saying I'm sorry is a hard thing they just either can't do it or they won't do it and I have
[00:40:02] yeah well they say pride go with before the fall or something yeah it's it's it's and you know too I want to talk
[00:40:11] about gratitude because you are somebody that I suspect has an intentional gratitude process um program
[00:40:18] if you run it you know yeah I can I can I can tell and I think our audience can tell that you seem to be a very
[00:40:26] grateful person despite having some pretty serious challenges um and let's talk about that what how do
[00:40:33] you practice gratitude absolutely so I'm a firm believer and when I lost my health that um sense of planning my everything that I had ever learned and cultivated in my life went out the window
[00:40:49] and of course with that came with a period of grieving like it I was not just oh I got Lyme disease which turned into every autoimmune disease but I'm still grateful like I definitely believe that there is
[00:41:03] a cycle of you know like you have to mourn you have to let yourself feel how much that sucks but you can't let yourself get stuck there yeah
[00:41:14] and I believe that one of the most critical things that I've learned over the last nine years of being of having to health challenges is having my toolkit for what is going to keep me in the right head space what are my go-tos for when I'm really not in a good head space
[00:41:33] or I'm having a really hard time physically um you know stress for instance makes my body flare up
[00:41:41] yeah and that's something we deal with every day so I have to be very intentional about what I'm feeding myself so to speak
[00:41:50] and that includes and I have a huge amount of what they call brain fog like I don't know if you've ever had a big meal and you just can't think and you're like ex-a-th-
[00:42:02] yeah well unfortunately Lyme disease attacks the brain and it causes swelling and I live in a sense a state of brain fog so for me having routines and having structure is absolutely pivotal for me
[00:42:16] so I've created like a toolkit of of course every night I actually do gratitude twice a day so usually you know usually you hear once a day but I've got very firm morning and nighttime routines
[00:42:32] that don't take a huge amount of time like anyone can implement routine into their life that is going to exponentially change their lives
[00:42:42] and for me this looks like first journaling out anything negative that happened during the day that I just need to get out
[00:42:48] you know I think that it's really important to come face to face with your challenges with your fears with your
[00:42:57] mistakes so anything that you need to get out get it out on paper but then take take everything negative that just happened and then write at least five
[00:43:08] gratitude right five things every day that you're grateful for that are not the same as the day before don't write the same things like things every day
[00:43:16] we have so much to be grateful for like like I said I am the luckiest sick person in the universe I have incredible access to medicine
[00:43:25] I have access to medicine I have health insurance they don't I mean they're useless but I still have it I have a supportive family a supportive real estate team
[00:43:36] and I have opportunities like this where where I can connect with others that are going through struggles to me that is something that I am grateful for every single day but there are a hundred million other things that I'm grateful for
[00:43:51] sure so making sure that I'm focusing on the good and not focusing on the fact that my hands feel like they're in a fire because of the nerve pain
[00:44:00] next I really really you know I I try every night I always say I'm gonna I've become a very big night out due to Lyme disease it's a lot it's a nocturnal bug which is very strange
[00:44:14] my entire life I was up at 5 a.m. to go to the gym before the mountain and and now I usually am like I can't sleep until 4 a.m. so what do I do at this time
[00:44:23] but I read I I take something and and usually it's you know something for self improvement like I'm reading atomic habits right now and I take that into
[00:44:34] every day it's how can I be one percent better and how can I take so much we you know our access to information right now is so incredible
[00:44:45] we are so lucky to be living right now just because I grew up you know I funny I grew up pre internet and internet the internet didn't even really become a thing
[00:44:55] browsers like around 94 or so and that's when I started college and you sort of had information access but even then it wasn't you know
[00:45:03] yeah right you were still heading to the library you were still looking at psycho pedias and I used to fantasize about just
[00:45:10] getting answers to things and now we are so lucky especially with things like chat
[00:45:14] cheaply it's not always accurate but but it's we can we can literally ask questions and it's like we have that
[00:45:20] Oracle at Delphi that you know we we would yeah so we're right so there's so much to learn yeah like how are you
[00:45:28] and you know one of my coaches says how are you every day is an opportunity that you might meet the person that changes your life
[00:45:37] and how do you want to show up how does the person that you want to be to meet that person how do they present themselves and show up every day
[00:45:47] so what do you need to do mentally physically to get yourself into the head space where you feel confident that if you met the person
[00:45:57] the you know the developer that was going to hire you to sell for the rest of your life with them that that could happen any day
[00:46:06] yeah what are you and you don't get to pick the day no you don't it can be a worst day ever but that's why it's so important to make sure that we have these practices in our lives
[00:46:18] and for me like you said I think it's amazing to sit in the car and be really intentional with with how with your thoughts
[00:46:26] and and kind of use that as a time for introspection for me I know that my car time is my time to catch up on podcasts on master classes on audio books like we spend so much time in our cars
[00:46:43] but this is actually a gift yeah it's learning it's a learning machine it's literally like you are just sitting in your car and you have the opportunity to learn just about
[00:46:54] anything you could ever dream of from the best of the best almost literally like and if you're not in a good mood and you're headed to a big meeting
[00:47:04] you know maybe that looks like pumping some rock and roll and just getting getting your game based on maybe it's like listening to add my let talk about something really positive
[00:47:15] or you know what is that tool for you that's going to get you in a head space because it's crazy if you pay attention to how quickly
[00:47:23] that pivot can happen from woe is me like I do not feel grateful for anything I just want to go to bed to okay I can do this and that is something to be
[00:47:38] grateful for is your routines the way that you're feeding yourself the way that you're you know maybe you have a go to person whether it's your
[00:47:48] spouse or a business partner a mentor and you're just you say I'm really struggling through this like can you help
[00:47:55] you know talk it out with me at least it doesn't have to be a solution but again this is all your toolkit that you we all need to be
[00:48:05] building and then the last thing I love doing affirmations in the present tense which is really goes along with writing out what my
[00:48:13] perfect client is but every night just writing out like I am healthy I am killing I'm strong I'm successful I'm powerful like you have to our brains are
[00:48:25] are so incredible in the way that they have the ability to to relearn muscle memory as what we'd call it and skiing but for muscles
[00:48:35] but your brain has neuroplasticity meaning if you get yourself into a state like for at night time I love to do
[00:48:43] binaural beats basically different frequencies yeah because it puts your brain in a state where it is able to
[00:48:52] become more like your your neural pathways will be open so what am I how am I feeding my brain positive
[00:49:00] messages how am I rewiring my limiting beliefs that we all have like we all have so much built up
[00:49:08] whether it's trauma from childhood or year whatever it may be that we might not even realize is there and I
[00:49:16] I'm really grateful to live in a generation in a time where we talk about this kind of thing we talk about
[00:49:22] you know I go to therapy EMBR every week and I swear this woman has completely changed the way that I am
[00:49:31] able to approach healing well let's I want to talk about EMDR for some sort of what that is is
[00:49:37] I movement desensitization desensitization yeah yeah something I'm like I don't know if I've ever met
[00:49:44] anyone the news that I've the sponsor so here and I'm going to overly simplify it and I'm going to
[00:49:49] make it and I don't I've never done it myself but I know essentially what it's attempt is to do it it
[00:49:56] works really well with trauma it works really well with PTSD things like that and here's why and you
[00:50:03] really ties into what you're talking about and and this doesn't sound real estate related for our
[00:50:07] listeners but it yeah it is because we you were saying about these these neural pathways they become
[00:50:13] thick for sort of highways in our brain and based on repetition and they just become our go-toes our
[00:50:20] brains were we're we're we're conditioned to respond in certain phrase we're behaviorists that
[00:50:26] this is you know we just do things we do things automatically and what happens is the things we
[00:50:34] learn when we were younger maybe some things weren't so helpful but we still learn them and they
[00:50:38] became you know stuck we get stuck in it and and what eat what I movement desensitization I believe
[00:50:43] does is it helps change break those neural pathways by by literally moving eyeballs around and
[00:50:50] doing some things but basically just singlets let's scratch the record that's running so it can't
[00:50:55] really play the same and then we're going to build some new pathways we're going to build some
[00:50:59] new records that are more intentional and and boy I you know it's yeah it's it's a it's a legitimate
[00:51:07] therapeutic technique it's it's been you know it's one of those things that doesn't sound like it
[00:51:10] should work but it does I don't understand still I'm like how did that just unlock this that
[00:51:17] allowed me to process whatever limiting belief that was so that we could create something new from it
[00:51:23] well I will I will tell everyone else too if you were looking to develop more skills around being
[00:51:29] able to manage your emotional state the best that I've ever found I've been studying this for now
[00:51:33] four or five years is dialectic behavior therapy yeah so everyone out there if you're struggling
[00:51:40] with emotional regulation distress tolerance interpersonal effectiveness things like this is what
[00:51:46] it's for it is all skills based it teaches you how to do things oh you're going to love it you are
[00:51:52] going to love it especially in this industry you look at it you know it I was looking at
[00:51:56] satz yesterday in Denver Metro just for instance 33 or 36% of agents did not renew their licenses
[00:52:04] in 2025 and I think we all know why it has been a very difficult couple of years people are burnt
[00:52:13] out we are burnt out I think that you know we keep looking for last year we're hoping for a new year
[00:52:19] and everything was going to get better and then nothing changed and this year it's like okay
[00:52:24] you know we don't really know what's going to come there might be a couple small decreases with the
[00:52:29] fed it seems like others are moving maybe and by the way just because that happens doesn't mean
[00:52:35] rates will change the last two months yeah exactly last two rate cuts yeah didn't affect a rates
[00:52:43] it all sat yeah usually they're inversely correlated looks like well okay so we have to we've
[00:52:49] really like using these difficult times in business and life to grow our skill set of resiliency
[00:52:59] of grit of how we approach life like it now is of the time and I think oftentimes when you're doing
[00:53:07] things like you know taking an hour a week to do therapy or hour and a half we think of oftentimes
[00:53:15] it's like why should we be working during that time but what we don't realize in what and I felt
[00:53:20] the same way and I I lived but I lived and died by my schedule of no I don't do that kind of
[00:53:28] state like this is my work day but what I didn't realize is that by doing those activities by
[00:53:35] making sure that you're getting your workout in by making sure that you're going to therapy or
[00:53:41] whatever it is for you that's helped cultivating the best parts parts of you and helping you grow as
[00:53:48] a human that is what is going to allow you to overflow into other people's lives to be to show up
[00:53:55] as your best self to have less bad days because you're learning the skills needed to be a successful
[00:54:02] human and we're all human at the end of the day you know whether you're looking at your idols on
[00:54:10] million dollar listing or something I don't know who's idols are but whatever it is like we look
[00:54:17] at these people and you think okay they must work 12 hours a day with absolutely no breaks and
[00:54:24] you can't you know you can't have self care in there but it's what you'd realize when you start
[00:54:30] implementing you know these must-do activities from your toolkit of okay I know that if I don't
[00:54:37] work out a certain number of days a week that I am not going to be as effective mentally,
[00:54:44] emotionally and I'm not going to you know I'll probably be a little bit more irritable so I know
[00:54:49] that if I'm not doing those things that I'm not going to be the best broker I can be for my clients
[00:54:54] so being intentional with our time and recognizing that whatever self care and I think self-care kind
[00:55:03] of has gotten this connotation with it of like going to the spot. Not being luxurious.
[00:55:10] Yeah, you know maybe every once in a while you're celebrating a big win and you should go
[00:55:16] celebrate and go to the four seasons spot or something but no we're talking about the basics
[00:55:22] every day every week that we need to become just as non-negotiable as the green time time
[00:55:30] blocked into your calendar for real estate because that's sharpening your brain. Yeah well look physical
[00:55:36] exercise unfortunately is a non-negotiable if we want to have the energy to do extraordinary
[00:55:42] things even just to do normal things you need it and we know what I've learned too and I'm curious
[00:55:48] to get your thoughts athletes always know this that you don't have to like something you just have
[00:55:53] to do it. You just have to show up. Yeah, you back there's a lot of things I don't like to do if I
[00:56:00] can just get myself to do them then it doesn't like I kept waiting for me to like love doing pull-ups
[00:56:06] or actually I don't mind doing pulse but doing burpees do it well burpees yeah perfect I will
[00:56:11] I will never enjoy doing burpees but it's a really good idea to do a burpee it's a really good idea
[00:56:17] the the data is in it's so I can say well I don't like to do that and then well okay good that's fine
[00:56:24] I don't like to pay my taxes I don't like to do a lot of things in life. I don't think it's hard
[00:56:29] right but and it's it's hard and it hurts and it's painful and all of that is true and I just
[00:56:35] still have to I still get to do it and if I just do it I'll feel proud I'll probably be I'll
[00:56:41] feel so I'll be more proud of myself for doing the thing I don't want to do then the thing I do
[00:56:46] want to do right so it's even it's even it's funny you actually I actually get a bigger benefit
[00:56:51] from doing the thing that I dislike the most but that is really super healthy for me so I used to
[00:56:57] say to myself like I really should like start doing cardio because I was doing weights and I still
[00:57:02] do weights and I kept saying I really should I kept waiting for that motivation to kick in it's like
[00:57:07] oh that's not how it works like I just have to do it I just have to do it and then I'm not
[00:57:12] gonna like it probably okay fine but it's a really good idea and just and just do it and then I
[00:57:18] will be like oh my god DJ you did something you didn't even want to do so so I honestly that's how I
[00:57:23] live every day I mean I I used to spring out of bed in the morning now getting out of bed is
[00:57:30] literally the most painful difficult experience ever so I have to I litter I have like okay I'm
[00:57:36] gonna get my podcast on that's gonna motivate me to like drag myself out of bed and then I'm
[00:57:43] gonna take a shower and it's gonna be so hard because I'm exhausted but it's like celebrating
[00:57:47] those small victories and then when you start can like when you continue showing up for yourself when
[00:57:54] you don't want to it creates a sense of self like accomplishment and you can feel proud of yourself
[00:58:02] for saying you know I did not you know I didn't think I was capable of showing up today I didn't
[00:58:08] think that you know I I could have let a million things get in the way of that workout but when
[00:58:15] you're finished doing it not only do you have that sense of accomplishment but you've also
[00:58:21] you're building again those resiliency you're building a neural pathway that shows you you can do
[00:58:27] hard things you can accomplish anything you want but it's not fun so don't anyone that thinks that
[00:58:35] you know all of this is is sunshine and rainbows it's like no a good majority of being an adult is
[00:58:42] difficult and and but if you recognize how you feel before and after you do something you know my
[00:58:50] first mentor always said the heavy light test if you and I think this goes well with real estate is
[00:58:58] there are so many avenues to success and if you try and do everything it's a not gonna be authentic to
[00:59:06] you but be you're not gonna have fun like it's and if you're not finding the activities in your life
[00:59:12] they make you feel lighter when you're done they make you feel heavier they need to be rid of
[00:59:18] the heavy and it's a really easy way to determine you know where you should focus your energy
[00:59:25] especially like in real estate if you're someone that hates making cold calls and you feel heavy
[00:59:30] and down afterward you probably should not put that on you know that probably shouldn't be your focus
[00:59:36] of your day and the good news is there's a million other avenues yeah you don't you know it's
[00:59:41] there are some sales jobs where you have to make cold calls and that's that's a tough position
[00:59:46] to be and maybe you should find another job if you if you hate it that much but good news about
[00:59:50] real estate is you okay you don't want to do cold calls great there's seven other things you can
[00:59:54] try that you might enjoy and if you're authentic to it I really believe that's where you find success
[01:00:01] and and the easiest way for me in life to understand you know whether it's spending time with certain
[01:00:08] people doing certain activities do I feel lighter or do I feel heavier and you can apply that to
[01:00:14] anything in life and it will really help guide you in making decisions on where your time
[01:00:20] should be spent because it'll help you show up as your most authentic light self I love that I've
[01:00:26] never heard of that heavy light test I'm going to start applying that to my partner it's one of the
[01:00:31] best things I ever heard and I want to talk I want to wrap up with one thing because you've given
[01:00:37] a so much of your time I want to wrap up in being coached let's talk about the importance you
[01:00:43] were professional athlete every professional athlete I've ever met has a coach now you're a real
[01:00:48] estate agent you're a top real estate agent do you still have a coach oh yeah I have two were at the
[01:00:53] moment usually I have two a business coach and a real estate coach and I mean then that doesn't
[01:00:59] even get into like the therapy coaching or whatever sure but no I'm I'm a firm believer that no
[01:01:04] matter what industry I mean for the most part in life there should be someone looking from a
[01:01:11] bird's eye view over your business and helping you determine like understand where your blind spots
[01:01:17] are helping you understand where your time is going and what your natural talents are and how to
[01:01:25] cultivate them but also keeping you accountable I mean I've been with a coaching program I was
[01:01:31] with a coaching program for six years and they helped create basically a grid of activities that
[01:01:37] I needed to get done every week and you know it would be like five face to face meals 10 break 10
[01:01:47] face to like zooms or coffee breaks a bunch of phone calls open houses and handwritten notes
[01:01:55] newsletter and then I started putting in like gym you know I started putting in the my
[01:02:00] non-negotiables for health as well but if I would turn this in at the end of the week and there
[01:02:05] were blank spots it meant that I was donating $10 to charity per blank but I did not fill in that week
[01:02:12] so it created accountability it but they also you know we don't know what we don't know and especially
[01:02:19] as a you know a former athlete I've always had that like get it done yourself mentality and what
[01:02:25] coaching has taught me is that we are not meant to do everything ourselves we're meant to find what
[01:02:33] what our purpose is what we're really good at hone those skills see where we can improve our other
[01:02:39] skills that you know are are things that we need to do in order to be successful but not necessarily
[01:02:47] our green time and then also recognizing what your weaknesses are and learning how to delegate
[01:02:53] and learning how to work with a team because we really don't understand our blind spots when we're
[01:02:59] running from one thing to the next thing to the next thing and you don't have that time to be
[01:03:04] really reflecting and intentional so for me coaching is by far the most valuable gift you can give
[01:03:13] yourself it's expensive yes will it pay for itself tenfold absolutely if you find but also
[01:03:20] recognizing that there are so many different types of coaching like different type I guess just
[01:03:27] different types of coaching and you need to really do your research go to conferences talk to
[01:03:34] different coaches you know on zooms really interview them as well to find who you feel you align with
[01:03:40] from not only a real estate standpoint but from how they live their lives because you want to be
[01:03:47] learning from someone who you admire in all aspects of life not someone who's selling you know 300
[01:03:54] homes a year but is divorced because they were never home lost custody of their kids you know
[01:04:00] sleeps under the desk like that is not the person probably that you want to be learning from and
[01:04:05] less unless that's how you want to end up sure understanding that you're you know we we all need
[01:04:12] accountability and we all need someone that's not afraid to give it to us straight and that's what
[01:04:18] coaches are there for yeah I love it well I think that is a perfect place for us to wrap up this
[01:04:25] episode I would love to continue talking with you and I'm definitely going to have you back
[01:04:31] because you have a lot of wisdom and you've given a lot of your own personal processes to our
[01:04:38] audience I hope our audience can take some of those and apply them to their own life this is this is
[01:04:44] you know we're not in practice this is the real the real world and we get to make decisions and we
[01:04:50] get to to to architect our own life but it requires some intentionality and it's time to slow down
[01:04:58] you know I suspect you probably don't spend a ton of time scrolling on social media maybe you do
[01:05:04] but we all have ways in which we you know we we you know probably should spend our time more
[01:05:10] effectively I certainly fall into I mean I waste time in lots of ways but this is where coaching
[01:05:17] comes in and this is where having other people in our life we don't have to do it all ourselves
[01:05:21] and in fact we can't and so this idea of having a community you've got a community of coaches you
[01:05:26] know you talked about you have health coaches you have business coaches you have you know I bet you
[01:05:31] have coaches for every part I call my team my coaches too me too yeah also I love it I always I
[01:05:38] always tell people this that I have somebody that wakes me up every morning at 6 a.m she calls me
[01:05:43] and it sounds I don't know how it sounds yeah well and the reason I do it is it's it's not easy for me
[01:05:51] to do that and and I've become better at it but I know I won't let somebody else down I'll let myself
[01:05:56] down easily but I won't let somebody else down so now I wake up five minutes before she calls me
[01:06:02] and I message her and that makes me feel yeah it just makes me feel proud now yeah but again it's
[01:06:08] systems like you have systems but you need other people to help you with your system sometimes and
[01:06:14] it's there's no shame in that I used to be kind of embarrassed like I have up 48 I still have to have
[01:06:18] somebody wake me up but I used to have someone have to come to my house and physically wake me up
[01:06:24] because my body just wanted to sleep 24 hours a day I hope to have people come wake me up in the
[01:06:31] morning at my house and I'm like that you know that's humbling I do what you gotta do sometimes yeah
[01:06:38] yeah and and and this idea too is this we can rely upon others yeah and others and some people will
[01:06:44] let us down and some people won't be there for the entire journey of our lives but some people will
[01:06:49] and some people will come and go but boy isn't it great that you can that you can allow yourself
[01:06:54] to fall apart a little bit here and there and let other people prop you up so you can fall apart
[01:06:59] it's it's beautiful yeah yeah that really is the heart of authenticity and and being vulnerable and
[01:07:07] you know we're in an industry that's very one person dominant and if we can build community
[01:07:14] it's the greatest gift we can give ourselves love it well Athena Brownson is our guest today
[01:07:21] she won't want everybody to follow her on Instagram Athena Brownson Reelter we will have a link

[01:07:48] that's you know it's funny I'll give you one quick pivot story as I'm gonna next thing this just
[01:07:52] happened to me a couple weeks ago I woke up and I was feeling really blue it just happened I
[01:07:56] I couldn't even I couldn't even tell you why but but it was it was there just happened and I was
[01:08:01] like really a little bit depressed and sad and I and it was funny is I looked out at my my windows
[01:08:08] in my condo and I saw the sun shining and I go that's well that's something to be grateful for but
[01:08:12] then I thought but is that enough for me to like overcome this blue because I wanted to
[01:08:17] on but I wasn't feeling well but I also wanted to pivot and so I said okay well what would I need to
[01:08:22] think in order to feel differently right now and I said well there's a lot of people that didn't
[01:08:27] wake up today there's a lot of people that yesterday was their last day on this earth I got another day
[01:08:32] like some the universe god whoever somebody gave me another day and at the very least that's an
[01:08:38] opportunity and I go well that's pretty cool and so I just yeah sometimes that's all it needs to be
[01:08:47] right it's like hey um you know everything in my life is falling apart but I'm still here for
[01:08:53] in this moment everything's I'm still fighting yeah and and so sometimes I just love gratitude is

Today could not be more excited to be here. Thank you so much for having me on this lovely Monday morning. It's been a crazy one for you. Well, I'm behind the scenes, restreams started glitching right when our time was starting and I was running a minute late and so Athena has been incredibly kind and sweet and really speaks to her character. She's like so excited. She didn't care that we're starting late. She's just excited to be here and work excited to have her and I'm excited to talk to you and I want to say something right off the bat, which I was saying to you back the backstage, but I want to say it in front of everyone here is that thank you for talking about your illness that you are constantly being challenged with because of course all of us have challenges in our life. We have some of them are illnesses others are all sorts of issues, but we often don't talk about them because you know we keep them in private or we're just too we don't want to talk about it or afraid or or embarrassed or whatever it may be. And I love the fact that you brought that up front and center and really I hope some of our other listeners who might be struggling with physical ailments can relate to what you're going through and also the resilience that you've built as a result of having. That was kind of challenges in your life, so I love the fact I hate the fact that you have this illness. I love the fact I love the fact that you are so resilient as a result of it. Things go home. I always say I'm the luckiest sick person alive and I'm also an open book like my you know I'm a firm believer that if you look back at your life. The greatest moments of growth occur when you're being challenged the most and that all in just doesn't have to be chronic illness it can be divorce it can be a tough market it can be you know family issues like all of our issues are relevant for me unfortunately it's been waking up in excruciating pain for nine years. But it's taught me so much more about who I like the depths of who I am and what I stand for that I I don't know that I ever would have learned how to knock on sick. Yeah, it's funny. I always said if there is a God and if I get to meet God if there is one then the first thing I'm going to say couldn't even just give me five more IQ points. I just needed five or I could but but but second the second thing I would say is why did you have to make everything so worth what the things that are so worthwhile so hard and and God would probably say well that's how it's supposed to be. Yeah, you are without those experience 100% and I yeah, you couldn't have done it a different way. Okay, fine, but but it is it is something to you know it's like the obstacles the way that book by Ryan Holiday I always go back to that during times of really challenges the obstacle is the way even though it's the least fun thing but you know lots of things in life are unfun that are really fulfilling in fact most everything so so but but again I applaud your resilience I applaud your energy and you're just your vibe you you certainly seem to be somebody who really appreciates the good that you do have and so let's talk about that you grew up in Breckenridge so let's talk about what that life was like. Yes, so you definitely do not come across very many Denver native or Breckenridge natives let alone Colorado natives our state is you know we have over 5,000 people a month moving here so to be able to say I'm from Breckenridge is you know at 300 people in my graduating class and that was from four towns so it all collected but as I'm sure you could imagine I grew up on snow so. I believe my dad always says he'd probably be arrested for child abuse at this point because when I was three weeks old he'd strap me to his chest and take me downhill skiing I don't think you could get away with that anymore. Your dad was a professional skier let tell us what was it like to grow up on the slopes but also having a father who this was his his livelihood his life you know what was that like. You know it was something that I don't know that I took as I think I took it for granted a little bit just being so young but the first you know eight years of my life were following him to ski races all over the world he was a professional speed skier so that basically means you get clocked going as fast as you can down the mountain for miles per hour so his record was like 127 miles an hour on skis. Yeah so I grew up in that environment so it really without knowing it of course I was immediately put in with you know with some of the top coaches in the world because I'm in Breckenridge Colorado I've got this father who is a complete maniac in the best way. Who's taught you really taught me what the value of hard work is because I mean he is now 74 he's a car racer he's beating 20 year olds in Le Mans all over the world and he works out three times a day to keep in shape for that while running successful businesses. Isn't it crazy that that people who drive cars there's a there's a physicality to it that we don't we don't realize and you know somebody who's a downhill skis you know skier has to just just grind and practice and it's what it's like milliseconds they're constantly shaving off it's it's just this your dad's a competitor so you have that gene probably as well so what when did you start competing. Yeah so I like I said I was on skis what when I learned how to walk so at two years old I got my first pair of skis from about you know baby age until about 13 I was in a racing program so I ski downhill and I really think that gave me the foundational tools and again access to some of the most hardcore coaches I've ever met and that is honestly the best business school I've ever met. I ever could have asked for was becoming an athlete and that is because they taught me the the value of hard work of showing up when you say you're going to of accountability of vulnerability because they were the people that I was spending six days a week with at least I eventually at age 15 switched over to freestyle we call it kind of switching to the dark side but there's no dark side. But that just meant that I was skiing slope style and half pipe so all those crazy people that you see in X games throwing all the jumps and in the half pipe that was my sport. It must have been fun to add in creativity to that so all of a sudden now you are the the choreographer of your own sport which a lot of athletes don't get to do right so that is something that you get to marry this super. You know physical thing with a super you know super creative thing and and and compete. I love exactly that's like my perfect if you could describe what I love in life and I think that's why I love real estate you just encapsulated it you know community competitiveness being able to be creative and really what it taught me is the power of visualization. Oh let's talk about that when you're skiing there are not many places or opportunities to try tricks out other than on the snow so from a from a pretty young age I remember I was probably about 15 or 16 years old in one of my I think it was the US open it was one of my first big big contests and my coach. I basically needed to try a trick that I had never done before but I knew that if I didn't pull this I was not going to make it to the next grouping and it was actually me versus my mentor in that grouping oh my gosh it's like straight out of a movie yeah. There are a bird who pretty much is the anyone that knows women's free style or free style skiing she invented it I mean she is she was the best mentor but it was me versus her and I was just in my coach call me down he said Athena you remember these hours that you have spent visualizing yourself landing tricks. Now is the time sit at the top of the course take yourself through the course in your head visualize yourself landing every trick and if you can't visualize yourself landing then you need to not stop and stop working on that until you do because the brain is a muscle so what I was doing was creating you know it's basically neuro plasticity that I'm creating neuro pathways convinced my brain that I'm not going to do it. I know how to do this movement and even though I physically haven't done it yet in my mind I have so I realize from a very young age the power of visualization and I believe that that is a pillar in my life and all of our lives as professionals and entrepreneurs today as we're always setting goals we're looking ahead we're looking at the future we're visualizing where we want to be. But if we can get really concrete on those details of what that win looks like what does it landing that trick look like to you is it you know approaching an entirely different demographic in your market by door knocking or introducing yourself hosting events like what are the concrete steps at action plan that you're going to be able to take to get to where you want to go. And you know what I stopped that landing it was my first 10 80 in a competition actually on snow period and and I you know I made it to finals in my first year so the power of visualization is something that even someone that has been you know a supporter and believer in it my entire life it easily goes away when real estate and life kind of. Sure we live we live in a very physical world that we can see touch in here and we don't always remember to go in and rehearse right there's there's external rehearsal which is great and then there's internal rehearsal which every athlete that I've ever spoken to is is a big fan of. And it's something that I even just now started realizing that on what I do and I'm curious to get I want to hear how you do it when I drive to work now I used to listen to podcasts or music and I only have a 10 minute drive it's very quick but you know what i'm not going to do that going forward because. I could spend that 10 minutes just thinking about what do I want to accomplish today but not even just for the to do's who do I want to be today what skills I want to embody how do what if I become 1% more effective. I'm just a positive at x what if I just yeah yeah and so just this idea of really thinking act and then acting as if in my head like i'm imagining I can land out that sale or I can you know do x y or z and just pretending that I that it's possible and seeing what that might feel like and you know it it's interesting because the very least if nothing else it primes me for when I get to work and i'm like okay now I know at least what I need to do today. Tell me how you do visualization yeah so and I incorporated into my life and business in so many different ways and like I said it is one of those things that. You know as real tears I think we had we're constantly inundated with shiny objects and things to do and and there's not enough hours in the day so you have to be very intentional about how you're spending your time and for me I have to be very intentional about. How I'm using my mind because it is really our minds are such an incredible valuable tool that we have to use at our disposal to create what what it is we want so I I honestly a lot of my. I do a lot of work with introspection whether that's their meditation breath work you know you name it i've tried it or or or most supporter of it probably but I love to write out in at least once a month who my ideal client is what my ideal transaction looks like from start to finish I want detail a detailed story about exactly how something interaction. The first interaction I make with this new client to you know well pass the closing table sitting at their new dinner table. The reminiscing on our house hunt so I I do that at least once a month where i'm i'm really checking in with myself because I think when we when we start real estate i've been in the business about 10 years now and when you start real estate and even over the last couple of years. We're more in a space of yes yes yes yes because that's what you have to do to build your business you know we're constantly hustling you're saying yes to everything spreading yourself very thin now that is that is the world of real estate but at a certain point you have to learn what your boundaries are. Who you have to be intentional with how you're spending your time who you're connecting with are you showing up authentically I always say real estate is is not rocket science it's reps so you need to make sure that you're out there getting those reps but at a certain point. There has to be the boundaries that you create to say no because otherwise you're never going to learn how to take care of yourself you won't take care of the clients you do have and you don't have that time to really reflect and be intentional about okay what does my ideal business look like. And now that I have that written out in the present tense like it's happening I fully believe you have to put your brain in that mode then what are the action steps that I need to take to get there yeah you just work backwards exactly and and that can be really difficult to do it when we're busy but I definitely like for my team we do an exercise quarterly that that is really based around what how how our lives are balanced and I think. I don't believe in balance honestly I think that's a little bit. But we try we try to get as close as we can exactly so we were every quarter do the same exercise just so that we can look back over the years and reflect but we look at our two biggest struggles in the seven pillars of life which is something a coach taught me and it's self family friends money work spirituality and self care. No I already said self missing one but you you basically write your two biggest struggles in each area and then from that you're going to flip flip it over and write two goal two small actionable goals based on each of those struggles and what you're doing is creating a visual blueprint for yourself for what to focus on and something that you can come back to you know these are not supposed to be huge new years resolutions where you're entire life. I like this supposed to change but like you said how can I show up one person better every day and follow in you know look at where my where I'm not as strong in my business and my life and focus on those items because if we're not taking care of ourselves I mean I'm the first to admit you know I'm battling multiple chronic illnesses my body will completely stop working if I do not take care of myself. And even sometimes when I do I mean there will be days where my joints are swollen shut I can't walk I can't move I probably have a migraine so bad I can't see so how am I preparing even for though for right because that isn't that's and that's the real so it's like what is is is so this idea of not also not resisting what is like what we don't have to like the reality but we have to accept that it's real right so in your case it's not going to be a real thing. Hey I do I have these illnesses and they're not fun and I wish I didn't have them but I do and they're going to get in the way of my work because I don't know when they're going to hit. And even if I take perfect care of myself they seem to show up sometimes so this idea of the boy scout motto always be prepared is I'm sure you have plans when this happens I do this is the best thing I know to do and and I'll and then you'll test. Yeah did it work did it help me did it not I'll try and I suspect you are constantly looking for solutions as well. Oh my goodness yeah so I have a couple you have such a reason questions first of all thank you and it's like I you know one of one of my my coaches taught me from a very early time you know probably before I got sick. Was the value of a bringing consistency to your schedule so that you know you know exactly what needs to get done in a week and you can time block but then if I have a day that I'm not able to do what that is I can move some of those most important green times to a different day. But what it really I give 100% of the fact that I am here doing what I love to do which I truly I I will be that corny REALTOR for life that is saying how much I love real estate I love real estate so the fact that I get to have a career that allows me the opportunity to you know the competitor in me had always wanted to push through the really bad days and that was one of the biggest struggles is learning that. But that is not helping me you know there are instances where i'm not going to feel good most a lot of times but I need to show up as my best but there are times where I need to say hey you know what the reason I have such incredible teammates the reason I have curated this small but mighty group of humans around me is so that I can take care of myself when I need to. And I think culture and community are really the you know two of the biggest pillars of my of my business I've worked with you know I have the I have three people on my team that are I've worked with for you know three ten and eight years and they have my back more than anyone ever could and I know that I can trust them with my clients. And I think that trust is built through authenticity so at the beginning when you say you know thank you for sharing with your illness it's you know this is a part of my my daily life and it's something that all my clients need to know about and they need to know that this is not going to affect their ability to have the most successful transaction I will be present. If I have a day where I'm getting I do four plasma transfusions a month for instance that is four days in the hospital literally getting all the blood taken out of my body go through a center fuse take my plasma out and replace it with like bottled synthetic plasma. It's like it's like dialysis for but for a healthy person for somebody that's an athlete that you know you know typically if if we're and I don't mean to. No yeah I'm not anyone who's in dialysis was like that's awful but a lot of a lot of that you know people lived healthier lives that might actually prevent some of that you're in a situation where you have to do it no matter what. yeah hopefully not forever but I you know having that support system but also having structure and I think that's really what last year the last year and a half have taught me in particular is I want to do it all I'm you know I've got I was a one man sport skier i'm an only child the art of delegation is something that has not naturally to me. And as a leader I believe that one of the greatest skills you need to have is to be able to delegate effectively kindly and in a way that you are providing value and honestly that is how I got my start in real estate is I found I never in a million years would have expected myself to be in real estate but I you know after my ninth ACL surgery my doctor looked at me and he's like I think I you're going to need a new replacement. I'm a way before your 30 if you keep this up this was long before I was 30 it's been a while but I looked at him and it was just I it was time to hang up the skis so I did that I worked with an interior incredible interior design firm but I was bored out of my mind I realized that with that skiing background I needed to be responsible for my own success so however much I was going to put in I would get out of it and it wasn't just sitting behind a desk nine to five and kind of counting the hours down I wanted something that I was building relationships I was on my feet running around every day no day was the same if I work you know if I work four hours a day I was probably not going to go for it wasn't going to go very well if I you know one of my mentors at the time that said I think that you are the least experienced agent here you should be at the office well before anyone else gets here and well after law after anyone else gets leaves excuse me so I kind of brought that mentality early on to okay now how do I follow a top producing agent who was actually the owner of my small brokerage at the time he still is John Stegner thank you he let me follow everything he did for the first time I was a year of my career and this allowed me to I I'm a firm believer that you unfortunately real estate school from my experience and anyone I talk to doesn't teach you much you know you you learn the basics you learn how to pass the test and that's about so so when you you're let out into the wild so to speak I think there's a lack of footing or understanding where where to go and how to spend your time in your life and how to be intentional and what to be doing and if you can find a mentor that you respect them not only from a business sense but from the way that they do business how are they as a person I admired so much and admired John because he believed so firmly in relationship based business he wants to ensure that any client that he has whether it's someone he's helped you know multiple times or a first client they are going to be wanting to have him over for dinner months after the closing or two years down the line when they need and someone who's amazing for H back that that he's going to be their first call so when I saw this you know and he's a he's array of sunshine he's one of those people you you're around and you're automatically want to be better and I think that also speaks volume surrounding yourself with people that that bring out the light and you know and to be able to watch every call he made every market analysis do showings with him open houses it gave me the reps that I needed to understand it as much as I could and then one of the most valuable things he said to me which I know was in the little an episode I was listening to with with Lindsay this morning was the greatest thing you can do as a young engine or a very experienced agent if you don't know something is you say you know what I don't know that off the top of my head right now but I have such great resources let me get back to you because when you're starting in real estate it is so easy to want to pretend that you know everything and that you have an answer for everything because you don't want to be you know you don't want to look green to your client but by spitballing an answer that you're not totally sure of a you're putting yourself in huge liability but be you're not actually serving your client so that was one honestly one of the best pieces of advice I've ever got and and I still use it today if I don't know something that's not you know there's no one in the world that knows every single little thing about you know the intricacies of any job but we have resources available at our fingertips whether it's a coach a mentor your managing broker another broker in your office you're surrounded by people that actually do want to help you if you will open your mouth and ask for it. Yeah I want to talk to you about you know one thing that I love about athletes I think it's taught it's it's built into being a professional or competitive athlete is this idea of learning how to lose and because of course you know very few people have perfect records and and even just in practice you're going to fail you're going to you know and again it's I love that because what's great about it is if you know if done correctly it builds resilience it it makes you okay with not getting the result you want because you're not always going to get that and also having an illness is similar because they're like you said there's days where you've done everything correctly and it still doesn't show up the health doesn't show up and in the way that you want it so you have to accept that let's talk I want to talk about that you know people do they they look at people who are highly successful people on the show competitive skiers like you've been in the past you're now actually a top REALTOR and they just see the success because people typically aren't posting on social hey had this massive failure today but so many falls on the face yeah yeah and and let's let's talk about that what what when you don't land that deal that you want or that client or something goes wrong that you know maybe you missed it you missed something or maybe it was you know me sometimes things just happen to us and other times we just drop the ball so I dropped the ball this weekend on a guest for another podcast I do completely forgot about the the thing I've never done that before and I dropped the ball and and and it's and I felt really terrible about it because that's what you should feel when you drop the ball but at the same time I had to pick myself up and I had to you know I had to continue going and and realize like I'm human it you know I make mistakes everyone does but let's talk about that when you make an error you know and and athletes are so great at this because it typically is like no big deal how do you not get stuck in that mistake yeah so that is a huge challenge for me because I'm absolutely I'm a planner by nature and a kind of a perfectionist from from skiing because if we you know weren't listening to our coaches it would be okay take your skis off do 50 burpees in your ski booth and we're peace in a ski booth like a burpees but if they weren't least you know terrible enough to do put heavy ski boots on and then do that yeah so there was always you know that that is an extreme sense of accountability but in day to day you know when I came into real estate I think I had scored like in the 98th percentile in terms of like planning and I believe I had my life planned I was like this I'm going to do this this this this this this and that really translated into my day which translated into my actions but I quickly got you know lost my health after that and what I learned is that anytime you tell life what your plan is it's going to like it's a joke nothing ever goes to plan unfortunately when it's whether it's a real estate transaction whether it's something personally you're going through life does not go to plan but our ability to pivot is the the one element that is in our hands so when we drop the ball I'm a firm believer in saying first of all I'm sorry you know this is not acceptable I don't like to I don't run my business this way but I but I'm human I I would really appreciate you know the opportunity to show you a better experience yeah taking note of that but not you know there's a it's a really difficult not to take it personally when you mess up because you want to give your clients the absolute best you want to be perfect for them but what we what I've realized and I don't again I don't know that I would have really learned this about myself or how to handle it if I had not gotten sick was that there are going to be so many instances throughout our lives in a multitude of ways where we do not you know meet whether it's something that people even notice or they don't notice right there are always going to be things that we can do better and if we focus on how we failed how we didn't succeed at that that is where our energy is going and it's going to your client is going to feel it so instead I like to think of like anytime I'm in a funk or I do you know I mess up I like to just take a deep breath and remind myself of the world word pivot every year I try and pick a word that I'm going to focus on yeah and the art of the pivot I think is something that we do not focus on ever but if we can take a negative experience with a client whether it's losing out on a home or you know having to terminate based on a really bad inspection on their dream home I like to say okay I'm going to take a moment I'm going to pivot my head so that I can then provide valuable insight about a new plan forward because life isn't it not an adventure unless there's a U-turn or two or ten so there's a lot lots of U-turns in real estate and I think if you can guide your your clients by letting them know that when everything is supposed to come together when you you know it's like visualizing that trick when you have gotten when you when everything is lined up as it should be you will get into the property you're supposed to be in and after ten years I fall I firmly believe that and I don't think it's woo woo I think it's you know if something it does not work out and with your client with real estate it's because something else is out there a better home is there for your client so instead of seeing this as a negative dark cloud we try and reframe it into an opportunity and that's what I try and do with mistakes because mistakes give us the opportunity to learn to grow to do better next time and I think if you take accountability trans be transparent about that whether it's your fault or no fault of yours but still something that's greatly affecting your client put your like take accountability and let them know how that is going to change the way that you operate as a team together because that is your team your clients are your team yeah and you want to make sure that as the leader you have a clear approach plan system structure for them to move forward because it helps it helps us to not say and stay and sit in the negative yeah and that's a hard thing not to do and anything you're going through in life is still in the negative yeah it's it's I find that when it comes to interpersonal relationships when when we let someone down whether it's our fault or not they feel let down really most of the time again this isn't there are exceptions to this but most I would say 99% of my experiences have been when I've made a mistake people just want me to apologize take ownership of it have some empathy for how that affected them and then also say in here's what I'm doing now to correct it or here's what I'm doing to move forward but again it's it's funny because I've found that people typically are really accepting of that no matter what the mistake is if as long like I made the mistake I didn't show up for a podcast which is like the very thing I have to do every time and I didn't and and I wish I wish I had but I was cooking I literally went straight to I was funny I literally I wasn't even like sitting around I was doing meal prep I was I was cooking for three hours it just it just slipped my mind anyway so as it happens and and at first I didn't want to face the person I was so embarrassed I was ashamed I said and then I went okay I'm human we all make mistakes and I said what do I need to do right now it's like I need to apologize and I need to say you pick the time and the day next time and I'll be there because I owe that to you and if you don't want to do it anymore because of this I understand that too I apologize I don't want to waste your way sorry for wasting value your time and value your time and and he was no problem let's get it rescheduled and you know that's that's how most people respond to things but it is funny there are lots of times lots of people I've met we're saying I'm sorry is a hard thing they just either can't do it or they won't do it and I have yeah well they say pride go with before the fall or something yeah it's it's it's and you know too I want to talk about gratitude because you are somebody that I suspect has an intentional gratitude process um program if you run it you know yeah I can I can I can tell and I think our audience can tell that you seem to be a very grateful person despite having some pretty serious challenges um and let's talk about that what how do you practice gratitude absolutely so I'm a firm believer and when I lost my health that um sense of planning my everything that I had ever learned and cultivated in my life went out the window and of course with that came with a period of grieving like it I was not just oh I got Lyme disease which turned into every autoimmune disease but I'm still grateful like I definitely believe that there is a cycle of you know like you have to mourn you have to let yourself feel how much that sucks but you can't let yourself get stuck there yeah and I believe that one of the most critical things that I've learned over the last nine years of being of having to health challenges is having my toolkit for what is going to keep me in the right head space what are my go-tos for when I'm really not in a good head space or I'm having a really hard time physically um you know stress for instance makes my body flare up yeah and that's something we deal with every day so I have to be very intentional about what I'm feeding myself so to speak and that includes and I have a huge amount of what they call brain fog like I don't know if you've ever had a big meal and you just can't think and you're like ex-a-th- yeah well unfortunately Lyme disease attacks the brain and it causes swelling and I live in a sense a state of brain fog so for me having routines and having structure is absolutely pivotal for me so I've created like a toolkit of of course every night I actually do gratitude twice a day so usually you know usually you hear once a day but I've got very firm morning and nighttime routines that don't take a huge amount of time like anyone can implement routine into their life that is going to exponentially change their lives and for me this looks like first journaling out anything negative that happened during the day that I just need to get out you know I think that it's really important to come face to face with your challenges with your fears with your mistakes so anything that you need to get out get it out on paper but then take take everything negative that just happened and then write at least five gratitude right five things every day that you're grateful for that are not the same as the day before don't write the same things like things every day we have so much to be grateful for like like I said I am the luckiest sick person in the universe I have incredible access to medicine I have access to medicine I have health insurance they don't I mean they're useless but I still have it I have a supportive family a supportive real estate team and I have opportunities like this where where I can connect with others that are going through struggles to me that is something that I am grateful for every single day but there are a hundred million other things that I'm grateful for sure so making sure that I'm focusing on the good and not focusing on the fact that my hands feel like they're in a fire because of the nerve pain next I really really you know I I try every night I always say I'm gonna I've become a very big night out due to Lyme disease it's a lot it's a nocturnal bug which is very strange my entire life I was up at 5 a.m. to go to the gym before the mountain and and now I usually am like I can't sleep until 4 a.m. so what do I do at this time but I read I I take something and and usually it's you know something for self improvement like I'm reading atomic habits right now and I take that into every day it's how can I be one percent better and how can I take so much we you know our access to information right now is so incredible we are so lucky to be living right now just because I grew up you know I funny I grew up pre internet and internet the internet didn't even really become a thing browsers like around 94 or so and that's when I started college and you sort of had information access but even then it wasn't you know yeah right you were still heading to the library you were still looking at psycho pedias and I used to fantasize about just getting answers to things and now we are so lucky especially with things like chat cheaply it's not always accurate but but it's we can we can literally ask questions and it's like we have that Oracle at Delphi that you know we we would yeah so we're right so there's so much to learn yeah like how are you and you know one of my coaches says how are you every day is an opportunity that you might meet the person that changes your life and how do you want to show up how does the person that you want to be to meet that person how do they present themselves and show up every day so what do you need to do mentally physically to get yourself into the head space where you feel confident that if you met the person the you know the developer that was going to hire you to sell for the rest of your life with them that that could happen any day yeah what are you and you don't get to pick the day no you don't it can be a worst day ever but that's why it's so important to make sure that we have these practices in our lives and for me like you said I think it's amazing to sit in the car and be really intentional with with how with your thoughts and and kind of use that as a time for introspection for me I know that my car time is my time to catch up on podcasts on master classes on audio books like we spend so much time in our cars but this is actually a gift yeah it's learning it's a learning machine it's literally like you are just sitting in your car and you have the opportunity to learn just about anything you could ever dream of from the best of the best almost literally like and if you're not in a good mood and you're headed to a big meeting you know maybe that looks like pumping some rock and roll and just getting getting your game based on maybe it's like listening to add my let talk about something really positive or you know what is that tool for you that's going to get you in a head space because it's crazy if you pay attention to how quickly that pivot can happen from woe is me like I do not feel grateful for anything I just want to go to bed to okay I can do this and that is something to be grateful for is your routines the way that you're feeding yourself the way that you're you know maybe you have a go to person whether it's your spouse or a business partner a mentor and you're just you say I'm really struggling through this like can you help you know talk it out with me at least it doesn't have to be a solution but again this is all your toolkit that you we all need to be building and then the last thing I love doing affirmations in the present tense which is really goes along with writing out what my perfect client is but every night just writing out like I am healthy I am killing I'm strong I'm successful I'm powerful like you have to our brains are are so incredible in the way that they have the ability to to relearn muscle memory as what we'd call it and skiing but for muscles but your brain has neuroplasticity meaning if you get yourself into a state like for at night time I love to do binaural beats basically different frequencies yeah because it puts your brain in a state where it is able to become more like your your neural pathways will be open so what am I how am I feeding my brain positive messages how am I rewiring my limiting beliefs that we all have like we all have so much built up whether it's trauma from childhood or year whatever it may be that we might not even realize is there and I I'm really grateful to live in a generation in a time where we talk about this kind of thing we talk about you know I go to therapy EMBR every week and I swear this woman has completely changed the way that I am able to approach healing well let's I want to talk about EMDR for some sort of what that is is I movement desensitization desensitization yeah yeah something I'm like I don't know if I've ever met anyone the news that I've the sponsor so here and I'm going to overly simplify it and I'm going to make it and I don't I've never done it myself but I know essentially what it's attempt is to do it it works really well with trauma it works really well with PTSD things like that and here's why and you really ties into what you're talking about and and this doesn't sound real estate related for our listeners but it yeah it is because we you were saying about these these neural pathways they become thick for sort of highways in our brain and based on repetition and they just become our go-toes our brains were we're we're we're conditioned to respond in certain phrase we're behaviorists that this is you know we just do things we do things automatically and what happens is the things we learn when we were younger maybe some things weren't so helpful but we still learn them and they became you know stuck we get stuck in it and and what eat what I movement desensitization I believe does is it helps change break those neural pathways by by literally moving eyeballs around and doing some things but basically just singlets let's scratch the record that's running so it can't really play the same and then we're going to build some new pathways we're going to build some new records that are more intentional and and boy I you know it's yeah it's it's a it's a legitimate therapeutic technique it's it's been you know it's one of those things that doesn't sound like it should work but it does I don't understand still I'm like how did that just unlock this that allowed me to process whatever limiting belief that was so that we could create something new from it well I will I will tell everyone else too if you were looking to develop more skills around being able to manage your emotional state the best that I've ever found I've been studying this for now four or five years is dialectic behavior therapy yeah so everyone out there if you're struggling with emotional regulation distress tolerance interpersonal effectiveness things like this is what it's for it is all skills based it teaches you how to do things oh you're going to love it you are going to love it especially in this industry you look at it you know it I was looking at satz yesterday in Denver Metro just for instance 33 or 36% of agents did not renew their licenses in 2025 and I think we all know why it has been a very difficult couple of years people are burnt out we are burnt out I think that you know we keep looking for last year we're hoping for a new year and everything was going to get better and then nothing changed and this year it's like okay you know we don't really know what's going to come there might be a couple small decreases with the fed it seems like others are moving maybe and by the way just because that happens doesn't mean rates will change the last two months yeah exactly last two rate cuts yeah didn't affect a rates it all sat yeah usually they're inversely correlated looks like well okay so we have to we've really like using these difficult times in business and life to grow our skill set of resiliency of grit of how we approach life like it now is of the time and I think oftentimes when you're doing things like you know taking an hour a week to do therapy or hour and a half we think of oftentimes it's like why should we be working during that time but what we don't realize in what and I felt the same way and I I lived but I lived and died by my schedule of no I don't do that kind of state like this is my work day but what I didn't realize is that by doing those activities by making sure that you're getting your workout in by making sure that you're going to therapy or whatever it is for you that's helped cultivating the best parts parts of you and helping you grow as a human that is what is going to allow you to overflow into other people's lives to be to show up as your best self to have less bad days because you're learning the skills needed to be a successful human and we're all human at the end of the day you know whether you're looking at your idols on million dollar listing or something I don't know who's idols are but whatever it is like we look at these people and you think okay they must work 12 hours a day with absolutely no breaks and you can't you know you can't have self care in there but it's what you'd realize when you start implementing you know these must-do activities from your toolkit of okay I know that if I don't work out a certain number of days a week that I am not going to be as effective mentally, emotionally and I'm not going to you know I'll probably be a little bit more irritable so I know that if I'm not doing those things that I'm not going to be the best broker I can be for my clients so being intentional with our time and recognizing that whatever self care and I think self-care kind of has gotten this connotation with it of like going to the spot. Not being luxurious. Yeah, you know maybe every once in a while you're celebrating a big win and you should go celebrate and go to the four seasons spot or something but no we're talking about the basics every day every week that we need to become just as non-negotiable as the green time time blocked into your calendar for real estate because that's sharpening your brain. Yeah well look physical exercise unfortunately is a non-negotiable if we want to have the energy to do extraordinary things even just to do normal things you need it and we know what I've learned too and I'm curious to get your thoughts athletes always know this that you don't have to like something you just have to do it. You just have to show up. Yeah, you back there's a lot of things I don't like to do if I can just get myself to do them then it doesn't like I kept waiting for me to like love doing pull-ups or actually I don't mind doing pulse but doing burpees do it well burpees yeah perfect I will I will never enjoy doing burpees but it's a really good idea to do a burpee it's a really good idea the the data is in it's so I can say well I don't like to do that and then well okay good that's fine I don't like to pay my taxes I don't like to do a lot of things in life. I don't think it's hard right but and it's it's hard and it hurts and it's painful and all of that is true and I just still have to I still get to do it and if I just do it I'll feel proud I'll probably be I'll feel so I'll be more proud of myself for doing the thing I don't want to do then the thing I do want to do right so it's even it's even it's funny you actually I actually get a bigger benefit from doing the thing that I dislike the most but that is really super healthy for me so I used to say to myself like I really should like start doing cardio because I was doing weights and I still do weights and I kept saying I really should I kept waiting for that motivation to kick in it's like oh that's not how it works like I just have to do it I just have to do it and then I'm not gonna like it probably okay fine but it's a really good idea and just and just do it and then I will be like oh my god DJ you did something you didn't even want to do so so I honestly that's how I live every day I mean I I used to spring out of bed in the morning now getting out of bed is literally the most painful difficult experience ever so I have to I litter I have like okay I'm gonna get my podcast on that's gonna motivate me to like drag myself out of bed and then I'm gonna take a shower and it's gonna be so hard because I'm exhausted but it's like celebrating those small victories and then when you start can like when you continue showing up for yourself when you don't want to it creates a sense of self like accomplishment and you can feel proud of yourself for saying you know I did not you know I didn't think I was capable of showing up today I didn't think that you know I I could have let a million things get in the way of that workout but when you're finished doing it not only do you have that sense of accomplishment but you've also you're building again those resiliency you're building a neural pathway that shows you you can do hard things you can accomplish anything you want but it's not fun so don't anyone that thinks that you know all of this is is sunshine and rainbows it's like no a good majority of being an adult is difficult and and but if you recognize how you feel before and after you do something you know my first mentor always said the heavy light test if you and I think this goes well with real estate is there are so many avenues to success and if you try and do everything it's a not gonna be authentic to you but be you're not gonna have fun like it's and if you're not finding the activities in your life they make you feel lighter when you're done they make you feel heavier they need to be rid of the heavy and it's a really easy way to determine you know where you should focus your energy especially like in real estate if you're someone that hates making cold calls and you feel heavy and down afterward you probably should not put that on you know that probably shouldn't be your focus of your day and the good news is there's a million other avenues yeah you don't you know it's there are some sales jobs where you have to make cold calls and that's that's a tough position to be and maybe you should find another job if you if you hate it that much but good news about real estate is you okay you don't want to do cold calls great there's seven other things you can try that you might enjoy and if you're authentic to it I really believe that's where you find success and and the easiest way for me in life to understand you know whether it's spending time with certain people doing certain activities do I feel lighter or do I feel heavier and you can apply that to anything in life and it will really help guide you in making decisions on where your time should be spent because it'll help you show up as your most authentic light self I love that I've never heard of that heavy light test I'm going to start applying that to my partner it's one of the best things I ever heard and I want to talk I want to wrap up with one thing because you've given a so much of your time I want to wrap up in being coached let's talk about the importance you were professional athlete every professional athlete I've ever met has a coach now you're a real estate agent you're a top real estate agent do you still have a coach oh yeah I have two were at the moment usually I have two a business coach and a real estate coach and I mean then that doesn't even get into like the therapy coaching or whatever sure but no I'm I'm a firm believer that no matter what industry I mean for the most part in life there should be someone looking from a bird's eye view over your business and helping you determine like understand where your blind spots are helping you understand where your time is going and what your natural talents are and how to cultivate them but also keeping you accountable I mean I've been with a coaching program I was with a coaching program for six years and they helped create basically a grid of activities that I needed to get done every week and you know it would be like five face to face meals 10 break 10 face to like zooms or coffee breaks a bunch of phone calls open houses and handwritten notes newsletter and then I started putting in like gym you know I started putting in the my non-negotiables for health as well but if I would turn this in at the end of the week and there were blank spots it meant that I was donating $10 to charity per blank but I did not fill in that week so it created accountability it but they also you know we don't know what we don't know and especially as a you know a former athlete I've always had that like get it done yourself mentality and what coaching has taught me is that we are not meant to do everything ourselves we're meant to find what what our purpose is what we're really good at hone those skills see where we can improve our other skills that you know are are things that we need to do in order to be successful but not necessarily our green time and then also recognizing what your weaknesses are and learning how to delegate and learning how to work with a team because we really don't understand our blind spots when we're running from one thing to the next thing to the next thing and you don't have that time to be really reflecting and intentional so for me coaching is by far the most valuable gift you can give yourself it's expensive yes will it pay for itself tenfold absolutely if you find but also recognizing that there are so many different types of coaching like different type I guess just different types of coaching and you need to really do your research go to conferences talk to different coaches you know on zooms really interview them as well to find who you feel you align with from not only a real estate standpoint but from how they live their lives because you want to be learning from someone who you admire in all aspects of life not someone who's selling you know 300 homes a year but is divorced because they were never home lost custody of their kids you know sleeps under the desk like that is not the person probably that you want to be learning from and less unless that's how you want to end up sure understanding that you're you know we we all need accountability and we all need someone that's not afraid to give it to us straight and that's what coaches are there for yeah I love it well I think that is a perfect place for us to wrap up this episode I would love to continue talking with you and I'm definitely going to have you back because you have a lot of wisdom and you've given a lot of your own personal processes to our audience I hope our audience can take some of those and apply them to their own life this is this is you know we're not in practice this is the real the real world and we get to make decisions and we get to to to architect our own life but it requires some intentionality and it's time to slow down you know I suspect you probably don't spend a ton of time scrolling on social media maybe you do but we all have ways in which we you know we we you know probably should spend our time more effectively I certainly fall into I mean I waste time in lots of ways but this is where coaching comes in and this is where having other people in our life we don't have to do it all ourselves and in fact we can't and so this idea of having a community you've got a community of coaches you know you talked about you have health coaches you have business coaches you have you know I bet you have coaches for every part I call my team my coaches too me too yeah also I love it I always I always tell people this that I have somebody that wakes me up every morning at 6 a.m she calls me and it sounds I don't know how it sounds yeah well and the reason I do it is it's it's not easy for me to do that and and I've become better at it but I know I won't let somebody else down I'll let myself down easily but I won't let somebody else down so now I wake up five minutes before she calls me and I message her and that makes me feel yeah it just makes me feel proud now yeah but again it's systems like you have systems but you need other people to help you with your system sometimes and it's there's no shame in that I used to be kind of embarrassed like I have up 48 I still have to have somebody wake me up but I used to have someone have to come to my house and physically wake me up because my body just wanted to sleep 24 hours a day I hope to have people come wake me up in the morning at my house and I'm like that you know that's humbling I do what you gotta do sometimes yeah yeah and and and this idea too is this we can rely upon others yeah and others and some people will let us down and some people won't be there for the entire journey of our lives but some people will and some people will come and go but boy isn't it great that you can that you can allow yourself to fall apart a little bit here and there and let other people prop you up so you can fall apart it's it's beautiful yeah yeah that really is the heart of authenticity and and being vulnerable and you know we're in an industry that's very one person dominant and if we can build community it's the greatest gift we can give ourselves love it well Athena Brownson is our guest today she won't want everybody to follow her on Instagram Athena Brownson Reelter we will have a link to that it's Brownson BRO WN so Athena thank you so much you are an inspiration to all of us and you are a great reminder to us about obviously get to work but be intentional and take care of yourself and build in hard things to do because that's how we do it that next level and pivot pivot that's you know it's funny I'll give you one quick pivot story as I'm gonna next thing this just happened to me a couple weeks ago I woke up and I was feeling really blue it just happened I I couldn't even I couldn't even tell you why but but it was it was there just happened and I was like really a little bit depressed and sad and I and it was funny is I looked out at my my windows in my condo and I saw the sun shining and I go that's well that's something to be grateful for but then I thought but is that enough for me to like overcome this blue because I wanted to on but I wasn't feeling well but I also wanted to pivot and so I said okay well what would I need to think in order to feel differently right now and I said well there's a lot of people that didn't wake up today there's a lot of people that yesterday was their last day on this earth I got another day like some the universe god whoever somebody gave me another day and at the very least that's an opportunity and I go well that's pretty cool and so I just yeah sometimes that's all it needs to be right it's like hey um you know everything in my life is falling apart but I'm still here for in this moment everything's I'm still fighting yeah and and so sometimes I just love gratitude is the fastest way I know to pivot um so yeah well we're all in on many things my friend well we are fast friends and I appreciate you being on the show Kidred Spirits for sure and I appreciate you and and look because of this
