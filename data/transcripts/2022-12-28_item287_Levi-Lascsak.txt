[00:02:28] Alright, enough from me. Let's get to the main event. My conversation with Levi Lassick.
[00:02:46] Today on the show, we have Levi Lassick who released his first YouTube video on December 5th, 2020 as a...
[00:02:57] I really want you guys to listen to this biography because what I'm about to tell you is going to sound almost impossible.
[00:03:03] So I'm going to start this over. If anyone was just possibly listening, I want you to actively listen for about the next 20 seconds.
[00:03:11] So Levi Lassick released his first YouTube video on December 5th, 2020 as a brand new real estate agent.
[00:03:18] And he had not sold a home in 2020 or the first quarter of 2021. So again, he started his first YouTube video in December of 2020.
[00:03:28] He hadn't sold a home that entire year and the first quarter of 2021 also, no home sold.
[00:03:33] Levi partnered with Travis Plum and they closed their first two transactions from the YouTube channel.
[00:03:39] In other words, leads they received from their video in April of 2021.
[00:03:44] Now that's the second quarter of 2021. Over... Now here's the incredible part.
[00:03:50] Over the next year, they generated 164 transactions, which equaled 90 million in production.
[00:03:58] And this just makes me cry because I want... I wish this was not my story and not Levi's.
[00:04:05] 2.7 million in commissions with... And this is the really incredible part even with all of that being said, zero ad spend.
[00:04:15] So they now own the fastest growing and most viewed real estate YouTube channel in Dallas, Texas.
[00:04:22] And they generate no joke, three to five qualified inbound leads every single day.
[00:04:29] Now you guys got to check this out. I want you to do two things. I want you to go first to get hooked on
[00:04:35] Levi's content because he has amazing content for you, the agent, which is passive prospecting.com.
[00:04:41] He's got a book. We're going to talk about that. And he really wants you to take a look at it.
[00:04:45] And also, I want you to watch what he's doing on YouTube, which is also passive prospecting search for that channel.
[00:04:51] We will have links to both those... We'll have both those links in the show notes. Levi, welcome to the show.
[00:04:58] Thanks for having me. Appreciate it.
[00:05:00] I don't know that I... I don't know that I... in the 430 episodes or whatever we've done.
[00:05:04] I don't think I've ever interrupted myself in the middle of a reading someone's bio, but I was like,
[00:05:08] no, I have to make a big deal about this because you're not the first person we've had on the show
[00:05:14] that has really built a solid hyper local brand on YouTube.
[00:05:19] But you're the one who's had probably the most success so quickly.
[00:05:24] And it's just... I am like tongue tied. I'm not sure exactly what to even ask you because this is
[00:05:31] even blowing me away. But let's get... Let's start at the very beginning of the story before we get into
[00:05:36] sort of how you did all this. How and why did you get into real estate?
[00:05:43] Reluctantly. That's why I've got a friend, Michael Rees. Do you know Michael? You ever met Michael Rees?
[00:05:49] I don't think so.
[00:05:50] Okay. Well, I've known him for 20 years and he got licensed in 2002. And we actually sold gym
[00:05:57] memberships together, Bali Total Fitness. So he... That's a rough job by the way.
[00:06:02] Oh, hey, we worked 12 hours a day, seven days a week. And that was literally... So that's... And I did
[00:06:08] that one hour. I was like 20, 21 years old. So I just got out of military and I needed a job.
[00:06:15] And that's the thing is is Michael. First of all, he sold me the most expensive membership there
[00:06:20] on a three-year contract, which I couldn't afford at all whatsoever. And then he eventually just
[00:06:26] recruited me because I had this $8 an hour job. And that was it. I was doing labor work and I lost
[00:06:35] that job. And then he recruited me, which was great because I couldn't pay for my gym membership.
[00:06:39] I think I went up there to tell him I needed to cancel it somehow and get me out of my three-year
[00:06:43] contract and blah, blah, blah. And he's like, well, just come work for me. And I was like, okay,
[00:06:47] cool. And then I started working 12 hours a day, seven days a week, making phone calls.
[00:06:52] Literally, we would phone call 10 hours a day. Yeah, to try to get five appointments the next day.
[00:06:59] That was the whole goal. You were not allowed to stop calling until you had five appointments
[00:07:04] the next day. And if you got your five appointments next day, they're like, well, go ahead and start
[00:07:08] on the day after. So anyways, just call for 10 hours straight because we would start at 10 a.m.
[00:07:15] The ship was literally 10 a.m. to 10 p.m. But we couldn't call after 8 p.m. So we had a 10-hour
[00:07:22] window that we had to call and literally get in there at 10 a.m. and would start just hammering
[00:07:27] the smile in and dialing. Yeah. And then the whole goal was, of course, it was to have five people
[00:07:33] in the gym to tour them around to sell possibly two or three memberships a day. So it was it was
[00:07:39] brutal. But I didn't care. The thing was is that Michael was a sales machine and you know,
[00:07:46] and I just looked up to him and was like, a lot, if he can do it, I got to do better than him.
[00:07:50] That's all I've ever said. I have a very simple formula for success, which is who's at the top?
[00:07:55] How did they get there? You know, can I model that? Can I adjust it to fit my personality? And then
[00:08:01] can I do better than them? Very simple. And that's what I learned from the very beginning was Michael's
[00:08:06] like, well, look, here's what I'm doing. I'm making all these phone calls. Here's what you can do.
[00:08:11] Actually, they gave me the old lead book. They gave me the binder of all the old leads that
[00:08:16] everybody had already called 500 times and didn't want to call anymore. And so I just started calling
[00:08:21] them. And then what happened was, is within three weeks, I became the top salesperson there.
[00:08:26] And started even beat Michael. And I just figured out a better way to do it. And more creative ways.
[00:08:32] And then Michael took me to my first Brian Tracy. It was my first time I've been exposed to personal
[00:08:40] education, you know, or self-education. And he was like, hey, I'm going to see this guy. Brian
[00:08:46] Tracy talked. I was like, okay, cool. Didn't know who it was or it wasn't even thinking about that
[00:08:50] sort of thing. And Brian Tracy, toward the country, spoke for free, put on free events, of course,
[00:08:57] to sell all of his courses and CDs and everything at the back of the room. And I remember I just
[00:09:02] had a $300 credit card. It was my first credit card. I had a $300 limit. And it was supposed to be
[00:09:08] for emergencies. And that day I saw Brian Tracy speak. And I went to the back of the room and I bought
[00:09:14] as many programs as I could and maxed out that $300 credit card. And I remember I bought,
[00:09:19] I believe, six different programs. So I bought like the psychology of selling, the psychology of
[00:09:25] mindset. You know, I don't know. He just had all these programs and they were CDs. So they were
[00:09:29] the books with like six CDs. And yeah. And the cool thing was is I had this really crappy,
[00:09:36] that was really crappy, but it was a Volkswagen Jetta. But the one thing it had was a six CD
[00:09:41] changer. So I could put all six CDs in my six CD changer, which was in the trunk, by the way.
[00:09:49] They'll put the trunk and put it in there. And I would listen to the psychology of selling,
[00:09:54] you know, driving back and forth to the gym. And anywhere I went, I'd never listen to music really
[00:10:01] in my 20s, I believe. Everybody would ask me about the new bands and what did I like? And I'd be like,
[00:10:06] I don't know. I don't know who you're talking about really. Because I just, I just bought into that
[00:10:13] from the beginning. And I just, it just changed my perspective. And I just started consuming as
[00:10:17] much as possible. Now the thing was is I was in the reserves still. And in 2002, I remember the
[00:10:25] day Michael came back from meeting a guy named Jay Kinder at the lake. And he came back on Taballi's
[00:10:32] on Monday. I was like, I'm getting into real estate. You know, he's like, that screw this. And so,
[00:10:36] he's like, I'm getting into real estate. I was like, okay, cool. All right. Good luck. You know,
[00:10:40] and he's like, no, you got to come with me. Well, he got licensed 2002 finally talked me into it
[00:10:45] in 2004. So I did get licensed in 2004. But what happened was as soon as I completed my training,
[00:10:53] I had my license for I think about a week. And I got called up because I was still in the reserves.
[00:10:59] And they gave, you know, I got a call from the military and said, you're being reactivated.
[00:11:02] You're about to deploy and you're going to be gone for 18 months. And so, and so that was it. So I
[00:11:08] I literally and they gave me I think four days is like a four day notice.
[00:11:13] You know, and this was this was a 2004. So this was right in the height of, you know, I rack and
[00:11:20] Afghanistan. And so literally I remember getting that phone call. And they said, you've got four days
[00:11:26] to report to Fort Hood, you know, in Texas. And when that was it. So four days to say goodbye,
[00:11:32] pack my bags, you know, and that was it. And so I never, I never practiced real estate. I never
[00:11:39] did it. And the thing was as I was gone for 18 months and ended up spending a year of that over
[00:11:45] in Iraq. And whenever I got home in 2006, then I knew over that time frame, what I over I knew I
[00:11:55] didn't want to be a real estate agent. I realized, you know, being gone for 18 months, Michael just
[00:11:59] talked me into it. I really didn't want to be a real estate agent in the beginning. I got licensed
[00:12:03] just because he told me to. And then when I got deployed, I thought, maybe this is divine intervention.
[00:12:08] So whenever I came back, I didn't even, you know, the license expired. I didn't renew it. And I
[00:12:14] didn't become an agent. And so I went, I went on my own path from there. Now Michael and I have
[00:12:18] stayed friends over the last 20 years, watched each other grow and, you know, succeed and dip and all,
[00:12:25] you know, all this kind of thing. But, but yeah, it was really 2020. When my, my financial services
[00:12:31] business, I had contracts with Dallas, I was the, I worked with all the teachers on their retirement
[00:12:36] planning. And I've been doing that for the last five years. Very lucrative, very successful at that.
[00:12:42] And then, you know, April of 2020, all the school shut down. And whenever all the school shut down,
[00:12:47] everything I built up over five years, it just kind of was gone overnight. And you know, I'm sitting
[00:12:53] there at 41 years old, asking myself, okay, well, what just happened? How did I end up in this
[00:13:00] position? And how do I start over without starting over? So, you know, it was, it was an interesting time
[00:13:06] because I was sitting there thinking, all right, this when school going to come back, when's the
[00:13:12] world going to reopen? I mean, what's going to happen? Nobody knew, right? And so I couldn't meet with
[00:13:17] people. I used to meet with all the teachers on campus, of course, all the schools were shut down.
[00:13:22] None of the teachers knew how to work zoom. So nobody was trying to invest. They were all calling
[00:13:27] me to pull out money from their retirement. Sure. Sure. And I was just thinking, all right, well,
[00:13:33] what am I going to do now? And here comes Michael. Okay, now's the best time to get in a real estate.
[00:13:39] And I was like, bro, I don't want to be a real estate agent, you know? And he's like, but I'm
[00:13:44] telling you, man, and the thing is with Michael, Michael has always seen the potential and everybody
[00:13:50] that he, and he knows how to also pull that out of people as well. And I think, you know,
[00:13:55] Michael just knows me as a person in general, ever since we sold gym memberships, we spent a lot
[00:14:00] of time together and watching each other over the years. He knows who I am. He knows my work ethic.
[00:14:06] He knows what I'm capable of. And I think that's why he just never gave up on trying to get me in
[00:14:11] the business and always wanted to work with me again. As I always wanted to work with him, but I
[00:14:17] just never wanted to be the real estate agent. So I said, well, as long as you're an agent, I'm probably,
[00:14:21] we're probably not going to work together. Just because I had no desire to do that. I was interested
[00:14:27] in investing. I like investing and I flipped a few properties here and there. I've had rentals,
[00:14:32] you know, so I've done transactions. And I enjoyed that part of it, but I was a part time, you know,
[00:14:39] I was a part time investor. So I did one or two fixed reflips a year. I did have seven rentals
[00:14:44] at one time. So, but I always worked with an agent. So even during that time, I never
[00:14:49] renewed my license because I just again, to me, it wasn't worth it to try to make a little extra
[00:14:55] commission. I'd rather just work with somebody that could handle that, build it into the price and
[00:14:59] just be done with it. Sure. So that was it. So over 2020, he was, he was like, hey man, now's the
[00:15:05] best time to get in the real estate. And as I looked at everything over the summer of 2020,
[00:15:11] every industry was going down the tank, except for real estate. It was probably one of the only
[00:15:16] industries other than online shopping that started to increase during 2020. Sure.
[00:15:22] And so I thought, well, you know, if I'm going to make them move, maybe this is the time to do it.
[00:15:28] However, I was, I was literally scared to death, you know, because I was, first of all, I'm 41 years
[00:15:34] old at that time. And I'm 43 now, but I was 41 going, okay, how do you, again, how do you start over
[00:15:41] without starting over? I mean, how do I, how do I get into a new industry, a new business? And
[00:15:46] is there a way to jumpstart that is how am I, how am I going to compete with every agent in Dallas
[00:15:52] that's been in the business for five, 10, 15, 30 years when one of the most competitive markets?
[00:15:59] How am I going to position myself? Am I going to have to go out there and shake hands and kiss babies
[00:16:03] and, you know, go to all these neighborhood events and start, and I was, that I was just not really
[00:16:09] interested in either, you know, nothing wrong with that at all. But I was just thinking, I'm at
[00:16:14] a different point in my life, you know, I love the movie, The Boiler Room, but I'm just not into all
[00:16:18] the phone calls anymore. You already, you already did your time on the phone. Yeah, yeah. I mean, I,
[00:16:24] I can do it. I just didn't want to do it. And I was just thinking, okay, well, one thing that
[00:16:29] Michael said to me that always resonated was, and I, and I heard him speak, you know, to other groups
[00:16:34] and do trainings. And, you know, one thing he said that always stood out to me was, he said, he
[00:16:38] said, it's not the best real estate agent that wins. It's the best marketer. And so as I thought
[00:16:43] about that more, I was just thinking, well, if I'm moving to real estate, instead of getting into
[00:16:47] real estate and then trying to figure out a plan, I just thought, let me figure out a plan. And if I
[00:16:52] can figure out a plan, maybe I'll get into real estate, if I can see a viable option for myself.
[00:16:58] And if it, and if the best marketer wins, then I need a good marketing plan. And I need to find a
[00:17:03] way to attract business. And how can I bring people to me versus me having to go out there,
[00:17:09] pound the pavement, shake hands, kiss babies, try to build a brand from scratch to be known and
[00:17:15] compete with every Joe Bob and Susie out there selling real estate. Is there a gap too? I was like,
[00:17:21] is there a gap in the market? Is there an actual gap in Dallas real estate that I could slip into
[00:17:26] somehow and attract business and bring people to me so that the traffic is inbound? Well,
[00:17:35] there's only really, I think, the way to do that this day and age quickly is through social media.
[00:17:40] And so I knew that. And so I was like, okay, it's likely going to be social media because I also
[00:17:45] knew I didn't want to start a postcard campaign. And I didn't want to start a magazine and a billboard
[00:17:50] and start spending a ton of money, especially in the middle of a pandemic where who knows what was
[00:17:55] going to happen anyways. And even going out and meeting people or events, all that stuff was
[00:18:01] still very questionable even for Texas. I mean, I'm in Dallas, Texas and we were open faster than
[00:18:07] anybody other than Florida. So, but still people were still a little on the fence about events and
[00:18:13] things like that. So, so I was just thinking, okay, social media, all right. Well, so I started
[00:18:19] looking at people, you know, agents that that Michael knew and everyone was like, okay,
[00:18:25] Instagram, TikTok, Facebook, especially TikTok. I mean, every agent that seemed like in 2020
[00:18:30] woke up with 10,000 TikTok followers. You know, and so everyone was going, you got to be on TikTok,
[00:18:36] right? TikTok where it's at. And I'm like, well, how much business did you get from that? Well,
[00:18:39] you know, I get a lot of inquiries. A lot of people say, hey, I'm interested, you know, but I didn't,
[00:18:47] I didn't hear a lot of people turning over business. And I didn't really hear people, I know people
[00:18:51] are successful on these platforms. Nothing to take away from them either. I just didn't hear anybody
[00:18:56] like driving primary business. Like I didn't hear people saying, man, I've done a hundred deals
[00:19:02] from Instagram. I've done 50 deals from Facebook. I've done 75 deals from TikTok. I just wasn't hearing
[00:19:09] that. I know people generate business, but it was more like supplementing their their primary
[00:19:15] business. A lot of agents that have been in the business for five, 10 or 15 years. And so they have
[00:19:20] marketing plans. They have a sphere of influence. They have referrals coming in. So the social media,
[00:19:26] yeah, they do in 10, 20, 30 deals, but not where I really wanted to be. And over my, you know, career,
[00:19:35] I've been in three major industries. And I've always been successful from the start. Because again,
[00:19:41] I followed my simple model success, which was who's at the top? How did they get there? What are they
[00:19:46] doing? Can I model it? Can I adjust it to fit my personality? And can I do better than them? And so
[00:19:51] every time I did something else or made a transition, that's what I did. And so I thought, well, who can I,
[00:19:57] who can I do that in, in real estate? You know, but I didn't really want to be on TikTok or Instagram
[00:20:03] or Facebook either. I have not really been on social media that much because I'm at, I was at that
[00:20:09] 41 year old age range. And if you're like me and you're at that 40 age range and above, you probably
[00:20:14] have a love hate relationship with social media. I am, I am with you. And yes.
[00:20:19] Yeah. So, you know, we didn't grow up with it. It wasn't there in high school. It wasn't there
[00:20:23] in college. Came around in our late 20s, early 30s. We felt like it's just people bragging, posting
[00:20:30] cat videos and talking about their lunch. And here's my, yeah, it was my dinner. Yeah. And we're
[00:20:35] like, okay, that's stupid. But then, but then we started to see the 20 and 30 year olds make some
[00:20:40] money and we're going, okay, well, maybe there's something to this social media thing. But then,
[00:20:44] you know, nobody ever really digs into it. And so I knew going in, I was like, well, I also knew I
[00:20:51] wanted to pick one platform because the last thing I wanted to do was do what everybody was telling
[00:20:56] me to do is, well, you got to be on five different platforms. Well, I just think if you start out
[00:21:01] that way, you're going to put a 20% effort into five different platforms and you'll never truly
[00:21:05] master one and you'll never truly generate business from any of them because you're dabbling in
[00:21:10] all of them. And they're also different. Yeah. Extremely different. And so I thought, well, I want to
[00:21:16] choose one platform because I want to go all in on one platform. I want to focus on that platform.
[00:21:21] And then if I can build some business or something from that platform, it'll be much easier to branch
[00:21:27] out to the other ones than it is to try to cover all five at once. So I just started doing research
[00:21:33] and started looking into, you know, Facebook Instagram and TikTok first because that's what everybody
[00:21:37] told me to do. And when I studied that more and got deeper in those rabbit holes, I realized I
[00:21:44] really don't like those platforms for me. Nothing I was really interested in. I didn't see
[00:21:51] anything there as far as a path that fit my personality. So I started to, so then I started to think,
[00:21:59] well, I don't know, YouTube, actually what I did was I stopped and I started to look at
[00:22:04] people at our brokerage. Like you mentioned, go go, Michael Reese, there's another guy named Kyle
[00:22:10] Handy, Ricky Karuth, a couple of these people I started looking at and they were some of the
[00:22:15] top agents in an eXp. And so what I looked at them, I started to say, what's their commonality?
[00:22:23] And what I what I saw was, well, they've got a pretty strong YouTube presence, you know,
[00:22:29] not really in building a real estate business, but they had a YouTube business, you know,
[00:22:34] are they a YouTube, they're talking to other agents, attracting agents, things like that. So I thought,
[00:22:39] well, and what did I do? I looked at all their YouTube channels and they were talking about their time
[00:22:44] in production, right? You know, Ricky's known for like being one of the best cold callers, you know,
[00:22:49] Kyle's known for being really good at SEO and blog writing and doing open houses and go go has her,
[00:22:56] you know, social media boot camp and then, you know, Michael does his, you know, different funnels,
[00:23:02] you know, so, but they talked about their business, how they generated that and they're doing it on
[00:23:07] YouTube. And so I thought, well, that's kind of interesting. What if I just did that for real estate
[00:23:12] clients, you know, um, started to find out and I started to do research on YouTube and what I
[00:23:17] soon found out was that YouTube is a search engine, not a social media platform. Right. In fact,
[00:23:21] I think it's the number two search engine online, I believe at least in this country. Yeah.
[00:23:27] Yeah, it's number two behind Google. So I started to see that that YouTube was a search engine,
[00:23:33] and whenever I realized, oh, it's a search engine. And wondered if people are searching,
[00:23:39] you know, suburbs of Dallas. And so I started to look at, okay, Plano, Texas, for example,
[00:23:44] went on to Google on Google, Plano gets about 90,500 searches per month, not bad at all.
[00:23:50] But whenever you find that search volume on YouTube, it's 834,000 searches per month. It's 10
[00:23:55] times search volume on YouTube than it is on Google. So that immediately told me that while people
[00:24:01] are searching 10 times the amount on YouTube over Google, they want to see these places. And then
[00:24:07] it made me realize, well, you know what? I think the reason those other platforms didn't resonate
[00:24:13] with me is because what I saw was a bunch of seasoned agents that have been in the business 5, 10,
[00:24:18] 15 years telling their telling stories about their experiences and their clients and how to do this
[00:24:25] on a home and how to watch out for this and look out for this and look out for that. And I hadn't
[00:24:29] even sold a home yet. So I was thinking, okay, well, I could, I could read about a VA loan and then
[00:24:35] regurgitate that on 60 second video on TikTok. But it just didn't seem authentic to me. It didn't
[00:24:42] seem right. It didn't really, I just thought, and I don't want to be that guy. Start edge. Yeah,
[00:24:47] it doesn't provide any particularly new value. It's not a terrible idea. But maybe there's a better
[00:24:55] idea, which is what you're headed to. Yeah. So yeah. So just as I dug into YouTube a little bit
[00:25:01] more than what I realized was, okay, well, if people are searching information about, you know,
[00:25:07] Dallas, Texas and Plano, Texas and Frisco, Texas and all the suburbs, well, I know everything about
[00:25:14] Dallas or mostly everything about Dallas. Maybe I can just talk about Dallas, not even have to talk
[00:25:19] about real estate in general or talk about contracts and escrow and title and the different types of
[00:25:25] loans. What if I just talk about the suburbs? And so that's where I started to really dig in
[00:25:31] and build out a plan. I built out a business plan. And this is something I think nobody does
[00:25:36] whenever they start on social platforms is treating YouTube like a business. And what I love
[00:25:43] to say now is that if you treat YouTube like a hobby, it'll pay you like a hobby. And if you treat
[00:25:47] YouTube like a business, it'll pay you like a business. And so what I did was I just started to
[00:25:52] research every possible thing I could on YouTube and YouTube marketing and videos and how to make
[00:25:59] videos and then, you know, look at all these different real estate channels. And then I just started
[00:26:04] to build out a plan of what I thought may do well as far as what people are searching. And then
[00:26:09] I had the search volume that helped me as well. So it wasn't me just guessing on, oh, maybe should
[00:26:14] I make this video? It was no. I could actually go in and see what were people searching on.
[00:26:19] Yeah, you know, you know, you know your potential audience size before you ever start recording
[00:26:24] because you have an idea of what that search volume traffic could be. And then of course,
[00:26:31] you have people you're competing within that space too, which you also, I imagine, did research on.
[00:26:36] Yep. Well, the thing was there wasn't really a lot in Dallas surprisingly. And that's the thing is
[00:26:41] is whenever I talk about, yeah, looking for a gap, there was, there was about five agents maybe,
[00:26:47] five agents that I found in Dallas that were mostly consistent. And one of them, the top channel
[00:26:54] had 7,000 subscribers. The second to top had 5,000 subscribers. Oh. And the next one had four,
[00:27:02] and the next one had three. Right. I was starting at zero. And I thought, okay, well,
[00:27:07] the top one has 7,000. So that's the, that's my person, right? That's the goal. That's the benchmark.
[00:27:12] Yeah. But yeah, we passed everybody up about six months ago. So
[00:27:17] and we should let people know sort of when we're talking about, you know, doing research,
[00:27:22] I'm going to throw a few ideas you tell me if these are, you know, worthy. And again,
[00:27:28] you're basing these based on search volume. So you're taking a look, you're doing the research.
[00:27:32] And so we're saying, okay, what kind of content are we talking about? So let's say somebody's
[00:27:36] moving to Plano. You could do a video on if there's enough traffic, best schools in Plano,
[00:27:42] or reasons to move to Plano, or here's the nightlife in Plano, or here's the, here are the
[00:27:47] neighborhoods that, you know, are most whatever, you know, it could be anything. Here's, here's
[00:27:53] the best restaurants in what Plano, or it could be top 10 reasons to move. Or so I'm just throwing
[00:27:58] these out there. Are this, is this the kind of content that we're talking about? Yeah, all of those
[00:28:03] would not even real estate necessarily related, but just related to people wanting information
[00:28:08] about living in Plano. Yeah, they want to see it. I mean, anybody can go on Plano or go on an
[00:28:15] iBire platform and look at homes all day in Plano, but. Zillow doesn't weigh better than we'll ever do it,
[00:28:21] right? Yeah, but they, uh, Basilow doesn't show them the home across the street, the homeless,
[00:28:25] or the playground, the community center, the community pool, the HOA pool, you know, it doesn't show
[00:28:32] them that you put lay around the corner doesn't show you that stuff. So yeah, we can, we actually
[00:28:36] take them out neighborhoods and show them that. Uh, yeah, pros and cons video, people want to know
[00:28:40] what's the good and the bad of living in an area, pros video, you can talk about all the good things
[00:28:44] in your area, you can talk about all the bad things are actually our number one video is, you know,
[00:28:49] what we hate about Dallas. That's funny. Uh, you know, it's funny. I was thinking about this as you
[00:28:57] were talking, I apologized and are up you. And first, by the way, before I meant to say this about
[00:29:01] 20 minutes ago and I, and I escaped me, but thank you, of course, for your service because without
[00:29:05] the safety of, uh, of our citizens, um, you know, we, we can't do much of anything. And so I,
[00:29:13] I just, you know, you said it that very quickly and I just want to, you know, force pause and admire
[00:29:18] you for, for dedicating service to, uh, to our country to help all of us, um, stay safe. And so
[00:29:24] thank you for that. Um, and I also, uh, wanted to, to, you know, I was just thinking about this. I was
[00:29:31] in, uh, I went on a father's son trip to Ireland with my dad, I three or four years ago and my
[00:29:37] dad had already been a couple of times. And so he was pretty familiar with a lot of the, the,
[00:29:41] the little towns and, uh, and all the sites. But, um, we were trying a few cities that he had never
[00:29:46] been to. It was my first time there. And so we're driving across, you know, all over the country,
[00:29:50] which is what everyone does when they go to Ireland. And every single night, because we visit about
[00:29:55] two to three cities a day, the very, for, you're, you're so absolutely right about this because the,
[00:30:00] yes, I had the, you know, Rick Steves, uh, travel Ireland book that was in our car. Um, but we were
[00:30:06] driving a lot. And my dad doesn't like to read the car. I was driving and it's everything's
[00:30:10] backwards. So it takes a lot of concentration. I can't certainly look up things in the book while I'm
[00:30:15] driving stick shift, you know, these little tiny roads in Ireland, hoping I don't get killed, um,
[00:30:19] because I'm driving the wrong way. But what we would do the night before is we would literally
[00:30:24] just go to YouTube and say best things to do in X. And then what we would do is we would download
[00:30:30] the video and then we would play it in the car, you know, that next day on the way to those places.
[00:30:35] And that was the best possible education I got because you're right. The books are great. And they
[00:30:39] were helpful. Um, but they didn't really give me a sense of what it was like to go to some of these
[00:30:46] attractions in these events. Um, so we would download it and watch it or listen to it on the way, uh,
[00:30:51] to that place. And, and I think a lot of people do this when they go visit places they have it. They
[00:30:55] look go best things to do, right? And, um, so I mean, that in and of itself is a is, is kind of the
[00:31:01] blueprint for for what we're talking about is find things that people are already searching for and
[00:31:06] just create the best possible video for that topic. Is that, is that my understanding? Absolutely.
[00:31:12] I want to pause for a moment to talk about our episode sponsor are one of my favorite companies out

[00:32:34] Don't you wish it was more complicated than that? It would sort of be like, oh, let's talk about
[00:32:39] this though. How so you're a guy who you're you didn't grow up wanting to be a broadcaster. You didn't
[00:32:45] want to be a streamer. You didn't want to be a personality online, necessarily. You just knew that
[00:32:53] you were modeling some of these some of these people that have come before you and trying to figure out
[00:32:58] a gap in the market. And you know, it was funny because you were talking about Brian Tracy.
[00:33:02] One of my favorite Brian Tracy quotes is something like, well, he says sales solve all problems.
[00:33:10] And we would just maybe refrain refrain that to leads solve all problems because they really do,
[00:33:16] right? I mean, this is a business of leads. And of course, it's a business of service and all
[00:33:21] of the other things too, but leads are what keep the engine running. And you know, leads can come
[00:33:26] from a lot of different sources. But you basically saw your idea was, I don't want to go out into the
[00:33:31] public that much. That's not really what I'm best at. You know, I'm not the guy on the billboard
[00:33:37] or you know, racing around all these different events, you know, I want to be the guy, you know,
[00:33:43] people are doing all this searching online. I want to be the guy they go to for that. And you know,
[00:33:49] when you started making videos, you talked about reading about it, learning production,
[00:33:56] how difficult was it for you to, did you, did you have a, I need these videos to look perfect?
[00:34:03] Or were you willing to, to experiment and try different methods? Because I know a lot of listeners
[00:34:09] are like, I don't know anything about video production. That's not what I do. So how complicated are
[00:34:15] your video shoots? Pretty basic. So I don't, I don't think I've ever, the only videos I've ever
[00:34:22] re-recorded or the ones that I didn't record audio or something like that and whenever I made it.
[00:34:27] But that's only been a couple of times. I think for me, it was, no, I wasn't seeking this out.
[00:34:34] To me, I, I am a, we'll do what it takes to get things done type of person. So really, the thing is,
[00:34:40] as I grew up in a pretty neutral environment, I would say that my parents, as much as I love them,
[00:34:46] they never encouraged me to do anything with my life. They were, they were just kind of like,
[00:34:53] really, their mindset was is the, the, the most thing I heard ever come from my mom was,
[00:34:58] we can't afford that. So we grew up with a very poor mentality, with the same, same thing as far
[00:35:04] as you're never going to go to college. I mean, literally, it wasn't, my parents weren't like,
[00:35:09] hey, let's figure out a way you can get to college. It was like, well, we didn't go to college,
[00:35:13] your two older brothers didn't go to college and you're not. That's not in your future.
[00:35:18] Yeah, because we're, we can't afford it. And that's all they, like, I don't even think they
[00:35:22] understood about scholarships to. Yeah, yeah, because they, they never said, Levi, get good grades,
[00:35:29] get a scholarship, you know, none of that. I mean, it was just, it was not in there, in their, in
[00:35:35] their window, you know, and so, yeah. So that was the thing is that, and they never, I remember,
[00:35:40] like in a second grade, I wanted to be an astronaut, but they never bought me a popular mechanics
[00:35:47] magazine or, you know, encourage that in any way there. And so I think I was always a little
[00:35:54] lost. And so I remember I met someone like Michael and he was like, hey, just sell some gym
[00:36:01] memberships with me. I was like, okay, cool, you know, and then seeing someone like Brian Tracey,
[00:36:05] who talked about, oh, if you read, I mean, whatever you want to do, you can go out there and
[00:36:10] read about it and learn it and apply it and take action. And I was like, oh, brilliant, you know,
[00:36:17] genius, okay, okay, I can do that. And, you know, and then I got deployed. Well, when I got deployed,
[00:36:23] I thought a lot about what I wanted to do whenever I came back. And really, I wanted to get into
[00:36:27] real estate investing, but I didn't, I just got a job selling cell phones. But I knew from learning
[00:36:35] from Michael, I was like, I want to be the best at selling cell phones. And so what did I do?
[00:36:40] Went to the best salesperson. Hey, what are you doing? How did you do that? How did you get there?
[00:36:44] Takes some little tips. And then I was like, how do I adjust it to fit my personality? How can I do
[00:36:48] better? And of course, I beat them at their own game and became the best. Well, from there, I got
[00:36:53] recruited to a pharmaceutical company. The first thing I did in the farm company was, as I said,
[00:36:59] who's the best salesperson, which you can see them at the top of the charts. And he happened to be
[00:37:04] living in Oklahoma. It's three hours from Dallas. I asked my manager, hey, can I do all my calls
[00:37:11] Monday through Thursday and can I go Friday? Can I go drive up to Oklahoma and spend the day with
[00:37:15] this top salesperson? And he was blown away. Nobody had ever asked him in the years and years
[00:37:22] and years he'd been amazing. Yeah. And so I got up, you know, and that salesperson was starting
[00:37:27] at like eight in the morning. So I had to get up, drive three hours to Oklahoma, meet him by 8 a.m.
[00:37:33] And then I spent the whole day with him and drove back. But that was the things I was willing to do
[00:37:37] to just to try to try to be the best. And it took it took within 12 months. I was I never got to
[00:37:45] number one, but I got to number four out of 160 sales reps nationwide. But I did that in less than
[00:37:52] 12 months. And that's amazing. Easy to do in the pharmaceutical world. Well, from there, I transitioned
[00:37:58] into financial services. Whenever I got licensed for that and got into that business, the first
[00:38:03] thing I did was went to the best person I knew and learned from them and then figured out how to
[00:38:07] do it better. And I blew past them their production. You know, like they told me their best production
[00:38:14] was 1.3 million the first year. And that's a lot whenever you're talking about just getting up,
[00:38:21] monthly accounts built up for teachers. Well, I did 1.5 the first my first year. And so,
[00:38:27] you know, when I was making that transition into real estate, that's why I was really scared to
[00:38:33] death because I had not heard, you know, you hear about all the failures more than you hear
[00:38:39] of the successes. Well, there's a lot more there's a lot more failures than successes in real estate.
[00:38:43] Oh, yeah. And and if you hit 100,000 in your first year in real estate, you're a major success.
[00:38:50] You are a super superstar. Yeah. So, but I was like, I'm not good with 100,000. And also,
[00:38:58] what I just saw people doing was the same traditional ways, right? And so that's what scared me
[00:39:05] to death because I was like, I still wanted to come in and be successful and just be the best
[00:39:11] at real estate. I was like, and that's what held me back for so long too, because I never had the
[00:39:15] desire to do it. And I thought, you know, if I do move into that, I want to do this as fast as
[00:39:22] possible. I don't know if that's possible. But, you know, could I get to 200 or 300,000? That's what I
[00:39:27] was really thinking. Could I get to two or three or 400,000 in my first year? Because then I would
[00:39:32] feel like I made an impact. I'm off to a good start. And that's and and by that time, if you can do
[00:39:40] that, you've clearly cracked some code, right? It's not just, hey, I got lucky because I grew up here
[00:39:46] and all my friends still live here. And they just happened to all need to buy a condo or sell a condo
[00:39:50] this year. This is a whole different thing that nobody locally had even done, right? So, yes,
[00:39:58] there's a YouTube channels with 7,000, which is very meager, really. I mean, it's not really if
[00:40:05] you're doing it, that could be enough to generate tons of tons of business. But I'm guessing those other
[00:40:09] channels probably weren't generating a ton of business. So you didn't even have a really amazing
[00:40:15] blueprint. You did have you do we're kind of placing a bet? Well, going back to your question as far
[00:40:21] as the thing what I understood was in my research was that what I realized was, here's why I was
[00:40:27] at the position I was at because over my career of sales, gym memberships, cell phones,
[00:40:35] pharmaceuticals, and retirement plans, it was always me. It was one-to-one selling. And so every time
[00:40:43] I stopped or when I transitioned from cell phones to pharmaceuticals, I had nothing to show except
[00:40:48] a bunch of trophies from selling cell phones. When I went from pharmaceuticals to financial services,
[00:40:54] I had all the trophies from pharmaceuticals, but nothing came with me. No, in my-
[00:40:59] And plus it's not it's not as scalable, right? Like you it was you. It was you that was that was
[00:41:05] making all these sales and there wasn't an avenue like YouTube for real estate because you couldn't
[00:41:11] reach as easily a vast number of prospects in those other, you know, surfaces.
[00:41:17] Yep. Yeah. So and they were and there were jobs, of course, you can't really scale your job.
[00:41:22] You know, but when I went into financial services, that was when in the first time I started
[00:41:26] my own business. And I could bring on other reps and expand and I did that I brought on a
[00:41:33] couple of people, but the thing is is that the margins were small that I you know I had to cut into
[00:41:38] their cut, you know, if I wanted to make the overrides. And so I would bring on a few people and I
[00:41:45] just never felt right to me. I just thought man nobody is is going to make a serious living because
[00:41:51] I know that I'm a rare breed as well. Right. I'm confident in my sales ability and I know I know
[00:41:58] I'm a good salesperson and I know I'm in the top 1% and I've proven that in in four different
[00:42:04] industries. And I know that not everybody's that good of a salesperson. So in the financial services,
[00:42:12] I was going to be very difficult to find somebody like me that could sell as well as me. But then
[00:42:16] Yeah, it's hard to duplicate you. Yeah, if they didn't do that, if they didn't do that, they weren't
[00:42:20] going to make a good living either. So it never set wealth me. So I never scaled that accordingly
[00:42:24] because that was more of a just a personal conflict with myself was I didn't feel like I could
[00:42:30] get somebody on full time that could you could you know earn a full time living. So so that's what those
[00:42:36] were the questions I asked myself over the summer because and that's what kept me from getting in
[00:42:40] the real estate is because I did not want to go into one to one selling again. I didn't want to be
[00:42:45] the one shaking hands kissing babies doing the transactions. And and so or making the calls because
[00:42:52] you know as soon as you hang up the phone, your lead generation stops. And so I wanted to build something
[00:42:57] that was scalable something that that I could you know, I wasn't the factor, you know, and so that
[00:43:02] way if a pandemic or illness or you know, economy or something like that took me out of the picture
[00:43:07] whether temporarily or permanent, I could still have a business running on the back end. So that's
[00:43:13] just all the questions that I had to ask myself. So that's the other part of why we's grown so quickly.
[00:43:19] Oh, and so going back to your original question as far as camera presence, it wasn't hard for me
[00:43:24] because what I learned what I realized was all video is its communication and cells at scale.
[00:43:31] And so I was like, well shoot, if I can make videos, I can have the conversation once with that camera,
[00:43:38] but now I'm giving the it's still once a one, but a hundred a thousand,
[00:43:43] ten, fifteen thousand people to see that conversation. And so this is what I tell agents now is like,
[00:43:49] you do this every day. If I went to your neighborhood right now to buy a home, you could take me
[00:43:55] around all day long, tell me everything I needed to know about that neighborhood, the schools,
[00:44:00] the fun things to do. You could tell me all of that, but when I leave, it's gone. It's done. The
[00:44:08] conversation is dead forever. It'll never be resurrected. So stop doing that. Have that exact
[00:44:14] conversation you'd have with me and have it on camera. And now you can tell thousands of people
[00:44:18] and give them the opportunity to see that. That's passive prospecting. That is doing the cells pitch
[00:44:24] once and letting something else do all the work for you. Everybody loves the idea of passive income,
[00:44:31] but what do you have to do? You have to do the work upfront and put a system, a process,
[00:44:36] in place so that it constantly works for you on the back end, right? Because no matter what
[00:44:41] anybody says passive income still takes a little bit of tweaks here and there, right? And you
[00:44:46] yeah, look at it. But all video is passive prospecting. It's the same concept. We're taking the time,
[00:44:54] energy and effort to make that video. But once I've done that, it's done and it's going to work,
[00:45:00] not just 24 seven, but in a compound effect of time because making video does not take time,
[00:45:06] it makes you time and not only does it make you time, it compounds time. So that is always
[00:45:11] prospecting. That's why I don't feel bad now about traveling, taking the days off,
[00:45:16] taking the weekends off, going to conferences, going on vacation because videos still get published
[00:45:21] and leads still come in no matter what I'm doing. It's yes, everything you've said is apps,
[00:45:30] you know, it's funny. This is how this is an embarrassing thing. I'll admit that really speaks
[00:45:35] to everything you just said. So I recruit REALTORS. So I'm a bit different because I'm not a
[00:45:40] producing agent. I recruit for our company. And I'm doing it the same way I've been doing it since
[00:45:46] 2010, which is we have, well, we have people that make calls and say, hey, would you like to talk
[00:45:51] about switching firms and then they set up an appointment? And then I schedule a 30 minute meeting
[00:45:55] and I do my pitch. And 95% of the conversation is me explaining everything that we offer because
[00:46:02] that's why people are scheduling the appointment. You know, I'll do five minutes of like, hey, tell me
[00:46:06] about you. What are you looking for? What's, you know, you're having problems that you're
[00:46:09] existing for blah, blah, blah. Find, make sure I know what they want. But then I got to present for
[00:46:14] 25 minutes because that's what they're there to hear. And I've been doing that the exact same way
[00:46:20] for, well, for 12 years now. And this whole time I'm going, why don't I have a video that does
[00:46:27] most of this? Like, maybe it doesn't do the full 25 minutes, but it does like 20 minutes of it.
[00:46:31] And prior to the meeting, I go, hey, you know, just to save you time, Mr. and Mrs. Prospect,
[00:46:37] I'd like you to watch this video because honestly, you know, you can learn most everything we do.
[00:46:42] And then I'm going to call you at the time that we have scheduled. And we're going to have a better
[00:46:45] conversation because now you'll know kind of what we offer. I can have sort of next level
[00:46:48] conversations with you and you can, you know, it'll just be better. I don't know why I haven't done
[00:46:53] that yet. And you just reminded me that what I'm doing isn't scalable. And it's no different,
[00:46:59] really, then, you know, somebody meeting with a buyer for the first time, which by the way,
[00:47:04] if you're doing that one to one, awesome, good. I'm not here to tell you that that's a bad idea. But
[00:47:09] what if you had a video with somebody, I mean, we're now we're sort of beginning into a different
[00:47:13] realm. But if we had a video that said, Hey, Mr. and Mrs. first time home buyer, before we meet in
[00:47:18] person, I'd like you to watch this 15 minute video. It'll help prepare for the meeting. But anyway,
[00:47:23] this will save time for the agent. So it, you know, YouTube. And again, I'm sorry. So that was
[00:47:30] just one. No, two, no, two thing. You guys, please, please, two very important things about that.
[00:47:34] Number one, I do the exact same thing. So what's your brokerage? It's called kale like the vegetable.
[00:47:40] Okay. So I'm, you know, I'm with the XP and we, you know, we do agent attraction. The thing is
[00:47:46] is that I've never explained the XP business model to anybody. If they book a partner call with me,
[00:47:52] what happens is as soon as they book that call, I have an automation that sends them the eXp explained
[00:47:58] video. Because, and I say in the message, Hey, by the way, since we're going to be chatting about
[00:48:02] eXp, it's best you watch this video about the brokerage model. So that you have all the context you
[00:48:07] need and can ask the right questions when we get on the call. And so instead of them asking me,
[00:48:13] okay, what's the split? What's the right, which is what I deal with all the time? Yeah. That,
[00:48:18] you know, you know, those are done. Yeah. You know, they're number one. Every time I get on a call now,
[00:48:22] what their number one question is? No. How does this work? How do I, how do I, how do I move,
[00:48:28] why side, how do I move over? Yeah. So it's, it's the logistics of it. That's what their question is
[00:48:33] about. Sure. And then, and then we just chit chat. We kind of like, oh, so, where'd you grow up?
[00:48:38] You know, and then we just kind of go back and forth. So that, that's done the heavy lifting for me.
[00:48:43] Now, to your other point on the real estate side, the video builds the relationship for you.
[00:48:49] See, the thing is that nobody hardly watches one video and calls us. They end up watching 5, 10,
[00:48:54] 15, 20 videos. So whenever they come to us, number one, the, the relationship is already there
[00:49:00] on their side. They already feel like they know, like, and trust us. Right. And they, when they call
[00:49:05] us, they've already made the decision that they want to work with us. And so, and they feel like
[00:49:11] they know you, because it will, and this, this is the thing that, that people don't realize,
[00:49:15] it actually builds, and it may be it's artificial in a sense, but it's irrelevant because it works.
[00:49:20] It builds a connection between you and the audience because you are speaking one to one,
[00:49:25] even though that video's reaching tens of thousands of people possibly, it is a one to one
[00:49:30] relationship each time somebody pushes play. Yep. Absolutely. So how often do they feel like they
[00:49:36] know you? They're like, it's, it's probably, I've talked to other YouTubers who say it's,
[00:49:41] it's kind of funny in a way because people will talk to me as if they're already my friend,
[00:49:44] because they're so used to watching my content. They're so hooked on my content. They're like,
[00:49:48] I got to work with this guy. And by the time you end up talking to them, I imagine, you're right.
[00:49:52] You're not, they, they, they know they at least know and like you and hopefully trust you by then.
[00:49:57] But they know they like you because they're calling you or they're contacting you or reaching out.
[00:50:01] And they know you know what you're talking about, because you've demonstrated that value
[00:50:05] through these videos. Yep. Yeah. And I mean, people, you know, get recognized around
[00:50:12] town. It's funny because I was in the, I was actually at the airport the other day in the TSA line.
[00:50:17] And somebody started tugging on my sleeve and I looked over and I didn't see anybody. And then I
[00:50:22] looked down and it was this like 85 year old four foot lady. And she's just looking up. Man,
[00:50:28] I was like, I said, hello. And she goes, she goes, are you the YouTube real estate guy?
[00:50:32] I loved your 10 things to hate about playing a video. Yeah. I said, yeah, as
[00:50:39] mean, she's like, I like love your videos. And then she just walked on by, you know, and that's,
[00:50:43] and it's funny. It's happened in in clothing stores and coffee shops and coming in and out of my
[00:50:49] office. It's like people are like, Hey, hey, you know, I was getting food the other day. And the
[00:50:53] guy standing next to me in line is sitting there staring at me. And I'm just like, Hey, and he goes,
[00:50:57] because don't you make YouTube videos? And I was like, yeah, yeah. And he's like, oh, cool.
[00:51:02] You know, and it's just funny. And so you are building that up. And it's around this whole,
[00:51:06] you know, that's the thing is, is right now, especially in this market, I believe the most
[00:51:10] visible agent's going to win. So now that doesn't mean you have to be on video. But if you're a postcard
[00:51:16] person, you should probably send more postcards. If you're an email person, you should probably
[00:51:21] send more emails. If you're a phone call person, you need to make more phone calls. You can be visible
[00:51:25] on the phone when you're actually having conversations with people. So if you're a caller,
[00:51:30] you need to call more people in this market. And so right now, I want to pause for a second,
[00:51:34] because I want to make a pretty strong point is that I think I think you'll agree with this.
[00:51:40] You talked about, you just talked about postcards, email, you know, phone calls. Those are all you
[00:51:46] reaching out to the customer. People don't like emails, right? And again, I'm just generalizing.
[00:51:53] Obviously, there's nothing wrong with sending emails. But generally speaking, we don't,
[00:51:56] we don't love unwanted emails or certainly too many of them. We don't want too many phone calls.
[00:52:01] We don't want too many postcards, I mean, postcards are pretty innocuous. But what you're doing is
[00:52:07] they're coming to you because they're searching for the content they want. There's no resistance
[00:52:12] at that point. There's no like, who's this guy calling me? It's, oh, this guy's providing me
[00:52:17] content. I found him. He didn't find me. So we call that, and actually we talk about that.
[00:52:23] That's, I believe that's the first chapter in passive prospecting is interruption versus
[00:52:28] intentional marketing. So what you just described as interruption marketing, it's what we've,
[00:52:32] we've been conditioned to be a part of and conduct as business people are whole lives. That's
[00:52:39] TV commercials, billboards, magazine ads, postcards, cold calling, door knocking, that is interrupting.
[00:52:43] They say right now we get exposed to eight to 10,000 ads per day. Okay.
[00:52:49] Incredible. Now we're not buying that many products, which, which means we're completely ignoring
[00:52:53] them. Right. So, but they're interrupting you. And this thing is that you could see a dog food
[00:52:58] commercial 10 times a day. Doesn't mean you're going to go buy dog food. Right. I don't care how many
[00:53:02] times you see Jake from State Farm, you're not going to go run out and buy insurance. But the second
[00:53:08] you have a kid and you need, you need a new life policy or you need to update it or you run out,
[00:53:14] let's say you run out of dog food, you do not need any marketing or advertising to convince you
[00:53:20] to go do that. You now have intention. And now, now you're on the hunt. Now you're out there
[00:53:26] looking and guess what? People are intentional about buying or selling real estate. But most real estate
[00:53:31] agents chase after everybody else saying that they're in the relationship business trying to build
[00:53:37] relationships when all they're doing is really interrupting people nonstop. So hopefully one day,
[00:53:42] when they're finally in the market, they'll actually think of them and buy or sell a home with
[00:53:46] them. And then they end up buying a home from Uncle Bob because he's over at their house,
[00:53:49] drinking beer on a Sunday afternoon. And you're like, I've been chasing you down for 18 months. And
[00:53:53] they're like, well, sorry, Uncle Bob is over at my house. And you know, I just listed with him. So
[00:53:59] intentional means people are intentional about buying and selling real estate. But what if you're the
[00:54:04] person that's in front of them, whenever they're there, they're now searching for that information.
[00:54:08] When people go to research on YouTube and they search Dallas, guess what? They're going to get hit
[00:54:14] with all of our videos because we pop up everywhere. They can't avoid us. And so now they, and then
[00:54:20] they just start watching the content. Guess what? It's immediate value add. We don't sell them on the
[00:54:25] fact that we're real estate agents. We don't, you know, tell them about here's the tips to sell your
[00:54:30] home. It's like here's all the information about Dallas, what they're actually searching for. And so
[00:54:34] we just become their agent by default because they end up consuming so much content that, that,
[00:54:40] you know, they just can't help themselves. And I'm like, well, I'm going to go call this guy.
[00:54:43] Yeah. Well, yes, yes. And again, you haven't created resistance because you're not pitching
[00:54:50] them directly. I mean, maybe at the end of the video's, oh, hey, by the way, if you know,
[00:54:54] there may be some of that and that's that's fine. But they already found you. You didn't find them.
[00:54:58] You didn't pitch them first. And, and that is, that is just beyond beyond huge. So tell us about
[00:55:04] passive prospecting.com. Yeah, it's our website. I mean, the main thing we're doing right there is
[00:55:10] directing people to sign up to be the first to know when we release the new book. So we have
[00:55:15] written the book passive prospecting. It's in, it's in process right now. The publisher that
[00:55:21] we're working with has told us probably a February timeframe as far as release. So right now,
[00:55:27] if you go to passive prospecting.com, you'll see on the homepage, you can just sign up. And so that
[00:55:31] way, we'll notify you as soon as the book releases, because we do want to create some, some
[00:55:37] emphasis and some push around whenever that launches. It's going to be awesome. But it's, it's 14
[00:55:43] chapters. I mean, and so it's, it's a, it's a lot, it's a lot of information. And, and we tell you,
[00:55:49] we talk about all the principles in the first half of the book and the second half of the book is
[00:55:54] how to apply them and how to build your own channel. So it's really going to be, really, I think
[00:56:01] everything you need. Now, the thing is you'll be missing the visual component, which I think, you know,
[00:56:06] like, like we walk through people through a digital course when we help them learn YouTube,
[00:56:11] which they can see. And it's very easy. But the book, I mean, that, some people learn from reading
[00:56:17] and writing. And so we, we walk them through everything that they need to get through that. And so
[00:56:22] we just talk about that. And, and the cool thing is is we got the forward. The forward was written
[00:56:28] by Ryan Sirhand. Oh, wonderful. Well, that's, that's certainly some nice social proof to help,
[00:56:34] help, help sell some books. And yeah, I, I need to get, I need to see if I can get him on our show.
[00:56:39] We've, yeah, I just, I haven't over all the years. I need to. But yes, but that's amazing.
[00:56:44] Congratulations on that. He's not an easy get. We, we actually have had him booked a couple of times
[00:56:50] over the years. And then it did, it just fell through. So that is, that is really impressive.
[00:56:55] And I, again, I just want to wrap this up with you don't have to be, you know, you don't have
[00:57:02] to have a special hook. You don't have to be, you know, the, the, the, the TikTok dancing family.
[00:57:09] Although, if that's your hook, great. But what, all you, all you can, you know, all you really need
[00:57:15] to do is focus on your expertise, which is hyper local real estate. Think of the questions your,
[00:57:21] your clients ask you when they move in or move out. Think of the things they need, the thing,
[00:57:26] and then you can, you know, God, there's a million tools to look up search volume. Take a,
[00:57:30] and again, just the biggest mind shift change that I'm making in this, in this conversation is,
[00:57:37] YouTube is not a place to watch videos. It's a search engine. It's a search engine first that
[00:57:42] happens to show you videos. And if I think of it that way, then it becomes a research and development
[00:57:48] tool versus, and also, you know, you know, fun thing if I want to screw around on YouTube.
[00:57:53] But I can actually use it for research and development. Whereas Instagram, Facebook,
[00:57:58] and even TikTok, you're at the mercy of either the people you already know or in TikTok's,
[00:58:04] you know, case a little bit differently. You know, they, they have a sort of a different algorithm
[00:58:08] set. But, you know, Facebook is people, you know, for the most part, maybe some people find you
[00:58:13] here and there through referrals. Instagram's essentially the same way. So all you're really,
[00:58:17] and there's nothing wrong with creating content for your, your followers. But it's not easy to
[00:58:22] sort of branch outside of those followers in those platforms. It's really tough because that's
[00:58:26] just not what those platforms are for. Instagram tries to be a search engine. I don't think it does
[00:58:31] that all that successfully. But certainly YouTube has as the cream of the crop that's where everyone
[00:58:38] goes to learn how to do and how to do something or how or about something. You know, my, my, my dad was
[00:58:45] like, I, he just, you know, he goes around and fixes things all over the house. He checks everything
[00:58:49] on YouTube first, like, like a lot of us do. So I absolutely love this. And we all have essentially 4K
[00:58:56] phones with incredible resolution, incredible clarity. You don't even have to have necessarily
[00:59:04] really amazing equipment. What you do have to have is really amazing content, which is what you have,
[00:59:11] if you're a real estate agent who cares and actually works on their craft, you just take the information
[00:59:17] you already have and and apply it and make videos. Well, just real quickly, what's the, have you found
[00:59:23] to be an optimal length or or for your videos to for the, where the audience stays engaged or do you
[00:59:31] find it's kind of all over the board? Videos need to be as long as they need to be. So give the
[00:59:41] information that's needed to create the video. Don't keep talking just to keep talking. So if the
[00:59:48] videos 12 minutes and 19 seconds, let it be that if it's 15 minutes and 18 seconds, I mean, I've
[00:59:54] been, I've even done an hour video on, on the channel as an experiment. And it's one of the most
[01:00:01] viewed and most watched videos on the channel. So the thing is, is again, when your audience is
[01:00:06] researching, you, you have their attention because you know their intention. So when you know their
[01:00:12] intention, you will have their attention. And so a longer form video, that's what they're there for.
[01:00:18] And that's what gets people dialed in and builds that relationship for you because they watch more
[01:00:25] and more content the longer they watch it, the more of the relationship they develop and deepen with
[01:00:29] you. So, so yeah, I mean, the shortest maybe 10 minutes, the longest I've done an hour and everything
[01:00:36] in between. So I, I make videos and the thing is I didn't intentionally make an hour video,
[01:00:41] but I knew it was going to be a lot because I was going to cover a lot. And at the end of it,
[01:00:45] it was like, Oh, that's an hour. So, you know, it is what it is. And I thought, well, we'll see what
[01:00:50] happens. But again, still one of the most popular, one of the most viewed videos. So it just told me
[01:00:55] that, okay, people are, are dialed in when they're researching. I mean, making a move is a big
[01:01:00] decision for a lot of people and people do research that. But think about how do they actually research
[01:01:05] that from before? I mean, we've also helped people move from Japan, from Belgium, from the Philippines,
[01:01:12] from Australia, from the UK, from South Africa. Where would else would they have found us other
[01:01:18] than YouTube? I mean, do you think those people would have just randomly discovered our website
[01:01:22] or our Facebook profile? No, no, they're going to search Dallas first because they're moving here
[01:01:30] because of a job, because of a better opportunity, because of a transfer of this or that, you know,
[01:01:35] and so they're saying, well, what's Dallas like? Let's go on YouTube and take a look. Let's see what
[01:01:41] Dallas looks like. And then guess what? All of our videos pop up over and over again. And so they're like,
[01:01:47] hey, moving from Belgium, you know, which we just got that email two weeks ago. And that's what the
[01:01:54] lady said, used to live in Florida, lived in Belgium the last six years. Now we're getting transfer
[01:01:58] to Dallas. So so again, in essentially one year, we're talking 164 transactions, 90 million in
[01:02:08] production, almost three million in commissions. These results speak for themselves. I don't need to
[01:02:13] say anything other than I want to read that book. So the best place and by the way, everybody needs
[01:02:19] to read this book because even if you're not a YouTuber, even if you're not somebody that thinks
[01:02:24] this is a viable path, I am guessing that with the rates have, you know, essentially doubled since
[01:02:29] since and I don't like to even say rates have doubled because they were such low. Of course,
[01:02:34] they were going to double, but regardless, it's still a tricky time to generate leads. So if you're
[01:02:39] doing the traditional methods, then you know, you're going to just have a lot of people sitting on
[01:02:43] the sidelines. There's only a certain percentage of your sphere of influence that are going to be buying
[01:02:47] or selling in the next 12 months. And you're probably a little stressed about it right now. I know
[01:02:51] all of our agents are this provides you even if you're like, that's not really what I'm not really
[01:02:57] a online personality. It doesn't you don't need to necessarily be an online personality. What you
[01:03:03] need to do, I mean, I don't care who does. I watched the video last night. I had to replace a
[01:03:09] a switch. I have like a smart switch light switch essentially and it has a dimmer and whatever. So
[01:03:14] anyway, I had to switch it and I was like, I better just double check that I've got these wires,
[01:03:19] you know, connected correctly. Or I'm going to blow up my whole home. And I watched a one-minute
[01:03:24] video. It was a guy who was not a YouTube personality, but he had the most views for this particular
[01:03:30] so you know, wiring for outlet. It had like three million views and this it was a one-minute video.
[01:03:36] This guy could not have been less personable. And yet his content was good and it was quick and
[01:03:42] it works. And so even if you're not somebody who's like, oh, I'm not as dynamic, maybe I'm
[01:03:48] more introverted, it doesn't matter. You just have to have that incredible content. And yes,
[01:03:52] you should learn how to make things look good and sound good and you should be really intentional
[01:03:56] about, you know, the way you're speaking. And there's a lot to learn. But regardless,
[01:04:00] I just watched a video last night. This guy basically saved my life. And he is not dynamic. So I
[01:04:06] just want to make that point that if you're thinking about, you know, another way to generate
[01:04:11] income because like, like Levi was saying, you can create a really great piece of content. It
[01:04:17] might generate traffic for a very long time or even forever, I guess, and you know, could be.
[01:04:23] And so you have this opportunity to create something that lasts. Social media is very digestible.
[01:04:30] It's very, it's very transient. It comes and goes. We do the infinite scroll. But YouTube stuff
[01:04:37] kind of lasts forever. Now something better might come along and replace you. And then you can
[01:04:42] create another video to replace that person, you know, so, you know, that can happen. But essentially,
[01:04:48] if it's good, it lasts. And I see this all the time, like this video about replacing the electrical
[01:04:54] wiring. He made it like 10 years ago. And it's still the best video, 10 years. And you would think
[01:05:01] some electrician has got a better personality is more dynamic can make it. I mean, this guy literally
[01:05:06] was literally, it was just his webcam. He was holding it up. There was no production. And 10,
[01:05:13] you know, like 10 million views or something. So anyway, let's, let's all visit passive prospecting.com.

Alright, enough from me. Let's get to the main event. My conversation with Levi Lassick. Today on the show, we have Levi Lassick who released his first YouTube video on December 5th, 2020 as a... I really want you guys to listen to this biography because what I'm about to tell you is going to sound almost impossible. So I'm going to start this over. If anyone was just possibly listening, I want you to actively listen for about the next 20 seconds. So Levi Lassick released his first YouTube video on December 5th, 2020 as a brand new real estate agent. And he had not sold a home in 2020 or the first quarter of 2021. So again, he started his first YouTube video in December of 2020. He hadn't sold a home that entire year and the first quarter of 2021 also, no home sold. Levi partnered with Travis Plum and they closed their first two transactions from the YouTube channel. In other words, leads they received from their video in April of 2021. Now that's the second quarter of 2021. Over... Now here's the incredible part. Over the next year, they generated 164 transactions, which equaled 90 million in production. And this just makes me cry because I want... I wish this was not my story and not Levi's. 2.7 million in commissions with... And this is the really incredible part even with all of that being said, zero ad spend. So they now own the fastest growing and most viewed real estate YouTube channel in Dallas, Texas. And they generate no joke, three to five qualified inbound leads every single day. Now you guys got to check this out. I want you to do two things. I want you to go first to get hooked on Levi's content because he has amazing content for you, the agent, which is passive prospecting.com. He's got a book. We're going to talk about that. And he really wants you to take a look at it. And also, I want you to watch what he's doing on YouTube, which is also passive prospecting search for that channel. We will have links to both those... We'll have both those links in the show notes. Levi, welcome to the show. Thanks for having me. Appreciate it. I don't know that I... I don't know that I... in the 430 episodes or whatever we've done. I don't think I've ever interrupted myself in the middle of a reading someone's bio, but I was like, no, I have to make a big deal about this because you're not the first person we've had on the show that has really built a solid hyper local brand on YouTube. But you're the one who's had probably the most success so quickly. And it's just... I am like tongue tied. I'm not sure exactly what to even ask you because this is even blowing me away. But let's get... Let's start at the very beginning of the story before we get into sort of how you did all this. How and why did you get into real estate? Reluctantly. That's why I've got a friend, Michael Rees. Do you know Michael? You ever met Michael Rees? I don't think so. Okay. Well, I've known him for 20 years and he got licensed in 2002. And we actually sold gym memberships together, Bali Total Fitness. So he... That's a rough job by the way. Oh, hey, we worked 12 hours a day, seven days a week. And that was literally... So that's... And I did that one hour. I was like 20, 21 years old. So I just got out of military and I needed a job. And that's the thing is is Michael. First of all, he sold me the most expensive membership there on a three-year contract, which I couldn't afford at all whatsoever. And then he eventually just recruited me because I had this $8 an hour job. And that was it. I was doing labor work and I lost that job. And then he recruited me, which was great because I couldn't pay for my gym membership. I think I went up there to tell him I needed to cancel it somehow and get me out of my three-year contract and blah, blah, blah. And he's like, well, just come work for me. And I was like, okay, cool. And then I started working 12 hours a day, seven days a week, making phone calls. Literally, we would phone call 10 hours a day. Yeah, to try to get five appointments the next day. That was the whole goal. You were not allowed to stop calling until you had five appointments the next day. And if you got your five appointments next day, they're like, well, go ahead and start on the day after. So anyways, just call for 10 hours straight because we would start at 10 a.m. The ship was literally 10 a.m. to 10 p.m. But we couldn't call after 8 p.m. So we had a 10-hour window that we had to call and literally get in there at 10 a.m. and would start just hammering the smile in and dialing. Yeah. And then the whole goal was, of course, it was to have five people in the gym to tour them around to sell possibly two or three memberships a day. So it was it was brutal. But I didn't care. The thing was is that Michael was a sales machine and you know, and I just looked up to him and was like, a lot, if he can do it, I got to do better than him. That's all I've ever said. I have a very simple formula for success, which is who's at the top? How did they get there? You know, can I model that? Can I adjust it to fit my personality? And then can I do better than them? Very simple. And that's what I learned from the very beginning was Michael's like, well, look, here's what I'm doing. I'm making all these phone calls. Here's what you can do. Actually, they gave me the old lead book. They gave me the binder of all the old leads that everybody had already called 500 times and didn't want to call anymore. And so I just started calling them. And then what happened was, is within three weeks, I became the top salesperson there. And started even beat Michael. And I just figured out a better way to do it. And more creative ways. And then Michael took me to my first Brian Tracy. It was my first time I've been exposed to personal education, you know, or self-education. And he was like, hey, I'm going to see this guy. Brian Tracy talked. I was like, okay, cool. Didn't know who it was or it wasn't even thinking about that sort of thing. And Brian Tracy, toward the country, spoke for free, put on free events, of course, to sell all of his courses and CDs and everything at the back of the room. And I remember I just had a $300 credit card. It was my first credit card. I had a $300 limit. And it was supposed to be for emergencies. And that day I saw Brian Tracy speak. And I went to the back of the room and I bought as many programs as I could and maxed out that $300 credit card. And I remember I bought, I believe, six different programs. So I bought like the psychology of selling, the psychology of mindset. You know, I don't know. He just had all these programs and they were CDs. So they were the books with like six CDs. And yeah. And the cool thing was is I had this really crappy, that was really crappy, but it was a Volkswagen Jetta. But the one thing it had was a six CD changer. So I could put all six CDs in my six CD changer, which was in the trunk, by the way. They'll put the trunk and put it in there. And I would listen to the psychology of selling, you know, driving back and forth to the gym. And anywhere I went, I'd never listen to music really in my 20s, I believe. Everybody would ask me about the new bands and what did I like? And I'd be like, I don't know. I don't know who you're talking about really. Because I just, I just bought into that from the beginning. And I just, it just changed my perspective. And I just started consuming as much as possible. Now the thing was is I was in the reserves still. And in 2002, I remember the day Michael came back from meeting a guy named Jay Kinder at the lake. And he came back on Taballi's on Monday. I was like, I'm getting into real estate. You know, he's like, that screw this. And so, he's like, I'm getting into real estate. I was like, okay, cool. All right. Good luck. You know, and he's like, no, you got to come with me. Well, he got licensed 2002 finally talked me into it in 2004. So I did get licensed in 2004. But what happened was as soon as I completed my training, I had my license for I think about a week. And I got called up because I was still in the reserves. And they gave, you know, I got a call from the military and said, you're being reactivated. You're about to deploy and you're going to be gone for 18 months. And so, and so that was it. So I I literally and they gave me I think four days is like a four day notice. You know, and this was this was a 2004. So this was right in the height of, you know, I rack and Afghanistan. And so literally I remember getting that phone call. And they said, you've got four days to report to Fort Hood, you know, in Texas. And when that was it. So four days to say goodbye, pack my bags, you know, and that was it. And so I never, I never practiced real estate. I never did it. And the thing was as I was gone for 18 months and ended up spending a year of that over in Iraq. And whenever I got home in 2006, then I knew over that time frame, what I over I knew I didn't want to be a real estate agent. I realized, you know, being gone for 18 months, Michael just talked me into it. I really didn't want to be a real estate agent in the beginning. I got licensed just because he told me to. And then when I got deployed, I thought, maybe this is divine intervention. So whenever I came back, I didn't even, you know, the license expired. I didn't renew it. And I didn't become an agent. And so I went, I went on my own path from there. Now Michael and I have stayed friends over the last 20 years, watched each other grow and, you know, succeed and dip and all, you know, all this kind of thing. But, but yeah, it was really 2020. When my, my financial services business, I had contracts with Dallas, I was the, I worked with all the teachers on their retirement planning. And I've been doing that for the last five years. Very lucrative, very successful at that. And then, you know, April of 2020, all the school shut down. And whenever all the school shut down, everything I built up over five years, it just kind of was gone overnight. And you know, I'm sitting there at 41 years old, asking myself, okay, well, what just happened? How did I end up in this position? And how do I start over without starting over? So, you know, it was, it was an interesting time because I was sitting there thinking, all right, this when school going to come back, when's the world going to reopen? I mean, what's going to happen? Nobody knew, right? And so I couldn't meet with people. I used to meet with all the teachers on campus, of course, all the schools were shut down. None of the teachers knew how to work zoom. So nobody was trying to invest. They were all calling me to pull out money from their retirement. Sure. Sure. And I was just thinking, all right, well, what am I going to do now? And here comes Michael. Okay, now's the best time to get in a real estate. And I was like, bro, I don't want to be a real estate agent, you know? And he's like, but I'm telling you, man, and the thing is with Michael, Michael has always seen the potential and everybody that he, and he knows how to also pull that out of people as well. And I think, you know, Michael just knows me as a person in general, ever since we sold gym memberships, we spent a lot of time together and watching each other over the years. He knows who I am. He knows my work ethic. He knows what I'm capable of. And I think that's why he just never gave up on trying to get me in the business and always wanted to work with me again. As I always wanted to work with him, but I just never wanted to be the real estate agent. So I said, well, as long as you're an agent, I'm probably, we're probably not going to work together. Just because I had no desire to do that. I was interested in investing. I like investing and I flipped a few properties here and there. I've had rentals, you know, so I've done transactions. And I enjoyed that part of it, but I was a part time, you know, I was a part time investor. So I did one or two fixed reflips a year. I did have seven rentals at one time. So, but I always worked with an agent. So even during that time, I never renewed my license because I just again, to me, it wasn't worth it to try to make a little extra commission. I'd rather just work with somebody that could handle that, build it into the price and just be done with it. Sure. So that was it. So over 2020, he was, he was like, hey man, now's the best time to get in the real estate. And as I looked at everything over the summer of 2020, every industry was going down the tank, except for real estate. It was probably one of the only industries other than online shopping that started to increase during 2020. Sure. And so I thought, well, you know, if I'm going to make them move, maybe this is the time to do it. However, I was, I was literally scared to death, you know, because I was, first of all, I'm 41 years old at that time. And I'm 43 now, but I was 41 going, okay, how do you, again, how do you start over without starting over? I mean, how do I, how do I get into a new industry, a new business? And is there a way to jumpstart that is how am I, how am I going to compete with every agent in Dallas that's been in the business for five, 10, 15, 30 years when one of the most competitive markets? How am I going to position myself? Am I going to have to go out there and shake hands and kiss babies and, you know, go to all these neighborhood events and start, and I was, that I was just not really interested in either, you know, nothing wrong with that at all. But I was just thinking, I'm at a different point in my life, you know, I love the movie, The Boiler Room, but I'm just not into all the phone calls anymore. You already, you already did your time on the phone. Yeah, yeah. I mean, I, I can do it. I just didn't want to do it. And I was just thinking, okay, well, one thing that Michael said to me that always resonated was, and I, and I heard him speak, you know, to other groups and do trainings. And, you know, one thing he said that always stood out to me was, he said, he said, it's not the best real estate agent that wins. It's the best marketer. And so as I thought about that more, I was just thinking, well, if I'm moving to real estate, instead of getting into real estate and then trying to figure out a plan, I just thought, let me figure out a plan. And if I can figure out a plan, maybe I'll get into real estate, if I can see a viable option for myself. And if it, and if the best marketer wins, then I need a good marketing plan. And I need to find a way to attract business. And how can I bring people to me versus me having to go out there, pound the pavement, shake hands, kiss babies, try to build a brand from scratch to be known and compete with every Joe Bob and Susie out there selling real estate. Is there a gap too? I was like, is there a gap in the market? Is there an actual gap in Dallas real estate that I could slip into somehow and attract business and bring people to me so that the traffic is inbound? Well, there's only really, I think, the way to do that this day and age quickly is through social media. And so I knew that. And so I was like, okay, it's likely going to be social media because I also knew I didn't want to start a postcard campaign. And I didn't want to start a magazine and a billboard and start spending a ton of money, especially in the middle of a pandemic where who knows what was going to happen anyways. And even going out and meeting people or events, all that stuff was still very questionable even for Texas. I mean, I'm in Dallas, Texas and we were open faster than anybody other than Florida. So, but still people were still a little on the fence about events and things like that. So, so I was just thinking, okay, social media, all right. Well, so I started looking at people, you know, agents that that Michael knew and everyone was like, okay, Instagram, TikTok, Facebook, especially TikTok. I mean, every agent that seemed like in 2020 woke up with 10,000 TikTok followers. You know, and so everyone was going, you got to be on TikTok, right? TikTok where it's at. And I'm like, well, how much business did you get from that? Well, you know, I get a lot of inquiries. A lot of people say, hey, I'm interested, you know, but I didn't, I didn't hear a lot of people turning over business. And I didn't really hear people, I know people are successful on these platforms. Nothing to take away from them either. I just didn't hear anybody like driving primary business. Like I didn't hear people saying, man, I've done a hundred deals from Instagram. I've done 50 deals from Facebook. I've done 75 deals from TikTok. I just wasn't hearing that. I know people generate business, but it was more like supplementing their their primary business. A lot of agents that have been in the business for five, 10 or 15 years. And so they have marketing plans. They have a sphere of influence. They have referrals coming in. So the social media, yeah, they do in 10, 20, 30 deals, but not where I really wanted to be. And over my, you know, career, I've been in three major industries. And I've always been successful from the start. Because again, I followed my simple model success, which was who's at the top? How did they get there? What are they doing? Can I model it? Can I adjust it to fit my personality? And can I do better than them? And so every time I did something else or made a transition, that's what I did. And so I thought, well, who can I, who can I do that in, in real estate? You know, but I didn't really want to be on TikTok or Instagram or Facebook either. I have not really been on social media that much because I'm at, I was at that 41 year old age range. And if you're like me and you're at that 40 age range and above, you probably have a love hate relationship with social media. I am, I am with you. And yes. Yeah. So, you know, we didn't grow up with it. It wasn't there in high school. It wasn't there in college. Came around in our late 20s, early 30s. We felt like it's just people bragging, posting cat videos and talking about their lunch. And here's my, yeah, it was my dinner. Yeah. And we're like, okay, that's stupid. But then, but then we started to see the 20 and 30 year olds make some money and we're going, okay, well, maybe there's something to this social media thing. But then, you know, nobody ever really digs into it. And so I knew going in, I was like, well, I also knew I wanted to pick one platform because the last thing I wanted to do was do what everybody was telling me to do is, well, you got to be on five different platforms. Well, I just think if you start out that way, you're going to put a 20% effort into five different platforms and you'll never truly master one and you'll never truly generate business from any of them because you're dabbling in all of them. And they're also different. Yeah. Extremely different. And so I thought, well, I want to choose one platform because I want to go all in on one platform. I want to focus on that platform. And then if I can build some business or something from that platform, it'll be much easier to branch out to the other ones than it is to try to cover all five at once. So I just started doing research and started looking into, you know, Facebook Instagram and TikTok first because that's what everybody told me to do. And when I studied that more and got deeper in those rabbit holes, I realized I really don't like those platforms for me. Nothing I was really interested in. I didn't see anything there as far as a path that fit my personality. So I started to, so then I started to think, well, I don't know, YouTube, actually what I did was I stopped and I started to look at people at our brokerage. Like you mentioned, go go, Michael Reese, there's another guy named Kyle Handy, Ricky Karuth, a couple of these people I started looking at and they were some of the top agents in an eXp. And so what I looked at them, I started to say, what's their commonality? And what I what I saw was, well, they've got a pretty strong YouTube presence, you know, not really in building a real estate business, but they had a YouTube business, you know, are they a YouTube, they're talking to other agents, attracting agents, things like that. So I thought, well, and what did I do? I looked at all their YouTube channels and they were talking about their time in production, right? You know, Ricky's known for like being one of the best cold callers, you know, Kyle's known for being really good at SEO and blog writing and doing open houses and go go has her, you know, social media boot camp and then, you know, Michael does his, you know, different funnels, you know, so, but they talked about their business, how they generated that and they're doing it on YouTube. And so I thought, well, that's kind of interesting. What if I just did that for real estate clients, you know, um, started to find out and I started to do research on YouTube and what I soon found out was that YouTube is a search engine, not a social media platform. Right. In fact, I think it's the number two search engine online, I believe at least in this country. Yeah. Yeah, it's number two behind Google. So I started to see that that YouTube was a search engine, and whenever I realized, oh, it's a search engine. And wondered if people are searching, you know, suburbs of Dallas. And so I started to look at, okay, Plano, Texas, for example, went on to Google on Google, Plano gets about 90,500 searches per month, not bad at all. But whenever you find that search volume on YouTube, it's 834,000 searches per month. It's 10 times search volume on YouTube than it is on Google. So that immediately told me that while people are searching 10 times the amount on YouTube over Google, they want to see these places. And then it made me realize, well, you know what? I think the reason those other platforms didn't resonate with me is because what I saw was a bunch of seasoned agents that have been in the business 5, 10, 15 years telling their telling stories about their experiences and their clients and how to do this on a home and how to watch out for this and look out for this and look out for that. And I hadn't even sold a home yet. So I was thinking, okay, well, I could, I could read about a VA loan and then regurgitate that on 60 second video on TikTok. But it just didn't seem authentic to me. It didn't seem right. It didn't really, I just thought, and I don't want to be that guy. Start edge. Yeah, it doesn't provide any particularly new value. It's not a terrible idea. But maybe there's a better idea, which is what you're headed to. Yeah. So yeah. So just as I dug into YouTube a little bit more than what I realized was, okay, well, if people are searching information about, you know, Dallas, Texas and Plano, Texas and Frisco, Texas and all the suburbs, well, I know everything about Dallas or mostly everything about Dallas. Maybe I can just talk about Dallas, not even have to talk about real estate in general or talk about contracts and escrow and title and the different types of loans. What if I just talk about the suburbs? And so that's where I started to really dig in and build out a plan. I built out a business plan. And this is something I think nobody does whenever they start on social platforms is treating YouTube like a business. And what I love to say now is that if you treat YouTube like a hobby, it'll pay you like a hobby. And if you treat YouTube like a business, it'll pay you like a business. And so what I did was I just started to research every possible thing I could on YouTube and YouTube marketing and videos and how to make videos and then, you know, look at all these different real estate channels. And then I just started to build out a plan of what I thought may do well as far as what people are searching. And then I had the search volume that helped me as well. So it wasn't me just guessing on, oh, maybe should I make this video? It was no. I could actually go in and see what were people searching on. Yeah, you know, you know, you know your potential audience size before you ever start recording because you have an idea of what that search volume traffic could be. And then of course, you have people you're competing within that space too, which you also, I imagine, did research on. Yep. Well, the thing was there wasn't really a lot in Dallas surprisingly. And that's the thing is is whenever I talk about, yeah, looking for a gap, there was, there was about five agents maybe, five agents that I found in Dallas that were mostly consistent. And one of them, the top channel had 7,000 subscribers. The second to top had 5,000 subscribers. Oh. And the next one had four, and the next one had three. Right. I was starting at zero. And I thought, okay, well, the top one has 7,000. So that's the, that's my person, right? That's the goal. That's the benchmark. Yeah. But yeah, we passed everybody up about six months ago. So and we should let people know sort of when we're talking about, you know, doing research, I'm going to throw a few ideas you tell me if these are, you know, worthy. And again, you're basing these based on search volume. So you're taking a look, you're doing the research. And so we're saying, okay, what kind of content are we talking about? So let's say somebody's moving to Plano. You could do a video on if there's enough traffic, best schools in Plano, or reasons to move to Plano, or here's the nightlife in Plano, or here's the, here are the neighborhoods that, you know, are most whatever, you know, it could be anything. Here's, here's the best restaurants in what Plano, or it could be top 10 reasons to move. Or so I'm just throwing these out there. Are this, is this the kind of content that we're talking about? Yeah, all of those would not even real estate necessarily related, but just related to people wanting information about living in Plano. Yeah, they want to see it. I mean, anybody can go on Plano or go on an iBire platform and look at homes all day in Plano, but. Zillow doesn't weigh better than we'll ever do it, right? Yeah, but they, uh, Basilow doesn't show them the home across the street, the homeless, or the playground, the community center, the community pool, the HOA pool, you know, it doesn't show them that you put lay around the corner doesn't show you that stuff. So yeah, we can, we actually take them out neighborhoods and show them that. Uh, yeah, pros and cons video, people want to know what's the good and the bad of living in an area, pros video, you can talk about all the good things in your area, you can talk about all the bad things are actually our number one video is, you know, what we hate about Dallas. That's funny. Uh, you know, it's funny. I was thinking about this as you were talking, I apologized and are up you. And first, by the way, before I meant to say this about 20 minutes ago and I, and I escaped me, but thank you, of course, for your service because without the safety of, uh, of our citizens, um, you know, we, we can't do much of anything. And so I, I just, you know, you said it that very quickly and I just want to, you know, force pause and admire you for, for dedicating service to, uh, to our country to help all of us, um, stay safe. And so thank you for that. Um, and I also, uh, wanted to, to, you know, I was just thinking about this. I was in, uh, I went on a father's son trip to Ireland with my dad, I three or four years ago and my dad had already been a couple of times. And so he was pretty familiar with a lot of the, the, the little towns and, uh, and all the sites. But, um, we were trying a few cities that he had never been to. It was my first time there. And so we're driving across, you know, all over the country, which is what everyone does when they go to Ireland. And every single night, because we visit about two to three cities a day, the very, for, you're, you're so absolutely right about this because the, yes, I had the, you know, Rick Steves, uh, travel Ireland book that was in our car. Um, but we were driving a lot. And my dad doesn't like to read the car. I was driving and it's everything's backwards. So it takes a lot of concentration. I can't certainly look up things in the book while I'm driving stick shift, you know, these little tiny roads in Ireland, hoping I don't get killed, um, because I'm driving the wrong way. But what we would do the night before is we would literally just go to YouTube and say best things to do in X. And then what we would do is we would download the video and then we would play it in the car, you know, that next day on the way to those places. And that was the best possible education I got because you're right. The books are great. And they were helpful. Um, but they didn't really give me a sense of what it was like to go to some of these attractions in these events. Um, so we would download it and watch it or listen to it on the way, uh, to that place. And, and I think a lot of people do this when they go visit places they have it. They look go best things to do, right? And, um, so I mean, that in and of itself is a is, is kind of the blueprint for for what we're talking about is find things that people are already searching for and just create the best possible video for that topic. Is that, is that my understanding? Absolutely. I want to pause for a moment to talk about our episode sponsor are one of my favorite companies out there follow up boss.

It would sort of be like, oh, let's talk about this though. How so you're a guy who you're you didn't grow up wanting to be a broadcaster. You didn't want to be a streamer. You didn't want to be a personality online, necessarily. You just knew that you were modeling some of these some of these people that have come before you and trying to figure out a gap in the market. And you know, it was funny because you were talking about Brian Tracy. One of my favorite Brian Tracy quotes is something like, well, he says sales solve all problems. And we would just maybe refrain refrain that to leads solve all problems because they really do, right? I mean, this is a business of leads. And of course, it's a business of service and all of the other things too, but leads are what keep the engine running. And you know, leads can come from a lot of different sources. But you basically saw your idea was, I don't want to go out into the public that much. That's not really what I'm best at. You know, I'm not the guy on the billboard or you know, racing around all these different events, you know, I want to be the guy, you know, people are doing all this searching online. I want to be the guy they go to for that. And you know, when you started making videos, you talked about reading about it, learning production, how difficult was it for you to, did you, did you have a, I need these videos to look perfect? Or were you willing to, to experiment and try different methods? Because I know a lot of listeners are like, I don't know anything about video production. That's not what I do. So how complicated are your video shoots? Pretty basic. So I don't, I don't think I've ever, the only videos I've ever re-recorded or the ones that I didn't record audio or something like that and whenever I made it. But that's only been a couple of times. I think for me, it was, no, I wasn't seeking this out. To me, I, I am a, we'll do what it takes to get things done type of person. So really, the thing is, as I grew up in a pretty neutral environment, I would say that my parents, as much as I love them, they never encouraged me to do anything with my life. They were, they were just kind of like, really, their mindset was is the, the, the most thing I heard ever come from my mom was, we can't afford that. So we grew up with a very poor mentality, with the same, same thing as far as you're never going to go to college. I mean, literally, it wasn't, my parents weren't like, hey, let's figure out a way you can get to college. It was like, well, we didn't go to college, your two older brothers didn't go to college and you're not. That's not in your future. Yeah, because we're, we can't afford it. And that's all they, like, I don't even think they understood about scholarships to. Yeah, yeah, because they, they never said, Levi, get good grades, get a scholarship, you know, none of that. I mean, it was just, it was not in there, in their, in their window, you know, and so, yeah. So that was the thing is that, and they never, I remember, like in a second grade, I wanted to be an astronaut, but they never bought me a popular mechanics magazine or, you know, encourage that in any way there. And so I think I was always a little lost. And so I remember I met someone like Michael and he was like, hey, just sell some gym memberships with me. I was like, okay, cool, you know, and then seeing someone like Brian Tracey, who talked about, oh, if you read, I mean, whatever you want to do, you can go out there and read about it and learn it and apply it and take action. And I was like, oh, brilliant, you know, genius, okay, okay, I can do that. And, you know, and then I got deployed. Well, when I got deployed, I thought a lot about what I wanted to do whenever I came back. And really, I wanted to get into real estate investing, but I didn't, I just got a job selling cell phones. But I knew from learning from Michael, I was like, I want to be the best at selling cell phones. And so what did I do? Went to the best salesperson. Hey, what are you doing? How did you do that? How did you get there? Takes some little tips. And then I was like, how do I adjust it to fit my personality? How can I do better? And of course, I beat them at their own game and became the best. Well, from there, I got recruited to a pharmaceutical company. The first thing I did in the farm company was, as I said, who's the best salesperson, which you can see them at the top of the charts. And he happened to be living in Oklahoma. It's three hours from Dallas. I asked my manager, hey, can I do all my calls Monday through Thursday and can I go Friday? Can I go drive up to Oklahoma and spend the day with this top salesperson? And he was blown away. Nobody had ever asked him in the years and years and years he'd been amazing. Yeah. And so I got up, you know, and that salesperson was starting at like eight in the morning. So I had to get up, drive three hours to Oklahoma, meet him by 8 a.m. And then I spent the whole day with him and drove back. But that was the things I was willing to do to just to try to try to be the best. And it took it took within 12 months. I was I never got to number one, but I got to number four out of 160 sales reps nationwide. But I did that in less than 12 months. And that's amazing. Easy to do in the pharmaceutical world. Well, from there, I transitioned into financial services. Whenever I got licensed for that and got into that business, the first thing I did was went to the best person I knew and learned from them and then figured out how to do it better. And I blew past them their production. You know, like they told me their best production was 1.3 million the first year. And that's a lot whenever you're talking about just getting up, monthly accounts built up for teachers. Well, I did 1.5 the first my first year. And so, you know, when I was making that transition into real estate, that's why I was really scared to death because I had not heard, you know, you hear about all the failures more than you hear of the successes. Well, there's a lot more there's a lot more failures than successes in real estate. Oh, yeah. And and if you hit 100,000 in your first year in real estate, you're a major success. You are a super superstar. Yeah. So, but I was like, I'm not good with 100,000. And also, what I just saw people doing was the same traditional ways, right? And so that's what scared me to death because I was like, I still wanted to come in and be successful and just be the best at real estate. I was like, and that's what held me back for so long too, because I never had the desire to do it. And I thought, you know, if I do move into that, I want to do this as fast as possible. I don't know if that's possible. But, you know, could I get to 200 or 300,000? That's what I was really thinking. Could I get to two or three or 400,000 in my first year? Because then I would feel like I made an impact. I'm off to a good start. And that's and and by that time, if you can do that, you've clearly cracked some code, right? It's not just, hey, I got lucky because I grew up here and all my friends still live here. And they just happened to all need to buy a condo or sell a condo this year. This is a whole different thing that nobody locally had even done, right? So, yes, there's a YouTube channels with 7,000, which is very meager, really. I mean, it's not really if you're doing it, that could be enough to generate tons of tons of business. But I'm guessing those other channels probably weren't generating a ton of business. So you didn't even have a really amazing blueprint. You did have you do we're kind of placing a bet? Well, going back to your question as far as the thing what I understood was in my research was that what I realized was, here's why I was at the position I was at because over my career of sales, gym memberships, cell phones, pharmaceuticals, and retirement plans, it was always me. It was one-to-one selling. And so every time I stopped or when I transitioned from cell phones to pharmaceuticals, I had nothing to show except a bunch of trophies from selling cell phones. When I went from pharmaceuticals to financial services, I had all the trophies from pharmaceuticals, but nothing came with me. No, in my- And plus it's not it's not as scalable, right? Like you it was you. It was you that was that was making all these sales and there wasn't an avenue like YouTube for real estate because you couldn't reach as easily a vast number of prospects in those other, you know, surfaces. Yep. Yeah. So and they were and there were jobs, of course, you can't really scale your job. You know, but when I went into financial services, that was when in the first time I started my own business. And I could bring on other reps and expand and I did that I brought on a couple of people, but the thing is is that the margins were small that I you know I had to cut into their cut, you know, if I wanted to make the overrides. And so I would bring on a few people and I just never felt right to me. I just thought man nobody is is going to make a serious living because I know that I'm a rare breed as well. Right. I'm confident in my sales ability and I know I know I'm a good salesperson and I know I'm in the top 1% and I've proven that in in four different industries. And I know that not everybody's that good of a salesperson. So in the financial services, I was going to be very difficult to find somebody like me that could sell as well as me. But then Yeah, it's hard to duplicate you. Yeah, if they didn't do that, if they didn't do that, they weren't going to make a good living either. So it never set wealth me. So I never scaled that accordingly because that was more of a just a personal conflict with myself was I didn't feel like I could get somebody on full time that could you could you know earn a full time living. So so that's what those were the questions I asked myself over the summer because and that's what kept me from getting in the real estate is because I did not want to go into one to one selling again. I didn't want to be the one shaking hands kissing babies doing the transactions. And and so or making the calls because you know as soon as you hang up the phone, your lead generation stops. And so I wanted to build something that was scalable something that that I could you know, I wasn't the factor, you know, and so that way if a pandemic or illness or you know, economy or something like that took me out of the picture whether temporarily or permanent, I could still have a business running on the back end. So that's just all the questions that I had to ask myself. So that's the other part of why we's grown so quickly. Oh, and so going back to your original question as far as camera presence, it wasn't hard for me because what I learned what I realized was all video is its communication and cells at scale. And so I was like, well shoot, if I can make videos, I can have the conversation once with that camera, but now I'm giving the it's still once a one, but a hundred a thousand, ten, fifteen thousand people to see that conversation. And so this is what I tell agents now is like, you do this every day. If I went to your neighborhood right now to buy a home, you could take me around all day long, tell me everything I needed to know about that neighborhood, the schools, the fun things to do. You could tell me all of that, but when I leave, it's gone. It's done. The conversation is dead forever. It'll never be resurrected. So stop doing that. Have that exact conversation you'd have with me and have it on camera. And now you can tell thousands of people and give them the opportunity to see that. That's passive prospecting. That is doing the cells pitch once and letting something else do all the work for you. Everybody loves the idea of passive income, but what do you have to do? You have to do the work upfront and put a system, a process, in place so that it constantly works for you on the back end, right? Because no matter what anybody says passive income still takes a little bit of tweaks here and there, right? And you yeah, look at it. But all video is passive prospecting. It's the same concept. We're taking the time, energy and effort to make that video. But once I've done that, it's done and it's going to work, not just 24 seven, but in a compound effect of time because making video does not take time, it makes you time and not only does it make you time, it compounds time. So that is always prospecting. That's why I don't feel bad now about traveling, taking the days off, taking the weekends off, going to conferences, going on vacation because videos still get published and leads still come in no matter what I'm doing. It's yes, everything you've said is apps, you know, it's funny. This is how this is an embarrassing thing. I'll admit that really speaks to everything you just said. So I recruit REALTORS. So I'm a bit different because I'm not a producing agent. I recruit for our company. And I'm doing it the same way I've been doing it since 2010, which is we have, well, we have people that make calls and say, hey, would you like to talk about switching firms and then they set up an appointment? And then I schedule a 30 minute meeting and I do my pitch. And 95% of the conversation is me explaining everything that we offer because that's why people are scheduling the appointment. You know, I'll do five minutes of like, hey, tell me about you. What are you looking for? What's, you know, you're having problems that you're existing for blah, blah, blah. Find, make sure I know what they want. But then I got to present for 25 minutes because that's what they're there to hear. And I've been doing that the exact same way for, well, for 12 years now. And this whole time I'm going, why don't I have a video that does most of this? Like, maybe it doesn't do the full 25 minutes, but it does like 20 minutes of it. And prior to the meeting, I go, hey, you know, just to save you time, Mr. and Mrs. Prospect, I'd like you to watch this video because honestly, you know, you can learn most everything we do. And then I'm going to call you at the time that we have scheduled. And we're going to have a better conversation because now you'll know kind of what we offer. I can have sort of next level conversations with you and you can, you know, it'll just be better. I don't know why I haven't done that yet. And you just reminded me that what I'm doing isn't scalable. And it's no different, really, then, you know, somebody meeting with a buyer for the first time, which by the way, if you're doing that one to one, awesome, good. I'm not here to tell you that that's a bad idea. But what if you had a video with somebody, I mean, we're now we're sort of beginning into a different realm. But if we had a video that said, Hey, Mr. and Mrs. first time home buyer, before we meet in person, I'd like you to watch this 15 minute video. It'll help prepare for the meeting. But anyway, this will save time for the agent. So it, you know, YouTube. And again, I'm sorry. So that was just one. No, two, no, two thing. You guys, please, please, two very important things about that. Number one, I do the exact same thing. So what's your brokerage? It's called kale like the vegetable. Okay. So I'm, you know, I'm with the XP and we, you know, we do agent attraction. The thing is is that I've never explained the XP business model to anybody. If they book a partner call with me, what happens is as soon as they book that call, I have an automation that sends them the eXp explained video. Because, and I say in the message, Hey, by the way, since we're going to be chatting about eXp, it's best you watch this video about the brokerage model. So that you have all the context you need and can ask the right questions when we get on the call. And so instead of them asking me, okay, what's the split? What's the right, which is what I deal with all the time? Yeah. That, you know, you know, those are done. Yeah. You know, they're number one. Every time I get on a call now, what their number one question is? No. How does this work? How do I, how do I, how do I move, why side, how do I move over? Yeah. So it's, it's the logistics of it. That's what their question is about. Sure. And then, and then we just chit chat. We kind of like, oh, so, where'd you grow up? You know, and then we just kind of go back and forth. So that, that's done the heavy lifting for me. Now, to your other point on the real estate side, the video builds the relationship for you. See, the thing is that nobody hardly watches one video and calls us. They end up watching 5, 10, 15, 20 videos. So whenever they come to us, number one, the, the relationship is already there on their side. They already feel like they know, like, and trust us. Right. And they, when they call us, they've already made the decision that they want to work with us. And so, and they feel like they know you, because it will, and this, this is the thing that, that people don't realize, it actually builds, and it may be it's artificial in a sense, but it's irrelevant because it works. It builds a connection between you and the audience because you are speaking one to one, even though that video's reaching tens of thousands of people possibly, it is a one to one relationship each time somebody pushes play. Yep. Absolutely. So how often do they feel like they know you? They're like, it's, it's probably, I've talked to other YouTubers who say it's, it's kind of funny in a way because people will talk to me as if they're already my friend, because they're so used to watching my content. They're so hooked on my content. They're like, I got to work with this guy. And by the time you end up talking to them, I imagine, you're right. You're not, they, they, they know they at least know and like you and hopefully trust you by then. But they know they like you because they're calling you or they're contacting you or reaching out. And they know you know what you're talking about, because you've demonstrated that value through these videos. Yep. Yeah. And I mean, people, you know, get recognized around town. It's funny because I was in the, I was actually at the airport the other day in the TSA line. And somebody started tugging on my sleeve and I looked over and I didn't see anybody. And then I looked down and it was this like 85 year old four foot lady. And she's just looking up. Man, I was like, I said, hello. And she goes, she goes, are you the YouTube real estate guy? I loved your 10 things to hate about playing a video. Yeah. I said, yeah, as mean, she's like, I like love your videos. And then she just walked on by, you know, and that's, and it's funny. It's happened in in clothing stores and coffee shops and coming in and out of my office. It's like people are like, Hey, hey, you know, I was getting food the other day. And the guy standing next to me in line is sitting there staring at me. And I'm just like, Hey, and he goes, because don't you make YouTube videos? And I was like, yeah, yeah. And he's like, oh, cool. You know, and it's just funny. And so you are building that up. And it's around this whole, you know, that's the thing is, is right now, especially in this market, I believe the most visible agent's going to win. So now that doesn't mean you have to be on video. But if you're a postcard person, you should probably send more postcards. If you're an email person, you should probably send more emails. If you're a phone call person, you need to make more phone calls. You can be visible on the phone when you're actually having conversations with people. So if you're a caller, you need to call more people in this market. And so right now, I want to pause for a second, because I want to make a pretty strong point is that I think I think you'll agree with this. You talked about, you just talked about postcards, email, you know, phone calls. Those are all you reaching out to the customer. People don't like emails, right? And again, I'm just generalizing. Obviously, there's nothing wrong with sending emails. But generally speaking, we don't, we don't love unwanted emails or certainly too many of them. We don't want too many phone calls. We don't want too many postcards, I mean, postcards are pretty innocuous. But what you're doing is they're coming to you because they're searching for the content they want. There's no resistance at that point. There's no like, who's this guy calling me? It's, oh, this guy's providing me content. I found him. He didn't find me. So we call that, and actually we talk about that. That's, I believe that's the first chapter in passive prospecting is interruption versus intentional marketing. So what you just described as interruption marketing, it's what we've, we've been conditioned to be a part of and conduct as business people are whole lives. That's TV commercials, billboards, magazine ads, postcards, cold calling, door knocking, that is interrupting. They say right now we get exposed to eight to 10,000 ads per day. Okay. Incredible. Now we're not buying that many products, which, which means we're completely ignoring them. Right. So, but they're interrupting you. And this thing is that you could see a dog food commercial 10 times a day. Doesn't mean you're going to go buy dog food. Right. I don't care how many times you see Jake from State Farm, you're not going to go run out and buy insurance. But the second you have a kid and you need, you need a new life policy or you need to update it or you run out, let's say you run out of dog food, you do not need any marketing or advertising to convince you to go do that. You now have intention. And now, now you're on the hunt. Now you're out there looking and guess what? People are intentional about buying or selling real estate. But most real estate agents chase after everybody else saying that they're in the relationship business trying to build relationships when all they're doing is really interrupting people nonstop. So hopefully one day, when they're finally in the market, they'll actually think of them and buy or sell a home with them. And then they end up buying a home from Uncle Bob because he's over at their house, drinking beer on a Sunday afternoon. And you're like, I've been chasing you down for 18 months. And they're like, well, sorry, Uncle Bob is over at my house. And you know, I just listed with him. So intentional means people are intentional about buying and selling real estate. But what if you're the person that's in front of them, whenever they're there, they're now searching for that information. When people go to research on YouTube and they search Dallas, guess what? They're going to get hit with all of our videos because we pop up everywhere. They can't avoid us. And so now they, and then they just start watching the content. Guess what? It's immediate value add. We don't sell them on the fact that we're real estate agents. We don't, you know, tell them about here's the tips to sell your home. It's like here's all the information about Dallas, what they're actually searching for. And so we just become their agent by default because they end up consuming so much content that, that, you know, they just can't help themselves. And I'm like, well, I'm going to go call this guy. Yeah. Well, yes, yes. And again, you haven't created resistance because you're not pitching them directly. I mean, maybe at the end of the video's, oh, hey, by the way, if you know, there may be some of that and that's that's fine. But they already found you. You didn't find them. You didn't pitch them first. And, and that is, that is just beyond beyond huge. So tell us about passive prospecting.com. Yeah, it's our website. I mean, the main thing we're doing right there is directing people to sign up to be the first to know when we release the new book. So we have written the book passive prospecting. It's in, it's in process right now. The publisher that we're working with has told us probably a February timeframe as far as release. So right now, if you go to passive prospecting.com, you'll see on the homepage, you can just sign up. And so that way, we'll notify you as soon as the book releases, because we do want to create some, some emphasis and some push around whenever that launches. It's going to be awesome. But it's, it's 14 chapters. I mean, and so it's, it's a, it's a lot, it's a lot of information. And, and we tell you, we talk about all the principles in the first half of the book and the second half of the book is how to apply them and how to build your own channel. So it's really going to be, really, I think everything you need. Now, the thing is you'll be missing the visual component, which I think, you know, like, like we walk through people through a digital course when we help them learn YouTube, which they can see. And it's very easy. But the book, I mean, that, some people learn from reading and writing. And so we, we walk them through everything that they need to get through that. And so we just talk about that. And, and the cool thing is is we got the forward. The forward was written by Ryan Sirhand. Oh, wonderful. Well, that's, that's certainly some nice social proof to help, help, help sell some books. And yeah, I, I need to get, I need to see if I can get him on our show. We've, yeah, I just, I haven't over all the years. I need to. But yes, but that's amazing. Congratulations on that. He's not an easy get. We, we actually have had him booked a couple of times over the years. And then it did, it just fell through. So that is, that is really impressive. And I, again, I just want to wrap this up with you don't have to be, you know, you don't have to have a special hook. You don't have to be, you know, the, the, the, the TikTok dancing family. Although, if that's your hook, great. But what, all you, all you can, you know, all you really need to do is focus on your expertise, which is hyper local real estate. Think of the questions your, your clients ask you when they move in or move out. Think of the things they need, the thing, and then you can, you know, God, there's a million tools to look up search volume. Take a, and again, just the biggest mind shift change that I'm making in this, in this conversation is, YouTube is not a place to watch videos. It's a search engine. It's a search engine first that happens to show you videos. And if I think of it that way, then it becomes a research and development tool versus, and also, you know, you know, fun thing if I want to screw around on YouTube. But I can actually use it for research and development. Whereas Instagram, Facebook, and even TikTok, you're at the mercy of either the people you already know or in TikTok's, you know, case a little bit differently. You know, they, they have a sort of a different algorithm set. But, you know, Facebook is people, you know, for the most part, maybe some people find you here and there through referrals. Instagram's essentially the same way. So all you're really, and there's nothing wrong with creating content for your, your followers. But it's not easy to sort of branch outside of those followers in those platforms. It's really tough because that's just not what those platforms are for. Instagram tries to be a search engine. I don't think it does that all that successfully. But certainly YouTube has as the cream of the crop that's where everyone goes to learn how to do and how to do something or how or about something. You know, my, my, my dad was like, I, he just, you know, he goes around and fixes things all over the house. He checks everything on YouTube first, like, like a lot of us do. So I absolutely love this. And we all have essentially 4K phones with incredible resolution, incredible clarity. You don't even have to have necessarily really amazing equipment. What you do have to have is really amazing content, which is what you have, if you're a real estate agent who cares and actually works on their craft, you just take the information you already have and and apply it and make videos. Well, just real quickly, what's the, have you found to be an optimal length or or for your videos to for the, where the audience stays engaged or do you find it's kind of all over the board? Videos need to be as long as they need to be. So give the information that's needed to create the video. Don't keep talking just to keep talking. So if the videos 12 minutes and 19 seconds, let it be that if it's 15 minutes and 18 seconds, I mean, I've been, I've even done an hour video on, on the channel as an experiment. And it's one of the most viewed and most watched videos on the channel. So the thing is, is again, when your audience is researching, you, you have their attention because you know their intention. So when you know their intention, you will have their attention. And so a longer form video, that's what they're there for. And that's what gets people dialed in and builds that relationship for you because they watch more and more content the longer they watch it, the more of the relationship they develop and deepen with you. So, so yeah, I mean, the shortest maybe 10 minutes, the longest I've done an hour and everything in between. So I, I make videos and the thing is I didn't intentionally make an hour video, but I knew it was going to be a lot because I was going to cover a lot. And at the end of it, it was like, Oh, that's an hour. So, you know, it is what it is. And I thought, well, we'll see what happens. But again, still one of the most popular, one of the most viewed videos. So it just told me that, okay, people are, are dialed in when they're researching. I mean, making a move is a big decision for a lot of people and people do research that. But think about how do they actually research that from before? I mean, we've also helped people move from Japan, from Belgium, from the Philippines, from Australia, from the UK, from South Africa. Where would else would they have found us other than YouTube? I mean, do you think those people would have just randomly discovered our website or our Facebook profile? No, no, they're going to search Dallas first because they're moving here because of a job, because of a better opportunity, because of a transfer of this or that, you know, and so they're saying, well, what's Dallas like? Let's go on YouTube and take a look. Let's see what Dallas looks like. And then guess what? All of our videos pop up over and over again. And so they're like, hey, moving from Belgium, you know, which we just got that email two weeks ago. And that's what the lady said, used to live in Florida, lived in Belgium the last six years. Now we're getting transfer to Dallas. So so again, in essentially one year, we're talking 164 transactions, 90 million in production, almost three million in commissions. These results speak for themselves. I don't need to say anything other than I want to read that book. So the best place and by the way, everybody needs to read this book because even if you're not a YouTuber, even if you're not somebody that thinks this is a viable path, I am guessing that with the rates have, you know, essentially doubled since since and I don't like to even say rates have doubled because they were such low. Of course, they were going to double, but regardless, it's still a tricky time to generate leads. So if you're doing the traditional methods, then you know, you're going to just have a lot of people sitting on the sidelines. There's only a certain percentage of your sphere of influence that are going to be buying or selling in the next 12 months. And you're probably a little stressed about it right now. I know all of our agents are this provides you even if you're like, that's not really what I'm not really a online personality. It doesn't you don't need to necessarily be an online personality. What you need to do, I mean, I don't care who does. I watched the video last night. I had to replace a a switch. I have like a smart switch light switch essentially and it has a dimmer and whatever. So anyway, I had to switch it and I was like, I better just double check that I've got these wires, you know, connected correctly. Or I'm going to blow up my whole home. And I watched a one-minute video. It was a guy who was not a YouTube personality, but he had the most views for this particular so you know, wiring for outlet. It had like three million views and this it was a one-minute video. This guy could not have been less personable. And yet his content was good and it was quick and it works. And so even if you're not somebody who's like, oh, I'm not as dynamic, maybe I'm more introverted, it doesn't matter. You just have to have that incredible content. And yes, you should learn how to make things look good and sound good and you should be really intentional about, you know, the way you're speaking. And there's a lot to learn. But regardless, I just watched a video last night. This guy basically saved my life. And he is not dynamic. So I just want to make that point that if you're thinking about, you know, another way to generate income because like, like Levi was saying, you can create a really great piece of content. It might generate traffic for a very long time or even forever, I guess, and you know, could be. And so you have this opportunity to create something that lasts. Social media is very digestible. It's very, it's very transient. It comes and goes. We do the infinite scroll. But YouTube stuff kind of lasts forever. Now something better might come along and replace you. And then you can create another video to replace that person, you know, so, you know, that can happen. But essentially, if it's good, it lasts. And I see this all the time, like this video about replacing the electrical wiring. He made it like 10 years ago. And it's still the best video, 10 years. And you would think some electrician has got a better personality is more dynamic can make it. I mean, this guy literally was literally, it was just his webcam. He was holding it up. There was no production. And 10, you know, like 10 million views or something. So anyway, let's, let's all visit passive prospecting.com.
