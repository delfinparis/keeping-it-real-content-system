[00:01:14] Today's episode is brought to you by corded.io.
[00:01:18] Are you looking for agents to join your brokerage or team?
[00:01:21] Now, as a real estate recruiter, I can tell you the answer is always yes.
[00:01:26] But most agents aren't looking to move right now.
[00:01:29] So how do you know who to contact?
[00:01:31] Well, what if I were to tell you there's a recruiting and retention tool powered by artificial intelligence
[00:01:36] that shows you exactly which agents in your local market are looking to leave their brokerage right now
[00:01:42] and which agents at your own firm are also looking to leave you?
[00:01:46] Now, I've been recruiting REALTORS for 15 years and I've hired over 2000 agents.
[00:01:52] I can tell you with no exaggeration, this is the tool I've been waiting for.
[00:01:56] Corded's AI looks for trends across dozens of variables for each agent in your market
[00:02:01] and shows you which agents they believe are likely to move.
[00:02:04] Not only does it do that, but corded's AI went and visited my recruiting website
[00:02:09] and read everything I offer.
[00:02:11] So now when I'm recruiting, corded's AI tells me exactly what to say
[00:02:15] based on that agent's needs and what my brokerage can offer.
[00:02:19] It even writes emails for me.
[00:02:21] I've never seen anything like it and I use it every single day.
[00:02:25] Now, if you are looking to grow your brokerage, corded.io is the best tool out there.

[00:02:50] Hey, welcome to Keeping It Real, the largest podcast made by real estate agents and for real estate agents.
[00:02:56] My name is DJ Paris.
[00:02:58] I'm your guide and host through the show.
[00:03:00] I'm very excited about today's episode because we're having a guest that we used to have on all the time
[00:03:06] and then they're back and we couldn't be more excited to talk to Zillow.
[00:03:13] Amanda Pendleton, specifically from Zillow, about all of the cool stuff that they know that agents maybe don't yet know
[00:03:20] and we're going to help guide you through some of that information so you can be more effective with your clients.
[00:03:25] Let me tell you more about Amanda.
[00:03:27] Amanda Pendleton is Zillow's house trends expert.
[00:03:29] Her practical data-driven advice on real estate, renovations and design has been featured.
[00:03:36] Listen, this is truly amazing on the today show on CBS Sunday morning, New York Times, real simple and on glamour.
[00:03:45] Amanda translates Zillow's housing market data into actionable advice for homeowners, buyers, sellers and renters.
[00:03:52] She directs research that helps people make smarter decisions about where and how they live.
[00:03:57] From the color they should paint their bathroom walls to the features that could increase their homes value.
[00:04:03] Amanda, by the way, is also an Emmy award-winning storyteller and former television personality who spent more than 15 years as a major market news anchor.
[00:04:12] She is passionate about renovating and restoring historic homes with design projects published in apartment therapy, Seattle magazine and Boston home magazine.
[00:04:23] Amanda, welcome to keeping it real.
[00:04:25] That was great to be here. Thanks, DJ.
[00:04:27] I am super excited to talk to you and I really believe that probably nobody has more information on home buyers and sellers than Zillow.
[00:04:41] I remember I was at an event, a Zillow event years ago, and this was just one of the sort of throwaway data points that was mentioned.
[00:04:48] It was brilliant that I wouldn't have known where they were saying, are data scientists have all this information that you probably just wouldn't think of?
[00:04:57] For example, if you show white linens on your bed or white bed spread, it has a 30% higher engagement rate.
[00:05:09] I was like, that's amazing. If I have an agent and I am doing photos for a list, I would probably keep a white duvet in my trunk.
[00:05:18] That's something I would never know. I love the fact that you guys know things like this and you don't just know things like that.
[00:05:25] It's amazing that there is this information and it can really help agents be more effective.
[00:05:32] 100% I think a lot of people don't know that Zillow has data scientists, an economist, an population scientist, a behavioral scientist.
[00:05:39] What's great about my job is that I get to work with all of them, which is exciting if you're a huge data nerd, which I am.
[00:05:48] What's also neat is that Zillow conducts the largest most comprehensive survey of more than 60,000 buyer sellers, renters and prospective buyers every single year.
[00:06:00] This is the largest private survey of its kind. The reason that we do this is because we know economic data is great.
[00:06:08] We love that. We got plenty of that.
[00:06:11] Here's the thing. DJ, you know this, your listeners know this. Buyers and sellers are not rational.
[00:06:19] They often act in ways that the economic models probably wouldn't predict them to act.
[00:06:26] This survey data really helps us better understand the market. What makes buyers and sellers tick?
[00:06:33] It informs a lot of our business decisions at Zillow and we freely share it with agents because we want to help them build and grow their businesses too.
[00:06:43] I think that is absolutely right on and really excited to have you here. Let's dive right into it.
[00:06:50] I know we wanted to talk about buyer loyalty. Let's talk about it.
[00:06:56] So what really stood out in our survey data this year is a number of things in terms of buyer loyalty.
[00:07:06] The first thing is that you know, repeat buyers are number one back in the market. They now represent 55% of all buyers, which is a majority.
[00:07:14] And that wasn't the case about a year and a half ago.
[00:07:17] These are homeowners who had been sitting on the sidelines for the past several years. They were waiting for rates to fall.
[00:07:24] They've gone through the five stages of grief, mourning the loss of that 3% mortgage, right?
[00:07:30] They've accepted, okay, those rates aren't coming back. They're finally listing their homes for sale at the highest rates we've seen since 2019.
[00:07:38] And a lot of them need somewhere to go. So repeat buyers are back in the market, but they're coming back different.
[00:07:44] They're not necessarily running back to their former agent who helped them the first time around.
[00:07:52] Yeah, that's interesting. I know the National Association of REALTORS shows every so many years they do this survey.
[00:07:59] And it's like 74% of home buyers and sellers would say they would use their agent again that they used previously.
[00:08:07] However, only like 14% actually do. So this is really a wonderful reminder to our agents that people forget about you.
[00:08:16] And here's some ways not to obviously have them forget about you.
[00:08:22] Yeah, and we actually have similar data and I'll walk you through it if you just bear with me here.
[00:08:27] When we asked recent buyers, so people who just bought their home, they just got their keys, they were just moving into their new house, would you work with the same agent to get in the future?
[00:08:39] 79% of them said, yes, absolutely. We loved our agent. Of course we'd work with them again.
[00:08:45] Well, then what happens time, time goes by and our data shows that it's usually 14 years. That's usually how long homeowners are in their homes before they sell again.
[00:08:55] So 14 years go by and only 13% of repeat or recent, yeah, repeat buyers say that they would hire the same or that they found their agent through past experience.
[00:09:07] Right. So that's a huge gap. 79% of people said, yes, of course I'd hire my agent again. 13% actually do.
[00:09:15] And there's a lot of reasons to explain that gap away, right. Maybe they move to a different city or neighborhood. Of course they need a different agent.
[00:09:24] Maybe their former agent retired or got out of the industry. You know, maybe it's been 14 years and they just forgot who they used the first time around, right.
[00:09:33] But it doesn't explain away every single buyer. There's still a significant share of repeat buyers who are simply deciding that another agent is going to be a better fit for their needs.
[00:09:47] And this is not a reflection on an agent's performance, right. Even if your client had a wonderful experience with you, their lives have changed.
[00:09:56] Maybe you helped them get into a condo in the city. And now they're looking for a four bedroom in the suburbs, right.
[00:10:03] They're looking for something different in their home and maybe something different in their agent.
[00:10:08] Yeah, I think that's absolutely right. And I think it also highlights the gap between or an opportunity rather that agents really need to consider, which is the old adage out of sight, out of mind, right.
[00:10:22] We love to think that people remember us that we're so important to them. And we had such a wonderful experience that 14 years later, of course they're going to give us a call.
[00:10:32] But if we're not continually priming that pomp, if we're not reaching out, if we're not proving to them over those next 14 years that we still care about them, we still are interested in their lives.
[00:10:43] We are checking in. We are asking them what's going on in their lives so that we know about these life events that may precipitate a move.
[00:10:51] They are going to look elsewhere because we know for sure they're going on Zillow, right. And they are going to go on Zillow and they're going to look for homes on their own. They do not need an agent to do that.
[00:11:01] And they might just say, you know what, let's see what other agents are out there.
[00:11:06] Yeah, I think, you know, for an agent, this really means loyalty cannot be assumed, right.
[00:11:13] Repay buyers are shopping around. In fact, we know that nearly half of repeat buyers, 46% spoke to two or more agents before they made their choice.
[00:11:22] So even if they are calling you, they may be calling someone else as well. And I think, you know, you hit on it, right. Agents need reengagement strategies.
[00:11:31] We know there's a lot that work as long as they are authentic. And I'm sure your listeners are really well versed in all these things.
[00:11:39] But, you know, we're talking about that regular market update email, right. That's tailored to their neighborhood.
[00:11:45] We're talking about checking in on those milestones. Maybe it's been a year since their purchase or their birthdays coming up.
[00:11:51] It's staying digitally visible, right. Maintaining that active social media presence, keeping all your online profiles updated.
[00:11:59] But I think most importantly, these communications have to feel authentic and they also have to add value, right.
[00:12:07] You just check in for the sake of checking in, right.
[00:12:10] Can you provide some helpful resources, you know, maybe it's a phone call that's, hey, I know you were thinking about making that that kitchen renovation or getting started on that construction project.
[00:12:20] But my other client just had a great experience for their contractor. I would be happy to connect you.
[00:12:26] Can I send along an email, something like that, right. You're adding value to that conversation.
[00:12:31] That's what really keeps you top of mind as a trusted advisor and not just, you know, as a pest.
[00:12:38] One of my favorite people in this business is a local agent here and she, her name is Amy, she's a Compass agent.
[00:12:46] And what she's been top 1% producer for, I don't know, 15 plus years.
[00:12:50] And I asked her, I said, what do you do every day? Because I'm always curious. I don't produce myself. So I'm always curious what top agents actually do day to day.
[00:12:58] And I expected her to give a state or dancer, which a lot of agents give, which is like, ah, my days are always really different.
[00:13:04] There's so much happening. It really, I can't give you a similar day. She said, I actually have kind of the same day every day.
[00:13:10] And or at least half of my day is the same. And she said, from eight until noon, or maybe it was nine until noon, she goes, I literally go to my phone.
[00:13:18] I go to my contact list, which all my clients and my sphere is in there. And I just start dialing.
[00:13:23] What's interesting is she says, I have about five or six reasons I might call somebody.
[00:13:29] But the one that is the most successful is kind of what you touched on, which is she said, hey, just checking in, I was curious.
[00:13:38] Do you have any home projects that you either not finished or not started? Right? Because everybody's, I just moved into this place.
[00:13:45] And we have a ton of projects that we've started and we have a ton more that we need to do. And so everybody's got that who, you know, has a has a home.
[00:13:54] So it's a brilliant question because the answer is always yes. And then she says, well, tell me about it. What's the project? And then they'll tell them.
[00:14:01] And she's, they'll tell her and she'll say, great, give me a few minutes. If she might know somebody right off the spot who can fix it or help start the project or finish it.
[00:14:09] Or she'll say, give me a day or two on this. I want to go to my database. I know the best people that can work on this. I'll get back to you.
[00:14:17] And again, it's like that's brilliant because it's maybe just the push that person needs number one to get the project completed.
[00:14:23] But it's a really helpful resource. So I love that strategy. I think that's brilliant.
[00:14:27] Right. Yeah. No, and you know, I've heard stories too about agents saying, you know, they'll call up a client and say, hey, I just drove by, you know, Dan's donuts.
[00:14:36] I thought of you. I know it's your favorite place. Right. Maybe they didn't drive by Dan's donuts. But, you know, it's reminding the client. I'm thinking about you.
[00:14:45] I remember you, your top of mind, you know, little things like that, making it personal, making it authentic. I think that's what works.
[00:14:54] Yeah, it's the one thing I cannot do yet. And maybe hope for a number, but certainly not yet. It cannot replace the I was driving by Dan's donuts. And I know that's your favorite place. And I'm thinking about you.
[00:15:07] And by the way, how are the kids doing and, you know, all the interpersonal stuff that is really ultimately most important because it speaks to intimacy. It speaks to care.
[00:15:19] Like I care about you. I actually think about you. And it's funny because we're not necessarily talking about real estate.
[00:15:27] Another reason to call somebody, which is also something you mentioned, is to give an updated, uh, CMA or in the Zillow terms, as estimate, right.
[00:15:36] Like everybody is looking up their's estimate, you know, whether agents believe that or not, they are. Everybody knows their's estimate, or at least they're looking it up occasionally.
[00:15:44] What I would do if I were a practicing agent, and I would call and say, oh my gosh, I was just checking out your estimate. Zillow thinks your home is worth like X, you know, whatever.
[00:15:54] I actually want to also run my own personal analysis just to see if I, if it matches up, because I really know this market really well. And I'm curious if, if our data matches up, I'm going to go ahead and do that for you to send that over to you.
[00:16:05] Right. Like another great reason to reach out. The estimate, I think, is one of the best ways to reconnect with people because everybody's looking at it.
[00:16:13] Yeah, no 100% agree. I love that strategy. And I think also just, you know, reaching out with reassurance, people read headlines, right.
[00:16:22] They're seeing a national story, a national market that may be very different from what's happening in their particular neighborhood.
[00:16:29] And an agent as that trusted expert can say, hey, you may be seeing this, but here's what's really happening in your neighborhood, you know, we're seeing home sell 10 days faster than the national average or whatever it is, right.
[00:16:43] So some kind of reassurance that like your home value is still strong. We still think that we're going to be able to sell your home if you're interested in that. And we can help you get into a new one.
[00:16:52] Yeah, it's funny. I'm just thinking about this. You know, who doesn't call me with things like that, my accountant, my financial advisor, my, who else, my attorneys, like, I really don't get my insurance agent.
[00:17:06] I don't, and again, I love all these people. Like, I'm in no way speaking pejorative to them. I really, truly, I have a great team.
[00:17:14] But they're not really doing that. Maybe they don't have to. And I'm not suggesting that they should, but real estate agents have this opportunity that other service professionals don't.
[00:17:22] And it really, like, it would be kind of weird if my accountant called me just to see how I was doing, even though I really like her. I don't, you know, we don't have that kind of relationship.
[00:17:31] But real estate agents do. And I think that's a really important thing is to bring that interpersonal part back and add value.
[00:17:40] Let's talk about online research. You guys are the king of online research.
[00:17:45] Yeah, I think in the past, finding an agent was really all about who you knew referrals were king. And those referrals from friends and family members are still really important today.
[00:17:57] But our data is showing that times are changing. And today an increasing number of buyers are finding their agent online. And I can do a comparison for you.
[00:18:08] You know, if we look at referrals, right, about one in five buyers and sellers say they were relying referrals from family members and friends to find an agent.
[00:18:17] We've seen that share fall over the past seven years. Now at the same time, more than a third of buyers and sellers now say they found their agent online.
[00:18:27] So that could be a real estate portal. It could be a search engine. It could be social media. And that share has doubled in the past seven years.
[00:18:36] So this is not just a fleeting trend. This is a fundamental shift in how agent relationships begin. And the hiring decision is happening before that first conversation.
[00:18:49] Agents who understand this are kind of in a better position to win.
[00:18:54] Yeah, so what would you suggest an agent might do to beef up or make sure that their online presence is what they would want. Because you're right.
[00:19:08] Even if it's, I mean, maybe if it's not your best friend, but if it's a friend of your best friend who's referred to you, they're still going to Google you. They're still going to look up your reviews. They're going to look up your Zilla reviews. They're going to look up your Google reviews. They are also going to see what comes up when they type in your name.
[00:19:23] Just like, you know, would be on a first date. People do that as well. And so what might what is what is Zilla suggest that agents, you know, should do to make sure that when they are people are researching you that they ultimately, you know, find good stuff.
[00:19:39] Yes, your online presence is your 24 seven storefront, right. It's your digital storefront. So here's some things you got to be thinking about. I think number one first impressions are really happening on social media now.
[00:19:52] Our data shows that nearly half of prospective buyers, 44% of prospective buyers say they're more willing to hire an agent who's got a social media presence.
[00:20:02] The second thing, your client reviews, your past sales, your bio, it's got to be everywhere online.
[00:20:10] And it's because buyers and sellers aren't just googling you. Now they're using, you know, Gemini and chat GPT. So you need to be findable.
[00:20:20] And you need to have all that stuff get pulled into those AI generated searches.
[00:20:25] And then the third thing I think is to demonstrate your value clearly online, right. You want to show your process. You want to show your market knowledge. You want to demonstrate your results, right.
[00:20:35] I think you just don't want to leave someone guessing what the experience is going to be like working with you. You want to make that very clear up front.
[00:20:43] Yeah, I think that's right. And a lot of agents really sort of ignore that and just assume the referral sort of game is enough, right. Like my clients will tell it. And yes, that does work. And it does obviously drive leads.
[00:20:58] But if you don't have this online presence to supplement or to compliment that, it's really hard for somebody who hasn't ever met you to feel comfortable or maybe you have an Instagram channel or a YouTube channel that also goes a little deeper into sort of who you are and what you're all about.
[00:21:16] And that can obviously supplement that too. But I think having a good looking website is critical. I don't think you need the home search portal on your site. A lot of agents have, you know, there's a lot of debate about whether that's important.
[00:21:29] And still has already got that covered. You don't really have to do that. People don't need your site for that. But what they do need your site for. And again, I'm not picking on anyone that has that. We have it on our sites as for our agents as well. We actually think it's cool. But what people really want to see when they go to your site is tell me your story. Who are you. What are you all about. Why should I hire you.
[00:21:47] You know, give me the warm and fuzzies and show me competence. And let me, you know, obviously make the decision that way. But be absolutely right. It's funny. I get referrals from. So we have at our company. We have about 700 agents. And we get referrals from those agents. Thankfully, we're so fortunate. Our agents like us and they say, I tell other agents, oh, you should talk to DJ.
[00:22:08] And you would think that those are just easy slam dunks. And sometimes they are. But oftentimes they're like, oh, yeah, I want on your website and I read everything about you guys. It's like, oh, yeah, of course you did. I would do the same thing. So, of course, that's super important. And this is the time. This is the year to just make sure because again, with AI searching being more and more prevalent. I think I think the days of Google searching is coming to an end. I really do. I think in five years, we will not be searching that way. We will just be talking into our phones.
[00:22:37] I mean, we pretty much are doing that now anyway, but it'll be much more seamless. And AI knows how to search much faster than a human can search. And it can hit a lot more search results. So you want to make sure that your content is super valuable, not only to, to users, but also to AI.
[00:22:54] And so learn about what AI looks for in content and create that content. And also AI knows great videos too. So it can actually recommend you when people are searching not for you, but just for standard content. So yeah, I think I think that's a great, great sort of series of suggestions. And always something to to keep in mind.
[00:23:16] I want to talk about Gen Z because this is confusing to me. It's not confusing to me. I think it's somewhat unfortunate that they're in. Look, we know it's it is not tough. The middle class, it is tough being in the middle class right now. It's tough being Gen Z. The purchase power isn't quite what some of the previous generations had. And that's unfortunate. And it is a bummer.
[00:23:38] What we do know for sure is that the average first time home buyer age is going up and it's going up significantly. And it's a real shame because I don't necessarily think it's an unavoidable thing. I think a lot of younger generations, especially Gen Z, maybe just don't understand the ability that you have to actually accumulate wealth throughout your lifetime with your house. And if you start buying your home later, you lose out on a lot of things.
[00:24:08] And that's one of that opportunity. So yeah, tell us about what what is Gen Z up to? Are they renting? Are they buying? And what do they want from an agent?
[00:24:17] Yeah, what I think was surprising in our data is that we found Gen Z is playing a much bigger part in the market than we kind of anticipated, I think. And that a lot of people think you think about Gen Z is, you know, they're snapping selfies. They're making a tick-tock dances. They're not buying homes.
[00:24:32] Well, it turns out they are. They make up 20% of US adults now. They make up 18% of home buyers, 14% of home sellers. And as they age, that share is just going to go up.
[00:24:46] The oldest Gen Z right now is 30 years old. That kind of blew my mind and made me feel really old.
[00:24:55] But something else that might surprise you is that Gen Z is making 50% more income than baby boomers were at their age.
[00:25:04] And they have access to the bank of mom and dad, right? 46% of Gen Z buyers are getting a gift or a loan from a family member or a friend to buy a home compared to 35% of all buyers.
[00:25:17] So they're getting some help. It's not all smooth sailing. You touched on it. Affordability, huge deal. This generation is the most likely to be denied a mortgage.
[00:25:27] A third of all Gen Z buyers are initially denied a mortgage. But then they persist, right, until they do secure that loan.
[00:25:36] I think that's something huge about this generation. They're really scrappy and they're really resilient. And they still believe in this American dream of home ownership.
[00:25:46] Yeah, I think that's that is exciting. I'm glad that those those numbers are changing because we're seeing the first time home buyer age is now like 39 and it's like it should not be that because again, you're just going to be missing out on appreciation.
[00:26:01] It's not. And what's so wonderful to hear is that yes, we know that as as boomers are retiring, baby boomers retiring, that largest, you know, there's going to be this gigantic wealth transfer for even the generation prior to that.
[00:26:15] It's going to be passing that into boom the boomer generation and that's going to be passing down into like the millennials and Gen Zs.
[00:26:21] And that's where a lot of these down payments come from. And I could not agree with you more. My sister and I were both fortunate enough to be able to get our first places due to our parents being saving.
[00:26:33] And we wouldn't have been able to do it otherwise. And not everybody gets that that luxury. But more people are getting that opportunity.
[00:26:40] So I think that's a great sort of opportunity for agents right now to consider having those conversations with Gen Z, even the ones that don't think they should be buying or maybe have a negative stigma attached to to what home buying or maybe I can't afford it.
[00:26:56] And you know, having those conversations about well, here's how it actually works. And let's talk about renting versus buying and let's sort of figure out, you know, what the opportunities are because I know for sure what went when I before I bought my first place, which is in 2005 somewhere around there.
[00:27:12] I didn't know that I could purchase like I just thought, oh, that's that's not for people like that's not for me. I don't have enough money. Well turns out I did, but I didn't know I did right or and my parents were able to help supplement that to make it happen.
[00:27:24] So as soon as I did some research on my own, nobody helped me that I was able to say, oh, I can do this, but I was too embarrassed to ask. So I think it's an opportunity for agents to really go to that younger generation and say, let's have a conversation about this.
[00:27:38] Like, you're probably closer than you think. So great, great, great opportunities there.
[00:27:45] And you know, we see it in on Zillow, right? We're looking at user behavior and Gen Z, they're really active dual shoppers. So they're looking at rentals on Zillow and they're looking on the first sale side too and they're kind of toggling back and forth and ultimately they're just trying to find the best deal.
[00:28:02] Right? So we have all these great tools right now, things like viability where you can go online, you plug in some personal financial information. It will show you exactly how much home you can actually afford.
[00:28:15] And you can do that. You get that number without having to pick up the phone and call a loan officer, which I think is a huge barrier for a lot of Gen Z perspective buyers.
[00:28:26] It's intimidating to call a loan officer if you've never talked to one because they are going to ask you a lot of questions that will likely make you squirm. I mean, I've been, I had many loans.
[00:28:37] Every time I have to do it, I squirm a little bit giving them all of my statements. It always feels a little bit like, you know, taking off my clothes in front of a stranger.
[00:28:46] And it is not always the greatest thing. So I love that you guys have tools that allow people to sort of at least slowly step into that that realm without feeling so intimidated because of course it can be.
[00:28:58] So I love that, you know, there are tools that just allow people to get more instant information.
[00:29:04] And Gen Z is interesting as well because they're not people that talk on the phone very often. Right? That's another way. So like the way they communicate is different.
[00:29:13] And yeah, they're doing the TikTok dances and, you know, they're scrolling social media, but they're texting a lot, right? That's probably their primary way of communication with other people and are personally, you know, when they're not face to face.
[00:29:27] And that's something that agents really have to sort of wrap their mind around is you really need to meet the client where they're at. And if you're a phone person and you call Gen Z people and you will find out real quickly if they're a phone person.
[00:29:41] And you have to adjust and it's not easy sometimes for like I grew up talking on the phone. I don't know if you did or not, but I didn't grow up texting. So it just I still do it.
[00:29:53] But it's not my I would rather pick up the phone most most of the time because I want to have longer form conversations. They like shorter form conversations. So communications learning that those styles are really important.
[00:30:06] Yeah, no, I it's sort of that running joke, right? That Gen Z is allergic to the phone, but what we're seeing increasingly across our data is that most buyers and sellers would prefer a text message than a phone call, right?
[00:30:19] I think 50% of buyers say that's their preferred method of communication now. Only a third of buyers say that a phone calls their preferred method of communication.
[00:30:28] I mean, obviously if you got something bigger to discuss a phone calls appropriate, but I think if a Gen Z client is texting you, you need to text back, right?
[00:30:37] Don't pick up the phone and call them. They're not going to answer. And then the other thing with Gen Z is that you want to sound like a human and not like a robot, a chatbot, right?
[00:30:48] They are all about authenticity. They can sniff out when someone's reading a script or someone's being fake with them, right? So I think it is sort of matching your communication style with theirs.
[00:31:01] And I love to that being a REALTOR is one of those professions that is unlike maybe a financial advisor or an accountant or an attorney to the, you know, obviously that you can express your own creativity and identity and personality in those professions too, but you're probably more limited.
[00:31:22] And those professions have a particular association with a style of dress or a style of conversation and REALTOR's kind of don't really have that.
[00:31:31] So it's fun when I have people on my show that really are being completely authentic and maybe that's not sort of even what, you know, is a mainstream form of like communication or style of dress or, and they can like really be themselves have an incredible career.
[00:31:50] So I love that with agents. It's probably the profession that you can make the most amount of money being authentically yourself to any probably any other.
[00:32:00] And so that's kind of a cool thing too, because you're right authenticity is everything. And it's what people want. And the cool part is you just get to be yourself.
[00:32:09] So it's like it's actually kind of a win all the way around if you're willing to show up as you are.
[00:32:16] Let's talk about sellers because sellers are the other half of the game. So what are sellers wanting right now? I just sold a property and I gave up that three percent mortgage and nobody was less happy to do it than me, but I was happy to do it because I'm getting married.
[00:32:31] And of course that makes perfect sense at a good reason to do it and I upsized. So I doubled my square footage. So I'm really grateful for that.
[00:32:40] But I also did double my market, my mortgage payment, which is not as much fun, but, but you know what? It was made sense. And the reason why I did it is because there were fewer homes on the market to sell.
[00:32:53] So my place sold in two days. It was just, you know, it's a nice, it was a very nice kind of, but it sold quickly. And there were fewer buyers. So I feel like I got my new place at a discount.
[00:33:05] So it actually worked out perfectly. And I think there's a lot of people sitting on the sidelines who want that three percent. I get it. Like I had it for years. It was the best. And I'm never going to see it again. And oh well, but I got this place at a huge discount as a result.
[00:33:20] So tell me about what sellers are up to these days.
[00:33:24] Yeah, you know, I think we hear from a lot of agents that sellers are still stuck in 2021. Right. They walk into that listing appointment and the sellers expecting that you're going to list their home for sale that there's going to be multiple offers of bidding wars, going to sell in four days above ask, just like their neighbors home did four years ago. Right.
[00:33:44] I think that's happening to some extent, but I think today's sellers are actually quite pragmatic.
[00:33:53] We know that more than half of sellers say that maximizing price is their top priority. Totally understand that.
[00:34:00] But a third of all sellers are now saying that their top priority is selling within their desired timeframe.
[00:34:09] So that's a bit of a shift, right. I think in today's market more than anything sellers want certainty.
[00:34:15] They want to know that their home is going to sell for a fair price that is going to sell within a reasonable timeframe.
[00:34:21] And they want to be able to move on with their lives and move on to their their next chapter.
[00:34:26] Yeah, I think that's right. And I think that that's a huge opportunity then for people just to sort of meet sellers where they're at and understanding those needs is really, really critical because that's exactly it.
[00:34:39] But you know, so I agree. And there are opportunities out there. And I think many agents aren't talking to sellers because they're afraid that they're going to be so driven just by the rate change.
[00:34:54] And really still rates are not historically high, right. They're just high compared to the last five years because of course they are because we read a historic lows at that time.
[00:35:05] So if we really like do the math, I mean, I didn't want to double my rate, but I could still do it. And like that was that's pretty cool.
[00:35:12] Like, you know, it's not so high that I couldn't do it. And there's a lot of people that are downsizing boomers.
[00:35:18] The average age of a seller or a buyer, sorry, a seller right now is between 56 and 59, which is crazy. Like I wouldn't have guessed that.
[00:35:29] And that's the majority of people who are selling right now. So it's like, this is a forgotten market. People are not reaching out to people that age because they're still working.
[00:35:37] They're thinking, oh, they're not doing any, they're not moving, but they are moving because maybe mom and dad might be moving in with them or maybe they're downsiding kids are now out of the house during college.
[00:35:47] They want to, you know, right size they call it now not downsizing. I guess downsizing is a bad word now. We're calling it right side.
[00:35:53] But, but anyway, they're making changes and this is a forgotten market where we're always looking younger and thinking those are the only people buying and they are.
[00:36:02] But a lot of older people are are. So this is the end by the way, they have tons of equity in their property.
[00:36:09] So they have they don't even know how much equity they have in their property. There's so much equity. 30% of these people are buying all cash on their next transaction. It's insane.
[00:36:18] So there are really cool opportunities out there and places like Zillow, you know, are great to get this data to the agents to remind everyone because we only know what's in our small little bubble of, you know, experience with the context we have and we just think, oh, you know, things are our good or bad or whatever based on our experience.
[00:36:37] And then it's like, oh, no, there's just all this other data and it really Zillow is probably the king of this data and it can expand this view and really I think change someone's attitude and mindset very quickly, whereas sort of the day to day work that you deal with with your existing sphere might give you a different world view.
[00:36:56] And you're like, oh boy, it feels like it's one that's actually another. And so that's why we're having these conversations. So I very so much appreciate.
[00:37:05] You know, you're talking about about that information. Let's talk about marketing because there's probably nothing that Zillow does better than marketing, right? You guys have become the number one place that people search online. I mean, there's not even a close second competitor.
[00:37:22] And it's just insane. So you understand how to drive interaction. You understand what buyers and sellers want. So tell us about adjusting, you know, an agent's marketing and brand positioning today's market.
[00:37:37] Yeah, that's the million dollar question for 2026, right? I think the first thing is to recognize your brand is not just your name or your logo, right? It's you. It's the promise that you're delivering.
[00:37:49] It's the sum of every single client interaction is every online review, every social media post and building a brand that clients trust really means showing up and showing up consistently and authentically and showing up with really clear values.
[00:38:07] So like what does that look like? I'll speak from experience at Zillow. You know, our brand is all about make action of home buying the movie experience a lot more supportive, more transparent, and more empowering for everyone for buyers, for sellers, for agents, right? And those core values are really at the center of every single decision that we make. And that honestly makes decisions a lot easier.
[00:38:31] So I think agents should clearly define what are their core values in 2026 and then let those kind of guide every touchpoint with clients.
[00:38:42] The second thing, you know, I know we've been talking so much about authenticity and consistency, but that that really is the secret to how you build trust.
[00:38:52] Today's clients want agents who are real, who are relatable, who are reliable, right? And when we're talking about consistency, it's consistency across all of your channels.
[00:39:01] So it's your website, it's your social media, it's your Zillow profile. All of that reinforces who you are, your professionalism, your brand, it keeps you top of mind.
[00:39:12] You don't have to be perfect on social media, right? You just have to show up in a real way, these authentic everyday moments, and that steady presence is really what builds the brand and builds loyalty over time.
[00:39:27] The third thing I would say is that take advantage of all the technology, all the tools that are out there right now, they can really amplify your brand.
[00:39:37] So your Zillow agent profile is your storefront, make sure it's up to date, that bio, your sales history. You can add a professional video, you can highlight your social media channels too, right?
[00:39:50] You can include testimonials, all of that stuff. And then, you know, tools like Showcase, of course, they work and they deliver this unified brand presence across all of your listings.
[00:40:02] And we have some research on this, you know, we know that agents who are using Showcase on more than half of their listings are winning 30% more clients than non-showcase agents.
[00:40:14] Really?
[00:40:15] Yeah, and it really is because those showcase listings result in more than 10,000 brand impressions in the first 90 days compared to, you know, non-showcase.
[00:40:26] So, you know, these tools work for agents, they help win business and they put your brand in front of more eyeballs.
[00:40:35] And then, you know, finally, I'll just put in a plug for data because I love it.
[00:40:39] I really truly believe that data can be your superpower as an agent.
[00:40:44] Zillow publishes local market insights all the time to help agents show up as the expert, right?
[00:40:50] As the most educated person out there. And it's not just every meeting, right? Every listing appointment.
[00:40:58] Agents are out and about in their communities all the time. And what's the first question that people always ask? They say, hey, how's the market? What's happening with the market?
[00:41:07] And wouldn't it be great to have that data nugget that you're able to pull out and share and show that you really are that neighborhood expert?
[00:41:18] Yeah, that's right. And again, that's what AI can't yet solve for. And, you know, maybe someday it can solve for experience. I hope not.
[00:41:26] But it does it today. And this is where the agent comes in and says, hey, I can help you make sense of this data.
[00:41:34] I actually can give you my personal experience based on however many years I've been servicing this particular market.
[00:41:40] And so I think you're absolutely right. It's getting the data. It's making fun use out of it and giving it to people in a way that's actually valuable to them. And again, they're not getting this many.
[00:41:52] They're not getting many calls from their other service providers. I promise you, they're not. There are accounts not calling them.
[00:41:57] This is the one opportunity you have to. I mean, if my account calls me, I'm going to be scared.
[00:42:02] There's something probably bad is happening, right? I find an actual advisor calls me. It's not going to be good.
[00:42:07] He's not going to say, hey, did you get like an extra hundred grand that you can just give me to, like, that's not going to be the call.
[00:42:13] It's going to be like, you're down a bunch of money and we got to make a change.
[00:42:16] But he doesn't do that because, you know, I, whatever. But the point is, is you have this opportunity to call and just get updates in people's lives, give them some data that might help make them a better decision.
[00:42:28] And also to having those conversations about why now even though rates are in the sixes, maybe it's a great time to sell.
[00:42:36] And why is that? Well, there's fewer buyers out there. And there's fewer homes on the market. You can sell your place pretty quick.
[00:42:41] If you find that perfect place, find it first, and then we'll sell your place and then we'll make them again.
[00:42:46] Whatever the situation is, you're at least having a conversation and you're creating value.
[00:42:51] And, you know, this, this is really the key to building those long-term relationships.
[00:42:56] So that 14 years from now, that agent is remembered and actually called.
[00:43:02] And I, you know, it's funny, my, my parents had a condo in Myrtle Beach, was like an investment property.
[00:43:07] And they would use it several times a year, but they would rent it out all the other times.
[00:43:11] And it took forever to sell it because it was just a bad market at the time.
[00:43:15] It took like five or six years. I think it took five different agents.
[00:43:20] And somebody was actually the last agent was really, really good. And afterwards, I kind of remember saying,
[00:43:25] did you guys ever sell that? And then my dad said, oh, yeah, we finally did. And like the agent was amazing.
[00:43:30] And I said, just out of curiosity, who was that agent? I mean, I'm in Chicago. It doesn't really matter.
[00:43:34] But I go, if I ever need to refer something over there, I'll refer to them. And my dad goes, I have no idea.
[00:43:40] And this was like two months after the closing, right? So it wasn't that my dad is like,
[00:43:45] he remembers things. And he didn't remember. And I was like, if my dad does not remember you after six years of trying to sell this property
[00:43:52] and somebody finally sold it, like you need to consider that everybody else has so much going on in their life that they're going to forget about you too,
[00:44:01] not because you're not special, but because you're not out there communicating in a way. And not just, hey, here's, here's my, you know, monthly newsletter.
[00:44:10] Like you got to do more than that. You got to actually call somebody and prove to them that you care about them and show them that you actually are thinking about them and that you are working for free in between those sales just to let them know how much how important they are to you.
[00:44:25] And you will be rewarded. They will call you back. They will use you if you stay in touch. And again, Amanda Pendleton was our guest and was our guest. And first Emmy award winner to be on our actually.
[00:44:38] Oh, I don't know. I'd have to go back. We've done 700 of these. So it's I think you're the first. So anyway, we are.
[00:44:46] Take it or the tent. You're not definitely not the tent. We are so excited that you were taking time away from your busy day in Seattle to help us and our listeners do a little bit better with their eight with their clients. And on behalf of our audience, we think Amanda for coming on here.
[00:45:05] And really just having a lot of great information to share and we'd love to have you back. And on behalf of Amanda and myself, thank you to everyone who's made it to the end of the show. We love you. We are so grateful for your listener watching. However you're doing this.
[00:45:18] And please, as always, the best way that you can help our show is by telling a friend.
[00:45:23] Think of another agent that could benefit from this conversation. By the way, they all could benefit. So just pass this over to somebody in your office. And we're everywhere podcasts are served.
[00:45:32] So just look for keeping it real. Unfortunately, there's about 20 other podcasts called keeping it real, which I should have thought about seven years ago when I first started, but I didn't. And now I'm stuck with this, but they can find me pretty easily just look for the one that says DJ.
[00:45:43] That's me. Jillian Michaels also has one. So that's not the same one. Think it's about fat loss.
[00:45:49] We have. We're very different people, but you could listen to hers as well, but keeping it real is easy to find where everywhere. And we appreciate you. Thanks to our sponsors for helping keep the show going. And we will see everybody on the next episode. Thanks Amanda.
[00:46:03] Thank you so much. DJ is great chatting with you.
[00:46:26] Thank you.

That's corded.io and now onto the show. Hey, welcome to Keeping It Real, the largest podcast made by real estate agents and for real estate agents. My name is DJ Paris. I'm your guide and host through the show. I'm very excited about today's episode because we're having a guest that we used to have on all the time and then they're back and we couldn't be more excited to talk to Zillow. Amanda Pendleton, specifically from Zillow, about all of the cool stuff that they know that agents maybe don't yet know and we're going to help guide you through some of that information so you can be more effective with your clients. Let me tell you more about Amanda. Amanda Pendleton is Zillow's house trends expert. Her practical data-driven advice on real estate, renovations and design has been featured. Listen, this is truly amazing on the today show on CBS Sunday morning, New York Times, real simple and on glamour. Amanda translates Zillow's housing market data into actionable advice for homeowners, buyers, sellers and renters.

She is passionate about renovating and restoring historic homes with design projects published in apartment therapy, Seattle magazine and Boston home magazine. Amanda, welcome to keeping it real. That was great to be here. Thanks, DJ. I am super excited to talk to you and I really believe that probably nobody has more information on home buyers and sellers than Zillow. I remember I was at an event, a Zillow event years ago, and this was just one of the sort of throwaway data points that was mentioned. It was brilliant that I wouldn't have known where they were saying, are data scientists have all this information that you probably just wouldn't think of? For example, if you show white linens on your bed or white bed spread, it has a 30% higher engagement rate. I was like, that's amazing. If I have an agent and I am doing photos for a list, I would probably keep a white duvet in my trunk. That's something I would never know. I love the fact that you guys know things like this and you don't just know things like that. It's amazing that there is this information and it can really help agents be more effective. 100% I think a lot of people don't know that Zillow has data scientists, an economist, an population scientist, a behavioral scientist. What's great about my job is that I get to work with all of them, which is exciting if you're a huge data nerd, which I am. What's also neat is that Zillow conducts the largest most comprehensive survey of more than 60,000 buyer sellers, renters and prospective buyers every single year. This is the largest private survey of its kind. The reason that we do this is because we know economic data is great. We love that. We got plenty of that. Here's the thing. DJ, you know this, your listeners know this. Buyers and sellers are not rational. They often act in ways that the economic models probably wouldn't predict them to act. This survey data really helps us better understand the market. What makes buyers and sellers tick? It informs a lot of our business decisions at Zillow and we freely share it with agents because we want to help them build and grow their businesses too. I think that is absolutely right on and really excited to have you here. Let's dive right into it. I know we wanted to talk about buyer loyalty. Let's talk about it. So what really stood out in our survey data this year is a number of things in terms of buyer loyalty. The first thing is that you know, repeat buyers are number one back in the market. They now represent 55% of all buyers, which is a majority. And that wasn't the case about a year and a half ago. These are homeowners who had been sitting on the sidelines for the past several years. They were waiting for rates to fall. They've gone through the five stages of grief, mourning the loss of that 3% mortgage, right? They've accepted, okay, those rates aren't coming back. They're finally listing their homes for sale at the highest rates we've seen since 2019. And a lot of them need somewhere to go. So repeat buyers are back in the market, but they're coming back different. They're not necessarily running back to their former agent who helped them the first time around. Yeah, that's interesting. I know the National Association of REALTORS shows every so many years they do this survey. And it's like 74% of home buyers and sellers would say they would use their agent again that they used previously. However, only like 14% actually do. So this is really a wonderful reminder to our agents that people forget about you. And here's some ways not to obviously have them forget about you. Yeah, and we actually have similar data and I'll walk you through it if you just bear with me here. When we asked recent buyers, so people who just bought their home, they just got their keys, they were just moving into their new house, would you work with the same agent to get in the future? 79% of them said, yes, absolutely. We loved our agent. Of course we'd work with them again. Well, then what happens time, time goes by and our data shows that it's usually 14 years. That's usually how long homeowners are in their homes before they sell again. So 14 years go by and only 13% of repeat or recent, yeah, repeat buyers say that they would hire the same or that they found their agent through past experience. Right. So that's a huge gap. 79% of people said, yes, of course I'd hire my agent again. 13% actually do. And there's a lot of reasons to explain that gap away, right. Maybe they move to a different city or neighborhood. Of course they need a different agent. Maybe their former agent retired or got out of the industry. You know, maybe it's been 14 years and they just forgot who they used the first time around, right. But it doesn't explain away every single buyer. There's still a significant share of repeat buyers who are simply deciding that another agent is going to be a better fit for their needs. And this is not a reflection on an agent's performance, right. Even if your client had a wonderful experience with you, their lives have changed. Maybe you helped them get into a condo in the city. And now they're looking for a four bedroom in the suburbs, right. They're looking for something different in their home and maybe something different in their agent. Yeah, I think that's absolutely right. And I think it also highlights the gap between or an opportunity rather that agents really need to consider, which is the old adage out of sight, out of mind, right. We love to think that people remember us that we're so important to them. And we had such a wonderful experience that 14 years later, of course they're going to give us a call. But if we're not continually priming that pomp, if we're not reaching out, if we're not proving to them over those next 14 years that we still care about them, we still are interested in their lives. We are checking in. We are asking them what's going on in their lives so that we know about these life events that may precipitate a move. They are going to look elsewhere because we know for sure they're going on Zillow, right. And they are going to go on Zillow and they're going to look for homes on their own. They do not need an agent to do that. And they might just say, you know what, let's see what other agents are out there. Yeah, I think, you know, for an agent, this really means loyalty cannot be assumed, right. Repay buyers are shopping around. In fact, we know that nearly half of repeat buyers, 46% spoke to two or more agents before they made their choice. So even if they are calling you, they may be calling someone else as well. And I think, you know, you hit on it, right. Agents need reengagement strategies. We know there's a lot that work as long as they are authentic. And I'm sure your listeners are really well versed in all these things. But, you know, we're talking about that regular market update email, right. That's tailored to their neighborhood. We're talking about checking in on those milestones. Maybe it's been a year since their purchase or their birthdays coming up. It's staying digitally visible, right. Maintaining that active social media presence, keeping all your online profiles updated. But I think most importantly, these communications have to feel authentic and they also have to add value, right. You just check in for the sake of checking in, right. Can you provide some helpful resources, you know, maybe it's a phone call that's, hey, I know you were thinking about making that that kitchen renovation or getting started on that construction project. But my other client just had a great experience for their contractor. I would be happy to connect you. Can I send along an email, something like that, right. You're adding value to that conversation. That's what really keeps you top of mind as a trusted advisor and not just, you know, as a pest. One of my favorite people in this business is a local agent here and she, her name is Amy, she's a Compass agent. And what she's been top 1% producer for, I don't know, 15 plus years. And I asked her, I said, what do you do every day? Because I'm always curious. I don't produce myself. So I'm always curious what top agents actually do day to day. And I expected her to give a state or dancer, which a lot of agents give, which is like, ah, my days are always really different. There's so much happening. It really, I can't give you a similar day. She said, I actually have kind of the same day every day. And or at least half of my day is the same. And she said, from eight until noon, or maybe it was nine until noon, she goes, I literally go to my phone. I go to my contact list, which all my clients and my sphere is in there. And I just start dialing. What's interesting is she says, I have about five or six reasons I might call somebody. But the one that is the most successful is kind of what you touched on, which is she said, hey, just checking in, I was curious. Do you have any home projects that you either not finished or not started? Right? Because everybody's, I just moved into this place. And we have a ton of projects that we've started and we have a ton more that we need to do. And so everybody's got that who, you know, has a has a home. So it's a brilliant question because the answer is always yes. And then she says, well, tell me about it. What's the project? And then they'll tell them. And she's, they'll tell her and she'll say, great, give me a few minutes. If she might know somebody right off the spot who can fix it or help start the project or finish it. Or she'll say, give me a day or two on this. I want to go to my database. I know the best people that can work on this. I'll get back to you. And again, it's like that's brilliant because it's maybe just the push that person needs number one to get the project completed. But it's a really helpful resource. So I love that strategy. I think that's brilliant. Right. Yeah. No, and you know, I've heard stories too about agents saying, you know, they'll call up a client and say, hey, I just drove by, you know, Dan's donuts. I thought of you. I know it's your favorite place. Right. Maybe they didn't drive by Dan's donuts. But, you know, it's reminding the client. I'm thinking about you. I remember you, your top of mind, you know, little things like that, making it personal, making it authentic. I think that's what works. Yeah, it's the one thing I cannot do yet. And maybe hope for a number, but certainly not yet. It cannot replace the I was driving by Dan's donuts. And I know that's your favorite place. And I'm thinking about you. And by the way, how are the kids doing and, you know, all the interpersonal stuff that is really ultimately most important because it speaks to intimacy. It speaks to care. Like I care about you. I actually think about you. And it's funny because we're not necessarily talking about real estate. Another reason to call somebody, which is also something you mentioned, is to give an updated, uh, CMA or in the Zillow terms, as estimate, right. Like everybody is looking up their's estimate, you know, whether agents believe that or not, they are. Everybody knows their's estimate, or at least they're looking it up occasionally. What I would do if I were a practicing agent, and I would call and say, oh my gosh, I was just checking out your estimate. Zillow thinks your home is worth like X, you know, whatever. I actually want to also run my own personal analysis just to see if I, if it matches up, because I really know this market really well. And I'm curious if, if our data matches up, I'm going to go ahead and do that for you to send that over to you. Right. Like another great reason to reach out. The estimate, I think, is one of the best ways to reconnect with people because everybody's looking at it. Yeah, no 100% agree. I love that strategy. And I think also just, you know, reaching out with reassurance, people read headlines, right. They're seeing a national story, a national market that may be very different from what's happening in their particular neighborhood. And an agent as that trusted expert can say, hey, you may be seeing this, but here's what's really happening in your neighborhood, you know, we're seeing home sell 10 days faster than the national average or whatever it is, right. So some kind of reassurance that like your home value is still strong. We still think that we're going to be able to sell your home if you're interested in that. And we can help you get into a new one. Yeah, it's funny. I'm just thinking about this. You know, who doesn't call me with things like that, my accountant, my financial advisor, my, who else, my attorneys, like, I really don't get my insurance agent. I don't, and again, I love all these people. Like, I'm in no way speaking pejorative to them. I really, truly, I have a great team. But they're not really doing that. Maybe they don't have to. And I'm not suggesting that they should, but real estate agents have this opportunity that other service professionals don't. And it really, like, it would be kind of weird if my accountant called me just to see how I was doing, even though I really like her. I don't, you know, we don't have that kind of relationship. But real estate agents do. And I think that's a really important thing is to bring that interpersonal part back and add value. Let's talk about online research. You guys are the king of online research. Yeah, I think in the past, finding an agent was really all about who you knew referrals were king. And those referrals from friends and family members are still really important today. But our data is showing that times are changing. And today an increasing number of buyers are finding their agent online. And I can do a comparison for you. You know, if we look at referrals, right, about one in five buyers and sellers say they were relying referrals from family members and friends to find an agent. We've seen that share fall over the past seven years. Now at the same time, more than a third of buyers and sellers now say they found their agent online. So that could be a real estate portal. It could be a search engine. It could be social media. And that share has doubled in the past seven years. So this is not just a fleeting trend. This is a fundamental shift in how agent relationships begin. And the hiring decision is happening before that first conversation. Agents who understand this are kind of in a better position to win. Yeah, so what would you suggest an agent might do to beef up or make sure that their online presence is what they would want. Because you're right. Even if it's, I mean, maybe if it's not your best friend, but if it's a friend of your best friend who's referred to you, they're still going to Google you. They're still going to look up your reviews. They're going to look up your Zilla reviews. They're going to look up your Google reviews. They are also going to see what comes up when they type in your name. Just like, you know, would be on a first date. People do that as well. And so what might what is what is Zilla suggest that agents, you know, should do to make sure that when they are people are researching you that they ultimately, you know, find good stuff. Yes, your online presence is your 24 seven storefront, right. It's your digital storefront. So here's some things you got to be thinking about. I think number one first impressions are really happening on social media now. Our data shows that nearly half of prospective buyers, 44% of prospective buyers say they're more willing to hire an agent who's got a social media presence. The second thing, your client reviews, your past sales, your bio, it's got to be everywhere online. And it's because buyers and sellers aren't just googling you. Now they're using, you know, Gemini and chat GPT. So you need to be findable. And you need to have all that stuff get pulled into those AI generated searches. And then the third thing I think is to demonstrate your value clearly online, right. You want to show your process. You want to show your market knowledge. You want to demonstrate your results, right. I think you just don't want to leave someone guessing what the experience is going to be like working with you. You want to make that very clear up front. Yeah, I think that's right. And a lot of agents really sort of ignore that and just assume the referral sort of game is enough, right. Like my clients will tell it. And yes, that does work. And it does obviously drive leads. But if you don't have this online presence to supplement or to compliment that, it's really hard for somebody who hasn't ever met you to feel comfortable or maybe you have an Instagram channel or a YouTube channel that also goes a little deeper into sort of who you are and what you're all about. And that can obviously supplement that too. But I think having a good looking website is critical. I don't think you need the home search portal on your site. A lot of agents have, you know, there's a lot of debate about whether that's important. And still has already got that covered. You don't really have to do that. People don't need your site for that. But what they do need your site for. And again, I'm not picking on anyone that has that. We have it on our sites as for our agents as well. We actually think it's cool. But what people really want to see when they go to your site is tell me your story. Who are you. What are you all about. Why should I hire you. You know, give me the warm and fuzzies and show me competence. And let me, you know, obviously make the decision that way. But be absolutely right. It's funny. I get referrals from. So we have at our company. We have about 700 agents. And we get referrals from those agents. Thankfully, we're so fortunate. Our agents like us and they say, I tell other agents, oh, you should talk to DJ. And you would think that those are just easy slam dunks. And sometimes they are. But oftentimes they're like, oh, yeah, I want on your website and I read everything about you guys. It's like, oh, yeah, of course you did. I would do the same thing. So, of course, that's super important. And this is the time. This is the year to just make sure because again, with AI searching being more and more prevalent. I think I think the days of Google searching is coming to an end. I really do. I think in five years, we will not be searching that way. We will just be talking into our phones. I mean, we pretty much are doing that now anyway, but it'll be much more seamless. And AI knows how to search much faster than a human can search. And it can hit a lot more search results. So you want to make sure that your content is super valuable, not only to, to users, but also to AI. And so learn about what AI looks for in content and create that content. And also AI knows great videos too. So it can actually recommend you when people are searching not for you, but just for standard content. So yeah, I think I think that's a great, great sort of series of suggestions. And always something to to keep in mind. I want to talk about Gen Z because this is confusing to me. It's not confusing to me. I think it's somewhat unfortunate that they're in. Look, we know it's it is not tough. The middle class, it is tough being in the middle class right now. It's tough being Gen Z. The purchase power isn't quite what some of the previous generations had. And that's unfortunate. And it is a bummer. What we do know for sure is that the average first time home buyer age is going up and it's going up significantly. And it's a real shame because I don't necessarily think it's an unavoidable thing. I think a lot of younger generations, especially Gen Z, maybe just don't understand the ability that you have to actually accumulate wealth throughout your lifetime with your house. And if you start buying your home later, you lose out on a lot of things. And that's one of that opportunity. So yeah, tell us about what what is Gen Z up to? Are they renting? Are they buying? And what do they want from an agent? Yeah, what I think was surprising in our data is that we found Gen Z is playing a much bigger part in the market than we kind of anticipated, I think. And that a lot of people think you think about Gen Z is, you know, they're snapping selfies. They're making a tick-tock dances. They're not buying homes. Well, it turns out they are. They make up 20% of US adults now. They make up 18% of home buyers, 14% of home sellers. And as they age, that share is just going to go up. The oldest Gen Z right now is 30 years old. That kind of blew my mind and made me feel really old. But something else that might surprise you is that Gen Z is making 50% more income than baby boomers were at their age. And they have access to the bank of mom and dad, right? 46% of Gen Z buyers are getting a gift or a loan from a family member or a friend to buy a home compared to 35% of all buyers. So they're getting some help. It's not all smooth sailing. You touched on it. Affordability, huge deal. This generation is the most likely to be denied a mortgage. A third of all Gen Z buyers are initially denied a mortgage. But then they persist, right, until they do secure that loan. I think that's something huge about this generation. They're really scrappy and they're really resilient. And they still believe in this American dream of home ownership. Yeah, I think that's that is exciting. I'm glad that those those numbers are changing because we're seeing the first time home buyer age is now like 39 and it's like it should not be that because again, you're just going to be missing out on appreciation. It's not. And what's so wonderful to hear is that yes, we know that as as boomers are retiring, baby boomers retiring, that largest, you know, there's going to be this gigantic wealth transfer for even the generation prior to that. It's going to be passing that into boom the boomer generation and that's going to be passing down into like the millennials and Gen Zs. And that's where a lot of these down payments come from. And I could not agree with you more. My sister and I were both fortunate enough to be able to get our first places due to our parents being saving. And we wouldn't have been able to do it otherwise. And not everybody gets that that luxury. But more people are getting that opportunity. So I think that's a great sort of opportunity for agents right now to consider having those conversations with Gen Z, even the ones that don't think they should be buying or maybe have a negative stigma attached to to what home buying or maybe I can't afford it. And you know, having those conversations about well, here's how it actually works. And let's talk about renting versus buying and let's sort of figure out, you know, what the opportunities are because I know for sure what went when I before I bought my first place, which is in 2005 somewhere around there. I didn't know that I could purchase like I just thought, oh, that's that's not for people like that's not for me. I don't have enough money. Well turns out I did, but I didn't know I did right or and my parents were able to help supplement that to make it happen. So as soon as I did some research on my own, nobody helped me that I was able to say, oh, I can do this, but I was too embarrassed to ask. So I think it's an opportunity for agents to really go to that younger generation and say, let's have a conversation about this. Like, you're probably closer than you think. So great, great, great opportunities there. And you know, we see it in on Zillow, right? We're looking at user behavior and Gen Z, they're really active dual shoppers. So they're looking at rentals on Zillow and they're looking on the first sale side too and they're kind of toggling back and forth and ultimately they're just trying to find the best deal. Right? So we have all these great tools right now, things like viability where you can go online, you plug in some personal financial information. It will show you exactly how much home you can actually afford. And you can do that. You get that number without having to pick up the phone and call a loan officer, which I think is a huge barrier for a lot of Gen Z perspective buyers. It's intimidating to call a loan officer if you've never talked to one because they are going to ask you a lot of questions that will likely make you squirm. I mean, I've been, I had many loans. Every time I have to do it, I squirm a little bit giving them all of my statements. It always feels a little bit like, you know, taking off my clothes in front of a stranger. And it is not always the greatest thing. So I love that you guys have tools that allow people to sort of at least slowly step into that that realm without feeling so intimidated because of course it can be. So I love that, you know, there are tools that just allow people to get more instant information. And Gen Z is interesting as well because they're not people that talk on the phone very often. Right? That's another way. So like the way they communicate is different. And yeah, they're doing the TikTok dances and, you know, they're scrolling social media, but they're texting a lot, right? That's probably their primary way of communication with other people and are personally, you know, when they're not face to face. And that's something that agents really have to sort of wrap their mind around is you really need to meet the client where they're at. And if you're a phone person and you call Gen Z people and you will find out real quickly if they're a phone person. And you have to adjust and it's not easy sometimes for like I grew up talking on the phone. I don't know if you did or not, but I didn't grow up texting. So it just I still do it. But it's not my I would rather pick up the phone most most of the time because I want to have longer form conversations. They like shorter form conversations. So communications learning that those styles are really important. Yeah, no, I it's sort of that running joke, right? That Gen Z is allergic to the phone, but what we're seeing increasingly across our data is that most buyers and sellers would prefer a text message than a phone call, right? I think 50% of buyers say that's their preferred method of communication now. Only a third of buyers say that a phone calls their preferred method of communication. I mean, obviously if you got something bigger to discuss a phone calls appropriate, but I think if a Gen Z client is texting you, you need to text back, right? Don't pick up the phone and call them. They're not going to answer. And then the other thing with Gen Z is that you want to sound like a human and not like a robot, a chatbot, right? They are all about authenticity. They can sniff out when someone's reading a script or someone's being fake with them, right? So I think it is sort of matching your communication style with theirs. And I love to that being a REALTOR is one of those professions that is unlike maybe a financial advisor or an accountant or an attorney to the, you know, obviously that you can express your own creativity and identity and personality in those professions too, but you're probably more limited. And those professions have a particular association with a style of dress or a style of conversation and REALTOR's kind of don't really have that. So it's fun when I have people on my show that really are being completely authentic and maybe that's not sort of even what, you know, is a mainstream form of like communication or style of dress or, and they can like really be themselves have an incredible career. So I love that with agents. It's probably the profession that you can make the most amount of money being authentically yourself to any probably any other. And so that's kind of a cool thing too, because you're right authenticity is everything. And it's what people want. And the cool part is you just get to be yourself. So it's like it's actually kind of a win all the way around if you're willing to show up as you are. Let's talk about sellers because sellers are the other half of the game. So what are sellers wanting right now? I just sold a property and I gave up that three percent mortgage and nobody was less happy to do it than me, but I was happy to do it because I'm getting married. And of course that makes perfect sense at a good reason to do it and I upsized. So I doubled my square footage. So I'm really grateful for that. But I also did double my market, my mortgage payment, which is not as much fun, but, but you know what? It was made sense. And the reason why I did it is because there were fewer homes on the market to sell. So my place sold in two days. It was just, you know, it's a nice, it was a very nice kind of, but it sold quickly. And there were fewer buyers. So I feel like I got my new place at a discount. So it actually worked out perfectly. And I think there's a lot of people sitting on the sidelines who want that three percent. I get it. Like I had it for years. It was the best. And I'm never going to see it again. And oh well, but I got this place at a huge discount as a result. So tell me about what sellers are up to these days. Yeah, you know, I think we hear from a lot of agents that sellers are still stuck in 2021. Right. They walk into that listing appointment and the sellers expecting that you're going to list their home for sale that there's going to be multiple offers of bidding wars, going to sell in four days above ask, just like their neighbors home did four years ago. Right. I think that's happening to some extent, but I think today's sellers are actually quite pragmatic. We know that more than half of sellers say that maximizing price is their top priority. Totally understand that. But a third of all sellers are now saying that their top priority is selling within their desired timeframe. So that's a bit of a shift, right. I think in today's market more than anything sellers want certainty. They want to know that their home is going to sell for a fair price that is going to sell within a reasonable timeframe. And they want to be able to move on with their lives and move on to their their next chapter. Yeah, I think that's right. And I think that that's a huge opportunity then for people just to sort of meet sellers where they're at and understanding those needs is really, really critical because that's exactly it. But you know, so I agree. And there are opportunities out there. And I think many agents aren't talking to sellers because they're afraid that they're going to be so driven just by the rate change. And really still rates are not historically high, right. They're just high compared to the last five years because of course they are because we read a historic lows at that time. So if we really like do the math, I mean, I didn't want to double my rate, but I could still do it. And like that was that's pretty cool. Like, you know, it's not so high that I couldn't do it. And there's a lot of people that are downsizing boomers. The average age of a seller or a buyer, sorry, a seller right now is between 56 and 59, which is crazy. Like I wouldn't have guessed that. And that's the majority of people who are selling right now. So it's like, this is a forgotten market. People are not reaching out to people that age because they're still working. They're thinking, oh, they're not doing any, they're not moving, but they are moving because maybe mom and dad might be moving in with them or maybe they're downsiding kids are now out of the house during college. They want to, you know, right size they call it now not downsizing. I guess downsizing is a bad word now. We're calling it right side. But, but anyway, they're making changes and this is a forgotten market where we're always looking younger and thinking those are the only people buying and they are. But a lot of older people are are. So this is the end by the way, they have tons of equity in their property. So they have they don't even know how much equity they have in their property. There's so much equity. 30% of these people are buying all cash on their next transaction. It's insane. So there are really cool opportunities out there and places like Zillow, you know, are great to get this data to the agents to remind everyone because we only know what's in our small little bubble of, you know, experience with the context we have and we just think, oh, you know, things are our good or bad or whatever based on our experience. And then it's like, oh, no, there's just all this other data and it really Zillow is probably the king of this data and it can expand this view and really I think change someone's attitude and mindset very quickly, whereas sort of the day to day work that you deal with with your existing sphere might give you a different world view. And you're like, oh boy, it feels like it's one that's actually another. And so that's why we're having these conversations. So I very so much appreciate. You know, you're talking about about that information. Let's talk about marketing because there's probably nothing that Zillow does better than marketing, right? You guys have become the number one place that people search online. I mean, there's not even a close second competitor. And it's just insane. So you understand how to drive interaction. You understand what buyers and sellers want. So tell us about adjusting, you know, an agent's marketing and brand positioning today's market. Yeah, that's the million dollar question for 2026, right? I think the first thing is to recognize your brand is not just your name or your logo, right? It's you. It's the promise that you're delivering. It's the sum of every single client interaction is every online review, every social media post and building a brand that clients trust really means showing up and showing up consistently and authentically and showing up with really clear values. So like what does that look like? I'll speak from experience at Zillow. You know, our brand is all about make action of home buying the movie experience a lot more supportive, more transparent, and more empowering for everyone for buyers, for sellers, for agents, right? And those core values are really at the center of every single decision that we make. And that honestly makes decisions a lot easier. So I think agents should clearly define what are their core values in 2026 and then let those kind of guide every touchpoint with clients. The second thing, you know, I know we've been talking so much about authenticity and consistency, but that that really is the secret to how you build trust. Today's clients want agents who are real, who are relatable, who are reliable, right? And when we're talking about consistency, it's consistency across all of your channels. So it's your website, it's your social media, it's your Zillow profile. All of that reinforces who you are, your professionalism, your brand, it keeps you top of mind. You don't have to be perfect on social media, right? You just have to show up in a real way, these authentic everyday moments, and that steady presence is really what builds the brand and builds loyalty over time. The third thing I would say is that take advantage of all the technology, all the tools that are out there right now, they can really amplify your brand. So your Zillow agent profile is your storefront, make sure it's up to date, that bio, your sales history. You can add a professional video, you can highlight your social media channels too, right? You can include testimonials, all of that stuff. And then, you know, tools like Showcase, of course, they work and they deliver this unified brand presence across all of your listings. And we have some research on this, you know, we know that agents who are using Showcase on more than half of their listings are winning 30% more clients than non-showcase agents. Really? Yeah, and it really is because those showcase listings result in more than 10,000 brand impressions in the first 90 days compared to, you know, non-showcase. So, you know, these tools work for agents, they help win business and they put your brand in front of more eyeballs. And then, you know, finally, I'll just put in a plug for data because I love it. I really truly believe that data can be your superpower as an agent. Zillow publishes local market insights all the time to help agents show up as the expert, right? As the most educated person out there. And it's not just every meeting, right? Every listing appointment. Agents are out and about in their communities all the time. And what's the first question that people always ask? They say, hey, how's the market? What's happening with the market? And wouldn't it be great to have that data nugget that you're able to pull out and share and show that you really are that neighborhood expert? Yeah, that's right. And again, that's what AI can't yet solve for. And, you know, maybe someday it can solve for experience. I hope not. But it does it today. And this is where the agent comes in and says, hey, I can help you make sense of this data. I actually can give you my personal experience based on however many years I've been servicing this particular market. And so I think you're absolutely right. It's getting the data. It's making fun use out of it and giving it to people in a way that's actually valuable to them. And again, they're not getting this many. They're not getting many calls from their other service providers. I promise you, they're not. There are accounts not calling them. This is the one opportunity you have to. I mean, if my account calls me, I'm going to be scared. There's something probably bad is happening, right? I find an actual advisor calls me. It's not going to be good. He's not going to say, hey, did you get like an extra hundred grand that you can just give me to, like, that's not going to be the call. It's going to be like, you're down a bunch of money and we got to make a change. But he doesn't do that because, you know, I, whatever. But the point is, is you have this opportunity to call and just get updates in people's lives, give them some data that might help make them a better decision. And also to having those conversations about why now even though rates are in the sixes, maybe it's a great time to sell. And why is that? Well, there's fewer buyers out there. And there's fewer homes on the market. You can sell your place pretty quick. If you find that perfect place, find it first, and then we'll sell your place and then we'll make them again. Whatever the situation is, you're at least having a conversation and you're creating value. And, you know, this, this is really the key to building those long-term relationships. So that 14 years from now, that agent is remembered and actually called. And I, you know, it's funny, my, my parents had a condo in Myrtle Beach, was like an investment property. And they would use it several times a year, but they would rent it out all the other times. And it took forever to sell it because it was just a bad market at the time. It took like five or six years. I think it took five different agents. And somebody was actually the last agent was really, really good. And afterwards, I kind of remember saying, did you guys ever sell that? And then my dad said, oh, yeah, we finally did. And like the agent was amazing. And I said, just out of curiosity, who was that agent? I mean, I'm in Chicago. It doesn't really matter. But I go, if I ever need to refer something over there, I'll refer to them. And my dad goes, I have no idea. And this was like two months after the closing, right? So it wasn't that my dad is like, he remembers things. And he didn't remember. And I was like, if my dad does not remember you after six years of trying to sell this property and somebody finally sold it, like you need to consider that everybody else has so much going on in their life that they're going to forget about you too, not because you're not special, but because you're not out there communicating in a way. And not just, hey, here's, here's my, you know, monthly newsletter. Like you got to do more than that. You got to actually call somebody and prove to them that you care about them and show them that you actually are thinking about them and that you are working for free in between those sales just to let them know how much how important they are to you. And you will be rewarded. They will call you back. They will use you if you stay in touch. And again, Amanda Pendleton was our guest and was our guest. And first Emmy award winner to be on our actually. Oh, I don't know. I'd have to go back. We've done 700 of these. So it's I think you're the first. So anyway, we are. Take it or the tent. You're not definitely not the tent. We are so excited that you were taking time away from your busy day in Seattle to help us and our listeners do a little bit better with their eight with their clients. And on behalf of our audience, we think Amanda for coming on here. And really just having a lot of great information to share and we'd love to have you back. And on behalf of Amanda and myself, thank you to everyone who's made it to the end of the show. We love you. We are so grateful for your listener watching. However you're doing this. And please, as always, the best way that you can help our show is by telling a friend. Think of another agent that could benefit from this conversation. By the way, they all could benefit. So just pass this over to somebody in your office. And we're everywhere podcasts are served. So just look for keeping it real. Unfortunately, there's about 20 other podcasts called keeping it real, which I should have thought about seven years ago when I first started, but I didn't. And now I'm stuck with this, but they can find me pretty easily just look for the one that says DJ. That's me. Jillian Michaels also has one. So that's not the same one. Think it's about fat loss. We have. We're very different people, but you could listen to hers as well, but keeping it real is easy to find where everywhere. And we appreciate you. Thanks to our sponsors for helping keep the show going. And we will see everybody on the next episode. Thanks Amanda. Thank you so much. DJ is great chatting with you. Thank you.
