[00:01:16] Today's episode is brought to you by corded.io.
[00:01:19] Are you looking for agents to join your brokerage or team?
[00:01:23] Now, as a real estate recruiter,
[00:01:25] I can tell you the answer is always yes.
[00:01:27] But most agents aren't looking to move right now.
[00:01:30] So how do you know who to contact?
[00:01:32] Well, what if I were to tell you there's a recruiting
[00:01:34] and retention tool powered by artificial intelligence
[00:01:37] that shows you exactly which agents in your local market
[00:01:41] are looking to leave their brokerage right now
[00:01:43] and which agents at your own firm
[00:01:46] are also looking to leave you.
[00:01:48] Now, I've been recruiting REALTORS for 15 years
[00:01:51] and I've hired over 2000 agents.
[00:01:53] I can tell you with no exaggeration,
[00:01:55] this is the tool I've been waiting for.
[00:01:57] Corded's AI looks for trends across dozens of variables
[00:02:00] for each agent in your market
[00:02:02] and shows you which agents they believe are likely to move.
[00:02:05] Not only does it do that, but corded's AI went
[00:02:08] and visited my recruiting website
[00:02:10] and read everything I offer.
[00:02:12] So now when I'm recruiting, corded's AI tells me
[00:02:15] exactly what to say based on that agent's needs
[00:02:18] and what my brokerage can offer.
[00:02:20] It even writes emails for me.
[00:02:22] I've never seen anything like it
[00:02:24] and I use it every single day.
[00:02:26] Now, if you are looking to grow your brokerage,
[00:02:29] corded.io is the best tool out there.
[00:02:32] Visit corded.io to schedule a demo again.
[00:02:35] That's corded.io and now onto the show.
[00:02:38] Now,
[00:02:39] 
[00:02:51] Hey, welcome to Keeping It Real,
[00:02:54] the largest podcast made by real estate agents
[00:02:56] and for real estate agents.
[00:02:58] My name is DJ Paris.
[00:02:59] I am your guide and host through the show today
[00:03:02] as our monthly series.
[00:03:03] I think this is our fifth or sixth
[00:03:05] straight year of doing this.
[00:03:07] This called the Monday Market Minute with Carrie McCormick
[00:03:09] from the Carrie McCormick real estate group here in Chicago
[00:03:13] with at properties, a Christie's International.
[00:03:16] A Carrie is a top top top top 1% producer here in Chicago
[00:03:19] with over 20 years of experience,
[00:03:21] helping buyers, sellers and investors.
[00:03:24] She is a true superstar and expert in everything
[00:03:27] from first time home buyers, veteran investors
[00:03:29] and especially luxury properties.
[00:03:31] She also works with a lot of developers
[00:03:33] and is often chosen to represent their high end developments.
[00:03:37] I want everybody to follow Carrie on Instagram
[00:03:40] because she is an amazing model of what you can do
[00:03:44] with your own Instagram account.
[00:03:47] She does it all herself.
[00:03:48] It is truly remarkable.
[00:03:49] It's probably the best looking Instagram account
[00:03:52] I've ever seen for REALTOR.
[00:03:53] So that's Carrie McCormick real estate
[00:03:55] and two season McCormick will have a link to that
[00:03:58] in the show notes.
[00:03:58] Carrie, welcome once again.
[00:04:00] Wow, I love that introduction.
[00:04:01] So thank you for that.
[00:04:03] Well, we're too humble to say, but this is possibly,
[00:04:08] you're on pace for this to be your very best year ever.
[00:04:11] And I have yet to hear anyone in 2025 say that.
[00:04:14] So congratulations.
[00:04:16] Oh, well, I love that.
[00:04:18] Yeah, and actually, that's kind of a little bit
[00:04:20] about what I wanted to talk about.
[00:04:23] I have been a broker in Chicago for this stills
[00:04:27] with the same two decades.
[00:04:29] Wow, right?
[00:04:30] So over 20 years.
[00:04:32] But through that 20 years, I've been working
[00:04:33] extremely hard, extremely focused on my business
[00:04:36] and just how I wanted to frame it.
[00:04:38] And you're right.
[00:04:39] This year, we're mid-Word July, at the end of July 2025.
[00:04:44] And I am at $250 million.
[00:04:48] Wow.
[00:04:49] Closed and pending.
[00:04:51] So I've got about $195 closed
[00:04:56] and then another little over 50 pending to close.
[00:05:00] And I've got fill in my pipeline for the rest of the year.
[00:05:04] So I'm hoping to break 300, which again, keep in mind,
[00:05:10] I do not have a big team.
[00:05:11] I am a solo agent.
[00:05:13] I have support staff underneath me.
[00:05:15] But it took, again, years to build and form
[00:05:19] what I wanted to create.
[00:05:21] And one of those things is staying local.
[00:05:25] So through the pandemic, especially here in Chicago
[00:05:28] for those real estate agents from Chicago
[00:05:31] or some of the Midwest states, everyone
[00:05:33] started moving to Florida, Arizona, Colorado,
[00:05:36] which is fabulous and great.
[00:05:38] And a lot of agents spread their wings and said,
[00:05:41] OK, I'm going to open up an office in Florida, in Arizona,
[00:05:44] wherever, in Colorado, et cetera.
[00:05:47] And I think as much as I wanted to do that,
[00:05:50] because I love those markets and to be able to service
[00:05:53] my clients, I decided that I am going to stay local.
[00:05:57] I say, I'm going to stay in my lane.
[00:05:59] And because of that, I put the puddle to the metal.
[00:06:03] I over-marketed during that time.
[00:06:05] And I ended up dominating the market here in Chicago.
[00:06:08] Because again, everyone was outspwriting their wings,
[00:06:11] a little bit trying to service and take advantage
[00:06:12] of other hot markets, which people did.
[00:06:15] And it was great.
[00:06:16] So nothing against that.
[00:06:17] But I wanted to stay hyper local and have that approach.
[00:06:22] But I did want to say or have some national
[00:06:26] and international network, too, right?
[00:06:29] Because when you're building trust with high network clients,
[00:06:33] you want to deliver global reach.
[00:06:36] And I didn't want to leave my city.
[00:06:38] So I am with Christie's International.
[00:06:41] I have an incredible network of brokers,
[00:06:43] nationally and internationally.
[00:06:44] So when one of my clients says to me,
[00:06:48] we're moving to Paris, we're moving to Colorado.
[00:06:51] Wherever they're moving to, I say, that's amazing.
[00:06:54] I'm going to sell your property here.
[00:06:56] I'm not an expert in Colorado using this example.
[00:07:00] But I have a trusted advisor and partner there
[00:07:02] that I'd love to introduce you to.
[00:07:05] So you just do that handoff.
[00:07:06] And obviously you take a referral fee.
[00:07:08] So again, I'm servicing my clients.
[00:07:11] I'm giving them the best service by giving them someone
[00:07:14] who's also an expert in that.
[00:07:16] So think about this.
[00:07:18] So again, there's this idea when you grow,
[00:07:21] you have to scale wide.
[00:07:23] But instead of thinking of going wide,
[00:07:26] think about going deep within your market.
[00:07:28] 
[00:07:30] And when you're dealing with your clients,
[00:07:33] and everyone knows this, they can sense your confidence.
[00:07:36] They can sense what you're talking about
[00:07:38] when you know the market.
[00:07:39] And you just really can't fake that stuff.
[00:07:41] You have to be ingrained in your market.
[00:07:43] And people feel it.
[00:07:45] If I'm trying to make up something, which I don't do,
[00:07:48] but if you're stumbling with something,
[00:07:50] your clients can feel that.
[00:07:52] And they know when you're in your zone
[00:07:53] and when you're out of your zone.
[00:07:55] So I think that was super key to me growing my business.
[00:07:59] And again, 2025, being at the point where I am,
[00:08:03] because again, I advertised I marketed the heck out of me
[00:08:08] being local here and the expert in the market.
[00:08:10] I think too, for those of us that aren't quite at the level
[00:08:14] where we would think about expanding into another city,
[00:08:17] the same idea applies to expanding within your own city.
[00:08:21] And really thinking small and thinking,
[00:08:23] okay, yes, maybe there's other parts of my suburbs
[00:08:27] or the city or my neighborhoods that I really service.
[00:08:30] That yeah, I'd love to expand and be everywhere.
[00:08:33] But particularly, could I really provide,
[00:08:35] especially here in Chicago,
[00:08:36] we have so many different markets here.
[00:08:39] You couldn't be an expert in all,
[00:08:40] even all of the ones here.
[00:08:42] And as a result, it always makes sense, in my opinion,
[00:08:45] to like you said, go narrow, but go deep within that narrow focus.
[00:08:49] Like I always think there was,
[00:08:51] you know, I'm sure Michael Rosenblum,
[00:08:53] he's an agent here in Chicago.
[00:08:54] He did some very smart, many, many, many years.
[00:08:58] I don't know if he still does this,
[00:08:59] but he used to call himself Mr. River North,
[00:09:01] because he was,
[00:09:02] That's right.
[00:09:03] Basically, yeah, we're sort of laugh about it,
[00:09:05] but it was really smart because he did River North.
[00:09:08] And like when you River North, you were like,
[00:09:10] oh, Michael Rosenblum, he's Mr. River North.
[00:09:12] And he did probably more deals there than anyone
[00:09:14] during my period.
[00:09:15] And that's all he did.
[00:09:17] And it was like, he's in Gail Spring does Streeterville.
[00:09:20] There are people that, you know,
[00:09:22] yeah, you do things a little bit outside of your market
[00:09:24] from time to time when you can,
[00:09:25] but really, really smart.
[00:09:27] And you know, we think about this like with recruiting.
[00:09:29] We often think,
[00:09:30] well, what state should we go to next at Kale?
[00:09:33] And it's like, there's 43,000 agents here in Chicago.
[00:09:35] We only have 700 of them.
[00:09:37] Like we don't have that many.
[00:09:39] And you know, at properties,
[00:09:40] Christie's you guys have probably three to 4,000.
[00:09:42] You guys don't even have that many.
[00:09:44] And you're like, this firm.
[00:09:45] So there are so much opportunity here locally,
[00:09:49] whether, you know, and it's about like you said,
[00:09:51] going, going really deep.
[00:09:53] And again, also like with the best possible experience
[00:09:56] for the client, well, if you get your reputation,
[00:09:59] it isn't to try to get licensed in Colorado
[00:10:01] and then do a deal in Aspen.
[00:10:03] And unless you live there half the year, maybe, you know,
[00:10:06] but you're not, you're best off handing it to somebody.
[00:10:09] And that's something that, you know,
[00:10:11] we really should think about, we get a deal.
[00:10:12] And maybe it's just a little bit in a neighborhood
[00:10:14] or an area that we don't know.
[00:10:16] And we want to do the deal because that's a lot of money.
[00:10:18] But if it's something that we truly can't,
[00:10:21] can't really service to the degree that we owe to the client,
[00:10:25] you're a fiduciary.
[00:10:26] Like your job is to get them the highest price
[00:10:28] or the lowest price if you're buying.
[00:10:30] And if you feel like you can't do that way better
[00:10:33] to get somebody that absolutely knows that market.
[00:10:36] And what's really cool too is chat GBT will literally tell you
[00:10:39] like you could go in.
[00:10:40] It's not always accurate.
[00:10:41] But you could say who sells the most homes
[00:10:43] in this neighborhood or who's, you know,
[00:10:45] has the most buy side deals or whatever it might be.
[00:10:48] And you'll get some, or just, you know,
[00:10:50] call up your local aboard and ask them
[00:10:52] and they can run those numbers for you.
[00:10:53] And you can find really good people.
[00:10:55] And I think that's really smart.
[00:10:57] And again too, I just, I wanted to ask Keri,
[00:11:00] you something because you're doing so many deals.
[00:11:03] You do a lot of listings.
[00:11:04] I am, and you do a lot of everything,
[00:11:06] but a lot of listings.
[00:11:07] And right now I just hear people consistently saying,
[00:11:10] gosh, you know, all my buy, my sellers are locked
[00:11:13] into a 3% mortgage.
[00:11:15] They don't need to move.
[00:11:16] They don't want to move.
[00:11:18] They don't want to give up that 3%.
[00:11:19] Well, I'm actually going to be moving shortly.
[00:11:22] I don't want to give up my 3% but I'd rather give it up
[00:11:26] and not have a lot less competition on the buy side.
[00:11:29] Right.
[00:11:29] Right now.
[00:11:30] And so I'm curious like what do you say to sellers
[00:11:33] who are like, yeah, I guess I could sell now,
[00:11:35] but I just don't want to give up that rate.
[00:11:37] Yeah.
[00:11:38] Well, I mean, obviously we've got to follow their lead,
[00:11:40] but sometimes you don't have to look just macro,
[00:11:44] you know, of or micro into like what that rate is.
[00:11:48] If you're really unhappy in your home
[00:11:49] or the space that you're in,
[00:11:51] but you're staying there because of the interest rate,
[00:11:53] I always think that that's a bad idea.
[00:11:55] So again, think about this.
[00:11:57] Our rates are what in the sixes right now,
[00:11:59] understood that, you know, a 3% versus 6%
[00:12:02] is a punch to the gut for a lot of people.
[00:12:05] But because of that home pricing,
[00:12:08] some is you can negotiate better.
[00:12:10] So let's just use a million dollar home as an example
[00:12:13] in this environment with a 6% rate.
[00:12:15] You probably can get that home,
[00:12:17] we'll just say like for 900,000.
[00:12:19] Yeah.
[00:12:20] With rate start coming down and you're now approaching
[00:12:23] five or four, the demand in the market
[00:12:26] is going to be so great because everyone's going to be
[00:12:28] after that million dollar home.
[00:12:30] Like, oh great, the rates just went down 1%.
[00:12:33] Now they may over bid for that home, right?
[00:12:36] So now you as a buyer, a consumer,
[00:12:38] you're going to be in multiple offer situation on that home.
[00:12:41] The price is probably going to get driven up on that home.
[00:12:44] So instead of taking it at 900,000 at a 6%,
[00:12:48] you may be in a position,
[00:12:50] you know, or you might be buying it for 1.1
[00:12:53] with a 5% in so you start looking at the numbers,
[00:12:57] you know, and at the end of the day,
[00:12:59] sometimes they do even out,
[00:13:00] but at least you've got the home.
[00:13:02] Exactly.
[00:13:03] And when the rates come down,
[00:13:05] you can refinance that home.
[00:13:07] But you know, again,
[00:13:08] if you're, I always think of like,
[00:13:10] this has always been a mystery to me,
[00:13:12] and I'm the type of consumer that if I want something
[00:13:15] and it's within my price range or within reason,
[00:13:18] a reasonable price, I'll just buy it or I'll get it.
[00:13:22] Right?
[00:13:22] I've had buyers that, you know,
[00:13:25] they want to argue over the last $25,000,
[00:13:28] you know, and a million dollar transaction.
[00:13:29] I'm like, this is your home.
[00:13:31] This is where your kids are being raised, you know,
[00:13:34] this is where memories are being made.
[00:13:36] Is that $25,000 amortized over?
[00:13:39] Really going to change, you know.
[00:13:41] Right, it's a $100 a month, maybe.
[00:13:44] 
[00:13:45] So, you know, to me, it's a conversation with your clients
[00:13:48] of, you know, what's important to them?
[00:13:51] And if they truly, you know, feel like I don't want
[00:13:54] to lose this rate and I'm going to live in a house
[00:13:56] that I'm not happy in and whatever,
[00:13:58] you know, honestly, that's their choice.
[00:14:00] But again, as an advisor, we are here just to kind of broaden,
[00:14:05] you know, their thinking of, you know,
[00:14:08] don't look very short-sighted in this.
[00:14:09] This is a long-term, you know, play, especially if,
[00:14:12] you know, you're buying a property at a price
[00:14:16] that you have room to grow in that meaning, you know,
[00:14:19] if you buy it at 900 and, you know,
[00:14:21] we're seeing an upward trend in that neighborhood,
[00:14:23] you know, buy it now.
[00:14:25] And if you were to move in five to seven years,
[00:14:26] you're going to make a healthy gain on it.
[00:14:28] So again, that's where we, as real estate agents,
[00:14:32] really need to put on our hat as advisor and let them know.
[00:14:34] Oh, yeah, I think there's so much opportunity.
[00:14:37] And by the way, like I live actually in one
[00:14:39] of Carrie's developments, I love,
[00:14:41] this is like my favorite place I've ever lived.
[00:14:43] It's unbelievable.
[00:14:44] For those of you in Chicago, it's called Alcove.
[00:14:47] If you want to check it out,
[00:14:47] it's really just an unbelievably great little gem
[00:14:50] here in Wicker Park.
[00:14:52] I don't want to leave it because I love it.
[00:14:54] And I need a bigger place and I need to go out,
[00:14:57] unfortunately, I have to leave the city to go to the suburbs.
[00:15:01] But I'll get a bigger place.
[00:15:03] I'll be able to raise a child, you know,
[00:15:04] all that stuff with my, you know, soon to be fiancee.
[00:15:08] So we're having to make that plan.
[00:15:10] And so I have this double way.
[00:15:12] I mean, if I don't want to give up this great rate
[00:15:13] and this great place,
[00:15:15] but it's much smarter for me to do that now
[00:15:18] versus wait for rates to drop three times
[00:15:22] as many buyers flood the market.
[00:15:23] Yeah, there'll be more listings too,
[00:15:25] but there'll be much more competition.
[00:15:27] People will get emotional because they've been waiting
[00:15:29] to make a buy decision and things will just,
[00:15:32] prices will explode, I think.
[00:15:33] And so I don't want that to happen.
[00:15:35] And so as the saddest I will be to say goodbye
[00:15:37] to this amazing place, it's, you know,
[00:15:40] it's done great for me.
[00:15:41] I got five good years out of it.
[00:15:43] I mean, that's, that's a great thing.
[00:15:44] And I think having these conversations with sellers
[00:15:47] is like, let's just talk about what does happen
[00:15:50] if rates come down 1%.
[00:15:52] Like there's data.
[00:15:53] You can show them Lawrence Yoon National Association
[00:15:56] of REALTORS Chief Economist.
[00:15:57] He actually has data on this that this is what is predicted
[00:16:01] and if rates come down and it is not what you want
[00:16:04] as a buyer, like it is just not.
[00:16:06] So I think there's a huge opportunity
[00:16:08] to start talking to people who do want to make a move
[00:16:10] within the next two to three years and say,
[00:16:12] maybe it's maybe now is the time.
[00:16:14] And let's talk about what it'll look like
[00:16:16] in a couple of years when rates may possibly do come down.
[00:16:19] I agree.
[00:16:20] Yeah.
[00:16:20] And also too, I love the fact that you're having
[00:16:24] such a great year, the best year ever,
[00:16:26] because we are hearing so much, so much challenge
[00:16:29] in this market.
[00:16:30] There's just so many people complaining
[00:16:32] and I understand that.
[00:16:34] There's a lot of challenge for sure.
[00:16:36] Our agents are experiencing it as well
[00:16:39] and agents all over.
[00:16:40] But it's also great to hear like somebody
[00:16:42] who expanded within her own market.
[00:16:45] And you are now maybe the most well-known agent possibly
[00:16:49] in all of Chicago or certainly right at the very,
[00:16:52] very short list at the top of the mountain people know you.
[00:16:56] And it's not because you also went to Florida
[00:16:59] and Arizona and Colorado and other places
[00:17:04] that you could have easily gotten a reciprocal license for
[00:17:07] and just Wisconsin even.
[00:17:09] You could have gone up there in Indiana, right?
[00:17:11] You could do those things.
[00:17:12] They're very close by and you still chose to stay here.
[00:17:16] And I think that's a great sort of message
[00:17:19] for everyone listening is go deep.
[00:17:21] Get involved with your community.
[00:17:23] Be with the Chamber of Commerce.
[00:17:26] Go to all the events, let everybody know who you are
[00:17:28] and that you serve their community
[00:17:30] and that you're here to serve them.
[00:17:32] And then wait 20 years, Kerry did
[00:17:35] and you still have the best,
[00:17:37] I mean you've had amazing years every year basically,
[00:17:40] but you still do the same things you were doing
[00:17:42] when you first started, which I always find so fascinating.
[00:17:45] It's like that's the top agents I talk to.
[00:17:47] They all say that.
[00:17:49] They'll go, I still make my dials every day.
[00:17:50] I prospect, I serve my clients.
[00:17:56] It's kind of just the way of the world I guess.
[00:17:58] You just have to do the hard work.
[00:18:00] Well, what a great, great short lesson for us today.
[00:18:04] Everybody I want, by the way, Kerry also needs,
[00:18:07] she said earlier, she has people that she services that leave
[00:18:10] and go elsewhere.
[00:18:11] So she's always looking to expand her partnerships as well.
[00:18:15] So if you're an agent you think would be a good match,
[00:18:17] certainly reach out to her,
[00:18:18] Kerry McCormick real estate on social or on Instagram
[00:18:20] and you can find her everywhere, just Google her.
[00:18:22] She's super easy to find, has everything really accessible.
[00:18:26] And do check out her Instagram.
[00:18:28] It'll give you some great ideas of what a real luxury agent does
[00:18:32] with respect to showcasing properties.
[00:18:35] And it's so, it really does look just ultra professional
[00:18:39] and also really fun as well.
[00:18:41] So check that out.
[00:18:42] And on behalf of Kerry and myself,
[00:18:44] thank you for everyone.
[00:18:45] This is now our seventh year of doing
[00:18:47] the podcast.

And now, onto our show. Today's episode is brought to you by corded.io. Are you looking for agents to join your brokerage or team? Now, as a real estate recruiter, I can tell you the answer is always yes. But most agents aren't looking to move right now. So how do you know who to contact? Well, what if I were to tell you there's a recruiting and retention tool powered by artificial intelligence that shows you exactly which agents in your local market are looking to leave their brokerage right now and which agents at your own firm are also looking to leave you. Now, I've been recruiting REALTORS for 15 years and I've hired over 2000 agents. I can tell you with no exaggeration, this is the tool I've been waiting for. Corded's AI looks for trends across dozens of variables for each agent in your market and shows you which agents they believe are likely to move. Not only does it do that, but corded's AI went and visited my recruiting website and read everything I offer. So now when I'm recruiting, corded's AI tells me exactly what to say based on that agent's needs and what my brokerage can offer. It even writes emails for me. I've never seen anything like it and I use it every single day. Now, if you are looking to grow your brokerage, corded.io is the best tool out there. Visit corded.io to schedule a demo again. That's corded.io and now onto the show. Now, Hey, welcome to Keeping It Real, the largest podcast made by real estate agents and for real estate agents. My name is DJ Paris. I am your guide and host through the show today as our monthly series. I think this is our fifth or sixth straight year of doing this. This called the Monday Market Minute with Carrie McCormick from the Carrie McCormick real estate group here in Chicago with at properties, a Christie's International. A Carrie is a top top top top 1% producer here in Chicago with over 20 years of experience, helping buyers, sellers and investors. She is a true superstar and expert in everything from first time home buyers, veteran investors and especially luxury properties. She also works with a lot of developers and is often chosen to represent their high end developments. I want everybody to follow Carrie on Instagram because she is an amazing model of what you can do with your own Instagram account. She does it all herself. It is truly remarkable. It's probably the best looking Instagram account I've ever seen for REALTOR. So that's Carrie McCormick real estate and two season McCormick will have a link to that in the show notes. Carrie, welcome once again. Wow, I love that introduction. So thank you for that. Well, we're too humble to say, but this is possibly, you're on pace for this to be your very best year ever. And I have yet to hear anyone in 2025 say that. So congratulations. Oh, well, I love that. Yeah, and actually, that's kind of a little bit about what I wanted to talk about. I have been a broker in Chicago for this stills with the same two decades. Wow, right? So over 20 years. But through that 20 years, I've been working extremely hard, extremely focused on my business and just how I wanted to frame it. And you're right. This year, we're mid-Word July, at the end of July 2025. And I am at $250 million. Wow. Closed and pending. So I've got about $195 closed and then another little over 50 pending to close. And I've got fill in my pipeline for the rest of the year. So I'm hoping to break 300, which again, keep in mind, I do not have a big team. I am a solo agent. I have support staff underneath me. But it took, again, years to build and form what I wanted to create. And one of those things is staying local. So through the pandemic, especially here in Chicago for those real estate agents from Chicago or some of the Midwest states, everyone started moving to Florida, Arizona, Colorado, which is fabulous and great. And a lot of agents spread their wings and said, OK, I'm going to open up an office in Florida, in Arizona, wherever, in Colorado, et cetera. And I think as much as I wanted to do that, because I love those markets and to be able to service my clients, I decided that I am going to stay local. I say, I'm going to stay in my lane. And because of that, I put the puddle to the metal. I over-marketed during that time. And I ended up dominating the market here in Chicago. Because again, everyone was outspwriting their wings, a little bit trying to service and take advantage of other hot markets, which people did. And it was great. So nothing against that. But I wanted to stay hyper local and have that approach. But I did want to say or have some national and international network, too, right? Because when you're building trust with high network clients, you want to deliver global reach. And I didn't want to leave my city. So I am with Christie's International. I have an incredible network of brokers, nationally and internationally. So when one of my clients says to me, we're moving to Paris, we're moving to Colorado. Wherever they're moving to, I say, that's amazing. I'm going to sell your property here. I'm not an expert in Colorado using this example. But I have a trusted advisor and partner there that I'd love to introduce you to. So you just do that handoff. And obviously you take a referral fee. So again, I'm servicing my clients. I'm giving them the best service by giving them someone who's also an expert in that. So think about this. So again, there's this idea when you grow, you have to scale wide. But instead of thinking of going wide, think about going deep within your market. And when you're dealing with your clients, and everyone knows this, they can sense your confidence. They can sense what you're talking about when you know the market. And you just really can't fake that stuff. You have to be ingrained in your market. And people feel it. If I'm trying to make up something, which I don't do, but if you're stumbling with something, your clients can feel that. And they know when you're in your zone and when you're out of your zone. So I think that was super key to me growing my business. And again, 2025, being at the point where I am, because again, I advertised I marketed the heck out of me being local here and the expert in the market. I think too, for those of us that aren't quite at the level where we would think about expanding into another city, the same idea applies to expanding within your own city. And really thinking small and thinking, okay, yes, maybe there's other parts of my suburbs or the city or my neighborhoods that I really service. That yeah, I'd love to expand and be everywhere. But particularly, could I really provide, especially here in Chicago, we have so many different markets here. You couldn't be an expert in all, even all of the ones here. And as a result, it always makes sense, in my opinion, to like you said, go narrow, but go deep within that narrow focus. Like I always think there was, you know, I'm sure Michael Rosenblum, he's an agent here in Chicago. He did some very smart, many, many, many years. I don't know if he still does this, but he used to call himself Mr. River North, because he was, That's right. Basically, yeah, we're sort of laugh about it, but it was really smart because he did River North. And like when you River North, you were like, oh, Michael Rosenblum, he's Mr. River North. And he did probably more deals there than anyone during my period. And that's all he did. And it was like, he's in Gail Spring does Streeterville. There are people that, you know, yeah, you do things a little bit outside of your market from time to time when you can, but really, really smart. And you know, we think about this like with recruiting. We often think, well, what state should we go to next at Kale? And it's like, there's 43,000 agents here in Chicago. We only have 700 of them. Like we don't have that many. And you know, at properties, Christie's you guys have probably three to 4,000. You guys don't even have that many. And you're like, this firm. So there are so much opportunity here locally, whether, you know, and it's about like you said, going, going really deep. And again, also like with the best possible experience for the client, well, if you get your reputation, it isn't to try to get licensed in Colorado and then do a deal in Aspen. And unless you live there half the year, maybe, you know, but you're not, you're best off handing it to somebody. And that's something that, you know, we really should think about, we get a deal. And maybe it's just a little bit in a neighborhood or an area that we don't know. And we want to do the deal because that's a lot of money. But if it's something that we truly can't, can't really service to the degree that we owe to the client, you're a fiduciary. Like your job is to get them the highest price or the lowest price if you're buying. And if you feel like you can't do that way better to get somebody that absolutely knows that market. And what's really cool too is chat GBT will literally tell you like you could go in. It's not always accurate. But you could say who sells the most homes in this neighborhood or who's, you know, has the most buy side deals or whatever it might be. And you'll get some, or just, you know, call up your local aboard and ask them and they can run those numbers for you. And you can find really good people. And I think that's really smart. And again too, I just, I wanted to ask Keri, you something because you're doing so many deals. You do a lot of listings. I am, and you do a lot of everything, but a lot of listings. And right now I just hear people consistently saying, gosh, you know, all my buy, my sellers are locked into a 3% mortgage. They don't need to move. They don't want to move. They don't want to give up that 3%. Well, I'm actually going to be moving shortly. I don't want to give up my 3% but I'd rather give it up and not have a lot less competition on the buy side. Right. Right now. And so I'm curious like what do you say to sellers who are like, yeah, I guess I could sell now, but I just don't want to give up that rate. Yeah. Well, I mean, obviously we've got to follow their lead, but sometimes you don't have to look just macro, you know, of or micro into like what that rate is. If you're really unhappy in your home or the space that you're in, but you're staying there because of the interest rate, I always think that that's a bad idea. So again, think about this. Our rates are what in the sixes right now, understood that, you know, a 3% versus 6% is a punch to the gut for a lot of people. But because of that home pricing, some is you can negotiate better. So let's just use a million dollar home as an example in this environment with a 6% rate. You probably can get that home, we'll just say like for 900,000. Yeah. With rate start coming down and you're now approaching five or four, the demand in the market is going to be so great because everyone's going to be after that million dollar home. Like, oh great, the rates just went down 1%. Now they may over bid for that home, right? So now you as a buyer, a consumer, you're going to be in multiple offer situation on that home. The price is probably going to get driven up on that home. So instead of taking it at 900,000 at a 6%, you may be in a position, you know, or you might be buying it for 1.1 with a 5% in so you start looking at the numbers, you know, and at the end of the day, sometimes they do even out, but at least you've got the home. Exactly. And when the rates come down, you can refinance that home. But you know, again, if you're, I always think of like, this has always been a mystery to me, and I'm the type of consumer that if I want something and it's within my price range or within reason, a reasonable price, I'll just buy it or I'll get it. Right? I've had buyers that, you know, they want to argue over the last $25,000, you know, and a million dollar transaction. I'm like, this is your home. This is where your kids are being raised, you know, this is where memories are being made. Is that $25,000 amortized over? Really going to change, you know. Right, it's a $100 a month, maybe. So, you know, to me, it's a conversation with your clients of, you know, what's important to them? And if they truly, you know, feel like I don't want to lose this rate and I'm going to live in a house that I'm not happy in and whatever, you know, honestly, that's their choice. But again, as an advisor, we are here just to kind of broaden, you know, their thinking of, you know, don't look very short-sighted in this. This is a long-term, you know, play, especially if, you know, you're buying a property at a price that you have room to grow in that meaning, you know, if you buy it at 900 and, you know, we're seeing an upward trend in that neighborhood, you know, buy it now. And if you were to move in five to seven years, you're going to make a healthy gain on it. So again, that's where we, as real estate agents, really need to put on our hat as advisor and let them know. Oh, yeah, I think there's so much opportunity. And by the way, like I live actually in one of Carrie's developments, I love, this is like my favorite place I've ever lived. It's unbelievable. For those of you in Chicago, it's called Alcove. If you want to check it out, it's really just an unbelievably great little gem here in Wicker Park. I don't want to leave it because I love it. And I need a bigger place and I need to go out, unfortunately, I have to leave the city to go to the suburbs. But I'll get a bigger place. I'll be able to raise a child, you know, all that stuff with my, you know, soon to be fiancee. So we're having to make that plan. And so I have this double way. I mean, if I don't want to give up this great rate and this great place, but it's much smarter for me to do that now versus wait for rates to drop three times as many buyers flood the market. Yeah, there'll be more listings too, but there'll be much more competition. People will get emotional because they've been waiting to make a buy decision and things will just, prices will explode, I think. And so I don't want that to happen. And so as the saddest I will be to say goodbye to this amazing place, it's, you know, it's done great for me. I got five good years out of it. I mean, that's, that's a great thing. And I think having these conversations with sellers is like, let's just talk about what does happen if rates come down 1%. Like there's data. You can show them Lawrence Yoon National Association of REALTORS Chief Economist. He actually has data on this that this is what is predicted and if rates come down and it is not what you want as a buyer, like it is just not. So I think there's a huge opportunity to start talking to people who do want to make a move within the next two to three years and say, maybe it's maybe now is the time. And let's talk about what it'll look like in a couple of years when rates may possibly do come down. I agree. Yeah. And also too, I love the fact that you're having such a great year, the best year ever, because we are hearing so much, so much challenge in this market. There's just so many people complaining and I understand that. There's a lot of challenge for sure. Our agents are experiencing it as well and agents all over.
