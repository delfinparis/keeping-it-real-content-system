[00:01:22] [♪ OUTRO MUSIC PLAYING [♪
[00:01:23] All right, Keeping It Real listeners,
[00:01:29] I always love being here with you.
[00:01:31] It's always fun for me.
[00:01:32] So today I wanted to talk about the importance
[00:01:34] of that about me video.
[00:01:36] Sometimes known as an introduction video,
[00:01:39] but broadly speaking, it means you are taking that opportunity
[00:01:42] to introduce yourself to potential clients,
[00:01:46] reintroduce yourself to your network, maybe you may switch,
[00:01:48] maybe you're in a different niche,
[00:01:50] maybe you're covering a different area.
[00:01:52] That about me video, I'm going to talk about why it's so important,
[00:01:55] it really is, and what you can do to make a really great one.
[00:02:00] So first I'll introduce myself, this is my about me part.
[00:02:04] I'm Kim Rikberg, I'm a former media executive.
[00:02:06] I spent 15 years in television, including Netflix and people.
[00:02:10] I worked at, I launched the first ever video unit
[00:02:13] for Us Weekly Magazine.
[00:02:15] And I also spent 10 years doing news and general lifestyle coverage.
[00:02:19] So that's a lot of real estate, finance, all that stuff.
[00:02:22] And what I love now is that I get to use all of my knowledge
[00:02:26] and all of my information that I've gleaned from my years in TV
[00:02:30] to now coach real estate agents and other self-employed professionals
[00:02:34] to teach them how to grow their business through video and marketing.
[00:02:39] And so today I'm going to be focusing on the about me video
[00:02:41] because I think it's super, super important.
[00:02:45] And one thing that I have coming up that I wanted to mention to you
[00:02:47] is I only once a year host a VIP real estate agent media day.
[00:02:54] And basically you don't have to write the script,
[00:02:56] you don't have to do anything, you just show up.
[00:02:58] I have my award winning crew, my cinematographer,
[00:03:02] my videographer, my editor, we have Heron makeup.
[00:03:04] And you come and we sit down and we film these beautiful videos for you.
[00:03:08] And not only are they beautiful, they're really impactful and effective.
[00:03:12] And they know how to showcase you as the thought leader in the industry that you are.
[00:03:17] It's in New York City and then we have an exclusive private invitation only dinner.
[00:03:21] So it's all really fun.
[00:03:22] They're all limited spots.
[00:03:24] And it's all that really fast last year.
[00:03:26] So if you're interested reach out to me now.
[00:03:27] And there's an extra bonus for keeping your real listeners.
[00:03:30] OK, I want to jump into all of what you need to be doing for this video.
[00:03:37] So basically when you're talking about doing about me video,
[00:03:40] what needs to go into it and why is it so important?
[00:03:42] So first of all, I think we all know.
[00:03:45] And if you hear a little bit of noise, it is my six year old son,
[00:03:48] who is a little bit home sick right now.
[00:03:50] But I'm really, you guys are very important to me.
[00:03:52] So I'm going to keep recording and he's going to kind of act as my lighting coordinator.
[00:03:57] Why it matters so much.
[00:03:59] So even though I love short form video, I teach people,
[00:04:01] I teach people all about how to message themselves through social media video
[00:04:06] and a lot of those videos are short.
[00:04:08] Maybe we're talking about 15 seconds or 45 seconds or a minute.
[00:04:14] Those are amazing.
[00:04:15] It is essential to be on social media video with those short form videos.
[00:04:19] However, I will say it is very, very important to have that video
[00:04:23] that has you driving the narrative.
[00:04:26] So when we think about social media, sometimes you look at someone's speed
[00:04:29] and there's a lot on it.
[00:04:30] When the great way it means they're doing a robust job at marketing.
[00:04:32] But there is also that place you want to step back and say,
[00:04:36] like, who is this person just like in a nutshell?
[00:04:38] If I'm considering working with them as an agent, what is it about them
[00:04:42] that I trust that I like that I feel like I want to work with them
[00:04:45] on this really big deal for me?
[00:04:48] So, and I also like to, I think, you know,
[00:04:52] if you're here, you're a bullish on video, but I'm going to reiterate
[00:04:54] that showcasing your voice in your personality is unparalleled.
[00:05:00] So a photo, I'm sorry, no offense at everybody,
[00:05:02] but those like photos, those headshots, they're two-dimensional,
[00:05:05] one-dimensional.
[00:05:06] I'm not great with math and science, but they're flat, right?
[00:05:10] A photo and a little bit of text will never be able to compete with a video.
[00:05:14] This is the reason why TV and movies do so well.
[00:05:18] It really gets to showcase your personality, your emotionality,
[00:05:21] your building a relationship.
[00:05:23] You know this, I'm not teaching you this.
[00:05:24] You're building these relationships.
[00:05:26] So the importance of building that about me video is you're not just giving
[00:05:29] them information, but it's a part of the relationship you're building with those clients.
[00:05:33] Nothing compares to hearing you and seeing you.
[00:05:37] So that's just about like why it's important.
[00:05:40] Even if you're nervous, I do like to really flag a lot of people come to me.
[00:05:43] It's like a mix.
[00:05:44] Some people come to the video for a long time.
[00:05:46] Others only do it sometimes.
[00:05:47] They feel a little nervous about it.
[00:05:49] Even if you're nervous, even if you're nervous,
[00:05:52] this about me video is super, super important.
[00:05:55] But as I mentioned, I have that VIP day where I will direct you.
[00:05:58] And I'll make sure you're not nervous because I always make it fun.
[00:06:00] But as a part of this about me video, I think it's super, super important.
[00:06:04] I'm going to go through the things about what you should include,
[00:06:08] what you should include in the video.
[00:06:10] So I have a thing called the ABC method.
[00:06:14] This is what I consider the essentials for an elevator pitch.
[00:06:18] And it's perfect for this about me video as well.
[00:06:21] So the ABC.
[00:06:22] So A, and don't do it in this order.
[00:06:25] Don't do it in this order.
[00:06:26] Make it your own.
[00:06:26] When you look at it about me video, often it's shot.
[00:06:30] It's shot to look pretty.
[00:06:32] Maybe there's some footage of you walking along the street.
[00:06:35] Maybe footage of you in your office.
[00:06:36] Doesn't need to go in this order, but these things need to be in it.
[00:06:40] So A is for accomplishments or credibility.
[00:06:44] This is crucial.
[00:06:46] So many people I work with do not really make people know.
[00:06:50] This is why I'm credible.
[00:06:52] And these are the things I've done.
[00:06:54] I don't know if it's that we're self-conscious.
[00:06:56] I do know because actually I do a lot of these workshops.
[00:06:58] And I ask people what they struggle with with bragging and bragging.
[00:07:02] I call it bragging.
[00:07:03] What they struggle with with announcing their accomplishments.
[00:07:05] And a lot of people worry they're going to sound bragging
[00:07:07] or they're going to sound like they're trying to make other people
[00:07:09] feel bad about themselves.
[00:07:11] But I want to step back.
[00:07:13] When you're saying your accomplishments, your credibility,
[00:07:16] why people should trust you, you could just
[00:07:19] think of it as a data point.
[00:07:20] It's just a fact, right?
[00:07:22] Someone I did a workshop with, they were like,
[00:07:24] it's not bragging if it's a fact, bravo.
[00:07:26] It's not bragging if it's a fact.
[00:07:28] So what sort of accomplishments for credibility can you bring?
[00:07:30] Those can be any awards you've gotten.
[00:07:34] Certifications, degrees.
[00:07:36] A lot of times my agents have things in their background
[00:07:39] that I think also are involved.
[00:07:42] Like maybe they were in the past life, past career in finance
[00:07:47] or they were in design, negotiations, things like that sales,
[00:07:51] anything like that that kind of advances
[00:07:52] to someone to understand where you come from.
[00:07:54] I have one of my agents.
[00:07:55] He's an amazing marketer.
[00:07:57] We've leaned into that.
[00:07:58] Like being an amazing marketer and an agent, super important.
[00:08:02] So really including what you've done that is noteworthy.
[00:08:07] And sometimes people feel like, oh, I don't
[00:08:08] have any big awards.
[00:08:09] Like you've probably something, right, in your local area
[00:08:13] or in your office, something that stands you out,
[00:08:16] whatever percent agent you are, maybe you're a silver,
[00:08:19] a bronze, a gold in your neighborhood, anything like that,
[00:08:21] that stands you apart.
[00:08:23] I don't love just like, hi, I'm Jane Doe
[00:08:27] and I'm a real estate agent based in Ohio.
[00:08:29] Okay, like there's a lot of people doing that.
[00:08:31] Like really show me why you're different
[00:08:32] and why you're credible.
[00:08:34] So after we have the A, the A for accomplishments,
[00:08:37] which is built in with credibility, we have B for business.
[00:08:41] This is gonna sound obvious, but a lot of times
[00:08:42] people aren't really specific with what they're doing
[00:08:45] in their business.
[00:08:46] So that means not just saying you're a real estate agent,
[00:08:48] but if there's a specific area you cover as a real estate agent,
[00:08:52] that's a great time to mention that.
[00:08:53] So whether you focus on first time home buyers,
[00:08:56] new developments, anything that really can let someone know
[00:09:00] if you are the right fit for them.
[00:09:02] That's some of this is really letting people know
[00:09:04] that you are a good match for them
[00:09:06] because it's kind of matchmaking, right?
[00:09:09] So business is really highlighting
[00:09:10] what area you're an expert in.
[00:09:14] Now the last part is confidence.
[00:09:16] And so A, accomplishments, E, business,
[00:09:18] C, confidence and creative.
[00:09:20] So confidence, I think this one,
[00:09:22] sometimes it could sound a little bit obvious,
[00:09:24] but I cannot tell you enough
[00:09:26] that sometimes people they feel nervous
[00:09:28] and they put that on camera.
[00:09:29] You have to, figuratively make it.
[00:09:31] You have to show up with a big smile
[00:09:33] and feel super amazing.
[00:09:34] And again, this is all about finding the right situation
[00:09:37] to film in.
[00:09:38] I do not recommend filming this type of content
[00:09:41] on your iPhone, okay?
[00:09:42] My son is like literally sneaking up beside me.
[00:09:44] I cannot stress enough that you should not film
[00:09:49] this on your iPhone.
[00:09:50] This is a sort of video that you should let someone know
[00:09:52] visually, hey, I am investing in myself
[00:09:56] and investing in my business
[00:09:59] because I am this level of agent, right?
[00:10:01] So I think that there's plenty of time
[00:10:03] to be making that social media video
[00:10:05] that you use your iPhone and that's great
[00:10:06] and that will fill up your Instagram, your YouTube time.
[00:10:09] This video that can go on your website,
[00:10:11] it can go on your newsletter,
[00:10:12] it can get cut up for social media.
[00:10:14] This is the sort of video that you should spend the money for.
[00:10:18] Like it is an important piece
[00:10:19] because you get to tell the story.
[00:10:21] Additionally, if you shoot it right,
[00:10:23] which on my shoot day, you leave not only with one video
[00:10:25] but you leave with like 10 short clips as well.
[00:10:28] So from that video,
[00:10:30] you can create a lot of other short social assets.
[00:10:32] Okay, the last thing I wanna say about confidence
[00:10:35] and creativity in the sea is remember
[00:10:38] we're building those relationships.
[00:10:39] We talked about that earlier.
[00:10:41] So the second sea of confidence is creativity.
[00:10:43] This is a time to kind of bring in a fun fact about yourself
[00:10:48] and let people know something you can talk to
[00:10:50] about beside your business, right?
[00:10:52] Sometimes people are like,
[00:10:53] you post all this stuff on social media
[00:10:55] and it's like all business, which is good.
[00:10:57] But sometimes you wanna let people know you as a person
[00:10:59] a little bit because you're building those relationships.
[00:11:02] So I like to say when I introduce myself to people,
[00:11:06] sometimes that I backpack for a year.
[00:11:09] I took a gap year after college
[00:11:11] or I used to do improv comedy
[00:11:14] or that I used to have a jewelry business.
[00:11:17] All of those are like interesting facts
[00:11:19] that if someone likes that type of thing,
[00:11:20] if they like to travel or they like art or jewelry,
[00:11:22] that gives them something to talk about with me.
[00:11:25] And then the last thing I forgot to say earlier,
[00:11:26] I apologize, when we're talking about accomplishments
[00:11:29] and credibility, it's not credibility,
[00:11:31] but a part of your job as an agent
[00:11:34] is related to be known as the go-to agent in your neighborhood.
[00:11:37] So what does that mean?
[00:11:39] That means being the expert
[00:11:40] and so you can build that into the video.
[00:11:42] So you can talk a little bit about what you love
[00:11:45] about your area and why you're so passionate
[00:11:47] about helping people find homes there.
[00:11:49] So I would fold that almost into the A of the ABC.
[00:11:52] Okay, so we have A accomplishments,
[00:11:54] accomplishments of credibility,
[00:11:55] B, your business, be specific about what you do
[00:11:58] and C, make sure you are confident
[00:12:01] and dipping in a little bit of creativity
[00:12:03] so people have something that they can grab onto
[00:12:05] and really talk to you about from that.
[00:12:09] Okay, if you have any questions,
[00:12:11] I love hearing from keeping it real folks,
[00:12:12] like I basically Instagram friends will still
[00:12:14] many of you know.
[00:12:16] And I've worked with a lot of you too as well.
[00:12:18] So a lot of the people who've been guests in the show
[00:12:20] have also been clients of mine.
[00:12:21] So find me on Instagram at Kim Ritberg.
[00:12:24] I have a free download you can grab from KimRitberg.com.
[00:12:28] And again, if you're looking to do that about me video
[00:12:31] without the stress, I'll direct you
[00:12:33] out my amazing team.
[00:12:34] We'll write your videos for you
[00:12:35] and you'll walk away not just with one amazing video,
[00:12:37] but three amazing hero big videos
[00:12:40] and like clips, social media clips for months.
[00:12:44] It's a really amazing beautiful shoot.
[00:12:46] We do in New York City.
[00:12:46] It's gorgeous, it's amazing.
[00:12:48] And then you can go off and see a Broadway show
[00:12:50] the next day.
[00:12:51] That's one of our agents here that last year actually.
[00:12:54] All right, so I am Kim Ritberg
[00:12:56] and I love helping you grow your real estate business
[00:12:59] with video.
[00:12:59] So make sure to reach out to me.
[00:13:00] I'm at KIM, R-I-T-T-B-E-R-G.
[00:13:04] And if you want to connect with me,
[00:13:06] just send me a message and say VIP day
[00:13:09] and we'll just hop on the phone.
[00:13:10] Have a great day.

So, and I also like to, I think, you know, if you're here, you're a bullish on video, but I'm going to reiterate that showcasing your voice in your personality is unparalleled. So a photo, I'm sorry, no offense at everybody, but those like photos, those headshots, they're two-dimensional, one-dimensional. I'm not great with math and science, but they're flat, right? A photo and a little bit of text will never be able to compete with a video. This is the reason why TV and movies do so well. It really gets to showcase your personality, your emotionality, your building a relationship. You know this, I'm not teaching you this. You're building these relationships. So the importance of building that about me video is you're not just giving them information, but it's a part of the relationship you're building with those clients. Nothing compares to hearing you and seeing you. So that's just about like why it's important. Even if you're nervous, I do like to really flag a lot of people come to me. It's like a mix. Some people come to the video for a long time. Others only do it sometimes. They feel a little nervous about it. Even if you're nervous, even if you're nervous, this about me video is super, super important. But as I mentioned, I have that VIP day where I will direct you. And I'll make sure you're not nervous because I always make it fun. But as a part of this about me video, I think it's super, super important. I'm going to go through the things about what you should include, what you should include in the video. So I have a thing called the ABC method. This is what I consider the essentials for an elevator pitch. And it's perfect for this about me video as well. So the ABC. So A, and don't do it in this order. Don't do it in this order. Make it your own. When you look at it about me video, often it's shot. It's shot to look pretty. Maybe there's some footage of you walking along the street. Maybe footage of you in your office. Doesn't need to go in this order, but these things need to be in it. So A is for accomplishments or credibility. This is crucial. So many people I work with do not really make people know. This is why I'm credible. And these are the things I've done. I don't know if it's that we're self-conscious. I do know because actually I do a lot of these workshops. And I ask people what they struggle with with bragging and bragging. I call it bragging. What they struggle with with announcing their accomplishments. And a lot of people worry they're going to sound bragging or they're going to sound like they're trying to make other people feel bad about themselves. But I want to step back. When you're saying your accomplishments, your credibility, why people should trust you, you could just think of it as a data point. It's just a fact, right? Someone I did a workshop with, they were like, it's not bragging if it's a fact, bravo. It's not bragging if it's a fact. So what sort of accomplishments for credibility can you bring? Those can be any awards you've gotten. Certifications, degrees. A lot of times my agents have things in their background that I think also are involved. Like maybe they were in the past life, past career in finance or they were in design, negotiations, things like that sales, anything like that that kind of advances to someone to understand where you come from. I have one of my agents. He's an amazing marketer. We've leaned into that. Like being an amazing marketer and an agent, super important. So really including what you've done that is noteworthy. And sometimes people feel like, oh, I don't have any big awards. Like you've probably something, right, in your local area or in your office, something that stands you out, whatever percent agent you are, maybe you're a silver, a bronze, a gold in your neighborhood, anything like that, that stands you apart. I don't love just like, hi, I'm Jane Doe and I'm a real estate agent based in Ohio. Okay, like there's a lot of people doing that. Like really show me why you're different and why you're credible. So after we have the A, the A for accomplishments, which is built in with credibility, we have B for business. This is gonna sound obvious, but a lot of times people aren't really specific with what they're doing in their business. So that means not just saying you're a real estate agent, but if there's a specific area you cover as a real estate agent, that's a great time to mention that. So whether you focus on first time home buyers, new developments, anything that really can let someone know if you are the right fit for them. That's some of this is really letting people know that you are a good match for them because it's kind of matchmaking, right? So business is really highlighting what area you're an expert in. Now the last part is confidence. And so A, accomplishments, E, business, C, confidence and creative. So confidence, I think this one, sometimes it could sound a little bit obvious, but I cannot tell you enough that sometimes people they feel nervous and they put that on camera. You have to, figuratively make it. You have to show up with a big smile and feel super amazing. And again, this is all about finding the right situation to film in. I do not recommend filming this type of content on your iPhone, okay? My son is like literally sneaking up beside me. I cannot stress enough that you should not film this on your iPhone. This is a sort of video that you should let someone know visually, hey, I am investing in myself and investing in my business because I am this level of agent, right? So I think that there's plenty of time to be making that social media video that you use your iPhone and that's great and that will fill up your Instagram, your YouTube time. This video that can go on your website, it can go on your newsletter, it can get cut up for social media. This is the sort of video that you should spend the money for. Like it is an important piece because you get to tell the story. Additionally, if you shoot it right, which on my shoot day, you leave not only with one video but you leave with like 10 short clips as well. So from that video, you can create a lot of other short social assets. Okay, the last thing I wanna say about confidence and creativity in the sea is remember we're building those relationships. We talked about that earlier. So the second sea of confidence is creativity. This is a time to kind of bring in a fun fact about yourself and let people know something you can talk to about beside your business, right? Sometimes people are like, you post all this stuff on social media and it's like all business, which is good. But sometimes you wanna let people know you as a person a little bit because you're building those relationships. So I like to say when I introduce myself to people, sometimes that I backpack for a year. I took a gap year after college or I used to do improv comedy or that I used to have a jewelry business. All of those are like interesting facts that if someone likes that type of thing, if they like to travel or they like art or jewelry, that gives them something to talk about with me. And then the last thing I forgot to say earlier, I apologize, when we're talking about accomplishments and credibility, it's not credibility, but a part of your job as an agent is related to be known as the go-to agent in your neighborhood. So what does that mean? That means being the expert and so you can build that into the video. So you can talk a little bit about what you love about your area and why you're so passionate about helping people find homes there. So I would fold that almost into the A of the ABC. Okay, so we have A accomplishments, accomplishments of credibility, B, your business, be specific about what you do and C, make sure you are confident and dipping in a little bit of creativity so people have something that they can grab onto and really talk to you about from that. Okay, if you have any questions, I love hearing from keeping it real folks, like I basically Instagram friends will still many of you know. And I've worked with a lot of you too as well.
