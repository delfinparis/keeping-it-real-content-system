[00:03:01] My conversation with the great Kelly Dugat.
[00:03:18] Today on the show, our guest is Kelly Dugat from the Gold Group with At Properties, Christie's

[00:03:26] Let me tell you more about Kelly.

[00:03:38] In her free time, she enjoys working out and trying new baking recipes.
[00:03:42] I'll have to talk to Kelly about this because my mom just gave me my first, I feel so
[00:03:47] embarrassed to say it at 47, and my mom gave me something.
[00:03:50] She just gave me my first sourdough culture.
[00:03:53] So I am now in the process of learning how to do all of them.
[00:03:56] 
[00:03:56] On the phone, of course, sourdough lover.
[00:03:57] Okay, we'll swap.
[00:03:59] We'll swap.
[00:04:00] I'm still learning how to feed it and what it all means.
[00:04:03] Anyway, but back to Kelly, we'll talk baking a little later.
[00:04:08] But whether you're buying selling or investing in real estate or if you need baking advice,

[00:04:36] I want you all to listen and subscribe.
[00:04:39] It is called REALTOR Talk with Steph and Kelly.
[00:04:42] You can find it anywhere podcasts are served.
[00:04:45] And yeah, Kelly, welcome to the show.
[00:04:47] Thanks for having me.
[00:04:48] I'm so excited.
[00:04:50] Yeah, I am.
[00:04:51] I can not believe that you are starting the sourdough life because I have so I have a
[00:04:55] plethora of information for you on that.
[00:04:58] Yeah.
[00:04:59] Well, I'd like my first one.
[00:05:01] I think my first one is going to be a regular sourdough loaf.
[00:05:04] And then I want to try a sourdough dark rye next.
[00:05:08] So those are all.
[00:05:08] And I just bought a Dutch oven because I know you're supposed to have a Dutch oven.
[00:05:13] So anyway, okay, but back to you.
[00:05:16] Well, yeah, yeah.
[00:05:18] So tell us more about you.
[00:05:20] So how did you get into real estate?
[00:05:23] You know, so I actually, so right out of high school, I started, well, I started working
[00:05:28] my first job ever was at a hair salon in Frankfurt, Jeffrey Lamort Salon, which was like the
[00:05:34] best first job ever.
[00:05:35] And I was, I started there when I was 16 and I went to beauty school and I kind of got
[00:05:40] to a point probably around like 25, 26 to where I just kind of felt like I needed something
[00:05:45] new.
[00:05:46] I kind of feel like I stopped growing and evolving in that sense.
[00:05:49] And I originally wanted to get into real estate for investing purposes.
[00:05:54] Like sure.
[00:05:55] To see where my career is now, I would have never in a million years then guess that it
[00:06:00] would be where it is now in a good way, obviously, because my family, I don't have anybody who
[00:06:05] was in real estate.
[00:06:06] I don't have, you know, an uncle or anything like that who had this real estate business.
[00:06:10] So it was very foreign to me.
[00:06:13] And so I was going to real estate school.
[00:06:15] I was working my old job and I told very select of my like hair clients at the time that
[00:06:20] I was going to be, you know, because I didn't really know what was ahead of it.
[00:06:23] I was crossing each bridge, little by little.
[00:06:26] And one of my clients, who I was putting his hair, his wife, Stephanie Campbell, he's
[00:06:31] like, wow, you know, she's trying to build a team out here.
[00:06:34] So I was just so I met with Stephanie for coffee and it like kind of is the rest of this
[00:06:38] history.
[00:06:39] And looking back, I'm like, I just am so blessed to fall into her lap.
[00:06:43] I like to say it because once I got into the business, I realized how much risk new
[00:06:48] agents are for signing with their own brokerage.
[00:06:51] Sure.
[00:06:51] Or, you know, committing to a team like I honestly had no idea about any of it.
[00:06:57] And I just kind of went with my butt and trusted Stephanie and I couldn't be more thankful
[00:07:02] because we don't operate that way.
[00:07:04] They got in like our team.
[00:07:06] I don't even like to say a team.
[00:07:07] It's truly a group.
[00:07:08] We just help each other.
[00:07:09] It's not like all those nightmare team stories that you hear and everything like that.
[00:07:13] So I kind of just, you know, Stephanie took me under her wing and the rest of history.
[00:07:18] Like now I'm producing like a full-time agent.
[00:07:22] That's all I do.
[00:07:23] And it's craziness, fire sellers, you know, some investing here and there.
[00:07:27] I originally wanted to do, but I'm definitely a thick of it of being a full-time agent now.
[00:07:33] And I couldn't be more, you know, grateful for how it all happened.
[00:07:36] And how many years now have you been in?
[00:07:39] This is my fifth year.
[00:07:40] Wow.
[00:07:41] So you are now coming out of the hardest part, which usually is those first three years.
[00:07:46] And things are probably starting to just work a little bit more smoothly.
[00:07:50] Is that kind of what's happening?
[00:07:52] Yes, it's always, it's more chaotic as the years go because you get more business.
[00:07:57] I actually was just saying that this morning, it's like, I think I just have to get used
[00:08:00] to always feeling like I have a to-do list that'll never be fully fulfilled.
[00:08:04] It'll be my to-do list.
[00:08:06] That's fulfilled for the things that we need to get done and the law is being scraggled.
[00:08:09] Or it's down there.
[00:08:10] So yeah, so I think that it was very, very hard in the beginning.
[00:08:14] And I, you know, I have a lot of credit to.
[00:08:16] I was still working part-time with my old job to help.
[00:08:20] And then of course, the help of my fiance, like being able to take that leap
[00:08:23] and go full-time was huge.
[00:08:25] And that was really the game changer for my business.
[00:08:28] Yeah.
[00:08:29] I, that is, that is amazing.
[00:08:32] I was thinking to you about you being a stylist before.
[00:08:36] Yeah.
[00:08:37] So it's funny here in Illinois, at least, that I don't know if this is the same across the country.
[00:08:42] But the number of hours that a stylist has to put in before they can actually start practicing
[00:08:49] is something like 12 or 1300 hours, right?
[00:08:52] Isn't it?
[00:08:52] Yes.
[00:08:53] So I, yeah, it's, I don't even know the full amount.
[00:08:55] But it took me a while because I did, I started in high school.
[00:08:58] So I had to go half day, high school, half day, beauty school.
[00:09:01] So it took me like all in all about a year and a half to complete.
[00:09:03] And then I had to do like, you know, a year internship at the salon too.
[00:09:07] So it was a lot to it.
[00:09:09] And I love doing here like I said.
[00:09:10] I just, I just stopped growing.
[00:09:12] And I, I will say you wouldn't guess it.
[00:09:14] But the people skills and the communication skills and the talking skills that I,
[00:09:19] that I took with me from doing here all those years and having that alone time and one on one
[00:09:24] face time.
[00:09:24] But the client has helped me tremendously in my real estate career.
[00:09:28] So I don't, I credit so much to that until thankful that I did that for all those years.
[00:09:33] Yeah.
[00:09:33] It's, it's funny.
[00:09:34] I was just, I was just getting my haircut recently.
[00:09:37] And somebody is, is make is in the process of going from being the person who washes hair
[00:09:42] to a full-time stylist.
[00:09:44] And he's been on that path for years.
[00:09:45] And he was telling me about the 1300 hours or whatever it is.
[00:09:49] And I said, you know, the irony of this is, you know, a haircut, I think my haircuts like
[00:09:54] 65 dollars, whatever it is.
[00:09:56] And, and, and you know, somebody has to do 13 hours or 1300 hours of training for that yet
[00:10:00] to get a real estate license in Illinois.
[00:10:02] You only need to do 75 hours.
[00:10:04] And that's incredible because that's not a 65 dollar haircut.
[00:10:07] That could be a six six hundred fifty thousand dollar haul.
[00:10:10] Right.
[00:10:10] Or 100 percent.
[00:10:12] And that's one of my biggest things is like, gosh, I do wish.
[00:10:15] I do wish it was just a little harder to get license.
[00:10:18] Yeah.
[00:10:18] Yep.
[00:10:19] I think, and I think right now with the changes that we're seeing from the NAR settlement,
[00:10:23] I think we're going to start seeing some agents who maybe, you know, aren't all that in the
[00:10:29] business as you were, you know, as we were talking before we went on, I think we're going to see
[00:10:34] some people exiting the business.
[00:10:35] In fact, we're already, we're already seeing that.
[00:10:38] And so I think the good agents really have nothing to worry about because there's just
[00:10:41] going to be more market share for them to gobble up.
[00:10:44] I agree.
[00:10:45] Yeah.
[00:10:46] So tell us a little bit about how you prospect.
[00:10:49] Because right now, you know, there's a lot of things we can't control.
[00:10:54] Obviously, inventory, interest rates, those are, those are well beyond our control.
[00:10:58] As much as we can try to, you know, persuade our clients that now is a good time to buy
[00:11:03] in a sense because, of course, when rates drop, everyone's going to flood the market with buyers.
[00:11:07] And of course, those prices are all going to jump up.
[00:11:11] But, you know, a lot of people just don't want to make any changes right now because they don't
[00:11:16] like that interest rate or they don't like the inventory that's out there.
[00:11:19] So there's a lot you can't control at the moment.
[00:11:22] But of course, there's a lot that you can control with your activities and your actions.
[00:11:26] So I would love to know what are you doing right now to stay busy, stay productive,
[00:11:31] just keep the business growing.
[00:11:33] You know, so I just, I really do focus on my clients in front of me.
[00:11:37] That is a big thing.
[00:11:38] And I, of course, it's natural that, you know, during the busier seasons,
[00:11:42] you're going to have the clients in front of you.
[00:11:44] And then in the more quiet times, you're going to have that time to maybe like, you know,
[00:11:48] call 50 people or do any of that thing.
[00:11:51] So when it comes to like prospecting, I, my thing always, I love to snow while off my lessons.
[00:11:56] I have one listing.
[00:11:57] That's what I am targeting that entire neighborhood.
[00:12:00] I'm going to send like we get brochures made for the listings.
[00:12:03] And usually with it selling in a day or two, I have 20 left over.
[00:12:06] So what I'll do is I'll look through that whole neighborhood and I'll see who's on the
[00:12:10] longest and who's probably most likely to sell.
[00:12:12] And I will send that brochure and say, Hey, I just sell your neighbor's house.
[00:12:16] This is an example of the marketing that I use.
[00:12:19] And kind of a little story as to selling their house.
[00:12:21] And it's, you know, just to make it more off that ticket, not just like, Hey,
[00:12:25] I'm trying to, trying to buy your house and that kind of thing.
[00:12:28] So I think snowballing off of your listings, that's always, that's always like a really big one for me.
[00:12:34] And when it comes to buyers, you know, I have my buyers all set up on Zad List,
[00:12:37] which I'm sure that you're aware of that platform.
[00:12:40] And it's great. It's just like this like inner portal that connects you with your clients.
[00:12:43] And we have like a little chat in there and sending properties back and forth.
[00:12:47] And when it comes to buyers, you know, facing those types of problems in the sense of like,
[00:12:52] okay, if interest rates are so high or prices are so high, because, you know, they are.
[00:12:57] And, you know, and it's one of those things, like you said, there's so many things you can't change.
[00:13:01] And I think getting them to see that helps a lot.
[00:13:04] And it's all comes down to your motivation.
[00:13:06] I mean, I tell my clients all the time, like, yeah, I know that you guys love that two and a half
[00:13:09] percent interest rate. But you have your third kid on the way. Are you going to put an addition
[00:13:12] on your townhouse or are you going to bust out of the scenes and be uncomfortable just to save
[00:13:16] that two and a half percent interest rate? Whatever way you want to do it, it's fine.
[00:13:20] That's your life, you know, but I think it's just like delivering them with the hard facts
[00:13:24] and saying you're always, you're always going to deal with a, I always think you're always
[00:13:27] going to deal with a brunt of a market. If you're going to be a seller in this market,
[00:13:31] you're going to sell high and you're going to be so happy.
[00:13:33] Well, when you put your buyer shoes on, you're going to be so mad.
[00:13:36] So which one do you want? Because you're not unless you're buying in two totally different
[00:13:40] markets, you're likely not going to get bold. So I tell my clients right now, you know,
[00:13:44] you're buying with higher interest rates and higher prices. So me personally, I'm seeing things
[00:13:50] still go really fast, but I'm not seeing the 20, 30,000 over asking like I was, when rates were
[00:13:55] two and a quarter. So I just think right now it's one of those things you have to be serious and
[00:14:00] motivated and you have to focus on what you can't change. Location, like layout, just those types of
[00:14:06] things and this isn't the market to get hung up on an ugly cabinet color. Those kinds of things,
[00:14:12] they just really narrowing down what's important to them. And a lot of times it's, I'm like,
[00:14:16] look, if you can squeeze out another year and that busted through the scene, sound home with that
[00:14:19] to an app, you know, see what happens. But if rates drop next year, it will be competitive
[00:14:24] because then we're at the inventory issue. So it's just like this vicious circle and people think
[00:14:29] that like it's going to be the best time to buy now. Whereas no one can time the market. It's
[00:14:34] all situational and to what you are looking for and what your lifestyle is, you know.
[00:14:40] I think, yeah, I think it's interesting. Like we're talking about feelings, like customer feelings
[00:14:45] and how feelings really ultimately most of the time, Trump logic, right? So even though,
[00:14:50] yeah, it's like, yeah, and it's just human nature that we were really driven by our feelings,
[00:14:57] kind of drive the bus more so than logic in certain situations. And buying a home being such a
[00:15:05] large price point for most families, most individuals, a lot of times the largest financial decision.
[00:15:11] I know when I bought my most recent kind of, it was the largest financial decision I'd ever made.
[00:15:15] And what's funny is I was telling Kelly before we started, I was like, I said, oh, I just bought
[00:15:21] a new car. And we were talking about it. And what I didn't mention that I think would be helpful to
[00:15:26] our audience is one thing that the salesperson who was very good said to me is when we were in the
[00:15:31] process of negotiating, which is always the worst part. Now, some people like that. I don't like it
[00:15:35] because it's just whatever. It just seems like a big cat mouse game. But anyway, eventually, we arrived
[00:15:41] at something that was reasonable. And she said something very smart to me. And this particular person
[00:15:47] is like the number one salesperson. They have 15 different dealerships. She's like the person I've
[00:15:52] got lucky and got her. And she said, here's the thing. You're going to walk out of here. And she's
[00:15:56] lovely. I really like her. She's like a good human being. I like her. I'd hang out whether I'd be
[00:16:00] your friend. But in that moment, we're sort of not adversaries, but we're certainly competing with
[00:16:05] each other to try to get the, I'm trying to get the lowest price. She wants the highest price.
[00:16:09] And she's like, look, no matter what number you end up, we end up deciding on, you're going to
[00:16:14] walk out of here. And you're probably going to feel like you got ripped off. She goes, that's
[00:16:18] totally normal. It happens to everybody. She said, if you feel that way and you wake up the next day
[00:16:25] and you feel that way, I want you to call me because I'll talk you through it. But I want to make
[00:16:29] sure that you're at least comfortable with this number right now because I know later it's
[00:16:33] it's going to come back to you and you're going to feel like, and I thought, boy, that was so smart
[00:16:37] because as I was leaving, that's exactly what happened. I'm like, I really liked her. And then I
[00:16:41] went, wait a minute, I just get ripped off. No, I didn't. But I didn't. But she was wise to say
[00:16:46] that. And I think I think agents would think would do well to think about, you know, hey, I know
[00:16:53] it can feel like now is not a good time. And here's why here's people who are making decisions now.
[00:16:58] Here's why they're making it. And here's how it's going. And, and, you know, but I think this idea
[00:17:04] of really explaining sort of, here's, here's the, I mean, because even in a great market, even in a
[00:17:09] time when they do get the price they want, at some point, they're going to freak out on the buy
[00:17:13] side at least at some point, they're going to have a moment, whether they share it with you or not,
[00:17:17] maybe just internalize it, but they're going to have a moment where they're like, oh my god, what am I
[00:17:21] doing? Right? Unless they're just a seasoned buyer and it's no big deal. For most of us, it's a big,
[00:17:26] big deal. So I love this, this idea of sort of coaching somebody through those feelings and
[00:17:32] feels like that, that's a big thing for you too. Oh gosh, I think educating and coaching, those
[00:17:37] are like probably the two main hubs of my business because I just think that it does make for such
[00:17:42] a smoother transaction and it makes for repetitive business and referrals and I really
[00:17:47] need heavily on my sphere and my friends and family. And I think if you treat your clients,
[00:17:53] if you give them the best service, they're going to do a lot of the marketing for you,
[00:17:57] truly. And I think that again, like I say, I snowball off my listings, I snowball off my clients.
[00:18:02] Like, of course, I want new clients, sure, but if I could get referrals to where I have a little
[00:18:07] bit of a connection, that's a little bit more of a solidified relationship and process for me.
[00:18:12] I would choose that all day long. So yeah, I think educating and coaching and the feelings part
[00:18:18] absolutely, I tell people all the time, I'm like, you're not going to wake off one day and feel like
[00:18:21] today is a great day to job 500 grand. Right. It's never a good day to do that. And also,
[00:18:27] too, when you say, like, people are like, okay, when I walk into the house, I'll just know what's
[00:18:31] the one. And I'm like, I don't think even I think there's always going to be a little bit of that
[00:18:36] double on your shoulder, reminding you of this is the biggest purchase that you've made in your
[00:18:41] life so far. So again, it is normal for nerves and everything, but you just have to, I always like
[00:18:46] to say, as a buyers agent, I like the best friend that knows every single bit of the process.
[00:18:51] That's your right hand man. I mean, truly, because it's like if we talked six months ago,
[00:18:56] and I knew everything that you were looking for, and I knew the price point and everything,
[00:19:00] and then six months later, we're there, and you have that feeling, I'm like, look, this is,
[00:19:03] this has been the goal. This is here. I mean, obviously, again, like it's going to be a lifestyle
[00:19:08] change, but again, we're not going 100 grand more than what you had originally said a couple of
[00:19:12] months ago. Like this is what you've been wanting. This is where, you know, we're here. We're here.
[00:19:17] And I think that you have the feeling of, okay, I don't want anyone else to have this house.
[00:19:22] I think that's more of a realistic way to put it versus walking in and being like, this is the one.
[00:19:28] That's interesting. I don't want anyone else to have this home. That's a really interesting phrase.
[00:19:33] I really very much like that. So I think that's a great tip for our listeners to consider saying to
[00:19:41] them, you know, as you're going through and evaluating these homes, you might have in aha moment,
[00:19:46] where you walk in and you're like, this is it. That happens once in a while, but I wouldn't count
[00:19:51] on that experience happening because there's, like you said, there's always a little bit of doubt
[00:19:55] that's going to come in. It's normal. It's human. It's totally, it's actually to protect you in case
[00:20:00] you're doing something totally reckless. So it's good to have that little, you know, second voice,
[00:20:04] saying, well, maybe you should think about this. But then, you know, maybe you could reinforce
[00:20:10] which way you want to go by saying, would I be okay with somebody else having this home?
[00:20:14] I love that. And if the answer is yes, then we move on.
[00:20:17] Right. And it's also true. The same thing in the sense of when you're multiple offers and they're like,
[00:20:22] they're offering, let's say, five, 50, and it should be good to five, 60. I'm like, you need to offer
[00:20:27] it at a price that you're okay with losing it at. So if you do five, 50 and someone wants to come in
[00:20:31] and pay five, 60 at your, your mindset should be let them, you know, like you, that's what you want to
[00:20:37] offer it that you're okay with losing it at. So it's all, it's, I feel like this job is just, it is
[00:20:42] very psychology. They very, how, how do you educate your clients again? Because if they have an
[00:20:48] agent who's not really given them much assurance and they're kind of wishy-washy or anything like
[00:20:53] that doubt is just going to like, you're going to be up all night and probably have cold buyer's
[00:20:58] seat because you just, you don't have that assurance because you're a brand new first time home buyer
[00:21:02] and you have no idea what you're getting into because, you know, you're not really getting that
[00:21:06] from your agent. I'd like to go back to the, that's really great point. I want to go back to the snowball,
[00:21:11] sort of situation that you have in specifically around when, when you sell a home that you look,
[00:21:18] you know, for neighbors who are, her nearby who are probably familiar with this property and say,
[00:21:23] hey, by the way, I just sold and you send them a brochure and a letter. Have you ever
[00:21:28] liked thought and again, I, I don't know if people do this anymore, but have you ever thought about
[00:21:33] going door to door being like, hey, just FYI, I sold so and so's how I'm just wanted to say hi or,
[00:21:38] to me, I don't know how easy that would be for me to do. I'm just asking because I know there are
[00:21:43] people that do that, but just curious if that's ever something you've tried. You know what? I,
[00:21:47] haven't, I would not be opposed though because I am much more of an in-person person than like,
[00:21:54] you know, it's, it's more part of like my well-oiled machine in the sense of, okay, I have a listing
[00:21:58] and I always do the brochures, but that's only like maybe like 15 or 20 of them. And then I'll do
[00:22:04] also like, you know, a mile radius of postcards. I have a QR code that will, you know,
[00:22:09] basically give them an estimated value of their property. And then I find out who scancels codes
[00:22:14] and then I will call and follow up. I do love the idea of going in person. Truthfully, I think at
[00:22:20] that point it would probably be a time thing. But yeah, no, I just usually always do the mail and,
[00:22:26] I mean, there is a little bit of an intimidating factor when it comes to door knocking. I don't,
[00:22:29] you know, it's the worst too. If like you, it, me and Stephanie had to do this, this food
[00:22:35] drive. So I was helping her. We were, you know, going door to door and all we were doing was leading
[00:22:39] bags on people's doors, not even raining doorbells. And the amount of times that I jumped because
[00:22:43] the dog just like, I don't know where, just because I was walking up to the house. I'm like, okay,
[00:22:48] I don't know. Like, you're nagging that much. Yeah. The, the, the only, the best way I've heard for
[00:22:53] people to do door knocking, because again, and also too, there's a safety consideration. And,
[00:22:58] and just, you know, sort of do people like getting their doorbell rang. I don't know. Right.
[00:23:03] But, but one way that I've seen it work is if there's an open house. So prior to the transaction
[00:23:10] closing, going around saying, Hey, just FYI, we're doing an open house at your neighbors with
[00:23:14] the Sunday. Feel free to swing by that kind of thing. Didn't mean to bug you. Just want to let you
[00:23:18] know you'll probably see me here on Sunday. If you want to swing on by it, everybody wants to see
[00:23:21] their inside of their neighbor's homes. Right. No, that's a great idea. And that is something
[00:23:26] that I'll do if I'm doing an open house. I will. Or one of my favorite things to do, actually,
[00:23:31] if it's a smaller neighborhood before we list because neighbors love to know this group. They love
[00:23:36] to know the end. So I will write a letter to the neighbors that says like, just to give you the
[00:23:41] courtesy, I, you know, I appreciate the coiteness of this neighborhood. And if you see someone
[00:23:45] usual traffic, it's because I'm listing your neighbor's house and that gets them. And then I'm like,
[00:23:49] if you know of anybody, if you have any friends or family who want to be your neighbor, let
[00:23:53] you know, and they call us like that. And they're like, oh, and you know, even if they don't have
[00:23:57] anyone, they're going to call me because they're interested in what's going out of their neighbor's
[00:24:00] house. So that's a really good one. I like to use if we have that time, like just say that we're
[00:24:05] prepping for photos or whatever it is. I always do that too. You know, that's, that's an amazing
[00:24:10] idea. So I'll tell you, I live in a condo building in the city. There's, I should know how many units
[00:24:15] there are. I don't know. I think let's say 40. I think there's 40 condos in our building. And
[00:24:19] we've had a few people. It's only three and a half years old. Actually, it was listed by
[00:24:23] Bikari McCormick, who's an app properties person. You're company. Anyway, and so a couple of
[00:24:31] these properties have sold since the original owners. I'm stolen original owner. And I have
[00:24:37] received exactly zero postcards, emails, texts. Now again, texts and emails. People won't get
[00:24:44] mailers. Anything saying what you just said, hey, just in case you didn't know one of your neighbors
[00:24:49] in the process of selling, if you'd like to have one of somebody you know, be your neighbor.
[00:24:53] I mean, think about how simple, like they could have literally just walked through our building
[00:24:57] and slipped it under. I put it on our door, a little postcard. It wouldn't cost anything. And I
[00:25:03] would love for somebody I know to be my neighbor. So this idea of what you just said is, is such a great,
[00:25:09] great idea. So for those of you who sound like you're doing them a favor, not doing them a favor,
[00:25:13] but like you're letting them in on the scoop. Exactly. Exactly. Because the only time, I mean, I don't,
[00:25:18] I don't monitor my building. So I don't know when people are buying and selling. The only time I
[00:25:22] know is when I see the delivery truck pull up, I'm like, I guess someone's moving out, moving in.
[00:25:26] And you know, in a kind of building, especially a smaller one, you do develop relationships with
[00:25:31] neighbors, not all of them, but some of them. And so it is kind of a bummer when somebody leaves,
[00:25:35] because you know, and so this idea of knowing that is really I'm sort of shocked. And I don't
[00:25:41] think it's because everybody knows that I'm in real estate. I don't think that's the reason I'm not
[00:25:45] getting the postcards. I think it's just nobody's doing it. And it's a really digital world.
[00:25:50] Sometimes I'm like, it's hard to mail the thing anymore, but how can I get it? Because I think that
[00:25:54] so much of it's lost in email. We have 800 agents at our company. And when we email them something
[00:26:01] we need from them, almost nobody pays attention to it. When we SMS them, when we send them a text,
[00:26:07] that's when they pay attention. And again, I know you can't really text strangers, you know,
[00:26:11] without their permission. But yes, emails get lost and forgotten about. I'm sure your company at
[00:26:17] properties has the same problem when they email all the agents saying, please do this, do that. And
[00:26:21] like nobody notices it. So this is yeah, so that's a great point. So in person face to face, voice
[00:26:27] to voice, those are going to be what when when the game and at least that I've seen. Let's talk a
[00:26:34] little bit more about marketing. So you're in your fifth year. When did it start? How many years in
[00:26:41] before the referrals started really flowing just to give our audience who maybe are, you know,
[00:26:47] they're newer to the business than you? When did it really start to click?
[00:26:51] So okay, so I got I got licensed in 2019. And so I feel like that. Honestly,
[00:26:59] well, so obviously I got I always say I had a very good combination of luck and timing and
[00:27:05] hard work, obviously, because 2019 I went into this completely zero experience, nothing. And I
[00:27:12] experienced the 2020 crazy COVID market. So it's like I started in like the craziest market,
[00:27:19] like running around like chicken with my head cut off. So 2020 I did decently good for being
[00:27:24] a new agent. It's not like I've killed it, but it was just, you know, the market was insane.
[00:27:28] And then 2021 I would say probably like my third year is when I was like, okay, I feel more like
[00:27:34] it's a well oiled machine versus me just constantly like waiting for where the next deal is going to
[00:27:40] come from. Whereas now and I yeah, I would say probably like my third year in is when I felt like,
[00:27:46] okay, I think I could make this work just doing this if I just continue to grow every year as I have.
[00:27:52] And just know that one of my favorite things, what real estate is that it truly, it just like fine
[00:27:57] wine, like you get better with yours. And you get better with experience like you yourself and
[00:28:02] your brain and everything. Also your reputation and also your experience like that is something I,
[00:28:08] I wish I would have known more as a new agent is like it's like a fine wine. It gets better in time.
[00:28:14] Whereas like my last job was something that in time, like you kind of, if you're in older
[00:28:19] hair styles and you're not really up with the trends, you know, you're not, it's just different in
[00:28:23] every aspect. Like and I bet one thing I love about real estate is that A, the sky is the limit and B,
[00:28:29] if you do it correctly and your reputation is good and you're a great agent, it only just
[00:28:34] gets better year after year after year. So I have a question. So when if you were to think back
[00:28:40] about your earlier self in real estate, when you first started, you didn't know what you know now,
[00:28:46] you know, you were probably there's anxiety around how am I going to pay the bills and build
[00:28:50] this into a business and you know, gosh, I don't have enough clients at the moment. And all of those
[00:28:55] sort of uncertainty feelings that happen to every single person who starts this business.
[00:29:00] What would you tell yourself to knowing what you know now? What would you tell your younger self
[00:29:05] to make that those those first two or three years, which were maybe not super comfortable?
[00:29:11] What might you say that would make it more comfortable?
[00:29:14] Honestly, and it sounds so cliche and obvious, but you get what you put in. And that's all I can
[00:29:19] say. And sometimes that might take a year or two years or three years, but like
[00:29:23] if you truly truly are dedicated and you put in the work, it will it will work out just with time.
[00:29:31] And if that's not working out, then I do your leadership around you. I I cut it so much of where
[00:29:38] I am to Stephanie and being having a good mentor from the start and a great brokerage from the
[00:29:43] start, I cut it so much today. So if you are in those beginning phases, you just see like nothing's
[00:29:47] working. Look around you because you are really surrounded yourself with. And you need a mentor and
[00:29:52] you need somebody because you could do your hours over and over and over again in school, but you
[00:29:57] really, in my opinion, don't learn anything until you are in the business. Yeah, mentorship is
[00:30:03] I can't think of anything more important for for a new age. Yeah, let's let's talk about let's talk
[00:30:09] about your your team because you know, there's lots of different teams and lots of different structures
[00:30:14] and some people have good experiences with teams and others feel maybe this isn't the right team for
[00:30:19] me. How did you know what advice would you have for somebody who is thinking about joining a team,
[00:30:25] but isn't quite totally sure if they should do it? I would say make sure that you just really learn
[00:30:33] as much as you can about that team before signing anything, I guess like even get to know
[00:30:37] what agents on that team go on their socials. I think you can I think you can know somebody to an
[00:30:42] extent on their social videos. You could at least get to know them somehow, some way. And I mean,
[00:30:47] of course, agents are going to want to look at like a split like my team visit work like that. That's
[00:30:51] what we call a group. It's not like because Kaelin Kaelin Goldstein and Stephanie Campbell are the
[00:30:56] team leads. So it's not like Kaelin and Stephanie are getting my production and I'm not like I have
[00:31:00] 100% of my production and it's not it's just such a black and white group of people who help other
[00:31:08] people and that's really all all it is. And I think that there's some people out there who we
[00:31:13] haven't had a bad taste in their mouth from teams that think ones like ours who we just help each
[00:31:17] other don't exist. We like to camaraderie and we like the gold group and it's just it's just fun.
[00:31:24] We all get together with our meetings that we share marketing ideas just like how you and I are
[00:31:27] doing and it helps build that momentum and it's nice because I have someone somewhere up like
[00:31:33] literally everywhere. If I have a city client where I don't really do too much in the city like hey
[00:31:38] that goes you know and I have someone northern western suburbs. So I love having everyone everywhere
[00:31:42] because if a client comes to me and it's not exactly an area that I work I can still help them
[00:31:47] and I still I still brought value to them by being like hey here's my team member Duval or Frankie
[00:31:52] or anything like that. But I think it's very important if you're not on a team have a mentor.
[00:31:59] Just be picky on that that's my biggest piece of advice is be picky and make sure that the agent
[00:32:04] cares and wants to help like I don't know don't go based on the leaves either my my theory on that
[00:32:10] is everyone is going if anyone gives you a lead they're not good ones it's always been always
[00:32:16] been like saying yeah but our team like we don't and we're we're honest about the
[00:32:22] interiors should say stuff being came in from the start we don't try and get people on our team
[00:32:25] and they will give you leads because it's not like that we always joke like BIOC for your own clients.
[00:32:31] Yeah and and what's mentorship should ultimately generate leads meaning the mentorship experience
[00:32:39] and the knowledge and the wisdom that you learn from these mentors should be the gateway for you to
[00:32:44] apply those those principles and those practices you know and that's what really is is to me the
[00:32:50] biggest benefit of joining a team is getting the wisdom and once you have the wisdom like you just
[00:32:55] point yourself in that same direction and apply the wisdom and the leads will eventually show up
[00:33:01] maybe not today maybe not tomorrow but within a year for sure and yeah so oh here's a question so
[00:33:07] when you're in the middle of working with lots of different clients at the same time which I'm sure
[00:33:11] you always are how do you continually think about I still need to be prospecting even though I'm
[00:33:16] slammed with business because this is a problem that agents often run into is they get bottlenecked
[00:33:21] meaning they have a bunch of clients that that happen it's kind of like with online dating too for
[00:33:26] those single people what happens if you're doing online dating you know you put all these requests
[00:33:30] and I like this person this person this person and then you hear nothing from any of those people
[00:33:34] and then all of a sudden like three or four of those people reply at the same time you're like oh boy
[00:33:38] now I have to talk to all these people and it becomes a little bit like OGs and and and then some of
[00:33:43] those people fall away and of course and the same sort of thing happens in real estate where
[00:33:46] you do all this marketing and then eventually you get some things that happen at once but then if
[00:33:51] you don't continually market that eventually when those transactions either fall away or close then
[00:33:55] you're back to zero so are you thinking about what can I do every day every week every month just to
[00:34:01] keep the marketing machine rolling oh this thing doesn't turn off BJ it's sometimes like I said
[00:34:08] that I find this happening today I'm like I just you know right now I am in the middle of
[00:34:14] eight or nine deals which is a lot for me being just a solo agent I don't have it I delegated my
[00:34:20] first thing which was just some just clothes and just listed posts for my socials just to
[00:34:25] take one thing off my shoulders a little bit of a control freak so that was a big step for me
[00:34:29] but I I need to because I do need to be more present with the clients in front of me but I
[00:34:35] have systems which I my brain works very good with systems like okay like I said I list a
[00:34:41] property and that's my I have that pre little mail to the to those neighbors and then I list the
[00:34:46] property and then I send the brochures and then I do the postcards that's my listing kind of thing
[00:34:51] and then I also do quarterly newsletters that I print out and actually send to my sphere it's
[00:34:56] about 300 people some people you know clients perspective clients everything of that nature and it
[00:35:02] has the market update it has recipes so that's something to stay in front of them hard paper wise
[00:35:06] every quarter so it'll be you know a winter one a spring one summer one fall one and also to I do
[00:35:12] home anniversary gifts so every year I switch that up so that way I'm at least staying in front
[00:35:16] of my past clients once a year and well technically five times a year because they get my newsletters
[00:35:21] four times a year so my goal is to just always stay in front of them because it also being just
[00:35:28] genuine like all my home anniversary cards it is a pain in the butt bringing out a nice you know
[00:35:32] message in a sharpie and I have like a key change just like do something different every year with
[00:35:37] them last year I just did like Starbucks gift cards just a five dollar coffee um and so I think those
[00:35:43] systems help me tremendously because I finally got them down to where I like don't have to wake up
[00:35:48] anymore and be like okay how am I going to um work on my business and not in my business today
[00:35:54] that kind of thing whereas my newsletters my home anniversary cards my my postcards just listed
[00:35:59] just sold all of those things are working on my business and it kind of you know I do those things
[00:36:04] and during the times that I'm not working in my business and sometimes that's a half day of
[00:36:08] designing my postcard and making sure that it's to my standards and then the other half is talking
[00:36:13] to clients and going and showing and doing all that um but yeah it is it's I would have never guessed
[00:36:20] what it would be like running your own business like this back when I started it just keeps on
[00:36:26] well let's talk about because you've been in this five years let's talk about what you
[00:36:30] dislike uh in being about being a REALTOR so what are what's hard for you or what do you wish
[00:36:36] would we're different um you know honestly and I think that brings up the the buyer broker with
[00:36:42] uh I mean our uh I think that the risk of potential time wasting is a big thing but that is
[00:36:48] without any commission sales job right um I think that's something that I you know dislike about
[00:36:53] the job and also too like I mentioned just some of some agents out there and there's not a lot it's
[00:36:58] not like I I have I'm so blessed about a lot majority of my deals I do know the agent on the other side
[00:37:04] and it's you know it's great but you do get those ones where it might be like you know Uncle Joe just
[00:37:09] has his license just for whatever reason and he's selling Aunt Sally's property and it's
[00:37:15] it's uh it's real estate is so you need to have the right people in place that you need to have
[00:37:20] the right team in place in order to like successfully and timely and efficiently get to the
[00:37:24] finish line of closing and when there's somebody on the other end who you can tell like doesn't care
[00:37:29] nothing and there's nothing to do about it because they have a they're getting paid whether or not
[00:37:34] I'm going to make the whole thing it all falls on me they're gonna still get there's always one
[00:37:39] agent that's gonna catch like a front of a lot of it usually when that happens so I guess the
[00:37:44] lack of discipline or I guess the lack of standards that they hold for realters I guess would be a good
[00:37:49] way to put it the time the time-lacing and just the potential because that could be something that's
[00:37:55] no one's fault they could be something that you spend a year showing someone houses and they
[00:37:59] just simply decide not to move what are you gonna do be like you know come after them for not wanting
[00:38:03] to move you know you just hope all you can do in those situations and this is what I tell myself
[00:38:08] to stay positive all you can hope is that they refer you so if you get them the experience even though
[00:38:13] they didn't close with you if you were at least professional and on time and you were educated on
[00:38:19] every date they're they're gonna still remember you so that's just that's the overlining I try to
[00:38:23] take with me after you know you get you get punched a couple times but yeah I would say that other than
[00:38:29] that I really do love my job um sometimes it is sometimes it is a lot though you know dealing with
[00:38:34] if I said in the middle like nine deals right now so everyone has a story everyone has a different
[00:38:39] place that they're going right everyone is like okay got to meet I got to be in here and then
[00:38:43] that's and it's a lot to juggle I wish I could just sometimes replicate myself
[00:38:49] but yeah I would say just the the craziness of it all I wish that there was a little bit more
[00:38:54] consistency in real estate but that's what makes it exciting is that it's just wild right now and
[00:38:59] who knows where it'll be in the fall winner right yeah and I'd love to get your thoughts on the
[00:39:04] NAR settlement which again we'll talk just specifically about buyer representation now of course
[00:39:10] buyer commissions are not guaranteed to be paid by the by the seller the list agent uh so uh of course
[00:39:16] buyer representation is now it's really critical to have those conversations around here's what I charge
[00:39:22] here's how we're going to we're gonna try to get it paid one way and then we may have to go a second
[00:39:27] way if that doesn't work um and I'd love to get your thoughts on how that's those conversations which
[00:39:33] you know for being totally frank and I'm not speaking for Kelly or about Kelly but let's be honest
[00:39:38] the vast majority of REALTORS used to not have those conversations with buyers because technically
[00:39:43] the buyers were cutting a check so it was it was just easier not to talk about it or to talk about it
[00:39:48] just kind of briefly and and you know this is probably why why they're the issue the issues
[00:39:54] we're having today but it's also the way the system was set up so it you know it was it was good
[00:39:59] for certain reasons and then maybe it wasn't great in other reasons for other ways but we're now
[00:40:03] in a situation where we do have to have those conversations you know with the buyer every single
[00:40:08] time and have them agree to some sort of compensation plan before you even go see a home so tell
[00:40:14] us how that's going for you and what the response has been from your your clients um I think it's
[00:40:19] of course going to be an adjustment you know there's gonna be some I think there's gonna be some
[00:40:23] avenues taken that maybe turn around go like there's gonna be some kings that need to be worked out
[00:40:28] but I think ultimately it's great for the industry uh so when I have these conversations it's all
[00:40:32] about transparency right um if you really think about it with the only or the only like
[00:40:38] profession that will just jump up and go and drive however far and potentially waste a bunch of
[00:40:44] time without one bit of agreement or tie to that client and that's insane because really what other
[00:40:51] what other job done that you know yeah attorneys don't just start working for free going I hope
[00:40:56] you're gonna pay me someday yeah and then also with being like a taboo topic of like okay why
[00:41:01] did I not talked about that never said well with me because it was and I never liked the phrase of
[00:41:05] the seller the seller pays the commission because it's not really true number one it depends on how
[00:41:10] you look at it it depends on how you look at it yeah the settlement statement says it but like
[00:41:14] um as far as I'm concerned buyers the only person brought money to the table um and I'm the
[00:41:19] as far as I'm concerned the buyers actually paying interest on that so if you want to get technical
[00:41:22] I think the buyer might be taking a bigger hit than the seller but again someone can argue that
[00:41:27] they're willing to pay for vice versa but um I think transparency is just the biggest the biggest thing
[00:41:33] and just the simple statement that nobody can really rebuttal in my opinion is nobody works for free
[00:41:39] and this is something and I've had these conversations um you know shallot find managing broker
[00:41:43] she has been pushing us to talk to to have these really hard conversations before all of this you
[00:41:49] know and our stuff came about that you know so we felt fully prepared um and so when we sit down
[00:41:54] and I always do a buyer's meeting and it's one of the first things I talk about and that's actually
[00:42:00] one of the first things even when I want to a listing appointment um and again my yes you broker
[00:42:03] taught me this uh bring up the uncomfortable part first I do I do think that it shows that you're
[00:42:08] confident and it shows that you're not trying to hide anything and so I do I just bring it up first
[00:42:13] you know it might you know a lot of agents probably won't have this conversation with you but
[00:42:17] I don't have time to waste I want to help you and this is going to help all of us because there's
[00:42:23] so much transparency here and what the states like I work for X amount and nine times out of ten
[00:42:29] if you have if you have the seller and the seller's agent if it's a normal agent things are going
[00:42:34] to keep going the way they do hopefully um they're going to be offering a compensation whether that's
[00:42:39] 2% to 1 1 2 1 2 1 2 or if it's zero however it shakes out whenever ways you got to get creative I don't
[00:42:45] work for less than X and they appreciate the way that I that I that I put it out there and I'm like
[00:42:51] these are the different scenarios that can happen you might have an agent offering this and
[00:42:55] yeah that might not even be needed or it's a half percent and it's going to be I think just
[00:43:00] being honest with them and saying hey we're working through these changes too this is new to the
[00:43:06] the the real state world this is new to everybody and this is what we know so far and I think if you
[00:43:12] are wanting to purchase the biggest you know asset of your life I think that it's it's it's I
[00:43:18] I don't think it should be a big long hard fun if you want to hire someone to guide you through it
[00:43:22] I really don't but if it is we don't have to work together you know it's not I don't want to
[00:43:30] ever work with anyone who doesn't want to work with me and I'll never tie anybody and I'll never
[00:43:33] force anyone's hand and signing anything um the most I can do is just be honest and tell you what
[00:43:38] I deliver and tell you everything put on the table you make a decision for yourself but I think
[00:43:44] people really appreciate the confidence and the honesty when you just explain it the way that's
[00:43:51] agreed so you have a podcast us the REALTOR talk with Steph and Cal which is available everywhere
[00:43:58] podcasts are served tell us about that it's a work in progress um so Stephanie my mentor
[00:44:06] her and I we always did like short Instagram reels and just it was always be random stuff like
[00:44:11] oh hey this is as it is or oh hey market update and I'm a huge podcast listener love podcast
[00:44:17] tell her new about you like everything I love podcasts on which is our podcast and this was like
[00:44:22] last fall and just you know naive us thinking it would just be this like okay let's just record
[00:44:27] and throw it on I don't know before missing something and that's why I asked you before we started
[00:44:32] what you use just because I'm like why is starting a podcast the hardest endeavor of my life
[00:44:36] far and um so we're working out the games but I really we're enjoying it we're honestly
[00:44:43] just having fun with it um I think it's a really good for both clients and REALTOR so listen to
[00:44:49] we kind of we really it's a very relaxed podcast we don't really uh it's not very buttoned up we
[00:44:54] don't care if there's some ums of lights and laughs and we talk over each other a little bit but
[00:44:59] you learn a little bit about real estate and just kind of hanging out with us in a way and I think
[00:45:04] that there's at least a few good nuggets whether you're an agent or a client that you can take from
[00:45:09] each episode um but we're still in the beginning works so just note note that we're working at it
[00:45:15] yeah it is the podcast or tough I know for the first year of my show I didn't even look at the numbers
[00:45:20] because they would have just depressed me and even today I try not to obsess about the numbers
[00:45:26] because even though our show is a lot more popular than it used to be it's still never going to
[00:45:31] be a number that I like so if if you if you're if you're it's like stepping on a scale like what are
[00:45:36] the odds the number that shows back to me is actually a number I want to see um so true yeah it's
[00:45:42] probably a zero zero percent you listen back on your high school you either no but but I will say
[00:45:49] I do take feedback and so you know ultimately the audience is the is who you need to serve and
[00:45:55] of course any podcaster you know should be considering their audience and so for me I just
[00:46:00] I go by the temperature of the audience I also check our numbers to see if we're losing
[00:46:04] us subscribers are gaining them but at the end of the day it's all about the quality of the content
[00:46:09] and so you know we just at our show we just try to continue to deliver you know really helpful
[00:46:15] information to agents I hope that it's helpful it seems to be for a lot of listeners yeah
[00:46:20] but it is also it's a it's a lot of work I think there's in the other thing too about why a podcast
[00:46:26] is so difficult to start is there's like a billion podcasts out there so so it's hard to get
[00:46:32] anyone to notice because there's so money anybody can start a podcast right so it's yeah and a lot
[00:46:38] of people do yeah yeah yeah so it's it's tricky but I think it's super helpful because even if your
[00:46:46] clients know that you're starting the show and it's again it's it's kind of both four agents
[00:46:51] that you're your show and for clients or for the public I think it really just makes it it's a
[00:46:57] way that people can get to know you better right so they're listening to your voice they feel maybe
[00:47:02] a little bit more connected to you because they're listening to you have conversations there's
[00:47:05] there's something about you know listening to people do you feel like I have like this weird even
[00:47:11] though it's not really a relationship with someone I feel like I know that person a little bit or
[00:47:15] I know I have a story about that which is so I had which has never happened it was a
[00:47:20] brand up not a referral nothing it was a random lead just called the office for me so I'm like okay
[00:47:26] cool so I went to this condo and she listens to my podcast and she literally I'm not kidding you
[00:47:34] I felt like I knew her after because of just how comfortable she was she we didn't even have a
[00:47:38] listing agreement signed yet because I just you know I leave it with them and I send it to them
[00:47:41] electronically handed me the keys before I even left so nothing was signed because it was it was
[00:47:46] gonna be vacant and she had the place and the gosh it was meticulous how hers were clean everything
[00:47:51] should yeah I listen to your podcast because we put in there on how to save your house how to do
[00:47:55] these things this woman made me easiest listing presentation in my life because she already felt
[00:48:00] like she knew me and it was like all of the things that I would say I have it said at some point
[00:48:06] in the podcast she was realistic about price she was like yeah I don't want to be sitting on the
[00:48:10] like all of these things that I we try to get across to our client in the podcast so I like I called
[00:48:14] Stephanie right after I left and I'm like the podcast finally paid off because literally this
[00:48:19] client was a dream and she referenced our podcast so many times and I'm like that is honestly if
[00:48:25] that's the most that comes out of this podcast that is great because it made my life so much easier
[00:48:29] by meeting a complete stranger who I thought was a she was a complete stranger to me but she
[00:48:34] already knew me and she liked me and she trusted me and it really made such a difference and I'm
[00:48:38] like okay that was like all right you should keep doing this rallying Stephanie yeah and I
[00:48:43] have a suggestion for our listeners if looked at everyone needs to have a podcast there's certainly
[00:48:49] enough of them out there but it real estate is hyper local and I know like I live in in the city I
[00:48:54] live in Wicker Park I want to know what's going on in Wicker Park I am sure there's a Wicker Park
[00:48:58] podcast I've I should look to see if there is one because I'd like to know about the the goings-on
[00:49:03] or you know if it's a suburb or a neighborhood or whatever area the agent may specialize in as
[00:49:10] they're kind of true north like that's this is kind of the area I know better than anything I
[00:49:15] think anybody can create a little local podcast for their community and feature local businesses
[00:49:21] you know really get the word out in the local community I'd be like hey I just want to support
[00:49:26] local businesses here and you know who would say no to you know wanting some free publicity for
[00:49:31] their you know clothing store or their restaurant yeah so and I think it it also demonstrates
[00:49:37] too that you care about the community and so you know you just gave a great example so
[00:49:41] somebody came to you because they listed to your show and they were they didn't you didn't need to
[00:49:47] sell yourself quite as much as you would for somebody who doesn't it hasn't heard you because
[00:49:51] they've already listened to you probably a few hours of you speaking and you're giving them
[00:49:56] that obviously valuable information that they were willing to contact you after the podcast and say
[00:50:02] hey let's work together so you're right I think there's a way to create podcasts for the for your
[00:50:08] your public that is really super useful to them in which case it will just save you time going
[00:50:15] forward about you know of course we know we don't look we know referrals can come lots of different
[00:50:20] ways that to me was a referral that you received it wasn't technically from another client but it
[00:50:25] was from yourself because your content out there was obviously now how did she find your content
[00:50:29] that's a good question I don't know I actually should probably ask her that well I know her daughter
[00:50:34] she said her daughter always use that property so you could tell they were wanting someone with
[00:50:37] that properties um so they they she just knew she wanted to use that properties and I when it came
[00:50:43] to looking for the agent maybe somehow stumbled upon my podcast um but yeah it was great and then
[00:50:48] another time I used the podcast was um for we were in a multiple offer situation and even though I
[00:50:54] go over all of the multiple offer scenarios at my initial buyers meeting when it comes down to
[00:50:59] the nitty gritty sometimes they have short term memory loss and so I literally mean satanated
[00:51:03] an entire episode of the multiple offer toolbox of all the things you can do in a multiple offer
[00:51:08] situation and really going in depth about them and I sent the episode to my clients I was like
[00:51:12] honestly just listen to that snare I call that was such a good refresher thank you like just stuff
[00:51:16] like that love it I really really great advice what I think what agents if you want to think about
[00:51:22] a podcast it doesn't have to be interviewing somebody it doesn't have to be being super entertaining it
[00:51:27] just has to be useful so if you're if you think about what are my clients routinely ask me time
[00:51:32] and time and time again that those are those are episodes right there that's an episode say hey
[00:51:37] here's here's one of my frequently asked questions that you know most of my home buyers end up asking
[00:51:42] or homes you know or sellers etc um here's you know how to think about what neighborhoods might be
[00:51:48] the best fit or here you know anyway it really just giving people insight in how a REALTOR thinks
[00:51:53] I think is really important because because you obviously have wisdom experience knowledge that the
[00:52:00] person that you're representing does not have and so if you can sort of give that away for free at
[00:52:05] least some of it um you know and a lot of people might think well I don't want to give away my
[00:52:09] you know my my my my secret sauce and I'm like well your secret sauce is really you and it's all the
[00:52:15] things you do it's not really your knowledge your knowledge is a part of it but you can give your
[00:52:20] knowledge away for free and what what will happen is people look we live in a world where we expect
[00:52:25] content to be free so right yeah I mean whether it's social media or YouTube or wherever we we don't
[00:52:31] we don't yes you can pay you can pay for content most people don't so this idea is I mean this
[00:52:37] podcast is free of course so you know we if I started charging I'd I think I'd lose most of my audience
[00:52:44] no maybe yeah I could charge I could charge like yeah not this one no but I could it will yeah I
[00:52:55] guess I could charge guests but I don't feel right about that but but asking my audience to chip in
[00:53:00] is is certainly you know certainly reasonable but you know we just thankfully don't don't have to do
[00:53:05] that maybe someday we'll do that but for now you know again putting out this and REALTOR's never
[00:53:12] have to charge for content because they're using it as a way to market themselves so it's it's a
[00:53:16] really great idea you know consider even if it's just you know best restaurants in Wicker Park and
[00:53:22] that's your podcast and all you do is feature one restaurant a week and you go over and you talk
[00:53:27] to the owner and you record it I am telling you people are going to if if if you can tell people
[00:53:33] about it they are going to want to know things like that or you know we're gonna check out all the
[00:53:37] parks or or whenever whatever you're into like if you if you learn something new that day like for
[00:53:44] instance I just posted I was in my car and I just say that you might I was with my inspector same
[00:53:48] inspector I always use and he just he said something that put it that I knew that but he put it
[00:53:53] in such simple terms he's like you know there's six major components that house there's your
[00:53:56] roof windows HVAC plumbing electrical and windows and so I'm like he's like those of the six
[00:54:05] major functions so if you have at least four of those six that are in good working order usually
[00:54:09] that's that's a good you know a good sign thing and I literally hopped on Instagram and I was like
[00:54:13] he just put it in such simple terms so if you're a homeowner what are the six main components you
[00:54:18] want to always pay attention to and make sure that they are maintained enough to date and if you're
[00:54:21] a buyer these are the six main things that you should probably make sure are you know somewhat in
[00:54:25] control when you're buying a house like and again I I know those things but I'm like that's just
[00:54:29] such a great way to put it and so I just put it out there's a piece of advice like content can be
[00:54:34] anything it people I don't know is that some of the things that people watch so that almost keeps my
[00:54:40] those anxiety levels of like oh is this stupid opposed or oh is this like we all get that we
[00:54:46] all experience it is something I think that's human nature but if you just remember the
[00:54:51] ridiculousness that's out there and the amount of like just the worst content ever that's consumed
[00:54:57] like you're just another you know dropping the bucket and to me that is actually a little bit it
[00:55:02] makes me feel a little bit better like I'm just throwing that out there because you know it could
[00:55:06] be a lot of anxiety with that yeah I think you know having anxiety around any new skill that you're
[00:55:13] learning is totally normal and we need as as REALTORS or as any business professional or any
[00:55:20] just any human really we need to learn to be okay with being uncomfortable especially when we're
[00:55:26] learning a new skill because the only way we really learn is through failure and failure is of
[00:55:30] course not a lot of fun for most of us but it is the pathway to actually learning things and
[00:55:35] and applying them so this idea of having anxiety is like you got to get a lit not you Kelly but
[00:55:41] anyone who's wanting to you know learn a new skill whether it's having a buyer conversation about
[00:55:46] price or starting a podcast or you know deciding to work with investors which you know you're an
[00:55:51] investor yourself you know that's a whole decision because a lot of agents are like I don't really
[00:55:56] understand investment properties well okay maybe today you don't and if you want to build that
[00:56:01] into your practice you're going to want to learn those skills and it's going to be really uncomfortable
[00:56:05] and it's going to be a little scary and that's how you know it's actually how you know you're on the
[00:56:09] right track if it's a little scary you're on the right track I agree and that's something too that like
[00:56:14] it is a new agent even to this day like I never want to stop learning like I you should you
[00:56:21] should want to continue learning because there's even things like there's there's certain things about
[00:56:24] reality that I learned a news usually something new with every deal and it's great and that's all
[00:56:28] you can ask for it and that's again brings you back to mentorship because you know how I always say
[00:56:33] stuff and he did my first three deals it was just my voice because hey what is this or hey what do
[00:56:37] I do not so hey what like I mean she literally and there's no better way to learn at least for my
[00:56:41] brain is to be literally just coached through the process which is what I try to replicate to my
[00:56:47] clients and you can coach people through the process via a podcast as well so yeah so
[00:56:54] this there's really really great so speaking of your podcast it is REALTOR talk with Steph and
[00:57:00] Kell will have a link to that in our show notes also the website to work with Stephanie and her

[00:57:29] part of the country who maybe has clients that move to Chicago or maybe you're in one of the markets
[00:57:35] where people move from Chicago to for example Florida is one of those places yeah Texas Arizona there's
[00:57:43] lots of you know South Carolina maybe there's lots of places that are we know that people retire to
[00:57:49] or maybe you know think about having a winter home and and if you are in those markets or you have

[00:58:05] best way one of our age one of our listeners could I get in touch with you I would say Instagram
[00:58:10] is a great one and then also my my cellphone number my cellphone numbers all over my social self feel free
[00:58:16] really anyway you know I check all my dns I don't have anyone doing that for base so you know
[00:58:22] anyway and what's what's your Instagram it's Kelly Dugan underscore real estate Kelly Dugan
[00:58:29] underscore real estate on Instagram we'll have a link to that in the show notes as well Kelly thank you
[00:58:34] so much and by the way we should mention to you the reason Kelly came on to our radar is I think you
[00:58:41] did you reach out to us or am I wrong about that or did we reach out to you I talked about my
[00:58:45] real it with my podcast with that right so this is a this I knew there was something that you had
[00:58:50] done proactively and I just had forgotten because it's been months since since that happened and
[00:58:55] this is a really important thing Kelly reached out and now I'm sort of remembering it and you were
[00:59:00] like maybe you asked a question or you asked for some advice or help or or whatever and I think
[00:59:05] we got on the phone pretty quickly or vis-à-esail or whatever it was you know how many times I get
[00:59:11] asked for help on a podcast like almost never maybe once a year so it's this is also a great um
[00:59:18] you know the reason I'm bringing this up I think it's a great opportunity for all of our listeners to
[00:59:22] think about who in your local market do you really admire whether they work at your firm at a
[00:59:27] different firm it's probably better if it's even a different firm you know you can reach out to
[00:59:31] those people and say I really I really respect you know you and what your your businesses and I would
[00:59:40] love to buy you a cup of coffee and just pick your brain for 10 minutes if you have time or just
[00:59:45] you know ask you some questions it's the most flattering thing and I think we often think that
[00:59:50] these top producers are untouchable or and a lot of them some of them are I mean some of them are
[00:59:55] just too busy or they're just you know they don't have the time or want it you know the need to
[00:59:59] meet with you but a lot of them will and you you'd be surprised at how few people reach out to
[01:00:05] them for advice and guidance because we get a little intimidated by that but um Kelly was not
[01:00:10] in Tim I mean she should be like I love sharing I think there's enough business for everybody I think
[01:00:16] that the cut-propeness of this industry and like agents and everything like we have to all help
[01:00:20] each other because we're all gonna be on the other side and we're all shunned for the same goal
[01:00:24] so that business for everybody and I think ego will be like the first thing to honestly make
[01:00:29] your business go down in my opinion you do it this is a people business you have to whether
[01:00:35] that person's an agent whether that person anything you just your reputation's gonna follow you
[01:00:40] perfectly said and great place to wrap up so the podcast is REALTOR Talk with Steph and Kell

And yeah, Kelly, welcome to the show. Thanks for having me. I'm so excited. Yeah, I am. I can not believe that you are starting the sourdough life because I have so I have a plethora of information for you on that. Yeah. Well, I'd like my first one. I think my first one is going to be a regular sourdough loaf. And then I want to try a sourdough dark rye next. So those are all. And I just bought a Dutch oven because I know you're supposed to have a Dutch oven. So anyway, okay, but back to you. Well, yeah, yeah. So tell us more about you. So how did you get into real estate? You know, so I actually, so right out of high school, I started, well, I started working my first job ever was at a hair salon in Frankfurt, Jeffrey Lamort Salon, which was like the best first job ever. And I was, I started there when I was 16 and I went to beauty school and I kind of got to a point probably around like 25, 26 to where I just kind of felt like I needed something new. I kind of feel like I stopped growing and evolving in that sense. And I originally wanted to get into real estate for investing purposes. Like sure. To see where my career is now, I would have never in a million years then guess that it would be where it is now in a good way, obviously, because my family, I don't have anybody who was in real estate. I don't have, you know, an uncle or anything like that who had this real estate business. So it was very foreign to me. And so I was going to real estate school. I was working my old job and I told very select of my like hair clients at the time that I was going to be, you know, because I didn't really know what was ahead of it. I was crossing each bridge, little by little. And one of my clients, who I was putting his hair, his wife, Stephanie Campbell, he's like, wow, you know, she's trying to build a team out here. So I was just so I met with Stephanie for coffee and it like kind of is the rest of this history. And looking back, I'm like, I just am so blessed to fall into her lap. I like to say it because once I got into the business, I realized how much risk new agents are for signing with their own brokerage. Sure. Or, you know, committing to a team like I honestly had no idea about any of it. And I just kind of went with my butt and trusted Stephanie and I couldn't be more thankful because we don't operate that way. They got in like our team. I don't even like to say a team. It's truly a group. We just help each other. It's not like all those nightmare team stories that you hear and everything like that. So I kind of just, you know, Stephanie took me under her wing and the rest of history. Like now I'm producing like a full-time agent. That's all I do. And it's craziness, fire sellers, you know, some investing here and there. I originally wanted to do, but I'm definitely a thick of it of being a full-time agent now. And I couldn't be more, you know, grateful for how it all happened. And how many years now have you been in? This is my fifth year. Wow. So you are now coming out of the hardest part, which usually is those first three years. And things are probably starting to just work a little bit more smoothly. Is that kind of what's happening? Yes, it's always, it's more chaotic as the years go because you get more business. I actually was just saying that this morning, it's like, I think I just have to get used to always feeling like I have a to-do list that'll never be fully fulfilled. It'll be my to-do list. That's fulfilled for the things that we need to get done and the law is being scraggled. Or it's down there. So yeah, so I think that it was very, very hard in the beginning. And I, you know, I have a lot of credit to. I was still working part-time with my old job to help. And then of course, the help of my fiance, like being able to take that leap and go full-time was huge. And that was really the game changer for my business. Yeah. I, that is, that is amazing. I was thinking to you about you being a stylist before. Yeah. So it's funny here in Illinois, at least, that I don't know if this is the same across the country. But the number of hours that a stylist has to put in before they can actually start practicing is something like 12 or 1300 hours, right? Isn't it? Yes. So I, yeah, it's, I don't even know the full amount. But it took me a while because I did, I started in high school. So I had to go half day, high school, half day, beauty school. So it took me like all in all about a year and a half to complete. And then I had to do like, you know, a year internship at the salon too. So it was a lot to it. And I love doing here like I said. I just, I just stopped growing. And I, I will say you wouldn't guess it. But the people skills and the communication skills and the talking skills that I, that I took with me from doing here all those years and having that alone time and one on one face time. But the client has helped me tremendously in my real estate career. So I don't, I credit so much to that until thankful that I did that for all those years. Yeah. It's, it's funny. I was just, I was just getting my haircut recently. And somebody is, is make is in the process of going from being the person who washes hair to a full-time stylist. And he's been on that path for years. And he was telling me about the 1300 hours or whatever it is. And I said, you know, the irony of this is, you know, a haircut, I think my haircuts like 65 dollars, whatever it is. And, and, and you know, somebody has to do 13 hours or 1300 hours of training for that yet to get a real estate license in Illinois. You only need to do 75 hours. And that's incredible because that's not a 65 dollar haircut. That could be a six six hundred fifty thousand dollar haul. Right. Or 100 percent. And that's one of my biggest things is like, gosh, I do wish. I do wish it was just a little harder to get license. Yeah. Yep. I think, and I think right now with the changes that we're seeing from the NAR settlement, I think we're going to start seeing some agents who maybe, you know, aren't all that in the business as you were, you know, as we were talking before we went on, I think we're going to see some people exiting the business. In fact, we're already, we're already seeing that. And so I think the good agents really have nothing to worry about because there's just going to be more market share for them to gobble up. I agree. Yeah. So tell us a little bit about how you prospect. Because right now, you know, there's a lot of things we can't control. Obviously, inventory, interest rates, those are, those are well beyond our control. As much as we can try to, you know, persuade our clients that now is a good time to buy in a sense because, of course, when rates drop, everyone's going to flood the market with buyers. And of course, those prices are all going to jump up. But, you know, a lot of people just don't want to make any changes right now because they don't like that interest rate or they don't like the inventory that's out there. So there's a lot you can't control at the moment. But of course, there's a lot that you can control with your activities and your actions. So I would love to know what are you doing right now to stay busy, stay productive, just keep the business growing. You know, so I just, I really do focus on my clients in front of me. That is a big thing. And I, of course, it's natural that, you know, during the busier seasons, you're going to have the clients in front of you. And then in the more quiet times, you're going to have that time to maybe like, you know, call 50 people or do any of that thing. So when it comes to like prospecting, I, my thing always, I love to snow while off my lessons. I have one listing. That's what I am targeting that entire neighborhood. I'm going to send like we get brochures made for the listings. And usually with it selling in a day or two, I have 20 left over. So what I'll do is I'll look through that whole neighborhood and I'll see who's on the longest and who's probably most likely to sell. And I will send that brochure and say, Hey, I just sell your neighbor's house. This is an example of the marketing that I use. And kind of a little story as to selling their house. And it's, you know, just to make it more off that ticket, not just like, Hey, I'm trying to, trying to buy your house and that kind of thing. So I think snowballing off of your listings, that's always, that's always like a really big one for me. And when it comes to buyers, you know, I have my buyers all set up on Zad List, which I'm sure that you're aware of that platform. And it's great. It's just like this like inner portal that connects you with your clients. And we have like a little chat in there and sending properties back and forth. And when it comes to buyers, you know, facing those types of problems in the sense of like, okay, if interest rates are so high or prices are so high, because, you know, they are. And, you know, and it's one of those things, like you said, there's so many things you can't change. And I think getting them to see that helps a lot. And it's all comes down to your motivation. I mean, I tell my clients all the time, like, yeah, I know that you guys love that two and a half percent interest rate. But you have your third kid on the way. Are you going to put an addition on your townhouse or are you going to bust out of the scenes and be uncomfortable just to save that two and a half percent interest rate? Whatever way you want to do it, it's fine. That's your life, you know, but I think it's just like delivering them with the hard facts and saying you're always, you're always going to deal with a, I always think you're always going to deal with a brunt of a market. If you're going to be a seller in this market, you're going to sell high and you're going to be so happy. Well, when you put your buyer shoes on, you're going to be so mad. So which one do you want? Because you're not unless you're buying in two totally different markets, you're likely not going to get bold. So I tell my clients right now, you know, you're buying with higher interest rates and higher prices. So me personally, I'm seeing things still go really fast, but I'm not seeing the 20, 30,000 over asking like I was, when rates were two and a quarter. So I just think right now it's one of those things you have to be serious and motivated and you have to focus on what you can't change. Location, like layout, just those types of things and this isn't the market to get hung up on an ugly cabinet color. Those kinds of things, they just really narrowing down what's important to them. And a lot of times it's, I'm like, look, if you can squeeze out another year and that busted through the scene, sound home with that to an app, you know, see what happens. But if rates drop next year, it will be competitive because then we're at the inventory issue. So it's just like this vicious circle and people think that like it's going to be the best time to buy now. Whereas no one can time the market. It's all situational and to what you are looking for and what your lifestyle is, you know. I think, yeah, I think it's interesting. Like we're talking about feelings, like customer feelings and how feelings really ultimately most of the time, Trump logic, right? So even though, yeah, it's like, yeah, and it's just human nature that we were really driven by our feelings, kind of drive the bus more so than logic in certain situations. And buying a home being such a large price point for most families, most individuals, a lot of times the largest financial decision. I know when I bought my most recent kind of, it was the largest financial decision I'd ever made. And what's funny is I was telling Kelly before we started, I was like, I said, oh, I just bought a new car. And we were talking about it. And what I didn't mention that I think would be helpful to our audience is one thing that the salesperson who was very good said to me is when we were in the process of negotiating, which is always the worst part. Now, some people like that. I don't like it because it's just whatever. It just seems like a big cat mouse game. But anyway, eventually, we arrived at something that was reasonable. And she said something very smart to me. And this particular person is like the number one salesperson. They have 15 different dealerships. She's like the person I've got lucky and got her. And she said, here's the thing. You're going to walk out of here. And she's lovely. I really like her. She's like a good human being. I like her. I'd hang out whether I'd be your friend. But in that moment, we're sort of not adversaries, but we're certainly competing with each other to try to get the, I'm trying to get the lowest price. She wants the highest price. And she's like, look, no matter what number you end up, we end up deciding on, you're going to walk out of here. And you're probably going to feel like you got ripped off. She goes, that's totally normal. It happens to everybody. She said, if you feel that way and you wake up the next day and you feel that way, I want you to call me because I'll talk you through it. But I want to make sure that you're at least comfortable with this number right now because I know later it's it's going to come back to you and you're going to feel like, and I thought, boy, that was so smart because as I was leaving, that's exactly what happened. I'm like, I really liked her. And then I went, wait a minute, I just get ripped off. No, I didn't. But I didn't. But she was wise to say that. And I think I think agents would think would do well to think about, you know, hey, I know it can feel like now is not a good time. And here's why here's people who are making decisions now. Here's why they're making it. And here's how it's going. And, and, you know, but I think this idea of really explaining sort of, here's, here's the, I mean, because even in a great market, even in a time when they do get the price they want, at some point, they're going to freak out on the buy side at least at some point, they're going to have a moment, whether they share it with you or not, maybe just internalize it, but they're going to have a moment where they're like, oh my god, what am I doing? Right? Unless they're just a seasoned buyer and it's no big deal. For most of us, it's a big, big deal. So I love this, this idea of sort of coaching somebody through those feelings and feels like that, that's a big thing for you too. Oh gosh, I think educating and coaching, those are like probably the two main hubs of my business because I just think that it does make for such a smoother transaction and it makes for repetitive business and referrals and I really need heavily on my sphere and my friends and family. And I think if you treat your clients, if you give them the best service, they're going to do a lot of the marketing for you, truly. And I think that again, like I say, I snowball off my listings, I snowball off my clients. Like, of course, I want new clients, sure, but if I could get referrals to where I have a little bit of a connection, that's a little bit more of a solidified relationship and process for me. I would choose that all day long. So yeah, I think educating and coaching and the feelings part absolutely, I tell people all the time, I'm like, you're not going to wake off one day and feel like today is a great day to job 500 grand. Right. It's never a good day to do that. And also, too, when you say, like, people are like, okay, when I walk into the house, I'll just know what's the one. And I'm like, I don't think even I think there's always going to be a little bit of that double on your shoulder, reminding you of this is the biggest purchase that you've made in your life so far. So again, it is normal for nerves and everything, but you just have to, I always like to say, as a buyers agent, I like the best friend that knows every single bit of the process. That's your right hand man. I mean, truly, because it's like if we talked six months ago, and I knew everything that you were looking for, and I knew the price point and everything, and then six months later, we're there, and you have that feeling, I'm like, look, this is, this has been the goal. This is here. I mean, obviously, again, like it's going to be a lifestyle change, but again, we're not going 100 grand more than what you had originally said a couple of months ago. Like this is what you've been wanting. This is where, you know, we're here. We're here. And I think that you have the feeling of, okay, I don't want anyone else to have this house. I think that's more of a realistic way to put it versus walking in and being like, this is the one. That's interesting. I don't want anyone else to have this home. That's a really interesting phrase. I really very much like that. So I think that's a great tip for our listeners to consider saying to them, you know, as you're going through and evaluating these homes, you might have in aha moment, where you walk in and you're like, this is it. That happens once in a while, but I wouldn't count on that experience happening because there's, like you said, there's always a little bit of doubt that's going to come in. It's normal. It's human. It's totally, it's actually to protect you in case you're doing something totally reckless. So it's good to have that little, you know, second voice, saying, well, maybe you should think about this. But then, you know, maybe you could reinforce which way you want to go by saying, would I be okay with somebody else having this home? I love that. And if the answer is yes, then we move on. Right. And it's also true. The same thing in the sense of when you're multiple offers and they're like, they're offering, let's say, five, 50, and it should be good to five, 60. I'm like, you need to offer it at a price that you're okay with losing it at. So if you do five, 50 and someone wants to come in and pay five, 60 at your, your mindset should be let them, you know, like you, that's what you want to offer it that you're okay with losing it at. So it's all, it's, I feel like this job is just, it is very psychology. They very, how, how do you educate your clients again? Because if they have an agent who's not really given them much assurance and they're kind of wishy-washy or anything like that doubt is just going to like, you're going to be up all night and probably have cold buyer's seat because you just, you don't have that assurance because you're a brand new first time home buyer and you have no idea what you're getting into because, you know, you're not really getting that from your agent. I'd like to go back to the, that's really great point. I want to go back to the snowball, sort of situation that you have in specifically around when, when you sell a home that you look, you know, for neighbors who are, her nearby who are probably familiar with this property and say, hey, by the way, I just sold and you send them a brochure and a letter. Have you ever liked thought and again, I, I don't know if people do this anymore, but have you ever thought about going door to door being like, hey, just FYI, I sold so and so's how I'm just wanted to say hi or, to me, I don't know how easy that would be for me to do. I'm just asking because I know there are people that do that, but just curious if that's ever something you've tried. You know what? I, haven't, I would not be opposed though because I am much more of an in-person person than like, you know, it's, it's more part of like my well-oiled machine in the sense of, okay, I have a listing and I always do the brochures, but that's only like maybe like 15 or 20 of them. And then I'll do also like, you know, a mile radius of postcards. I have a QR code that will, you know, basically give them an estimated value of their property. And then I find out who scancels codes and then I will call and follow up. I do love the idea of going in person. Truthfully, I think at that point it would probably be a time thing. But yeah, no, I just usually always do the mail and, I mean, there is a little bit of an intimidating factor when it comes to door knocking. I don't, you know, it's the worst too. If like you, it, me and Stephanie had to do this, this food drive. So I was helping her. We were, you know, going door to door and all we were doing was leading bags on people's doors, not even raining doorbells. And the amount of times that I jumped because the dog just like, I don't know where, just because I was walking up to the house. I'm like, okay, I don't know. Like, you're nagging that much. Yeah. The, the, the only, the best way I've heard for people to do door knocking, because again, and also too, there's a safety consideration. And, and just, you know, sort of do people like getting their doorbell rang. I don't know. Right. But, but one way that I've seen it work is if there's an open house. So prior to the transaction closing, going around saying, Hey, just FYI, we're doing an open house at your neighbors with the Sunday. Feel free to swing by that kind of thing. Didn't mean to bug you. Just want to let you know you'll probably see me here on Sunday. If you want to swing on by it, everybody wants to see their inside of their neighbor's homes. Right. No, that's a great idea. And that is something that I'll do if I'm doing an open house. I will. Or one of my favorite things to do, actually, if it's a smaller neighborhood before we list because neighbors love to know this group. They love to know the end. So I will write a letter to the neighbors that says like, just to give you the courtesy, I, you know, I appreciate the coiteness of this neighborhood. And if you see someone usual traffic, it's because I'm listing your neighbor's house and that gets them. And then I'm like, if you know of anybody, if you have any friends or family who want to be your neighbor, let you know, and they call us like that. And they're like, oh, and you know, even if they don't have anyone, they're going to call me because they're interested in what's going out of their neighbor's house. So that's a really good one. I like to use if we have that time, like just say that we're prepping for photos or whatever it is. I always do that too. You know, that's, that's an amazing idea. So I'll tell you, I live in a condo building in the city. There's, I should know how many units there are. I don't know. I think let's say 40. I think there's 40 condos in our building. And we've had a few people. It's only three and a half years old. Actually, it was listed by Bikari McCormick, who's an app properties person. You're company. Anyway, and so a couple of these properties have sold since the original owners. I'm stolen original owner. And I have received exactly zero postcards, emails, texts. Now again, texts and emails. People won't get mailers. Anything saying what you just said, hey, just in case you didn't know one of your neighbors in the process of selling, if you'd like to have one of somebody you know, be your neighbor. I mean, think about how simple, like they could have literally just walked through our building and slipped it under. I put it on our door, a little postcard. It wouldn't cost anything. And I would love for somebody I know to be my neighbor. So this idea of what you just said is, is such a great, great idea. So for those of you who sound like you're doing them a favor, not doing them a favor, but like you're letting them in on the scoop. Exactly. Exactly. Because the only time, I mean, I don't, I don't monitor my building. So I don't know when people are buying and selling. The only time I know is when I see the delivery truck pull up, I'm like, I guess someone's moving out, moving in. And you know, in a kind of building, especially a smaller one, you do develop relationships with neighbors, not all of them, but some of them. And so it is kind of a bummer when somebody leaves, because you know, and so this idea of knowing that is really I'm sort of shocked. And I don't think it's because everybody knows that I'm in real estate. I don't think that's the reason I'm not getting the postcards. I think it's just nobody's doing it. And it's a really digital world. Sometimes I'm like, it's hard to mail the thing anymore, but how can I get it? Because I think that so much of it's lost in email. We have 800 agents at our company. And when we email them something we need from them, almost nobody pays attention to it. When we SMS them, when we send them a text, that's when they pay attention. And again, I know you can't really text strangers, you know, without their permission. But yes, emails get lost and forgotten about. I'm sure your company at properties has the same problem when they email all the agents saying, please do this, do that. And like nobody notices it. So this is yeah, so that's a great point. So in person face to face, voice to voice, those are going to be what when when the game and at least that I've seen. Let's talk a little bit more about marketing. So you're in your fifth year. When did it start? How many years in before the referrals started really flowing just to give our audience who maybe are, you know, they're newer to the business than you? When did it really start to click? So okay, so I got I got licensed in 2019. And so I feel like that. Honestly, well, so obviously I got I always say I had a very good combination of luck and timing and hard work, obviously, because 2019 I went into this completely zero experience, nothing. And I experienced the 2020 crazy COVID market. So it's like I started in like the craziest market, like running around like chicken with my head cut off. So 2020 I did decently good for being a new agent. It's not like I've killed it, but it was just, you know, the market was insane. And then 2021 I would say probably like my third year is when I was like, okay, I feel more like it's a well oiled machine versus me just constantly like waiting for where the next deal is going to come from. Whereas now and I yeah, I would say probably like my third year in is when I felt like, okay, I think I could make this work just doing this if I just continue to grow every year as I have. And just know that one of my favorite things, what real estate is that it truly, it just like fine wine, like you get better with yours. And you get better with experience like you yourself and your brain and everything. Also your reputation and also your experience like that is something I, I wish I would have known more as a new agent is like it's like a fine wine. It gets better in time. Whereas like my last job was something that in time, like you kind of, if you're in older hair styles and you're not really up with the trends, you know, you're not, it's just different in every aspect. Like and I bet one thing I love about real estate is that A, the sky is the limit and B, if you do it correctly and your reputation is good and you're a great agent, it only just gets better year after year after year. So I have a question. So when if you were to think back about your earlier self in real estate, when you first started, you didn't know what you know now, you know, you were probably there's anxiety around how am I going to pay the bills and build this into a business and you know, gosh, I don't have enough clients at the moment. And all of those sort of uncertainty feelings that happen to every single person who starts this business. What would you tell yourself to knowing what you know now? What would you tell your younger self to make that those those first two or three years, which were maybe not super comfortable? What might you say that would make it more comfortable? Honestly, and it sounds so cliche and obvious, but you get what you put in. And that's all I can say. And sometimes that might take a year or two years or three years, but like if you truly truly are dedicated and you put in the work, it will it will work out just with time. And if that's not working out, then I do your leadership around you. I I cut it so much of where I am to Stephanie and being having a good mentor from the start and a great brokerage from the start, I cut it so much today. So if you are in those beginning phases, you just see like nothing's working. Look around you because you are really surrounded yourself with. And you need a mentor and you need somebody because you could do your hours over and over and over again in school, but you really, in my opinion, don't learn anything until you are in the business. Yeah, mentorship is I can't think of anything more important for for a new age. Yeah, let's let's talk about let's talk about your your team because you know, there's lots of different teams and lots of different structures and some people have good experiences with teams and others feel maybe this isn't the right team for me. How did you know what advice would you have for somebody who is thinking about joining a team, but isn't quite totally sure if they should do it? I would say make sure that you just really learn as much as you can about that team before signing anything, I guess like even get to know what agents on that team go on their socials. I think you can I think you can know somebody to an extent on their social videos. You could at least get to know them somehow, some way. And I mean, of course, agents are going to want to look at like a split like my team visit work like that. That's what we call a group. It's not like because Kaelin Kaelin Goldstein and Stephanie Campbell are the team leads. So it's not like Kaelin and Stephanie are getting my production and I'm not like I have 100% of my production and it's not it's just such a black and white group of people who help other people and that's really all all it is. And I think that there's some people out there who we haven't had a bad taste in their mouth from teams that think ones like ours who we just help each other don't exist. We like to camaraderie and we like the gold group and it's just it's just fun. We all get together with our meetings that we share marketing ideas just like how you and I are doing and it helps build that momentum and it's nice because I have someone somewhere up like literally everywhere. If I have a city client where I don't really do too much in the city like hey that goes you know and I have someone northern western suburbs. So I love having everyone everywhere because if a client comes to me and it's not exactly an area that I work I can still help them and I still I still brought value to them by being like hey here's my team member Duval or Frankie or anything like that. But I think it's very important if you're not on a team have a mentor. Just be picky on that that's my biggest piece of advice is be picky and make sure that the agent cares and wants to help like I don't know don't go based on the leaves either my my theory on that is everyone is going if anyone gives you a lead they're not good ones it's always been always been like saying yeah but our team like we don't and we're we're honest about the interiors should say stuff being came in from the start we don't try and get people on our team and they will give you leads because it's not like that we always joke like BIOC for your own clients. Yeah and and what's mentorship should ultimately generate leads meaning the mentorship experience and the knowledge and the wisdom that you learn from these mentors should be the gateway for you to apply those those principles and those practices you know and that's what really is is to me the biggest benefit of joining a team is getting the wisdom and once you have the wisdom like you just point yourself in that same direction and apply the wisdom and the leads will eventually show up maybe not today maybe not tomorrow but within a year for sure and yeah so oh here's a question so when you're in the middle of working with lots of different clients at the same time which I'm sure you always are how do you continually think about I still need to be prospecting even though I'm slammed with business because this is a problem that agents often run into is they get bottlenecked meaning they have a bunch of clients that that happen it's kind of like with online dating too for those single people what happens if you're doing online dating you know you put all these requests and I like this person this person this person and then you hear nothing from any of those people and then all of a sudden like three or four of those people reply at the same time you're like oh boy now I have to talk to all these people and it becomes a little bit like OGs and and and then some of those people fall away and of course and the same sort of thing happens in real estate where you do all this marketing and then eventually you get some things that happen at once but then if you don't continually market that eventually when those transactions either fall away or close then you're back to zero so are you thinking about what can I do every day every week every month just to keep the marketing machine rolling oh this thing doesn't turn off BJ it's sometimes like I said that I find this happening today I'm like I just you know right now I am in the middle of eight or nine deals which is a lot for me being just a solo agent I don't have it I delegated my first thing which was just some just clothes and just listed posts for my socials just to take one thing off my shoulders a little bit of a control freak so that was a big step for me but I I need to because I do need to be more present with the clients in front of me but I have systems which I my brain works very good with systems like okay like I said I list a property and that's my I have that pre little mail to the to those neighbors and then I list the property and then I send the brochures and then I do the postcards that's my listing kind of thing and then I also do quarterly newsletters that I print out and actually send to my sphere it's about 300 people some people you know clients perspective clients everything of that nature and it has the market update it has recipes so that's something to stay in front of them hard paper wise every quarter so it'll be you know a winter one a spring one summer one fall one and also to I do home anniversary gifts so every year I switch that up so that way I'm at least staying in front of my past clients once a year and well technically five times a year because they get my newsletters four times a year so my goal is to just always stay in front of them because it also being just genuine like all my home anniversary cards it is a pain in the butt bringing out a nice you know message in a sharpie and I have like a key change just like do something different every year with them last year I just did like Starbucks gift cards just a five dollar coffee um and so I think those systems help me tremendously because I finally got them down to where I like don't have to wake up anymore and be like okay how am I going to um work on my business and not in my business today that kind of thing whereas my newsletters my home anniversary cards my my postcards just listed just sold all of those things are working on my business and it kind of you know I do those things and during the times that I'm not working in my business and sometimes that's a half day of designing my postcard and making sure that it's to my standards and then the other half is talking to clients and going and showing and doing all that um but yeah it is it's I would have never guessed what it would be like running your own business like this back when I started it just keeps on well let's talk about because you've been in this five years let's talk about what you dislike uh in being about being a REALTOR so what are what's hard for you or what do you wish would we're different um you know honestly and I think that brings up the the buyer broker with uh I mean our uh I think that the risk of potential time wasting is a big thing but that is without any commission sales job right um I think that's something that I you know dislike about the job and also too like I mentioned just some of some agents out there and there's not a lot it's not like I I have I'm so blessed about a lot majority of my deals I do know the agent on the other side and it's you know it's great but you do get those ones where it might be like you know Uncle Joe just has his license just for whatever reason and he's selling Aunt Sally's property and it's it's uh it's real estate is so you need to have the right people in place that you need to have the right team in place in order to like successfully and timely and efficiently get to the finish line of closing and when there's somebody on the other end who you can tell like doesn't care nothing and there's nothing to do about it because they have a they're getting paid whether or not I'm going to make the whole thing it all falls on me they're gonna still get there's always one agent that's gonna catch like a front of a lot of it usually when that happens so I guess the lack of discipline or I guess the lack of standards that they hold for realters I guess would be a good way to put it the time the time-lacing and just the potential because that could be something that's no one's fault they could be something that you spend a year showing someone houses and they just simply decide not to move what are you gonna do be like you know come after them for not wanting to move you know you just hope all you can do in those situations and this is what I tell myself to stay positive all you can hope is that they refer you so if you get them the experience even though they didn't close with you if you were at least professional and on time and you were educated on every date they're they're gonna still remember you so that's just that's the overlining I try to take with me after you know you get you get punched a couple times but yeah I would say that other than that I really do love my job um sometimes it is sometimes it is a lot though you know dealing with if I said in the middle like nine deals right now so everyone has a story everyone has a different place that they're going right everyone is like okay got to meet I got to be in here and then that's and it's a lot to juggle I wish I could just sometimes replicate myself but yeah I would say just the the craziness of it all I wish that there was a little bit more consistency in real estate but that's what makes it exciting is that it's just wild right now and who knows where it'll be in the fall winner right yeah and I'd love to get your thoughts on the NAR settlement which again we'll talk just specifically about buyer representation now of course buyer commissions are not guaranteed to be paid by the by the seller the list agent uh so uh of course buyer representation is now it's really critical to have those conversations around here's what I charge here's how we're going to we're gonna try to get it paid one way and then we may have to go a second way if that doesn't work um and I'd love to get your thoughts on how that's those conversations which you know for being totally frank and I'm not speaking for Kelly or about Kelly but let's be honest the vast majority of REALTORS used to not have those conversations with buyers because technically the buyers were cutting a check so it was it was just easier not to talk about it or to talk about it just kind of briefly and and you know this is probably why why they're the issue the issues we're having today but it's also the way the system was set up so it you know it was it was good for certain reasons and then maybe it wasn't great in other reasons for other ways but we're now in a situation where we do have to have those conversations you know with the buyer every single time and have them agree to some sort of compensation plan before you even go see a home so tell us how that's going for you and what the response has been from your your clients um I think it's of course going to be an adjustment you know there's gonna be some I think there's gonna be some avenues taken that maybe turn around go like there's gonna be some kings that need to be worked out but I think ultimately it's great for the industry uh so when I have these conversations it's all about transparency right um if you really think about it with the only or the only like profession that will just jump up and go and drive however far and potentially waste a bunch of time without one bit of agreement or tie to that client and that's insane because really what other what other job done that you know yeah attorneys don't just start working for free going I hope you're gonna pay me someday yeah and then also with being like a taboo topic of like okay why did I not talked about that never said well with me because it was and I never liked the phrase of the seller the seller pays the commission because it's not really true number one it depends on how you look at it it depends on how you look at it yeah the settlement statement says it but like um as far as I'm concerned buyers the only person brought money to the table um and I'm the as far as I'm concerned the buyers actually paying interest on that so if you want to get technical I think the buyer might be taking a bigger hit than the seller but again someone can argue that they're willing to pay for vice versa but um I think transparency is just the biggest the biggest thing and just the simple statement that nobody can really rebuttal in my opinion is nobody works for free and this is something and I've had these conversations um you know shallot find managing broker she has been pushing us to talk to to have these really hard conversations before all of this you know and our stuff came about that you know so we felt fully prepared um and so when we sit down and I always do a buyer's meeting and it's one of the first things I talk about and that's actually one of the first things even when I want to a listing appointment um and again my yes you broker taught me this uh bring up the uncomfortable part first I do I do think that it shows that you're confident and it shows that you're not trying to hide anything and so I do I just bring it up first you know it might you know a lot of agents probably won't have this conversation with you but I don't have time to waste I want to help you and this is going to help all of us because there's so much transparency here and what the states like I work for X amount and nine times out of ten if you have if you have the seller and the seller's agent if it's a normal agent things are going to keep going the way they do hopefully um they're going to be offering a compensation whether that's 2% to 1 1 2 1 2 1 2 or if it's zero however it shakes out whenever ways you got to get creative I don't work for less than X and they appreciate the way that I that I that I put it out there and I'm like these are the different scenarios that can happen you might have an agent offering this and yeah that might not even be needed or it's a half percent and it's going to be I think just being honest with them and saying hey we're working through these changes too this is new to the the the real state world this is new to everybody and this is what we know so far and I think if you are wanting to purchase the biggest you know asset of your life I think that it's it's it's I I don't think it should be a big long hard fun if you want to hire someone to guide you through it I really don't but if it is we don't have to work together you know it's not I don't want to ever work with anyone who doesn't want to work with me and I'll never tie anybody and I'll never force anyone's hand and signing anything um the most I can do is just be honest and tell you what I deliver and tell you everything put on the table you make a decision for yourself but I think people really appreciate the confidence and the honesty when you just explain it the way that's agreed so you have a podcast us the REALTOR talk with Steph and Cal which is available everywhere podcasts are served tell us about that it's a work in progress um so Stephanie my mentor her and I we always did like short Instagram reels and just it was always be random stuff like oh hey this is as it is or oh hey market update and I'm a huge podcast listener love podcast tell her new about you like everything I love podcasts on which is our podcast and this was like last fall and just you know naive us thinking it would just be this like okay let's just record and throw it on I don't know before missing something and that's why I asked you before we started what you use just because I'm like why is starting a podcast the hardest endeavor of my life far and um so we're working out the games but I really we're enjoying it we're honestly just having fun with it um I think it's a really good for both clients and REALTOR so listen to we kind of we really it's a very relaxed podcast we don't really uh it's not very buttoned up we don't care if there's some ums of lights and laughs and we talk over each other a little bit but you learn a little bit about real estate and just kind of hanging out with us in a way and I think that there's at least a few good nuggets whether you're an agent or a client that you can take from each episode um but we're still in the beginning works so just note note that we're working at it yeah it is the podcast or tough I know for the first year of my show I didn't even look at the numbers because they would have just depressed me and even today I try not to obsess about the numbers because even though our show is a lot more popular than it used to be it's still never going to be a number that I like so if if you if you're if you're it's like stepping on a scale like what are the odds the number that shows back to me is actually a number I want to see um so true yeah it's probably a zero zero percent you listen back on your high school you either no but but I will say I do take feedback and so you know ultimately the audience is the is who you need to serve and of course any podcaster you know should be considering their audience and so for me I just I go by the temperature of the audience I also check our numbers to see if we're losing us subscribers are gaining them but at the end of the day it's all about the quality of the content and so you know we just at our show we just try to continue to deliver you know really helpful information to agents I hope that it's helpful it seems to be for a lot of listeners yeah but it is also it's a it's a lot of work I think there's in the other thing too about why a podcast is so difficult to start is there's like a billion podcasts out there so so it's hard to get anyone to notice because there's so money anybody can start a podcast right so it's yeah and a lot of people do yeah yeah yeah so it's it's tricky but I think it's super helpful because even if your clients know that you're starting the show and it's again it's it's kind of both four agents that you're your show and for clients or for the public I think it really just makes it it's a way that people can get to know you better right so they're listening to your voice they feel maybe a little bit more connected to you because they're listening to you have conversations there's there's something about you know listening to people do you feel like I have like this weird even though it's not really a relationship with someone I feel like I know that person a little bit or I know I have a story about that which is so I had which has never happened it was a brand up not a referral nothing it was a random lead just called the office for me so I'm like okay cool so I went to this condo and she listens to my podcast and she literally I'm not kidding you I felt like I knew her after because of just how comfortable she was she we didn't even have a listing agreement signed yet because I just you know I leave it with them and I send it to them electronically handed me the keys before I even left so nothing was signed because it was it was gonna be vacant and she had the place and the gosh it was meticulous how hers were clean everything should yeah I listen to your podcast because we put in there on how to save your house how to do these things this woman made me easiest listing presentation in my life because she already felt like she knew me and it was like all of the things that I would say I have it said at some point in the podcast she was realistic about price she was like yeah I don't want to be sitting on the like all of these things that I we try to get across to our client in the podcast so I like I called Stephanie right after I left and I'm like the podcast finally paid off because literally this client was a dream and she referenced our podcast so many times and I'm like that is honestly if that's the most that comes out of this podcast that is great because it made my life so much easier by meeting a complete stranger who I thought was a she was a complete stranger to me but she already knew me and she liked me and she trusted me and it really made such a difference and I'm like okay that was like all right you should keep doing this rallying Stephanie yeah and I have a suggestion for our listeners if looked at everyone needs to have a podcast there's certainly enough of them out there but it real estate is hyper local and I know like I live in in the city I live in Wicker Park I want to know what's going on in Wicker Park I am sure there's a Wicker Park podcast I've I should look to see if there is one because I'd like to know about the the goings-on or you know if it's a suburb or a neighborhood or whatever area the agent may specialize in as they're kind of true north like that's this is kind of the area I know better than anything I think anybody can create a little local podcast for their community and feature local businesses you know really get the word out in the local community I'd be like hey I just want to support local businesses here and you know who would say no to you know wanting some free publicity for their you know clothing store or their restaurant yeah so and I think it it also demonstrates too that you care about the community and so you know you just gave a great example so somebody came to you because they listed to your show and they were they didn't you didn't need to sell yourself quite as much as you would for somebody who doesn't it hasn't heard you because they've already listened to you probably a few hours of you speaking and you're giving them that obviously valuable information that they were willing to contact you after the podcast and say hey let's work together so you're right I think there's a way to create podcasts for the for your your public that is really super useful to them in which case it will just save you time going forward about you know of course we know we don't look we know referrals can come lots of different ways that to me was a referral that you received it wasn't technically from another client but it was from yourself because your content out there was obviously now how did she find your content that's a good question I don't know I actually should probably ask her that well I know her daughter she said her daughter always use that property so you could tell they were wanting someone with that properties um so they they she just knew she wanted to use that properties and I when it came to looking for the agent maybe somehow stumbled upon my podcast um but yeah it was great and then another time I used the podcast was um for we were in a multiple offer situation and even though I go over all of the multiple offer scenarios at my initial buyers meeting when it comes down to the nitty gritty sometimes they have short term memory loss and so I literally mean satanated an entire episode of the multiple offer toolbox of all the things you can do in a multiple offer situation and really going in depth about them and I sent the episode to my clients I was like honestly just listen to that snare I call that was such a good refresher thank you like just stuff like that love it I really really great advice what I think what agents if you want to think about a podcast it doesn't have to be interviewing somebody it doesn't have to be being super entertaining it just has to be useful so if you're if you think about what are my clients routinely ask me time and time and time again that those are those are episodes right there that's an episode say hey here's here's one of my frequently asked questions that you know most of my home buyers end up asking or homes you know or sellers etc um here's you know how to think about what neighborhoods might be the best fit or here you know anyway it really just giving people insight in how a REALTOR thinks I think is really important because because you obviously have wisdom experience knowledge that the person that you're representing does not have and so if you can sort of give that away for free at least some of it um you know and a lot of people might think well I don't want to give away my you know my my my my secret sauce and I'm like well your secret sauce is really you and it's all the things you do it's not really your knowledge your knowledge is a part of it but you can give your knowledge away for free and what what will happen is people look we live in a world where we expect content to be free so right yeah I mean whether it's social media or YouTube or wherever we we don't we don't yes you can pay you can pay for content most people don't so this idea is I mean this podcast is free of course so you know we if I started charging I'd I think I'd lose most of my audience no maybe yeah I could charge I could charge like yeah not this one no but I could it will yeah I guess I could charge guests but I don't feel right about that but but asking my audience to chip in is is certainly you know certainly reasonable but you know we just thankfully don't don't have to do that maybe someday we'll do that but for now you know again putting out this and REALTOR's never have to charge for content because they're using it as a way to market themselves so it's it's a really great idea you know consider even if it's just you know best restaurants in Wicker Park and that's your podcast and all you do is feature one restaurant a week and you go over and you talk to the owner and you record it I am telling you people are going to if if if you can tell people about it they are going to want to know things like that or you know we're gonna check out all the parks or or whenever whatever you're into like if you if you learn something new that day like for instance I just posted I was in my car and I just say that you might I was with my inspector same inspector I always use and he just he said something that put it that I knew that but he put it in such simple terms he's like you know there's six major components that house there's your roof windows HVAC plumbing electrical and windows and so I'm like he's like those of the six major functions so if you have at least four of those six that are in good working order usually that's that's a good you know a good sign thing and I literally hopped on Instagram and I was like he just put it in such simple terms so if you're a homeowner what are the six main components you want to always pay attention to and make sure that they are maintained enough to date and if you're a buyer these are the six main things that you should probably make sure are you know somewhat in control when you're buying a house like and again I I know those things but I'm like that's just such a great way to put it and so I just put it out there's a piece of advice like content can be anything it people I don't know is that some of the things that people watch so that almost keeps my those anxiety levels of like oh is this stupid opposed or oh is this like we all get that we all experience it is something I think that's human nature but if you just remember the ridiculousness that's out there and the amount of like just the worst content ever that's consumed like you're just another you know dropping the bucket and to me that is actually a little bit it makes me feel a little bit better like I'm just throwing that out there because you know it could be a lot of anxiety with that yeah I think you know having anxiety around any new skill that you're learning is totally normal and we need as as REALTORS or as any business professional or any just any human really we need to learn to be okay with being uncomfortable especially when we're learning a new skill because the only way we really learn is through failure and failure is of course not a lot of fun for most of us but it is the pathway to actually learning things and and applying them so this idea of having anxiety is like you got to get a lit not you Kelly but anyone who's wanting to you know learn a new skill whether it's having a buyer conversation about price or starting a podcast or you know deciding to work with investors which you know you're an investor yourself you know that's a whole decision because a lot of agents are like I don't really understand investment properties well okay maybe today you don't and if you want to build that into your practice you're going to want to learn those skills and it's going to be really uncomfortable and it's going to be a little scary and that's how you know it's actually how you know you're on the right track if it's a little scary you're on the right track I agree and that's something too that like it is a new agent even to this day like I never want to stop learning like I you should you should want to continue learning because there's even things like there's there's certain things about reality that I learned a news usually something new with every deal and it's great and that's all you can ask for it and that's again brings you back to mentorship because you know how I always say stuff and he did my first three deals it was just my voice because hey what is this or hey what do I do not so hey what like I mean she literally and there's no better way to learn at least for my brain is to be literally just coached through the process which is what I try to replicate to my clients and you can coach people through the process via a podcast as well so yeah so this there's really really great so speaking of your podcast it is REALTOR talk with Steph and Kell will have a link to that in our show notes also the website to work with Stephanie and her group is gold group at properties.com will have a link to that you can find Stephanie you can find Kelly well Stephanie's there too you can find Kelly you can find Kelly I'm looking at a picture of Stephanie when I'm saying that so I was I was her name came to mind but we of course talking to on there and please subscribe to our podcast please check out and if you're an agent in another part of the country who maybe has clients that move to Chicago or maybe you're in one of the markets where people move from Chicago to for example Florida is one of those places yeah Texas Arizona there's lots of you know South Carolina maybe there's lots of places that are we know that people retire to or maybe you know think about having a winter home and and if you are in those markets or you have people moving in and out of Chicago you should meet you should check check I'm sorry you should connect with Kelly to see if you would be a good match to pass the leads back and forth so Kelly what's the best way one of our age one of our listeners could I get in touch with you I would say Instagram is a great one and then also my my cellphone number my cellphone numbers all over my social self feel free really anyway you know I check all my dns I don't have anyone doing that for base so you know anyway and what's what's your Instagram it's Kelly Dugan underscore real estate Kelly Dugan underscore real estate on Instagram we'll have a link to that in the show notes as well Kelly thank you so much and by the way we should mention to you the reason Kelly came on to our radar is I think you did you reach out to us or am I wrong about that or did we reach out to you I talked about my real it with my podcast with that right so this is a this I knew there was something that you had done proactively and I just had forgotten because it's been months since since that happened and this is a really important thing Kelly reached out and now I'm sort of remembering it and you were like maybe you asked a question or you asked for some advice or help or or whatever and I think we got on the phone pretty quickly or vis-à-esail or whatever it was you know how many times I get asked for help on a podcast like almost never maybe once a year so it's this is also a great um you know the reason I'm bringing this up I think it's a great opportunity for all of our listeners to think about who in your local market do you really admire whether they work at your firm at a different firm it's probably better if it's even a different firm you know you can reach out to those people and say I really I really respect you know you and what your your businesses and I would love to buy you a cup of coffee and just pick your brain for 10 minutes if you have time or just you know ask you some questions it's the most flattering thing and I think we often think that these top producers are untouchable or and a lot of them some of them are I mean some of them are just too busy or they're just you know they don't have the time or want it you know the need to meet with you but a lot of them will and you you'd be surprised at how few people reach out to them for advice and guidance because we get a little intimidated by that but um Kelly was not in Tim I mean she should be like I love sharing I think there's enough business for everybody I think that the cut-propeness of this industry and like agents and everything like we have to all help each other because we're all gonna be on the other side and we're all shunned for the same goal so that business for everybody and I think ego will be like the first thing to honestly make your business go down in my opinion you do it this is a people business you have to whether that person's an agent whether that person anything you just your reputation's gonna follow you perfectly said and great place to wrap up so the podcast is REALTOR Talk with Steph and Kell look on our show notes reach out to Kelly you can find her Kelly do get underscore real estate that's on Instagram we'll have a link to that as well reach out to her ask her for her best tips and advice she would appreciate it and
