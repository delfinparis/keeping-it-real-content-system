[00:01:25] Are you looking for agents to join your brokerage or team?
[00:01:29] Now as a real estate recruiter, I can tell you the answer is always yes. But most agents aren't
[00:01:35] looking to move right now. So how do you know who to contact? Well, what if I were to tell you
[00:01:39] there's a recruiting and retention tool powered by artificial intelligence that shows you
[00:01:44] exactly which agents in your local market are looking to leave their brokerage right now and
[00:01:49] which agents at your own firm are also looking to leave you. Now I've been recruiting
[00:01:55] REALTORS for 15 years and I've hired over 2000 agents. I can tell you with no exaggeration,
[00:02:01] this is the tool I've been waiting for. Corded's AI looks for trends across dozens of variables
[00:02:06] for each agent in your market and shows you which agents they believe are likely to move. Not
[00:02:11] only does it do that, but corded's AI went and visited my recruiting website and read everything
[00:02:17] I offer. So now when I'm recruiting, corded's AI tells me exactly what to say based on that
[00:02:23] agent's needs and what my brokerage can offer. It even writes emails for me. I've never seen
[00:02:29] anything like it and I use it every single day. Now if you are looking to grow your brokerage,
[00:02:35] corded.io is the best tool out there. Visit corded.io to schedule a demo again. That's corded.io.

[00:04:22] agents. All right. Let's get right to it. My conversation with Lindsay Hahn.
[00:04:38] All right. Today, we're speaking with Lindsay Hahn with Christie's International Real Estate
[00:04:44] Sereno San Luis Obispo County in California. Let me tell you more about Lindsay. Now,
[00:04:50] Lindsay Hahn's real estate driven. Sorry, let me start that over. Lindsay Hahn's results driven

[00:06:04] welcome to the show. Welcome. Thank you so much for having me. I'm excited to be here. I'm excited
[00:06:11] to chat with you. So I have not been to San Luis Obispo because just for our audience to visualize
[00:06:19] where that is, it's kind of in the middle of San Francisco. It's on the coast, it's on the middle
[00:06:24] between San Francisco and L.A. Is that fair to say? Correct. Central Coast. If we got a little bit
[00:06:30] even closer we're in between Santa Barbara and Monterey. Well, I've been to Santa Barbara and I've
[00:06:36] been to Monterey. Perfect. Yeah. Yeah. Voters, I mean, everywhere around. Beautiful parts of the world.
[00:06:43] Just gorgeous. I love that you get to wake up every single day. I'm looking, by the way, if you're
[00:06:48] listening to this, you won't see this, but if you're watching us, you'll see the beautiful rolling
[00:06:53] mountains and hills behind Lindsay. It's just lush, green, beautiful, and what a great place.
[00:07:01] You know, it's funny. People are always get frustrated, especially right now. It's a frustrating
[00:07:06] time, I think, in real estate for a lot of agents, but at least it's good to be frustrated in beauty
[00:07:11] and nature. So you picked a great place to practice real estate. But let's talk about how you got to
[00:07:19] San Luis Obispo and why you set up shop there because you were not originally from that.
[00:07:24] Correct. So we're actually in a college town. It's called Cal Poly San Luis Obispo. And so
[00:07:31] I got into Cal Poly when I was 17 years old and came here for undergrad, majored in psychology.
[00:07:39] And as part of my degree, I graduated in four years. We had to stay on for an internship. And so
[00:07:46] I graduated, but I was on a living stipend with an AmeriCorps budget. So it was less than minimum wage
[00:07:54] to volunteer at these nonprofits and give back to the community, which was a super rewarding experience.
[00:08:01] But I sort of stuck around for this fifth year. Well, I wasn't really making any money, and I wasn't
[00:08:07] quite sure what I was going to do with my life, but I had to follow through with my commitments. And so
[00:08:12] I kind of accidentally got a job at a real estate office as the runner. So I'll take everybody back
[00:08:19] to 2008. This was July of 2008. It was not very glamorous. There was a lot of bankones. People
[00:08:29] in the industry were getting out of the industry as fast as they did. The market was thinking.
[00:08:33] Everything was tanking. And so I was like running around for $10 an hour, taking photos of the
[00:08:40] derelict listings, filling fire boxes, and just kind of doing the grant work cash for keys,
[00:08:48] just kind of doing it all for a real estate agent who I had worked with. And despite how
[00:08:54] unglamorous that sounds, I thought it was really fun. You're in college and you go from school to
[00:09:02] the restaurants, all this kids eat back to campus. And you stay in this like one to two mile radius.
[00:09:08] And being in real estate, I was driving to all these beautiful places that were outside of my bubble.
[00:09:14] And no day was the same. So I sort of fell in love with the variety and the amount of tasks that
[00:09:23] were involved in sort of that very, very entry level assistant. I love that. And so you got your taste
[00:09:29] for that in college. You were doing your, I guess you would call it an externship or your last
[00:09:34] year, sort of giving back to the community. But really seeing probably a side of San Luis Obispo
[00:09:41] that as a college student wouldn't have seen. So and you've got a sense for what real estate agents do
[00:09:47] and really in a difficult time during the market. So but I guess maybe not knowing any differently,
[00:09:54] maybe you didn't even recognize what a challenging time it was. Did you at that time, did you know
[00:09:59] sort of what was happening in real estate or were you just happy to have some employment?
[00:10:03] Yeah, I mean, so there were some more senior agents in the office and they're like, oh man,
[00:10:09] it sucks. You know, the title company, they can only give us pens now. They used to fly us in private
[00:10:14] jets. They would bring, you know, the coldest champagne and tequila to the office on Fridays.
[00:10:20] Everybody would just be cheering and toasting to all the success. And I was like, huh, I can't
[00:10:27] even get get them to get me a free pen or like an open house sign in sheet because, you know,
[00:10:33] everybody was on such budget cuts. So I honestly am super, super grateful timing is everything and
[00:10:41] how perfect of a time to learn when there was no place for complacency. And you saw fellow agents
[00:10:50] who had ridden their waves to success, losing their homes, short selling their personal residences.
[00:10:56] And it's not and as difficult as that is, I think it was a really great way to enter a new career
[00:11:02] and realize that every year, every week, every day is an opportunity, but there are no guarantees.
[00:11:09] It's going to be a hot market tomorrow. And so I think that really helped me realize I had to work
[00:11:15] really, really hard and understand the financials that real estate is cyclical and you don't want to
[00:11:23] be caught with a ton of debt on a down cycle. Yeah, it's something that we, all of us learned who
[00:11:32] were, you know, adults during that time and maybe owned property. We a lot of us went through a
[00:11:38] similar, you know, story there of whether it was our own personal property or primary residence
[00:11:42] or if we had investment properties. Certainly there were a lot of lessons learned. And yeah, it was,
[00:11:48] it was, it was a difficult time to go through. And I do sort of, you're right, timing is everything.
[00:11:53] This idea that this trial by fire put you in sort of the deepest part of the pool at the worst
[00:11:59] possible time when the lightning is going on all around you. And people are fleeing, you know,
[00:12:05] for cover and you were sort of like saying, oh, I don't know any difference. So this is just,
[00:12:11] this is my normal. And then when things get better, obviously, it probably seems like, oh, this is,
[00:12:17] this can be actually, you know, really not easy, of course, but certainly I've survived harder than
[00:12:22] this. So I think that that's really again, it's great timing. And when people leave, there's always
[00:12:28] opportunity. So, so okay, so you went straight in right out of college. Is that right?
[00:12:34] It's kind of an intern. And then sort of got my feet wet, realized I really enjoyed being here.
[00:12:41] So I was going to kind of take my career to the next level. So I ended up getting my real estate
[00:12:46] license. It again, wasn't really part of the plan. It just sort of fell into place as I was on this
[00:12:52] kind of journey of my fifth year after college figuring out what to do. So got licensed in 2009.
[00:12:59] And then started selling in 2010. So I was a buyer's agent on a small team at that time. And so
[00:13:09] really just running around, getting scrappy, very, very young at the time. I was probably 22 or 23
[00:13:16] years old and just hustling and trying to learn and preview and get as much knowledge as I could
[00:13:23] to help my buyers succeed in a challenging time. Yeah, I can't imagine that would be an easy task
[00:13:32] for a 22 year old because number one, of course, just having the knowledge to take someone around,
[00:13:38] takes time, it takes experience. And certainly too, when you were also in an area that is known for
[00:13:44] having, you know, high prices, that's also potentially a hurdle too. It's like, well, here's this
[00:13:50] 22 year old woman who is very scrappy. But, you know, but, but again, still that is a hurdle, right?
[00:13:57] Like people still look at a 22 year old differently than they look at a 55 year old woman. Like,
[00:14:02] that's just the reality of the world. So as for anyone out there who is a younger agent, who is maybe,
[00:14:09] you know, has those concerns about age. And I love hearing these stories because it really helps
[00:14:16] those agents who are thinking, oh, my age is a problem or my age, I can't seem to figure out how to
[00:14:22] sort of get past that. You know, can you share a little bit about what you did to sort of, you know,
[00:14:27] be able to just continue working even though you were so young? Yeah, so I think I had a gift that I
[00:14:33] I was never going to just teleclient something I didn't know the answer to. And so just being confident
[00:14:39] as, you know what, I'm going to make note of that and I'm going to get right back to you. And so
[00:14:43] I remember every time I would run into a challenge, I was on the phone with the title company. I
[00:14:49] mean, I was negotiating short sales for people at this time. You know, it was a whole new skill set
[00:14:55] that no college degree can really prepare you for. And so I just took detailed notes and then I'd
[00:15:02] call the title company or my escrow officer. And I'm like, come over and help me. What do we do? Let's
[00:15:13] go find the answer. And so I think I was confident that I could get the clients what they needed to
[00:15:19] know so that they could make a good decision. And I think they saw my dedication to doing what was
[00:15:26] right. And not just shoving them into a house that didn't meet their needs, not having that like
[00:15:32] commission breath or trying so hard that you come across as fake and really just trying to be
[00:15:38] super, super genuine and let them know that I was going to have their best interests at heart.
[00:15:45] And if I didn't know it, I was going to find it out for them. It's a great thing to have sort of
[00:15:50] holstered at all time this when I don't know the answer to something. I'm not going to
[00:15:56] stutter or stammer or give an answer that is an accurate, which I have been guilty of in other
[00:16:01] careers when I was at that age and I was starting out in totally a different industry. I remember
[00:16:07] giving an answer that wasn't accurate, but I felt like I had to give an answer. And what I wish I
[00:16:13] would have done back then is what you did is said, that is an amazing question. I'm going to double
[00:16:17] check with my team when you get right back to you because nobody really holds that ever against
[00:16:22] someone. As long as they're like, I'm going to get that answer right back to you. It's a perfectly
[00:16:26] acceptable response. And even though it might not feel great at the moment where you don't have that
[00:16:32] answer, it's really your best option at that point is to say not even to say I don't know. Just go,
[00:16:38] that's a great question. I'm going to double check. I'll get right back to you, hang on one second.
[00:16:42] And then you just go do the thing and get the information. And then sort of problem solved,
[00:16:48] or at least most of the time I think people would accept that. So that is a, it sounds like a simple
[00:16:53] tip, but it's actually a really important one because we don't like to say we don't know. And we
[00:16:59] don't have to say we don't know. We just have to say I'm going to double check. I'm going to,
[00:17:02] I'm going to just check with my team, make sure I get you the best possible answer. Come back and then
[00:17:06] you know, there you go. So I love that. I mean, it's just little tips like that that win the game,
[00:17:11] I think. So I appreciate you sharing that one. So okay. So you got through your first year,
[00:17:16] you're on a team. And you know, I'm assuming the team is feeding you to some degree, they're handing
[00:17:22] you opportunities. But are you started? Are you also out there trying to build your own business,
[00:17:27] trying to get your own traction? Yeah. So I kind of hustled as a buyer's agent for about eight
[00:17:34] years. And by doing that, and I think the benefit of being in a smaller community is word travels
[00:17:42] fast. So by like year four, five and six, I was working with a business coach and she's like,
[00:17:49] people don't shop with Lindsay. They call Lindsay when they are ready to buy. And just like that,
[00:17:55] I'll have found them their home. And so I worked really hard to sort of get my name out there. And I
[00:18:02] think it's the compound effect. You do something for years and years and you don't see the full
[00:18:08] reward of your effort. And then someday the phone just rings from a stranger, oh, I've heard about
[00:18:14] you and you're my person, when can we meet? I'm in the market to buy a home. And I think in a smaller
[00:18:21] community, that that kind of traction and word of mouth can really take off. So I started kind of
[00:18:28] quietly silently building a name for myself. And I wasn't even trying in a sense to market myself
[00:18:35] because I was busy hustling and showing, showing buyers. But I did write by my clients. And then
[00:18:43] all of that sort of starts to compound. And then the next thing you know, you're being a sought-out
[00:18:49] entity. And I didn't even know all that hustling was going to lead to that. I think sometimes you're
[00:18:55] just like, I'm just going to get through the year and pay my bills. And then you get a little bit
[00:18:59] better, a little more confident. And so I think the best thing that I did was being that buyer's agent
[00:19:06] for eight to 10 years. I've seen every type of home. I've seen every condo. I've seen every
[00:19:12] property on acreage. I became so familiar with this community that I wasn't originally from
[00:19:18] that I became an expert in the process. But yeah. No, you said a lot there. And it's funny too,
[00:19:26] because then we look at people like you, when that phone call comes in, where all of a sudden you
[00:19:31] are a brand, like kind of seemingly overnight to the observer who isn't paying that close of attention
[00:19:37] to all the late nights, all of the hard work that goes unnoticed. And to the untrained eye,
[00:19:45] it's like, oh, wow, look at her. She got lucky. She's like doing, and it's like, well,
[00:19:50] no, she had eight to 10 years of barely scraping and just hustling and doing, like you said,
[00:19:56] right by your client. And that's all people really ever want out of a service professional is
[00:20:02] do the right thing at the right time, you know, do the hard right thing at the right time, I think.
[00:20:08] And that's what people seem to respect and are attracted to. And you're right, the compound effect,
[00:20:12] it happens. And all of a sudden one day you do get those calls. And all of a sudden people are
[00:20:17] seeking you out because you have built up enough goodwill. And again, the rest of the agents who
[00:20:25] maybe weren't working as hard or weren't focused as much on that part of the business,
[00:20:30] they were maybe not needing to or not wanting to or didn't have that driver desire. And that's where,
[00:20:36] you know, the younger agent comes and gobbles up some business because they prove to the marketplace
[00:20:43] that, you know, they are worthy and they do it through, you know, lots of blood, sweat and tears.
[00:20:48] So I love the hustle because it is it's always it's always hard work. Everything's hard. And,
[00:20:54] you know, I think that's people look at top producers and all I talk to on the show are top producers.
[00:21:00] They look at top producers as somehow they just kind of magically appeared. And I don't I think
[00:21:04] logically people know that's not how it works. But they don't what they what they don't see on our show
[00:21:09] is as soon as we're done with the episode, the person goes back and is just grunching numbers,
[00:21:16] calling clients, doing the unglamerous, unfun. It's fun to be sort of talking on a podcast for an hour
[00:21:23] and, you know, that that's always cute and fun. And what they don't see is the other 11 hours of the day
[00:21:28] that they are not doing cute and fun things. They are literally servicing their clients, which is
[00:21:34] oftentimes not very glamorous. So I appreciate you sort of talking about that. So, okay,
[00:21:39] so you started building your own practice. You started sort of realizing that you could do this
[00:21:44] on your own. As a young person, you know, what we I guess, you know, you weren't so young at the
[00:21:49] by the time you really started doing it. But, you know, what were you doing to market yourself? So,
[00:21:54] I know you were doing great stuff for your clients. Was that all you were focused on or were you
[00:21:59] also out there like being prominent in the community? Yeah, I mean, I was well, so it's kind of hard.
[00:22:06] So for like the first five to six years, I didn't really take vacations or take all this time off.
[00:22:11] It was just like nose to the grindstone. And then as I built a little bit of success, you know, I
[00:22:17] started my career here on nonprofits. So I would still go out and and see people and and try to support
[00:22:24] the community whenever possible. But I didn't have a crazy booming social life because I worked and
[00:22:31] worked really consumed quite a bit of my time. It wasn't this balanced life. But when I made the
[00:22:38] decision to go out on my own in 2018 and start the Lindsay Harn Group, I had helped the other
[00:22:46] offices I had worked for in the past build their own brands and build their own, you know, social media
[00:22:53] and mail tramp and, you know, all the different tools. And so the first thing I did when I went out
[00:22:59] on my own is I hired a marketing consultant and I said, okay, tell me what I need to do. And then
[00:23:05] let's just get get everywhere on the internet so that people looking for a top agent in San
[00:23:12] Los Biscoe County can find me. So I was like, my clients is that I'm not going to have time to phone
[00:23:18] every single one of my 800 clients at that time. But I can send them a mail piece, make sure they
[00:23:25] know where I can be on Instagram, help Google and just make myself available so that the public
[00:23:32] could find me. We're in a super unique market because about 50% of the homes in San
[00:23:40] Lois are owned by non-owner occupants. So they may not even live in this county. And so I had to make
[00:23:47] a way so the people who are moving here from out of town or coming to get a beach home or maybe
[00:23:53] selling their investment property from the Central Valley that they could find somebody that they
[00:24:00] could relate to that could get the job done for them because I'm not going to meet these people
[00:24:05] at coffee. I'm not going to meet them out of fundraiser. They don't live here yet. And so
[00:24:11] really kind of focused on my digital presence and making sure people could find me
[00:24:18] what was key and sort of taking it to the next level. I'm curious too. So you have these, we'll call them,
[00:24:25] you know, typically high net worth individuals who are, this is a second home, a third home, a vacation
[00:24:31] home, maybe a primary residence, but maybe not like you said, half of it isn't. And understanding
[00:24:37] that they come in from other markets and that could be New York, it could be, you know, wherever,
[00:24:41] you know, you know your feeder markets. Was it important for you? I'm curious to develop
[00:24:47] relationships with agents in those markets who would be able to, they knew you, they liked you,
[00:24:53] they trusted you where they could send business down or was it, I'm so prominent on social, and I
[00:24:59] know it's not one or the other, but I'm curious what was more helpful was building that strong social
[00:25:05] presence and that online presence so that when somebody was looking at San Luis Obispo, you came up
[00:25:11] or was it more that you develop relationships with agents in the, you know, primaries areas where
[00:25:17] these clients came from? Yeah, that's a great question. I found like it's a pretty split down
[00:25:24] the middle agents will go with someone they know if they happen to have a relationship and then
[00:25:30] other agents will go, I have a formula, I do research and that's how they find the agents. So a good
[00:25:37] portion of my business was definitely agent referral and I think a lot of it came from different
[00:25:44] networking groups I was in, you know, going to conferences, different kinds of conferences, two,
[00:25:49] three, four a year, and then sending business back and forth and then just checking in with top
[00:25:56] agents in your feeder markets. I found, especially when I was really young and starting out,
[00:26:02] it was hard for me to find a peer group here because there weren't a lot of people my age working
[00:26:08] this hard, there weren't a lot of people my age that were successful in real estate and so it can
[00:26:14] kind of get lonely. It's in a small town you go, well, I'm competing against these people on a
[00:26:19] regular basis. So, so I'm kind of living alone at my office just working all the time and so
[00:26:26] I started building friendships with other top agents in our other markets and so when I have a
[00:26:32] tough day or a tough client and I go, oh, I really need a pep talk, I call them, they've been in the
[00:26:37] trenches that day too. They maybe have a win they can share with me and I probably now travel three to
[00:26:44] four times a year with top agents around the country because I can relate to them, they're my friends,
[00:26:49] they know what we all go through and if you're sitting by the pool or in a museum somewhere and you
[00:26:57] take out and get take a phone call for an emergency client, they don't care, they're not judging you,
[00:27:02] they know they've been there and and so I think one of the things I learned and definitely helped
[00:27:08] attribute to my successes, building a a peer group that that can help not only send you referrals
[00:27:17] but also just be a sounding board and a support group when you have hit a challenge or a wall that
[00:27:23] you need some sound advice and the best part if they're not local, they're not even your
[00:27:28] competition, they can give you their hey, call my social media person, call my marketer, call my lawyer,
[00:27:34] they'll help you get through this immediately and all of a sudden you're back on your feet and
[00:27:39] have solved this problem with the support of your friends. You know, you brought up a great,
[00:27:44] great point is that real estate can be a very lonely business and even if you're in a huge
[00:27:51] metro market like Chicago, we have 47, almost 47,000 REALTORS here and I suspect the well,
[00:27:58] we know this just in general, we look up loneliness statistics in the country just generally speaking
[00:28:04] even though we're so easily connected to one another digitally, but loneliness is actually a huge
[00:28:10] challenge right now for all of us and even though we're so digitally connected, we're not
[00:28:14] somehow getting what we need. So this idea of finding other people who are going through the same
[00:28:21] experience you're going through and in different markets, like you said, they're not competition,
[00:28:25] but they're having the same problems you're having, they're having the same experiences,
[00:28:29] they're they're going through the same challenges. Those are your people and you're right,
[00:28:35] it's not only oh my god, I'm not alone, but it's also we can help each other, like we're actually
[00:28:41] good for one another because we're going through these times and I can't do it all by myself,
[00:28:46] I need support, I need help and the other person of course is doing that and they get you, they
[00:28:51] understand you. So I think that is really a really strong point for anyone listening,
[00:28:57] if you do feel like you're going through this experience alone, well you're not alone in that
[00:29:02] thought, that feeling, but there are solutions to that, Lindsey just talked about one, you know,
[00:29:07] find other agents who are having experiences like yours, maybe in your market or outside,
[00:29:13] you know, this is what social media is good for us, you can actually find these people pretty easily
[00:29:18] and say, hey, you know, I need an accountability partner or I'm struggling with this thing and
[00:29:23] I'm in my second year in the business and I need somebody who's maybe in their third year in
[00:29:27] the business who's been through what I'm going through and it can help me and maybe I can help
[00:29:31] them in some way and yeah, it takes a village, right? And so I'm so glad you said that, really
[00:29:36] really powerful stuff, let's find our people, let's find our community, I love that.
[00:29:42] And then you know, again, you've continued to grow, you are now one of the top female agents,
[00:29:48] I don't even like to say female agents, it's almost like a little bit insulting to say female agent
[00:29:53] because of course most agents in this market or in this industry are actually women,
[00:29:59] more women than men, but you're one of just the top agents in the country, which I love,
[00:30:03] but I also love that you're one of the top female agents. I want to talk about sort of what that
[00:30:09] means to you, like how does that, what does that mean to you, by the way?
[00:30:14] Yeah, I think one of the most amazing things about real estate is you don't have to have a specific
[00:30:21] degree, like doctor or lawyer, I mean, you have certain requirements in order to hit that level
[00:30:28] and I think what is so amazing and inspiring about being in the real estate industry is,
[00:30:34] yes, the barrier to entry is low, but there's really nothing holding anybody back, you don't have to
[00:30:40] have a fancy degree, you don't have to have come from a certain socio-economic, there is
[00:30:46] opportunity for everyone and I think it's provided me an amazing life and I know that will continue,
[00:30:54] but I think the fact that there are no limits and you just have to stay positive put in the work
[00:31:01] and you can accomplish anything you want in this field and I don't think there's that many careers
[00:31:08] that are like that, you know, a lot of times you have to have 10-year or get a certain certification
[00:31:13] and in real estate there's so many ways you can be successful that can work for so many different
[00:31:20] personalities and I think that's a huge benefit of the industry and I just find it really inspiring
[00:31:28] that anybody can do what I did, I don't have a special background, I didn't come from any,
[00:31:36] you know, really wealthy family or anything like that, it was all about making opportunities and
[00:31:41] creating this career for yourself and I think for men and women that's incredible. On the women part,
[00:31:49] I have a lot of women in my family, nieces, I do have a few nephews but a lot of nieces and cousins
[00:31:56] and I just want to show them that anything is possible and it doesn't mean they have to be in real
[00:32:04] estate but I want to educate them on reaching their full potential, I think a lot of people skate
[00:32:12] by in a 9-5, they clock in, they clock out, they're semi-miserable, maybe they're lonely and why not
[00:32:19] do something that you're passionate about and take it to the next level and really make an impact
[00:32:25] whatever that career path is and so that brings me a ton of motivation and I feel like
[00:32:32] these little people are watching and I've got to show them what's possible.
[00:32:39] Yeah, I love that, that makes all the sense in the world. Let's talk about building strong partnerships
[00:32:45] because you know I want to talk about how that can actually create lead opportunities for you.
[00:32:53] So tell us about strong partnerships and how that leads to leads.
[00:32:57] Okay, I've worked with the same lender since 2009, he did my first loan or actually before I was
[00:33:06] even able to buy my house, he sat me down and gave me like a how to buy my first home and how
[00:33:12] much I needed to save and so since then we've probably exchanged 120 to 150 referrals back and
[00:33:23] forth since 2010 and so when he has an opportunity to refer out at two three four million dollar listing,
[00:33:32] he's giving out my name. When I have a client that's moving to the area that needs to get qualified,
[00:33:38] guess who I'm referring and so I think we can think of partnerships in our local community and then
[00:33:45] beyond and so I always think it makes the most sense to start building those partnerships right where
[00:33:51] you are in your market so you know every time we sell a house we put a home inspector to work,
[00:33:58] homeowners insurance, an escrow, a title, an appraiser, I mean there's all these people we touch in a
[00:34:04] transaction so why not treat them well, provide excellent service and build a relationship with
[00:34:12] every person you touch throughout the transaction because chances are in their sphere of influence,
[00:34:18] they're the expert that their friends and family are going to say hey I'm thinking about in a house
[00:34:23] to the home inspector what should I do what should I look for oh well you better call Lindsay
[00:34:27] and so starting starting in your own backyard and getting those referral sources I think is huge,
[00:34:36] the other benefit is they're a great knowledge source you know what I'm stuck I can't get homeowners
[00:34:41] insurance on this this property for my client it's going to blow up the deal okay let's call the
[00:34:47] insurance who's now my friend or at least a trusted partner and they're going to help me solve
[00:34:52] this problem but if I hadn't treated them well sent them referrals they may have bigger fish to fry
[00:34:58] and so I think if we can start on that local level and start tracking your numbers from a business
[00:35:05] I probably get 20 deals a year from vendors like just my local partners who are in the industry or
[00:35:14] some related lake of the industry and then you go a little wider like we started okay where are
[00:35:22] people that are moving to San Luis moving from I better go start talking to the top agents there
[00:35:31] and you know if you're traveling or passing through their market take them to coffee drop off a card
[00:35:36] I'm here for you any questions you have and just build that knowledge base and then all of a sudden
[00:35:44] you have 20 or 30 deals a year coming in from people you've networked networked with
[00:35:51] and all of a sudden you've got a duplicatable and repeatable business that can go year to year
[00:35:56] and continue to grow yeah I love I love everything you said I have a suggestion to add on to that
[00:36:03] so we know that when we go through a real estate transaction we touch all of these other industries
[00:36:08] all of these other a lot of times individual business owners we have attorneys, inspectors, appraisers,
[00:36:14] lenders etc and you know you as Lindsay said you want to of course do an amazing job for them
[00:36:20] and then tell them like I want to send you more business can I do that of course they'll say yes
[00:36:26] and then I would also suggest we ask each one of those hey what's the biggest challenge in your
[00:36:32] business right now just because maybe I have a solution for you and maybe you don't but the
[00:36:37] idea that knowing where someone is struggling it really is a great opportunity because it might be
[00:36:42] something you wouldn't have thought of and you might be able to help them solve that problem
[00:36:47] through a lot of different efforts and then you just keep track of that knowing that that person
[00:36:51] okay they need they need leads or they don't need leads they need somebody to help them with so maybe
[00:36:56] you have a solution because you know somebody that could help them solve a problem so I love that
[00:37:01] building those strong strategic partnerships is really such a it's such a missed opportunity
[00:37:06] you know every time we go to that closing table we should be thinking about all the people we touch
[00:37:11] it we should be having personal conversations with them saying thank you so much for being my
[00:37:15] partner on this I appreciate you and what can we how can we do more of this like what what do you
[00:37:20] need for me what could I give you and you know making it a win-win I want to talk about where we are
[00:37:26] currently and the the common sort of complaint I hear and I don't mean complaint in a negative way
[00:37:32] just the common reality that agents are struggling and frustrated with right now is well there's two
[00:37:38] obviously interest rates aren't exactly where anybody would prefer them to be when we had you know
[00:37:43] super low interest rates environments years ago but we're not there today and also inventory
[00:37:48] isn't where it was and we're just not seeing as many people you know post putting their homes
[00:37:53] per cell we have a lot of people at 3% mortgages that are perfectly happy where they are or they
[00:37:58] don't want to you know smooth so I want to talk about how do you win listings winning listings is
[00:38:03] harder than ever right now and how are you doing that in a low inventory market yeah I mean I think
[00:38:10] you have to have the mindset that no matter what someone's locked in at from an interest rate
[00:38:15] perspective there are people that have to move death divorce job transfer moving out of state I
[00:38:25] mean there are events where a lot of people are going to have to move so the first the first
[00:38:32] recommendation have as keep your mindset right someone is going to move in your market today so go
[00:38:37] find those people versus get stuck and depressed and in this negative self talk I think with all the
[00:38:46] industry changes that have happened I think sellers more than ever want an expert they want someone
[00:38:54] who is going to tell them what they need to do to sell their home that's going to communicate take
[00:39:01] things off their plate and manage the process so be the solution because a lot of people maybe aren't
[00:39:08] super excited that they have to move you know they they may be giving up their dream home because
[00:39:13] they got called back into work and they were living in paradise and and now they have to go back
[00:39:18] to an office and live in a busy town that they had sort of already mentally moved on from and so
[00:39:25] just be their support be their expert commit to doing what's right for them and then have a
[00:39:31] solution with all the commission changes and have a plan before you go in the listing when they bring up
[00:39:39] I guess I don't have to pay the buyer's agent anymore you know what Mr. Mrs. Seller you're absolutely
[00:39:44] right and let me take you through my worksheet on exactly what your options are and how other sellers
[00:39:51] in your positions are navigating this new challenge and and have the answer don't stumble
[00:39:56] through that because I have never had more conversations about commission than in the last six months
[00:40:02] because the sellers are reading the news and thinking they may not have to and they don't but I think
[00:40:09] in reality in most markets that that's not how it's actually kind of playing out and so have a
[00:40:17] solution be prepared and be confident when you are in a listing situation like that and this is
[00:40:24] a great opportunity for us to leverage AI I know we've probably heard so much about how AI can
[00:40:31] help agents and and I know we're maybe even a little sick of hearing about it but here's one way
[00:40:36] that you might not be utilizing it is have it run through these scenarios with these objections
[00:40:41] where people say hey I read this thing and apparently I don't have to pay the buyer's side anymore
[00:40:47] I'm I get to save you know two and a half percent or whatever the number might be
[00:40:51] and then you as the agent then now have to have a response to that it doesn't have to actually
[00:40:57] you know it doesn't have to be a counter but you have to number one meet them where they're at
[00:41:02] you have to explain yes I understand why you think that way and here's how it's really playing out
[00:41:07] today here's why it's playing out that way here's we'll go through the scenario here's what happens if
[00:41:11] you don't here's what happens if you do and to have the data to back that up and then practice it
[00:41:17] over and over and over again so that when somebody asks you it's like oh I have a great conversation
[00:41:23] piece around this let's talk about it let's go through the numbers let's explain to you what's
[00:41:27] actually happening what's actually changed and what it actually means to you the seller
[00:41:34] and I think I think this is chat GBT's like this is the one thing it's really really good at so you
[00:41:39] literally say it to it hey you know and now we can talk to chat GBT which is even cooler it's like
[00:41:44] you don't even have to type it out you could say I want to get better as a real estate agent with all
[00:41:48] the changes in the commission you know and you can probably by the way you can probably find if you
[00:41:53] look if you pay for chat GBT I think it's only on the paid model which is like 20 bucks a month it's
[00:41:58] really affordable you can literally search for like real estate coaches that will help real estate agents
[00:42:04] there's all they're already built like you don't even have to just like build it yourself and you
[00:42:08] could just say I want to get I want I want somebody to drill me I want somebody to raise these
[00:42:12] objections and then tell me score me tell me how am I doing on my objection objection handling does
[00:42:18] this make sense and what are other agents saying and you will you'll get the answers you don't even
[00:42:23] have to know the answers that's the best part just at ask chat GBT this is so funny we did a video
[00:42:28] this morning my my colleague recent I and we were talking about a tool on the MLS and I'm not a
[00:42:35] practicing agent so I really never use the MLS so so I might like dirty little secret as I don't
[00:42:39] practice so I don't really know the tools the REALTORS use even though I'd appears that I do
[00:42:44] because I have this popular show and we have 700 agents that are company so I'm talking about this
[00:42:49] tool that I legitimately have never used because I don't practice which makes sense but I have to
[00:42:54] talk about it and I have to be confident in how it works and thank God chat GBT told me exactly
[00:43:00] everything about it so I was able to kind of fake my way through a five minute video and that's
[00:43:05] not an ideal thing to do and if I actually had to present this to a real person then yeah I would
[00:43:11] learn it of course but but the point is is I just had to get through this video for for a training
[00:43:16] and the reality of it is is chat GBT is very helpful for the stuff so please consider using it this
[00:43:22] is what you know if you can't afford a real coach somebody that could drill you one to one then hey
[00:43:28] chat GBT it's it's 20 bucks a month and that's as cheap as an option as I've ever heard and it's
[00:43:33] not that bad it's it's a lot better than you might think okay on that one last note on how to win
[00:43:39] listing so my staff and marketing team I guess we feed chat GPT because I actually won a luxury
[00:43:49] listing last week and I was in the house with the seller and he said well this is who you're
[00:43:54] competing with and I just had chat GPT compare you and they had made like a tea chart on why they
[00:44:02] should pick me over this other very highly qualified agent in my market and chat GPT had more pros
[00:44:10] than cons for me versus this other agent but that's why it's so important to know your digital
[00:44:15] footprint because more people are going to say hey Siri call a local agent or hey Siri or you know
[00:44:22] and and all these things and that was just an example of how a seller made an important financial
[00:44:28] decision using the tools of chat GPT so feed the beast if if you can that is wild and and you know
[00:44:36] what it makes perfect sense because I do that too like I was looking for an ergonomic chair last night
[00:44:43] and obviously I could Google best ergonomic chairs which I did and then I went best ergonomic
[00:44:48] chairs read it because I trust the people on reddit a little bit more than what I might just find
[00:44:52] on a blog and then I'm like okay but I still don't know like what's the right one and I asked chat GPT
[00:44:58] and I have the paid version and it literally was like okay based on what we know about you DJ
[00:45:03] because I've been feeding an information about me and my health and all of that it said I we think
[00:45:08] this is these are the three options you should probably consider and I was like okay well it's
[00:45:13] better than I could have come up with and now I'm exploring those three options so you're absolutely
[00:45:16] right people are using it in that way I love the fact by the way that is a no cost referral to you
[00:45:22] but the cost of it is making sure like you said your digital footprint is really really intentional
[00:45:29] like you're the content you're pushing out there that chat GPT feeds from is full of really good
[00:45:35] information and full of great client reviews and all of the things that chat GPT because it's
[00:45:40] going to have to make a decision for this individual typing into the prompt who should I choose as my
[00:45:45] agent and if you have enough content out there it's not going to call your clients for you it's
[00:45:50] literally going to look through the data so ask all your clients for reviews it's more important
[00:45:55] than ever now to have them talk about their experience of working with you making sure that you're
[00:45:59] posting a lot on social as to and not just just listed just sold let's talk about the value we
[00:46:05] provide let's let's give people actual tips about how to best you know get their homes ready to
[00:46:11] sell or buy your tips or investor tips or whatever this is what social media is really good for us
[00:46:16] providing actual content and we all have a phone that can do things that you know thousands and
[00:46:23] thousands of dollars of cameras can do but you already have it in your phone you literally have it
[00:46:29] turn it around start talking to it and giving it you know put it posting that content so thank you
[00:46:34] Lindsay what a what a great great point and I love that I think you owe a come a referral check to
[00:46:39] open AI as so I love that that is so don't tell yeah yeah that's right no yeah well you
[00:46:46] and but it really is kind of funny you got a referral for free because you have such a great
[00:46:53] digital footprint I love that that's amazing now let's talk about tough client conversations because
[00:46:58] in the high net worth world and even in the you know middle or low net worth world we still have to
[00:47:04] have tough client conversations but how do you deal with tough conversations without losing the client
[00:47:11] without losing the deal you know I always try to get their buy-in from day one is can I be honest
[00:47:19] with you and so I got a call from a seller last night her home's on the market it's not with a
[00:47:25] luxury agent and she's like there's been it's been on the market for 78 days and I we've only had
[00:47:32] four showings and they weren't qualified and I am and I go can okay I'm going to go look at your
[00:47:40] house today after this call can I be brutally honest with you yet I've already looked at your
[00:47:47] photos that front photo it's not doing anything for me I have no idea what I'm looking at if I
[00:47:53] wear a buyer I would have no clue and make no request to see your home okay and and you have
[00:47:59] you have to have the tough conversations from day one because if you're and I'm not saying dishonest
[00:48:07] but if you're overly if you try to overly bond it in the beginning now this is your friend you're
[00:48:14] not the expert it's really hard then to say okay now we're not friends today I'm wearing my
[00:48:20] mean hat my expert hat and now I'm going to have to tell you your house is overpriced your dog
[00:48:26] bed smell and you've got to get a deep cleaned and wash your windows but now you've lost 75 days
[00:48:34] and now you're losing your credibility with that client and so I always try to stay super super
[00:48:40] professional and if we build a friendship or relationship it's always after the transactions
[00:48:46] over because they're calling you because they need an expert they don't want to test the market
[00:48:52] they want their home sold they're they've bought another home there is a deadline that they do not
[00:48:58] want to be paying two mortgages in this interest rate environment so so just get their permission
[00:49:04] from day one and speak with authority and then when you say it it's not personal it's I am the
[00:49:11] expert and this is what the data and the market is telling us and here is my recommendation
[00:49:18] talk to your husband talk to your wife let's regroup in the next 48 hours once you've had
[00:49:23] to process this and and just get their permission to be honest and and have confidence I love that
[00:49:30] there's a great expression with friends that I always thought was a good thing to remember is I like
[00:49:36] you enough to tell you the truth like it's actually the most respectful thing you can do is to tell
[00:49:43] somebody the truth that they can't see and it's not easy and it's not always fun and like you said
[00:49:49] you ask permission because that's the right thing to do before you're about to tell somebody something
[00:49:54] that likely they don't want to hear and you know some people respond well to it some people don't
[00:50:00] but you're getting there by and say hey I've got some news to deliver that's really important
[00:50:06] may I deliver that news to you yes you may okay here's the here's the truth is X you know
[00:50:13] you're that first picture is driving people away it's not a good picture people people are so
[00:50:19] short attention span that they see that first picture and they just go well I guess this place sucks
[00:50:26] people shouldn't be that way it stinks that they are but they are so we're gonna get that fixed
[00:50:31] for you we're gonna do X Y and Z I love that and people appreciate honesty it even when it's hard
[00:50:38] and the people that don't appreciate it you really don't probably want them as a client anyway
[00:50:42] because they're not gonna listen to you and the home's gonna stay on the market for another 75
[00:50:47] days because they don't see the reality and you've told them the reality I love that though but I
[00:50:52] love the fact that you ask permission first because you do need permission to tell people the hard
[00:50:57] truth and once they give you that permission I'll bet you 95% of the time they're open to making
[00:51:03] those changes because they go wow she respects me enough to tell me something that I don't want to
[00:51:09] hear I mean people when they reflect back on that they respect that about agents I think well and
[00:51:15] you're looking out for their best interest and I would say no if you were my brother my aunt my
[00:51:20] uncle my cousin this is what I would say and do so I'm gonna treat you on that same level and
[00:51:28] if you only take 90% of my input and not 100 that's fine but this is the exact same advice I
[00:51:35] would give my best friend and that you know I want you to know I have that best interest in mind and
[00:51:41] I think that goes a long way and yeah they appreciate it in the long run you know it's so funny
[00:51:50] we talk about these things as if they're just so easy to do these you're not easy things to do
[00:51:57] people we we get it we know it is not easy to tell somebody their beloved home is not as
[00:52:03] beloved to you as it might be to them and to the public and there's a problem here or that it's
[00:52:09] over price in fact I want to talk about that let's talk about pricing the home correctly which is
[00:52:14] probably the most challenging thing I think a REALTOR can do with a listing because even
[00:52:21] even myself as somebody who is kind of in the industry and certainly aware of the pitfalls
[00:52:26] that list that owners have about over you know over valuing their property I went I had the same
[00:52:35] same exact experience maybe like 10 years ago when I was selling a condo I knew that people like
[00:52:41] myself would think it's worth more than it is and I still priced it higher than I should have
[00:52:46] and I had to have a you know a very honest conversation with myself very quickly like oh yeah okay
[00:52:53] that's not working that's not a good idea so let's talk about pricing the home properly what is your
[00:52:57] strategy to do that yeah I mean I I think a lot of times right now at least in California like
[00:53:04] I'm meeting with people in February or January and we're putting their house on the market in April
[00:53:10] and so at that listing appointment we talk about price and I say look I don't have a crystal ball
[00:53:17] our first impression is key our first impression is the photos the video the marketing materials
[00:53:24] and the price and so right now we're penciling in a price of X and we're signing this contract
[00:53:30] but one week before we hit the market we are going to sit back down run a new CMA and we are
[00:53:37] going to fine tune it because it does make all the difference does you know and get their buy
[00:53:42] in on that I go in a perfect world the market will be the same or slightly better I can't control
[00:53:48] what's going to happen in the future so we need to to readjust and be willing to to do that
[00:53:54] I think there's also in the Superhion sometimes we'll test it we'll have it as a pocket listing show
[00:54:01] a couple buyers we know who are looking and get their objections and their feedback before we're
[00:54:07] publicly listed on the MLS and that way I can go to the seller look this one or two things are going
[00:54:14] keep coming up as objections so we need to fix it find a solution or or price it into our final
[00:54:22] price and I think people like in the Superhion to sort of know about something a little bit early to
[00:54:30] to have this exclusivity and so I think that's a win for the potential buyers the potential sellers
[00:54:37] and for the listing agent and if you don't have buyers in the price range maybe you grab your
[00:54:42] office mates and you say look I'd like your unbiased opinion get back to me I will give you early
[00:54:49] access to see this incredible property I'm just going to ask you spend five minutes privately after
[00:54:55] the viewing and get back to me with what the list price should be and what you think it'll actually
[00:55:00] sell for an exchange you're providing them something of value that the rest of the market doesn't
[00:55:05] have early access to and so that is a great tip what a great idea especially the low inventory
[00:55:13] environment I love nobody nobody has ever shared that tip in our 600 and whatever episodes we've
[00:55:20] done over seven years that is an amazing tip so I just want to reiterate what what Lindsey just
[00:55:24] said because that was brilliant so what she said is hey I want to make sure my pricing is accurate
[00:55:29] here you say this to other agents and you say as a thank you to you for coming to check out the
[00:55:34] property you know you'll have sort of first look at it and but I really need your input I need you
[00:55:40] to think about you put your buyer hat on take a look tell me what you think this home is actually
[00:55:45] worth what you think it's going to sell for because one of you guys is going to probably bring a
[00:55:49] briar for it anyway and I want to make sure that I'm you know I'm not missing something so boy that
[00:55:55] is brilliant oh boy I love that you really do take a lot of advice you you take advice from your
[00:56:02] peers you take advice from clients I just love that you you're very very wise I think it's very smart
[00:56:09] to do that so wow well I want to finish with one thing which is lots of people want to become top
[00:56:16] producers and of course who doesn't want to be a top producer but let's talk about what's the
[00:56:22] reality of a top producer so give us the reality of of of being a top agent well I think a lot of
[00:56:29] people think I'm going to get into real estate is sort of this part time flexible career I can you
[00:56:34] know raise a family I can maybe have another job and I'm just going to sort of do that for for fun
[00:56:41] or for hobby or to supplement my income I think the hard part with that is once you actually gain
[00:56:47] traction and start getting clients particularly in a low inventory market it's 24-7 buyers
[00:56:55] have their own alert set on Zillow Redfin their website a choice you have to constantly prove to
[00:57:03] your clients that you're providing more value than the internet their cell phone chat GPT that
[00:57:09] they have access to already so that requires a full time and a half I always say I have I
[00:57:16] work full time and a half about 60-70 hours a week because if you're going to be a top producer
[00:57:22] you have to generate business every day you have to maintain client relationships every day you have
[00:57:28] to work through challenges on escrow's problems that come up you have to be networking with other agents
[00:57:35] you have to be in charge of marketing advertising and doing it all again the next day and so if you
[00:57:42] want to be setting boundaries like you can call or text me between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m. and otherwise
[00:57:48] I will return your call the next business day real estate is a 24-7 business I've done deals on
[00:57:54] Easter I've done deals on Christmas Eve they're when the right property and the right opportunity
[00:58:00] comes up in a low inventory market you've got to be able to pounce and so it's it's key to set your
[00:58:09] schedule and your expectations that if you are going to be a top producer there will be late nights
[00:58:14] there will be early mornings the payoff in the end for a lot of people will be worth it but it's
[00:58:20] certainly not for everybody yeah it's a sacrifice all of it's a sacrifice and you don't get the
[00:58:27] perfectly balanced home and work and social life it's just first of all I don't know that perfectly
[00:58:35] balances even a real thing so the quest for that I think is is a bit erroneous in nature but if
[00:58:41] you want to be a top producer you are going to work a lot of hours it's just the unfortunately the
[00:58:47] way of the way of the the the dragon right it's just how it goes but the rewards are really great
[00:58:54] so you get to have great rewards but at great sacrifice but at the same time you know you have
[00:59:00] established a balance for yourself you you can tell you are a seemingly sort of peaceful person
[00:59:08] you seem relatively accepting of kind of what the reality is you're you're not I was speaking to you
[00:59:15] before we started and you know you didn't seem stressed about inventory or interest rates you just
[00:59:22] you have a plan you're like I'm just working my plan I'm doing the thing I always do which is work
[00:59:26] really really hard and maybe I'll work the next agent a little bit and just have fun along the
[00:59:32] way too which is really part of it and just you know decide to keep going so I love that I think
[00:59:40] that is really good advice you know there's there's this great story I can't remember the name
[00:59:45] of there was a famous violinist and at a party in New York City like 30 years ago somebody came
[00:59:51] up to them at a cocktail party and they knew who that person was and said oh my gosh I wish I could
[00:59:56] play the violin like you and he said no you don't because you didn't because if you did you would
[01:00:03] know that it's so much work that you trust me you wouldn't want to do it if you wanted to do it you
[01:00:10] would do it he's like this is this is what I do this is my entire life and it didn't he didn't
[01:00:16] mean it to say that he has a bad life he has a great life he's a this world renowned violinist
[01:00:20] but it becomes an obsession it becomes their life and you know the willingness to put in that
[01:00:26] kind of work is what the good news is for people that are willing to put in the work it's not that
[01:00:31] crowded there's not that many people really doing that of course there's always people coming up
[01:00:37] behind you but that's great for you know competition and all of that so I appreciate that and by
[01:00:43] the way it's okay to not to want to be a top producer too if you want more balance in your life
[01:00:49] maybe top producer isn't the thing and maybe that's a good idea that's certainly not for everybody
[01:00:54] but if you do want to go down that path you have to recognize and just you know what I always say is
[01:00:59] go hang out with the top producer for a week see what their schedule is like it will floor you it will
[01:01:04] absolutely floor you and you'll and then you'll see why enjoy this kind of schedule is this for me
[01:01:11] if it isn't then that's not for you but what's really cool is when you know and I find this I've
[01:01:18] almost found this exclusively with top agents they seem to really love it there's something about it
[01:01:24] that something about real estate that it seems to be worth all the hard work for a top agents like I
[01:01:31] don't I really don't talk to top agents who are miserable maybe they just don't be on my show
[01:01:35] or I find them I really don't do that I know there's other professions I've talked to really
[01:01:41] successful attorneys that are miserable I've talked to successful doctors that are miserable I
[01:01:45] don't know what it is about real estate but there's something about it I know it's not less work
[01:01:49] so I know there's something about it that people who are attracted to becoming a high producer
[01:01:54] seem to really like it so and what what a blessing that is like to actually like the thing that
[01:02:00] you're doing all the time you know I don't think if if I was a doctor I wouldn't be a very good
[01:02:05] one number one but number two I don't think I'd want to see a patient every 15 minutes and most
[01:02:09] doctors that's how it works and that's a tough grind for 50 years so you know we think about oh well
[01:02:16] you know these these professions they're just they have so much reward it's like well yeah but there's
[01:02:21] a lot of work involved but I think real estate like you were saying earlier it's very merit-based it's
[01:02:27] it's very much it's kind of like sports in a way in a way and I don't want to totally compare it
[01:02:33] to sports but I think there is a connection there when we look at athletes and we think well you just
[01:02:38] have to be the best and if you're the best it doesn't matter what you look like as long as you're
[01:02:43] the best you could probably make it in a professional you know sports league and the same thing here
[01:02:49] in real estate as long as you have a good plan and you execute it and you get feedback and you keep
[01:02:54] trying you're probably going to do okay so I think that's there's something very magical about
[01:02:59] this industry and not every industry is like that like you could be the best you know any other
[01:03:05] industry sort of you know person and not reap a lot of rewards so I think real estate is very
[01:03:12] merit sort of focused and anyway you've given me you've given me some things to think about for
[01:03:16] myself so Lindsay I appreciate you you are doing doing it and I know as soon as we finish this
[01:03:22] episode you're gonna go back to doing it so we appreciate you taking time out of your day and

Now as a real estate recruiter, I can tell you the answer is always yes. But most agents aren't looking to move right now. So how do you know who to contact? Well, what if I were to tell you there's a recruiting and retention tool powered by artificial intelligence that shows you exactly which agents in your local market are looking to leave their brokerage right now and which agents at your own firm are also looking to leave you. Now I've been recruiting REALTORS for 15 years and I've hired over 2000 agents. I can tell you with no exaggeration, this is the tool I've been waiting for. Corded's AI looks for trends across dozens of variables for each agent in your market and shows you which agents they believe are likely to move. Not only does it do that, but corded's AI went and visited my recruiting website and read everything I offer. So now when I'm recruiting, corded's AI tells me exactly what to say based on that agent's needs and what my brokerage can offer. It even writes emails for me.

Thank you so much for having me. I'm excited to be here. I'm excited to chat with you. So I have not been to San Luis Obispo because just for our audience to visualize where that is, it's kind of in the middle of San Francisco. It's on the coast, it's on the middle between San Francisco and L.A. Is that fair to say? Correct. Central Coast. If we got a little bit even closer we're in between Santa Barbara and Monterey. Well, I've been to Santa Barbara and I've been to Monterey. Perfect. Yeah. Yeah. Voters, I mean, everywhere around. Beautiful parts of the world. Just gorgeous. I love that you get to wake up every single day. I'm looking, by the way, if you're listening to this, you won't see this, but if you're watching us, you'll see the beautiful rolling mountains and hills behind Lindsay. It's just lush, green, beautiful, and what a great place. You know, it's funny. People are always get frustrated, especially right now. It's a frustrating time, I think, in real estate for a lot of agents, but at least it's good to be frustrated in beauty and nature. So you picked a great place to practice real estate. But let's talk about how you got to San Luis Obispo and why you set up shop there because you were not originally from that. Correct. So we're actually in a college town. It's called Cal Poly San Luis Obispo. And so I got into Cal Poly when I was 17 years old and came here for undergrad, majored in psychology. And as part of my degree, I graduated in four years. We had to stay on for an internship. And so I graduated, but I was on a living stipend with an AmeriCorps budget. So it was less than minimum wage to volunteer at these nonprofits and give back to the community, which was a super rewarding experience. But I sort of stuck around for this fifth year. Well, I wasn't really making any money, and I wasn't quite sure what I was going to do with my life, but I had to follow through with my commitments. And so I kind of accidentally got a job at a real estate office as the runner. So I'll take everybody back to 2008. This was July of 2008. It was not very glamorous. There was a lot of bankones. People in the industry were getting out of the industry as fast as they did. The market was thinking. Everything was tanking. And so I was like running around for $10 an hour, taking photos of the derelict listings, filling fire boxes, and just kind of doing the grant work cash for keys, just kind of doing it all for a real estate agent who I had worked with. And despite how unglamorous that sounds, I thought it was really fun. You're in college and you go from school to the restaurants, all this kids eat back to campus. And you stay in this like one to two mile radius. And being in real estate, I was driving to all these beautiful places that were outside of my bubble. And no day was the same. So I sort of fell in love with the variety and the amount of tasks that were involved in sort of that very, very entry level assistant. I love that. And so you got your taste for that in college. You were doing your, I guess you would call it an externship or your last year, sort of giving back to the community. But really seeing probably a side of San Luis Obispo that as a college student wouldn't have seen. So and you've got a sense for what real estate agents do and really in a difficult time during the market. So but I guess maybe not knowing any differently, maybe you didn't even recognize what a challenging time it was. Did you at that time, did you know sort of what was happening in real estate or were you just happy to have some employment? Yeah, I mean, so there were some more senior agents in the office and they're like, oh man, it sucks. You know, the title company, they can only give us pens now. They used to fly us in private jets. They would bring, you know, the coldest champagne and tequila to the office on Fridays. Everybody would just be cheering and toasting to all the success. And I was like, huh, I can't even get get them to get me a free pen or like an open house sign in sheet because, you know, everybody was on such budget cuts. So I honestly am super, super grateful timing is everything and how perfect of a time to learn when there was no place for complacency. And you saw fellow agents who had ridden their waves to success, losing their homes, short selling their personal residences. And it's not and as difficult as that is, I think it was a really great way to enter a new career and realize that every year, every week, every day is an opportunity, but there are no guarantees. It's going to be a hot market tomorrow. And so I think that really helped me realize I had to work really, really hard and understand the financials that real estate is cyclical and you don't want to be caught with a ton of debt on a down cycle. Yeah, it's something that we, all of us learned who were, you know, adults during that time and maybe owned property. We a lot of us went through a similar, you know, story there of whether it was our own personal property or primary residence or if we had investment properties. Certainly there were a lot of lessons learned. And yeah, it was, it was, it was a difficult time to go through. And I do sort of, you're right, timing is everything. This idea that this trial by fire put you in sort of the deepest part of the pool at the worst possible time when the lightning is going on all around you. And people are fleeing, you know, for cover and you were sort of like saying, oh, I don't know any difference. So this is just, this is my normal. And then when things get better, obviously, it probably seems like, oh, this is, this can be actually, you know, really not easy, of course, but certainly I've survived harder than this. So I think that that's really again, it's great timing. And when people leave, there's always opportunity. So, so okay, so you went straight in right out of college. Is that right? It's kind of an intern. And then sort of got my feet wet, realized I really enjoyed being here. So I was going to kind of take my career to the next level. So I ended up getting my real estate license. It again, wasn't really part of the plan. It just sort of fell into place as I was on this kind of journey of my fifth year after college figuring out what to do. So got licensed in 2009. And then started selling in 2010. So I was a buyer's agent on a small team at that time. And so really just running around, getting scrappy, very, very young at the time. I was probably 22 or 23 years old and just hustling and trying to learn and preview and get as much knowledge as I could to help my buyers succeed in a challenging time. Yeah, I can't imagine that would be an easy task for a 22 year old because number one, of course, just having the knowledge to take someone around, takes time, it takes experience. And certainly too, when you were also in an area that is known for having, you know, high prices, that's also potentially a hurdle too. It's like, well, here's this 22 year old woman who is very scrappy. But, you know, but, but again, still that is a hurdle, right? Like people still look at a 22 year old differently than they look at a 55 year old woman. Like, that's just the reality of the world. So as for anyone out there who is a younger agent, who is maybe, you know, has those concerns about age. And I love hearing these stories because it really helps those agents who are thinking, oh, my age is a problem or my age, I can't seem to figure out how to sort of get past that. You know, can you share a little bit about what you did to sort of, you know, be able to just continue working even though you were so young? Yeah, so I think I had a gift that I I was never going to just teleclient something I didn't know the answer to. And so just being confident as, you know what, I'm going to make note of that and I'm going to get right back to you. And so I remember every time I would run into a challenge, I was on the phone with the title company. I mean, I was negotiating short sales for people at this time. You know, it was a whole new skill set that no college degree can really prepare you for. And so I just took detailed notes and then I'd call the title company or my escrow officer. And I'm like, come over and help me. What do we do? Let's go find the answer. And so I think I was confident that I could get the clients what they needed to know so that they could make a good decision. And I think they saw my dedication to doing what was right. And not just shoving them into a house that didn't meet their needs, not having that like commission breath or trying so hard that you come across as fake and really just trying to be super, super genuine and let them know that I was going to have their best interests at heart. And if I didn't know it, I was going to find it out for them. It's a great thing to have sort of holstered at all time this when I don't know the answer to something. I'm not going to stutter or stammer or give an answer that is an accurate, which I have been guilty of in other careers when I was at that age and I was starting out in totally a different industry. I remember giving an answer that wasn't accurate, but I felt like I had to give an answer. And what I wish I would have done back then is what you did is said, that is an amazing question. I'm going to double check with my team when you get right back to you because nobody really holds that ever against someone. As long as they're like, I'm going to get that answer right back to you. It's a perfectly acceptable response. And even though it might not feel great at the moment where you don't have that answer, it's really your best option at that point is to say not even to say I don't know. Just go, that's a great question. I'm going to double check. I'll get right back to you, hang on one second. And then you just go do the thing and get the information. And then sort of problem solved, or at least most of the time I think people would accept that. So that is a, it sounds like a simple tip, but it's actually a really important one because we don't like to say we don't know. And we don't have to say we don't know. We just have to say I'm going to double check. I'm going to, I'm going to just check with my team, make sure I get you the best possible answer. Come back and then you know, there you go. So I love that. I mean, it's just little tips like that that win the game, I think. So I appreciate you sharing that one. So okay. So you got through your first year, you're on a team. And you know, I'm assuming the team is feeding you to some degree, they're handing you opportunities. But are you started? Are you also out there trying to build your own business, trying to get your own traction? Yeah. So I kind of hustled as a buyer's agent for about eight years. And by doing that, and I think the benefit of being in a smaller community is word travels fast. So by like year four, five and six, I was working with a business coach and she's like, people don't shop with Lindsay. They call Lindsay when they are ready to buy. And just like that, I'll have found them their home. And so I worked really hard to sort of get my name out there. And I think it's the compound effect. You do something for years and years and you don't see the full reward of your effort. And then someday the phone just rings from a stranger, oh, I've heard about you and you're my person, when can we meet? I'm in the market to buy a home. And I think in a smaller community, that that kind of traction and word of mouth can really take off. So I started kind of quietly silently building a name for myself. And I wasn't even trying in a sense to market myself because I was busy hustling and showing, showing buyers. But I did write by my clients. And then all of that sort of starts to compound. And then the next thing you know, you're being a sought-out entity. And I didn't even know all that hustling was going to lead to that. I think sometimes you're just like, I'm just going to get through the year and pay my bills. And then you get a little bit better, a little more confident. And so I think the best thing that I did was being that buyer's agent for eight to 10 years. I've seen every type of home. I've seen every condo. I've seen every property on acreage. I became so familiar with this community that I wasn't originally from that I became an expert in the process. But yeah. No, you said a lot there. And it's funny too, because then we look at people like you, when that phone call comes in, where all of a sudden you are a brand, like kind of seemingly overnight to the observer who isn't paying that close of attention to all the late nights, all of the hard work that goes unnoticed. And to the untrained eye, it's like, oh, wow, look at her. She got lucky. She's like doing, and it's like, well, no, she had eight to 10 years of barely scraping and just hustling and doing, like you said, right by your client. And that's all people really ever want out of a service professional is do the right thing at the right time, you know, do the hard right thing at the right time, I think. And that's what people seem to respect and are attracted to. And you're right, the compound effect, it happens. And all of a sudden one day you do get those calls. And all of a sudden people are seeking you out because you have built up enough goodwill. And again, the rest of the agents who maybe weren't working as hard or weren't focused as much on that part of the business, they were maybe not needing to or not wanting to or didn't have that driver desire. And that's where, you know, the younger agent comes and gobbles up some business because they prove to the marketplace that, you know, they are worthy and they do it through, you know, lots of blood, sweat and tears. So I love the hustle because it is it's always it's always hard work. Everything's hard. And, you know, I think that's people look at top producers and all I talk to on the show are top producers. They look at top producers as somehow they just kind of magically appeared. And I don't I think logically people know that's not how it works. But they don't what they what they don't see on our show is as soon as we're done with the episode, the person goes back and is just grunching numbers, calling clients, doing the unglamerous, unfun. It's fun to be sort of talking on a podcast for an hour and, you know, that that's always cute and fun. And what they don't see is the other 11 hours of the day that they are not doing cute and fun things. They are literally servicing their clients, which is oftentimes not very glamorous. So I appreciate you sort of talking about that. So, okay, so you started building your own practice. You started sort of realizing that you could do this on your own. As a young person, you know, what we I guess, you know, you weren't so young at the by the time you really started doing it. But, you know, what were you doing to market yourself? So, I know you were doing great stuff for your clients. Was that all you were focused on or were you also out there like being prominent in the community? Yeah, I mean, I was well, so it's kind of hard. So for like the first five to six years, I didn't really take vacations or take all this time off. It was just like nose to the grindstone. And then as I built a little bit of success, you know, I started my career here on nonprofits. So I would still go out and and see people and and try to support the community whenever possible. But I didn't have a crazy booming social life because I worked and worked really consumed quite a bit of my time. It wasn't this balanced life. But when I made the decision to go out on my own in 2018 and start the Lindsay Harn Group, I had helped the other offices I had worked for in the past build their own brands and build their own, you know, social media and mail tramp and, you know, all the different tools. And so the first thing I did when I went out on my own is I hired a marketing consultant and I said, okay, tell me what I need to do. And then let's just get get everywhere on the internet so that people looking for a top agent in San Los Biscoe County can find me. So I was like, my clients is that I'm not going to have time to phone every single one of my 800 clients at that time. But I can send them a mail piece, make sure they know where I can be on Instagram, help Google and just make myself available so that the public could find me. We're in a super unique market because about 50% of the homes in San Lois are owned by non-owner occupants. So they may not even live in this county. And so I had to make a way so the people who are moving here from out of town or coming to get a beach home or maybe selling their investment property from the Central Valley that they could find somebody that they could relate to that could get the job done for them because I'm not going to meet these people at coffee. I'm not going to meet them out of fundraiser. They don't live here yet. And so really kind of focused on my digital presence and making sure people could find me what was key and sort of taking it to the next level. I'm curious too. So you have these, we'll call them, you know, typically high net worth individuals who are, this is a second home, a third home, a vacation home, maybe a primary residence, but maybe not like you said, half of it isn't. And understanding that they come in from other markets and that could be New York, it could be, you know, wherever, you know, you know your feeder markets. Was it important for you? I'm curious to develop relationships with agents in those markets who would be able to, they knew you, they liked you, they trusted you where they could send business down or was it, I'm so prominent on social, and I know it's not one or the other, but I'm curious what was more helpful was building that strong social presence and that online presence so that when somebody was looking at San Luis Obispo, you came up or was it more that you develop relationships with agents in the, you know, primaries areas where these clients came from? Yeah, that's a great question. I found like it's a pretty split down the middle agents will go with someone they know if they happen to have a relationship and then other agents will go, I have a formula, I do research and that's how they find the agents. So a good portion of my business was definitely agent referral and I think a lot of it came from different networking groups I was in, you know, going to conferences, different kinds of conferences, two, three, four a year, and then sending business back and forth and then just checking in with top agents in your feeder markets. I found, especially when I was really young and starting out, it was hard for me to find a peer group here because there weren't a lot of people my age working this hard, there weren't a lot of people my age that were successful in real estate and so it can kind of get lonely. It's in a small town you go, well, I'm competing against these people on a regular basis. So, so I'm kind of living alone at my office just working all the time and so I started building friendships with other top agents in our other markets and so when I have a tough day or a tough client and I go, oh, I really need a pep talk, I call them, they've been in the trenches that day too. They maybe have a win they can share with me and I probably now travel three to four times a year with top agents around the country because I can relate to them, they're my friends, they know what we all go through and if you're sitting by the pool or in a museum somewhere and you take out and get take a phone call for an emergency client, they don't care, they're not judging you, they know they've been there and and so I think one of the things I learned and definitely helped attribute to my successes, building a a peer group that that can help not only send you referrals but also just be a sounding board and a support group when you have hit a challenge or a wall that you need some sound advice and the best part if they're not local, they're not even your competition, they can give you their hey, call my social media person, call my marketer, call my lawyer, they'll help you get through this immediately and all of a sudden you're back on your feet and have solved this problem with the support of your friends. You know, you brought up a great, great point is that real estate can be a very lonely business and even if you're in a huge metro market like Chicago, we have 47, almost 47,000 REALTORS here and I suspect the well, we know this just in general, we look up loneliness statistics in the country just generally speaking even though we're so easily connected to one another digitally, but loneliness is actually a huge challenge right now for all of us and even though we're so digitally connected, we're not somehow getting what we need. So this idea of finding other people who are going through the same experience you're going through and in different markets, like you said, they're not competition, but they're having the same problems you're having, they're having the same experiences, they're they're going through the same challenges. Those are your people and you're right, it's not only oh my god, I'm not alone, but it's also we can help each other, like we're actually good for one another because we're going through these times and I can't do it all by myself, I need support, I need help and the other person of course is doing that and they get you, they understand you. So I think that is really a really strong point for anyone listening, if you do feel like you're going through this experience alone, well you're not alone in that thought, that feeling, but there are solutions to that, Lindsey just talked about one, you know, find other agents who are having experiences like yours, maybe in your market or outside, you know, this is what social media is good for us, you can actually find these people pretty easily and say, hey, you know, I need an accountability partner or I'm struggling with this thing and I'm in my second year in the business and I need somebody who's maybe in their third year in the business who's been through what I'm going through and it can help me and maybe I can help them in some way and yeah, it takes a village, right? And so I'm so glad you said that, really really powerful stuff, let's find our people, let's find our community, I love that. And then you know, again, you've continued to grow, you are now one of the top female agents, I don't even like to say female agents, it's almost like a little bit insulting to say female agent because of course most agents in this market or in this industry are actually women, more women than men, but you're one of just the top agents in the country, which I love, but I also love that you're one of the top female agents. I want to talk about sort of what that means to you, like how does that, what does that mean to you, by the way? Yeah, I think one of the most amazing things about real estate is you don't have to have a specific degree, like doctor or lawyer, I mean, you have certain requirements in order to hit that level and I think what is so amazing and inspiring about being in the real estate industry is, yes, the barrier to entry is low, but there's really nothing holding anybody back, you don't have to have a fancy degree, you don't have to have come from a certain socio-economic, there is opportunity for everyone and I think it's provided me an amazing life and I know that will continue, but I think the fact that there are no limits and you just have to stay positive put in the work and you can accomplish anything you want in this field and I don't think there's that many careers that are like that, you know, a lot of times you have to have 10-year or get a certain certification and in real estate there's so many ways you can be successful that can work for so many different personalities and I think that's a huge benefit of the industry and I just find it really inspiring that anybody can do what I did, I don't have a special background, I didn't come from any, you know, really wealthy family or anything like that, it was all about making opportunities and creating this career for yourself and I think for men and women that's incredible. On the women part, I have a lot of women in my family, nieces, I do have a few nephews but a lot of nieces and cousins and I just want to show them that anything is possible and it doesn't mean they have to be in real estate but I want to educate them on reaching their full potential, I think a lot of people skate by in a 9-5, they clock in, they clock out, they're semi-miserable, maybe they're lonely and why not do something that you're passionate about and take it to the next level and really make an impact whatever that career path is and so that brings me a ton of motivation and I feel like these little people are watching and I've got to show them what's possible. Yeah, I love that, that makes all the sense in the world. Let's talk about building strong partnerships because you know I want to talk about how that can actually create lead opportunities for you. So tell us about strong partnerships and how that leads to leads. Okay, I've worked with the same lender since 2009, he did my first loan or actually before I was even able to buy my house, he sat me down and gave me like a how to buy my first home and how much I needed to save and so since then we've probably exchanged 120 to 150 referrals back and forth since 2010 and so when he has an opportunity to refer out at two three four million dollar listing, he's giving out my name. When I have a client that's moving to the area that needs to get qualified, guess who I'm referring and so I think we can think of partnerships in our local community and then beyond and so I always think it makes the most sense to start building those partnerships right where you are in your market so you know every time we sell a house we put a home inspector to work, homeowners insurance, an escrow, a title, an appraiser, I mean there's all these people we touch in a transaction so why not treat them well, provide excellent service and build a relationship with every person you touch throughout the transaction because chances are in their sphere of influence, they're the expert that their friends and family are going to say hey I'm thinking about in a house to the home inspector what should I do what should I look for oh well you better call Lindsay and so starting starting in your own backyard and getting those referral sources I think is huge, the other benefit is they're a great knowledge source you know what I'm stuck I can't get homeowners insurance on this this property for my client it's going to blow up the deal okay let's call the insurance who's now my friend or at least a trusted partner and they're going to help me solve this problem but if I hadn't treated them well sent them referrals they may have bigger fish to fry and so I think if we can start on that local level and start tracking your numbers from a business I probably get 20 deals a year from vendors like just my local partners who are in the industry or some related lake of the industry and then you go a little wider like we started okay where are people that are moving to San Luis moving from I better go start talking to the top agents there and you know if you're traveling or passing through their market take them to coffee drop off a card I'm here for you any questions you have and just build that knowledge base and then all of a sudden you have 20 or 30 deals a year coming in from people you've networked networked with and all of a sudden you've got a duplicatable and repeatable business that can go year to year and continue to grow yeah I love I love everything you said I have a suggestion to add on to that so we know that when we go through a real estate transaction we touch all of these other industries all of these other a lot of times individual business owners we have attorneys, inspectors, appraisers, lenders etc and you know you as Lindsay said you want to of course do an amazing job for them and then tell them like I want to send you more business can I do that of course they'll say yes and then I would also suggest we ask each one of those hey what's the biggest challenge in your business right now just because maybe I have a solution for you and maybe you don't but the idea that knowing where someone is struggling it really is a great opportunity because it might be something you wouldn't have thought of and you might be able to help them solve that problem through a lot of different efforts and then you just keep track of that knowing that that person okay they need they need leads or they don't need leads they need somebody to help them with so maybe you have a solution because you know somebody that could help them solve a problem so I love that building those strong strategic partnerships is really such a it's such a missed opportunity you know every time we go to that closing table we should be thinking about all the people we touch it we should be having personal conversations with them saying thank you so much for being my partner on this I appreciate you and what can we how can we do more of this like what what do you need for me what could I give you and you know making it a win-win I want to talk about where we are currently and the the common sort of complaint I hear and I don't mean complaint in a negative way just the common reality that agents are struggling and frustrated with right now is well there's two obviously interest rates aren't exactly where anybody would prefer them to be when we had you know super low interest rates environments years ago but we're not there today and also inventory isn't where it was and we're just not seeing as many people you know post putting their homes per cell we have a lot of people at 3% mortgages that are perfectly happy where they are or they don't want to you know smooth so I want to talk about how do you win listings winning listings is harder than ever right now and how are you doing that in a low inventory market yeah I mean I think you have to have the mindset that no matter what someone's locked in at from an interest rate perspective there are people that have to move death divorce job transfer moving out of state I mean there are events where a lot of people are going to have to move so the first the first recommendation have as keep your mindset right someone is going to move in your market today so go find those people versus get stuck and depressed and in this negative self talk I think with all the industry changes that have happened I think sellers more than ever want an expert they want someone who is going to tell them what they need to do to sell their home that's going to communicate take things off their plate and manage the process so be the solution because a lot of people maybe aren't super excited that they have to move you know they they may be giving up their dream home because they got called back into work and they were living in paradise and and now they have to go back to an office and live in a busy town that they had sort of already mentally moved on from and so just be their support be their expert commit to doing what's right for them and then have a solution with all the commission changes and have a plan before you go in the listing when they bring up I guess I don't have to pay the buyer's agent anymore you know what Mr. Mrs. Seller you're absolutely right and let me take you through my worksheet on exactly what your options are and how other sellers in your positions are navigating this new challenge and and have the answer don't stumble through that because I have never had more conversations about commission than in the last six months because the sellers are reading the news and thinking they may not have to and they don't but I think in reality in most markets that that's not how it's actually kind of playing out and so have a solution be prepared and be confident when you are in a listing situation like that and this is a great opportunity for us to leverage AI I know we've probably heard so much about how AI can help agents and and I know we're maybe even a little sick of hearing about it but here's one way that you might not be utilizing it is have it run through these scenarios with these objections where people say hey I read this thing and apparently I don't have to pay the buyer's side anymore I'm I get to save you know two and a half percent or whatever the number might be and then you as the agent then now have to have a response to that it doesn't have to actually you know it doesn't have to be a counter but you have to number one meet them where they're at you have to explain yes I understand why you think that way and here's how it's really playing out today here's why it's playing out that way here's we'll go through the scenario here's what happens if you don't here's what happens if you do and to have the data to back that up and then practice it over and over and over again so that when somebody asks you it's like oh I have a great conversation piece around this let's talk about it let's go through the numbers let's explain to you what's actually happening what's actually changed and what it actually means to you the seller and I think I think this is chat GBT's like this is the one thing it's really really good at so you literally say it to it hey you know and now we can talk to chat GBT which is even cooler it's like you don't even have to type it out you could say I want to get better as a real estate agent with all the changes in the commission you know and you can probably by the way you can probably find if you look if you pay for chat GBT I think it's only on the paid model which is like 20 bucks a month it's really affordable you can literally search for like real estate coaches that will help real estate agents there's all they're already built like you don't even have to just like build it yourself and you could just say I want to get I want I want somebody to drill me I want somebody to raise these objections and then tell me score me tell me how am I doing on my objection objection handling does this make sense and what are other agents saying and you will you'll get the answers you don't even have to know the answers that's the best part just at ask chat GBT this is so funny we did a video this morning my my colleague recent I and we were talking about a tool on the MLS and I'm not a practicing agent so I really never use the MLS so so I might like dirty little secret as I don't practice so I don't really know the tools the REALTORS use even though I'd appears that I do because I have this popular show and we have 700 agents that are company so I'm talking about this tool that I legitimately have never used because I don't practice which makes sense but I have to talk about it and I have to be confident in how it works and thank God chat GBT told me exactly everything about it so I was able to kind of fake my way through a five minute video and that's not an ideal thing to do and if I actually had to present this to a real person then yeah I would learn it of course but but the point is is I just had to get through this video for for a training and the reality of it is is chat GBT is very helpful for the stuff so please consider using it this is what you know if you can't afford a real coach somebody that could drill you one to one then hey chat GBT it's it's 20 bucks a month and that's as cheap as an option as I've ever heard and it's not that bad it's it's a lot better than you might think okay on that one last note on how to win listing so my staff and marketing team I guess we feed chat GPT because I actually won a luxury listing last week and I was in the house with the seller and he said well this is who you're competing with and I just had chat GPT compare you and they had made like a tea chart on why they should pick me over this other very highly qualified agent in my market and chat GPT had more pros than cons for me versus this other agent but that's why it's so important to know your digital footprint because more people are going to say hey Siri call a local agent or hey Siri or you know and and all these things and that was just an example of how a seller made an important financial decision using the tools of chat GPT so feed the beast if if you can that is wild and and you know what it makes perfect sense because I do that too like I was looking for an ergonomic chair last night and obviously I could Google best ergonomic chairs which I did and then I went best ergonomic chairs read it because I trust the people on reddit a little bit more than what I might just find on a blog and then I'm like okay but I still don't know like what's the right one and I asked chat GPT and I have the paid version and it literally was like okay based on what we know about you DJ because I've been feeding an information about me and my health and all of that it said I we think this is these are the three options you should probably consider and I was like okay well it's better than I could have come up with and now I'm exploring those three options so you're absolutely right people are using it in that way I love the fact by the way that is a no cost referral to you but the cost of it is making sure like you said your digital footprint is really really intentional like you're the content you're pushing out there that chat GPT feeds from is full of really good information and full of great client reviews and all of the things that chat GPT because it's going to have to make a decision for this individual typing into the prompt who should I choose as my agent and if you have enough content out there it's not going to call your clients for you it's literally going to look through the data so ask all your clients for reviews it's more important than ever now to have them talk about their experience of working with you making sure that you're posting a lot on social as to and not just just listed just sold let's talk about the value we provide let's let's give people actual tips about how to best you know get their homes ready to sell or buy your tips or investor tips or whatever this is what social media is really good for us providing actual content and we all have a phone that can do things that you know thousands and thousands of dollars of cameras can do but you already have it in your phone you literally have it turn it around start talking to it and giving it you know put it posting that content so thank you Lindsay what a what a great great point and I love that I think you owe a come a referral check to open AI as so I love that that is so don't tell yeah yeah that's right no yeah well you and but it really is kind of funny you got a referral for free because you have such a great digital footprint I love that that's amazing now let's talk about tough client conversations because in the high net worth world and even in the you know middle or low net worth world we still have to have tough client conversations but how do you deal with tough conversations without losing the client without losing the deal you know I always try to get their buy-in from day one is can I be honest with you and so I got a call from a seller last night her home's on the market it's not with a luxury agent and she's like there's been it's been on the market for 78 days and I we've only had four showings and they weren't qualified and I am and I go can okay I'm going to go look at your house today after this call can I be brutally honest with you yet I've already looked at your photos that front photo it's not doing anything for me I have no idea what I'm looking at if I wear a buyer I would have no clue and make no request to see your home okay and and you have you have to have the tough conversations from day one because if you're and I'm not saying dishonest but if you're overly if you try to overly bond it in the beginning now this is your friend you're not the expert it's really hard then to say okay now we're not friends today I'm wearing my mean hat my expert hat and now I'm going to have to tell you your house is overpriced your dog bed smell and you've got to get a deep cleaned and wash your windows but now you've lost 75 days and now you're losing your credibility with that client and so I always try to stay super super professional and if we build a friendship or relationship it's always after the transactions over because they're calling you because they need an expert they don't want to test the market they want their home sold they're they've bought another home there is a deadline that they do not want to be paying two mortgages in this interest rate environment so so just get their permission from day one and speak with authority and then when you say it it's not personal it's I am the expert and this is what the data and the market is telling us and here is my recommendation talk to your husband talk to your wife let's regroup in the next 48 hours once you've had to process this and and just get their permission to be honest and and have confidence I love that there's a great expression with friends that I always thought was a good thing to remember is I like you enough to tell you the truth like it's actually the most respectful thing you can do is to tell somebody the truth that they can't see and it's not easy and it's not always fun and like you said you ask permission because that's the right thing to do before you're about to tell somebody something that likely they don't want to hear and you know some people respond well to it some people don't but you're getting there by and say hey I've got some news to deliver that's really important may I deliver that news to you yes you may okay here's the here's the truth is X you know you're that first picture is driving people away it's not a good picture people people are so short attention span that they see that first picture and they just go well I guess this place sucks people shouldn't be that way it stinks that they are but they are so we're gonna get that fixed for you we're gonna do X Y and Z I love that and people appreciate honesty it even when it's hard and the people that don't appreciate it you really don't probably want them as a client anyway because they're not gonna listen to you and the home's gonna stay on the market for another 75 days because they don't see the reality and you've told them the reality I love that though but I love the fact that you ask permission first because you do need permission to tell people the hard truth and once they give you that permission I'll bet you 95% of the time they're open to making those changes because they go wow she respects me enough to tell me something that I don't want to hear I mean people when they reflect back on that they respect that about agents I think well and you're looking out for their best interest and I would say no if you were my brother my aunt my uncle my cousin this is what I would say and do so I'm gonna treat you on that same level and if you only take 90% of my input and not 100 that's fine but this is the exact same advice I would give my best friend and that you know I want you to know I have that best interest in mind and I think that goes a long way and yeah they appreciate it in the long run you know it's so funny we talk about these things as if they're just so easy to do these you're not easy things to do people we we get it we know it is not easy to tell somebody their beloved home is not as beloved to you as it might be to them and to the public and there's a problem here or that it's over price in fact I want to talk about that let's talk about pricing the home correctly which is probably the most challenging thing I think a REALTOR can do with a listing because even even myself as somebody who is kind of in the industry and certainly aware of the pitfalls that list that owners have about over you know over valuing their property I went I had the same same exact experience maybe like 10 years ago when I was selling a condo I knew that people like myself would think it's worth more than it is and I still priced it higher than I should have and I had to have a you know a very honest conversation with myself very quickly like oh yeah okay that's not working that's not a good idea so let's talk about pricing the home properly what is your strategy to do that yeah I mean I I think a lot of times right now at least in California like I'm meeting with people in February or January and we're putting their house on the market in April and so at that listing appointment we talk about price and I say look I don't have a crystal ball our first impression is key our first impression is the photos the video the marketing materials and the price and so right now we're penciling in a price of X and we're signing this contract but one week before we hit the market we are going to sit back down run a new CMA and we are going to fine tune it because it does make all the difference does you know and get their buy in on that I go in a perfect world the market will be the same or slightly better I can't control what's going to happen in the future so we need to to readjust and be willing to to do that I think there's also in the Superhion sometimes we'll test it we'll have it as a pocket listing show a couple buyers we know who are looking and get their objections and their feedback before we're publicly listed on the MLS and that way I can go to the seller look this one or two things are going keep coming up as objections so we need to fix it find a solution or or price it into our final price and I think people like in the Superhion to sort of know about something a little bit early to to have this exclusivity and so I think that's a win for the potential buyers the potential sellers and for the listing agent and if you don't have buyers in the price range maybe you grab your office mates and you say look I'd like your unbiased opinion get back to me I will give you early access to see this incredible property I'm just going to ask you spend five minutes privately after the viewing and get back to me with what the list price should be and what you think it'll actually sell for an exchange you're providing them something of value that the rest of the market doesn't have early access to and so that is a great tip what a great idea especially the low inventory environment I love nobody nobody has ever shared that tip in our 600 and whatever episodes we've done over seven years that is an amazing tip so I just want to reiterate what what Lindsey just said because that was brilliant so what she said is hey I want to make sure my pricing is accurate here you say this to other agents and you say as a thank you to you for coming to check out the property you know you'll have sort of first look at it and but I really need your input I need you to think about you put your buyer hat on take a look tell me what you think this home is actually worth what you think it's going to sell for because one of you guys is going to probably bring a briar for it anyway and I want to make sure that I'm you know I'm not missing something so boy that is brilliant oh boy I love that you really do take a lot of advice you you take advice from your peers you take advice from clients I just love that you you're very very wise I think it's very smart to do that so wow well I want to finish with one thing which is lots of people want to become top producers and of course who doesn't want to be a top producer but let's talk about what's the reality of a top producer so give us the reality of of of being a top agent well I think a lot of people think I'm going to get into real estate is sort of this part time flexible career I can you know raise a family I can maybe have another job and I'm just going to sort of do that for for fun or for hobby or to supplement my income I think the hard part with that is once you actually gain traction and start getting clients particularly in a low inventory market it's 24-7 buyers have their own alert set on Zillow Redfin their website a choice you have to constantly prove to your clients that you're providing more value than the internet their cell phone chat GPT that they have access to already so that requires a full time and a half I always say I have I work full time and a half about 60-70 hours a week because if you're going to be a top producer you have to generate business every day you have to maintain client relationships every day you have to work through challenges on escrow's problems that come up you have to be networking with other agents you have to be in charge of marketing advertising and doing it all again the next day and so if you want to be setting boundaries like you can call or text me between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m. and otherwise I will return your call the next business day real estate is a 24-7 business I've done deals on Easter I've done deals on Christmas Eve they're when the right property and the right opportunity comes up in a low inventory market you've got to be able to pounce and so it's it's key to set your schedule and your expectations that if you are going to be a top producer there will be late nights there will be early mornings the payoff in the end for a lot of people will be worth it but it's certainly not for everybody yeah it's a sacrifice all of it's a sacrifice and you don't get the perfectly balanced home and work and social life it's just first of all I don't know that perfectly balances even a real thing so the quest for that I think is is a bit erroneous in nature but if you want to be a top producer you are going to work a lot of hours it's just the unfortunately the way of the way of the the the dragon right it's just how it goes but the rewards are really great so you get to have great rewards but at great sacrifice but at the same time you know you have established a balance for yourself you you can tell you are a seemingly sort of peaceful person you seem relatively accepting of kind of what the reality is you're you're not I was speaking to you before we started and you know you didn't seem stressed about inventory or interest rates you just you have a plan you're like I'm just working my plan I'm doing the thing I always do which is work really really hard and maybe I'll work the next agent a little bit and just have fun along the way too which is really part of it and just you know decide to keep going so I love that I think that is really good advice you know there's there's this great story I can't remember the name of there was a famous violinist and at a party in New York City like 30 years ago somebody came up to them at a cocktail party and they knew who that person was and said oh my gosh I wish I could play the violin like you and he said no you don't because you didn't because if you did you would know that it's so much work that you trust me you wouldn't want to do it if you wanted to do it you would do it he's like this is this is what I do this is my entire life and it didn't he didn't mean it to say that he has a bad life he has a great life he's a this world renowned violinist but it becomes an obsession it becomes their life and you know the willingness to put in that kind of work is what the good news is for people that are willing to put in the work it's not that crowded there's not that many people really doing that of course there's always people coming up behind you but that's great for you know competition and all of that so I appreciate that and by the way it's okay to not to want to be a top producer too if you want more balance in your life maybe top producer isn't the thing and maybe that's a good idea that's certainly not for everybody but if you do want to go down that path you have to recognize and just you know what I always say is go hang out with the top producer for a week see what their schedule is like it will floor you it will absolutely floor you and you'll and then you'll see why enjoy this kind of schedule is this for me if it isn't then that's not for you but what's really cool is when you know and I find this I've almost found this exclusively with top agents they seem to really love it there's something about it that something about real estate that it seems to be worth all the hard work for a top agents like I don't I really don't talk to top agents who are miserable maybe they just don't be on my show or I find them I really don't do that I know there's other professions I've talked to really successful attorneys that are miserable I've talked to successful doctors that are miserable I don't know what it is about real estate but there's something about it I know it's not less work so I know there's something about it that people who are attracted to becoming a high producer seem to really like it so and what what a blessing that is like to actually like the thing that you're doing all the time you know I don't think if if I was a doctor I wouldn't be a very good one number one but number two I don't think I'd want to see a patient every 15 minutes and most doctors that's how it works and that's a tough grind for 50 years so you know we think about oh well you know these these professions they're just they have so much reward it's like well yeah but there's a lot of work involved but I think real estate like you were saying earlier it's very merit-based it's it's very much it's kind of like sports in a way in a way and I don't want to totally compare it to sports but I think there is a connection there when we look at athletes and we think well you just have to be the best and if you're the best it doesn't matter what you look like as long as you're the best you could probably make it in a professional you know sports league and the same thing here in real estate as long as you have a good plan and you execute it and you get feedback and you keep trying you're probably going to do okay so I think that's there's something very magical about this industry and not every industry is like that like you could be the best you know any other industry sort of you know person and not reap a lot of rewards so I think real estate is very merit sort of focused and anyway you've given me you've given me some things to think about for myself so Lindsay I appreciate you you are doing doing it and I know as soon
