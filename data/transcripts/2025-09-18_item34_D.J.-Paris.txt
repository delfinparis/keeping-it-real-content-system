[00:01:14] And now, onto our show.
[00:01:16] Today's episode is brought to you by corded.io.
[00:01:20] Are you looking for agents to join your brokerage or team?
[00:01:23] Now, as a real estate recruiter, I can tell you the answer is always yes.
[00:01:28] But most agents aren't looking to move right now.
[00:01:31] So how do you know who to contact?
[00:01:33] Well, what if I were to tell you there's a recruiting and retention tool powered by
[00:01:36] artificial intelligence that shows you exactly which agents in your local market are looking
[00:01:42] to leave their brokerage right now and which agents at your own firm are also looking
[00:01:47] to leave you?
[00:01:49] Now, I've been recruiting REALTORS for 15 years and I've hired over 2,000 agents.
[00:01:53] I can tell you with no exaggeration, this is the tool I've been waiting for.
[00:01:58] Corded's AI looks for trends across dozens of variables for each agent in your market
[00:02:03] and shows you which agents they believe are likely to move.
[00:02:06] Not only does it do that, but corded's AI went and visited my recruiting website and
[00:02:11] read everything I offer.
[00:02:12] So now when I'm recruiting, corded's AI tells me exactly what to say based on that
[00:02:18] agent's needs and what my brokerage can offer.
[00:02:21] It even writes emails for me.
[00:02:23] I've never seen anything like it and I use it every single day.
[00:02:27] Now, if you are looking to grow your brokerage, corded.io is the best tool out there.
[00:02:32] Visit corded.io to schedule a demo again.
[00:02:35] That's corded.io.
[00:02:37] And now, onto the show.
[00:02:52] Hello and welcome to another episode of Keeping It Real, the largest podcast made by real estate
[00:02:57] agents and four real estate agents.
[00:02:59] My name is DJ Paris.
[00:03:01] I'm your guide and host through the show.
[00:03:03] Today, I'm the guest.
[00:03:04] Well, I'm not actually the guest, but what I am going to share with you is a webinar or
[00:03:10] rather a seminar that I did for the Women's Council of REALTORS here in the Chicago
[00:03:15] Land area, specifically talking about how top 1% agents utilize chat GPT and specifically
[00:03:22] how they craft their queries.
[00:03:24] So we may be using chat GPT to write or ask for things like help with our listing presentation
[00:03:31] or maybe some social media post ideas, but there are ways you can super charge those questions.
[00:03:37] And I provide the framework for exactly how to do that in a five step process.
[00:03:42] It's super easy to understand, but you may have not heard this before.
[00:03:47] So this is the best way to think about how do I interact with chat GPT and I promise
[00:03:52] by listening to this, you're going to get great results going forward with your AI searches.
[00:03:57] Now, just as a point to mention, there's going to be a few times during this presentation
[00:04:03] where somebody from the audience will ask a question.
[00:04:05] You might not hear the question.
[00:04:07] I apologize for that.
[00:04:08] I will be giving the answer.
[00:04:09] So you'll probably be able to tell what that is, but the vast majority of the time I am
[00:04:13] presenting without any questions.
[00:04:15] And there's a PDF to go along with this that is a companion piece, which will be in the
[00:04:20] show notes.
[00:04:20] So please check that out as well.
[00:04:22] You can download that and use it.
[00:04:24] But just what I want you to do is really just listen to sort of understand the framework.
[00:04:29] And from here, I promise you'll get so much value out of it.
[00:04:32] It's so grateful for the women's council of REALTORS to having me.
[00:04:35] And this was a lot of fun for me.
[00:04:36] And I'll probably do more of these into the future.
[00:04:38] By the way, I do a series, a video series short form video about three times a week on all
[00:04:45] of the social channels for keeping it real.
[00:04:46] So anywhere you can find us, YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, TikTok, and probably
[00:04:51] other places where I show 60 second clips of exactly some queries that top agents are using.
[00:04:58] I give you the query.
[00:04:59] I explain why it's effective.
[00:05:00] And then you can go out and use it today.
[00:05:02] So if you're not already following me on the different social channels or on YouTube,
[00:05:06] please do so so you can get those 60 second tips.
[00:05:08] We do not post those here.
[00:05:09] So they're only on social channels and on YouTube.
[00:05:13] So please check that out.
[00:05:14] I would appreciate it and give me your feedback.
[00:05:16] Let me know what queries you would like me to craft for you.
[00:05:19] And I'll give those to you.
[00:05:20] And I love making those videos.
[00:05:21] So anyway, all right, big and true.
[00:05:23] I appreciate that.
[00:05:24] Thank you to all the new listeners, all the returning listeners.
[00:05:26] Thank you to our sponsors.
[00:05:27] And let's get to it.
[00:05:28] My conversation, well with me, about AI and how top agents are using it.
[00:05:50] Thank you.
[00:05:51] I don't want to follow that.
[00:05:52] That was really, really great.
[00:05:54] So I have a big shoes to follow.
[00:05:56] So thank you, Jennifer.
[00:05:58] Thank you, Hartland for having me come out.
[00:06:00] Thank you, Women's Council of REALTORS.
[00:06:01] I'm a huge fan of WCR.
[00:06:04] I'm a member of the Chicago chapter.
[00:06:06] And a cement aren't smart enough to have our own group.
[00:06:09] But you women are very smart to do this because I think we all need support and help.
[00:06:15] And WCR is if nothing else is support organization for their members.
[00:06:19] And obviously they do a lot of good in the community too.
[00:06:22] But boy, what a great thing.
[00:06:24] I've had definitely, I believe, I'd have to look.
[00:06:26] But I think I've had some national WCR people on my show if I haven't.
[00:06:31] I need to.
[00:06:31] I've certainly reached out to them.
[00:06:33] So if anyone does have connections with their national people, let me know.
[00:06:37] And I'll get them on.
[00:06:38] And so yeah, a little bit about me.
[00:06:40] I am a, well, I podcast as more of a hobby.
[00:06:43] It's a fun thing I do.
[00:06:44] I have a day job, which I'll be doing right after this, where I work for the company called
[00:06:49] Kale Realty, where brokerage in the city.
[00:06:51] We have about 700 agents.
[00:06:52] I've been there for gosh, 14 years when back when we just had a couple of agents.
[00:06:57] So it's been fun to grow that business and half our brokers live in the suburbs.
[00:07:01] So this is not a foreign to me to be, although I don't get to go out to the suburbs.
[00:07:05] I live in the city.
[00:07:05] So I'm not out here very much.
[00:07:07] But I'm grateful to be here and excited to speak with everyone today.
[00:07:11] Also have the podcast.
[00:07:12] So, oh, and what do I do at Kale?
[00:07:14] I'm an agent, but I don't practice.
[00:07:16] So don't ask me real estate questions because I'll be the, you'll know more than me.
[00:07:20] But, which is funny because I have this podcast, which is fairly popular for real estate agents.
[00:07:25] And, you know, again, people ask me questions and I just try to say, oh, you know, I ask,
[00:07:30] I ask the experts, but I do have access to a lot of experts.
[00:07:33] So that's what we'll talk about a little bit today is what are the top agents doing in AI.
[00:07:37] But what do I do during the day is I recruit agents.
[00:07:40] I don't worry.
[00:07:40] I'm not going to try to recruit anyone here, but that's what I do all day.
[00:07:43] So I sit at a desk and I do support also for our 700 agents.
[00:07:47] So I hear a lot about the questions and challenges REALTORS have as well as talking to top agents all over the country.
[00:07:54] So I've done about 700 episodes.
[00:07:56] My podcast is also, it's called Keeping It Real.
[00:08:00] I wish I would have renamed it because there's about five other podcasts also called Keeping It Real.
[00:08:04] So that was, you know, maybe a tactical error seven years ago.
[00:08:08] But we have over, yeah, 700 episodes or so, I think.
[00:08:12] And we put out a few episodes a week.
[00:08:13] I talked to the top agents in the country and just say, how'd you do that?
[00:08:16] How'd you grow your business?
[00:08:17] I thought it was just a smart thing to do because back when we, when I started, we didn't have much training at our firm.
[00:08:23] We have, we have that now.
[00:08:24] But back then we didn't.
[00:08:25] I thought, well, if I collected the stories from the top agents, that'd probably be pretty good for our agents.
[00:08:30] And then I just thought, I'll just, you know, put it out there for everyone.
[00:08:32] And so it's been a lot of fun.
[00:08:34] And I really appreciate anyone who's a listener and check it out, see if you like it.
[00:08:38] And if you do tell someone else about it, that would also help.
[00:08:41] But we have sponsors and it's really fun.
[00:08:43] I have a whole team that works on it now and it's just really fun to do.
[00:08:45] So my boss is nice enough to let me do it.
[00:08:48] So that is, that is why I'm here today is really too.
[00:08:52] We, we actually, at our firm, we've tried to, we just launched an AI chatbot for our agents because we want to cut down to the support questions.
[00:09:00] Not that we don't love supporting our agents.
[00:09:02] We have a lot of them and we don't have, you know, we only have seven of us in our support team.
[00:09:06] So we have to make sure that, you know, we have access to information when we're sleeping and we're not around, you know, pick up the phone and answer those calls.
[00:09:13] So we created a little AI chatbot of our own.
[00:09:16] So we're really AI forward at our, at our company.
[00:09:18] It's really fun.
[00:09:19] It's really hard to develop an AI chat.
[00:09:21] That's knows everything our support team knows.
[00:09:23] So we're actually learning this along the way too.
[00:09:26] But this is going to be coming.
[00:09:27] If your brokerage doesn't have that, it will, you know, everyone's going to have an AI chatbot.
[00:09:31] You probably already are using chat, GPT or Google Gemini or GROC or Clawed or any of those other AI systems.
[00:09:38] So if you haven't, don't worry.
[00:09:40] We're going to get you through it.
[00:09:41] But what I really want to talk about today is just how to utilize chat GPT.
[00:09:46] And I'm going to give you all sorts of suggestions about how you could use it in your business.
[00:09:50] And I can give you prompts.
[00:09:50] I have prompts in this PDF.
[00:09:52] This PDF, by the way, will be emailed to you, excited to Jennifer.
[00:09:56] She can distribute it.
[00:09:57] I'm recording this as well.
[00:09:58] So don't worry if you miss anything.
[00:09:59] We'll have the recording.
[00:10:00] You guys can download it.
[00:10:01] I'll probably make, make it even a podcast episode.
[00:10:04] So you can all be part of my podcast audience.
[00:10:05] I appreciate that.
[00:10:07] And don't worry though, you're not in camera.
[00:10:08] It's just me.
[00:10:08] And then you'll be able to watch this back.
[00:10:12] So don't worry if you miss something.
[00:10:13] What I really want to impart today, and this is part of our journey when we were building
[00:10:17] our chatbot, which took us months at our firm.
[00:10:20] I mean, you think it'd be pretty simple.
[00:10:21] We have a website that's for our agents.
[00:10:24] And it has hundreds of questions and support stuff because we were smart enough to do that
[00:10:27] like 10 years ago.
[00:10:28] And then we thought, OK, well, we're just going to have it read everything.
[00:10:30] And then we'll just know what to say.
[00:10:32] We found that, oh, it's a lot more than that.
[00:10:34] And so when we were building ours, again, we just thought it'd be so easy.
[00:10:37] And it wasn't.
[00:10:37] And we had to learn how to teach the AI what we wanted it to tell our agents.
[00:10:43] And so I'm going to sort of teach to you some of the learnings we have taken over that
[00:10:47] time.
[00:10:47] And also I talked to top agents all over the country, and I asked them, how do you use AI?
[00:10:53] So that's all we're going to do.
[00:10:54] I really, my intention today is really to teach you how to communicate with AI.
[00:10:59] Not to necessarily say these are the best prompts.
[00:11:01] I give you a bunch of examples of good prompts, I think.
[00:11:04] But you're going to be able to craft your own when we're done with here.
[00:11:06] Because if is everyone not ever, I shouldn't say it, how many people have utilized like chat
[00:11:12] CBT or one of the, OK, seems like most everyone.
[00:11:15] OK, if you haven't, don't worry.
[00:11:16] Super easy.
[00:11:17] It's free, by the way.
[00:11:18] Although I do recommend pay for the premium version.
[00:11:22] It's like, what is it?
[00:11:22] 20 bucks a month?
[00:11:23] 20, like it's the best 20 bucks you'll ever spend.
[00:11:26] Like it is way better.
[00:11:27] Like cancel your HBO max, which is like, I think I pay 25 a month for that.
[00:11:31] I love that.
[00:11:32] But this is this is going to help you more.
[00:11:33] So, you know, if you're strapped for cash, beg borrower steel, get that $20 because it will
[00:11:38] really, really help you.
[00:11:40] But the free version is good too.
[00:11:41] But the nice part about the paid version is it can just do more things.
[00:11:44] It can remember things and you really want it to really get a sense of who you are along
[00:11:48] the way and it figures that out too.
[00:11:50] So anyway, that's my little pitch for chat CBT.
[00:11:52] But, you know, you can use other ones.
[00:11:54] Jim Gemini is good.
[00:11:54] They're all really good.
[00:11:55] It's just pick one you like.
[00:11:57] So I'm going to talk specifically about how I use chat CBT because that's the one I use.
[00:12:00] But they all pretty much work very similarly.
[00:12:02] And what I want to really share with you is how to best approach getting a good result.
[00:12:07] Because, you know, I used to just type in things like, you know, I would think about,
[00:12:12] okay, what's a good prompt for an agent?
[00:12:14] And I would think, okay, give me 10 social media post ideas, right?
[00:12:18] Which, you know, seem like a decent idea.
[00:12:20] You know, and I would say, oh, you know, I'm a REALTOR.
[00:12:22] Give me 10 social media post ideas for content.
[00:12:25] Or maybe you throw a listing in a listing description, right?
[00:12:28] And say, rewrite this.
[00:12:29] Write this in a better way.
[00:12:31] We probably all tried some version of that.
[00:12:33] And we get varying results, right?
[00:12:35] Sometimes it's a wonderful, like exactly what I'm looking for.
[00:12:38] And other times it's like, you know, it's more general.
[00:12:42] I know I used to be frustrated when we, remember pre AI, we would go online and look for like,
[00:12:47] what's, you know, what are 10 good marketing ideas as a REALTOR I should do today?
[00:12:51] And you'd find these lists of top 10 things to do.
[00:12:53] And mostly they're really generic.
[00:12:55] And most list if you guys noticed that, you know, the website lists are not typically that great.
[00:13:00] And so I wanted to sort of get past that with, because AI is trained on stuff like that.
[00:13:05] So you have to actually really teach it exactly what you're looking for.
[00:13:09] And the good news is it's pretty easy.
[00:13:10] Once you sort of think the framework, once you understand the framework and sort of just think it through a little bit,
[00:13:15] it'll make your results much, much better.
[00:13:18] And, you know, I'm going to show you how to, how I do that and how I recommend doing that.
[00:13:22] And then I, I threw in my ideas into chat GVT and said, are these accurate, right?
[00:13:26] Because I wanted to make sure that chat GVT agree that these are great ways to get better results.
[00:13:31] So I'm even using chat GVT to help with this presentation.
[00:13:35] So let's get started.
[00:13:37] I'm going to get you this PDF.
[00:13:38] So don't worry about, if you can't see it, I'm just going to be talking through it.
[00:13:41] There's, you know, it's really not that much to look at at the moment.
[00:13:44] But I'll certainly give you the, the gist of it.
[00:13:46] And I really, I think we should start with, how do you best think about approaching AI?
[00:13:52] Think of it as the, sorry, the way I think of it, I'm not going to tell you how to think about it.
[00:13:56] But the way I think about it is more of a consultant.
[00:13:59] Has anyone ever worked in consultancy or has anyone have the consultant in their family?
[00:14:04] If you have, you typically know what they do, which is, it's always a little,
[00:14:09] you know, I never quite understand what a consultant really does.
[00:14:11] But I understand the process, which is they go into a business or they, you know,
[00:14:15] they have a client who has a problem.
[00:14:17] And then they go in and say, all right, or I'll give you a better example.
[00:14:20] You go to the doctor, right?
[00:14:21] You have some sort of reason you're going to see the doctor.
[00:14:23] And before you just go, I got this problem and I need a solution.
[00:14:26] They're like, whoa, whoa, whoa, fill out these 200 questions about your, you know, your health
[00:14:30] history because it's really important that we know exactly what your health has been over the
[00:14:34] last, you know, your entire life.
[00:14:36] And we need to know what happened with your family and all that stuff, because that might influence
[00:14:40] might as what I, you know, recommend as a solution for your health issue, right?
[00:14:44] Consultants do the same thing.
[00:14:45] So, so we're going to sort of think of it as AI is not just a search engine.
[00:14:50] And, and it's way more than that.
[00:14:52] And if you can get really dialed in to exactly what you need.
[00:14:57] And if you think about who should be answering the question,
[00:15:00] not letting chat GPT just decide, here's how I think it should answer the question for my query,
[00:15:05] my question is I'm going to tell it exactly the type of person that would be best suited
[00:15:11] to answer this question.
[00:15:13] So, I'll say that again.
[00:15:15] So, if I was, if I had a, you know, injury with my brain, right, I wouldn't go to a general
[00:15:20] practitioner. I'd be like, I better go to a neurologist or I better go to a neurosurgeon or
[00:15:23] I better find out who's the specialist who handles, you know, my particular brain issue, right?
[00:15:29] So, we're going to think about it as chat GPT and its essence is just a general practitioner,
[00:15:33] which is great.
[00:15:34] You can give you all sorts of good ideas.
[00:15:36] But if you really want dialed in ideas, you want it going to want to go to a little bit of a higher
[00:15:40] level in specialty, which means you got to tell it that.
[00:15:43] And over time, if you have the paid version, it'll sort of learn kind of who you are and what you
[00:15:47] need. So, you don't always have to do this, but you'll have to do it initially, right?
[00:15:51] So, let's think about what, let's, hey, let's actually make this really interactive.
[00:15:56] So, let's just think about right now, just think of what's the,
[00:15:59] doesn't have to be the biggest challenge because biggest challenge might be hard to figure out.
[00:16:02] But what's one challenge that any of you are experiencing right now in your business,
[00:16:06] just yell out one challenge?
[00:16:11] Oh, you have challenges. I promise.
[00:16:14] What does that mean?
[00:16:18] So, listings are staying on the market for longer.
[00:16:22] Yes, that's a national thing, by the way, if you guys haven't been reading about that.
[00:16:26] So, problem.
[00:16:28] Listings are staying on the market for longer.
[00:16:31] What does that basically mean, by the way?
[00:16:34] Rises are too high, right?
[00:16:36] That's the answer.
[00:16:37] Now, that doesn't mean it's an easy answer and it doesn't mean, okay, well, my clients are just
[00:16:41] going to have to deal with that because obviously they might have to or they might not,
[00:16:45] that's your decision.
[00:16:46] But that's what it means, essentially, right?
[00:16:49] Okay, so, that's the problem.
[00:16:51] The problem is my listings aren't selling.
[00:16:54] I'm not getting action on my listings.
[00:16:56] Is that what I'm hearing?
[00:16:56] Is that accurate?
[00:16:58] Fair enough.
[00:16:58] Okay, is there a lot of people experiencing this?
[00:17:01] Yes, okay.
[00:17:02] So, how might we think about chat GBT to solve this problem?
[00:17:08] Now, by the way, it might not be able to solve this problem.
[00:17:10] But we're going to give it a shot.
[00:17:12] I'm not going to feed in.
[00:17:13] I'm not going to get a result from this.
[00:17:15] I'm just going to teach you how to think about getting a result.
[00:17:17] So, if we were to think who would know of what type of expert or what type of individual
[00:17:23] would be really a great resource if you had them in your office and you had somebody who was like,
[00:17:30] oh, that's not a problem for me.
[00:17:32] What would be that kind of person's characteristics?
[00:17:36] So, let's think about that.
[00:17:37] Who would know how to solve that problem?
[00:17:40] It's a tough question.
[00:17:42] But let's think about it.
[00:17:43] Maybe top producer,
[00:17:45] somebody who's maybe going to MRED and look for who's beating the market time,
[00:17:51] who's selling things within seven days as opposed to 20 days.
[00:17:55] 
[00:17:55] Maybe somebody like that.
[00:17:57] So, we would want to look for an agent who is producing and selling homes
[00:18:03] is more quickly than what the market is currently averaging.
[00:18:08] Does that make sense?
[00:18:10] Now, we don't know who that person is and we don't know what skills they have,
[00:18:13] but we know that they can do that.
[00:18:15] That's all we need to know.
[00:18:17] So, the first step is for us to define the role of who's going to solve this problem.
[00:18:22] Now, again, this sounds sort of like, okay, I guess, but this is how it works.
[00:18:27] So, you have to think about who's the person that can best solve this problem.
[00:18:30] I'll give you an example.
[00:18:31] I was coming into Crystal Lake last night.
[00:18:33] I'm not familiar with Crystal Lake.
[00:18:35] I mean, I know about it, but I don't know like, I was hungry and I needed to eat something and I'm like,
[00:18:39] I don't know what the good restaurants are out here.
[00:18:41] So, at first, I just thought best restaurants in Crystal Lake, and that's all I typed in.
[00:18:46] And it gave me a bunch of ideas.
[00:18:47] And I thought, well, best, according to who, like, who's determining what's best?
[00:18:51] Like, people have different tastes, people have different budgets, people have different.
[00:18:54] Some people, you know, eat fancy, other people eat more, you know, casual, like, everyone's different.
[00:18:59] It doesn't know what I want.
[00:19:01] And then I thought, well, I guess I could tell it what I want,
[00:19:03] but like, I don't really care.
[00:19:04] It could be fancy or it could be inexpensive.
[00:19:06] I just want good.
[00:19:07] And I thought, okay, well, who would know what the best restaurants are?
[00:19:10] Or at least, who might know?
[00:19:12] You know, and I thought, well, a food critic would probably know, right?
[00:19:15] If I trusted that, the food critic was good, but I, you know, I figured that was a good idea.
[00:19:19] So, I typed in, imagine your food critic, expert food critic, and you write a column
[00:19:24] for the, you know, your paper and your, or on TV.
[00:19:28] What would you recommend as the three best restaurants to eat that are open right now,
[00:19:32] because I was coming in late, and it gave me three ideas.
[00:19:35] I won't say what they are, because I don't, I don't have any stake in this, it doesn't matter.
[00:19:39] But that, that actually gave me different response results.
[00:19:42] And then it even explained to me why as a food critic, it would recommend, and these were not,
[00:19:48] I thought they'd give me like the fanciest places, and I was like, I don't really want to do that,
[00:19:51] but it didn't. It gave me like, really approachable places.
[00:19:54] And I could have refined it further, and I said, well, I really want to eat more upscale,
[00:19:57] or I want to, I want to have more casual experience.
[00:19:59] I could have done that, but it just gave me three relief, like, simple good ideas.
[00:20:02] I was like, okay, cool.
[00:20:02] And that's what I selected for.
[00:20:04] So really, really easy, right? So we want to think about who can best solve this problem.
[00:20:08] Now, the problem is real.
[00:20:10] Homes aren't selling as quickly. We're dealing with this in the city.
[00:20:13] The suburbs are certainly dealing with it.
[00:20:15] Nationwide, I think the average time on market is now up to, oh gosh, does anyone know,
[00:20:20] is it 40 days? It used to be 26.
[00:20:23] So this is not a problem that is unique to hear, and it is a problem.
[00:20:27] Yeah, yeah, yeah. So it's all, you know, and again, I might have those numbers wrong, but,
[00:20:32] but the point is, is that this is a problem, and your clients are going to be upset
[00:20:37] if they're not getting action on their property, and you have promised them that you will get
[00:20:41] them action, right? Or if you've suggested they will, because you're going to have to have a
[00:20:44] pretty hard conversation with them about pricing, or taking it off the market, maybe, right?
[00:20:49] So, or, or, or, or making improvements, or whatever, whatever the solution is.
[00:20:53] So the first step is in this problem to think, okay, who could best solve it, right?
[00:20:59] Who's the role of the person that could best solve it?
[00:21:01] And if I, the more specific I could get, so for, I would write something like,
[00:21:07] acting as a top 1% listing agent who is able to have their proper, their listing sold, you know,
[00:21:16] 50% quicker than the average REALTOR in my area in Crystal Lake, right? I would even, or whatever
[00:21:21] area you might be, you know, this listing might be in. I would even get that specific, because it
[00:21:25] can even start to look at that data. I was thinking of moving out to Oak Park recently.
[00:21:29] First thing I did, I thought I should probably learn like what the market is really like in Oak Park,
[00:21:34] and I could study MRED, but I don't, I, I want to talk to an expert. So I said, give me the
[00:21:40] agents who have sold the most homes in Oak Park in the last year, and you know, I could do that on
[00:21:45] MRED too, but Chatshipiti did faster. Then I called those, those Oak Park agents and I said,
[00:21:50] hey, I'm not going to use you because I'm an agent, but like, I would really love if you had
[00:21:54] any tips for me. And by the way, aren't REALTOR so generous with information? Like, they had
[00:21:59] no real reason to help me, although, you know, they have listings and maybe, you know, they'd
[00:22:03] consider me for a listing to tell me about it maybe before it's the market. I don't know, but they
[00:22:08] were just like, oh, you need to do this, this, and this. So like, I'm, I did a version of this in
[00:22:12] real life. I just asked those three people, and they had no reason to want to help me. And technically,
[00:22:18] I'm competition, but, you know, people are pretty nice, right? So we want to think about that,
[00:22:22] who could best solve this problem, or what type of person could solve this problem, and what
[00:22:27] characteristics would they have? So I would start there. So now, is this going to give you a magic
[00:22:31] bullet answer? Like, oh, you just have to do this one thing, probably not, but it'll give you a better
[00:22:36] better probability of giving a good answer. Does this make sense? Yes. Okay. Let's do one more,
[00:22:41] just to have fun. Think of one other issue that somebody is having that is, you know, making your
[00:22:48] life just a little bit more difficult right now. Oh, well, we have a guaranteed rate person here.
[00:22:56] So, uh, so he gets that question all day long. Uh, by the way, rates are to 10 all year low,
[00:23:04] right? So like, but people are still like, they're not 3% and everyone who has a 3% rate is,
[00:23:10] why would I sell? Right? Like, I'm a get, I have to sell it to three. I have to give up my 3%
[00:23:14] rate here. Certainly, I'm not happy about it, but oh, well, such as life. Um, and so I get it.
[00:23:19] That's a real problem, right? It was like 85% of the country has less than like a 4% or I,
[00:23:23] guaranteed rate, a gentleman can, can give you the stats on that, but like, it's tough. Like,
[00:23:28] getting people to want to move. That's a rough one. Uh, I have to. So, uh, you know, for a life
[00:23:33] event. So it makes sense for me, but certainly not something I'm happy about, but that's a problem.
[00:23:37] So that's a great one. So I would say acting as a, I might start with a top loan consultant,
[00:23:45] a low, an originator, a mortgage lender. I might start there and say, what would a lender,
[00:23:50] what would a top lender say is a reason to consider selling your property if you're looking for
[00:23:56] listing, uh, even though you might have a 3% mortgage, right? And, and by the way, are there
[00:24:02] reasons to consider giving up, even if you don't have to move, is there, are there any good arguments
[00:24:06] to be made to give up your property at a 3% current rate for a 6 or 7% rate? There are. Right?
[00:24:14] Maybe they're not compelling to the person you'll be sharing that way. There maybe they won't
[00:24:18] want to do it, but is there an answer to that? There is. Um, and it makes sense and I, it makes
[00:24:22] sense in my situation. Number one, I don't want to compete with everybody when the rates come down,
[00:24:26] because what's that going to do to pricing? It's going to shoot it up and, and, and our, our
[00:24:31] friend at guaranteed rate will tell you, you date the rate, you marry the home, right? So,
[00:24:34] you know, you get, yeah, it sucks and nobody wants to pay, uh, let borrow money at twice the
[00:24:40] expense it was, you know, years ago, but oh well. So I'd rather not compete with all these buyers,
[00:24:46] personally, but is that a hard psychological barrier to get over? Sure. That's a tough one.
[00:24:51] So again, I might throw into chat GBT. What might I say? If I were a lending top loan officer who
[00:24:58] does, you know, uh, have a lot of clients that currently have a 3% rate and is able to, um,
[00:25:05] you know, convince them to consider maybe giving that up or if they're a first time home buyer,
[00:25:10] why might they consider taking this rate? First time home buyers don't typically care that much,
[00:25:15] right? But, but certainly people who own a home do. So that's something that to think put that
[00:25:19] in acting as a top loan officer or acting as an agent that is getting, uh, working with lots of
[00:25:25] buyers right now. What might the top agent? What might they be saying to, now you don't have to
[00:25:30] answer that chat GBT or answer that. So if you write this out and get really specific about who's
[00:25:35] answering the question, you will get some pretty cool answers. Is anyone tried this approach?
[00:25:44] Yeah, and it works, right?
[00:25:45] Mm hmm.
[00:25:46] Mm hmm.
[00:25:46] And I was like, I'm afraid I, you know, it's like, it's really because it's close to you
[00:25:53] telling us that our, you find and get like, rolled down. Yeah. Yeah.
[00:25:59] Yeah. So that's like, other than it, it starts to get familiar.
[00:26:04] It would tell you what you're not flexible. Yeah. And by the way, if you don't get a good
[00:26:09] result, you can just write in, you know, um, this is a pretty general, you know, I need more specific
[00:26:14] advice. Or can you find five other, maybe, uh, suggestions, right? You could just keep asking
[00:26:21] questions. So we're going to number one, define, role and context. So we're going to define who can
[00:26:27] answer this and what characteristics might they have? Okay. So in and of itself, if that's all you
[00:26:33] ever did with your queries, this will dramatically improve the results. Like that's like the most
[00:26:37] important thing. Again, acting as a top food critic, whatever that even means, right? But it gave
[00:26:43] me, and then it gave me back to the food critic one, it gave me its, um, it's reasoning for why a
[00:26:48] food critic would like this particular place. So I was like, oh, that's pretty cool. Now I don't,
[00:26:53] you know, who knows? Maybe it just picked three at random. I don't know. But at least I, I think it
[00:26:56] was helpful. It was better than I could have done on my own. Number two is specify the business
[00:27:01] goal. So not just like I have this problem where buyers are waiting for rates to come down,
[00:27:06] or they're sitting on the fence, or listings are sitting on the market. What are we, what are we
[00:27:12] trying to accomplish? We're trying to get buyers off the fence. We're trying to get people to
[00:27:16] understand that now might be a good time to consider buying because not as much competition and,
[00:27:21] you know, maybe it'd be better to do it now than later. Who knows? I don't know. You guys are the
[00:27:26] market experts. You know, you know, the answers to those questions. But certainly there's people
[00:27:29] that are getting doing business right now despite those challenges. So when you get the goal,
[00:27:33] the goal is what? I want more listings. I want more buyers off the fence. I want the best restaurants
[00:27:40] here in the area. Right? So we want to get very specific about not just I want 10 social media
[00:27:45] post ideas. I want 10 social media post ideas that will encourage people to consider buying even
[00:27:50] though they might think it's not a great time to buy. Okay. So make sense? Cool. So you're going to
[00:27:59] get all this by the way. So don't worry about writing it down if you feel free to, but I'm going to go
[00:28:03] through it fairly quickly. And yeah. So just making sure I covered everything. Yeah. That looks good.
[00:28:09] Okay. Let's move on to so we're going to give it who's going to answer this and what's our goal?
[00:28:15] What are we trying and the more specific you get the better with your goal? So it's like I want to
[00:28:21] lose weight. Okay. How much? Do you want to lose weight or do you want to lose fat? Do you want to
[00:28:26] burn muscle? Probably not. Do you want to lose fat? Probably. Right? So I hear this all the time. It's
[00:28:31] like I lost 20 pounds. Right? People we talk we talk like this because we look at the number on
[00:28:35] the scale. It's like what does that mean? It doesn't it might be really bad to lose 20 pounds
[00:28:39] because if you're losing muscle that is really bad. Right? So it's like we want to get specific.
[00:28:43] How do I burn more fat? How do I build more muscle? You know, how do I, you know, that kind of thing?
[00:28:48] So okay. We're going to also give it some constraints and boundaries because we want to make sure,
[00:28:53] you know, it's it's like a child. You have to tell it you can you can do this and not that, right?
[00:28:58] These are the boundaries that you play play in. So it needs to make sure that it aligns with who you
[00:29:03] are and and what you're capable of, right? If you're a part-time agent and it's like I need you to,
[00:29:09] you know, go on Facebook four hours a day and do research on every one of your prospects and then
[00:29:14] comment on every one of their posts like well, that's probably not realistic, right? For somebody who's
[00:29:19] maybe it's realistic for for some of us, but other of us have other we have families we have other
[00:29:23] things going on we have other responsibilities and and you know, we're not going to be able to do
[00:29:27] that and that's going to give us a result where like I don't care I can't do that. So we want to give
[00:29:30] it very specific instructions about how much time I have to do these tasks, right? If it's a you're
[00:29:35] asking for a solution to a task, you know, how can I do this very how can do this quickly? Maybe I,
[00:29:41] how can I do all my social media, you know, posting or what what I call research and developments? By
[00:29:47] the way, if you're not using social media just as a side for research and development, like I don't
[00:29:57] do any great content, let's like do this, there's a great idea, like that's great. If you're just like, I
[00:30:01] just sold home, you know, look at me, like, okay, you know, fine, but but what you really want to think
[00:30:06] about is how do I learn about people on social media, right? Social media is a great place to know
[00:30:11] what's going on in here. We were just talking about somebody here works at a firm at a friend of mine
[00:30:15] owns and he pays attention to what his agents do in their personal life because he follows them on
[00:30:20] social. What do you think that does for the people at his office? They think that's probably pretty
[00:30:24] cool, right? They're like, wow, you know, it's going on in my life. Yeah, he follows you on social.
[00:30:28] He makes it a point to do that, right? So I just my little plug for you social to learn about people
[00:30:33] so that you can call them up and go like, I just saw you went on a vacation. I like, maybe it's not
[00:30:37] always fun to go, are you ready to buy and sell a home, right? But you could call it, see, you just
[00:30:40] went to Cabo, like, tell me about it. Was it awesome? Like, maybe I should go. Would you recommend it?
[00:30:45] Right? Those are wonderful reasons to pick up the phone. So that's my little side thing. I'll get
[00:30:48] off that. But take that as a little bonus tip. And top agents do that, right? They develop
[00:30:53] relationships. They're kind of okay, I'll get off that. We're going to talk about boundaries.
[00:30:57] So we want to tell the AI agent, here's how much time I have. Here's what I'm capable of.
[00:31:05] So then it doesn't give me some unrealistic idea of what it thinks I should do if I had unlimited
[00:31:10] time because it might not know that you are a mother of a parent of three children. And by the way,
[00:31:16] you also work another job and you take care of elderly parents and you've got a million other
[00:31:21] things going on. So you got to make sure it knows what you're capable of as far as time and
[00:31:26] and your skill set and all of that. So here, I've got a few examples of that. Now, this is also
[00:31:35] really important, requesting multiple perspectives. So perspectives being who, you know, who else
[00:31:43] might be able to sort of see this from a different angle. You know, I always say, I, even though I'm
[00:31:49] technically in this business, I don't know that much about real estate truthfully. So when people
[00:31:53] ask me for like, how's the market doing? I'm like, oh, no, you don't want my answer on that because
[00:31:57] all I do is just regurgitate what I've heard from other people. I'm not there out there in the
[00:32:01] trenches. You need to talk to a practicing agent like they know what's going on, you know, they know
[00:32:05] in their market. There are boots on the ground. I'm like, I'm just the guy that reads, you know,
[00:32:10] reads articles. So, or I talk to top producers and I hear what they say, but they're out there doing it.
[00:32:15] So I would want to know things like as a top producer. So I do a, I do a video series. I just
[00:32:22] started this. I thought it was kind of fun. You can subscribe to it on any of my social channels,
[00:32:26] which is the keeping it real podcast. I run everywhere, TikTok, Facebook, Instagram, all that. So
[00:32:30] YouTube, LinkedIn, everywhere. So I started doing this. I just got a cool animation for it that I'm
[00:32:36] really excited about, but it's an AI agent minute. And it's basically giving you a prompt. I'm not
[00:32:45] what I think is a good idea. Here's an idea for an agent to consider using to help grow their
[00:32:49] business. And I give you the prompt and explain why I think it's a good idea. And you know, that's
[00:32:53] obviously all free. You can check that out. But what I do is to get to make sure it is a good
[00:32:58] idea for a good idea for agents who might be at a certain level of their production is I ask chat
[00:33:05] GBT, assume you are an agent of this production this many years in the business. Would this prompt
[00:33:12] idea that I'm going about to share in a video with this actually with this land with you? Like,
[00:33:17] is this something that my girlfriend's a trial attorney? So she deals with juries and she does
[00:33:23] civil cases. And juries are really important in civil cases because juries dictate how much money
[00:33:27] people get. Judges don't, which is really interesting. I didn't know this till I started dating her.
[00:33:32] And so a jury might think somebody should get $40 million, which by the way is insane to me,
[00:33:39] for whatever the reasoning is. But yeah, juries will be like, sure, that seems right. But so she'll
[00:33:44] ask me a lot of times, I'm going to give you this argument. What do you think about it? And I'm not,
[00:33:49] I'm just, you know, I don't know anything about the law. So she gets my perspective because she's
[00:33:53] like, she's too close to it, right? So sometimes we're a little too close to things, right? So we want
[00:33:58] to ask from a perspective of the person who were maybe trying to influence or the problem we're trying
[00:34:03] to solve, you know, let's remember not everyone knows about rates. Not everyone knows about, you know,
[00:34:07] time on market, right? But our buyers and sellers, they got their own lives. So as a person who
[00:34:14] doesn't really follow the market, how might they perceive the suggestion I'm about to give them?
[00:34:18] Right? She does this with chat, she'd be, too, where she throws in, I'm about to make this argument,
[00:34:22] to, here's, here's the type of jury member that we're probably going to have on the, on the stand.
[00:34:27] She throws this in and she goes, what do you think about this argument? Or she asks me, we do both.
[00:34:31] So we want to get through different perspectives. So again, give me three marketing ideas as if
[00:34:35] you're my branding coach. Wow, that's a great one. So Kim Ripper was mentioned by Jennifer.
[00:34:41] Kim Ripper comes on my show once a month. She's from Brooklyn. She's awesome. She's an ex-netflix
[00:34:46] executive and she's worked in, she, she set up us weekly's video division. So she's like, comes from
[00:34:54] that world. She's just like the coolest person. I love Kim and she's nice enough to come on my show
[00:34:58] once a month and say, here's how you do video. Anyway, a little plug for Kim. She's awesome. If you
[00:35:03] just subscribe to my show just for Kim's stuff, you'll get so much out of it. But anyway, Kim's a
[00:35:08] branding coach. That's what she teaches is like, here's how to, here's how to present yourself on video.
[00:35:12] So I might say as a video branding coach, I want to make this video where I'm seen as an expert
[00:35:16] around why, why people who have a 3% mortgage may want to consider looking at a property to,
[00:35:24] to buy and maybe sell their existing property, even though they might be getting this larger,
[00:35:29] you know, larger interest rate. Makes sense? Okay. So you want to get a lot of different ideas.
[00:35:35] So think about, and again, what we're really doing is we're thinking like a consultant, right?
[00:35:40] Consulments aren't necessarily experts at solving the problems that they go into solve.
[00:35:45] They're experts at figuring out who's what's the problem and what's the outcome and like who's
[00:35:51] the use case? Like how would we actually use it? And, and then they go out and find the experts to
[00:35:56] tell them what, you know, then they tell they oftentimes tell the client exactly what the experts say.
[00:36:01] Okay. And so multiple, sorry, multiple perspectives. And then last is role reversal and iteration.
[00:36:09] Okay. So what this just means is the first answer, sometimes it's the best answer, oftentimes,
[00:36:16] why not try again? See what you can get a couple other times. This sounds like a lot of work.
[00:36:20] It really isn't. Once you get the idea of this, you'll just constantly be chatting with chat
[00:36:25] GBT. And what's really cool about chat GBT and some of the other ones is you can just talk to it now.
[00:36:29] If it is anyone using the talk to feature, it's like having a conversation. By the way,
[00:36:34] pro tip here, if you are not practicing your objection handling or your listing presentation or
[00:36:43] your your phone calls, your client care calls, or I got to deliver some bad news to a client. If
[00:36:55] going to chat GBT and say, I need you to play the role of this particular person and you need to
[00:37:01] throw every objection you can at me, then I want you to judge my answers as, you know, put them on a
[00:37:07] scale of one to ten of whatever you want to do it. And, and then, you know, you can just go back and
[00:37:12] forth and keep refining it until chat GBT is like, that's a pretty good answer. I'm doing a I'm doing
[00:37:20] Compass. He's a he has a large team in the city. And Ben does this with all of his all of his team
[00:37:28] members. They all have chat GBT and they all practice. He goes, I used to have to coach every single one
[00:37:33] for these like role playing. He goes, we don't do that anymore. We just we train chat GBT. They
[00:37:39] actually even trained a model within chat GBT, exactly how he thinks those answers should go. He
[00:37:45] trained chat GBT and then his agent saw go into that chat GBT little language model and then they
[00:37:51] are trained from the it's like, I'm like, that's brilliant. Like that's so smart, right? So that's a
[00:37:56] great idea too. While you're driving around, ask chat GBT like, hey, quiz me a little bit. Like,
[00:38:02] imagine you're going to throw this objection at me or imagine you're going to say, you know,
[00:38:06] whatever, whatever challenges you guys experience out in the world, right? These are great things.
[00:38:10] I'm a recruiter. So I do this. I do it. I should do it more. But I should be doing this when people
[00:38:15] are like, why should I join your company? There's 200 other companies to join. It's like, that's true.
[00:38:20] That's a good question. And I better have an answer that's pretty compelling. And I've been doing
[00:38:24] this 14 years. I'm like, I got to still sharpen my skills there because there's some great
[00:38:28] firms out there that I compete with. And it's like, oh, yeah, there's some great ones. So I have to
[00:38:33] continue to sharpen my skills. So that's just my little pro tip there. But role reversal, right? So,
[00:38:39] here's great. It gives you one answer. You're like, okay, critique this. If you are my competitor,
[00:38:46] so I do this with recruiting. We have a very specific kind of offering that we offer that's a little
[00:38:53] bit more unique than not that it's better or worse, but just different from what other firms offer.
[00:38:57] So I'm like, okay, imagine you're a competitor that offers a totally different thing. And what would
[00:39:01] they say to hearing about my thing? They might be like, oh, you don't want to go there. They've
[00:39:05] things that we don't have or we have that they don't, you know, whatever. So I want to hear that
[00:39:10] stuff because that helps me, you know, better compete in the marketplace, right? Okay, there we go.
[00:39:17] All right. So you guys are going to get all this. And I'm going to just kind of re,
[00:39:22] let's just regurgitate this. Let's make it really simple and clear. So I basically just broke it
[00:39:28] down into a really simple, quick template. And this way, it's a little one-pageer. You just copy and
[00:39:35] haste this, throw it in a, throw it in a notepad file. So you have it. So you don't have to like
[00:39:39] think about this acting as a expert in whatever I'm looking to solve. Here's my goal. This is what I
[00:39:46] want, I need solved. And I want to get really specific. Here are my constraints. Here's what I have
[00:39:51] available. These are my resources I have, right? And here's the time I have. Give me suggestions,
[00:39:56] suggestions from multiple perspectives. And then let's critique it, you know, because there's
[00:40:02] always better ideas. And then let's refine and improve it. And, oh, and then also, I didn't,
[00:40:09] this is just kind of a low-bonus thing. Deliver the answer in a certain format, right? So step-by-step
[00:40:14] plan, content calendar, script with examples, right? Because what Chagging BT is really good at now
[00:40:19] is actually asking you what format at the end, but like they'll say like, would you like me to do this?
[00:40:24] To put this in a cool presentation for you. So it's pretty good about that, but feel free just to,
[00:40:29] if it doesn't, suggest that, that you could throw that in as well, say, you know, I was currently
[00:40:35] asking, I was asking it for seven ideas for new prompts to consider for my little AI agent minute
[00:40:41] video thing. And it said, would you like me to build you a content calendar with these seven ideas?
[00:40:47] I was like, oh yeah, that's a great idea. I wish I had thought of that. It did it for me. And then
[00:40:51] it said, when are you free to do these? And I was like, oh yeah, now I need to schedule it, right?
[00:40:55] So, and then it was like, okay, do you want me to put these on the calendar for you? Or do you want
[00:40:58] to do it? I was like, oh, it's so great. So you can really use chat GBT as a virtual assistant in a
[00:41:02] lot of ways too. Does anyone use it as a virtual assistant to like, yeah, pretty cool. How do you use it?
[00:41:11] Yeah. So you'll like throw in your to-dos and be like, what should I do when or here's my,
[00:41:17] here's my availability brilliant. That's a great one, right? Yes.
[00:41:31] Wow. That's a great one. Mindset, right? Like, uh, yeah, I mean, that's a wonderful one.
[00:41:38] Getting in the right mindset, having maybe some gratitude or some perspective, you know, like,
[00:41:43] I got another day. Like, a lot of people didn't get another day today. We got another day, right?
[00:41:48] That might be something that chat GBT can remind you of, right? Like, you should, you know,
[00:41:52] you should really think about, you know, how lucky we are. And that goes with those kind of things.
[00:41:55] So mindset is everything. What a great idea. And, you know, give me a little meditation to get my
[00:42:00] mind centered and focused on being, you know, calm or being, you know, productive or being grateful
[00:42:07] or whatever feelings and mindsets we want to have, you know, help, you know, help me stay on track
[00:42:13] today. You know, I put in problems. I tend to get distracted with social media. I tend, I mean,
[00:42:19] that's actually not one of mine. I get distracted in a lot of other ways, but probably a lot of us
[00:42:23] deal with like social media stuff because you guys have to be on social all the time. I don't.
[00:42:27] So I'm not as trapped as you guys might be. But that becomes a problem because you start doing
[00:42:32] scrolling. And then all of a sudden an hour goes by and maybe you're like, oh, I didn't
[00:42:36] shouldn't have done that. Okay. Well, tell chat GBT about that. I've got this problem. My girlfriend
[00:42:41] has this problem. She, she's like, she, she has a thing on her phone now where I only know the
[00:42:47] password. And it like locks her out of, I think, Instagram or something. I don't know. It locks her out
[00:42:53] because she's like, I'm not to be trusted. This is like a very successful, effective individual
[00:42:59] who is a slave to it, just like we're all slaves to certain urges that we can't, you know, do all
[00:43:05] on our own. So as to at GBT for help with that stuff, you know, I get distracted reading stuff on
[00:43:10] Reddit, right? That's kind of my version of social media. And I'm reading and I go down rabbit holes.
[00:43:14] And I'm like, what am I doing? Like it's, I need, I need help with this. So I asked chat GBT,
[00:43:19] how do I stay focused? Okay. Guys, it is 10 o'clock. I want to share with you. How much time do we have?
[00:43:27] Are we out of time? We have to 11. Okay, cool. So is this been useful, by the way? Are we getting it?
[00:43:37] Okay, cool. Cool. Well, that's all I, that's all I could have asked for. But I want to share with you.
[00:43:42] I also have 10 prompts that again, you might read these and go, I could write a better prompt.
[00:43:48] Cool. Do it, right? But I have prompts that I have talked to top agents who are using prompts
[00:43:54] just like these. And these are ones I haven't created myself. I actually got from top agents. So I
[00:43:59] figured, you know, they know better than me. So these are all different prompts. You know, I've
[00:44:04] listing persuasion. I've daily prospecting, objection handling. What else do I have? Hyper local
[00:44:10] market reports. Here's another way you can use chat GBT on your way to a showing. Ask chat GBT.
[00:44:16] Tell me everything you know about this address. Tell me everything. We got to get better than that.
[00:44:22] Acting as a first time home buyer who's moving into the area who doesn't know anything about this.
[00:44:29] Assuming that's your client or whoever your client is. Maybe they live there 30 years and whatever
[00:44:34] whoever that is. Acting as somebody who's considering buying this property. What might I want to know
[00:44:39] as this person before making a decision? I did this with my condo because I have to I'm going to be
[00:44:46] listing it shortly. And I was shocked at what it knew about my condo. Like I don't know where it got
[00:44:51] the information. I don't know if it's I don't think it's tied into. Well, it's probably tied in the
[00:44:56] MLS in some capacity because MLS is kind of everywhere now. But anyway, it knew what kind of countertops
[00:45:01] I had. I was shocked. Like it was amazing. And my place is only it's all it was built four years ago.
[00:45:06] It's not like it's been on you know. So anyway, it knows stuff. Or you might say like as a mother
[00:45:12] of three or as a family with young children, what might they want to know about the area nearest
[00:45:18] ex-address? Right? That's a good stuff. Or where's the best grocery store nearby? Or where's the
[00:45:25] closest park? Or you know, these are things that like you used to have to figure out on your own.
[00:45:29] It's kind of a lot, especially if you're going all over the place, right? It's tough. So think
[00:45:34] about questions like that. Talk it into chat, CBT on the drive over. Like, hey, what would you tell
[00:45:40] somebody looking to move in this area? What are the three coolest things about this area? What's
[00:45:45] some cool bits of trivia about this neighborhood? Or this property? Or the suburb? Or, right? These
[00:45:51] would be kind of fun things because then you can just seem like an expert, right? Even even if you
[00:45:56] didn't know it five minutes ago. So how else? I would love to know how else you guys are using
[00:46:02] chat, CBT. So start thinking about that. Thank you for those two great ideas. I love the one about
[00:46:09] the morning meditation. That is really great. I should, I'm going to start doing that. So just think
[00:46:13] about that because I'm going to bring it back to you guys in a second. Have you give me some ideas?
[00:46:17] And if you don't know because you haven't used it, how might you use it? So let's all think of one
[00:46:21] prompt that because we could share it with everybody. So let's think about something that we think
[00:46:26] that might be helpful. It does have to be perfect. But just the idea, the kernel of the idea and
[00:46:30] we'll get some, we'll have some hands in a minute. So social media content calendar, I sort of
[00:46:34] talked about this. Fizz bows and expires. Anyone doing fizz bows and expires? Some of us, those are
[00:46:40] tough, right? Ooh, you got to have, you got to have a real strong will to do fizz bows and expires
[00:46:45] because those are, that's a tough one. But are there people that have success with that? I'm
[00:46:50] like to me, that's like the hardest call you can make. There are people that love it. They're like,
[00:46:54] oh, I love it. I get deals out of it. I'm like, man, it's like going into the lion's den with those,
[00:47:00] those, they could be tough. They could yell that. But people have success with it. So that would be
[00:47:05] a great one. If you want to try fizz bows and expires, you know, you should get some, get some,
[00:47:09] get some training on those first. Because those can take you down. Has anyone, has anyone tried it and
[00:47:15] been like, what's that? Yeah, yeah, right? But has anyone tried to, am I telling the truth on
[00:47:23] fizz bows and expires? They can be tricky. And I don't mean to suggest there's anything wrong
[00:47:26] with that. Like tricky is good in a way because it scares away most other competition. So,
[00:47:32] and the people that are good at it, love it, that the fact that it's hard because other people
[00:47:36] don't do it. So I'm not saying don't do it. I think it's great. I just think it takes a very
[00:47:41] certain type of person that can handle some good rejection. And most of us are, you know, I don't
[00:47:46] know, I'm too, I'm too sensitive for that. But, but I appreciate that. I mean, I'm in recruiting. I
[00:47:53] do. But that's okay. And it projections an issue for you. Throw that in a chat, CBT. I struggle with
[00:47:59] rejection. It really hurts my feelings. It bums me out when somebody's like, hey, but, you know,
[00:48:05] close friend, I went with another agent, right? Like, how do I best handle that myself? Maybe you
[00:48:11] get some personal guidance there. And then maybe, how might I, how might I, how might you recommend,
[00:48:17] how to top agents, you know, minimize the probability of that happening, right? Because it's
[00:48:23] probably, I mean, sometimes that just happens, you know, somebody just makes a different decision.
[00:48:28] But sometimes it's on us. Sometimes it's like, well, we didn't stay in touch with that person.
[00:48:31] We were a secret REALTOR. We didn't ever tell that person. When you're ready, please call me.
[00:48:35] Or, you know, if you hear anybody out there at your job that needs help, please tell them about me,
[00:48:39] right? So there's, there's, these are ways you can consider. Just think about always be thinking
[00:48:44] about what are the problems of my business? And you always have problems. I have problems. We
[00:48:49] all have problems. Nobody has nobody's free of problems. Even the top producers, I have, um,
[00:48:55] Carrie McCormick, who's, if you, I don't know if you guys know Carrie, she works a little bit
[00:48:58] closer to the city mostly, but she's like one of the very top producers in all of the Chicago
[00:49:02] and area. Um, I don't, she's having her best year ever this year. And it's 250 million, I think,
[00:49:09] so far this year, all herself 115 sales all herself. Like no team crazy. Like she knows things.
[00:49:17] Right? So that's why I have run my show because she just was able to share things like that. But
[00:49:21] what my point is, is there are solutions to these problems, right? And a lot of times it's skill.
[00:49:26] You just got to learn a new skill. Cool part is, chat, GBT can do that. A lot of times it's
[00:49:30] knowledge or just knowing the answer to something, chat, GBT can help you with that. Right? So we have,
[00:49:36] you know, managing brokers and we have trainers and coaches and some of us have maybe pay for a coach
[00:49:40] or we have an accountability partner. By the way, if you don't have a real life in person accountability
[00:49:45] partner, please get one. Like please, please, please, we all need one. I need one. We, I, my CEO,
[00:49:51] every Monday, uh, uh, who by the way, we hired, we hired for him to do this part of his job. He has,
[00:49:59] he's like, what did you do this week? Like I don't like to answer that question because I've been
[00:50:03] there 14 years and I like help build the company. I'm like, no, I need that because I need somebody
[00:50:07] to be like, Hey, you know, what'd you do? Like what are you doing this week? Are you on target?
[00:50:11] So we all need help. So get somebody who can help keep you on track. Are there any Brian Bafini
[00:50:16] people out here? Yes. Brian Bafini is all about accountability, right? He had Joe Niego was his
[00:50:21] accountability partner. He was just a REALTOR in Chicago and he was in San Diego, I think. And they
[00:50:27] would call each other up every day and go, what'd you do today? Did you win the day? Right? Very smart.
[00:50:31] Right? So those are, that's free. And Chatchy BD can sort of help you do that, but I would get a
[00:50:36] real life person because then you can share ideas and you'll help each other and, you know, it's
[00:50:40] really fun to do that. Uh, I have an accountability partner and, uh, keeps me on target. Um, okay.
[00:50:46] Sorry, I got a little bit off track there. Uh, open house conversion blueprints. How many people
[00:50:52] find that I just, I'm not having the success converting open house leads that I would really like
[00:50:58] to have. Is that okay? Good. There's some honest, honest answers here. Good. Uh, now for anyone who
[00:51:04] didn't raise their hand, it's like, I know how to do this. You guys should find those people.
[00:51:08] I feel like, what are you doing? I want to hear. I've had the way I have an episode. I'll share it
[00:51:12] with Jennifer because I finally talked to somebody who I think has like cracked the code from San Diego,
[00:51:18] I believe. Um, just a random top agent. And he was like, Oh, I want to talk about open houses.
[00:51:23] He does his team. They do 20 to 40 open houses a weekend. No joke. He's in his 20s.
[00:51:31] This, I am, you know what he does? He calls other agents. And he's like, can I do an open house
[00:51:36] for your listing, which by the way, you guys should do too. If you don't have enough listings,
[00:51:39] at least for people in your own office, like, sure, try that. But he does it for agents at other firms.
[00:51:45] And like, which I don't think we can do an Illinois. So, yeah, I don't think that's, I don't,
[00:51:49] don't do that. But I think in California, for some reason, that's okay. So he does that.
[00:51:53] And they, these other agents love it because he puts on such an event. So I'll send you guys a
[00:52:00] link to that because you'll be shocked at all the work he does for these. Like, it's crazy.
[00:52:04] But it's a solution, right? So if you're not having luck with open houses, cool.
[00:52:09] Also appreciate that honesty. Now let's learn how to do it.
[00:52:12] ChatshipyT can help you do that too. But I have a good episode to share with you that.
[00:52:16] So open house conversion blueprint.
[00:52:20] Local authority positioning. Ooh, who is, who is constantly trying to position themselves
[00:52:25] as an expert in a geographic area? Are you guys well do it? Yes.
[00:52:30] Good idea, right? Right. I'll give you my own little little tips on this, by the way.
[00:52:35] I'm currently talking to an agent who's now my accountability partner. She's great.
[00:52:40] She's not at my firm. She's a baritone owner. And we just kind of hit it off as as friends.
[00:52:44] She is Elmwood Park, you know, in closer to the city. And she's like, I, she thought of a problem.
[00:52:54] Now this isn't a ChatshipyT thing. It's just we'll go off script for just a second. But I'll talk
[00:52:57] about how she solved this problem because I thought it was so brilliant. You could use it yourself.
[00:53:01] She thought, you know, after the pandemic, people were like, the dad is in. Like, it wasn't good for us,
[00:53:06] right? It wasn't good for us personally, right? We didn't see enough people. We weren't around
[00:53:10] enough people. People are lonelier than ever. Social media has made us disconnected. We know
[00:53:14] that this is all true. We know what it does to kids, you know, it was, it wasn't great. So people
[00:53:20] are lonely. My girlfriend, she is like, I don't have enough girlfriends. So she's like, I bet there's
[00:53:25] like a friend group like, you know, some sort of organization that can have, you know, get you to
[00:53:30] like meet other women. She wanted to meet more women specifically. She found one and she's now
[00:53:34] doing that. She has like 10 new friends. It's amazing. But back to this woman in Elmwood Park,
[00:53:39] this REALTOR. She's like, I want to be the expert in Elmwood Park. And what's the problem? What's
[00:53:43] a problem? Well, I, I'm really lonely. I'm a mom. And I don't have a lot of friends here because
[00:53:50] for whatever reason, they've moved away. And I want to make more friends. So she goes, I bet there's
[00:53:55] more people like me out there. So she goes on to her local Facebook Elmwood Park community group that
[00:54:01] she's not an admin of. She's just a member. And she says, Hey, is anyone out there feeling lonely?
[00:54:06] Do you guys want more friends? Just curious, taking the temperature of the room. And she got a lot of
[00:54:10] people like, yeah, I'm kind of lonely. And so she goes, hmm, I should probably work on creating a
[00:54:15] solution to this. So she went to a local coffee shop, who by the way, local coffee shops, especially
[00:54:22] like the nonchains, the independent ones, they got it rough, right? They're competing with Starbucks.
[00:54:26] And she's like, I want to support this local, you know, merchant because they're in my area. And
[00:54:30] I like them. So she's like, Hey, can I do a meet up here for just for like people in Elmwood Park
[00:54:35] who want to make friends? And they're like, yeah, yes, because you're going to buy coffee at her place.
[00:54:40] Sure. So she's like, cool. So she went on and she goes, we're doing this meet up group, you know,
[00:54:45] hey, just want to meet more people kind of learn more about, you know, Elmwood Park and just hang out.
[00:54:52] And she got in her first one, she got six people to show up. Now these are people she didn't know.
[00:54:57] That's a lot of people. I mean, can you, that takes courage to walk into a place where you don't know
[00:55:02] anybody. She got six people to do that. And she was like, Oh my God. So she goes, she, they,
[00:55:06] she, they, she took pictures. She shared it with the group. She's like, Can I, can I share all this?
[00:55:11] Everyone just hung out and talked and got to know each other. She's like, we're doing it again.
[00:55:14] And now she thinks I'm going to get 20 people the next time. Now she goes, I didn't even mention
[00:55:19] that I'm a REALTOR because she doesn't really have to at that point. That she's, everyone's going
[00:55:22] to learn that she's a REALTOR because they're going to go, What do you do? Right? Like that's brilliant.
[00:55:25] Right? And now Elmwood Park, she's, she's valuable to the community because Elmwood Park probably
[00:55:32] wants more people walking around, you know, hanging out at the local establishments,
[00:55:36] getting to know each other, having a more neighborly kind of community feel. Great for everyone.
[00:55:42] What a great idea. Right? So think about that. Like she's like, I need to solve my own problem
[00:55:47] of loneliness. How could I work this into my business without being salesy without being like,
[00:55:51] Hey, you know, I'm the greatest REALTOR in the area. She's not like that. She's like, I don't like,
[00:55:56] she's with Brian Biffini. She has a coach. She's like, I don't like doing pop buys. She's like,
[00:56:00] I don't want to do them. I don't want to just pop my clients house. It freaks me out. I'm like,
[00:56:04] cool, don't do that. Do this instead. You'll meet new people and you'll add more to your database.
[00:56:09] You know, great idea. So cool, right? So these are the ideas I get to talk to when I talk to top agents.
[00:56:14] And she's not even a top agent. She's like on her way up. But when I talk to top agents,
[00:56:18] they all have stuff like this. So you'll hear a lot of that on my podcast. So local authority
[00:56:23] positioning. Oh, here's the other thing she's doing. I'm sorry. This is really why I brought her up.
[00:56:28] She's making content around for video, social media, specifically around what two people who
[00:56:34] are thinking about moving to Elmwood Park need to know. Not just real estate stuff. Like, where's
[00:56:39] the best grocery store? Where's the best dentist? Where's the best hair salon? You know, where's my
[00:56:44] favorite local book shop or whatever she's into? You know, hey, I'm a mom. Where are the best
[00:56:49] resources for moms with kids in grade school? You know, where the whatever? I mean, I want to meet
[00:56:54] friends. Here's where you can go to do that. She makes videos about that. And guess how valuable that
[00:56:59] is to people who are moving to Elmwood Park? Super valuable. And she puts those on YouTube so that
[00:57:05] lives forever. Because on Facebook and Instagram and TikTok, those are more disposable, right? They're
[00:57:14] so she does that as well. She posted them on Instagram and Facebook too. But like, really smart,
[00:57:20] right? That's how you become a local expert. You share information. And by the way, where can you
[00:57:26] get ideas about how to become a local expert? Shout, GBT. How could I best position? I want to be the
[00:57:32] crystal lake person. I want to I want people to know is by the way, is there not an amazing butcher
[00:57:37] in crystal lake? Am I wrong about that? Is it on Main Street? Is that right? Or maybe not Main Street?
[00:57:42] Is that what's okay? But there is like some unreal butcher out here that's like everyone raves about,
[00:57:48] okay, because I feel like I've known that. I would go to that butcher or whoever, whatever
[00:57:52] retailer I like, be like, can I interview you for two minutes? And just I work with people in your
[00:57:58] community. And I just want to make sure everybody knows that you're the best butcher in the area.
[00:58:02] They're going to be like, yes, please. I need more business, right? And you're doing it for free.
[00:58:07] That's really generous. And they're going to share it because you're going to tag them.
[00:58:12] Right? So think about content around local authority positioning. Call the local newspaper if you
[00:58:19] have people that read newspapers. I mean, I don't know if people are still reading newspapers now,
[00:58:23] but if they are, I would go, hey, editorial desk, when you need a quote about what's going on in
[00:58:29] the housing market, please call me. I interviewed somebody who got a ton of business that way. I don't
[00:58:34] remember where in the country they are. I was like, I would have never thought of that. That's brilliant.
[00:58:38] Oh, it's in Colorado. I'm like, really? She's like, yeah, they call me every two weeks for a quote.
[00:58:43] I'm like, does that help you? She's like, it doesn't hurt me. I was like, that's awesome. Great idea.
[00:58:49] Okay. All right. I think we're good. We get it. I don't need to keep stepping on all this. We get
[00:58:54] it, right? Personal brand audit. That's a good one. What's my brand? That you should really figure out.
[00:59:00] And I don't want to go through a whole branding exercise because even though I'm a branding guy,
[00:59:04] like you can ask Chad Chibitita to walk you through a branding exercise that you should. What's my brand?
[00:59:09] How should I develop my brand? What are the feelings I want people to have about me? What are the
[00:59:12] values I need to have so that what are the actions I need to take that are in alignment with those values?
[00:59:18] Those kind of things. How do I present that to the world? Chad Chibitita can help you with all that.
[00:59:23] Okay. So you guys are going to get all this. Is this helpful?
[00:59:28] Cool. Am I teaching you more of a way to think about how to approach problems?
[00:59:33] So you should be in like, what are my problems mode all the time? Because now you have like the
[00:59:39] Oracle at Delphi that is actually going to help you solve them that you don't have to pay other than
[00:59:43] maybe 20 bucks a month if you want to. Man, coaches are expensive. And I'm not saying don't have a
[00:59:49] coach. You should like get a coach to. But still, if maybe you maybe that's not in the cards for you
[00:59:55] at the moment because they're really expensive. Well, Chad Chibitita isn't, right? And Chad Chibitita
[00:59:59] might even know more than the coaches. So anyway, get an accountability partner, please. Okay, let's think
[01:00:04] about everyone's got a problem. Let's think about it. Could be maybe it's a productivity issue. Maybe it's
[01:00:11] maybe it's following up with your prospects. Maybe it's not the open house itself. Maybe it's like
[01:00:18] following up with the people from the open house. Or maybe it's I sold a home to somebody three years
[01:00:23] ago on I don't really know how to like stay in touch. Like it's not they're not going to buy or sell
[01:00:27] right now. Like I don't know what to do. Right? So does anyone have just a general general or specific
[01:00:33] problem? Let's help you solve it right now and not to give you the answers but help you figure out a
[01:00:38] way to craft an answer in Chad Chibitita craft a question. So think of a problem you're having in
[01:00:43] your business. If someone brave enough to volunteer, be vulnerable. Okay, I'll give you one. I'll give you one.
[01:00:52] I don't always follow up with my prospects. Does anyone can anyone relate to that? Yeah. Okay. Is that a
[01:00:57] good one? Okay. Good. So okay. There we go. All right. So how might you help me if you were crafting
[01:01:06] a an answer in Chad Chibitita or a question? What might we what might we ask Chad Chibitita about
[01:01:11] how to help DJ? Well, we need to know why what what what I'm doing. What I'm not doing. Okay, I have
[01:01:16] so many prospects that I oftentimes don't remember even though I have a CRM. I don't remember. Oh,
[01:01:24] I should have like I need somebody to say here's what I need. I'll tell you the answer I need. I
[01:01:28] need Chad. I need somebody to hand me a list every day and say here's the 15 people you need to call
[01:01:34] the day instead of me trying to figure it out. That's the solution I probably need. So how might I
[01:01:40] ask Chad Chibitita to help me with that? Acting as a who would solve that problem? Time management
[01:01:48] expert, productivity coach, something like that. Person who is a top real estate recruiter.
[01:01:56] Person who yeah, something like that. That's pretty reasonable. So that could be the role. Okay,
[01:02:02] so let's go back to the the template. By the way, you're helping me do this. This is great. I need
[01:02:09] to go back to my office and make these calls. Oops, I just hit something. Here we go. Okay.
[01:02:18] So acting as a here's who can solve this problem. I want to make 15 phone calls today and for the next,
[01:02:27] you know, I want to make 15 phone calls every day. Okay, here's my problem. I've got four other
[01:02:34] side businesses that are related to real estate that I work on. I have 700 agents and I have other
[01:02:41] things I do in my day that aren't unrelated to this that get in the way. So those are those are my
[01:02:48] constraints. I have all these things flying at me and it's easy for me to take something that's
[01:02:54] coming at me versus going, okay, like ignore that and go straight into what the prospecting or the
[01:03:00] follow-ups. Okay, that's my problem. And I have an hour a day to do this. So I need an hour and a half.
[01:03:09] Give me suggestions as a real estate recruiting recruiter REALTOR recruiting coach as a productivity
[01:03:18] coach as a time management expert as a as another as somebody who yeah, those are good. Those are
[01:03:28] ones. I just do those. Then critique the ideas. Now critique your own ideas. So chat GP gives me
[01:03:35] answers. Okay, are these good answers or should we keep trying and then keep refining it?
[01:03:44] Okay, so if I imagine some of us can relate to that particular issue, making our calls. By the way,
[01:03:52] if you struggle with making your calls, you are not alone. Like, almost every agent I talk to
[01:03:57] you struggles to make their dials or whatever that version is for you. So, you know, don't worry,
[01:04:02] you're not alone. That's why it's good to have an accountability partner because you'll be like,
[01:04:05] oh, you have the same problems I do. Cool. Or at least similar problems. What about
[01:04:11] what about time management because you have other responsibilities, family? Or how about this?
[01:04:17] Let's give a different one. What about clients that text you in the evening and you're like,
[01:04:21] I don't know what to do. Do I reply? It's 9 p.m. Like, I don't, do I want to train this person
[01:04:27] message me at any time of the night? I'm not saying you shouldn't. I'm saying you have to think about
[01:04:31] that, right? Like, maybe you're cool with that? Maybe you're not. So, is this a problem we can,
[01:04:36] some of our clients are, you know, just say, well, I'm going to text you at 10 because that's what I do.
[01:04:41] And then maybe they have an expectation that you get back to them. Maybe they don't. I don't know.
[01:04:45] But this is a thing, right? Especially text because text communication doesn't end. Just goes on
[01:04:50] and on. So there's no start and end, right? So, has any, by the way, is this a problem people have?
[01:04:56] Okay, who solved this problem? Okay, let's solve it for you. How do you solve it?
[01:05:11] Yeah.
[01:05:22] Yeah. Great. And, right. And do you get pushback on that? Okay. And how do you handle the pushback?
[01:05:35] You're there. Love it. Who would say, who would think that's a pretty good answer?
[01:05:40] But do you need to say it upfront?
[01:05:44] The key. Yeah. Yeah. And what do clients do? They push boundaries sometimes, don't they?
[01:05:52] You have to stick just like children, right? Just like family, right?
[01:05:55] I think that's a thing that's a little bit more important than I think.
[01:06:07] Brilliant. You're not even going to see it.
[01:06:11] Yes. Yeah. Awesome. Does anyone ever give you a headache about that?
[01:06:21] There you go. Pretty cool. So, that's a great, those are both great, great suggestions.
[01:06:29] Okay, one of their challenges are people having. Let's make this a problem solving session.
[01:06:33] What else?
[01:06:35] Ooh, that's a good one. Okay, who solved that?
[01:06:41] Bookkeeper. Okay, bookkeeper. Acting as a bookkeeper. How would you solve an expense tracking problem?
[01:06:48] I think so.
[01:06:51] Oh, you're not a bookkeeper. You pay a bookkeeper. Okay, okay. So, who has solved it?
[01:06:55] Which is great. That's a great suggestion. Who has solved that on their own?
[01:07:00] Okay, how do you solve that? Okay.
[01:07:07] What's the name of the app? Everlands, right? That's down. That's a great one. Love it.
[01:07:15] I love that. Yeah, expense tracking. That's a tough one. I still funny enough. I still have to do my taxes for this year.
[01:07:21] I think I have a few days left. My account is about ready to kill me.
[01:07:26] Oh, it's October. Okay. Okay. Well, I'm an S-Corp, so I don't know if that's different, but September.
[01:07:32] September. Yeah, I'm September. Yeah, I'm September. Yeah, so thank you. Thank you.
[01:07:38] Yeah, so I'm in crunch mode for that. And so I've been putting that off. I've been
[01:07:43] dilly-dallying on that all year. So silly. I got to get that done this weekend.
[01:07:50] All right, what other challenges? That's expense tracking. What about prospecting?
[01:07:55] Who's having prospecting challenges? Everybody? Or not everybody? A lot of us.
[01:07:59] Okay, what are the challenges? What challenge are you having?
[01:08:05] Well, you raised your hand. A conversation about real estate with strangers.
[01:08:18] So where do you meet these people? Okay, who goes to networking events?
[01:08:24] Okay, how do you talk about real estate? Who's got an answer for?
[01:08:32] Okay, okay. Why? Why don't you talk about real estate?
[01:08:40] I'm not saying you should. I'm just asking. I'm just genuinely curious. Yeah,
[01:08:46] because you don't want to talk about yourself. You want to just learn about them? Ah,
[01:08:50] pretty good. And what does that do when somebody asks you a lot of questions about you?
[01:08:55] What does that do to the relationship?
[01:09:01] I don't care. No. Yeah. Yeah. So take the pressure off yourself. You're not, you don't have to
[01:09:08] present, right? Or some people would suggest you just have to say, how can I help you?
[01:09:13] Or what do you, what are you, what are you into? So yeah, I'm totally get that. I present.
[01:09:19] Nobody wants to hear my me pitch about my firm. They do not. Does anyone want that recruiting call?
[01:09:25] Unless you were like looking for a firm, do you want those recruiting calls? Probably not.
[01:09:28] You want somebody to be like, do you have a problem? I can help you solve it. And then
[01:09:31] you can always check out my firm on your own. I mean, people are resourceful. They can look
[01:09:35] up your website. I don't need you. They can find homes on their own. They don't need you for that.
[01:09:39] They need you to help them through the process. But learning about them, great answer. What a great
[01:09:43] suggestion. Is that helpful? Yeah, just have a lot of questions. People will eventually be like,
[01:09:49] what do you do? Oh, I don't know.
[01:10:20] like sure
[01:10:28] I don't.
[01:10:29] But I think what you have to get me a word
[01:10:32] and conversation starter, like,
[01:10:34] you have to.
[01:10:36] And by the way, is there somebody in the room
[01:10:38] that when she said I've shown somebody 50 houses goes,
[01:10:40] I would never ever show somebody 50 houses?
[01:10:44] I'm not judging it.
[01:10:45] I'm not judging it.
[01:10:45] I'm saying, are there people that have solved?
[01:10:48] Are there people that have solved that problem?
[01:10:50] Yeah, yes.
[01:10:51] Yes.
[01:10:52] OK.
[01:10:52] Is there anyone who's going to be on the view?
[01:10:54] Well, or the expectation can be,
[01:10:58] the expectation can be adjusted.
[01:10:59] Or my point is, there's a solution.
[01:11:02] Somebody has solved this problem.
[01:11:05] And by the way, maybe you should show them 50 homes.
[01:11:07] I don't know.
[01:11:08] I'm just saying she said it was a problem.
[01:11:10] So I'm not judging it.
[01:11:12] You guys are the experts.
[01:11:14] That's a great one.
[01:11:15] And by the way, yes, everyone has gone through that.
[01:11:17] Everyone has done that.
[01:11:19] Everyone has done that.
[01:11:19] If you're on the way to get your money,
[01:11:21] put that one behind and put it.
[01:11:22] Yeah, it's tough to.
[01:11:23] You get a lesson next person about your car.
[01:11:26] But she can hold on to the car.
[01:11:27] And when they're very close, maybe.
[01:11:32] Letting clients go is a very empowering thing I hear
[01:11:35] from what people tell me.
[01:11:36] It's very empowering.
[01:11:38] There's a lot of them.
[01:11:40] What else?
[01:11:41] So that's a great one.
[01:11:42] That's a, by the way, thank you for that sharing that.
[01:11:43] That's really awesome.
[01:11:45] Let's give one more.
[01:11:46] And then we'll just work.
[01:11:49] Work life balance.
[01:11:53] OK, who has some suggestions around?
[01:11:56] Are you talking about personal life and professional life?
[01:12:01] Work life.
[01:12:02] OK, so some of us are parents.
[01:12:04] Some of us are single probably or in relationships.
[01:12:07] Some of them have kids.
[01:12:08] Some of us don't.
[01:12:08] Some of us have other responsibilities work-wise.
[01:12:11] Who has some good suggestions for people who have other stuff
[01:12:14] going on?
[01:12:14] Go ahead.
[01:12:15] You're never going to have some kind of experience.
[01:12:21] You're never going to have some kind of experience.
[01:12:23] You're never going to have some kind of experience.
[01:12:28] Ooh, that's good.
[01:12:37] Yeah, do people in our lives know when we're present?
[01:12:39] Do they know when we're on our phones?
[01:12:42] They do.
[01:12:43] They do.
[01:12:45] So that's great.
[01:12:46] And yeah, balances.
[01:12:48] I'm not a big believer in the word balance.
[01:12:50] I just have never found it personally.
[01:12:52] So good luck.
[01:12:54] If you find it, let me know.
[01:12:56] But there are adjustments that can be made.
[01:12:59] And it's understanding to what are the problems.
[01:13:02] That's how you solve balance.
[01:13:04] I'll never fully be solved.
[01:13:05] Because once you solve one problem, another one pops up.
[01:13:08] But that's just life, right?
[01:13:09] So it's not about getting rid of the problems.
[01:13:12] It's just about knowing, OK, I've got
[01:13:13] this problem now.
[01:13:14] How do I solve it?
[01:13:15] Ask chat, GPT for help, or ask lovely people in this room.
[01:13:18] How helpful is everyone being, by the way?
[01:13:20] Isn't this great?
[01:13:21] Isn't it so lonely sometimes when we work at home
[01:13:24] and we don't have direct access to people?
[01:13:27] Maybe we don't go into an office?
[01:13:29] Nobody ever comes into our office.
[01:13:30] So yeah, so this is so cool.
[01:13:32] Use people, not only use them in a useful way, right?
[01:13:37] Be of service to them.
[01:13:39] These people are dying to give you health, right?
[01:13:41] So I'm sorry.
[01:13:41] Go ahead.
[01:13:42] I did how you ask me that with fourth-eyed exams,
[01:13:46] I feel like, I mean Dr. Nd Moreieu has read today's
[01:13:49] knockout final exam.
[01:13:53] Do you have apps these lower thanих undergraduate maths?
[01:13:58] Yes, I do.
[01:14:04] So if this was a lookeduan,
[01:14:07] I would condemn cases like students and cr!​
[01:14:17] Yeah.
[01:14:18] Yeah.
[01:14:19] I might talk to you in the morning, and you know, Robin, so you're right, I can be in the
[01:14:23] full volume too.
[01:14:24] So, right.
[01:14:25] As you should focus on when you're asking questions.
[01:14:30] How you are going to deal with an answer that is actually that's just, and you have the
[01:14:36] breath, but why are you not asking questions?
[01:14:39] Well, then the answer is, for your answer, I'm going to ask you, for your answer,
[01:14:42] 
[01:14:42] 
[01:14:42] 
[01:14:42] 
[01:14:44] or we would call that Copa Head, right?
[01:14:47] Like, I'm about to walk into this thing.
[01:14:49] Copa Head.
[01:14:50] Yeah.
[01:14:51] Copa Head.
[01:14:52] You know, it's a good idea.
[01:14:54] It really helps when things go a different way than you expect.
[01:14:57] So, before that, expect, maybe they will go that way.
[01:14:59] Was that the Cal Newport?
[01:15:02] By the way, who's a Mel Robbins fan?
[01:15:05] Isn't she great?
[01:15:06] Well, thank goodness for her, right?
[01:15:09] So, yeah, she just had on Cal Newport, who is a really, he's a time management guy, and
[01:15:15] a productivity guy, and he's all about slowing down productivity, doing less.
[01:15:20] And he's like a, he's a professor at, I forget where, but he's like big deal.
[01:15:24] He's like, he's like, he's a data scientist, and he's awesome.
[01:15:28] So, yeah, check out the, check out Mel Robbins, if you, that's a great, great podcast for, in my opinion.
[01:15:33] Okay, let's go one more.
[01:15:35] What, once one more challenge we're having?
[01:15:38] What about other agents?
[01:15:41] Any challenges with other agents?
[01:15:48] Hey, I live there, man, I can, I know.
[01:15:54] I know.
[01:15:55] Unfriendly agents, maybe.
[01:15:56] Some unfriendly people.
[01:15:58] But, okay, but how about getting somebody to call you back when you have a question about their listing?
[01:16:04] Feedback.
[01:16:05] 
[01:16:05] The question is, if the people are getting, you know, either blind or blind, but they're back.
[01:16:12] Oh.
[01:16:15] So, how do we get, how can we get feedback in a way that's not going to get you sued?
[01:16:21] I'm going to have to be, not for that.
[01:16:28] Okay.
[01:16:29] Oh.
[01:16:34] Now,
[01:16:35] the conditions for these folks instead of,
[01:16:39] so, yes, you want to get somebody to, you get a doctor's knowing time conflict to ask questions, you want something.
[01:16:48] So, you can say, I'm not looking for your virus, you got to, I wonder if you can.
[01:16:51] Great suggestion.
[01:16:53] Now, what about when we call agents to get feedback and they don't return the call?
[01:16:57] How might we, well, that's true, too?
[01:17:03] Well, yeah, okay.
[01:17:05] Yeah.
[01:17:06] So, so, so, what do you do in the, so what do you do?
[01:17:09] You text message.
[01:17:15] There you go.
[01:17:16] Or you just say, can I do it via text?
[01:17:19] Yeah.
[01:17:21] What do you think of the property?
[01:17:24] Who would much rather respond to a text message than a call?
[01:17:28] A lot of people.
[01:17:29] A lot of, not everyone, but some people.
[01:17:32] That's a great suggestion.
[01:17:34] I love that.
[01:17:38] Oh.
[01:17:41] Oh.
[01:17:42] So, that's a good one.
[01:18:01] Cool.
[01:18:02] Alright guys, we are, we did a lot today.
[01:18:05] Let's all congratulate ourselves.
[01:18:07] We'll look at us helping each other.
[01:18:07] Cool!

And now, onto our show. Today's episode is brought to you by corded.io. Are you looking for agents to join your brokerage or team? Now, as a real estate recruiter, I can tell you the answer is always yes. But most agents aren't looking to move right now. So how do you know who to contact? Well, what if I were to tell you there's a recruiting and retention tool powered by artificial intelligence that shows you exactly which agents in your local market are looking to leave their brokerage right now and which agents at your own firm are also looking to leave you? Now, I've been recruiting REALTORS for 15 years and I've hired over 2,000 agents. I can tell you with no exaggeration, this is the tool I've been waiting for. Corded's AI looks for trends across dozens of variables for each agent in your market and shows you which agents they believe are likely to move. Not only does it do that, but corded's AI went and visited my recruiting website and read everything I offer. So now when I'm recruiting, corded's AI tells me exactly what to say based on that agent's needs and what my brokerage can offer. It even writes emails for me. I've never seen anything like it and I use it every single day. Now, if you are looking to grow your brokerage, corded.io is the best tool out there. Visit corded.io to schedule a demo again. That's corded.io. And now, onto the show. Hello and welcome to another episode of Keeping It Real, the largest podcast made by real estate agents and four real estate agents. My name is DJ Paris. I'm your guide and host through the show. Today, I'm the guest. Well, I'm not actually the guest, but what I am going to share with you is a webinar or rather a seminar that I did for the Women's Council of REALTORS here in the Chicago Land area, specifically talking about how top 1% agents utilize chat GPT and specifically how they craft their queries. So we may be using chat GPT to write or ask for things like help with our listing presentation or maybe some social media post ideas, but there are ways you can super charge those questions. And I provide the framework for exactly how to do that in a five step process. It's super easy to understand, but you may have not heard this before. So this is the best way to think about how do I interact with chat GPT and I promise by listening to this, you're going to get great results going forward with your AI searches. Now, just as a point to mention, there's going to be a few times during this presentation where somebody from the audience will ask a question. You might not hear the question. I apologize for that. I will be giving the answer. So you'll probably be able to tell what that is, but the vast majority of the time I am presenting without any questions. And there's a PDF to go along with this that is a companion piece, which will be in the show notes. So please check that out as well. You can download that and use it. But just what I want you to do is really just listen to sort of understand the framework. And from here, I promise you'll get so much value out of it. It's so grateful for the women's council of REALTORS to having me. And this was a lot of fun for me. And I'll probably do more of these into the future. By the way, I do a series, a video series short form video about three times a week on all of the social channels for keeping it real. So anywhere you can find us, YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, TikTok, and probably other places where I show 60 second clips of exactly some queries that top agents are using. I give you the query. I explain why it's effective. And then you can go out and use it today. So if you're not already following me on the different social channels or on YouTube, please do so so you can get those 60 second tips. We do not post those here. So they're only on social channels and on YouTube. So please check that out. I would appreciate it and give me your feedback. Let me know what queries you would like me to craft for you. And I'll give those to you. And I love making those videos. So anyway, all right, big and true. I appreciate that. Thank you to all the new listeners, all the returning listeners. Thank you to our sponsors. And let's get to it. My conversation, well with me, about AI and how top agents are using it. Thank you. I don't want to follow that. That was really, really great. So I have a big shoes to follow. So thank you, Jennifer. Thank you, Hartland for having me come out. Thank you, Women's Council of REALTORS. I'm a huge fan of WCR. I'm a member of the Chicago chapter. And a cement aren't smart enough to have our own group. But you women are very smart to do this because I think we all need support and help. And WCR is if nothing else is support organization for their members. And obviously they do a lot of good in the community too. But boy, what a great thing. I've had definitely, I believe, I'd have to look. But I think I've had some national WCR people on my show if I haven't. I need to. I've certainly reached out to them. So if anyone does have connections with their national people, let me know. And I'll get them on. And so yeah, a little bit about me. I am a, well, I podcast as more of a hobby. It's a fun thing I do. I have a day job, which I'll be doing right after this, where I work for the company called Kale Realty, where brokerage in the city. We have about 700 agents. I've been there for gosh, 14 years when back when we just had a couple of agents. So it's been fun to grow that business and half our brokers live in the suburbs. So this is not a foreign to me to be, although I don't get to go out to the suburbs. I live in the city. So I'm not out here very much. But I'm grateful to be here and excited to speak with everyone today. Also have the podcast. So, oh, and what do I do at Kale? I'm an agent, but I don't practice. So don't ask me real estate questions because I'll be the, you'll know more than me. But, which is funny because I have this podcast, which is fairly popular for real estate agents. And, you know, again, people ask me questions and I just try to say, oh, you know, I ask, I ask the experts, but I do have access to a lot of experts. So that's what we'll talk about a little bit today is what are the top agents doing in AI. But what do I do during the day is I recruit agents. I don't worry. I'm not going to try to recruit anyone here, but that's what I do all day. So I sit at a desk and I do support also for our 700 agents. So I hear a lot about the questions and challenges REALTORS have as well as talking to top agents all over the country. So I've done about 700 episodes. My podcast is also, it's called Keeping It Real. I wish I would have renamed it because there's about five other podcasts also called Keeping It Real. So that was, you know, maybe a tactical error seven years ago. But we have over, yeah, 700 episodes or so, I think. And we put out a few episodes a week. I talked to the top agents in the country and just say, how'd you do that? How'd you grow your business? I thought it was just a smart thing to do because back when we, when I started, we didn't have much training at our firm. We have, we have that now. But back then we didn't. I thought, well, if I collected the stories from the top agents, that'd probably be pretty good for our agents. And then I just thought, I'll just, you know, put it out there for everyone. And so it's been a lot of fun. And I really appreciate anyone who's a listener and check it out, see if you like it. And if you do tell someone else about it, that would also help. But we have sponsors and it's really fun. I have a whole team that works on it now and it's just really fun to do. So my boss is nice enough to let me do it. So that is, that is why I'm here today is really too. We, we actually, at our firm, we've tried to, we just launched an AI chatbot for our agents because we want to cut down to the support questions. Not that we don't love supporting our agents. We have a lot of them and we don't have, you know, we only have seven of us in our support team. So we have to make sure that, you know, we have access to information when we're sleeping and we're not around, you know, pick up the phone and answer those calls. So we created a little AI chatbot of our own. So we're really AI forward at our, at our company. It's really fun. It's really hard to develop an AI chat. That's knows everything our support team knows. So we're actually learning this along the way too. But this is going to be coming. If your brokerage doesn't have that, it will, you know, everyone's going to have an AI chatbot. You probably already are using chat, GPT or Google Gemini or GROC or Clawed or any of those other AI systems. So if you haven't, don't worry. We're going to get you through it. But what I really want to talk about today is just how to utilize chat GPT. And I'm going to give you all sorts of suggestions about how you could use it in your business. And I can give you prompts. I have prompts in this PDF. This PDF, by the way, will be emailed to you, excited to Jennifer. She can distribute it. I'm recording this as well. So don't worry if you miss anything. We'll have the recording. You guys can download it. I'll probably make, make it even a podcast episode. So you can all be part of my podcast audience. I appreciate that. And don't worry though, you're not in camera. It's just me. And then you'll be able to watch this back. So don't worry if you miss something. What I really want to impart today, and this is part of our journey when we were building our chatbot, which took us months at our firm. I mean, you think it'd be pretty simple. We have a website that's for our agents. And it has hundreds of questions and support stuff because we were smart enough to do that like 10 years ago. And then we thought, OK, well, we're just going to have it read everything. And then we'll just know what to say. We found that, oh, it's a lot more than that. And so when we were building ours, again, we just thought it'd be so easy. And it wasn't. And we had to learn how to teach the AI what we wanted it to tell our agents. And so I'm going to sort of teach to you some of the learnings we have taken over that time. And also I talked to top agents all over the country, and I asked them, how do you use AI? So that's all we're going to do. I really, my intention today is really to teach you how to communicate with AI. Not to necessarily say these are the best prompts. I give you a bunch of examples of good prompts, I think. But you're going to be able to craft your own when we're done with here. Because if is everyone not ever, I shouldn't say it, how many people have utilized like chat CBT or one of the, OK, seems like most everyone. OK, if you haven't, don't worry. Super easy. It's free, by the way. Although I do recommend pay for the premium version. It's like, what is it? 20 bucks a month? 20, like it's the best 20 bucks you'll ever spend. Like it is way better. Like cancel your HBO max, which is like, I think I pay 25 a month for that. I love that. But this is this is going to help you more. So, you know, if you're strapped for cash, beg borrower steel, get that $20 because it will really, really help you. But the free version is good too. But the nice part about the paid version is it can just do more things. It can remember things and you really want it to really get a sense of who you are along the way and it figures that out too. So anyway, that's my little pitch for chat CBT. But, you know, you can use other ones. Jim Gemini is good. They're all really good. It's just pick one you like. So I'm going to talk specifically about how I use chat CBT because that's the one I use. But they all pretty much work very similarly. And what I want to really share with you is how to best approach getting a good result. Because, you know, I used to just type in things like, you know, I would think about, okay, what's a good prompt for an agent? And I would think, okay, give me 10 social media post ideas, right? Which, you know, seem like a decent idea. You know, and I would say, oh, you know, I'm a REALTOR. Give me 10 social media post ideas for content. Or maybe you throw a listing in a listing description, right? And say, rewrite this. Write this in a better way. We probably all tried some version of that. And we get varying results, right? Sometimes it's a wonderful, like exactly what I'm looking for. And other times it's like, you know, it's more general. I know I used to be frustrated when we, remember pre AI, we would go online and look for like, what's, you know, what are 10 good marketing ideas as a REALTOR I should do today? And you'd find these lists of top 10 things to do. And mostly they're really generic. And most list if you guys noticed that, you know, the website lists are not typically that great. And so I wanted to sort of get past that with, because AI is trained on stuff like that. So you have to actually really teach it exactly what you're looking for. And the good news is it's pretty easy. Once you sort of think the framework, once you understand the framework and sort of just think it through a little bit, it'll make your results much, much better. And, you know, I'm going to show you how to, how I do that and how I recommend doing that. And then I, I threw in my ideas into chat GVT and said, are these accurate, right? Because I wanted to make sure that chat GVT agree that these are great ways to get better results. So I'm even using chat GVT to help with this presentation. So let's get started. I'm going to get you this PDF. So don't worry about, if you can't see it, I'm just going to be talking through it. There's, you know, it's really not that much to look at at the moment. But I'll certainly give you the, the gist of it. And I really, I think we should start with, how do you best think about approaching AI? Think of it as the, sorry, the way I think of it, I'm not going to tell you how to think about it. But the way I think about it is more of a consultant. Has anyone ever worked in consultancy or has anyone have the consultant in their family? If you have, you typically know what they do, which is, it's always a little, you know, I never quite understand what a consultant really does. But I understand the process, which is they go into a business or they, you know, they have a client who has a problem. And then they go in and say, all right, or I'll give you a better example. You go to the doctor, right? You have some sort of reason you're going to see the doctor. And before you just go, I got this problem and I need a solution. They're like, whoa, whoa, whoa, fill out these 200 questions about your, you know, your health history because it's really important that we know exactly what your health has been over the last, you know, your entire life. And we need to know what happened with your family and all that stuff, because that might influence might as what I, you know, recommend as a solution for your health issue, right? Consultants do the same thing. So, so we're going to sort of think of it as AI is not just a search engine. And, and it's way more than that. And if you can get really dialed in to exactly what you need. And if you think about who should be answering the question, not letting chat GPT just decide, here's how I think it should answer the question for my query, my question is I'm going to tell it exactly the type of person that would be best suited to answer this question. So, I'll say that again. So, if I was, if I had a, you know, injury with my brain, right, I wouldn't go to a general practitioner. I'd be like, I better go to a neurologist or I better go to a neurosurgeon or I better find out who's the specialist who handles, you know, my particular brain issue, right? So, we're going to think about it as chat GPT and its essence is just a general practitioner, which is great. You can give you all sorts of good ideas. But if you really want dialed in ideas, you want it going to want to go to a little bit of a higher level in specialty, which means you got to tell it that. And over time, if you have the paid version, it'll sort of learn kind of who you are and what you need. So, you don't always have to do this, but you'll have to do it initially, right? So, let's think about what, let's, hey, let's actually make this really interactive. So, let's just think about right now, just think of what's the, doesn't have to be the biggest challenge because biggest challenge might be hard to figure out. But what's one challenge that any of you are experiencing right now in your business, just yell out one challenge? Oh, you have challenges. I promise. What does that mean? So, listings are staying on the market for longer. Yes, that's a national thing, by the way, if you guys haven't been reading about that. So, problem. Listings are staying on the market for longer. What does that basically mean, by the way? Rises are too high, right? That's the answer. Now, that doesn't mean it's an easy answer and it doesn't mean, okay, well, my clients are just going to have to deal with that because obviously they might have to or they might not, that's your decision. But that's what it means, essentially, right? Okay, so, that's the problem. The problem is my listings aren't selling. I'm not getting action on my listings. Is that what I'm hearing? Is that accurate? Fair enough. Okay, is there a lot of people experiencing this? Yes, okay. So, how might we think about chat GBT to solve this problem? Now, by the way, it might not be able to solve this problem. But we're going to give it a shot. I'm not going to feed in. I'm not going to get a result from this. I'm just going to teach you how to think about getting a result. So, if we were to think who would know of what type of expert or what type of individual would be really a great resource if you had them in your office and you had somebody who was like, oh, that's not a problem for me. What would be that kind of person's characteristics? So, let's think about that. Who would know how to solve that problem? It's a tough question. But let's think about it. Maybe top producer, somebody who's maybe going to MRED and look for who's beating the market time, who's selling things within seven days as opposed to 20 days. Maybe somebody like that. So, we would want to look for an agent who is producing and selling homes is more quickly than what the market is currently averaging. Does that make sense? Now, we don't know who that person is and we don't know what skills they have, but we know that they can do that. That's all we need to know. So, the first step is for us to define the role of who's going to solve this problem. Now, again, this sounds sort of like, okay, I guess, but this is how it works. So, you have to think about who's the person that can best solve this problem. I'll give you an example. I was coming into Crystal Lake last night. I'm not familiar with Crystal Lake. I mean, I know about it, but I don't know like, I was hungry and I needed to eat something and I'm like, I don't know what the good restaurants are out here. So, at first, I just thought best restaurants in Crystal Lake, and that's all I typed in. And it gave me a bunch of ideas. And I thought, well, best, according to who, like, who's determining what's best? Like, people have different tastes, people have different budgets, people have different. Some people, you know, eat fancy, other people eat more, you know, casual, like, everyone's different. It doesn't know what I want. And then I thought, well, I guess I could tell it what I want, but like, I don't really care. It could be fancy or it could be inexpensive. I just want good. And I thought, okay, well, who would know what the best restaurants are? Or at least, who might know? You know, and I thought, well, a food critic would probably know, right? If I trusted that, the food critic was good, but I, you know, I figured that was a good idea. So, I typed in, imagine your food critic, expert food critic, and you write a column for the, you know, your paper and your, or on TV. What would you recommend as the three best restaurants to eat that are open right now, because I was coming in late, and it gave me three ideas. I won't say what they are, because I don't, I don't have any stake in this, it doesn't matter. But that, that actually gave me different response results. And then it even explained to me why as a food critic, it would recommend, and these were not, I thought they'd give me like the fanciest places, and I was like, I don't really want to do that, but it didn't. It gave me like, really approachable places. And I could have refined it further, and I said, well, I really want to eat more upscale, or I want to, I want to have more casual experience. I could have done that, but it just gave me three relief, like, simple good ideas. I was like, okay, cool. And that's what I selected for. So really, really easy, right? So we want to think about who can best solve this problem. Now, the problem is real. Homes aren't selling as quickly. We're dealing with this in the city. The suburbs are certainly dealing with it. Nationwide, I think the average time on market is now up to, oh gosh, does anyone know, is it 40 days? It used to be 26. So this is not a problem that is unique to hear, and it is a problem. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So it's all, you know, and again, I might have those numbers wrong, but, but the point is, is that this is a problem, and your clients are going to be upset if they're not getting action on their property, and you have promised them that you will get them action, right? Or if you've suggested they will, because you're going to have to have a pretty hard conversation with them about pricing, or taking it off the market, maybe, right? So, or, or, or, or making improvements, or whatever, whatever the solution is. So the first step is in this problem to think, okay, who could best solve it, right? Who's the role of the person that could best solve it? And if I, the more specific I could get, so for, I would write something like, acting as a top 1% listing agent who is able to have their proper, their listing sold, you know, 50% quicker than the average REALTOR in my area in Crystal Lake, right? I would even, or whatever area you might be, you know, this listing might be in. I would even get that specific, because it can even start to look at that data. I was thinking of moving out to Oak Park recently. First thing I did, I thought I should probably learn like what the market is really like in Oak Park, and I could study MRED, but I don't, I, I want to talk to an expert. So I said, give me the agents who have sold the most homes in Oak Park in the last year, and you know, I could do that on MRED too, but Chatshipiti did faster. Then I called those, those Oak Park agents and I said, hey, I'm not going to use you because I'm an agent, but like, I would really love if you had any tips for me. And by the way, aren't REALTOR so generous with information? Like, they had no real reason to help me, although, you know, they have listings and maybe, you know, they'd consider me for a listing to tell me about it maybe before it's the market. I don't know, but they were just like, oh, you need to do this, this, and this. So like, I'm, I did a version of this in real life. I just asked those three people, and they had no reason to want to help me. And technically, I'm competition, but, you know, people are pretty nice, right? So we want to think about that, who could best solve this problem, or what type of person could solve this problem, and what characteristics would they have? So I would start there. So now, is this going to give you a magic bullet answer? Like, oh, you just have to do this one thing, probably not, but it'll give you a better better probability of giving a good answer. Does this make sense? Yes. Okay. Let's do one more, just to have fun. Think of one other issue that somebody is having that is, you know, making your life just a little bit more difficult right now. Oh, well, we have a guaranteed rate person here. So, uh, so he gets that question all day long. Uh, by the way, rates are to 10 all year low, right? So like, but people are still like, they're not 3% and everyone who has a 3% rate is, why would I sell? Right? Like, I'm a get, I have to sell it to three. I have to give up my 3% rate here. Certainly, I'm not happy about it, but oh, well, such as life. Um, and so I get it. That's a real problem, right? It was like 85% of the country has less than like a 4% or I, guaranteed rate, a gentleman can, can give you the stats on that, but like, it's tough. Like, getting people to want to move. That's a rough one. Uh, I have to. So, uh, you know, for a life event. So it makes sense for me, but certainly not something I'm happy about, but that's a problem. So that's a great one. So I would say acting as a, I might start with a top loan consultant, a low, an originator, a mortgage lender. I might start there and say, what would a lender, what would a top lender say is a reason to consider selling your property if you're looking for listing, uh, even though you might have a 3% mortgage, right? And, and by the way, are there reasons to consider giving up, even if you don't have to move, is there, are there any good arguments to be made to give up your property at a 3% current rate for a 6 or 7% rate? There are. Right? Maybe they're not compelling to the person you'll be sharing that way. There maybe they won't want to do it, but is there an answer to that? There is. Um, and it makes sense and I, it makes sense in my situation. Number one, I don't want to compete with everybody when the rates come down, because what's that going to do to pricing? It's going to shoot it up and, and, and our, our friend at guaranteed rate will tell you, you date the rate, you marry the home, right? So, you know, you get, yeah, it sucks and nobody wants to pay, uh, let borrow money at twice the expense it was, you know, years ago, but oh well. So I'd rather not compete with all these buyers, personally, but is that a hard psychological barrier to get over? Sure. That's a tough one. So again, I might throw into chat GBT. What might I say? If I were a lending top loan officer who does, you know, uh, have a lot of clients that currently have a 3% rate and is able to, um, you know, convince them to consider maybe giving that up or if they're a first time home buyer, why might they consider taking this rate? First time home buyers don't typically care that much, right? But, but certainly people who own a home do. So that's something that to think put that in acting as a top loan officer or acting as an agent that is getting, uh, working with lots of buyers right now. What might the top agent? What might they be saying to, now you don't have to answer that chat GBT or answer that. So if you write this out and get really specific about who's answering the question, you will get some pretty cool answers. Is anyone tried this approach? Yeah, and it works, right? Mm hmm. Mm hmm. And I was like, I'm afraid I, you know, it's like, it's really because it's close to you telling us that our, you find and get like, rolled down. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So that's like, other than it, it starts to get familiar. It would tell you what you're not flexible. Yeah. And by the way, if you don't get a good result, you can just write in, you know, um, this is a pretty general, you know, I need more specific advice. Or can you find five other, maybe, uh, suggestions, right? You could just keep asking questions. So we're going to number one, define, role and context. So we're going to define who can answer this and what characteristics might they have? Okay. So in and of itself, if that's all you ever did with your queries, this will dramatically improve the results. Like that's like the most important thing. Again, acting as a top food critic, whatever that even means, right? But it gave me, and then it gave me back to the food critic one, it gave me its, um, it's reasoning for why a food critic would like this particular place. So I was like, oh, that's pretty cool. Now I don't, you know, who knows? Maybe it just picked three at random. I don't know. But at least I, I think it was helpful. It was better than I could have done on my own. Number two is specify the business goal. So not just like I have this problem where buyers are waiting for rates to come down, or they're sitting on the fence, or listings are sitting on the market. What are we, what are we trying to accomplish? We're trying to get buyers off the fence. We're trying to get people to understand that now might be a good time to consider buying because not as much competition and, you know, maybe it'd be better to do it now than later. Who knows? I don't know. You guys are the market experts. You know, you know, the answers to those questions. But certainly there's people that are getting doing business right now despite those challenges. So when you get the goal, the goal is what? I want more listings. I want more buyers off the fence. I want the best restaurants here in the area. Right? So we want to get very specific about not just I want 10 social media post ideas. I want 10 social media post ideas that will encourage people to consider buying even though they might think it's not a great time to buy. Okay. So make sense? Cool. So you're going to get all this by the way. So don't worry about writing it down if you feel free to, but I'm going to go through it fairly quickly. And yeah. So just making sure I covered everything. Yeah. That looks good. Okay. Let's move on to so we're going to give it who's going to answer this and what's our goal? What are we trying and the more specific you get the better with your goal? So it's like I want to lose weight. Okay. How much? Do you want to lose weight or do you want to lose fat? Do you want to burn muscle? Probably not. Do you want to lose fat? Probably. Right? So I hear this all the time. It's like I lost 20 pounds. Right? People we talk we talk like this because we look at the number on the scale. It's like what does that mean? It doesn't it might be really bad to lose 20 pounds because if you're losing muscle that is really bad. Right? So it's like we want to get specific. How do I burn more fat? How do I build more muscle? You know, how do I, you know, that kind of thing? So okay. We're going to also give it some constraints and boundaries because we want to make sure, you know, it's it's like a child. You have to tell it you can you can do this and not that, right? These are the boundaries that you play play in. So it needs to make sure that it aligns with who you are and and what you're capable of, right? If you're a part-time agent and it's like I need you to, you know, go on Facebook four hours a day and do research on every one of your prospects and then comment on every one of their posts like well, that's probably not realistic, right? For somebody who's maybe it's realistic for for some of us, but other of us have other we have families we have other things going on we have other responsibilities and and you know, we're not going to be able to do that and that's going to give us a result where like I don't care I can't do that. So we want to give it very specific instructions about how much time I have to do these tasks, right? If it's a you're asking for a solution to a task, you know, how can I do this very how can do this quickly? Maybe I, how can I do all my social media, you know, posting or what what I call research and developments? By the way, if you're not using social media just as a side for research and development, like I don't do any great content, let's like do this, there's a great idea, like that's great. If you're just like, I just sold home, you know, look at me, like, okay, you know, fine, but but what you really want to think about is how do I learn about people on social media, right? Social media is a great place to know what's going on in here. We were just talking about somebody here works at a firm at a friend of mine owns and he pays attention to what his agents do in their personal life because he follows them on social. What do you think that does for the people at his office? They think that's probably pretty cool, right? They're like, wow, you know, it's going on in my life. Yeah, he follows you on social. He makes it a point to do that, right? So I just my little plug for you social to learn about people so that you can call them up and go like, I just saw you went on a vacation. I like, maybe it's not always fun to go, are you ready to buy and sell a home, right? But you could call it, see, you just went to Cabo, like, tell me about it. Was it awesome? Like, maybe I should go. Would you recommend it? Right? Those are wonderful reasons to pick up the phone. So that's my little side thing. I'll get off that. But take that as a little bonus tip. And top agents do that, right? They develop relationships. They're kind of okay, I'll get off that. We're going to talk about boundaries. So we want to tell the AI agent, here's how much time I have. Here's what I'm capable of. So then it doesn't give me some unrealistic idea of what it thinks I should do if I had unlimited time because it might not know that you are a mother of a parent of three children. And by the way, you also work another job and you take care of elderly parents and you've got a million other things going on. So you got to make sure it knows what you're capable of as far as time and and your skill set and all of that. So here, I've got a few examples of that. Now, this is also really important, requesting multiple perspectives. So perspectives being who, you know, who else might be able to sort of see this from a different angle. You know, I always say, I, even though I'm technically in this business, I don't know that much about real estate truthfully. So when people ask me for like, how's the market doing? I'm like, oh, no, you don't want my answer on that because all I do is just regurgitate what I've heard from other people. I'm not there out there in the trenches. You need to talk to a practicing agent like they know what's going on, you know, they know in their market. There are boots on the ground. I'm like, I'm just the guy that reads, you know, reads articles. So, or I talk to top producers and I hear what they say, but they're out there doing it. So I would want to know things like as a top producer. So I do a, I do a video series. I just started this. I thought it was kind of fun. You can subscribe to it on any of my social channels, which is the keeping it real podcast. I run everywhere, TikTok, Facebook, Instagram, all that. So YouTube, LinkedIn, everywhere. So I started doing this. I just got a cool animation for it that I'm really excited about, but it's an AI agent minute. And it's basically giving you a prompt. I'm not what I think is a good idea. Here's an idea for an agent to consider using to help grow their business. And I give you the prompt and explain why I think it's a good idea. And you know, that's obviously all free. You can check that out. But what I do is to get to make sure it is a good idea for a good idea for agents who might be at a certain level of their production is I ask chat GBT, assume you are an agent of this production this many years in the business. Would this prompt idea that I'm going about to share in a video with this actually with this land with you? Like, is this something that my girlfriend's a trial attorney? So she deals with juries and she does civil cases. And juries are really important in civil cases because juries dictate how much money people get. Judges don't, which is really interesting. I didn't know this till I started dating her. And so a jury might think somebody should get $40 million, which by the way is insane to me, for whatever the reasoning is. But yeah, juries will be like, sure, that seems right. But so she'll ask me a lot of times, I'm going to give you this argument. What do you think about it? And I'm not, I'm just, you know, I don't know anything about the law. So she gets my perspective because she's like, she's too close to it, right? So sometimes we're a little too close to things, right? So we want to ask from a perspective of the person who were maybe trying to influence or the problem we're trying to solve, you know, let's remember not everyone knows about rates. Not everyone knows about, you know, time on market, right? But our buyers and sellers, they got their own lives. So as a person who doesn't really follow the market, how might they perceive the suggestion I'm about to give them? Right? She does this with chat, she'd be, too, where she throws in, I'm about to make this argument, to, here's, here's the type of jury member that we're probably going to have on the, on the stand. She throws this in and she goes, what do you think about this argument? Or she asks me, we do both. So we want to get through different perspectives. So again, give me three marketing ideas as if you're my branding coach. Wow, that's a great one. So Kim Ripper was mentioned by Jennifer. Kim Ripper comes on my show once a month. She's from Brooklyn. She's awesome. She's an ex-netflix executive and she's worked in, she, she set up us weekly's video division. So she's like, comes from that world. She's just like the coolest person. I love Kim and she's nice enough to come on my show once a month and say, here's how you do video. Anyway, a little plug for Kim. She's awesome. If you just subscribe to my show just for Kim's stuff, you'll get so much out of it. But anyway, Kim's a branding coach. That's what she teaches is like, here's how to, here's how to present yourself on video. So I might say as a video branding coach, I want to make this video where I'm seen as an expert around why, why people who have a 3% mortgage may want to consider looking at a property to, to buy and maybe sell their existing property, even though they might be getting this larger, you know, larger interest rate. Makes sense? Okay. So you want to get a lot of different ideas. So think about, and again, what we're really doing is we're thinking like a consultant, right? Consulments aren't necessarily experts at solving the problems that they go into solve. They're experts at figuring out who's what's the problem and what's the outcome and like who's the use case? Like how would we actually use it? And, and then they go out and find the experts to tell them what, you know, then they tell they oftentimes tell the client exactly what the experts say. Okay. And so multiple, sorry, multiple perspectives. And then last is role reversal and iteration. Okay. So what this just means is the first answer, sometimes it's the best answer, oftentimes, why not try again? See what you can get a couple other times. This sounds like a lot of work. It really isn't. Once you get the idea of this, you'll just constantly be chatting with chat GBT. And what's really cool about chat GBT and some of the other ones is you can just talk to it now. If it is anyone using the talk to feature, it's like having a conversation. By the way, pro tip here, if you are not practicing your objection handling or your listing presentation or your your phone calls, your client care calls, or I got to deliver some bad news to a client. If going to chat GBT and say, I need you to play the role of this particular person and you need to throw every objection you can at me, then I want you to judge my answers as, you know, put them on a scale of one to ten of whatever you want to do it. And, and then, you know, you can just go back and forth and keep refining it until chat GBT is like, that's a pretty good answer. I'm doing a I'm doing Compass. He's a he has a large team in the city. And Ben does this with all of his all of his team members. They all have chat GBT and they all practice. He goes, I used to have to coach every single one for these like role playing. He goes, we don't do that anymore. We just we train chat GBT. They actually even trained a model within chat GBT, exactly how he thinks those answers should go. He trained chat GBT and then his agent saw go into that chat GBT little language model and then they are trained from the it's like, I'm like, that's brilliant. Like that's so smart, right? So that's a great idea too. While you're driving around, ask chat GBT like, hey, quiz me a little bit. Like, imagine you're going to throw this objection at me or imagine you're going to say, you know, whatever, whatever challenges you guys experience out in the world, right? These are great things. I'm a recruiter. So I do this. I do it. I should do it more. But I should be doing this when people are like, why should I join your company? There's 200 other companies to join. It's like, that's true. That's a good question. And I better have an answer that's pretty compelling. And I've been doing this 14 years. I'm like, I got to still sharpen my skills there because there's some great firms out there that I compete with. And it's like, oh, yeah, there's some great ones. So I have to continue to sharpen my skills. So that's just my little pro tip there. But role reversal, right? So, here's great. It gives you one answer. You're like, okay, critique this. If you are my competitor, so I do this with recruiting. We have a very specific kind of offering that we offer that's a little bit more unique than not that it's better or worse, but just different from what other firms offer. So I'm like, okay, imagine you're a competitor that offers a totally different thing. And what would they say to hearing about my thing? They might be like, oh, you don't want to go there. They've things that we don't have or we have that they don't, you know, whatever. So I want to hear that stuff because that helps me, you know, better compete in the marketplace, right? Okay, there we go. All right. So you guys are going to get all this. And I'm going to just kind of re, let's just regurgitate this. Let's make it really simple and clear. So I basically just broke it down into a really simple, quick template. And this way, it's a little one-pageer. You just copy and haste this, throw it in a, throw it in a notepad file. So you have it. So you don't have to like think about this acting as a expert in whatever I'm looking to solve. Here's my goal. This is what I want, I need solved. And I want to get really specific. Here are my constraints. Here's what I have available. These are my resources I have, right? And here's the time I have. Give me suggestions, suggestions from multiple perspectives. And then let's critique it, you know, because there's always better ideas. And then let's refine and improve it. And, oh, and then also, I didn't, this is just kind of a low-bonus thing. Deliver the answer in a certain format, right? So step-by-step plan, content calendar, script with examples, right? Because what Chagging BT is really good at now is actually asking you what format at the end, but like they'll say like, would you like me to do this? To put this in a cool presentation for you. So it's pretty good about that, but feel free just to, if it doesn't, suggest that, that you could throw that in as well, say, you know, I was currently asking, I was asking it for seven ideas for new prompts to consider for my little AI agent minute video thing. And it said, would you like me to build you a content calendar with these seven ideas? I was like, oh yeah, that's a great idea. I wish I had thought of that. It did it for me. And then it said, when are you free to do these? And I was like, oh yeah, now I need to schedule it, right? So, and then it was like, okay, do you want me to put these on the calendar for you? Or do you want to do it? I was like, oh, it's so great. So you can really use chat GBT as a virtual assistant in a lot of ways too. Does anyone use it as a virtual assistant to like, yeah, pretty cool. How do you use it? Yeah. So you'll like throw in your to-dos and be like, what should I do when or here's my, here's my availability brilliant. That's a great one, right? Yes. Wow. That's a great one. Mindset, right? Like, uh, yeah, I mean, that's a wonderful one. Getting in the right mindset, having maybe some gratitude or some perspective, you know, like, I got another day. Like, a lot of people didn't get another day today. We got another day, right? That might be something that chat GBT can remind you of, right? Like, you should, you know, you should really think about, you know, how lucky we are. And that goes with those kind of things. So mindset is everything. What a great idea. And, you know, give me a little meditation to get my mind centered and focused on being, you know, calm or being, you know, productive or being grateful or whatever feelings and mindsets we want to have, you know, help, you know, help me stay on track today. You know, I put in problems. I tend to get distracted with social media. I tend, I mean, that's actually not one of mine. I get distracted in a lot of other ways, but probably a lot of us deal with like social media stuff because you guys have to be on social all the time. I don't. So I'm not as trapped as you guys might be. But that becomes a problem because you start doing scrolling. And then all of a sudden an hour goes by and maybe you're like, oh, I didn't shouldn't have done that. Okay. Well, tell chat GBT about that. I've got this problem. My girlfriend has this problem. She, she's like, she, she has a thing on her phone now where I only know the password. And it like locks her out of, I think, Instagram or something. I don't know. It locks her out because she's like, I'm not to be trusted. This is like a very successful, effective individual who is a slave to it, just like we're all slaves to certain urges that we can't, you know, do all on our own. So as to at GBT for help with that stuff, you know, I get distracted reading stuff on Reddit, right? That's kind of my version of social media. And I'm reading and I go down rabbit holes. And I'm like, what am I doing? Like it's, I need, I need help with this. So I asked chat GBT, how do I stay focused? Okay. Guys, it is 10 o'clock. I want to share with you. How much time do we have? Are we out of time? We have to 11. Okay, cool. So is this been useful, by the way? Are we getting it? Okay, cool. Cool. Well, that's all I, that's all I could have asked for. But I want to share with you. I also have 10 prompts that again, you might read these and go, I could write a better prompt. Cool. Do it, right? But I have prompts that I have talked to top agents who are using prompts just like these. And these are ones I haven't created myself. I actually got from top agents. So I figured, you know, they know better than me. So these are all different prompts. You know, I've listing persuasion. I've daily prospecting, objection handling. What else do I have? Hyper local market reports. Here's another way you can use chat GBT on your way to a showing. Ask chat GBT. Tell me everything you know about this address. Tell me everything. We got to get better than that. Acting as a first time home buyer who's moving into the area who doesn't know anything about this. Assuming that's your client or whoever your client is. Maybe they live there 30 years and whatever whoever that is. Acting as somebody who's considering buying this property. What might I want to know as this person before making a decision? I did this with my condo because I have to I'm going to be listing it shortly. And I was shocked at what it knew about my condo. Like I don't know where it got the information. I don't know if it's I don't think it's tied into. Well, it's probably tied in the MLS in some capacity because MLS is kind of everywhere now. But anyway, it knew what kind of countertops I had. I was shocked. Like it was amazing. And my place is only it's all it was built four years ago. It's not like it's been on you know. So anyway, it knows stuff. Or you might say like as a mother of three or as a family with young children, what might they want to know about the area nearest ex-address? Right? That's a good stuff. Or where's the best grocery store nearby? Or where's the closest park? Or you know, these are things that like you used to have to figure out on your own. It's kind of a lot, especially if you're going all over the place, right? It's tough. So think about questions like that. Talk it into chat, CBT on the drive over. Like, hey, what would you tell somebody looking to move in this area? What are the three coolest things about this area? What's some cool bits of trivia about this neighborhood? Or this property? Or the suburb? Or, right? These would be kind of fun things because then you can just seem like an expert, right? Even even if you didn't know it five minutes ago. So how else? I would love to know how else you guys are using chat, CBT. So start thinking about that. Thank you for those two great ideas. I love the one about the morning meditation. That is really great. I should, I'm going to start doing that. So just think about that because I'm going to bring it back to you guys in a second. Have you give me some ideas? And if you don't know because you haven't used it, how might you use it? So let's all think of one prompt that because we could share it with everybody. So let's think about something that we think that might be helpful. It does have to be perfect. But just the idea, the kernel of the idea and we'll get some, we'll have some hands in a minute. So social media content calendar, I sort of talked about this. Fizz bows and expires. Anyone doing fizz bows and expires? Some of us, those are tough, right? Ooh, you got to have, you got to have a real strong will to do fizz bows and expires because those are, that's a tough one. But are there people that have success with that? I'm like to me, that's like the hardest call you can make. There are people that love it. They're like, oh, I love it. I get deals out of it. I'm like, man, it's like going into the lion's den with those, those, they could be tough. They could yell that. But people have success with it. So that would be a great one. If you want to try fizz bows and expires, you know, you should get some, get some, get some training on those first. Because those can take you down. Has anyone, has anyone tried it and been like, what's that? Yeah, yeah, right? But has anyone tried to, am I telling the truth on fizz bows and expires? They can be tricky. And I don't mean to suggest there's anything wrong with that. Like tricky is good in a way because it scares away most other competition. So, and the people that are good at it, love it, that the fact that it's hard because other people don't do it. So I'm not saying don't do it. I think it's great. I just think it takes a very certain type of person that can handle some good rejection. And most of us are, you know, I don't know, I'm too, I'm too sensitive for that. But, but I appreciate that. I mean, I'm in recruiting. I do. But that's okay. And it projections an issue for you. Throw that in a chat, CBT. I struggle with rejection. It really hurts my feelings. It bums me out when somebody's like, hey, but, you know, close friend, I went with another agent, right? Like, how do I best handle that myself? Maybe you get some personal guidance there. And then maybe, how might I, how might I, how might you recommend, how to top agents, you know, minimize the probability of that happening, right? Because it's probably, I mean, sometimes that just happens, you know, somebody just makes a different decision. But sometimes it's on us. Sometimes it's like, well, we didn't stay in touch with that person. We were a secret REALTOR. We didn't ever tell that person. When you're ready, please call me. Or, you know, if you hear anybody out there at your job that needs help, please tell them about me, right? So there's, there's, these are ways you can consider. Just think about always be thinking about what are the problems of my business? And you always have problems. I have problems. We all have problems. Nobody has nobody's free of problems. Even the top producers, I have, um, Carrie McCormick, who's, if you, I don't know if you guys know Carrie, she works a little bit closer to the city mostly, but she's like one of the very top producers in all of the Chicago and area. Um, I don't, she's having her best year ever this year. And it's 250 million, I think, so far this year, all herself 115 sales all herself. Like no team crazy. Like she knows things. Right? So that's why I have run my show because she just was able to share things like that. But what my point is, is there are solutions to these problems, right? And a lot of times it's skill. You just got to learn a new skill. Cool part is, chat, GBT can do that. A lot of times it's knowledge or just knowing the answer to something, chat, GBT can help you with that. Right? So we have, you know, managing brokers and we have trainers and coaches and some of us have maybe pay for a coach or we have an accountability partner. By the way, if you don't have a real life in person accountability partner, please get one. Like please, please, please, we all need one. I need one. We, I, my CEO, every Monday, uh, uh, who by the way, we hired, we hired for him to do this part of his job. He has, he's like, what did you do this week? Like I don't like to answer that question because I've been there 14 years and I like help build the company. I'm like, no, I need that because I need somebody to be like, Hey, you know, what'd you do? Like what are you doing this week? Are you on target? So we all need help. So get somebody who can help keep you on track. Are there any Brian Bafini people out here? Yes. Brian Bafini is all about accountability, right? He had Joe Niego was his accountability partner. He was just a REALTOR in Chicago and he was in San Diego, I think. And they would call each other up every day and go, what'd you do today? Did you win the day? Right? Very smart. Right? So those are, that's free. And Chatchy BD can sort of help you do that, but I would get a real life person because then you can share ideas and you'll help each other and, you know, it's really fun to do that. Uh, I have an accountability partner and, uh, keeps me on target. Um, okay. Sorry, I got a little bit off track there. Uh, open house conversion blueprints. How many people find that I just, I'm not having the success converting open house leads that I would really like to have. Is that okay? Good. There's some honest, honest answers here. Good. Uh, now for anyone who didn't raise their hand, it's like, I know how to do this. You guys should find those people. I feel like, what are you doing? I want to hear. I've had the way I have an episode. I'll share it with Jennifer because I finally talked to somebody who I think has like cracked the code from San Diego, I believe. Um, just a random top agent. And he was like, Oh, I want to talk about open houses. He does his team. They do 20 to 40 open houses a weekend. No joke. He's in his 20s. This, I am, you know what he does? He calls other agents. And he's like, can I do an open house for your listing, which by the way, you guys should do too. If you don't have enough listings, at least for people in your own office, like, sure, try that. But he does it for agents at other firms. And like, which I don't think we can do an Illinois. So, yeah, I don't think that's, I don't, don't do that. But I think in California, for some reason, that's okay. So he does that. And they, these other agents love it because he puts on such an event. So I'll send you guys a link to that because you'll be shocked at all the work he does for these. Like, it's crazy. But it's a solution, right? So if you're not having luck with open houses, cool. Also appreciate that honesty. Now let's learn how to do it. ChatshipyT can help you do that too. But I have a good episode to share with you that. So open house conversion blueprint. Local authority positioning. Ooh, who is, who is constantly trying to position themselves as an expert in a geographic area? Are you guys well do it? Yes. Good idea, right? Right. I'll give you my own little little tips on this, by the way. I'm currently talking to an agent who's now my accountability partner. She's great. She's not at my firm. She's a baritone owner. And we just kind of hit it off as as friends. She is Elmwood Park, you know, in closer to the city. And she's like, I, she thought of a problem. Now this isn't a ChatshipyT thing. It's just we'll go off script for just a second. But I'll talk about how she solved this problem because I thought it was so brilliant. You could use it yourself. She thought, you know, after the pandemic, people were like, the dad is in. Like, it wasn't good for us, right? It wasn't good for us personally, right? We didn't see enough people. We weren't around enough people. People are lonelier than ever. Social media has made us disconnected. We know that this is all true. We know what it does to kids, you know, it was, it wasn't great. So people are lonely. My girlfriend, she is like, I don't have enough girlfriends. So she's like, I bet there's like a friend group like, you know, some sort of organization that can have, you know, get you to like meet other women. She wanted to meet more women specifically. She found one and she's now doing that. She has like 10 new friends. It's amazing. But back to this woman in Elmwood Park, this REALTOR. She's like, I want to be the expert in Elmwood Park. And what's the problem? What's a problem? Well, I, I'm really lonely. I'm a mom. And I don't have a lot of friends here because for whatever reason, they've moved away. And I want to make more friends. So she goes, I bet there's more people like me out there. So she goes on to her local Facebook Elmwood Park community group that she's not an admin of. She's just a member. And she says, Hey, is anyone out there feeling lonely? Do you guys want more friends? Just curious, taking the temperature of the room. And she got a lot of people like, yeah, I'm kind of lonely. And so she goes, hmm, I should probably work on creating a solution to this. So she went to a local coffee shop, who by the way, local coffee shops, especially like the nonchains, the independent ones, they got it rough, right? They're competing with Starbucks. And she's like, I want to support this local, you know, merchant because they're in my area. And I like them. So she's like, Hey, can I do a meet up here for just for like people in Elmwood Park who want to make friends? And they're like, yeah, yes, because you're going to buy coffee at her place. Sure. So she's like, cool. So she went on and she goes, we're doing this meet up group, you know, hey, just want to meet more people kind of learn more about, you know, Elmwood Park and just hang out. And she got in her first one, she got six people to show up. Now these are people she didn't know. That's a lot of people. I mean, can you, that takes courage to walk into a place where you don't know anybody. She got six people to do that. And she was like, Oh my God. So she goes, she, they, she, they, she took pictures. She shared it with the group. She's like, Can I, can I share all this? Everyone just hung out and talked and got to know each other. She's like, we're doing it again. And now she thinks I'm going to get 20 people the next time. Now she goes, I didn't even mention that I'm a REALTOR because she doesn't really have to at that point. That she's, everyone's going to learn that she's a REALTOR because they're going to go, What do you do? Right? Like that's brilliant. Right? And now Elmwood Park, she's, she's valuable to the community because Elmwood Park probably wants more people walking around, you know, hanging out at the local establishments, getting to know each other, having a more neighborly kind of community feel. Great for everyone. What a great idea. Right? So think about that. Like she's like, I need to solve my own problem of loneliness. How could I work this into my business without being salesy without being like, Hey, you know, I'm the greatest REALTOR in the area. She's not like that. She's like, I don't like, she's with Brian Biffini. She has a coach. She's like, I don't like doing pop buys. She's like, I don't want to do them. I don't want to just pop my clients house. It freaks me out. I'm like, cool, don't do that. Do this instead. You'll meet new people and you'll add more to your database. You know, great idea. So cool, right? So these are the ideas I get to talk to when I talk to top agents. And she's not even a top agent. She's like on her way up. But when I talk to top agents, they all have stuff like this. So you'll hear a lot of that on my podcast. So local authority positioning. Oh, here's the other thing she's doing. I'm sorry. This is really why I brought her up. She's making content around for video, social media, specifically around what two people who are thinking about moving to Elmwood Park need to know. Not just real estate stuff. Like, where's the best grocery store? Where's the best dentist? Where's the best hair salon? You know, where's my favorite local book shop or whatever she's into? You know, hey, I'm a mom. Where are the best resources for moms with kids in grade school? You know, where the whatever? I mean, I want to meet friends. Here's where you can go to do that. She makes videos about that. And guess how valuable that is to people who are moving to Elmwood Park? Super valuable. And she puts those on YouTube so that lives forever. Because on Facebook and Instagram and TikTok, those are more disposable, right? They're so she does that as well. She posted them on Instagram and Facebook too. But like, really smart, right? That's how you become a local expert. You share information. And by the way, where can you get ideas about how to become a local expert? Shout, GBT. How could I best position? I want to be the crystal lake person. I want to I want people to know is by the way, is there not an amazing butcher in crystal lake? Am I wrong about that? Is it on Main Street? Is that right? Or maybe not Main Street? Is that what's okay? But there is like some unreal butcher out here that's like everyone raves about, okay, because I feel like I've known that. I would go to that butcher or whoever, whatever retailer I like, be like, can I interview you for two minutes? And just I work with people in your community. And I just want to make sure everybody knows that you're the best butcher in the area. They're going to be like, yes, please. I need more business, right? And you're doing it for free. That's really generous. And they're going to share it because you're going to tag them. Right? So think about content around local authority positioning. Call the local newspaper if you have people that read newspapers. I mean, I don't know if people are still reading newspapers now, but if they are, I would go, hey, editorial desk, when you need a quote about what's going on in the housing market, please call me. I interviewed somebody who got a ton of business that way. I don't remember where in the country they are. I was like, I would have never thought of that. That's brilliant. Oh, it's in Colorado. I'm like, really? She's like, yeah, they call me every two weeks for a quote. I'm like, does that help you? She's like, it doesn't hurt me. I was like, that's awesome. Great idea. Okay. All right. I think we're good. We get it. I don't need to keep stepping on all this. We get it, right? Personal brand audit. That's a good one. What's my brand? That you should really figure out. And I don't want to go through a whole branding exercise because even though I'm a branding guy, like you can ask Chad Chibitita to walk you through a branding exercise that you should. What's my brand? How should I develop my brand? What are the feelings I want people to have about me? What are the values I need to have so that what are the actions I need to take that are in alignment with those values? Those kind of things. How do I present that to the world? Chad Chibitita can help you with all that. Okay. So you guys are going to get all this. Is this helpful? Cool. Am I teaching you more of a way to think about how to approach problems? So you should be in like, what are my problems mode all the time? Because now you have like the Oracle at Delphi that is actually going to help you solve them that you don't have to pay other than maybe 20 bucks a month if you want to. Man, coaches are expensive. And I'm not saying don't have a coach. You should like get a coach to. But still, if maybe you maybe that's not in the cards for you at the moment because they're really expensive. Well, Chad Chibitita isn't, right? And Chad Chibitita might even know more than the coaches. So anyway, get an accountability partner, please. Okay, let's think about everyone's got a problem. Let's think about it. Could be maybe it's a productivity issue. Maybe it's maybe it's following up with your prospects. Maybe it's not the open house itself. Maybe it's like following up with the people from the open house. Or maybe it's I sold a home to somebody three years ago on I don't really know how to like stay in touch. Like it's not they're not going to buy or sell right now. Like I don't know what to do. Right? So does anyone have just a general general or specific problem? Let's help you solve it right now and not to give you the answers but help you figure out a way to craft an answer in Chad Chibitita craft a question. So think of a problem you're having in your business. If someone brave enough to volunteer, be vulnerable. Okay, I'll give you one. I'll give you one. I don't always follow up with my prospects. Does anyone can anyone relate to that? Yeah. Okay. Is that a good one? Okay. Good. So okay. There we go. All right. So how might you help me if you were crafting a an answer in Chad Chibitita or a question? What might we what might we ask Chad Chibitita about how to help DJ? Well, we need to know why what what what I'm doing. What I'm not doing. Okay, I have so many prospects that I oftentimes don't remember even though I have a CRM. I don't remember. Oh, I should have like I need somebody to say here's what I need. I'll tell you the answer I need. I need Chad. I need somebody to hand me a list every day and say here's the 15 people you need to call the day instead of me trying to figure it out. That's the solution I probably need. So how might I ask Chad Chibitita to help me with that? Acting as a who would solve that problem? Time management expert, productivity coach, something like that. Person who is a top real estate recruiter. Person who yeah, something like that. That's pretty reasonable. So that could be the role. Okay, so let's go back to the the template. By the way, you're helping me do this. This is great. I need to go back to my office and make these calls. Oops, I just hit something. Here we go. Okay. So acting as a here's who can solve this problem. I want to make 15 phone calls today and for the next, you know, I want to make 15 phone calls every day. Okay, here's my problem. I've got four other side businesses that are related to real estate that I work on. I have 700 agents and I have other things I do in my day that aren't unrelated to this that get in the way. So those are those are my constraints. I have all these things flying at me and it's easy for me to take something that's coming at me versus going, okay, like ignore that and go straight into what the prospecting or the follow-ups. Okay, that's my problem. And I have an hour a day to do this. So I need an hour and a half. Give me suggestions as a real estate recruiting recruiter REALTOR recruiting coach as a productivity coach as a time management expert as a as another as somebody who yeah, those are good. Those are ones. I just do those. Then critique the ideas. Now critique your own ideas. So chat GP gives me answers. Okay, are these good answers or should we keep trying and then keep refining it? Okay, so if I imagine some of us can relate to that particular issue, making our calls. By the way, if you struggle with making your calls, you are not alone. Like, almost every agent I talk to you struggles to make their dials or whatever that version is for you. So, you know, don't worry, you're not alone. That's why it's good to have an accountability partner because you'll be like, oh, you have the same problems I do. Cool. Or at least similar problems. What about what about time management because you have other responsibilities, family? Or how about this? Let's give a different one. What about clients that text you in the evening and you're like, I don't know what to do. Do I reply? It's 9 p.m. Like, I don't, do I want to train this person message me at any time of the night? I'm not saying you shouldn't. I'm saying you have to think about that, right? Like, maybe you're cool with that? Maybe you're not. So, is this a problem we can, some of our clients are, you know, just say, well, I'm going to text you at 10 because that's what I do. And then maybe they have an expectation that you get back to them. Maybe they don't. I don't know. But this is a thing, right? Especially text because text communication doesn't end. Just goes on and on. So there's no start and end, right? So, has any, by the way, is this a problem people have? Okay, who solved this problem? Okay, let's solve it for you. How do you solve it? Yeah. Yeah. Great. And, right. And do you get pushback on that? Okay. And how do you handle the pushback? You're there. Love it. Who would say, who would think that's a pretty good answer? But do you need to say it upfront? The key. Yeah. Yeah. And what do clients do? They push boundaries sometimes, don't they? You have to stick just like children, right? Just like family, right? I think that's a thing that's a little bit more important than I think. Brilliant. You're not even going to see it. Yes. Yeah. Awesome. Does anyone ever give you a headache about that? There you go. Pretty cool. So, that's a great, those are both great, great suggestions. Okay, one of their challenges are people having. Let's make this a problem solving session. What else? Ooh, that's a good one. Okay, who solved that? Bookkeeper. Okay, bookkeeper. Acting as a bookkeeper. How would you solve an expense tracking problem? I think so. Oh, you're not a bookkeeper. You pay a bookkeeper. Okay, okay. So, who has solved it? Which is great. That's a great suggestion. Who has solved that on their own? Okay, how do you solve that? Okay. What's the name of the app? Everlands, right? That's down. That's a great one. Love it. I love that. Yeah, expense tracking. That's a tough one. I still funny enough. I still have to do my taxes for this year. I think I have a few days left. My account is about ready to kill me. Oh, it's October. Okay. Okay. Well, I'm an S-Corp, so I don't know if that's different, but September. September. Yeah, I'm September. Yeah, I'm September. Yeah, so thank you. Thank you. Yeah, so I'm in crunch mode for that. And so I've been putting that off. I've been dilly-dallying on that all year. So silly. I got to get that done this weekend. All right, what other challenges? That's expense tracking. What about prospecting? Who's having prospecting challenges? Everybody? Or not everybody? A lot of us. Okay, what are the challenges? What challenge are you having? Well, you raised your hand. A conversation about real estate with strangers. So where do you meet these people? Okay, who goes to networking events? Okay, how do you talk about real estate? Who's got an answer for? Okay, okay. Why? Why don't you talk about real estate? I'm not saying you should. I'm just asking. I'm just genuinely curious. Yeah, because you don't want to talk about yourself. You want to just learn about them? Ah, pretty good. And what does that do when somebody asks you a lot of questions about you? What does that do to the relationship? I don't care. No. Yeah. Yeah. So take the pressure off yourself. You're not, you don't have to present, right? Or some people would suggest you just have to say, how can I help you? Or what do you, what are you, what are you into? So yeah, I'm totally get that. I present. Nobody wants to hear my me pitch about my firm. They do not. Does anyone want that recruiting call? Unless you were like looking for a firm, do you want those recruiting calls? Probably not. You want somebody to be like, do you have a problem? I can help you solve it. And then you can always check out my firm on your own. I mean, people are resourceful. They can look up your website. I don't need you. They can find homes on their own. They don't need you for that. They need you to help them through the process. But learning about them, great answer. What a great suggestion. Is that helpful? Yeah, just have a lot of questions. People will eventually be like, what do you do? Oh, I don't know. like sure I don't. But I think what you have to get me a word and conversation starter, like, you have to. And by the way, is there somebody in the room that when she said I've shown somebody 50 houses goes, I would never ever show somebody 50 houses? I'm not judging it. I'm not judging it. I'm saying, are there people that have solved? Are there people that have solved that problem? Yeah, yes. Yes. OK. Is there anyone who's going to be on the view? Well, or the expectation can be, the expectation can be adjusted. Or my point is, there's a solution. Somebody has solved this problem. And by the way, maybe you should show them 50 homes. I don't know. I'm just saying she said it was a problem. So I'm not judging it. You guys are the experts. That's a great one. And by the way, yes, everyone has gone through that. Everyone has done that. Everyone has done that. If you're on the way to get your money, put that one behind and put it. Yeah, it's tough to. You get a lesson next person about your car. But she can hold on to the car. And when they're very close, maybe. Letting clients go is a very empowering thing I hear from what people tell me. It's very empowering. There's a lot of them. What else? So that's a great one. That's a, by the way, thank you for that sharing that. That's really awesome. Let's give one more. And then we'll just work. Work life balance. OK, who has some suggestions around? Are you talking about personal life and professional life? Work life. OK, so some of us are parents. Some of us are single probably or in relationships. Some of them have kids. Some of us don't. Some of us have other responsibilities work-wise. Who has some good suggestions for people who have other stuff going on? Go ahead. You're never going to have some kind of experience. You're never going to have some kind of experience. You're never going to have some kind of experience. Ooh, that's good. Yeah, do people in our lives know when we're present? Do they know when we're on our phones? They do. They do. So that's great. And yeah, balances. I'm not a big believer in the word balance. I just have never found it personally. So good luck. If you find it, let me know. But there are adjustments that can be made. And it's understanding to what are the problems. That's how you solve balance. I'll never fully be solved. Because once you solve one problem, another one pops up. But that's just life, right? So it's not about getting rid of the problems. It's just about knowing, OK, I've got this problem now. How do I solve it? Ask chat, GPT for help, or ask lovely people in this room. How helpful is everyone being, by the way? Isn't this great? Isn't it so lonely sometimes when we work at home and we don't have direct access to people? Maybe we don't go into an office? Nobody ever comes into our office. So yeah, so this is so cool. Use people, not only use them in a useful way, right? Be of service to them. These people are dying to give you health, right? So I'm sorry. Go ahead. I did how you ask me that with fourth-eyed exams, I feel like, I mean Dr. Nd Moreieu has read today's knockout final exam. Do you have apps these lower thanих undergraduate maths? Yes, I do. So if this was a lookeduan, I would condemn cases like students and cr!​ Yeah. Yeah. I might talk to you in the morning, and you know, Robin, so you're right, I can be in the full volume too. So, right. As you should focus on when you're asking questions. How you are going to deal with an answer that is actually that's just, and you have the breath, but why are you not asking questions? Well, then the answer is, for your answer, I'm going to ask you, for your answer, or we would call that Copa Head, right? Like, I'm about to walk into this thing. Copa Head. Yeah. Copa Head. You know, it's a good idea. It really helps when things go a different way than you expect. So, before that, expect, maybe they will go that way. Was that the Cal Newport? By the way, who's a Mel Robbins fan? Isn't she great? Well, thank goodness for her, right? So, yeah, she just had on Cal Newport, who is a really, he's a time management guy, and a productivity guy, and he's all about slowing down productivity, doing less. And he's like a, he's a professor at, I forget where, but he's like big deal. He's like, he's like, he's a data scientist, and he's awesome. So, yeah, check out the, check out Mel Robbins, if you, that's a great, great podcast for, in my opinion. Okay, let's go one more. What, once one more challenge we're having? What about other agents? Any challenges with other agents? Hey, I live there, man, I can, I know. I know. Unfriendly agents, maybe. Some unfriendly people. But, okay, but how about getting somebody to call you back when you have a question about their listing? Feedback. The question is, if the people are getting, you know, either blind or blind, but they're back. Oh. So, how do we get, how can we get feedback in a way that's not going to get you sued? I'm going to have to be, not for that. Okay. Oh. Now, the conditions for these folks instead of, so, yes, you want to get somebody to, you get a doctor's knowing time conflict to ask questions, you want something. So, you can say, I'm not looking for your virus, you got to, I wonder if you can. Great suggestion. Now, what about when we call agents to get feedback and they don't return the call? How might we, well, that's true, too? Well, yeah, okay. Yeah. So, so, so, what do you do in the, so what do you do? You text message. There you go. Or you just say, can I do it via text? Yeah. What do you think of the property? Who would much rather respond to a text message than a call? A lot of people. A lot of, not everyone, but some people. That's a great suggestion. I love that. Oh. Oh. So, that's a good one. Cool. Alright guys, we are, we did a lot today. Let's all congratulate ourselves. We'll look at us helping each other. Cool!
