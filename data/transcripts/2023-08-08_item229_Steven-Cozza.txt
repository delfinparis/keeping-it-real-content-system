[00:01:31] Hello and welcome to another episode of Keeping It Real, the largest podcast made by real estate
[00:01:36] agents and four real estate agents.

[00:01:43] We're going to be speaking with top 1% producer Stephen Kosa.
[00:01:47] But before we get to Stephen, just a couple of quick reminders.
[00:01:50] The best way that you can help our show, two things you can do first.
[00:01:54] So I should say the best ways you can help our show.
[00:01:56] The first way is to tell a friend.
[00:01:58] Of course, think of one other agent in your office or someone you know out there practicing
[00:02:03] who hasn't heard of our show and could use some of the wisdom that these top producers
[00:02:08] share on every episode.
[00:02:09] And the second way that you can help us support our sponsors, I personally hand select our
[00:02:15] sponsors, well, Zana and I.

[00:02:30] by telling a friend.
[00:02:31] All right, guys, let's get to the main event.

[00:04:01] Stephen, welcome to the show.
[00:04:03] Yeah, thanks DJ.
[00:04:04] I'm honored to be here.
[00:04:05] Thanks for having me.
[00:04:07] Well, we're excited to have you and really I always love what's such a neat part
[00:04:13] of this job for me or this, I don't know if it's really a job so much as just a fun thing for me to do.
[00:04:18] But I get to have conversations with not only people that I think would be interesting to our audience,
[00:04:23] which of course is the ultimate goal, but interesting to me as well.
[00:04:27] And I have always been fascinated by people that perform at high levels, whether it's in business,
[00:04:34] sports, any field really.
[00:04:36] I'm just always drawn to what I consider to be sort of excellence and skill.
[00:04:42] And so I'm excited to chat with you and how you were able to take some of those learnings from
[00:04:47] from your previous career as an athlete.
[00:04:50] But let's start all the way at the very beginning.
[00:04:52] Number one, how did you get into real estate or why real estate?
[00:04:56] Yeah, totally.
[00:04:57] So, well, I got into this is kind of funny.
[00:05:00] I got into, I became a professional athlete through cycling.
[00:05:04] And when I was in school, I never did well in school.
[00:05:07] I was dyslexic and I struggled there.
[00:05:11] So I always excelled in sports.
[00:05:12] It was just where I gravitated to.
[00:05:14] And my mom grew up, my dad grew up, and baby boomers got to go to college, got to go to college.
[00:05:20] So it was pretty tough for me to break out of that mold.
[00:05:23] But it was an avenue for me to not have to go to college, sort of speak.
[00:05:28] So I really, really, really busted my butt to make it as a professional athlete.
[00:05:34] I raised in Europe for 10 plus years.
[00:05:39] And that's what kind of led me into my real estate career in a weird way.
[00:05:43] Because my mom would always say, invest in a 401k from my cycling invest,
[00:05:51] did your retirement, did your retirement, and I said,
[00:05:53] mom, I don't even know the house.
[00:05:54] Why would I put money into a 401k?
[00:05:57] I don't have a place to live.
[00:05:59] I'm renting, so I said, I'm going to save my house.
[00:06:02] So I said, forget the 401k for a while.
[00:06:04] I saved my first house.
[00:06:07] And then just kept going from there.
[00:06:08] And I started buying more properties, rentals, all while I was racing.
[00:06:14] So it was kind of an easy transition from when I left cycling to
[00:06:20] move into a role of wanting to help others do what I had done with real estate.
[00:06:25] And yeah, so that's how I got into it.
[00:06:27] And little did I know how much cycling would actually help me with my career in real estate.
[00:06:32] It was quite incredible.
[00:06:34] And I look forward to talking about that a bit today.
[00:06:37] I'm excited to hear about that too.
[00:06:39] I also curious just because cycling was, you know, I'm 47.
[00:06:44] And so maybe it's an age thing.
[00:06:46] But I, and also I grew up in central Illinois,
[00:06:50] where that just wasn't a sport.
[00:06:52] It may have been a sport, but it certainly wasn't a known thing where there was like,
[00:06:57] oh, that's an option.
[00:06:58] You know, there was football, baseball, basketball.
[00:07:00] If you were lucky, you had some maybe tennis and golf.
[00:07:03] If you had the ability to do those kind of sports,
[00:07:06] or hockey also is in that category.
[00:07:09] But cycling just wasn't really known to me other than what I would see on TV.
[00:07:13] So just out of curiosity, how did you even sort of pursue being a professional cyclist?
[00:07:18] Was that something you knew from an early age that you wanted to do?
[00:07:21] Was that popular in, in, you know, where you grew up?
[00:07:24] Just out of curiosity.
[00:07:26] Yeah, I mean, I moved from, I played ball sports, baseball, soccer.
[00:07:30] And then it's gotten across country running in high school.
[00:07:33] I realized that wasn't so good at the ball sports.
[00:07:36] Better than during sports.
[00:07:37] And from, during my running years,
[00:07:41] my friends got me to start mountain biking.
[00:07:44] And I would take my mom's mountain bike.
[00:07:46] Before I knew it, I broke it.
[00:07:47] And she's like, all right, let me get you your own mountain bike.
[00:07:50] And then they really supported me.
[00:07:52] I started doing races, started winning.
[00:07:54] And then in 97, one Lance won his first Tour of France.
[00:07:58] I said, oh my gosh, I gotta do that.
[00:08:00] I broke my shoulder in a wrestling accident in high school.
[00:08:03] And I had to ride on the road for a year.
[00:08:06] And I transitioned over from there.
[00:08:08] And got on the national team.
[00:08:11] So that's kind of how I got into it.
[00:08:13] Loved from ball sports, the cycling sports.
[00:08:16] Wow, that's, that's amazing.
[00:08:17] I guess you're right when Lance did win.
[00:08:20] He became the biggest athlete in the world, pretty much.
[00:08:24] Or one of them.
[00:08:25] And so you're right.
[00:08:26] That really brought cycling more to the forefront of the average person in this country's awareness of
[00:08:34] like, oh, this is a thing.
[00:08:35] And this is a thing where you can have a lot of success.
[00:08:39] And here's this American just crushing it.
[00:08:42] So, I was curious.
[00:08:44] Well, that's amazing.
[00:08:45] So, I remember to go back to that.
[00:08:48] I remember there was a friend of mine who's dad was a big cyclist.
[00:08:51] He told me one day, I was like 15 years old.
[00:08:54] He said, Stephen, only one in a million can become a professional cyclist.
[00:09:00] And I, and it always got me when someone told me I couldn't do something.
[00:09:04] So at that moment, I decided, well, I'm going to prove him wrong.
[00:09:07] And it kind of rolled over into real estate with that same kind of attitude.
[00:09:12] Because real estate is a very hard career to make it.
[00:09:15] And I mean, I never knew it was as hard as it is now that I'm in it.
[00:09:18] I realized it.
[00:09:20] When you, when you hear about, you see all these agents posting on their open houses
[00:09:23] making money here and there, you think it's a lot easier than it is once you're in it.
[00:09:27] So, you got to have that tenacity.
[00:09:30] Yeah, I always think like the time, by the time you have a showing or you have a buyer,
[00:09:37] you've almost already won the hardest part of the business, which is getting clients and getting
[00:09:42] that to trust you in that purchase or sale.
[00:09:46] Absolutely.
[00:09:46] So, I think, yeah, I think you're so right that we,
[00:09:52] especially on this show too, I have to be very careful because when I talk to really successful
[00:09:56] teams or agents like yourself, we have both.
[00:10:01] There could be a tendency for one of our listeners or a lot of our listeners to think like,
[00:10:06] well, he's already over the hump of the hardest part of this business.
[00:10:10] Not realizing that maybe the lead generation part becomes a little bit easier over time as you
[00:10:15] build up a reputation and you get more referrals and you figure out what marketing strategies work.
[00:10:20] But it's still certainly a grind in a way, meaning like you still have to put in the reps and the
[00:10:27] hours into this probably in a lot of the same ways that you did when you first started.
[00:10:31] So, I'm excited to learn about what you learned as an athlete and then taking some of those
[00:10:38] lessons into real estate. So, can you tell us a little bit about that?
[00:10:43] Yeah, totally. So, when you jump into real estate, there's different routes you can go.
[00:10:48] You can get on a team and you can try to maybe you inherited the business or maybe you're working with
[00:10:53] a parent. I didn't have any of that. Actually, my mom works with me now. She was a teacher for
[00:10:59] 40 years taught kindergarten and when she retired, I said, hey, come join our real estate team and
[00:11:04] she's great. She's total natural at it. So, it was kind of the reverse of what you normally see.
[00:11:11] But so, you have these different routes to take and when you get on a team,
[00:11:19] being on a team is a great thing. You get a lot of support. But sometimes you don't learn
[00:11:24] how to necessarily, you don't learn the process of always how to get your own business.
[00:11:30] So, and when I started, when I went to, it was Frankard Allen at the time. It was the biggest
[00:11:37] brokerage in the Bay Area. They were around since from 1910 to like 2000 and I think probably 16.
[00:11:45] They're around for a long time. So, I joined Frankard Allen, but when I interviewed with the,
[00:11:50] when I met the manager Jim Michaelson, who's actually still the manager of our office today with
[00:11:55] Compass now, I actually, I had no, I still didn't, I didn't know anything about real estate at all.
[00:12:01] I'd gotten my license, which doesn't really teach you what you really need to know.
[00:12:06] In the business. And so, I remember Jim told me later on, he talked to the manager of Frankard
[00:12:12] Allen and Larry goes, why would you take on a professional athlete? He doesn't, he doesn't,
[00:12:17] he's not going to be a good, and Jim goes, are you kidding me? If he could be a professional athlete,
[00:12:21] then he can be a good real estate agent. And Jim was right. And I think that like a lot of the
[00:12:26] listeners today, something to understand. And, you know, we're always getting pounded over the
[00:12:31] head with every shiny whistle and every every shiny bell and whistle. This product or this
[00:12:37] product or this system or this process. But I think it's important to kind of get back to
[00:12:43] the basics of what makes a good real estate agent. And I studied this when I first got in the
[00:12:49] business because I studied the best in the business in our area. And I was like, how are they doing
[00:12:55] this? What makes them so good? And I remember I went to talk to the best REALTOR in our town,
[00:13:00] year over year, for that she still is for like 40 years. And I said, hey, Peg, how do you do it?
[00:13:08] Like, what are you doing? What's your secret? And she said, you know what, Steven, there's,
[00:13:12] there's really no secrets except for this one thing. And she said, consistency. She's consistent,
[00:13:18] she's consistent with everything she does. And that really stuck with it for me because that's how
[00:13:24] it was as a professional athlete. It's consistency. And it's following a process. It's following a plan
[00:13:30] and it's having a coach. I can't stress how important it is to have a coach. And maybe you're
[00:13:37] not in a position to where you're quite ready to pay for a coach. I think it's a great investment,
[00:13:41] that gets a great return. But keep listening to keeping a real podcast, things like this, that
[00:13:47] that is your coach. I mean, you can get carried away with too many things going after too many things.
[00:13:52] So keep keep your focus when you're you're listening to different podcasts. But
[00:13:58] have a plan and have a plan that keeps you accountable. And so if anybody listening today wants to have,
[00:14:05] we have all our agents on the team. They follow it's our power hour tracker. And sometimes it goes
[00:14:12] more than an hour a day. But it it has the key elements to our success built into it. And then it
[00:14:20] makes it so that we stay focused during that hour to achieve those things. And then from there,
[00:14:26] it's like you work with your clients, you're showing properties and so forth, but you start with this.
[00:14:31] And from there, that's where all your success comes from. So it's our power hour tracker. I'm happy
[00:14:34] to share that. But to go back to about from cycling to to real estate, I'm very lucky in the fact that
[00:14:42] I was able to have a career such a cycling because it did give me a little bit of an advantage with
[00:14:48] knowing you can work your butt off and still get no results. You can pound your head against the
[00:14:53] wall and still not win a race. Same thing with real estate. And the best real estate agents out there,
[00:14:59] they're the best at getting back up because they know the sooner they get back up, the sooner they're
[00:15:05] going to have their next success. And then they're going to annotated wrong as they go. So I
[00:15:11] obsess over listing presentations. I could not stand how many I lost in the beginning because
[00:15:17] you know, I'm competing against like pig and so forth. And now I don't lose them. I mean, I just
[00:15:23] got another one where I was competing against, you know, the top Asian in the town. And I get them
[00:15:28] at 6%, sometimes I get them at 7%. So it's just it's that whole coaching athlete mentality where
[00:15:38] you're tweaking your performance, you're tweaking what's going on, you're working with the plan,
[00:15:42] you're making a better year after year and you're improving on it and the best you can. And not
[00:15:47] getting down when you get knocked down because let's face it, real estate can be a losing support.
[00:15:54] And it's not easy. It's very hard, but there's a lot of rewards that come with that that hardness,
[00:15:59] you know, and it's there's a lot of positives. Otherwise, I wouldn't be doing it.
[00:16:04] I have a couple of couple of things I want to I want to pause on only because I don't know,
[00:16:10] no, no, no, you were doing perfect. I just there I had a bunch of thoughts as you were talking because
[00:16:15] you said a lot of really, really great things there. And I just want to make sure that we we pause
[00:16:20] and step on them for a little bit for the audience. First of all, you mentioned sharing your power
[00:16:25] hour information. What's the best way that one of our listeners? And by the way, everybody should
[00:16:30] do this right now. So I want to say it before I forget what's the best way they could reach out to
[00:16:34] get that information? For sure. Yeah. Just email me at eska's at homes,
[00:16:40] talk to the comments the best way you can email me and we'll get it right back to you.
[00:16:45] Great. We'll have a link to that in the show description and notes as well. Also,
[00:16:49] this this idea of being coachable, you know, it's something that that I the times I've had athletes
[00:16:55] on the show like yourself, they've all said this. And it's really important. We sort of forget
[00:17:00] that every professional athlete, I can't think of an exception to this. I'm probably is one or two,
[00:17:05] but 99% of professional athletes have coaches, right? Maybe it's 100%. But certainly even the most
[00:17:11] elite, the people at the very, very, very top of that whatever mountain, you know, particular mountain
[00:17:17] they're climbing, they still have somebody watching going, oh, you know, maybe do this instead of that
[00:17:21] and stay on target. And one of the things that reminded me, you talked about getting a coach.
[00:17:27] And I just wanted to share the suggestion as, well, what if I can't afford a coach right now? And
[00:17:31] I know there's always that you can't afford not to. Okay, that's fine. But sometimes people
[00:17:35] literally just can't afford to do it. And so I was thinking of a story, Brian Baphini would tell
[00:17:41] when he couldn't afford to have a coach or couldn't find one. He, and actually, was a guy here in
[00:17:46] Chicago. He befriended this guy in Chicago, Joniago. And they were the, each other's accountability
[00:17:51] partner and Averday they would call each other at night and go, did you win the day? And they had
[00:17:56] their own, you know, sort of whatever winning the day meant to both of them. And so that was a
[00:18:00] free thing that they did. And you can certainly at least find somebody in your local market to help
[00:18:07] with that. But ideally hiring a coach would be sort of, you know, even better than that.
[00:18:12] I did want to mention just a couple other quick, quick things. I definitely want to ask you about
[00:18:16] any listing presentation suggestions you might have. We won't go to that quite yet. But I definitely
[00:18:21] want to hear, you know, how you've become better because you obsess about those. But I also think
[00:18:26] back to the athlete thing, this idea of failing is, is so scary to us, right? We're afraid of it. It's
[00:18:34] the reason why we don't pick up phones and, and make certain phone calls. It's, it's the reason that
[00:18:38] probably holds us back because nobody likes to be rejected. No one likes to fail.
[00:18:43] Athletes though get a lot of experience not winning because of course that's the pathway to winning
[00:18:50] is actually failing. And so how important is it to be able to take the L and to, and to not let it
[00:18:57] defeat you? And, and as you said, it's about getting back up. But how important is it to learn how to
[00:19:08] I would say, yeah, it's not an easy thing to get comfortable with. It's hard. But the way I look
[00:19:15] at it, when I get, when I have a loss, I look at what I can do differently and then use it as a
[00:19:19] positive because you learn from your losses. If you don't have your losses, you're not learning.
[00:19:24] And, and nothing comes easy. I mean, well, encycling there and, and professional sports, there's
[00:19:30] always the perform the, the dopeers and stuff that people who are going to cheat in real estate.
[00:19:34] And I, by the way, I never took performance enhancing drugs. Otherwise, that probably wouldn't
[00:19:38] need to be selling real estate. But, but it did, it does happen. And with, with real estate, there's
[00:19:48] no quick way to the top. So you're going to lose. And if you are like on a team and they're giving
[00:19:54] you all the leads, you're never going to learn how to get them yourself. And if you ever want to go
[00:19:57] somewhere else, you're not going to have that. So I would say the only one is the hardest way in,
[00:20:02] in real estate. And it's worth it. And, and through podcasts like this, you're going to learn the
[00:20:07] systems and, and processes that help you, as far and in a better way. So, well, thank you. By
[00:20:13] the way, I also forgot to say thank you so much for the wonderful plug you gave just a little bit
[00:20:17] ago to our, to our show. I am, I am to, to humble sometimes to, to even ask for our audience to
[00:20:25] participate here with our show. But I appreciate you seeing the value in this and also being of
[00:20:30] service to our audience and, and sharing. But yeah, I'm sorry, go, go back to, sort of being an
[00:20:36] athlete. So we understand you have this, we, you know, you're talking about consistency. And,
[00:20:40] and we can certainly dive into what does that actually look like for you? What are the key?
[00:20:45] Actually, let's just start there. What are the key behaviors or activities that help,
[00:20:51] sorry, that are the ones you need to be the most consistent on even today? Have, are those essentially
[00:20:57] similar to when you started? Are they changed over time? That's a great question. So what is that
[00:21:04] what is consistency mean? What are the activities and so forth? And how have they changed? So I would say
[00:21:09] for us, for me, for the team, for, for actually every real estate agent, if, if you're trying something
[00:21:17] and it's not working, well, a lot of times it's not working because you haven't done it long enough.
[00:21:22] Well, you need to, you need to stick through it, stick with it. And so I've always, I've always
[00:21:27] set goals, you know, that my first was going back to cycling. I said, if I don't become a professional
[00:21:33] cyclist by the time I'm 23, I'm going to have to go to college. So that put this like pressure on
[00:21:38] me to, to be consistent, to be following the process. And then same with real estate, I said, if I don't,
[00:21:44] if I'm not making, you know, with the top 20% or making within the first three years of the business,
[00:21:50] I'm going to stop and I'm going to go to school, become a firefighter. So I put that pressure on myself.
[00:21:54] And I think the same thing goes with like any prospecting plan that you set out to do,
[00:22:00] give yourself time and set a reasonable time. So like if my farming this market, farming this
[00:22:06] neighborhood, if that doesn't provide results within three years, that's what I did. One of my first
[00:22:11] prospecting thing was farming the neighborhood I lived in. And I still do it to this day of expanded
[00:22:16] it, of course. But it took me, I would say it took me two, three years before I got a listing or
[00:22:24] any action from that farm. And guess what I had to do? Every quarter, every quarter, I would
[00:22:31] hand deliver a thousand printed newsletters and there were 11 by 11 by 17, you know,
[00:22:39] openfold. And it wasn't just about real estate. This was, you know, it touched on real estate, of course,
[00:22:44] but it was very community based, very, very localized. We did, in our time, there's a river that
[00:22:51] comes through it. We did pedal my river cleanups. We did neighborhood garage sale day. So it's like
[00:22:56] a trail, you know, we're trying to list and you have all the garage sales and it's fun. Like,
[00:23:00] you know, tons of homes, do it and there's all these garage sales all over the area. We always had,
[00:23:06] you know, posted the events and things we were doing. So that took me three years before I got
[00:23:13] business. And now I've made hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars off that farm. I've had
[00:23:19] sellers come out of that and they've done four or five transactions with me now and they've
[00:23:23] referred to other people and it's like this tree. I remember I took got my real estate license
[00:23:28] through John Lomblow. He's not, he's not alive anymore. I mean, it got, it was back in 2012. It was
[00:23:33] practically, I think we're using VHS tapes to do it. But he said, he said, do something and start
[00:23:40] off with a farm. And I know it sounds old fashioned, but I'm telling you, it's connecting and I would
[00:23:46] just hand drop under the mats. I would not knock on doors. It's a thousand homes, right? Walking
[00:23:50] them. Now we mail. But I still think that connection being out in the community, I met so many people
[00:23:57] while I was doing that. So consistency. Don't give up. Well, I want to point out this idea because
[00:24:05] I was, you had mentioned that you were handing them out and then you were mentioning there's other
[00:24:09] ways too, which you were participating in the community doing volunteer efforts, you know, helping
[00:24:15] garage sales and, you know, just just anything you can do to get your name out there. And at the same
[00:24:19] time, hand delivering a thousand, a thousand, you know, newsletters, which were, which was actually,
[00:24:26] I like the idea that you did them bigger than the standard size too. Just makes it a little bit,
[00:24:30] you know, more interesting to hold and sort of harder to immediately throw away maybe. But the idea
[00:24:36] of putting the work in is, you know, I, I'm hearing just obviously as professional athlete, you're
[00:24:42] putting in a lot of reps, you're, you're practicing, you're practicing fundamentals and, and advanced
[00:24:47] strategies too. But always going back to those, you know, cycling is no, well, I know nothing about
[00:24:53] cycling personally, but I'm assuming it's no different from so many other sports where it's just a
[00:24:57] lot of practice, of course. So it's kind of even a silly thing to, to reflect on. But the idea of,
[00:25:02] of just repetition and reps, doing the reps and, and seeing those. And then, and then by the way,
[00:25:08] not looking at it a year in going, you know, no results, I've got nothing. And you're like, I still
[00:25:13] got to stand out a thousand more of these next month. And I'm going to keep doing it until I get
[00:25:18] results because obviously we know that that pathway should work over time. We know that it's not,
[00:25:26] it's not really a risky thing. It's just a lot of, a lot of time, a lot of effort. And, and, and it
[00:25:31] worked out for you hundreds of thousands of dollars in commissions. And it's also something that,
[00:25:36] as an athlete, you just get, you understand the work that's, that's needed. So this is just like
[00:25:40] putting in your, your reps at the gym. Totally. And when I started that far, I, I'd ran it up on
[00:25:47] a credit card, but I'll tell you it, I mean, printing is so cheap, you know, you print a thousand
[00:25:52] brochures. It's super cheap. And John Lomblow said, you know, he said quality over quantity, you know,
[00:25:57] so he said his thing was go to 250 homes around you and not and really established those connections.
[00:26:03] I'm not a real knock or cold call kind of, I just, I know I need to move in that direction. I need to
[00:26:09] become more personal or more forward, but I'm definitely, I don't want to, I don't like when people
[00:26:15] knock on my door. So I don't really want to do it. And, you know, it, it just worked the way I did it.
[00:26:21] And so, but yeah, like you said, repetition. And here's another really important thing. You only
[00:26:26] can do so much. My coach would always tell me he said the best, the best REALTORS in the business,
[00:26:32] they have three to five prospecting methods. He said, Steven, start off with two to three,
[00:26:39] build them out, build a fence around them. So they're like their own little ecosystem. They're
[00:26:43] working for them, you know, for you. And then you can add on more, but first build them out and
[00:26:47] surround it, make it bomb proof and then go to your next one. And not all prospecting methods
[00:26:53] have to cost money either. So, you know, speaking to like social media there. So if you're new in
[00:26:58] the business and you're, you're, you know, you don't have a lot of farms, you know, own, own the
[00:27:06] social media world, you know, that can, that alone, that, and of course, open houses, that's a given.
[00:27:11] But as far as the print stuff, you just got to think about the return on your investment. You know,
[00:27:17] if you get one deal, is it going to cover, you know, and then how many deals you're going to get
[00:27:22] over time of, you know, course your career. So yeah, those are really, really great strategies.
[00:27:29] And also too, like the idea of doing these volunteer, you know, community outreach kind of
[00:27:36] programs, oftentimes can be low cost to no cost, right? Like if you're offering to volunteer,
[00:27:43] you're going to clean up, you know, like a river or some waterway or, you know, a stretch of the
[00:27:50] highway or, or anything or volunteering at a local, you know, shelter or whatever, those things
[00:27:56] are, are usually low cost because if you do invite your, your audience, I went to,
[00:28:01] sorry, interrupted myself, but I went to one of the very best of those that I've witnessed.
[00:28:07] It was a Compass agent of all, of all things I hear in Chicago. By the way, I also want to do a
[00:28:12] quick plug for something. And I can't remember the gentleman's name who, who runs it. But if you
[00:28:17] are a Compass agent, and we know there's a lot of you that listen because we've had a million
[00:28:20] Compass agents on our show because they're just, you know, taking over. But there's a great thing
[00:28:26] called the 6am or club, which, yeah, which, and I, the gentleman that runs it. Sky Michaels. Sky
[00:28:33] Michaels. Yeah, he's great. He does momentum Monday too. So he's a free coach for Compass. And
[00:28:40] I've gotten so many golden nuggets from him. It's incredible. And, and little plug for my
[00:28:45] interview with Sky Michaels. Just one of the, one of the neatest guys I've ever had on our show.
[00:28:50] And if you're a Compass person, please take advantage of that. You're very lucky to have,
[00:28:54] not you, Steven, but the company's very lucky to have sky. So please check out the 6am or club.
[00:29:00] Also, maybe if you're interested in, and not that I get paid to promote Compass as a company,
[00:29:05] but a good reason to consider them. If you need some accountability, they've got a fun little
[00:29:10] way to do that. So anyway, but back, back, of course, to Steven, I, we, I'd be remiss if we didn't
[00:29:16] mention your, your amazing team as well. It's not just you, you, you, you go a wonderful group of
[00:29:21] people around you. Can you tell us a little bit about the team and, and sort of why you developed one?
[00:29:26] Absolutely. Real quick. Back to that, the newsletter. This is just in the volunteering thing.
[00:29:31] This is just a very basic thing. But this shows you the power of that farm. You can take a great
[00:29:37] non-profit in the area and you can go to them. So like we have mentor me or relief pet alumna.
[00:29:44] And you can say, hey, mentor me. What are some, what's a fundraiser coming up for something that
[00:29:48] we can promote in our newsletter for you? And we do it for free. You know, and then of course,
[00:29:52] so that's great because you're, you're doing something different. You're, you're, our whole Y is
[00:29:57] giving back, you know, our team Y. And so you're connecting with this whole organization by promoting
[00:30:03] them. And now our newsletter goes that to 10,000 homes. So these, these charities, these people
[00:30:09] are really benefiting from what we're doing. So it's like, it's like killing two birds with one stone,
[00:30:14] right? And so we always try to do that. We also have our deferred lender. He advertises in it.
[00:30:19] He's got his little section. So he helps pay for it. So think of stuff like that. You're going to
[00:30:23] have service providers pay for a lot of stuff. So yeah, about the team. Having a team has been a
[00:30:30] huge thing for the Coz team, of course, like turning it into that has made a big difference in my
[00:30:36] life. And then of course, in their lives as well. I, I was a workaholic the first, I would say,
[00:30:43] there's a being in the business. I ended up going through a divorce. It really taxed my life.
[00:30:48] And that was obviously my own choice to be a workaholic. I could have, you know, backed it down. But
[00:30:54] my coach, when I finally had a good coach, he taught me how to have systems and how to
[00:30:59] build a team. And so we've got our market. The first person I hired was a marketing person.
[00:31:06] And I don't know if that's very common, but I realized, well, you know, I can handle working with
[00:31:12] clients, but the back end marketing stuff, the social media, all that. That's where we're getting
[00:31:19] our dips in business. So we hired a marketing lady who now has a real estate license and our
[00:31:24] business more than doubled after that. Like that, it totally, it doubled. That was the year of business
[00:31:29] doubled. So, did you know that that was, did you know that hiring a marketing person was, you know,
[00:31:38] that or not not hiring a market, but identifying that that was that that's where the whole was
[00:31:43] in in the business to fill that that you can't do everything and be everything as as a solo
[00:31:49] practitioner. Obviously, there's going to be things that you enjoy doing or that you're good at
[00:31:53] and other things that aren't necessarily easy for you to do or that you want to do.
[00:31:58] Totally. Yeah, it was the consistency thing. I kept going back to what Peg told me in the
[00:32:03] beginning, you got to be consistent. And that's where I was, I was lacking was the consistency with my,
[00:32:09] with the marketing, the prospecting, with the stuff that I didn't do personally. And my coach said,
[00:32:15] well, calculate how much you make an hour, you know, find out what you make an hour. And then
[00:32:20] ask yourself if it's worth spending your time on that. And if it's not, then hire someone to do it.
[00:32:26] That was really, I would say, a change in point in my career was when I started treating my business
[00:32:33] like a business, because far often too many times us agents, we get stuck in the business. We got
[00:32:41] to, we got to step out of it and work on our business. So, I recommend anybody listening,
[00:32:45] taking our day, you can always find after you do your power hour before you do your power, spend an
[00:32:51] hour, two, so there's two hours there now, spend an hour working on your business, not in your
[00:32:56] business. And once you start working on your business on a daily basis, that's where you're going
[00:33:02] to start seeing a lot of growth because you're not going to be stuck in it. When you're stuck in it,
[00:33:06] that's when you start to see these big dips and slow periods. But when you, when you really work
[00:33:10] on your business, that's where you start to grow and consistently have business. That's what I
[00:33:16] realized at least. I remember learning in college, there's a Steven Covey book. I can't remember if
[00:33:24] it's first things first or highly, you know, habits of highly successful people. Whatever it was,
[00:33:29] he had this matrix that I thought was something's very hard to do, I think for me, but really,
[00:33:37] really important that I think sort of speaks to what you just said, which is he called it the urgency
[00:33:41] versus importance matrix, which is really just four, four boxes, you know, something comes at you,
[00:33:46] you put it in one of these four boxes and that gives you an idea of how and when to respond to it.
[00:33:51] So it's just because something flies at you in the form of an email, a text, a phone call,
[00:33:55] doesn't necessarily mean at its urgent. It means it feels urgent because it just came in, we see it,
[00:34:01] where, you know, our brains are wired to want to fix solve problems, but it doesn't necessarily mean
[00:34:05] it's the best course of action at that particular time. And you just sort of run it through a like,
[00:34:09] how important is this, how urgent is it? And then you decide when and when to respond back to it.
[00:34:14] I imagine as an athlete, you were constantly having to evaluate, you know, especially, you know,
[00:34:21] while you're racing, you know, what's important, what's urgent, what do I need to take action on now,
[00:34:25] what adjustments do I need to make? And there's probably, you probably also learn just really great
[00:34:30] decision-making strategies when you're competing at that level. It's all about making decisions
[00:34:35] in the moment that are best for you, best for the team. Can you talk a little bit about
[00:34:41] under, you know, when things fly at you, how do you sort of determine this? I got to reply to
[00:34:46] right away or this, this can hold off, even though this might seem urgent in the moment. How do I,
[00:34:51] you know, how do you make those decisions? Well, I got to tell you, I'm still kind of learning that
[00:34:56] in real estate in cycling. It was pretty easy and because it was one focus, it's like everything's
[00:35:01] for cycling. It was real estate, everything's for real estate, but there's volunteering, there's this,
[00:35:07] there's that, there's all these different things that call for your attention or, you know,
[00:35:12] trying to do too much. And so I'm still learning that, but something that I recently heard,
[00:35:18] Warren Buffett said, well, he, so the story goes, he was in his private jet and the pilot, his
[00:35:26] pilot asked him, hey, Warren, how do you prioritize your time? And Warren goes well to the j...
[00:35:35] Most 25 things to you in your life. Cheating you want to be a better father, you want to be
[00:35:41] better at selling real estate, you want to be healthier, more, you know, more fitness. Take 25 of those
[00:35:47] things and make a list of it. And then Warren goes, okay, now that you have that list of 25 things,
[00:35:54] take five of them, take the top five of those 25 and make a list of the top five. And then
[00:36:01] now Warren goes, okay, now that you have the top five things you want to achieve or do or be in your
[00:36:06] life, take those other 20 things and throw them. Because life is finite. We have enough time. He says,
[00:36:13] if you can just focus on those five things, you're going to do the best you can at them and maybe by
[00:36:18] the time you die, you'll be able to achieve them. Maybe you won't, but at least you're going to know
[00:36:21] you did your best. But if you have the other 20 there, you're not going to be good at anything.
[00:36:26] So that really hit me hard because I was such a scattered, ding agent in the beginning. And I
[00:36:32] think it was okay in the beginning, but for my life, it wasn't okay. And for other things that are
[00:36:37] really important to me outside of real estate, it was not okay. So now I've got more of a grip on
[00:36:42] that and I'm doing what he says to do. I'm taking Warren Buffett's advice there. That is great,
[00:36:48] a great lesson, a great strategy. And so 100% true with what I've seen is that you really can only
[00:36:57] be good at a couple of things in life anyway. If you really, as you know as an athlete, you know,
[00:37:02] you couldn't probably be as effective as a competitive cyclist versus, oh, I also want to play
[00:37:08] baseball and kind of do those things at the same time. Obviously, that's that'd be almost impossible
[00:37:13] if not impossible to be at the level that you could be if you just focused on one. So I totally
[00:37:19] understand that an athletes do get that they understand they have to sort of put, again, I'm speaking
[00:37:24] as a professional athlete, which I am not, but putting the blinders on and literally just doing
[00:37:29] what's right in front of them that they know is going to guarantee success. And REALTORS have to
[00:37:34] wear a million different hats like you were saying. So it is tough because it isn't a singular. There
[00:37:39] are, oh my gosh, I have to take care of the marketing for my business. I have to take care of
[00:37:44] the customer service. I have to also, these things are flying at me in real time that I have to
[00:37:49] reply to. So it is tough and we acknowledge that challenge. And that's why I suffer from ADHD too.
[00:37:58] So it's like I've got that added element of hardship in which social media now and all the stuff
[00:38:04] you really got to learn the skills to focus on one thing at a time. I love that. It's so funny
[00:38:10] because I think when we talked, whenever I've had a professional athlete on, there's that fantasy
[00:38:17] part of me that goes, they're going to know something. I've never heard before and that's going to
[00:38:22] be the key that our audience is going to be like, ah, that's it. And it's not that those things
[00:38:27] don't exist. It's that they do exist those things and they are what we already know and just need
[00:38:33] to be reminded of, which is fundamentals, discipline, habit, you know, and staying on target and
[00:38:40] have and being coachable, having a coach. Do you find that that you are as coachable today as you
[00:38:47] were when you started and really needed probably more help to get your business off the ground
[00:38:52] than you need today? Are you do you feel like you're just as coachable today as you were then?
[00:38:56] Yeah, I think so. I have to be careful because a continued education is an important part of
[00:39:05] every week of my business. But I got to be careful with there's so many trainings with Compass.
[00:39:10] They have so many trainings. They have the Compass academy and it's limitless. So I have to kind of
[00:39:16] pick and choose. So sometimes I'll do the Mondays. I like the podcast like keeping it real because
[00:39:22] you can sit in your car and going driving from one thing to the next, but it can really eat up a
[00:39:27] lot of your time. So if I can't drive and listen to it, it's kind of a challenge because once I'm in
[00:39:32] the office, I don't have a lot of time to sit there. So I would say my coaching now is our podcast,
[00:39:39] like keeping it real. Those are kind of the momentum Mondays too. They keep me on my toes. But
[00:39:45] I try to grab little golden nuggets here and there and not so much new prospecting ideas, but
[00:39:50] things to say like different strips, different ways to talk to clients and all different types of
[00:39:56] stuff. So it's not just about more prospecting things. There's little things you can learn that
[00:40:02] make a big difference. Like the the Gally had on the other day who did 55 deals in two years that
[00:40:07] she does the VASF Allie forget her last name. Allie VHF. Yeah. Yeah. Allie. I got her checklist and
[00:40:14] you know, we use checklist too. So it's cool to see what the differences were there. But I loved
[00:40:19] her part about the frequently asked question the videos. We're totally going to do that. And we're
[00:40:25] going to we're going to also post them on social media as well just because we're always looking for
[00:40:29] good video content. And so and we you know, I went through that actually went through you you've
[00:40:36] had her on Kim written Berk you can rip her out. Yeah. Yeah. I took her video making course. I'm
[00:40:43] always trying to learn and get better and taking her video making course was great. So kind of
[00:40:48] one thing leads to the next and before you know it you're just like this like amazing top notch
[00:40:53] Reelator that that really knows their stuff and people start to see you as like the expert in the
[00:40:59] field and someone who really knows what they're doing. That's I also want to I want to honor you
[00:41:05] for something you said at the at the beginning which is related to this about being coachable
[00:41:09] is you went to the most successful agents in your area and said, Hey, I'd love to chat with you and
[00:41:15] just get a sense now really what you're doing is going to the competition and saying, Hey,
[00:41:20] tell me what you do differently. So I can learn and you know what the top agent in your area said,
[00:41:25] yeah, I'll tell you because you know she out of the goodness of her heart doesn't see other
[00:41:31] agents as competition. I'm I'm sort of just putting myself in her mind. I could be wrong. But I
[00:41:36] have found that really it is not uncommon that I bring on a top producer who's who gives that
[00:41:41] exact same idea of when I first started I went to the top people and I said, How are you doing this?
[00:41:46] It is and this whole podcast is exactly that idea too. And you know what we I never get a no.
[00:41:52] I mean maybe once in once a year somebody says, I don't really want to talk about talk to
[00:41:57] you know your your audience about what I do. Everyone else is like, yeah, totally just tell everything.
[00:42:02] And understanding that people in their market are also going to hear this and possibly you know be
[00:42:06] more competition for them. But I find that that top agents are typically really really like really
[00:42:12] generous with their time. You're being generous with your time here as well. So I just wanted to give
[00:42:16] you a shout out for for doing that. Yeah, yeah, it's important. I knew it was kind of like the only way
[00:42:23] to you know to really last track. I get I didn't have a lot of time. I had a credit thing going up.
[00:42:29] I had started you know, and so I'm like, I got a what do I need to do? Just tell me people.
[00:42:33] Probably save and you had a you had a time. Yeah, you said you had a three year timeline of being
[00:42:37] a top 20% producer within three years. That is a aggressive aggressive goal. But but you made it.
[00:42:46] And you've continued to do much even much much better than that even. But this idea of that is
[00:42:52] talking to a top producer helps like you said, it's saved you probably years of trial and error.
[00:42:58] Oh, I would assume. Oh yeah, let me tell you every so setting goals are really important.
[00:43:03] Obviously business plans are very important. Every time I've set one of those limits, like I got
[00:43:09] to do it by this point, I've somehow always hit it. And it's like I I even forget about it sometimes.
[00:43:13] But like this year we hit a million GCI. So that was pretty that was amazing. I you know, I wanted to
[00:43:21] do that by 2023. I made that goal like seven or something years ago. I wanted to be the top
[00:43:27] in our office. We hit that. Or I hit that. But the biggest thing. So real quick because I know,
[00:43:35] I know we have limited time. But when you when you talk about like learning from other agents that
[00:43:40] Compass, I've learned from them too because they do statistics and Sky Michaels taught a class on
[00:43:46] business planning, which I teach to my agents now too. And if anybody wants help with business
[00:43:52] planning, I've got the stuff to send to you. So it's part of the power tracker, but I'll send
[00:43:56] the other stuff to. And what we learned from the stats that Compass was producing was that out of the
[00:44:05] it was 95 agents that decided not to follow the business plan. 95% of agents do not follow their
[00:44:12] business plan throughout the year. And 5% do the 5% who did follow their business plan throughout the
[00:44:19] year made as much as the 95% made selling real estate. Wow. So that's really huge data. That's
[00:44:26] pretty impactful information. And it kind of tells you something like business plans are important.
[00:44:32] You know, so there is something kind of invisible and magical about writing down a goal. And like
[00:44:42] you said, maybe not even reviewing it every day, every month, every quarter, maybe not reviewing it
[00:44:47] at all, but getting it written down at least once. There is, and I've seen different stats on
[00:44:52] on goal setting and you never know what to believe or what not to believe, but it certainly can't hurt
[00:44:57] to write down your goals. And even if you never look at them again, but you're right, there is
[00:45:02] something that sometimes like you can't really explain why just writing it down seems to sort of manifest
[00:45:09] it. I mean, there's lots of weird ideas about why you're right. It's weird. It's weird. Like I did
[00:45:15] the Ninja Ninja agent training. I just sell it. Yeah. Yeah. Ninja selling. And that was called
[00:45:21] that years ago. And they had you write down, I will make I will make and I was writing. I know,
[00:45:25] it says, I want to make at the time I put $350,000 a year, I want to make $350,000 and I wrote that
[00:45:32] down and you have to write it down like on like five pages like hundreds of times. I want to make
[00:45:37] $350,000 and just keep writing it. And I did and I did the next year. That's what I did. And it
[00:45:44] was like, it was like exactly that number. It was like within like a thousand bucks. It was
[00:45:49] so I do do that every year now. We write down what we want to make at the start and the business
[00:45:52] plan. And we keep it. And it's so bizarre, but it works. So manifestation, positive energy,
[00:45:59] all that stuff, get your flow going. It's all good. Yeah. It seems to activate something in the
[00:46:04] brain where the brain, you know, again, whatever you believe, whatever anybody believes spiritually or
[00:46:11] philosophically about, you know, you know, we're not here to debate that. But there is something that
[00:46:17] seems to happen. The brain somehow learns that, oh, this is what we're aiming for. And unconsciously
[00:46:23] behind the scenes, it starts to figure out ways to bring that into to one's life. If it's a realistic
[00:46:28] idea, I guess. And it's again, my thought about whether you believe in goal setting or this magical
[00:46:35] things that can happen or not is what's the harm in writing it down, you know, several hundred times.
[00:46:41] I mean, clearly ninja selling is a very well respected training program in this industry. And it's
[00:46:47] not because it doesn't work. It must work to be as successful as it is. So I love that. Thank you.
[00:46:53] For that. I wanted to ask about listing presentations only because at the beginning, you did mention
[00:46:58] that that was a major focus for you was being obsessed with that. Which again is a great thing in
[00:47:03] my mind to be obsessed with because of course, everybody wants listings. And if you are going to
[00:47:09] expect a high close ratio when you have listing appointments, you better have a pretty darn good
[00:47:14] listing presentation because you could make the assumption that every time you go to a listing
[00:47:18] presentation, there's also another agent you might be competing with. It's just a great thing
[00:47:22] to always and you're a competitor. So you're used to competing. So I'm curious about, you know,
[00:47:27] just you don't have to give away all your secrets, of course. But how do you approach a listing
[00:47:32] presentation that you think might be different from your competitors? Yeah, well, you know, you
[00:47:38] have to think about what a seller really needs and wants. And every seller is going to be different.
[00:47:44] I started to learn based off of their personality. So first thing is, as we send out a seller question
[00:47:50] error. And the seller questionnaire is in it. I always send like this pre email before the
[00:47:56] appointment as like a reminder with the seller questionnaire. They fill it out and it gives me a
[00:48:00] really good head start on understanding, you know, things about the house, things about them,
[00:48:04] things about what they want. You know, their needs are the most important thing, right? So if you
[00:48:09] can figure out in the personality test, the disc test, I'm sure a lot of you have heard of the
[00:48:13] disc test, DISSD, learn that study it, do it on yourself, do it on your kids, do it on your
[00:48:20] wife, husband, partner, and really learn how to read people's personalities because that's the
[00:48:27] most important thing. When you get into a listing presentation, it's not about selling yourself
[00:48:31] or your company. It's about when you leave that listing presentation, them saying, man, I like
[00:48:35] that person. I want to be friends with them, but also them feeling like you were able to speak
[00:48:41] their language like they've been heard. So if it's a C type personality, it's going to be more like
[00:48:46] an engineer, a calculator, you know, wants to see stats and numbers. If you can speak that language,
[00:48:51] you're going to make them feel safer. If it's a I to personality, eyes and S is on my favorite,
[00:48:56] because S's are like, you know, nurses or teachers, they're, they're motherly,
[00:49:01] eyes are like, you know, meet everybody at the bar and get their name. They just want to sit
[00:49:05] down and drink tea. All those things are important. And then on top of it, getting better at listening.
[00:49:11] So you can't understand anything about what they need or want if you can't hear what they're saying.
[00:49:16] So listen, and by listening, it gives them, by listening, when you listen more, you control the
[00:49:23] situations. So listening, you get more information. And then last but not least, being able just to
[00:49:29] offer the most value because like it's just like any trade. If you have a painter that comes over and
[00:49:34] says, I'm just going to do it in one coat, it's this price, this and that. Or if you have another
[00:49:38] painter's day, we have a whole team. We're super professional. Your paint job's going to last.
[00:49:42] We do an amazing job. We don't just spray and go. You're going to go with the one, even if they're
[00:49:47] more money, that's more thorough. Gives you more confidence. So that's the same thing. You've got
[00:49:54] to offer value. So for me, I'm lucky with Compass. We offer the company itself gives us the tools to
[00:50:01] offer so much value, starting with Compass Consiers, being able to remodel stuff for the people
[00:50:08] at no expense to them until we close all that stuff. There's so many things. But have your value
[00:50:14] that you offer very clear and easy for them to see. And then the last thing is, I don't have a
[00:50:20] set commission. It's the commission I charge. They have options. So depending on what fits their
[00:50:27] needs, they can choose. The lowest option is still the best option for me. It's still 6%. But
[00:50:35] they have definite options that they can choose from. So I like that too because then you get
[00:50:41] their buy-in. You get their buy-in of, this is what I think makes the most sense for me.
[00:50:46] It's not a one-size-fits-all. It allows people to customize their experience with you.
[00:50:55] And yeah, and actually I always get at least 3%. So it's 5.5% option, 6% option, and a 7%
[00:51:02] option. The lowest I'll get is 3% for listing. Buyer agent always gets 2.5%. But yeah, when you
[00:51:09] give someone an option, there's really no negotiating that has to really happen. They're going to
[00:51:13] just choose one usually by default. And it's all good value. That is a brilliant thought. I am so
[00:51:19] sorry. That didn't even occur to me. When you give somebody an option, you just said something
[00:51:23] very profound. When you give somebody an option, it basically removes the urge to negotiate it.
[00:51:28] I guess people could start technically come back and say, well, let's try to negotiate because
[00:51:34] of course that's what people do in real estate. But it certainly reduces the frequency of those
[00:51:39] kind of conversations. So that is a huge sense of incredibly profound. And by the way, guys,
[00:51:45] this is why when you go to websites and there's usually some sort of software service offering,
[00:51:51] you will almost always see three options. And there is a reason for that. And that it's not because
[00:51:56] we all want three options. It's because the psychology of making decisions knows that three options
[00:52:03] feels optimal to the actual consumer. It feels like they have agency control power over their
[00:52:11] decision making strategy. And it makes them feel more comfortable. So anyway, just wanted to step
[00:52:15] on that for a moment because obviously that is that is I've never heard any of our other guests
[00:52:22] have options for listing clients. And boy, and I imagine maybe on the buy side too. It's brilliant.
[00:52:30] You got to have options. You got to have options in the worst options. Gotta be still very favorable for you.
[00:52:36] And you know, it's I recommend going into negotiating. I was looking it up. It's called the
[00:52:41] C. Ren. It's it's C. R. E. It's basically certified real estate negotiator the C. Ren certification.
[00:52:49] If you take that two hour test class, you'll know everything you need to know about negotiating
[00:52:54] for real estate buyers and sellers. It's easy. I make all my agents do it. It's amazing. So I'm not
[00:52:59] trying to sell their product or anything, but you don't have to do all these years of learning how
[00:53:03] to negotiate. Just take that to our thing. You'll learn all the tricks. And so yeah. I love it.
[00:53:10] Steven, I could talk to you all day. I'm fascinated by you and I are are are similar beings in
[00:53:19] the way we think and act. So I could do go on and on for hours and hours. You don't have that kind
[00:53:24] of time. Managing a team and managing your clients and doing all of the great things that you do
[00:53:29] for your community and and for and by the way, too, you know, we should mention that, you know,
[00:53:35] where Steven lives and practices, you know, Sonoma, Marin County, also, you know, this parts of
[00:53:43] San Francisco Bay. If you are an agent and you have clients, if that's a feeder market for you,
[00:53:50] where clients are either moving from their tea market or vice versa, you know, this is a great
[00:53:55] person to connect with. Maybe you guys can trade referrals. Maybe you guys can develop or and I say
[00:54:01] guys, of course, meaning any agent men and men, men, women or other. So please reach out to Steven if
[00:54:06] you feel that you could add value or if you're looking for a referral partner in that area. I was
[00:54:11] I was at a breakfast yesterday with the top producing team here in Illinois and they are in
[00:54:18] now six markets. They've opened offices and six markets and they talked about the markets where
[00:54:23] they're not they don't have offices and they have such strong relationships with their referral agents
[00:54:29] and partners and you know, they said that that has been the secret to their success because when
[00:54:34] they do refer business, they need to make sure that, you know, that experience is consistent whether
[00:54:40] it's their client or none they refer. So Steven and his his team are are elite top top top white glove
[00:54:48] team. They are among the very very very best in their their market. So please reach out to Steven if
[00:54:56] you feel that you could maybe have a client that that Steven would be of service to or his team.
[00:55:02] Steven, what's the best way an agent who wants to connect with you and also, you know, we talked
[00:55:07] about you have some giveaways for them with respect to some of your processes your power hour,
[00:55:12] which I love. What's the best way just to remind our audience how to get that information from you?
[00:55:18] Yeah, you can email me at s as in Sam and then koza my last name at koza homes homes being plural
[00:55:25] dot com s koza koza homes dot com or you can get me on a Instagram and I'll get to you that way.
[00:55:31] But best way just shoot me an email and I'll get all that stuff out to you and we're also looking
[00:55:35] to refer people in other markets too, you know, the referral business is something that I was
[00:55:39] late to the game on it basically just started building that out about a year ago. Believe it or not.
[00:55:44] So the definitely wanted to network more with other agents.
[00:55:49] Yeah, and find them on social at koza team, which is the handle that you can find most of them.
[00:55:55] We will have links to all of their social channels on our in our show notes.
[00:56:00] And I also just want to make one final observation and this is a a soft skill, but I think a really
[00:56:07] really important one whenever I I'm on with an agent who I can identify this particular skill.
[00:56:13] We haven't talked about it and then I don't know that we need to speak too much about it,
[00:56:16] but I wanted to to to to give you a shout out.
[00:56:20] I want everyone to pay attention to Steven's tonality.
[00:56:23] When he talks does he have a calming presence or does he have an activating presence?
[00:56:30] To me, in my opinion, his voice, his tone, the way he communicates is very calming and relaxing.
[00:56:37] And I will tell you that during real estate transactions, emotions run hot and cold.
[00:56:46] And they I'm not here to say one size fits all that every agent needs to be
[00:56:51] speaking the same manner that Steven speaks, but let's remember how our voices and the way that we
[00:56:57] and communicate how it impacts. Right.
[00:57:00] What we say we know that the data is really clear. What we say, not that important.
[00:57:04] How we say it critically important like 90% of the actual effect of our communication is the
[00:57:09] way in which we say something. So the idea I just wanted to point out that Steven has a very
[00:57:15] calming calming voice and calming presence and you feel relaxed when you're talking with him.
[00:57:21] And I will say that if you don't have that reaction when you're with your clients, you can learn.
[00:57:27] These are skills. This is not well, I was born as an activated person because I'm kind of an
[00:57:31] activated person, but you can learn how to calm down how to relax and realizing how important that is
[00:57:37] to be able to communicate. So Steven, I just wanted to honor you for that. It's maybe it's part of
[00:57:41] the California thing. You've got a little bit of that California relaxed, but obviously as a
[00:57:46] professional athlete, you're a super intense dude. It's not that you're not intense. You're able
[00:57:50] though to focus that intensity in a way that doesn't come across as making your clients anxious,
[00:57:56] or at least making me anxious as the host of the show. So I applaud you for that. It's a soft skill.
[00:58:02] It's probably not something that a lot of people would pay much attention to, but I believe it's
[00:58:09] very important. So you've been a great... That's a good point that you pointed out. I think yes,
[00:58:17] it's... I can be very energetic too for sure, but I think a lot of times working with clients,
[00:58:23] I always tell them, I tell my wife, gosh, I wish I was as good with you as I am with my clients,
[00:58:29] because I go into client mode and then it's like I'm very calm and it is interesting that you
[00:58:34] bring that up. Someone, a coach once told me he said, cut commission out of it. Take it out. If you
[00:58:40] can learn to cut commission out of it and focus on what it's going to take to get them to where they
[00:58:44] want to be and continue to tell your clients that what's it going to take to get you to where you
[00:58:48] want to be, that's what I want to do for you. Stop worrying about the commission because that will come.
[00:58:55] Perfectly said, great place to end up. So everyone reach out to Steve and get some of his
[00:59:00] resources that he is so generously sharing. The same resources he shares with his team and also
[00:59:07] reach out to him if you think you could be a great referral partner. And who knows maybe down the
[00:59:11] road if you're an agent in that local market? Maybe they will be looking for more team members.
[00:59:16] They're not currently right now, but this is obviously the co-sit team is the team to watch because
[00:59:21] they are just crushing it out there. And by the way, he's not in an easy market to compete. He's
[00:59:27] in one of the toughest markets. But that's what a competitor loves. A loves a loves a challenge.
[00:59:32] And you are already there. So congratulations on all your success. I want to say thank you on
[00:59:37] behalf of our audience to Steven and his team for taking time out today to be so generous to help
[00:59:43] our audience. So let's all thank him, sending him some virtual love. But also let him know what
[00:59:50] you thought about his performance on the show, which of course is going to be lots of praise.
[00:59:55] So let him know how great he was here. And also on behalf of Steven and myself, we want to thank
[01:00:01] you, the audience. We want to say thank you for making it to the end of the episode. Please tell
[01:00:05] a friend, think of one other agent that could benefit from this. We know 2023 is tough. This is
[01:00:10] a tough year for every agent out there. Don't let it. Don't let anyone fool you. It's tough. Even the
[01:00:15] ones people that are smiling are working a little harder this year than they normally would be.
[01:00:20] So let's help our fellow agents as well. Rising, what do they say? What's the expression? A rising
[01:00:25] tide raises all ships. So let's help the industry and help me too. Why is well tell other agents about
[01:00:31] the podcast. We appreciate it. And I thank you in advance for that. So tell a friend. And also thank you.
[01:00:39] Let's just say one last time. Thank you to Steven for coming on our show. Steve, it was great
[01:00:44] chatting with you. Such a pleasure. And I hope to have you back in the future. Thank you.
[01:00:49] Thanks so much. Thanks, DJ.

Well, we're excited to have you and really I always love what's such a neat part of this job for me or this, I don't know if it's really a job so much as just a fun thing for me to do. But I get to have conversations with not only people that I think would be interesting to our audience, which of course is the ultimate goal, but interesting to me as well. And I have always been fascinated by people that perform at high levels, whether it's in business, sports, any field really. I'm just always drawn to what I consider to be sort of excellence and skill. And so I'm excited to chat with you and how you were able to take some of those learnings from from your previous career as an athlete. But let's start all the way at the very beginning. Number one, how did you get into real estate or why real estate? Yeah, totally. So, well, I got into this is kind of funny. I got into, I became a professional athlete through cycling. And when I was in school, I never did well in school. I was dyslexic and I struggled there. So I always excelled in sports. It was just where I gravitated to. And my mom grew up, my dad grew up, and baby boomers got to go to college, got to go to college. So it was pretty tough for me to break out of that mold. But it was an avenue for me to not have to go to college, sort of speak. So I really, really, really busted my butt to make it as a professional athlete. I raised in Europe for 10 plus years. And that's what kind of led me into my real estate career in a weird way. Because my mom would always say, invest in a 401k from my cycling invest, did your retirement, did your retirement, and I said, mom, I don't even know the house. Why would I put money into a 401k? I don't have a place to live. I'm renting, so I said, I'm going to save my house. So I said, forget the 401k for a while. I saved my first house. And then just kept going from there. And I started buying more properties, rentals, all while I was racing. So it was kind of an easy transition from when I left cycling to move into a role of wanting to help others do what I had done with real estate. And yeah, so that's how I got into it. And little did I know how much cycling would actually help me with my career in real estate. It was quite incredible. And I look forward to talking about that a bit today. I'm excited to hear about that too. I also curious just because cycling was, you know, I'm 47. And so maybe it's an age thing. But I, and also I grew up in central Illinois, where that just wasn't a sport. It may have been a sport, but it certainly wasn't a known thing where there was like, oh, that's an option. You know, there was football, baseball, basketball. If you were lucky, you had some maybe tennis and golf. If you had the ability to do those kind of sports, or hockey also is in that category. But cycling just wasn't really known to me other than what I would see on TV. So just out of curiosity, how did you even sort of pursue being a professional cyclist? Was that something you knew from an early age that you wanted to do? Was that popular in, in, you know, where you grew up? Just out of curiosity. Yeah, I mean, I moved from, I played ball sports, baseball, soccer. And then it's gotten across country running in high school. I realized that wasn't so good at the ball sports. Better than during sports. And from, during my running years, my friends got me to start mountain biking. And I would take my mom's mountain bike. Before I knew it, I broke it. And she's like, all right, let me get you your own mountain bike. And then they really supported me. I started doing races, started winning. And then in 97, one Lance won his first Tour of France. I said, oh my gosh, I gotta do that. I broke my shoulder in a wrestling accident in high school. And I had to ride on the road for a year. And I transitioned over from there. And got on the national team. So that's kind of how I got into it. Loved from ball sports, the cycling sports. Wow, that's, that's amazing. I guess you're right when Lance did win. He became the biggest athlete in the world, pretty much. Or one of them. And so you're right. That really brought cycling more to the forefront of the average person in this country's awareness of like, oh, this is a thing. And this is a thing where you can have a lot of success. And here's this American just crushing it. So, I was curious. Well, that's amazing. So, I remember to go back to that. I remember there was a friend of mine who's dad was a big cyclist. He told me one day, I was like 15 years old. He said, Stephen, only one in a million can become a professional cyclist. And I, and it always got me when someone told me I couldn't do something. So at that moment, I decided, well, I'm going to prove him wrong. And it kind of rolled over into real estate with that same kind of attitude. Because real estate is a very hard career to make it. And I mean, I never knew it was as hard as it is now that I'm in it. I realized it. When you, when you hear about, you see all these agents posting on their open houses making money here and there, you think it's a lot easier than it is once you're in it. So, you got to have that tenacity. Yeah, I always think like the time, by the time you have a showing or you have a buyer, you've almost already won the hardest part of the business, which is getting clients and getting that to trust you in that purchase or sale. Absolutely. So, I think, yeah, I think you're so right that we, especially on this show too, I have to be very careful because when I talk to really successful teams or agents like yourself, we have both. There could be a tendency for one of our listeners or a lot of our listeners to think like, well, he's already over the hump of the hardest part of this business. Not realizing that maybe the lead generation part becomes a little bit easier over time as you build up a reputation and you get more referrals and you figure out what marketing strategies work. But it's still certainly a grind in a way, meaning like you still have to put in the reps and the hours into this probably in a lot of the same ways that you did when you first started. So, I'm excited to learn about what you learned as an athlete and then taking some of those lessons into real estate. So, can you tell us a little bit about that? Yeah, totally. So, when you jump into real estate, there's different routes you can go. You can get on a team and you can try to maybe you inherited the business or maybe you're working with a parent. I didn't have any of that. Actually, my mom works with me now. She was a teacher for 40 years taught kindergarten and when she retired, I said, hey, come join our real estate team and she's great. She's total natural at it. So, it was kind of the reverse of what you normally see. But so, you have these different routes to take and when you get on a team, being on a team is a great thing. You get a lot of support. But sometimes you don't learn how to necessarily, you don't learn the process of always how to get your own business. So, and when I started, when I went to, it was Frankard Allen at the time. It was the biggest brokerage in the Bay Area. They were around since from 1910 to like 2000 and I think probably 16. They're around for a long time. So, I joined Frankard Allen, but when I interviewed with the, when I met the manager Jim Michaelson, who's actually still the manager of our office today with Compass now, I actually, I had no, I still didn't, I didn't know anything about real estate at all. I'd gotten my license, which doesn't really teach you what you really need to know. In the business. And so, I remember Jim told me later on, he talked to the manager of Frankard Allen and Larry goes, why would you take on a professional athlete? He doesn't, he doesn't, he's not going to be a good, and Jim goes, are you kidding me? If he could be a professional athlete, then he can be a good real estate agent. And Jim was right. And I think that like a lot of the listeners today, something to understand. And, you know, we're always getting pounded over the head with every shiny whistle and every every shiny bell and whistle. This product or this product or this system or this process. But I think it's important to kind of get back to the basics of what makes a good real estate agent. And I studied this when I first got in the business because I studied the best in the business in our area. And I was like, how are they doing this? What makes them so good? And I remember I went to talk to the best REALTOR in our town, year over year, for that she still is for like 40 years. And I said, hey, Peg, how do you do it? Like, what are you doing? What's your secret? And she said, you know what, Steven, there's, there's really no secrets except for this one thing. And she said, consistency. She's consistent, she's consistent with everything she does. And that really stuck with it for me because that's how it was as a professional athlete. It's consistency. And it's following a process. It's following a plan and it's having a coach. I can't stress how important it is to have a coach. And maybe you're not in a position to where you're quite ready to pay for a coach. I think it's a great investment, that gets a great return. But keep listening to keeping a real podcast, things like this, that that is your coach. I mean, you can get carried away with too many things going after too many things. So keep keep your focus when you're you're listening to different podcasts. But have a plan and have a plan that keeps you accountable. And so if anybody listening today wants to have, we have all our agents on the team. They follow it's our power hour tracker. And sometimes it goes more than an hour a day. But it it has the key elements to our success built into it. And then it makes it so that we stay focused during that hour to achieve those things. And then from there, it's like you work with your clients, you're showing properties and so forth, but you start with this. And from there, that's where all your success comes from. So it's our power hour tracker. I'm happy to share that. But to go back to about from cycling to to real estate, I'm very lucky in the fact that I was able to have a career such a cycling because it did give me a little bit of an advantage with knowing you can work your butt off and still get no results. You can pound your head against the wall and still not win a race. Same thing with real estate. And the best real estate agents out there, they're the best at getting back up because they know the sooner they get back up, the sooner they're going to have their next success. And then they're going to annotated wrong as they go. So I obsess over listing presentations. I could not stand how many I lost in the beginning because you know, I'm competing against like pig and so forth. And now I don't lose them. I mean, I just got another one where I was competing against, you know, the top Asian in the town. And I get them at 6%, sometimes I get them at 7%. So it's just it's that whole coaching athlete mentality where you're tweaking your performance, you're tweaking what's going on, you're working with the plan, you're making a better year after year and you're improving on it and the best you can. And not getting down when you get knocked down because let's face it, real estate can be a losing support. And it's not easy. It's very hard, but there's a lot of rewards that come with that that hardness, you know, and it's there's a lot of positives. Otherwise, I wouldn't be doing it. I have a couple of couple of things I want to I want to pause on only because I don't know, no, no, no, you were doing perfect. I just there I had a bunch of thoughts as you were talking because you said a lot of really, really great things there. And I just want to make sure that we we pause and step on them for a little bit for the audience. First of all, you mentioned sharing your power hour information. What's the best way that one of our listeners? And by the way, everybody should do this right now. So I want to say it before I forget what's the best way they could reach out to get that information? For sure. Yeah. Just email me at eska's at homes, talk to the comments the best way you can email me and we'll get it right back to you. Great. We'll have a link to that in the show description and notes as well. Also, this this idea of being coachable, you know, it's something that that I the times I've had athletes on the show like yourself, they've all said this. And it's really important. We sort of forget that every professional athlete, I can't think of an exception to this. I'm probably is one or two, but 99% of professional athletes have coaches, right? Maybe it's 100%. But certainly even the most elite, the people at the very, very, very top of that whatever mountain, you know, particular mountain they're climbing, they still have somebody watching going, oh, you know, maybe do this instead of that and stay on target. And one of the things that reminded me, you talked about getting a coach. And I just wanted to share the suggestion as, well, what if I can't afford a coach right now? And I know there's always that you can't afford not to. Okay, that's fine. But sometimes people literally just can't afford to do it. And so I was thinking of a story, Brian Baphini would tell when he couldn't afford to have a coach or couldn't find one. He, and actually, was a guy here in Chicago. He befriended this guy in Chicago, Joniago. And they were the, each other's accountability partner and Averday they would call each other at night and go, did you win the day? And they had their own, you know, sort of whatever winning the day meant to both of them. And so that was a free thing that they did. And you can certainly at least find somebody in your local market to help with that. But ideally hiring a coach would be sort of, you know, even better than that. I did want to mention just a couple other quick, quick things. I definitely want to ask you about any listing presentation suggestions you might have. We won't go to that quite yet. But I definitely want to hear, you know, how you've become better because you obsess about those. But I also think back to the athlete thing, this idea of failing is, is so scary to us, right? We're afraid of it. It's the reason why we don't pick up phones and, and make certain phone calls. It's, it's the reason that probably holds us back because nobody likes to be rejected. No one likes to fail. Athletes though get a lot of experience not winning because of course that's the pathway to winning is actually failing. And so how important is it to be able to take the L and to, and to not let it defeat you? And, and as you said, it's about getting back up. But how important is it to learn how to I would say, yeah, it's not an easy thing to get comfortable with. It's hard. But the way I look at it, when I get, when I have a loss, I look at what I can do differently and then use it as a positive because you learn from your losses. If you don't have your losses, you're not learning. And, and nothing comes easy. I mean, well, encycling there and, and professional sports, there's always the perform the, the dopeers and stuff that people who are going to cheat in real estate. And I, by the way, I never took performance enhancing drugs. Otherwise, that probably wouldn't need to be selling real estate. But, but it did, it does happen. And with, with real estate, there's no quick way to the top. So you're going to lose. And if you are like on a team and they're giving you all the leads, you're never going to learn how to get them yourself. And if you ever want to go somewhere else, you're not going to have that. So I would say the only one is the hardest way in, in real estate. And it's worth it. And, and through podcasts like this, you're going to learn the systems and, and processes that help you, as far and in a better way. So, well, thank you. By the way, I also forgot to say thank you so much for the wonderful plug you gave just a little bit ago to our, to our show. I am, I am to, to humble sometimes to, to even ask for our audience to participate here with our show. But I appreciate you seeing the value in this and also being of service to our audience and, and sharing. But yeah, I'm sorry, go, go back to, sort of being an athlete. So we understand you have this, we, you know, you're talking about consistency. And, and we can certainly dive into what does that actually look like for you? What are the key? Actually, let's just start there. What are the key behaviors or activities that help, sorry, that are the ones you need to be the most consistent on even today? Have, are those essentially similar to when you started? Are they changed over time? That's a great question. So what is that what is consistency mean? What are the activities and so forth? And how have they changed? So I would say for us, for me, for the team, for, for actually every real estate agent, if, if you're trying something and it's not working, well, a lot of times it's not working because you haven't done it long enough. Well, you need to, you need to stick through it, stick with it. And so I've always, I've always set goals, you know, that my first was going back to cycling. I said, if I don't become a professional cyclist by the time I'm 23, I'm going to have to go to college. So that put this like pressure on me to, to be consistent, to be following the process. And then same with real estate, I said, if I don't, if I'm not making, you know, with the top 20% or making within the first three years of the business, I'm going to stop and I'm going to go to school, become a firefighter. So I put that pressure on myself. And I think the same thing goes with like any prospecting plan that you set out to do, give yourself time and set a reasonable time. So like if my farming this market, farming this neighborhood, if that doesn't provide results within three years, that's what I did. One of my first prospecting thing was farming the neighborhood I lived in. And I still do it to this day of expanded it, of course. But it took me, I would say it took me two, three years before I got a listing or any action from that farm. And guess what I had to do? Every quarter, every quarter, I would hand deliver a thousand printed newsletters and there were 11 by 11 by 17, you know, openfold. And it wasn't just about real estate. This was, you know, it touched on real estate, of course, but it was very community based, very, very localized. We did, in our time, there's a river that comes through it. We did pedal my river cleanups. We did neighborhood garage sale day. So it's like a trail, you know, we're trying to list and you have all the garage sales and it's fun. Like, you know, tons of homes, do it and there's all these garage sales all over the area. We always had, you know, posted the events and things we were doing. So that took me three years before I got business. And now I've made hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars off that farm. I've had sellers come out of that and they've done four or five transactions with me now and they've referred to other people and it's like this tree. I remember I took got my real estate license through John Lomblow. He's not, he's not alive anymore. I mean, it got, it was back in 2012. It was practically, I think we're using VHS tapes to do it. But he said, he said, do something and start off with a farm. And I know it sounds old fashioned, but I'm telling you, it's connecting and I would just hand drop under the mats. I would not knock on doors. It's a thousand homes, right? Walking them. Now we mail. But I still think that connection being out in the community, I met so many people while I was doing that. So consistency. Don't give up. Well, I want to point out this idea because I was, you had mentioned that you were handing them out and then you were mentioning there's other ways too, which you were participating in the community doing volunteer efforts, you know, helping garage sales and, you know, just just anything you can do to get your name out there. And at the same time, hand delivering a thousand, a thousand, you know, newsletters, which were, which was actually, I like the idea that you did them bigger than the standard size too. Just makes it a little bit, you know, more interesting to hold and sort of harder to immediately throw away maybe. But the idea of putting the work in is, you know, I, I'm hearing just obviously as professional athlete, you're putting in a lot of reps, you're, you're practicing, you're practicing fundamentals and, and advanced strategies too. But always going back to those, you know, cycling is no, well, I know nothing about cycling personally, but I'm assuming it's no different from so many other sports where it's just a lot of practice, of course. So it's kind of even a silly thing to, to reflect on. But the idea of, of just repetition and reps, doing the reps and, and seeing those. And then, and then by the way, not looking at it a year in going, you know, no results, I've got nothing. And you're like, I still got to stand out a thousand more of these next month. And I'm going to keep doing it until I get results because obviously we know that that pathway should work over time. We know that it's not, it's not really a risky thing. It's just a lot of, a lot of time, a lot of effort. And, and, and it worked out for you hundreds of thousands of dollars in commissions. And it's also something that, as an athlete, you just get, you understand the work that's, that's needed. So this is just like putting in your, your reps at the gym. Totally. And when I started that far, I, I'd ran it up on a credit card, but I'll tell you it, I mean, printing is so cheap, you know, you print a thousand brochures. It's super cheap. And John Lomblow said, you know, he said quality over quantity, you know, so he said his thing was go to 250 homes around you and not and really established those connections. I'm not a real knock or cold call kind of, I just, I know I need to move in that direction. I need to become more personal or more forward, but I'm definitely, I don't want to, I don't like when people knock on my door. So I don't really want to do it. And, you know, it, it just worked the way I did it. And so, but yeah, like you said, repetition. And here's another really important thing. You only can do so much. My coach would always tell me he said the best, the best REALTORS in the business, they have three to five prospecting methods. He said, Steven, start off with two to three, build them out, build a fence around them. So they're like their own little ecosystem. They're working for them, you know, for you. And then you can add on more, but first build them out and surround it, make it bomb proof and then go to your next one. And not all prospecting methods have to cost money either. So, you know, speaking to like social media there. So if you're new in the business and you're, you're, you know, you don't have a lot of farms, you know, own, own the social media world, you know, that can, that alone, that, and of course, open houses, that's a given. But as far as the print stuff, you just got to think about the return on your investment. You know, if you get one deal, is it going to cover, you know, and then how many deals you're going to get over time of, you know, course your career. So yeah, those are really, really great strategies. And also too, like the idea of doing these volunteer, you know, community outreach kind of programs, oftentimes can be low cost to no cost, right? Like if you're offering to volunteer, you're going to clean up, you know, like a river or some waterway or, you know, a stretch of the highway or, or anything or volunteering at a local, you know, shelter or whatever, those things are, are usually low cost because if you do invite your, your audience, I went to, sorry, interrupted myself, but I went to one of the very best of those that I've witnessed. It was a Compass agent of all, of all things I hear in Chicago. By the way, I also want to do a quick plug for something. And I can't remember the gentleman's name who, who runs it. But if you are a Compass agent, and we know there's a lot of you that listen because we've had a million Compass agents on our show because they're just, you know, taking over. But there's a great thing called the 6am or club, which, yeah, which, and I, the gentleman that runs it. Sky Michaels. Sky Michaels. Yeah, he's great. He does momentum Monday too. So he's a free coach for Compass. And I've gotten so many golden nuggets from him. It's incredible. And, and little plug for my interview with Sky Michaels. Just one of the, one of the neatest guys I've ever had on our show. And if you're a Compass person, please take advantage of that. You're very lucky to have, not you, Steven, but the company's very lucky to have sky. So please check out the 6am or club. Also, maybe if you're interested in, and not that I get paid to promote Compass as a company, but a good reason to consider them. If you need some accountability, they've got a fun little way to do that. So anyway, but back, back, of course, to Steven, I, we, I'd be remiss if we didn't mention your, your amazing team as well. It's not just you, you, you, you go a wonderful group of people around you. Can you tell us a little bit about the team and, and sort of why you developed one? Absolutely. Real quick. Back to that, the newsletter. This is just in the volunteering thing. This is just a very basic thing. But this shows you the power of that farm. You can take a great non-profit in the area and you can go to them. So like we have mentor me or relief pet alumna. And you can say, hey, mentor me. What are some, what's a fundraiser coming up for something that we can promote in our newsletter for you? And we do it for free. You know, and then of course, so that's great because you're, you're doing something different. You're, you're, our whole Y is giving back, you know, our team Y. And so you're connecting with this whole organization by promoting them. And now our newsletter goes that to 10,000 homes. So these, these charities, these people are really benefiting from what we're doing. So it's like, it's like killing two birds with one stone, right? And so we always try to do that. We also have our deferred lender. He advertises in it. He's got his little section. So he helps pay for it. So think of stuff like that. You're going to have service providers pay for a lot of stuff. So yeah, about the team. Having a team has been a huge thing for the Coz team, of course, like turning it into that has made a big difference in my life. And then of course, in their lives as well. I, I was a workaholic the first, I would say, there's a being in the business. I ended up going through a divorce. It really taxed my life. And that was obviously my own choice to be a workaholic. I could have, you know, backed it down. But my coach, when I finally had a good coach, he taught me how to have systems and how to build a team. And so we've got our market. The first person I hired was a marketing person. And I don't know if that's very common, but I realized, well, you know, I can handle working with clients, but the back end marketing stuff, the social media, all that. That's where we're getting our dips in business. So we hired a marketing lady who now has a real estate license and our business more than doubled after that. Like that, it totally, it doubled. That was the year of business doubled. So, did you know that that was, did you know that hiring a marketing person was, you know, that or not not hiring a market, but identifying that that was that that's where the whole was in in the business to fill that that you can't do everything and be everything as as a solo practitioner. Obviously, there's going to be things that you enjoy doing or that you're good at and other things that aren't necessarily easy for you to do or that you want to do. Totally. Yeah, it was the consistency thing. I kept going back to what Peg told me in the beginning, you got to be consistent. And that's where I was, I was lacking was the consistency with my, with the marketing, the prospecting, with the stuff that I didn't do personally. And my coach said, well, calculate how much you make an hour, you know, find out what you make an hour. And then ask yourself if it's worth spending your time on that. And if it's not, then hire someone to do it. That was really, I would say, a change in point in my career was when I started treating my business like a business, because far often too many times us agents, we get stuck in the business. We got to, we got to step out of it and work on our business. So, I recommend anybody listening, taking our day, you can always find after you do your power hour before you do your power, spend an hour, two, so there's two hours there now, spend an hour working on your business, not in your business. And once you start working on your business on a daily basis, that's where you're going to start seeing a lot of growth because you're not going to be stuck in it. When you're stuck in it, that's when you start to see these big dips and slow periods. But when you, when you really work on your business, that's where you start to grow and consistently have business. That's what I realized at least. I remember learning in college, there's a Steven Covey book. I can't remember if it's first things first or highly, you know, habits of highly successful people. Whatever it was, he had this matrix that I thought was something's very hard to do, I think for me, but really, really important that I think sort of speaks to what you just said, which is he called it the urgency versus importance matrix, which is really just four, four boxes, you know, something comes at you, you put it in one of these four boxes and that gives you an idea of how and when to respond to it. So it's just because something flies at you in the form of an email, a text, a phone call, doesn't necessarily mean at its urgent. It means it feels urgent because it just came in, we see it, where, you know, our brains are wired to want to fix solve problems, but it doesn't necessarily mean it's the best course of action at that particular time. And you just sort of run it through a like, how important is this, how urgent is it? And then you decide when and when to respond back to it. I imagine as an athlete, you were constantly having to evaluate, you know, especially, you know, while you're racing, you know, what's important, what's urgent, what do I need to take action on now, what adjustments do I need to make? And there's probably, you probably also learn just really great decision-making strategies when you're competing at that level. It's all about making decisions in the moment that are best for you, best for the team. Can you talk a little bit about under, you know, when things fly at you, how do you sort of determine this? I got to reply to right away or this, this can hold off, even though this might seem urgent in the moment. How do I, you know, how do you make those decisions? Well, I got to tell you, I'm still kind of learning that in real estate in cycling. It was pretty easy and because it was one focus, it's like everything's for cycling. It was real estate, everything's for real estate, but there's volunteering, there's this, there's that, there's all these different things that call for your attention or, you know, trying to do too much. And so I'm still learning that, but something that I recently heard, Warren Buffett said, well, he, so the story goes, he was in his private jet and the pilot, his pilot asked him, hey, Warren, how do you prioritize your time? And Warren goes well to the j... Most 25 things to you in your life. Cheating you want to be a better father, you want to be better at selling real estate, you want to be healthier, more, you know, more fitness. Take 25 of those things and make a list of it. And then Warren goes, okay, now that you have that list of 25 things, take five of them, take the top five of those 25 and make a list of the top five. And then now Warren goes, okay, now that you have the top five things you want to achieve or do or be in your life, take those other 20 things and throw them. Because life is finite. We have enough time. He says, if you can just focus on those five things, you're going to do the best you can at them and maybe by the time you die, you'll be able to achieve them. Maybe you won't, but at least you're going to know you did your best. But if you have the other 20 there, you're not going to be good at anything. So that really hit me hard because I was such a scattered, ding agent in the beginning. And I think it was okay in the beginning, but for my life, it wasn't okay. And for other things that are really important to me outside of real estate, it was not okay. So now I've got more of a grip on that and I'm doing what he says to do. I'm taking Warren Buffett's advice there. That is great, a great lesson, a great strategy. And so 100% true with what I've seen is that you really can only be good at a couple of things in life anyway. If you really, as you know as an athlete, you know, you couldn't probably be as effective as a competitive cyclist versus, oh, I also want to play baseball and kind of do those things at the same time. Obviously, that's that'd be almost impossible if not impossible to be at the level that you could be if you just focused on one. So I totally understand that an athletes do get that they understand they have to sort of put, again, I'm speaking as a professional athlete, which I am not, but putting the blinders on and literally just doing what's right in front of them that they know is going to guarantee success. And REALTORS have to wear a million different hats like you were saying. So it is tough because it isn't a singular. There are, oh my gosh, I have to take care of the marketing for my business. I have to take care of the customer service. I have to also, these things are flying at me in real time that I have to reply to. So it is tough and we acknowledge that challenge. And that's why I suffer from ADHD too. So it's like I've got that added element of hardship in which social media now and all the stuff you really got to learn the skills to focus on one thing at a time. I love that. It's so funny because I think when we talked, whenever I've had a professional athlete on, there's that fantasy part of me that goes, they're going to know something. I've never heard before and that's going to be the key that our audience is going to be like, ah, that's it. And it's not that those things don't exist. It's that they do exist those things and they are what we already know and just need to be reminded of, which is fundamentals, discipline, habit, you know, and staying on target and have and being coachable, having a coach. Do you find that that you are as coachable today as you were when you started and really needed probably more help to get your business off the ground than you need today? Are you do you feel like you're just as coachable today as you were then? Yeah, I think so. I have to be careful because a continued education is an important part of every week of my business. But I got to be careful with there's so many trainings with Compass. They have so many trainings. They have the Compass academy and it's limitless. So I have to kind of pick and choose. So sometimes I'll do the Mondays. I like the podcast like keeping it real because you can sit in your car and going driving from one thing to the next, but it can really eat up a lot of your time. So if I can't drive and listen to it, it's kind of a challenge because once I'm in the office, I don't have a lot of time to sit there. So I would say my coaching now is our podcast, like keeping it real. Those are kind of the momentum Mondays too. They keep me on my toes. But I try to grab little golden nuggets here and there and not so much new prospecting ideas, but things to say like different strips, different ways to talk to clients and all different types of stuff. So it's not just about more prospecting things. There's little things you can learn that make a big difference. Like the the Gally had on the other day who did 55 deals in two years that she does the VASF Allie forget her last name. Allie VHF. Yeah. Yeah. Allie. I got her checklist and you know, we use checklist too. So it's cool to see what the differences were there. But I loved her part about the frequently asked question the videos. We're totally going to do that. And we're going to we're going to also post them on social media as well just because we're always looking for good video content. And so and we you know, I went through that actually went through you you've had her on Kim written Berk you can rip her out. Yeah. Yeah. I took her video making course. I'm always trying to learn and get better and taking her video making course was great. So kind of one thing leads to the next and before you know it you're just like this like amazing top notch Reelator that that really knows their stuff and people start to see you as like the expert in the field and someone who really knows what they're doing. That's I also want to I want to honor you for something you said at the at the beginning which is related to this about being coachable is you went to the most successful agents in your area and said, Hey, I'd love to chat with you and just get a sense now really what you're doing is going to the competition and saying, Hey, tell me what you do differently. So I can learn and you know what the top agent in your area said, yeah, I'll tell you because you know she out of the goodness of her heart doesn't see other agents as competition. I'm I'm sort of just putting myself in her mind. I could be wrong. But I have found that really it is not uncommon that I bring on a top producer who's who gives that exact same idea of when I first started I went to the top people and I said, How are you doing this? It is and this whole podcast is exactly that idea too. And you know what we I never get a no. I mean maybe once in once a year somebody says, I don't really want to talk about talk to you know your your audience about what I do. Everyone else is like, yeah, totally just tell everything. And understanding that people in their market are also going to hear this and possibly you know be more competition for them. But I find that that top agents are typically really really like really generous with their time. You're being generous with your time here as well. So I just wanted to give you a shout out for for doing that. Yeah, yeah, it's important. I knew it was kind of like the only way to you know to really last track. I get I didn't have a lot of time. I had a credit thing going up. I had started you know, and so I'm like, I got a what do I need to do? Just tell me people. Probably save and you had a you had a time. Yeah, you said you had a three year timeline of being a top 20% producer within three years. That is a aggressive aggressive goal. But but you made it. And you've continued to do much even much much better than that even. But this idea of that is talking to a top producer helps like you said, it's saved you probably years of trial and error. Oh, I would assume. Oh yeah, let me tell you every so setting goals are really important. Obviously business plans are very important. Every time I've set one of those limits, like I got to do it by this point, I've somehow always hit it. And it's like I I even forget about it sometimes. But like this year we hit a million GCI. So that was pretty that was amazing. I you know, I wanted to do that by 2023. I made that goal like seven or something years ago. I wanted to be the top in our office. We hit that. Or I hit that. But the biggest thing. So real quick because I know, I know we have limited time. But when you when you talk about like learning from other agents that Compass, I've learned from them too because they do statistics and Sky Michaels taught a class on business planning, which I teach to my agents now too. And if anybody wants help with business planning, I've got the stuff to send to you. So it's part of the power tracker, but I'll send the other stuff to. And what we learned from the stats that Compass was producing was that out of the it was 95 agents that decided not to follow the business plan. 95% of agents do not follow their business plan throughout the year. And 5% do the 5% who did follow their business plan throughout the year made as much as the 95% made selling real estate. Wow. So that's really huge data. That's pretty impactful information. And it kind of tells you something like business plans are important. You know, so there is something kind of invisible and magical about writing down a goal. And like you said, maybe not even reviewing it every day, every month, every quarter, maybe not reviewing it at all, but getting it written down at least once. There is, and I've seen different stats on on goal setting and you never know what to believe or what not to believe, but it certainly can't hurt to write down your goals. And even if you never look at them again, but you're right, there is something that sometimes like you can't really explain why just writing it down seems to sort of manifest it. I mean, there's lots of weird ideas about why you're right. It's weird. It's weird. Like I did the Ninja Ninja agent training. I just sell it. Yeah. Yeah. Ninja selling. And that was called that years ago. And they had you write down, I will make I will make and I was writing. I know, it says, I want to make at the time I put $350,000 a year, I want to make $350,000 and I wrote that down and you have to write it down like on like five pages like hundreds of times. I want to make $350,000 and just keep writing it. And I did and I did the next year. That's what I did. And it was like, it was like exactly that number. It was like within like a thousand bucks. It was so I do do that every year now. We write down what we want to make at the start and the business plan. And we keep it. And it's so bizarre, but it works. So manifestation, positive energy, all that stuff, get your flow going. It's all good. Yeah. It seems to activate something in the brain where the brain, you know, again, whatever you believe, whatever anybody believes spiritually or philosophically about, you know, you know, we're not here to debate that. But there is something that seems to happen. The brain somehow learns that, oh, this is what we're aiming for. And unconsciously behind the scenes, it starts to figure out ways to bring that into to one's life. If it's a realistic idea, I guess. And it's again, my thought about whether you believe in goal setting or this magical things that can happen or not is what's the harm in writing it down, you know, several hundred times. I mean, clearly ninja selling is a very well respected training program in this industry. And it's not because it doesn't work. It must work to be as successful as it is. So I love that. Thank you. For that. I wanted to ask about listing presentations only because at the beginning, you did mention that that was a major focus for you was being obsessed with that. Which again is a great thing in my mind to be obsessed with because of course, everybody wants listings. And if you are going to expect a high close ratio when you have listing appointments, you better have a pretty darn good listing presentation because you could make the assumption that every time you go to a listing presentation, there's also another agent you might be competing with. It's just a great thing to always and you're a competitor. So you're used to competing. So I'm curious about, you know, just you don't have to give away all your secrets, of course. But how do you approach a listing presentation that you think might be different from your competitors? Yeah, well, you know, you have to think about what a seller really needs and wants. And every seller is going to be different. I started to learn based off of their personality. So first thing is, as we send out a seller question error. And the seller questionnaire is in it. I always send like this pre email before the appointment as like a reminder with the seller questionnaire. They fill it out and it gives me a really good head start on understanding, you know, things about the house, things about them, things about what they want. You know, their needs are the most important thing, right? So if you can figure out in the personality test, the disc test, I'm sure a lot of you have heard of the disc test, DISSD, learn that study it, do it on yourself, do it on your kids, do it on your wife, husband, partner, and really learn how to read people's personalities because that's the most important thing. When you get into a listing presentation, it's not about selling yourself or your company. It's about when you leave that listing presentation, them saying, man, I like that person. I want to be friends with them, but also them feeling like you were able to speak their language like they've been heard. So if it's a C type personality, it's going to be more like an engineer, a calculator, you know, wants to see stats and numbers. If you can speak that language, you're going to make them feel safer. If it's a I to personality, eyes and S is on my favorite, because S's are like, you know, nurses or teachers, they're, they're motherly, eyes are like, you know, meet everybody at the bar and get their name. They just want to sit down and drink tea. All those things are important. And then on top of it, getting better at listening. So you can't understand anything about what they need or want if you can't hear what they're saying. So listen, and by listening, it gives them, by listening, when you listen more, you control the situations. So listening, you get more information. And then last but not least, being able just to offer the most value because like it's just like any trade. If you have a painter that comes over and says, I'm just going to do it in one coat, it's this price, this and that. Or if you have another painter's day, we have a whole team. We're super professional. Your paint job's going to last. We do an amazing job. We don't just spray and go. You're going to go with the one, even if they're more money, that's more thorough. Gives you more confidence. So that's the same thing. You've got to offer value. So for me, I'm lucky with Compass. We offer the company itself gives us the tools to offer so much value, starting with Compass Consiers, being able to remodel stuff for the people at no expense to them until we close all that stuff. There's so many things. But have your value that you offer very clear and easy for them to see. And then the last thing is, I don't have a set commission. It's the commission I charge. They have options. So depending on what fits their needs, they can choose. The lowest option is still the best option for me. It's still 6%. But they have definite options that they can choose from. So I like that too because then you get their buy-in. You get their buy-in of, this is what I think makes the most sense for me. It's not a one-size-fits-all. It allows people to customize their experience with you. And yeah, and actually I always get at least 3%. So it's 5.5% option, 6% option, and a 7% option. The lowest I'll get is 3% for listing. Buyer agent always gets 2.5%. But yeah, when you give someone an option, there's really no negotiating that has to really happen. They're going to just choose one usually by default. And it's all good value. That is a brilliant thought. I am so sorry. That didn't even occur to me. When you give somebody an option, you just said something very profound. When you give somebody an option, it basically removes the urge to negotiate it. I guess people could start technically come back and say, well, let's try to negotiate because of course that's what people do in real estate. But it certainly reduces the frequency of those kind of conversations. So that is a huge sense of incredibly profound. And by the way, guys, this is why when you go to websites and there's usually some sort of software service offering, you will almost always see three options. And there is a reason for that. And that it's not because we all want three options. It's because the psychology of making decisions knows that three options feels optimal to the actual consumer. It feels like they have agency control power over their decision making strategy. And it makes them feel more comfortable. So anyway, just wanted to step on that for a moment because obviously that is that is I've never heard any of our other guests have options for listing clients. And boy, and I imagine maybe on the buy side too. It's brilliant. You got to have options. You got to have options in the worst options. Gotta be still very favorable for you. And you know, it's I recommend going into negotiating. I was looking it up. It's called the C. Ren. It's it's C. R. E. It's basically certified real estate negotiator the C. Ren certification. If you take that two hour test class, you'll know everything you need to know about negotiating for real estate buyers and sellers. It's easy. I make all my agents do it. It's amazing. So I'm not trying to sell their product or anything, but you don't have to do all these years of learning how to negotiate. Just take that to our thing. You'll learn all the tricks. And so yeah. I love it. Steven, I could talk to you all day. I'm fascinated by you and I are are are similar beings in the way we think and act. So I could do go on and on for hours and hours. You don't have that kind of time. Managing a team and managing your clients and doing all of the great things that you do for your community and and for and by the way, too, you know, we should mention that, you know, where Steven lives and practices, you know, Sonoma, Marin County, also, you know, this parts of San Francisco Bay. If you are an agent and you have clients, if that's a feeder market for you, where clients are either moving from their tea market or vice versa, you know, this is a great person to connect with. Maybe you guys can trade referrals. Maybe you guys can develop or and I say guys, of course, meaning any agent men and men, men, women or other. So please reach out to Steven if you feel that you could add value or if you're looking for a referral partner in that area. I was I was at a breakfast yesterday with the top producing team here in Illinois and they are in now six markets. They've opened offices and six markets and they talked about the markets where they're not they don't have offices and they have such strong relationships with their referral agents and partners and you know, they said that that has been the secret to their success because when they do refer business, they need to make sure that, you know, that experience is consistent whether it's their client or none they refer. So Steven and his his team are are elite top top top white glove team. They are among the very very very best in their their market. So please reach out to Steven if you feel that you could maybe have a client that that Steven would be of service to or his team. Steven, what's the best way an agent who wants to connect with you and also, you know, we talked about you have some giveaways for them with respect to some of your processes your power hour, which I love. What's the best way just to remind our audience how to get that information from you? Yeah, you can email me at s as in Sam and then koza my last name at koza homes homes being plural dot com s koza koza homes dot com or you can get me on a Instagram and I'll get to you that way. But best way just shoot me an email and I'll get all that stuff out to you and we're also looking to refer people in other markets too, you know, the referral business is something that I was late to the game on it basically just started building that out about a year ago. Believe it or not. So the definitely wanted to network more with other agents. Yeah, and find them on social at koza team, which is the handle that you can find most of them. We will have links to all of their social channels on our in our show notes. And I also just want to make one final observation and this is a a soft skill, but I think a really really important one whenever I I'm on with an agent who I can identify this particular skill. We haven't talked about it and then I don't know that we need to speak too much about it, but I wanted to to to to give you a shout out. I want everyone to pay attention to Steven's tonality. When he talks does he have a calming presence or does he have an activating presence? To me, in my opinion, his voice, his tone, the way he communicates is very calming and relaxing. And I will tell you that during real estate transactions, emotions run hot and cold. And they I'm not here to say one size fits all that every agent needs to be speaking the same manner that Steven speaks, but let's remember how our voices and the way that we and communicate how it impacts. Right. What we say we know that the data is really clear. What we say, not that important. How we say it critically important like 90% of the actual effect of our communication is the way in which we say something. So the idea I just wanted to point out that Steven has a very calming calming voice and calming presence and you feel relaxed when you're talking with him. And I will say that if you don't have that reaction when you're with your clients, you can learn. These are skills. This is not well, I was born as an activated person because I'm kind of an activated person, but you can learn how to calm down how to relax and realizing how important that is to be able to communicate. So Steven, I just wanted to honor you for that. It's maybe it's part of the California thing. You've got a little bit of that California relaxed, but obviously as a professional athlete, you're a super intense dude. It's not that you're not intense. You're able though to focus that intensity in a way that doesn't come across as making your clients anxious, or at least making me anxious as the host of the show. So I applaud you for that. It's a soft skill. It's probably not something that a lot of people would pay much attention to, but I believe it's very important. So you've been a great... That's a good point that you pointed out. I think yes, it's... I can be very energetic too for sure, but I think a lot of times working with clients, I always tell them, I tell my wife, gosh, I wish I was as good with you as I am with my clients, because I go into client mode and then it's like I'm very calm and it is interesting that you bring that up. Someone, a coach once told me he said, cut commission out of it. Take it out. If you can learn to cut commission out of it and focus on what it's going to take to get them to where they want to be and continue to tell your clients that what's it going to take to get you to where you want to be, that's what I want to do for you. Stop worrying about the commission because that will come. Perfectly said, great place to end up. So everyone reach out to Steve and get some of his resources that he is so generously sharing. The same resources he shares with his team and also reach out to him if you think you could be a great referral partner. And who knows maybe down the road if you're an agent in that local market? Maybe they will be looking for more team members. They're not currently right now, but this is obviously the co-sit team is the team to watch because they are just crushing it out there. And by the way, he's not in an easy market to compete. He's in one of the toughest markets. But that's what a competitor loves. A loves a loves a challenge. And you are already there. So congratulations on all your success. I want to say thank you on behalf of our audience to Steven and his team for taking time out today to be so generous to help our audience. So let's all thank him, sending him some virtual love. But also let him know what you thought about his performance on the show, which of course is going to be lots of praise. So let him know how great he was here. And also on behalf of Steven and myself, we want to thank you, the audience. We want to say thank you for making it to the end of the episode. Please tell a friend, think of one other agent that could benefit from this. We know 2023 is tough. This is a tough year for every agent out there. Don't let it. Don't let anyone fool you. It's tough. Even the ones people that are smiling are working a little harder this year than they normally would be. So let's help our fellow agents as well. Rising, what do they say? What's the expression? A rising tide raises all ships. So let's help the industry and help me too. Why is well tell other agents about the podcast. We appreciate it. And I thank you in advance for that. So tell a friend. And also thank you. Let's just say one last time. Thank you to Steven for coming on our show. Steve, it was great chatting with you. Such a pleasure. And I hope to have you back in the future. Thank you. Thanks so much. Thanks, DJ.
