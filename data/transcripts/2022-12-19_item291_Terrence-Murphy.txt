[00:02:31] My conversation with Terrence Murphy.
[00:02:43] Today on the show at Terrence Murphy from eXp in Texas, let me tell you all about Terrence.
[00:02:51] Now Terrence was a second round NFL draft pick by the Green Bay Packers after graduating
[00:02:56] from Texas A&M University as a three time academic all big 12 student athlete.
[00:03:03] Now Terrence, this is amazing.
[00:03:04] Has broker it.
[00:03:05] If that wasn't amazing enough, Terrence has brokered 1.1 billion in sales volume over
[00:03:11] the last 10 years.
[00:03:12] He currently owns 20 companies, actually more than 20 companies, under the Terrence Murphy
[00:03:17] company's brand.
[00:03:18] And Terrence is an investor in more than 30 companies as a venture capitalist.
[00:03:23] Now investing in real estate is one of the things he is most passionate about as he currently
[00:03:27] owns over 400 beds of residential real estate and commercial properties all over the US.
[00:03:34] Terrence is also a two time winner of Inc. 5,000 award for America's fastest growing privately
[00:03:41] owned businesses and also is a three time recipient of the Texas A&M Mays Business School
[00:03:46] Aggie 100 or 100 fastest growing businesses in the world.
[00:03:51] Terrence possesses the same traits that he portrayed on the football field, which is
[00:03:55] integrity, passion, hard work, dedication, loyalty, desire to succeed and excellence,
[00:04:02] all of which help his business continue.
[00:04:04] His businesses continue to grow and his clients to receive superior service to learn all
[00:04:11] about Terrence.
[00:04:12] And by the way, he has a podcast that he just launched as well because of course he does
[00:04:15] he does everything.
[00:04:16] But I want you to learn all about Terrence at his website, which is Terrence Murphy.
[00:04:20] I'm going to spell Terrence because it can be spelled many different ways.
[00:04:23] It's in by the way, we're also going to have a link to this in the show notes.

[00:04:46] Terrence, welcome to the show.
[00:04:48] Man, appreciate it.
[00:04:48] Man, sorry about the long intro.
[00:04:50] My team sent you.
[00:04:51] But at the same time, they always laugh because they're like, well, how are you doing so much?
[00:04:54] We have to make the intro, I saw it.
[00:04:56] So it's fun, man.
[00:04:57] Thank you.
[00:04:57] Great job.
[00:04:58] Thank you.
[00:04:59] No, thank you.
[00:05:00] And I love reading long intros like that.
[00:05:03] Well, sometimes people it is funny.
[00:05:05] Sometimes people we interview will send us things that we have to pair down because they're
[00:05:09] like, OK, nobody cares about this and that.
[00:05:11] Everything that you guys sent over was things I'm like, I have to talk about all of this
[00:05:15] because this I think it was very concise.
[00:05:17] You just do a lot.
[00:05:19] And I think that I'd love to talk to you about the fact that you run so many different
[00:05:24] businesses, you have so many different interests.
[00:05:27] You're a busy, busy guy.
[00:05:29] And at the same time, running the successful real estate practice.
[00:05:32] But before we get to sort of where you are today, I'd love to learn a little bit more
[00:05:36] about how you got to where you are today.
[00:05:38] So I love our audience to hear about your football career and then how you transitioned
[00:05:43] into real estate.
[00:05:45] Yeah, man.
[00:05:46] So born and raised in East Texas grew up with a single mom.
[00:05:52] And so for all the kids that grew up with single moms, for all you real estate agents that
[00:05:57] are single moms, I love you.
[00:05:58] And I'm proud of you.
[00:06:00] And so yeah, I just grew up with a single mom.
[00:06:02] She put a lot into me, encouraged me, pushed me, and was very hard on me.
[00:06:07] And that's the way that I've become who I am.
[00:06:11] As an entrepreneur and as a student athlete and as a professional athlete.
[00:06:16] And then just having the heart to help, right?
[00:06:18] Because I've lived that life where we went not having everything.
[00:06:23] And so I just have the mentality to try to help them.
[00:06:26] We talked about early DJ life is like a boomerang, right?
[00:06:30] What you put out, you get back.
[00:06:31] And not only do you get it back, you get it back with precision.
[00:06:34] And so for many years, I've encouraged real estate agents.
[00:06:37] I've coached them.
[00:06:38] I've pushed them.
[00:06:39] I've given them tools.
[00:06:40] And now I've been able to see the benefits from those seeds that I set as people
[00:06:46] that started to join my organization at eXp, like crazy.
[00:06:50] So it's been cool.
[00:06:51] But yeah, that's grew up there.
[00:06:53] Went to Tixan M, football scholarship.
[00:06:55] I drafted by the Green Bay Packers with Aaron Rogers.
[00:06:58] And back to back in the film, he pees as my roommate, my bro.
[00:07:01] And he's killing the game.
[00:07:02] And then I retired and moved into real estate.
[00:07:06] And just grew a passion for it.
[00:07:08] And to start off as a developer and investor, got my license with the killer Williams
[00:07:12] for a year, which we all do.
[00:07:14] Left up rings, started an independent brokerage T and five.
[00:07:17] I told people I was going to scale my independent startup brokerage.
[00:07:21] This was in my early 20s with no experience.
[00:07:23] I did seven transactions when I started T and five.
[00:07:26] And I said, I'm going to scale it to a billion sales in ten years.
[00:07:28] I actually did it in eight.
[00:07:30] And people were like, there's no way you're in a small town.
[00:07:32] It's not possible.
[00:07:33] You need a franchise.
[00:07:34] And we did.
[00:07:35] And that's that's how I got in real estate after retiring from the NFL.
[00:07:38] It's it's incredible.
[00:07:40] And I know you're skipping over about a million steps along the way.
[00:07:43] But I love the fact that that here you are.
[00:07:47] And this idea of scaling is so, so important,
[00:07:51] especially now where I see agents flocking to teams.
[00:07:55] Teams have become more and more important, more and more prevalent, more and more attractive.
[00:08:01] I think over the years.
[00:08:02] And we're seeing this flock to teams and I'm hearing, well, I'm interviewing a lot of people
[00:08:07] for the show and also just here for our brokerage in Chicago that are struggling with scaling,
[00:08:13] trying to figure out how do I go from being like an individual producer to running a team,
[00:08:18] then to scaling the team.
[00:08:20] And those are different skill sets.
[00:08:23] And was that difficult for you to go for, you know, you, well, you said you,
[00:08:26] you were just done seven transactions.
[00:08:27] You're like, I'm building a team.
[00:08:29] I'm going to, I'm going to scale this thing up to a billion.
[00:08:32] Well, let me ask you a different question.
[00:08:34] What gave you the confidence to think that that was possible within 10 years?
[00:08:37] Because it really shouldn't be possible, at least, you know, to the sort of
[00:08:42] logical mind, right?
[00:08:44] This shouldn't be possible, yet you did it.
[00:08:46] And you did it faster than you thought.
[00:08:48] So what gave you the confidence and the courage to do that when really all signs were pointing to,
[00:08:54] it's going to take longer than that.
[00:08:56] Yeah, or even be possible at all, right?
[00:08:58] I think for me, that goes back to just that background of, you know,
[00:09:05] I told people when I was five years old, I remember having a picture of me.
[00:09:10] My mom bought me like one of those little uniforms, and that was my Christmas gift.
[00:09:15] And I remember telling people like, five, I'm going to make it to the NFL.
[00:09:18] And so can you imagine from five to 22 for 17 years, you're telling people something that
[00:09:24] is merely impossible if you look at the numbers?
[00:09:26] Absolutely.
[00:09:27] I mean, it literally is no way different from a number standpoint.
[00:09:31] You should make it to the NFL.
[00:09:33] And so not only to make it, but to make it in the first two rounds.
[00:09:36] So I had already been there before, right?
[00:09:39] Holding onto a dream that coaches, opponents, family members, teammates,
[00:09:45] whoever tried to talk you out of like, hey, that's not possible.
[00:09:48] It's not real.
[00:09:49] You might want to do something different.
[00:09:51] And you just keep fighting for it, man.
[00:09:53] You keep holding onto it because you know within your heart is possible.
[00:09:56] So when I achieved that dream at 22, I tell people, I'm okay with playing the long game.
[00:10:03] It took me 17 years to achieve a dream, right?
[00:10:05] 
[00:10:06] And when I tell people one day, like I said, hey, I'm going to go D1 in college football.
[00:10:10] Well, at that time, this is a crazy DJ.
[00:10:13] My sophomore year, I was the only sophomore in varsity.
[00:10:16] We went O and T. We didn't win one game.
[00:10:18] My junior year, we went one and nine.
[00:10:20] So going into my senior year, we were one in 19.
[00:10:24] Yeah.
[00:10:24] We hadn't signed a D1 recruiting 10 years and I'm telling people I'm going to go D1.
[00:10:29] And I ended up leaving my high school with 20 D1 offers.
[00:10:33] And then I actually had about seven bull-riding academic offers to like Rice University,
[00:10:39] UNC places like that.
[00:10:41] So I've been there before.
[00:10:43] So in my mind, when I feel it and pray about it, I'm like, that's what I'm doing.
[00:10:48] I don't even think about the other option of not doing it.
[00:10:51] And I would say put me in a desert, I'll find my way to the water.
[00:10:54] That's just the way I'm wired.
[00:10:55] And I think that's what people are seeing now as I'm growing one of the fastest organizations.
[00:11:00] And the history now, VXP, is because I'm giving people the roadmap to get there and get there
[00:11:06] with the right tools.
[00:11:08] Yeah, boy, that is, you just said so much in such a short period of time there because
[00:11:14] really you talked about perseverance.
[00:11:15] You talked about singularly focused, like almost like horse was when they put the blinders on.
[00:11:21] It's like, hey, I'm going to achieve this.
[00:11:24] And there's certain things that are outside of that were really outside of your control,
[00:11:28] right? You talked about the record in high school, like not great, not your record,
[00:11:34] but just the overall team record.
[00:11:35] There's no history of D1 players in any recent history from that school.
[00:11:41] Yet you did it.
[00:11:43] And I'm guessing because you were singularly focused, I imagine.
[00:11:47] And if you hadn't of been drafted second round, I imagine that really wouldn't have
[00:11:53] changed much for you anyway because you would have just pivoted and pointed your north star
[00:11:58] at something else and made that successful.
[00:12:01] I imagine is perseverance.
[00:12:04] How important is that to you?
[00:12:05] I mean, I imagine it's got to be pretty important.
[00:12:08] Perseverance is very important, but what I will tell you is the great thing about athletics,
[00:12:15] the great thing on growing up with a single mom, the great thing with my background is day
[00:12:20] and in day out, you have to get up and you have to work.
[00:12:26] I had successful businesses as an entrepreneur in middle school.
[00:12:30] Like when I was 12 years old, I had like different businesses that I was running.
[00:12:34] And so just the mentality of I don't wake up with the,
[00:12:39] oh, it's not possible.
[00:12:40] I'll wake up with, okay, how am I getting there like right now?
[00:12:43] What steps do I have to take day in and day out?
[00:12:46] Like there's a great book of Tom McHabbits, right?
[00:12:48] It's just love a Tom McHabbits.
[00:12:49] Oh man.
[00:12:50] And so I think the reason why, you know, I've been coaching Real Estate Agents now for 10 years.
[00:12:55] And two things I always said no to is people would ask me to come train their agents.
[00:12:59] And I would say I can't do it.
[00:13:00] I don't have a coaching business or can I invest in your Real Estate projects.
[00:13:04] I didn't raise money and I didn't have time to teach.
[00:13:07] So I would just teach my agents.
[00:13:08] But as I've now started expanding my coaching services,
[00:13:11] people have blown away.
[00:13:12] But the athlete and me and the coaching me,
[00:13:15] I can give you very practical tools
[00:13:19] that it doesn't sound like, man, I got to do all of that to get there.
[00:13:22] It's like, no, just do this for the next 30 days.
[00:13:25] And once we get to 5 million in volume over the next year,
[00:13:28] and here's how you get to 10 million.
[00:13:30] And here's how you get to 18.
[00:13:31] One of the things I took pride in is I'm real big on studying statistics.
[00:13:36] And once I see statistics and then I say, okay, the average agent closes seven to 10
[00:13:41] deals a year per year.
[00:13:42] How do I five extra with my team and my brokerage?
[00:13:45] And so for the 10 years that I ran an independent brokerage,
[00:13:49] we average 39.5 transactions per person.
[00:13:52] So our per person production was at 40 deals per person.
[00:13:55] It's amazing.
[00:13:56] And so we were so focused on just everybody being very successful versus
[00:14:00] just growing the numbers.
[00:14:03] Wow.
[00:14:04] I mean, it's, it's, it is truly incredible.
[00:14:07] And you're right.
[00:14:07] This idea of seeing what is possible, because there are people that do this, right?
[00:14:14] Like you're not the first guy to 5x, you know, a team's production.
[00:14:18] Although you're probably one of the first people to do it,
[00:14:20] but you're probably not the first.
[00:14:22] There's other people that have done this.
[00:14:23] You can study some of their habits.
[00:14:25] Oftentimes you could just reach out to these people and ask.
[00:14:28] That's what I do on the show.
[00:14:29] I'm reaching out to you right now to share, you know, your secrets with, with our audience.
[00:14:33] So it is incredible.
[00:14:35] How important was it, you know, you've been, you've had coaches,
[00:14:38] you know, throughout your entire academic life, you know,
[00:14:42] starting from as early as, as when you really got into athletics as a young man.
[00:14:46] And then all the way through, you know, high school, college, professional, professional,
[00:14:50] athletic athletics.
[00:14:51] And then how important is it to be coachable?
[00:14:55] Because of course, you, you, you have the perseverance.
[00:14:57] You've got the discipline.
[00:14:59] But having a coach, how important is that?
[00:15:02] I think the biggest misnomer about coaches
[00:15:06] that really shocked me because when we,
[00:15:09] from 15 years old, on, I kind of got removed from the world.
[00:15:13] Right? Like when we were on campus at Tixet,
[00:15:16] and like we, they like had us like overheated, like a wave.
[00:15:19] 
[00:15:19] Right.
[00:15:20] Your day is planned out.
[00:15:21] And when you get to NFL, like you see us playing,
[00:15:23] but no one really gets to personally interact with you.
[00:15:25] So when I got introduced back into the world at 22 years,
[00:15:29] all the 23 ones are retired.
[00:15:31] I was just blown away at the unwillingness to be passionate about what people do every day.
[00:15:36] It was like, where am I at right now?
[00:15:39] Life, because we had the best doctors, the best marketing people, the best
[00:15:43] publicists, the best everything, the best nutritionists.
[00:15:46] So I just miss being around greatness.
[00:15:48] And that's what I wanted to create.
[00:15:49] And I think the biggest misnomer with that
[00:15:52] is that all coaches or all mentors have the right playbook.
[00:15:57] Sure.
[00:15:58] Because there's a lot of broker owners.
[00:16:00] And that's what blew me away.
[00:16:01] They became broker owners because they were not good real estate agents.
[00:16:05] That's true.
[00:16:05] It's like, let me hide behind the desk and say,
[00:16:07] I don't want to sell real estate.
[00:16:09] I just want to be a broker.
[00:16:10] Well, you would not sell in a lot of real estate anyway.
[00:16:12] And so it blows me away.
[00:16:14] And it's like, hey, after the new year,
[00:16:16] we want to lose 10 pounds and we show up.
[00:16:18] And our trainer is out of shape.
[00:16:20] Well, then I got the wrong trainer.
[00:16:22] So I'm always telling people, man, when you look at getting a broker or a mentor,
[00:16:27] a team leader or a sponsor at eXp,
[00:16:29] really make sure they have the successful track record
[00:16:32] and that they can communicate it in bicepices pieces to you
[00:16:36] to follow the breadcrumbs to success.
[00:16:39] And that's one of the things that I take a lot of pride in building out the processes
[00:16:42] and the procedures to help people have the same or more success than I have at.
[00:16:47] Yeah, I think that's right.
[00:16:49] And you're a coach.
[00:16:49] Do you also still continue to get coached?
[00:16:52] I'm sure people would love to hear that if you do or not.
[00:16:56] I don't.
[00:16:57] But here's where I find my coaching and my wisdom.
[00:17:03] In my bottle, and then I'm a book, I'm a book guy.
[00:17:07] I love tangible books.
[00:17:10] And then I just got into podcasts.
[00:17:12] So that's really where my books is like my life line.
[00:17:15] Like I read my books.
[00:17:16] I'm doing a 52 week challenge right now
[00:17:18] with my organization at eXp.
[00:17:20] So we're reading one book a week every week.
[00:17:23] Wow.
[00:17:24] And then we meet in the room five days a week because I do everything by five.
[00:17:28] We meet in the room five days a week in clubhouse and we go over that book.
[00:17:32] So there's a lot of accountability there.
[00:17:34] And it's been really good, man.
[00:17:36] So their digest is so much information at a rapid pace.
[00:17:39] And that's been life changing for us.
[00:17:42] Do you have as so far as there been one book?
[00:17:45] And I know you're reading so many that I'm sure they're all valuable.
[00:17:47] In certain ways.
[00:17:49] As there have been one, you know, you mentioned atomic habits before.
[00:17:52] Has there been one in the last, you know, however long you've been doing the 52 week challenge
[00:17:56] where you read a book once a week that's really sort of risen to the top of like that one spoke
[00:18:00] to me more than more than the others so far?
[00:18:03] I'll give you one, but then I got to give you five.
[00:18:06] Is that cool?
[00:18:07] Right ahead.
[00:18:09] So the one I would tell every human being that they need to read is untethered soul.
[00:18:14] Oh, yes.
[00:18:15] Untethered soul.
[00:18:16] 
[00:18:17] Oh my gosh.
[00:18:17] And then he's got a new version of it.
[00:18:19] I think living my untethered life.
[00:18:21] But untethered soul really gave me for your, you know, because as athletes as real estate entrepreneurs
[00:18:27] as these successful people, right, these brokers, these team leaders, these owners,
[00:18:32] we have to walk around with our chests out at all times.
[00:18:35] We got to be peacocks at all times.
[00:18:37] But some of us are broken, right?
[00:18:38] And some of us really need to be able to be in a safe place to communicate what we're going through
[00:18:43] mentally.
[00:18:44] But you don't, you got to put this mask on every day, right?
[00:18:47] And untethered soul really breaks that down.
[00:18:49] And that book is life changing to where you realize like you need to be breathing,
[00:18:54] doing breathing exercises every day.
[00:18:56] You know, we talk about hydration and sleep and all that.
[00:18:59] But when someone's talking about breathing, how important it is.
[00:19:01] No one's talking about the mental aspect of life to be able to meditate and step away from
[00:19:07] this nauseous world of information and slow the brain.
[00:19:12] It reminds me of that expression.
[00:19:14] It's an old musical expression, which is it's not the notes that make the melody.
[00:19:19] It's not the notes that actually create the song.
[00:19:22] It's the space in between the notes.
[00:19:24] And it's like, oh, yeah, of course, it's the space in between notes.
[00:19:26] Otherwise, it's just one continual note.
[00:19:28] And that's the silence that we don't often give ourselves.
[00:19:33] I find, you know, we have a device in our pocket.
[00:19:36] I was thinking about this this weekend.
[00:19:38] I'm not the first person to think about this.
[00:19:39] I'm not, it's not a brilliant thought.
[00:19:41] But it's almost like a magic.
[00:19:42] It's almost like magic.
[00:19:43] We have magic in our pocket 24, 7.
[00:19:46] And we can use that to summon up whatever we desire.
[00:19:49] And you have to be really careful because it's super addictive.
[00:19:52] And it takes time away from being able to sit alone quietly and think and reflect.
[00:19:57] Do you make meditation or reflection a regular practice for you?
[00:20:02] I have.
[00:20:03] We were taught to visualize as athletes, but we never taught to meditate and breathe.
[00:20:08] And I think it talked about, you know, in the US, we are the worst at breathing, right?
[00:20:15] Our posh is terrible.
[00:20:16] Look at me right now.
[00:20:17] I need to sit up now.
[00:20:18] I'm thinking about it, right?
[00:20:19] And we just don't breathe.
[00:20:21] We don't breathe well.
[00:20:22] We're continually throughout the day taking short breaths.
[00:20:25] And we're not taking deep, long, continual breaths.
[00:20:28] We're rushing to the next meeting.
[00:20:30] And I always tell everybody, that's why I started this whole movement.
[00:20:33] We have to become real estate entrepreneurs.
[00:20:37] We can't just be REALTORS.
[00:20:38] We can't just be brokers.
[00:20:39] We can't just be team leaders.
[00:20:40] We have to be real estate entrepreneurs.
[00:20:43] And when we become real estate entrepreneurs, we're creating multiple income streams.
[00:20:47] We're thinking about legacy, right?
[00:20:49] We're not just, we're not just building a business for today.
[00:20:51] We're building a business that will give back to our kids kids, right?
[00:20:55] We're thinking about other people.
[00:20:56] And we're thinking about our mental health.
[00:20:57] We're thinking about the impact we want to leave.
[00:21:00] That's the real estate entrepreneur piece that I really like win all in on, man.
[00:21:04] Like we even had a day called Rejuvenate Day.
[00:21:07] We brought in all my agents.
[00:21:10] And we brought in a nutritionist.
[00:21:12] We brought in a trainer.
[00:21:13] We brought in a psychologist.
[00:21:15] Like we brought in any of grand coaches.
[00:21:18] We brought in massage therapists, a yoga instructor.
[00:21:21] We started off with yoga.
[00:21:22] And it was a beautiful day.
[00:21:24] Just like really just putting them outside the box in this place of
[00:21:28] uncomfortableness to force them to think about these things.
[00:21:30] And man, I have so many of my agents that still takes me.
[00:21:33] Man, I'm still using some of the things I learned that Rejuvenate Day.
[00:21:36] So that's really what I'm focused on.
[00:21:38] I love that.
[00:21:39] It's a holistic approach to being successful at business.
[00:21:43] Because you're really talking about being successful in every area of life.
[00:21:47] Because if we think of our life as a circle or a wheel,
[00:21:52] we got to make sure that we're pretty smooth around the edges.
[00:21:56] We got to make sure that our family life isn't in the toilet.
[00:21:59] If we're expected to do, you know, but our business life is going great.
[00:22:03] It's like it all has to be working pretty pretty well.
[00:22:06] Not that we don't have ups and downs.
[00:22:08] Because of course every single person does,
[00:22:10] regardless of their level of success.
[00:22:11] We all go through things.
[00:22:13] But this idea of treating not just the business side of it,
[00:22:16] treating the human side.
[00:22:18] And you know, the breathing thing is so interesting.
[00:22:20] Because we all know this.
[00:22:22] Like we've all heard this a million times.
[00:22:23] We need to slow down our breasts.
[00:22:24] We need to take deep diaphragmic breaths.
[00:22:26] We need to, you know, and yet,
[00:22:28] I never really realized the benefit
[00:22:31] until I read some studies on breathing where,
[00:22:35] you know, I am, I have a lot of anxiety.
[00:22:38] It's just kind of, you know, part of my DNA or whatever,
[00:22:40] how I was raised or whatever.
[00:22:41] But regardless, there are breathing exercises
[00:22:44] that have been proven to reduce anxiety.
[00:22:47] And I'm like, oh, this is so great.
[00:22:49] I don't have to think my way out of it.
[00:22:50] I could do these deep breathing exercises that are super simple.
[00:22:54] And it's like, wait a two minutes.
[00:22:55] And then, oh, my God, I feel better.
[00:22:57] So it is, it is remarkable.
[00:23:00] But you're right.
[00:23:01] Taking short breaths throughout the day.
[00:23:02] Nobody talks about this in real estate at least.
[00:23:05] It is really a big, big deal.
[00:23:07] And athletes are taught how to take deeper,
[00:23:10] longer breaths because of course,
[00:23:11] you're also in peak physical condition,
[00:23:14] which helps.
[00:23:15] But beyond just working out,
[00:23:17] you can do this at your desk.
[00:23:18] You can do this throughout the day.
[00:23:20] And it really does center.
[00:23:22] I mean, it's the basis of meditation, right, as breath.
[00:23:24] So boy, you're saying you're saying a lot of really,
[00:23:28] really great things that I've had done a lot of these episodes
[00:23:30] that people don't talk about.
[00:23:31] I mean, certainly we talk about being physically fit
[00:23:34] and drinking enough water and eating right.
[00:23:36] But this idea of breathing and meditating and reflecting,
[00:23:40] I think we're such a stimulus response world.
[00:23:45] And again, the phone in our pockets,
[00:23:46] going to try to grab our attention every few seconds.
[00:23:48] This is a way to shut that out.
[00:23:51] So, yeah, let's, oh, before we get,
[00:23:53] let's talk about your podcast.
[00:23:54] I know this is new.
[00:23:55] This is real estate entrepreneur with Terence Murphy.
[00:23:58] So tell us about it.
[00:24:00] Yeah, before we go there, I want to make sure
[00:24:01] that I'm following up for your audience
[00:24:03] because I tell them I give them five books and I'm real big.
[00:24:05] Oh, I'm sorry. Yes.
[00:24:06] More books.
[00:24:06] Yeah.
[00:24:07] So untethered.
[00:24:08] So,
[00:24:09] why the rich get richer by Robert Kielzaki.
[00:24:11] It's great book.
[00:24:13] Atomic Abyss, which we talked about earlier,
[00:24:16] traction by Gino Wakeman.
[00:24:18] So you got those four.
[00:24:19] And then good to great.
[00:24:20] Those would be the five I would have people read.
[00:24:24] And as we pivot to the podcast, I think more than anything,
[00:24:30] people realize that they need more, especially real estate agents.
[00:24:36] And you've been through a downturn.
[00:24:38] I would say a recessive market or a shifting market.
[00:24:42] I think people will start realizing that again, that they need more.
[00:24:47] And one of the things that I teach my agency,
[00:24:49] Sweat Equity versus Check Equity,
[00:24:51] truly building a business with the right foundation
[00:24:55] versus just buying leads, right?
[00:24:57] And we saw open doors, Zillow Redfin.
[00:25:00] And so the people were just buying those leads.
[00:25:02] They are in these contracts.
[00:25:03] Real estate agents are stuck in these contracts.
[00:25:05] They're paying $2,500 a month, $3,000 a month.
[00:25:08] And I'm not getting the same.
[00:25:09] And even beyond that, what happens if and when Zillow is like,
[00:25:12] you know, we're just going to be our own thing.
[00:25:14] We're going to have our own agents.
[00:25:15] We're going to do our own thing.
[00:25:16] We're good.
[00:25:16] We're no longer selling leads to agents.
[00:25:19] That day, and this is just a gasp, that day's coming.
[00:25:24] So I'm sorry, go right ahead.
[00:25:26] I interrupted you.
[00:25:27] No, no, you have the same passion for it as I do.
[00:25:29] They take our information from us and then sell it back to us.
[00:25:34] So I'm always trying to empower real estate agents.
[00:25:36] I have a very, very
[00:25:38] soft heart in a sense that I've seen so many of my friends.
[00:25:43] I worked with agents at Colourwoods when I started.
[00:25:46] I was 23 and they were in their late 70s and 80s still selling real estate.
[00:25:49] And that's why I would say when have you been to a real estate agent's retirement party?
[00:25:54] Either get out of the industry or they sell real estate until they don't know what else to do.
[00:25:59] And that's what I'm creating.
[00:26:01] I'm creating the real estate entrepreneur movement
[00:26:04] where like, I'll think about it on a normal real estate transaction.
[00:26:07] There's about 20 to 22 companies that make money.
[00:26:10] Title, mortgage, survey, home warranty.
[00:26:13] I can keep going, right?
[00:26:15] Inspection appraisal, yeah, etc.
[00:26:16] It keeps going.
[00:26:18] So I'm teaching my people in my work how to buy those businesses
[00:26:21] and get owner distributions.
[00:26:23] I'm teaching them how to invest in real estate,
[00:26:25] how to start their first investment portfolio.
[00:26:27] Because my wife and I have bought commercial strip centers.
[00:26:30] We bought multifamily.
[00:26:32] We've done neighborhoods.
[00:26:33] We're developing neighborhoods alongside Jack Nicholas right now.
[00:26:37] And so we've done it and we're teaching people those exact steps on how to create
[00:26:41] multiple income streams.
[00:26:43] I want to pause for a moment to talk about our episode sponsor.
[00:26:47] Our one of my favorite companies out there follow up boss.
[00:26:50] Now after interviewing hundreds of top REALTORS in the country for this podcast,

[00:27:59] Follow up like a boss with follow up boss.
[00:28:02] And now back to our episode.
[00:28:04] Yeah, it really is the way to go as as somebody who I'm not a broker owner myself.
[00:28:09] Although I work hand in hand with with our owner here.
[00:28:12] And he and I have created several ancillary companies to do exactly what you're talking about.
[00:28:17] You know, because for people who might not be realizing,
[00:28:20] especially people who want to start their own firm,
[00:28:22] what you might not realize, at least on the residential side,
[00:28:25] is brokerage is a very low margin business on its own.
[00:28:29] And to really make a nice business that might be sellable one day,
[00:28:35] you need to have these ancillary lines.
[00:28:37] And also there are just great ways to increase the bottom line in getting involved in title,
[00:28:41] maybe lending, depending on what state you might be in.
[00:28:44] You know, like in commission advance, there's a lot of title.
[00:28:47] It sure, you know, like you were saying, lots of different lines.
[00:28:50] You're absolutely so right.
[00:28:52] Because I think people oftentimes want to want to get in,
[00:28:55] be their own managing broker, have their own business.
[00:28:57] And they don't realize what the margins actually look like.
[00:29:01] And then they're like, oh, wow, this is not the this is not like I just broke free from a
[00:29:05] Keller Williams, which is a great company.
[00:29:07] But now I'm on my own.
[00:29:08] I get to keep everything.
[00:29:09] And it's like, oh, and now I have all these other expenses as well.
[00:29:12] So it becomes tricky.
[00:29:14] And but I think you're right.
[00:29:15] This idea of an entrepreneur is Robert Kiyosaki is sort of the guy who really made this
[00:29:21] as popular as it is.
[00:29:22] This is this idea of residual income and creating streams of income that are more predictable.
[00:29:27] Because as we know, real estate is transactional.
[00:29:29] It's so odd to me that no one has figured out how to make it a fee-based business,
[00:29:34] like what financial advisors have done.
[00:29:37] Financial advisors is the smartest thing ever, which basically said, we're not stock brokers anymore.
[00:29:41] We're not earning commissions.
[00:29:42] We're going to pay us 1% or whatever the percent of all the assets under management.
[00:29:48] Real estate hasn't figured out how to do that.
[00:29:50] Maybe they never will.
[00:29:51] So real estate does become very transactional.
[00:29:53] You need these other businesses just so that you can not freak out on the first of the month every month.
[00:29:59] Yeah, and hit a wall.
[00:30:02] It's like this, I'm going to draw, I'm going to create an image one day.
[00:30:06] I may even create a t-shirt.
[00:30:08] But it's got these past.
[00:30:10] And they all have a hamster will at the end.
[00:30:13] But they make you think that this path is better than that path.
[00:30:16] So it's like you're a real estate agent, you're a brand new agent.
[00:30:19] Now you become a top producer.
[00:30:20] Now you lead a team.
[00:30:22] Now you own the brokerage.
[00:30:24] Yeah.
[00:30:24] You've made it.
[00:30:25] When in reality, most of the brokers I talk to are the ones that are broke.
[00:30:28] It's called broker for a reason.
[00:30:30] And the margins are based.
[00:30:32] I ran a mastermind of the top broker owners in the world at one point or in the US.
[00:30:38] And I ran it in the shadows.
[00:30:40] And no one even knew I started this group.
[00:30:42] But I told them the one rule I have is, well, too, if you're not going to be here, let me know.
[00:30:46] And two is we can't talk about this in any public forum.
[00:30:49] So I was running a mastermind for some of the top brokers in the United States for like three years.
[00:30:55] No one ever knew about.
[00:30:56] This is just a we and man, we, I mean, you had Kelo Williams, you had RE/MAX, you had
[00:31:01] Kyle Wilbanker, Sotheby's, independent brokers in that room.
[00:31:04] And I coached him every week.
[00:31:07] And everybody was saying the same stuff no matter what model they were in.
[00:31:10] They were in.
[00:31:11] So and I think that's why EXPs, the fastest growing broker in the world.
[00:31:15] Because it's figured out how to give agents shares and stock.
[00:31:19] It's figured out how to give them new income streams.
[00:31:22] And it's it's it's a beautiful model.
[00:31:24] But I know we were going to talk about the podcast.
[00:31:25] I wanted to go back and hit those books.
[00:31:27] Oh, yeah.
[00:31:28] And no, and thank you for that.
[00:31:29] And before we get to the podcast, I think, you know, what what eXp did is is really,
[00:31:33] it's beyond remarkable because they the way I interpreted it is they basically took the
[00:31:38] Keller Williams model and said it wasn't quite exactly fully realized in the way that
[00:31:42] Keller Williams.
[00:31:43] And I'm not picking on Keller Williams.
[00:31:44] Obviously, they're an amazing company, of course.
[00:31:46] But basically people left Keller Williams and said, we think there's a better way to do the
[00:31:51] same sort of thing with, you know, giving people more agency, more ownership.
[00:31:56] And so they figured it out and holy crap did they figure it out.
[00:31:59] They are.
[00:32:00] I mean, it's it's like the results speak for themselves.
[00:32:03] And anyway, so yeah, let's talk about the podcast.
[00:32:06] Yeah, last thing on that, I always tell people when they ask me what's the difference.
[00:32:10] And I know Gary personally, we actually met years ago.
[00:32:14] We got introduced by Tim Howe.
[00:32:16] He's a friend of mine from college.
[00:32:17] One of their top agents.
[00:32:18] Great for him.
[00:32:19] Great guy.
[00:32:20] And we were supposed to meet for five minutes and three and a half hours later.
[00:32:24] Me and Gary and Josh team, my wife was in the room.
[00:32:27] It was just us four.
[00:32:28] She checked out.
[00:32:29] She's like, y'all go with it.
[00:32:31] And as you can see how my mind works, I mean, we were just me and Gary were just on the white
[00:32:35] boards going at it for three hours.
[00:32:37] Man, he's an amazing dude.
[00:32:39] Sharp guy.
[00:32:40] James respect for him.
[00:32:41] Man, he's a genius.
[00:32:42] And so I always respect him.
[00:32:43] And he said, dude, I have 100 and at the time, 80,000 agents, he's like,
[00:32:47] you're different, you're special.
[00:32:48] I want to be a part of your story.
[00:32:49] Anything I can do to help you and Eric let me know.
[00:32:51] So always respect Gary on that.
[00:32:53] I will say on the model, I will say you explain it this way.
[00:32:58] Profit share, if you take a P&L statement, where's profit?
[00:33:01] It's on the bottle.
[00:33:02] Yeah.
[00:33:02] Right.
[00:33:02] And so this person got to be paid.
[00:33:04] This person got to be paid.
[00:33:04] This person got to be paid.
[00:33:06] And finally, we'll share the profit with the agents.
[00:33:08] Where usually there's not a lot left.
[00:33:10] Right.
[00:33:10] Where eXp flipped it upside down and say, what's on the top of a...
[00:33:14] We'll pay at the top, yeah.
[00:33:15] Yeah, it's revenue.
[00:33:16] Yeah, so that's a difference.
[00:33:18] But yeah, it's...
[00:33:18] Yeah, and they figured out how to do it.
[00:33:20] No one else had figured out how to do that.
[00:33:22] Now there's a bit of a few copycats that are coming along.
[00:33:24] Because they're like, hey, this idea of this rev share model
[00:33:28] works really, really well.
[00:33:29] So it is truly incredible.
[00:33:32] Yeah, so let's talk about real estate entrepreneur.
[00:33:34] What's the goal of the podcast?
[00:33:36] Who are you speaking to?
[00:33:38] And by the way, everyone should check it out.
[00:33:39] We're going to have a link to this directly in the show notes
[00:33:41] as well so you can subscribe right from the show notes.
[00:33:44] But tell us about it.
[00:33:45] Yeah, so when I was thinking about a podcast,
[00:33:48] my wife has really been on to me about celebrating.
[00:33:52] Just the overachiever me, chief stuff.
[00:33:55] I don't even stop to smell the roses.
[00:33:56] I'm already...
[00:33:57] 
[00:33:57] It's like the next month, right?
[00:33:59] I'm just a hunch.
[00:34:00] And one day she said, you got to celebrate.
[00:34:02] I said, okay, cool.
[00:34:02] So we achieved a goal in our 20s that we wanted to achieve,
[00:34:05] which was buying a strip center.
[00:34:07] We bought a strip center in North Carolina in Nashville.
[00:34:10] It's Buffalo, Wyoming, Starbucks, and different tenants.
[00:34:14] So we took a picture in front of it and I posted it.
[00:34:17] And like a week later, it had like a million shares.
[00:34:19] And I was like, what just happened?
[00:34:20] You know, like, well, how?
[00:34:22] And people were just so inspired by the story
[00:34:24] that we told the piece that I posted.
[00:34:27] And that's when I realized like,
[00:34:28] what I'm doing and how I'm doing it
[00:34:31] can help a lot of people.
[00:34:34] So people started messaging me,
[00:34:35] messaging me on Instagram, Facebook.
[00:34:37] And I could not obviously keep up with all the messages.
[00:34:39] Do you have an e-book?
[00:34:40] Do you have a book?
[00:34:41] Do you have a coaching course?
[00:34:42] Do you have a podcast?
[00:34:43] And you know, the crazy thing is at the time,
[00:34:45] I realized, I told them, my wife and said,
[00:34:47] we don't have any of these.
[00:34:48] We have no way to help these people.
[00:34:51] So that's when I said, all right, let's start this podcast.
[00:34:53] And so instead of naming it real estate, REALTOR,
[00:34:56] or builder, or broker,
[00:34:58] real estate entrepreneur kind of embodied everything that I'm doing.
[00:35:02] But the goal is to go after REALTORS,
[00:35:05] to go after brokers, to go after builders,
[00:35:07] go after investors and just let them know.
[00:35:10] These are the fundamental things you need to be learning,
[00:35:12] reading about and putting in place in order to scale your business.
[00:35:15] Because the one thing I'm passionate about is scalability.
[00:35:18] I know how to scale things and I know how to grow things.
[00:35:21] And that's something I'm passionate about doing.
[00:35:23] So that's what the podcast is,
[00:35:25] real estate entrepreneur, Ruth Tarris Murphy.
[00:35:27] And I'm just bringing in people to talk about that.
[00:35:30] Yeah, scalability is really its own skill set.
[00:35:34] It requires the willingness to probably step away
[00:35:39] from individual production or to step outside of the constraints
[00:35:43] of individual production.
[00:35:45] And which, you know, for anyone who's a real estate agent
[00:35:49] is probably hyper focused on their own personal production or their team's production.
[00:35:53] And then trying to say, okay, how do I, how do I want X2X510Xs?
[00:35:59] And which require a whole set of systems.
[00:36:02] So your systems, your data and systems guy really at heart.
[00:36:05] Processing people is what we say in our organizations.
[00:36:08] Because people are asking, how do you own 20 companies
[00:36:10] and you're invested in another 30 process in people?
[00:36:14] And the crazy thing.
[00:36:16] So go ahead.
[00:36:16] Go for it, DJ.
[00:36:17] So I have a question that I'm sure every single person on this podcast is thinking,
[00:36:22] how does this guy accomplish and do so much?
[00:36:26] This isn't me giving you a compliment, although it is a great compliment.
[00:36:29] But it's really how are you able to be a podcaster
[00:36:34] and entrepreneur, run a brokerage?
[00:36:37] All, you know, you own lots of properties.
[00:36:40] You have a team.
[00:36:42] How is there enough time in the day?
[00:36:44] So this probably goes back to scalability.
[00:36:46] But how are you able to sort of keep it all running when most of us
[00:36:49] you know, are focused in one or two things and we're struggling?
[00:36:52] How are you able to maintain that focus with all the different, you know,
[00:36:57] sort of adventures that you're into?
[00:36:59] And oh, and you're a VC.
[00:37:00] So we can keep going.
[00:37:02] You do a lot.
[00:37:03] How you can do it all?
[00:37:05] You know, I believe everything we go through in life is to be a part of your story.
[00:37:12] And when I was 16, my mom had a heart attack.
[00:37:15] And so at that moment in time, she made it through for a couple more years after.
[00:37:20] But I was working two jobs in high school.
[00:37:23] I was the team captain on the football team.
[00:37:25] I was in honor of society with a 3.8 GPA.
[00:37:28] So I'd already been learning these tools.
[00:37:30] And when you at 16, I drove myself to school.
[00:37:33] I fed myself like I literally was at home by myself.
[00:37:37] And so you just I kind of became an adult at an early age.
[00:37:39] And I didn't understand why I was going through that.
[00:37:42] Like why was it so hard?
[00:37:43] But looking back, like those experiences happen for a reason.
[00:37:47] Same thing with my NFL career, I worked my butt off to get there.
[00:37:50] And I got paralyzed.
[00:37:51] Man, I got paralyzed from the neck down.
[00:37:53] I had a really bad neck injury.
[00:37:54] And just working my way back from something of that trauma, right?
[00:38:00] And just learning how to use your arms again to walk again.
[00:38:02] You know, I had neck surgery.
[00:38:04] And I'm like, why am I going through this?
[00:38:07] But it's not why it's how can you use it to inspire other people?
[00:38:12] And how can you use it to be a better version of yourself?
[00:38:16] That's what I'll tell everybody in my word.
[00:38:18] You are competing with you.
[00:38:20] I want you to be the best version of DJ.
[00:38:22] Everybody else is already taking.
[00:38:24] So be the best version of you.
[00:38:26] And in that, my capacity group,
[00:38:28] my passion for entrepreneurship and real estate group,
[00:38:33] my one prayer to God when I was in the middle of depression,
[00:38:36] I mean, deep in depression,
[00:38:37] at 22 years old, my dream was shaking away from me.
[00:38:40] I can't walk.
[00:38:41] I'm in a wheelchair.
[00:38:41] I'm trying to figure this stuff out.
[00:38:43] It's just give me a passion God.
[00:38:45] Give me something that I could be passionate about.
[00:38:48] And when he gave me real estate, that's when I knew.
[00:38:50] Okay.
[00:38:51] So that's why when people, when they hear me speak,
[00:38:54] or they listen to me, they're like,
[00:38:55] do you just speak with this different conviction?
[00:38:58] Because when you're praying to God in the middle of depression
[00:39:00] and you paralyzed, they God give me a passion.
[00:39:02] And he shows it to you.
[00:39:04] There's no way I can't speak with conviction.
[00:39:06] So as I think through how we are trying to scale,
[00:39:12] I'm always challenging myself.
[00:39:14] The foundation of scalability is number one, you.
[00:39:18] Are you operating with the best version of your time?
[00:39:21] I call it TBS.
[00:39:23] Where's my time best spent on a day-to-day basis?
[00:39:25] So I literally meet with my team probably every other week
[00:39:29] about my schedule, which people would think,
[00:39:31] well, you kind of created and leave it, right?
[00:39:33] Interesting.
[00:39:34] I meet and I refine my schedule every two to three weeks.
[00:39:38] And no one will tell you that because no one's doing that, right?
[00:39:41] But when people ask me, well, how did you learn that?
[00:39:44] Well, I learned it from, okay, if I'm a wire receiver,
[00:39:47] and at practice, I'm running this route, right?
[00:39:49] And I dropped the ball.
[00:39:51] Well, right after practice, I go right in and I put the tape on.
[00:39:53] I'm like, okay, if I were to just put my foot here and went this way,
[00:39:56] it would have made it easier.
[00:39:58] So I took that.
[00:39:59] All I did is take life experiences and I translated it into real estate entrepreneurship.
[00:40:05] So that's why when people are trying to study me,
[00:40:07] they can't figure me out.
[00:40:08] I'm an enigma because I'm pulling from life experiences.
[00:40:12] I'm pulling from books.
[00:40:13] I'm pulling from things that no one,
[00:40:15] I've taken the ingredients of my life and made it into a recipe.
[00:40:20] And now I'm able to listen to you.
[00:40:22] I can interview DJ.
[00:40:24] And the first thing if you were going to work and be a part of my team,
[00:40:27] I would want to know your story.
[00:40:28] I want to know those points.
[00:40:30] And I can help you take those ingredients of your life and create it into a successful
[00:40:34] recipe to skill.
[00:40:36] So that was a long answer to say,
[00:40:38] everybody's recipe will be different,
[00:40:41] but it starts with time blocking.
[00:40:43] And then once we understand where we're putting our time,
[00:40:46] how we're managing our time,
[00:40:48] then it's processing people.
[00:40:50] And I said,
[00:40:52] you know, it's so funny because we do want to make this more complicated.
[00:40:57] We want as individuals to think,
[00:40:59] oh my gosh, my life is so complicated.
[00:41:01] And yes, it can feel that way.
[00:41:03] And absolutely, I'm not here to say that,
[00:41:05] you know, my life is harder than anyone else is more complicated
[00:41:09] because of course, everybody's their own unique individual,
[00:41:11] as their own challenges.
[00:41:12] But you're absolutely right about this idea that what we have to do is constantly evaluate.
[00:41:19] And not in a, oh, I'm worthless way, not in a denigrating way,
[00:41:24] but in a, hmm, where is my time best spent today?
[00:41:28] Where was my time best spent yesterday?
[00:41:30] Where did I, you know, where was I not super effective?
[00:41:32] What's another skill I can learn?
[00:41:34] Just trying to keep the tools, actually not even sharpen,
[00:41:38] but adding more tools and more sharp tools to the quiver.
[00:41:42] You know, this idea of reading 52 books a year,
[00:41:44] if every REALTOR read five books a year,
[00:41:49] just five books a year.
[00:41:51] In fact, read the five that that Terrence recommended.
[00:41:53] But if they just did that, there would be massive change.
[00:41:57] Because all it takes is one or two good ideas.
[00:42:00] And the fact that you're doing 52 books a year
[00:42:03] is going to scale you up even faster with that knowledge.
[00:42:07] So it's, but it's also, but there's also a limit to how much time there is.
[00:42:11] So I'm curious on, so you talked about time best spent TBS.
[00:42:15] This idea of here's, here's where I can leverage the most growth
[00:42:19] within the shortest amount of time.
[00:42:24] And I also want to go all the way back to your story of,
[00:42:27] you know, you had to become an adult much earlier than a lot of us, right?
[00:42:33] Because of your situation growing up.
[00:42:35] That's not an easy thing for a child to have to do or teenager.
[00:42:40] You did it.
[00:42:41] You stayed focused.
[00:42:42] You achieved, you know, your professional goals up until, you know, up.
[00:42:46] And then your life was a lot of it.
[00:42:48] Your physical body was taken away from you, really.
[00:42:51] Just because that happens, things happen.
[00:42:53] And it's, it's awful.
[00:42:55] And yet, here you are.
[00:42:58] You're walking.
[00:42:58] You're in shape.
[00:43:00] You're now running these successful businesses.
[00:43:03] And, but you also said, depression is part of my story too.
[00:43:07] Like, yes, I am not a Superman.
[00:43:09] Like, even when, you know, your whole career gets taken away,
[00:43:12] that's going to put anyone in the massive depression.
[00:43:15] So I'm curious.
[00:43:16] And I wanted to ask about one thing about support group,
[00:43:19] having the support group.
[00:43:20] And I don't mean necessarily a building that you go into and sit in a circle
[00:43:24] with other people, although that is a version of that.
[00:43:26] It could be friends, family, could be colleagues.
[00:43:29] How important is it for you to have people in your life
[00:43:32] that you can share intimately and vulnerable, be vulnerable with?
[00:43:36] And say, hey, guys, I'm going through something right now.
[00:43:39] I am depressed.
[00:43:40] And yet, I'm still, you know, I'm still productive.
[00:43:42] I'm still getting my life together.
[00:43:44] But this is going on.
[00:43:45] And this is real.
[00:43:46] How important is it to have those relationships?
[00:43:49] And does that help you through the tougher times?
[00:43:51] Wow, it's good, bro.
[00:43:53] Man, this is a really good podcast.
[00:43:55] Yeah.
[00:43:56] If people aren't listening, they need to rewind this episode.
[00:43:59] I'm going to go back and listen to it multiple times.
[00:44:01] So I think it's really cool, man.
[00:44:05] And you know, the cool thing about it is,
[00:44:06] I tell people all the time, I don't have a broker anymore.
[00:44:10] I don't really have a team.
[00:44:11] I have a tribe.
[00:44:13] And I always say, you're a vibe or a track, you're a tribe.
[00:44:17] Yeah.
[00:44:18] Being you, the authentic you, not someone else.
[00:44:22] And like, that's going to attract the right people, the energy.
[00:44:28] And the realness, not fake positivity.
[00:44:31] Like, I don't want to be on the locker room
[00:44:33] who's not going to play a snap, walking around, hooping and hollering.
[00:44:37] Just day in and day out, we see Terrence get up in five in the morning and hit it.
[00:44:42] And we see him at the office and we see him in the waiting room.
[00:44:45] Or whatever, wherever you guys are at in your life.
[00:44:47] Just day in and day out, just getting up and doing the work.
[00:44:50] But when you hit a wall, because we all hit a wall,
[00:44:54] you can be vulnerable too.
[00:44:55] And that's what a true leader and a true,
[00:44:57] because to me, when you were able to be vulnerable with the right people.
[00:45:01] And so that's why I say, man, having the right tribe around you and protecting that energy.
[00:45:07] Like, we're at a place now we literally call it the zero tolerance rule.
[00:45:11] You can bring me any problem in the real estate team or organization,
[00:45:15] but it better have a solution attached.
[00:45:17] Because if not, then you're just complaining.
[00:45:20] And no one is allowed to bring any negative energy into our space.
[00:45:26] And if you do, we're going to call you out unless you have a solution attached.
[00:45:30] And just creating an atmosphere like that, an ecosystem like that, where there's a lot of
[00:45:36] successful people. But and I tell everybody, leave your pride at the door.
[00:45:41] No one can come into this space.
[00:45:44] And when somebody has feedback to help you, have ears to hear and not just ears to reply.
[00:45:50] Because in so many times, everybody just wants to reply.
[00:45:53] They're just ready to say something back versus slowing down and truly hearing what the
[00:45:57] person saying. And I think that's what we're so focused on right now.
[00:46:00] And in those situations of vulnerability and authenticity and real conversations,
[00:46:07] we can have a place where we can say, hey, you know what, DJ,
[00:46:11] thanks for pushing me a couple of weeks ago and really getting on my ass.
[00:46:14] I know I can do better. But now let's have this conversation.
[00:46:18] Man, I got a lot going on, man. This is what I got going on.
[00:46:21] Yeah. That's what yeah, the ability to be honest and to be vulnerable is,
[00:46:26] is really, I found very helpful when things get tough.
[00:46:31] Having people around who care and that that you care about, it really helps keep it.
[00:46:38] But you're right about this idea of problems and solutions. I want to just to go back to that
[00:46:42] for a second, because that is you just challenged me because I'm a, well, I'm like most people.
[00:46:47] I'm a complainer. And of course, and there's always things to complain about.
[00:46:53] Nothing's perfect. There's always, you know, I can complain about myself too, which is also not
[00:46:58] very helpful. But this idea of complaining is only helpful if you're like, and I think I can
[00:47:03] figure out a way around or I can ask somebody who's been there before me. You know, like I have a
[00:47:08] personal trainer you were talking about about being in the gym with a trainer. It's like, I have a
[00:47:13] trainer because I don't want to hurt myself in the gym. And also, I'm not a professional athlete
[00:47:18] and I don't know what I'm doing. So I've had a trainer for, I'll probably have a trainer the
[00:47:22] rest of my life, honestly. And it's not, it's because I need somebody who's like, do this, do this,
[00:47:28] do this. That's their expertise. I pay them for their expertise and I get the results.
[00:47:32] If I tried to do, I tried to do it all myself my whole life. I never got to the gym. Rarely,
[00:47:38] sometimes I'd go, sometimes I didn't. It wasn't, it wasn't just something I was able to do myself.
[00:47:44] So I had to, I had to find leverage. I had to say, okay, well, if I want to hire, if I need to hire
[00:47:49] a trainer, I need to make enough money to hire a trainer, which means I need to scale up my business.
[00:47:55] So I totally understand this idea of looking for solution. And it's not always easy. Solutions are
[00:48:02] not always, well, they're not always right in front of you. But if you have a good circle of people
[00:48:07] around, you know, sometimes other people can help you with your solutions too. And this idea of
[00:48:12] mastermining, we do this, I do the same thing with brokerages. We mastermind with other brokerages
[00:48:17] that are kind of similar to us all over the country. And like, hey, what are you guys doing right
[00:48:20] now? Like where are you, where are you guys struggling? What's working? Just doing that alone has helped.
[00:48:26] I get so many ideas. And I'm sort of shocked that so many real estate agents operate in a silo. They
[00:48:32] sort of operate in their own little world. They work from home, which I get. They're not really
[00:48:36] around other agents unless sort of showing or something. And they don't often know, like, there's
[00:48:41] lots of great ideas out there. And all you have to do is connect with other other REALTORS. What,
[00:48:46] how important is is having, having sort of people that you look up to, having idols, not idols
[00:48:55] in the religious sense, but just having people that you respect, having people that you, you know,
[00:48:59] obviously you're a reader. And, you know, you hung out with Gary Pellor for three and a half hours.
[00:49:04] Like, that's pretty cool. How important is it for you to get access to these people? And how much time
[00:49:09] has it saved you by reading something, learning something, having a conversation so that you didn't
[00:49:15] have to reinvent the wheel? Yeah, I think at this point, if you're a real estate agent, and you don't have
[00:49:23] someone who's achieved what you've achieved, because always say it's one thing to get inspiration,
[00:49:28] right? Like LeBron James did a dump there the night I was like, wow, that's awesome. I'm inspired
[00:49:32] by it. But how is that actually helping me, right? So the one thing I've tried to become, I don't
[00:49:37] want to just be an inspiration to anybody anymore. I want to be an inspiration that inspires you.
[00:49:42] But then I want to give you the breadcrumbs and the tools in the roadmap to go achieve the
[00:49:47] success that you want to achieve. So that other piece of puzzle is what I'm building out right now
[00:49:51] to truly give people the tools. So now they're inspired by them. So and then I'm inspired, but now I plug
[00:49:57] in boom. And then I think that's been the great thing now, because of running an independent broker,
[00:50:03] you kind of feel like you're on an island. So we're now like, you know, that was the thing. I
[00:50:07] remember going to a cabo my first eXp event and it says making real estate fun again. And I get
[00:50:13] there and every step I took, I knew a broker from being an independent broker. I just didn't know
[00:50:20] they were at eXp. So like every step I took, I'm like, whoa, you're here. You're here. It's like a
[00:50:25] class reunion. I'm like, oh, this is cool. And so yeah, it's just been one of those things where,
[00:50:30] you know, when you get to a place where everybody is successful, it's like flying with the Eagles.
[00:50:36] No one's really like hoarding the information. They're not like trying to hold back. They're just
[00:50:42] free with it. And then it creates that atmosphere. So I love kind of being in that atmosphere where
[00:50:47] we're all going to succeed. But it's like, all right, let's just put all of our tools in the
[00:50:52] middle of the table. And then you grab out of it, what you want to grab out of it like, you know,
[00:50:59] like a potluck and you're a competitive guy. But I suspect you don't view any other real
[00:51:04] tears or brokerages as competition at all. I suspect you won't, you said this earlier,
[00:51:09] I compete with myself. I want to be the best version of me. Obviously, you're paying attention
[00:51:13] to what other firms are doing, of course, because why wouldn't you? And you want to keep, you know,
[00:51:18] introducing, you know, more and more skills and, and, you know, different avenues, uh, verticals
[00:51:24] to your business. But, um, you're not, you don't see the other agencies as, as, uh, competitors.
[00:51:29] I'm guessing. No, not really because my value proposition is so unique. You know, I'm teaching
[00:51:35] real estate agents how to create multiple income streams. I'm teaching them how to build other
[00:51:39] businesses. I'm teaching them how to invest, you know, I just closed a $45 million apartment,
[00:51:43] $240 units a couple weeks ago. So I'm doing stuff where I can show these guys. And I started
[00:51:49] off my first investment was $275,000 duplexes. So you can scale. That's why I say I went from
[00:51:54] that 10 years ago to a $40, $50 million deal, $70 million deal to $50 million. Um, and there's,
[00:52:00] they're just following the system in the process and the breadcrumbs. But like at eXp, they rank,
[00:52:04] they rank, uh, the personal attractors and out of 87,000 agents. And I've been at eXp now 16 months.
[00:52:11] I'm number 30. I'm in the top 30 already. You know, it's been something we've been there 12 to 13
[00:52:16] years or longer. And in the first year and a half or under two years, I'm already in the top 30
[00:52:21] personal attractors. But I don't really get caught up in being anybody else other than myself.
[00:52:27] And any goal that I said is going to be well beyond any, what anybody can write down for me anyway.
[00:52:32] Yeah. Yeah. You're going to hold yourself to a higher standard than anyone else could. And I
[00:52:37] suspect that is a huge reason you, you, you just have raised your standards. Your standards are
[00:52:42] up here. And they didn't start up here necessarily. They start where everyone starts. And you just
[00:52:47] kept inching your way up to where you're like, Hey, I can run multiple things at the same time by
[00:52:52] scaling. Um, two, two final questions for you. And then I'll let you get back to running your
[00:52:57] empire. And I do, I do consider it an empire because I don't say that as, as just a nice thing to say,
[00:53:02] although it is, I guess a nice thing to say, but it's, it's really true. I mean, you're doing a lot
[00:53:06] of different things successfully, um, which any one of those things is difficult. And the fact
[00:53:12] that you do them all simultaneously with with a lot of help, of course, is, is just truly remarkable.
[00:53:18] Two questions. One is every, every agent I know, again, focused on the, on the present and the near
[00:53:26] future is freaking out about 2023, right? We're like, okay, rates are where they are. This is, this is
[00:53:32] bad. Now, I'm not, I'm not saying it's bad. I'm saying this is, this is what the, the mentality is.
[00:53:37] A lot of fear, a lot of anxiety, a lot of, um, sort of paralyzed, uh, agents going, I,
[00:53:45] oh, next year, it's going to really be rough. What are you telling? What are you coaching your agents
[00:53:51] to think about? Because we can't control rates. We can't control inventory. We just can't. But
[00:53:55] there are things that are within our control. What are, what are you telling people to do to focus
[00:54:00] to have a successful 2023? Yeah, it's, it's really cool. Like I said, I'm an, I'm an enigma, man,
[00:54:08] people can't figure me out. I'm just, um, you know, I got my real estate license in the, in the middle
[00:54:12] of the downturn, I started an investment company in 2008. So the worst time to start an investment
[00:54:18] company and he did it. The worst, um, especially to start a brokerage. Um, so I look at this,
[00:54:25] just like Warren Buffett says, he says real estate recession or stock market downturn or what is it,
[00:54:34] recession proof? Yeah, well, the real estate market, not a bear market, but a bull market,
[00:54:40] bull market, there we go. Sorry, couldn't get it out. He says, it's the only time that when
[00:54:45] something's on sale, people don't run the buy. I know it's funny. You know what I mean? So like,
[00:54:50] but if it's a first Friday or what is it? Black Friday, you can't even, you get trampled getting
[00:54:54] in the back. So I tell people, you got to switch the mindset and it always starts with the mindset,
[00:55:00] right? When I, when everything and that's when I'm always evaluating, it's my mindset,
[00:55:05] where it needs to be in order for me to go to that next level because you can have all the
[00:55:08] processes you want, but if you don't have the mindset to receive going to a billion dollars
[00:55:13] in sales or having 500 people in your organization or whatever it is, it's not going to be sustainable.
[00:55:18] You may get there, but you're going to go backwards. So what I'm telling my real estate agents
[00:55:24] is look at the opportunity that's in hand. Study your hyper local market. Is it REOs? Is it new
[00:55:32] builders? Because builders were fine when they were getting 18 offers, but now their agents might
[00:55:36] have gotten lazy, but they have to still keep selling housing. I picked up five builders in the
[00:55:42] 2012-13 range just because I was doing what their agents had got touted of doing. Man, I started
[00:55:49] having these builders hire me. That's when I started scaling. You get 40 houses per build or 20
[00:55:54] houses, 30 houses. So you just got to think about, look at your hyper local market and find those
[00:55:59] opportunities. Is it expires? Is it orphanless? An orphanless is just a list that goes past 90 days.
[00:56:06] It's been expired. People forgotten about it. And then you just create a value proposition
[00:56:11] to second to none. And you pick up that market share because the market share is not going
[00:56:15] away. It's just going to trade hands. So if we have the hunter mentality that we're going to go
[00:56:22] hunt and we're going to go create a value proposition to second to none and a brand to second to none,
[00:56:26] that's when we'll take that market share. And it's just a mentality shit. Right? And last
[00:56:31] minute, you're not worried about 2023 at all. You're just pivoting. Pivoting, pivoting. You
[00:56:41] who is like not legitimately freaked out. And I think what you said made absolute perfect sense.
[00:56:49] Yes, we'll just change. We'll look over here as opposed to over here and we'll make it work.
[00:56:54] I'm sorry. And go ahead. No, you hit it on the head. You picked up on it because true stands
[00:56:58] the test of time. When you hit true, you just like, well, there it is. Right? Like, whoa, there it
[00:57:03] is. And so I think once again, while people resonate with my message is because it's not a
[00:57:08] blow, it's me. It's not. I'm scared. I don't operate out of fear. I operate out of solutions.
[00:57:14] And at the end of the day, I'm going to say it to be truthfully honest. I think there's a lot of
[00:57:21] people who have not been coached right. And when they realize they need the right coaching,
[00:57:26] they're going to come to people like me and I'm going to give them the confidence and the tools
[00:57:30] to be a competent agent. I call it the three C's. Competence creates confidence.
[00:57:37] But if you got into industry in 16, 17, 18, whenever and you're getting 17 offers,
[00:57:42] you never really sat down and created the competence. But now you got to go create the competence.
[00:57:47] Yeah. And nobody likes a confident person who isn't competent. In fact, we all laugh at those
[00:57:53] people. We dislike them. Confidence needs to be earned through competence. And I think,
[00:58:00] so here's my last question. My final question. This will be a tougher one, maybe not.
[00:58:06] What would you say to your 22 year old self or 23 year old self, as you're exiting your
[00:58:15] football career? What do you wish you would have known then that you didn't know, but you do know now?
[00:58:20] I think even bigger than I thought. And I was a pretty big dreamer and think,
[00:58:27] yeah, you were ready a big thing here. And yet you were thinking too small back then is what you're
[00:58:32] saying. Yeah. I remember A&M came to me going my junior year and I remember them talking to my
[00:58:37] parents about a high-zemy campaign. I was really playing that well at the time. Reggie Bush was
[00:58:43] doing really well and Darren Sproles. And if you look at our numbers, my numbers are just as good as
[00:58:48] some of his numbers. He won. He had a win in the high-zemy. And I remember A&M was talking about
[00:58:52] at some point coming to my parents about a high-zemy campaign. And in my mind, I was like, me,
[00:58:56] high-zemy winner, receiver, it takes in him. And so I still beat myself up about that because I'm
[00:59:03] like, you should have accepted that. And they're like, yes, I am a high-zemy. I can't be one of the
[00:59:09] I am one of the best players in the in the nation. And those are just those moments of life that
[00:59:14] I pull on now. And now when I think about an idea, I'm like, it's possible. And whatever it is,
[00:59:20] five eggs in your mind, and then go for that. Well, it's as simple as that. It's not easy,
[00:59:29] but it's simple, right? Like, I guess that's the point. It's hard, but simple. This idea of being
[00:59:36] able to think bigger allows you, it expands your capability, right? It's a simple idea, think bigger.
[00:59:46] And then the hard work comes in of trying to figure out a way through it, but you're absolutely
[00:59:50] right. We are, and we all know this, we're limited by our beliefs. You know, that old joke of like
[00:59:56] what is BS stands for belief systems because it is sort of an old joke, but it's true. We're all
[01:00:02] wrapped up in our own BS, our own belief systems. And when then you meet somebody like you who's
[01:00:07] who seemingly doing things outside of what we believe is capable, but you've been doing that your
[01:00:13] whole life. And so you have this track record of like, oh, yeah, I got paralyzed. Yeah, that wasn't,
[01:00:18] I mean, I got through it. First, you know, I got into, you know, I got into college. I got into,
[01:00:23] you know, playing a pro sports. You did all the things that were already impossible. So I imagine
[01:00:29] when challenges come your way, it probably doesn't decimate you. Like maybe it would somebody who
[01:00:35] hasn't had some of those those challenges along the way. One final question, how important is failure?
[01:00:42] And when I mean failure, I don't mean, you know, I just mean not achieving the goal you set out for
[01:00:48] and how important, because I have, I have a theory or at least I've talked to a lot of agents
[01:00:54] who say they love failure because most of the things they do don't end up working out, but it just
[01:01:00] take, it just carries them over to the next thing that eventually gets them closer to working out.
[01:01:05] So how often you seem like a guy who never fails at anything, I would love to know what role
[01:01:11] this failure play in your life and how do you think about failure? Man, that's a good question.
[01:01:16] It's a great final question. I think as I think about failure, I always say it's wins and lessons.
[01:01:21] There are no wins and losses. It's only a loss if you quit. So I'm either going to win or I'm
[01:01:29] going to learn the lesson. I'm only win and I'm going to lose if I quit. And so as long as you keep
[01:01:36] going, there was a Martin Luther King, and I know I'm going to butcher it, but he says, if you can't
[01:01:40] fly then run. If you can't run, then walk. If you can't walk, then crawl. But by all means, keep going.
[01:01:50] There you go. Boy, I'm not going to do better than Dr. Martin Luther King. So I'm going to leave it there.
[01:01:57] One of the greatest thinkers of all time, and you perfectly summed that up. I think that's
[01:02:03] absolutely right. And also the scoreboard of life or on the field is only the scoreboard. Even if
[01:02:09] you're victorious, it doesn't necessarily mean you played your best, right? And I'm sure you probably
[01:02:14] had games where you lost, but you played your best. And yes, it's no fun to lose. But to know that
[01:02:21] I did my best is really all that ever really ultimately matters. Or at least in my opinion,
[01:02:27] that's what I found is that you know, you can you can win on the scoreboard. But if you didn't play
[01:02:31] your best, you just don't feel that good about that victory, right? So this idea of showing up like
[01:02:36] you've said, be your best self. I know it's said a lot in our society, but actually measuring what
[01:02:42] does it mean to be at my best? What does that actually look like? Boy, Terence, you gave so much
[01:02:47] great wisdom on this episode. I need to get you back to, well, you need to get back to running your
[01:02:52] empire. And I have taken up too much of your time. So thank you for spending as much time on our show

Has broker it. If that wasn't amazing enough, Terrence has brokered 1.1 billion in sales volume over the last 10 years. He currently owns 20 companies, actually more than 20 companies, under the Terrence Murphy company's brand. And Terrence is an investor in more than 30 companies as a venture capitalist.

His businesses continue to grow and his clients to receive superior service to learn all about Terrence. And by the way, he has a podcast that he just launched as well because of course he does he does everything. But I want you to learn all about Terrence at his website, which is Terrence Murphy.

Man, sorry about the long intro. My team sent you. But at the same time, they always laugh because they're like, well, how are you doing so much? We have to make the intro, I saw it. So it's fun, man. Thank you. Great job. Thank you. No, thank you. And I love reading long intros like that. Well, sometimes people it is funny. Sometimes people we interview will send us things that we have to pair down because they're like, OK, nobody cares about this and that. Everything that you guys sent over was things I'm like, I have to talk about all of this because this I think it was very concise. You just do a lot. And I think that I'd love to talk to you about the fact that you run so many different businesses, you have so many different interests. You're a busy, busy guy. And at the same time, running the successful real estate practice. But before we get to sort of where you are today, I'd love to learn a little bit more about how you got to where you are today. So I love our audience to hear about your football career and then how you transitioned into real estate. Yeah, man. So born and raised in East Texas grew up with a single mom. And so for all the kids that grew up with single moms, for all you real estate agents that are single moms, I love you. And I'm proud of you. And so yeah, I just grew up with a single mom. She put a lot into me, encouraged me, pushed me, and was very hard on me. And that's the way that I've become who I am. As an entrepreneur and as a student athlete and as a professional athlete. And then just having the heart to help, right? Because I've lived that life where we went not having everything. And so I just have the mentality to try to help them. We talked about early DJ life is like a boomerang, right? What you put out, you get back. And not only do you get it back, you get it back with precision. And so for many years, I've encouraged real estate agents. I've coached them. I've pushed them. I've given them tools. And now I've been able to see the benefits from those seeds that I set as people that started to join my organization at eXp, like crazy. So it's been cool. But yeah, that's grew up there. Went to Tixan M, football scholarship. I drafted by the Green Bay Packers with Aaron Rogers. And back to back in the film, he pees as my roommate, my bro. And he's killing the game. And then I retired and moved into real estate. And just grew a passion for it. And to start off as a developer and investor, got my license with the killer Williams for a year, which we all do. Left up rings, started an independent brokerage T and five. I told people I was going to scale my independent startup brokerage. This was in my early 20s with no experience. I did seven transactions when I started T and five. And I said, I'm going to scale it to a billion sales in ten years. I actually did it in eight. And people were like, there's no way you're in a small town. It's not possible. You need a franchise. And we did. And that's that's how I got in real estate after retiring from the NFL. It's it's incredible. And I know you're skipping over about a million steps along the way. But I love the fact that that here you are. And this idea of scaling is so, so important, especially now where I see agents flocking to teams. Teams have become more and more important, more and more prevalent, more and more attractive. I think over the years. And we're seeing this flock to teams and I'm hearing, well, I'm interviewing a lot of people for the show and also just here for our brokerage in Chicago that are struggling with scaling, trying to figure out how do I go from being like an individual producer to running a team, then to scaling the team. And those are different skill sets. And was that difficult for you to go for, you know, you, well, you said you, you were just done seven transactions. You're like, I'm building a team. I'm going to, I'm going to scale this thing up to a billion. Well, let me ask you a different question. What gave you the confidence to think that that was possible within 10 years? Because it really shouldn't be possible, at least, you know, to the sort of logical mind, right? This shouldn't be possible, yet you did it. And you did it faster than you thought. So what gave you the confidence and the courage to do that when really all signs were pointing to, it's going to take longer than that. Yeah, or even be possible at all, right? I think for me, that goes back to just that background of, you know, I told people when I was five years old, I remember having a picture of me. My mom bought me like one of those little uniforms, and that was my Christmas gift. And I remember telling people like, five, I'm going to make it to the NFL. And so can you imagine from five to 22 for 17 years, you're telling people something that is merely impossible if you look at the numbers? Absolutely. I mean, it literally is no way different from a number standpoint. You should make it to the NFL. And so not only to make it, but to make it in the first two rounds. So I had already been there before, right? Holding onto a dream that coaches, opponents, family members, teammates, whoever tried to talk you out of like, hey, that's not possible. It's not real. You might want to do something different. And you just keep fighting for it, man. You keep holding onto it because you know within your heart is possible. So when I achieved that dream at 22, I tell people, I'm okay with playing the long game. It took me 17 years to achieve a dream, right? And when I tell people one day, like I said, hey, I'm going to go D1 in college football. Well, at that time, this is a crazy DJ. My sophomore year, I was the only sophomore in varsity. We went O and T. We didn't win one game. My junior year, we went one and nine. So going into my senior year, we were one in 19. Yeah. We hadn't signed a D1 recruiting 10 years and I'm telling people I'm going to go D1. And I ended up leaving my high school with 20 D1 offers. And then I actually had about seven bull-riding academic offers to like Rice University, UNC places like that. So I've been there before. So in my mind, when I feel it and pray about it, I'm like, that's what I'm doing. I don't even think about the other option of not doing it. And I would say put me in a desert, I'll find my way to the water. That's just the way I'm wired. And I think that's what people are seeing now as I'm growing one of the fastest organizations. And the history now, VXP, is because I'm giving people the roadmap to get there and get there with the right tools. Yeah, boy, that is, you just said so much in such a short period of time there because really you talked about perseverance. You talked about singularly focused, like almost like horse was when they put the blinders on. It's like, hey, I'm going to achieve this. And there's certain things that are outside of that were really outside of your control, right? You talked about the record in high school, like not great, not your record, but just the overall team record. There's no history of D1 players in any recent history from that school. Yet you did it. And I'm guessing because you were singularly focused, I imagine. And if you hadn't of been drafted second round, I imagine that really wouldn't have changed much for you anyway because you would have just pivoted and pointed your north star at something else and made that successful. I imagine is perseverance. How important is that to you? I mean, I imagine it's got to be pretty important. Perseverance is very important, but what I will tell you is the great thing about athletics, the great thing on growing up with a single mom, the great thing with my background is day and in day out, you have to get up and you have to work. I had successful businesses as an entrepreneur in middle school. Like when I was 12 years old, I had like different businesses that I was running. And so just the mentality of I don't wake up with the, oh, it's not possible. I'll wake up with, okay, how am I getting there like right now? What steps do I have to take day in and day out? Like there's a great book of Tom McHabbits, right? It's just love a Tom McHabbits. Oh man. And so I think the reason why, you know, I've been coaching Real Estate Agents now for 10 years. And two things I always said no to is people would ask me to come train their agents. And I would say I can't do it. I don't have a coaching business or can I invest in your Real Estate projects. I didn't raise money and I didn't have time to teach. So I would just teach my agents. But as I've now started expanding my coaching services, people have blown away. But the athlete and me and the coaching me, I can give you very practical tools that it doesn't sound like, man, I got to do all of that to get there. It's like, no, just do this for the next 30 days. And once we get to 5 million in volume over the next year, and here's how you get to 10 million. And here's how you get to 18. One of the things I took pride in is I'm real big on studying statistics. And once I see statistics and then I say, okay, the average agent closes seven to 10 deals a year per year. How do I five extra with my team and my brokerage? And so for the 10 years that I ran an independent brokerage, we average 39.5 transactions per person. So our per person production was at 40 deals per person. It's amazing. And so we were so focused on just everybody being very successful versus just growing the numbers. Wow. I mean, it's, it's, it is truly incredible. And you're right. This idea of seeing what is possible, because there are people that do this, right? Like you're not the first guy to 5x, you know, a team's production. Although you're probably one of the first people to do it, but you're probably not the first. There's other people that have done this. You can study some of their habits. Oftentimes you could just reach out to these people and ask. That's what I do on the show. I'm reaching out to you right now to share, you know, your secrets with, with our audience. So it is incredible. How important was it, you know, you've been, you've had coaches, you know, throughout your entire academic life, you know, starting from as early as, as when you really got into athletics as a young man. And then all the way through, you know, high school, college, professional, professional, athletic athletics. And then how important is it to be coachable? Because of course, you, you, you have the perseverance. You've got the discipline. But having a coach, how important is that? I think the biggest misnomer about coaches that really shocked me because when we, from 15 years old, on, I kind of got removed from the world. Right? Like when we were on campus at Tixet, and like we, they like had us like overheated, like a wave. Right. Your day is planned out. And when you get to NFL, like you see us playing, but no one really gets to personally interact with you. So when I got introduced back into the world at 22 years, all the 23 ones are retired. I was just blown away at the unwillingness to be passionate about what people do every day. It was like, where am I at right now? Life, because we had the best doctors, the best marketing people, the best publicists, the best everything, the best nutritionists. So I just miss being around greatness. And that's what I wanted to create. And I think the biggest misnomer with that is that all coaches or all mentors have the right playbook. Sure. Because there's a lot of broker owners. And that's what blew me away. They became broker owners because they were not good real estate agents. That's true. It's like, let me hide behind the desk and say, I don't want to sell real estate. I just want to be a broker. Well, you would not sell in a lot of real estate anyway. And so it blows me away. And it's like, hey, after the new year, we want to lose 10 pounds and we show up. And our trainer is out of shape. Well, then I got the wrong trainer. So I'm always telling people, man, when you look at getting a broker or a mentor, a team leader or a sponsor at eXp, really make sure they have the successful track record and that they can communicate it in bicepices pieces to you to follow the breadcrumbs to success. And that's one of the things that I take a lot of pride in building out the processes and the procedures to help people have the same or more success than I have at. Yeah, I think that's right. And you're a coach. Do you also still continue to get coached? I'm sure people would love to hear that if you do or not. I don't. But here's where I find my coaching and my wisdom. In my bottle, and then I'm a book, I'm a book guy. I love tangible books. And then I just got into podcasts. So that's really where my books is like my life line. Like I read my books. I'm doing a 52 week challenge right now with my organization at eXp. So we're reading one book a week every week. Wow. And then we meet in the room five days a week because I do everything by five. We meet in the room five days a week in clubhouse and we go over that book. So there's a lot of accountability there. And it's been really good, man. So their digest is so much information at a rapid pace. And that's been life changing for us. Do you have as so far as there been one book? And I know you're reading so many that I'm sure they're all valuable. In certain ways. As there have been one, you know, you mentioned atomic habits before. Has there been one in the last, you know, however long you've been doing the 52 week challenge where you read a book once a week that's really sort of risen to the top of like that one spoke to me more than more than the others so far? I'll give you one, but then I got to give you five. Is that cool? Right ahead. So the one I would tell every human being that they need to read is untethered soul. Oh, yes. Untethered soul. Oh my gosh. And then he's got a new version of it. I think living my untethered life. But untethered soul really gave me for your, you know, because as athletes as real estate entrepreneurs as these successful people, right, these brokers, these team leaders, these owners, we have to walk around with our chests out at all times. We got to be peacocks at all times. But some of us are broken, right? And some of us really need to be able to be in a safe place to communicate what we're going through mentally. But you don't, you got to put this mask on every day, right? And untethered soul really breaks that down. And that book is life changing to where you realize like you need to be breathing, doing breathing exercises every day. You know, we talk about hydration and sleep and all that. But when someone's talking about breathing, how important it is. No one's talking about the mental aspect of life to be able to meditate and step away from this nauseous world of information and slow the brain. It reminds me of that expression. It's an old musical expression, which is it's not the notes that make the melody. It's not the notes that actually create the song. It's the space in between the notes. And it's like, oh, yeah, of course, it's the space in between notes. Otherwise, it's just one continual note. And that's the silence that we don't often give ourselves. I find, you know, we have a device in our pocket. I was thinking about this this weekend. I'm not the first person to think about this. I'm not, it's not a brilliant thought. But it's almost like a magic. It's almost like magic. We have magic in our pocket 24, 7. And we can use that to summon up whatever we desire. And you have to be really careful because it's super addictive. And it takes time away from being able to sit alone quietly and think and reflect. Do you make meditation or reflection a regular practice for you? I have. We were taught to visualize as athletes, but we never taught to meditate and breathe. And I think it talked about, you know, in the US, we are the worst at breathing, right? Our posh is terrible. Look at me right now. I need to sit up now. I'm thinking about it, right? And we just don't breathe. We don't breathe well. We're continually throughout the day taking short breaths. And we're not taking deep, long, continual breaths. We're rushing to the next meeting. And I always tell everybody, that's why I started this whole movement. We have to become real estate entrepreneurs. We can't just be REALTORS. We can't just be brokers. We can't just be team leaders. We have to be real estate entrepreneurs. And when we become real estate entrepreneurs, we're creating multiple income streams. We're thinking about legacy, right? We're not just, we're not just building a business for today. We're building a business that will give back to our kids kids, right? We're thinking about other people. And we're thinking about our mental health. We're thinking about the impact we want to leave. That's the real estate entrepreneur piece that I really like win all in on, man. Like we even had a day called Rejuvenate Day. We brought in all my agents. And we brought in a nutritionist. We brought in a trainer. We brought in a psychologist. Like we brought in any of grand coaches. We brought in massage therapists, a yoga instructor. We started off with yoga. And it was a beautiful day. Just like really just putting them outside the box in this place of uncomfortableness to force them to think about these things. And man, I have so many of my agents that still takes me. Man, I'm still using some of the things I learned that Rejuvenate Day. So that's really what I'm focused on. I love that. It's a holistic approach to being successful at business. Because you're really talking about being successful in every area of life. Because if we think of our life as a circle or a wheel, we got to make sure that we're pretty smooth around the edges. We got to make sure that our family life isn't in the toilet. If we're expected to do, you know, but our business life is going great. It's like it all has to be working pretty pretty well. Not that we don't have ups and downs. Because of course every single person does, regardless of their level of success. We all go through things. But this idea of treating not just the business side of it, treating the human side. And you know, the breathing thing is so interesting. Because we all know this. Like we've all heard this a million times. We need to slow down our breasts. We need to take deep diaphragmic breaths. We need to, you know, and yet, I never really realized the benefit until I read some studies on breathing where, you know, I am, I have a lot of anxiety. It's just kind of, you know, part of my DNA or whatever, how I was raised or whatever. But regardless, there are breathing exercises that have been proven to reduce anxiety. And I'm like, oh, this is so great. I don't have to think my way out of it. I could do these deep breathing exercises that are super simple. And it's like, wait a two minutes. And then, oh, my God, I feel better. So it is, it is remarkable. But you're right. Taking short breaths throughout the day. Nobody talks about this in real estate at least. It is really a big, big deal. And athletes are taught how to take deeper, longer breaths because of course, you're also in peak physical condition, which helps. But beyond just working out, you can do this at your desk. You can do this throughout the day. And it really does center. I mean, it's the basis of meditation, right, as breath. So boy, you're saying you're saying a lot of really, really great things that I've had done a lot of these episodes that people don't talk about. I mean, certainly we talk about being physically fit and drinking enough water and eating right. But this idea of breathing and meditating and reflecting, I think we're such a stimulus response world. And again, the phone in our pockets, going to try to grab our attention every few seconds. This is a way to shut that out. So, yeah, let's, oh, before we get, let's talk about your podcast. I know this is new. This is real estate entrepreneur with Terence Murphy. So tell us about it. Yeah, before we go there, I want to make sure that I'm following up for your audience because I tell them I give them five books and I'm real big. Oh, I'm sorry. Yes. More books. Yeah. So untethered. So, why the rich get richer by Robert Kielzaki. It's great book. Atomic Abyss, which we talked about earlier, traction by Gino Wakeman. So you got those four. And then good to great. Those would be the five I would have people read. And as we pivot to the podcast, I think more than anything, people realize that they need more, especially real estate agents. And you've been through a downturn. I would say a recessive market or a shifting market. I think people will start realizing that again, that they need more. And one of the things that I teach my agency, Sweat Equity versus Check Equity, truly building a business with the right foundation versus just buying leads, right? And we saw open doors, Zillow Redfin. And so the people were just buying those leads. They are in these contracts. Real estate agents are stuck in these contracts. They're paying $2,500 a month, $3,000 a month. And I'm not getting the same. And even beyond that, what happens if and when Zillow is like, you know, we're just going to be our own thing. We're going to have our own agents. We're going to do our own thing. We're good. We're no longer selling leads to agents. That day, and this is just a gasp, that day's coming. So I'm sorry, go right ahead. I interrupted you. No, no, you have the same passion for it as I do. They take our information from us and then sell it back to us. So I'm always trying to empower real estate agents. I have a very, very soft heart in a sense that I've seen so many of my friends. I worked with agents at Colourwoods when I started. I was 23 and they were in their late 70s and 80s still selling real estate. And that's why I would say when have you been to a real estate agent's retirement party? Either get out of the industry or they sell real estate until they don't know what else to do. And that's what I'm creating. I'm creating the real estate entrepreneur movement where like, I'll think about it on a normal real estate transaction. There's about 20 to 22 companies that make money. Title, mortgage, survey, home warranty. I can keep going, right? Inspection appraisal, yeah, etc. It keeps going. So I'm teaching my people in my work how to buy those businesses and get owner distributions. I'm teaching them how to invest in real estate, how to start their first investment portfolio. Because my wife and I have bought commercial strip centers. We bought multifamily. We've done neighborhoods. We're developing neighborhoods alongside Jack Nicholas right now. And so we've done it and we're teaching people those exact steps on how to create multiple income streams. I want to pause for a moment to talk about our episode sponsor. Our one of my favorite companies out there follow up boss. Now after interviewing hundreds of top REALTORS in the country for this podcast, do you know which CRM is used by more than any other by our guests? Of course it is follow up boss. And let's face it, following up is the key to taking your business to the next level. Follow up boss will help you drive more leads in less time and with less effort. Do not take my word for it. Robert Slack who runs the number one team in the US uses follow up boss. And he is built of one and a half billion dollar business in just six years. Follow up boss integrates with over 250 systems. So you can keep your current tools and lead sources. Also the best part they have seven day a week support. So you'll get the help that you need when you need it and get this follow up boss is so sure that you're going to love their CRM that for a limited time.

But only if you use this special link, visit follow up boss dot com forward slash real. That's follow up boss dot com forward slash real for your free 30 day trial. Follow up like a boss with follow up boss. And now back to our episode. Yeah, it really is the way to go as as somebody who I'm not a broker owner myself. Although I work hand in hand with with our owner here. And he and I have created several ancillary companies to do exactly what you're talking about. You know, because for people who might not be realizing, especially people who want to start their own firm, what you might not realize, at least on the residential side, is brokerage is a very low margin business on its own. And to really make a nice business that might be sellable one day, you need to have these ancillary lines. And also there are just great ways to increase the bottom line in getting involved in title, maybe lending, depending on what state you might be in. You know, like in commission advance, there's a lot of title. It sure, you know, like you were saying, lots of different lines. You're absolutely so right. Because I think people oftentimes want to want to get in, be their own managing broker, have their own business. And they don't realize what the margins actually look like. And then they're like, oh, wow, this is not the this is not like I just broke free from a Keller Williams, which is a great company. But now I'm on my own. I get to keep everything. And it's like, oh, and now I have all these other expenses as well. So it becomes tricky. And but I think you're right. This idea of an entrepreneur is Robert Kiyosaki is sort of the guy who really made this as popular as it is. This is this idea of residual income and creating streams of income that are more predictable. Because as we know, real estate is transactional. It's so odd to me that no one has figured out how to make it a fee-based business, like what financial advisors have done. Financial advisors is the smartest thing ever, which basically said, we're not stock brokers anymore. We're not earning commissions. We're going to pay us 1% or whatever the percent of all the assets under management. Real estate hasn't figured out how to do that. Maybe they never will. So real estate does become very transactional. You need these other businesses just so that you can not freak out on the first of the month every month. Yeah, and hit a wall. It's like this, I'm going to draw, I'm going to create an image one day. I may even create a t-shirt. But it's got these past. And they all have a hamster will at the end. But they make you think that this path is better than that path. So it's like you're a real estate agent, you're a brand new agent. Now you become a top producer. Now you lead a team. Now you own the brokerage. Yeah. You've made it. When in reality, most of the brokers I talk to are the ones that are broke. It's called broker for a reason. And the margins are based. I ran a mastermind of the top broker owners in the world at one point or in the US. And I ran it in the shadows. And no one even knew I started this group. But I told them the one rule I have is, well, too, if you're not going to be here, let me know. And two is we can't talk about this in any public forum. So I was running a mastermind for some of the top brokers in the United States for like three years. No one ever knew about. This is just a we and man, we, I mean, you had Kelo Williams, you had RE/MAX, you had Kyle Wilbanker, Sotheby's, independent brokers in that room. And I coached him every week. And everybody was saying the same stuff no matter what model they were in. They were in. So and I think that's why EXPs, the fastest growing broker in the world. Because it's figured out how to give agents shares and stock. It's figured out how to give them new income streams. And it's it's it's a beautiful model. But I know we were going to talk about the podcast. I wanted to go back and hit those books. Oh, yeah. And no, and thank you for that. And before we get to the podcast, I think, you know, what what eXp did is is really, it's beyond remarkable because they the way I interpreted it is they basically took the Keller Williams model and said it wasn't quite exactly fully realized in the way that Keller Williams. And I'm not picking on Keller Williams. Obviously, they're an amazing company, of course. But basically people left Keller Williams and said, we think there's a better way to do the same sort of thing with, you know, giving people more agency, more ownership. And so they figured it out and holy crap did they figure it out. They are. I mean, it's it's like the results speak for themselves. And anyway, so yeah, let's talk about the podcast. Yeah, last thing on that, I always tell people when they ask me what's the difference. And I know Gary personally, we actually met years ago. We got introduced by Tim Howe. He's a friend of mine from college. One of their top agents. Great for him. Great guy. And we were supposed to meet for five minutes and three and a half hours later. Me and Gary and Josh team, my wife was in the room. It was just us four. She checked out. She's like, y'all go with it. And as you can see how my mind works, I mean, we were just me and Gary were just on the white boards going at it for three hours. Man, he's an amazing dude. Sharp guy. James respect for him. Man, he's a genius. And so I always respect him. And he said, dude, I have 100 and at the time, 80,000 agents, he's like, you're different, you're special. I want to be a part of your story. Anything I can do to help you and Eric let me know. So always respect Gary on that. I will say on the model, I will say you explain it this way. Profit share, if you take a P&L statement, where's profit? It's on the bottle. Yeah. Right. And so this person got to be paid. This person got to be paid. This person got to be paid. And finally, we'll share the profit with the agents. Where usually there's not a lot left. Right. Where eXp flipped it upside down and say, what's on the top of a... We'll pay at the top, yeah. Yeah, it's revenue. Yeah, so that's a difference. But yeah, it's... Yeah, and they figured out how to do it. No one else had figured out how to do that. Now there's a bit of a few copycats that are coming along. Because they're like, hey, this idea of this rev share model works really, really well. So it is truly incredible. Yeah, so let's talk about real estate entrepreneur. What's the goal of the podcast? Who are you speaking to? And by the way, everyone should check it out. We're going to have a link to this directly in the show notes as well so you can subscribe right from the show notes. But tell us about it. Yeah, so when I was thinking about a podcast, my wife has really been on to me about celebrating. Just the overachiever me, chief stuff. I don't even stop to smell the roses. I'm already... It's like the next month, right? I'm just a hunch. And one day she said, you got to celebrate. I said, okay, cool. So we achieved a goal in our 20s that we wanted to achieve, which was buying a strip center. We bought a strip center in North Carolina in Nashville. It's Buffalo, Wyoming, Starbucks, and different tenants. So we took a picture in front of it and I posted it. And like a week later, it had like a million shares. And I was like, what just happened? You know, like, well, how? And people were just so inspired by the story that we told the piece that I posted. And that's when I realized like, what I'm doing and how I'm doing it can help a lot of people. So people started messaging me, messaging me on Instagram, Facebook. And I could not obviously keep up with all the messages. Do you have an e-book? Do you have a book? Do you have a coaching course? Do you have a podcast? And you know, the crazy thing is at the time, I realized, I told them, my wife and said, we don't have any of these. We have no way to help these people. So that's when I said, all right, let's start this podcast. And so instead of naming it real estate, REALTOR, or builder, or broker, real estate entrepreneur kind of embodied everything that I'm doing. But the goal is to go after REALTORS, to go after brokers, to go after builders, go after investors and just let them know. These are the fundamental things you need to be learning, reading about and putting in place in order to scale your business. Because the one thing I'm passionate about is scalability. I know how to scale things and I know how to grow things. And that's something I'm passionate about doing. So that's what the podcast is, real estate entrepreneur, Ruth Tarris Murphy. And I'm just bringing in people to talk about that. Yeah, scalability is really its own skill set. It requires the willingness to probably step away from individual production or to step outside of the constraints of individual production. And which, you know, for anyone who's a real estate agent is probably hyper focused on their own personal production or their team's production. And then trying to say, okay, how do I, how do I want X2X510Xs? And which require a whole set of systems. So your systems, your data and systems guy really at heart. Processing people is what we say in our organizations. Because people are asking, how do you own 20 companies and you're invested in another 30 process in people? And the crazy thing. So go ahead. Go for it, DJ. So I have a question that I'm sure every single person on this podcast is thinking, how does this guy accomplish and do so much? This isn't me giving you a compliment, although it is a great compliment. But it's really how are you able to be a podcaster and entrepreneur, run a brokerage? All, you know, you own lots of properties. You have a team. How is there enough time in the day? So this probably goes back to scalability. But how are you able to sort of keep it all running when most of us you know, are focused in one or two things and we're struggling? How are you able to maintain that focus with all the different, you know, sort of adventures that you're into? And oh, and you're a VC. So we can keep going. You do a lot. How you can do it all? You know, I believe everything we go through in life is to be a part of your story. And when I was 16, my mom had a heart attack. And so at that moment in time, she made it through for a couple more years after. But I was working two jobs in high school. I was the team captain on the football team. I was in honor of society with a 3.8 GPA. So I'd already been learning these tools. And when you at 16, I drove myself to school. I fed myself like I literally was at home by myself. And so you just I kind of became an adult at an early age. And I didn't understand why I was going through that. Like why was it so hard? But looking back, like those experiences happen for a reason. Same thing with my NFL career, I worked my butt off to get there. And I got paralyzed. Man, I got paralyzed from the neck down. I had a really bad neck injury. And just working my way back from something of that trauma, right? And just learning how to use your arms again to walk again. You know, I had neck surgery. And I'm like, why am I going through this? But it's not why it's how can you use it to inspire other people? And how can you use it to be a better version of yourself? That's what I'll tell everybody in my word. You are competing with you. I want you to be the best version of DJ. Everybody else is already taking. So be the best version of you. And in that, my capacity group, my passion for entrepreneurship and real estate group, my one prayer to God when I was in the middle of depression, I mean, deep in depression, at 22 years old, my dream was shaking away from me. I can't walk. I'm in a wheelchair. I'm trying to figure this stuff out. It's just give me a passion God. Give me something that I could be passionate about. And when he gave me real estate, that's when I knew. Okay. So that's why when people, when they hear me speak, or they listen to me, they're like, do you just speak with this different conviction? Because when you're praying to God in the middle of depression and you paralyzed, they God give me a passion. And he shows it to you. There's no way I can't speak with conviction. So as I think through how we are trying to scale, I'm always challenging myself. The foundation of scalability is number one, you. Are you operating with the best version of your time? I call it TBS. Where's my time best spent on a day-to-day basis? So I literally meet with my team probably every other week about my schedule, which people would think, well, you kind of created and leave it, right? Interesting. I meet and I refine my schedule every two to three weeks. And no one will tell you that because no one's doing that, right? But when people ask me, well, how did you learn that? Well, I learned it from, okay, if I'm a wire receiver, and at practice, I'm running this route, right? And I dropped the ball. Well, right after practice, I go right in and I put the tape on. I'm like, okay, if I were to just put my foot here and went this way, it would have made it easier. So I took that. All I did is take life experiences and I translated it into real estate entrepreneurship. So that's why when people are trying to study me, they can't figure me out. I'm an enigma because I'm pulling from life experiences. I'm pulling from books. I'm pulling from things that no one, I've taken the ingredients of my life and made it into a recipe. And now I'm able to listen to you. I can interview DJ. And the first thing if you were going to work and be a part of my team, I would want to know your story. I want to know those points. And I can help you take those ingredients of your life and create it into a successful recipe to skill. So that was a long answer to say, everybody's recipe will be different, but it starts with time blocking. And then once we understand where we're putting our time, how we're managing our time, then it's processing people. And I said, you know, it's so funny because we do want to make this more complicated. We want as individuals to think, oh my gosh, my life is so complicated. And yes, it can feel that way. And absolutely, I'm not here to say that, you know, my life is harder than anyone else is more complicated because of course, everybody's their own unique individual, as their own challenges. But you're absolutely right about this idea that what we have to do is constantly evaluate. And not in a, oh, I'm worthless way, not in a denigrating way, but in a, hmm, where is my time best spent today? Where was my time best spent yesterday? Where did I, you know, where was I not super effective? What's another skill I can learn? Just trying to keep the tools, actually not even sharpen, but adding more tools and more sharp tools to the quiver. You know, this idea of reading 52 books a year, if every REALTOR read five books a year, just five books a year. In fact, read the five that that Terrence recommended. But if they just did that, there would be massive change. Because all it takes is one or two good ideas. And the fact that you're doing 52 books a year is going to scale you up even faster with that knowledge. So it's, but it's also, but there's also a limit to how much time there is. So I'm curious on, so you talked about time best spent TBS. This idea of here's, here's where I can leverage the most growth within the shortest amount of time. And I also want to go all the way back to your story of, you know, you had to become an adult much earlier than a lot of us, right? Because of your situation growing up. That's not an easy thing for a child to have to do or teenager. You did it. You stayed focused. You achieved, you know, your professional goals up until, you know, up. And then your life was a lot of it. Your physical body was taken away from you, really. Just because that happens, things happen. And it's, it's awful. And yet, here you are. You're walking. You're in shape. You're now running these successful businesses. And, but you also said, depression is part of my story too. Like, yes, I am not a Superman. Like, even when, you know, your whole career gets taken away, that's going to put anyone in the massive depression. So I'm curious. And I wanted to ask about one thing about support group, having the support group. And I don't mean necessarily a building that you go into and sit in a circle with other people, although that is a version of that. It could be friends, family, could be colleagues. How important is it for you to have people in your life that you can share intimately and vulnerable, be vulnerable with? And say, hey, guys, I'm going through something right now. I am depressed. And yet, I'm still, you know, I'm still productive. I'm still getting my life together. But this is going on. And this is real. How important is it to have those relationships? And does that help you through the tougher times? Wow, it's good, bro. Man, this is a really good podcast. Yeah. If people aren't listening, they need to rewind this episode. I'm going to go back and listen to it multiple times. So I think it's really cool, man. And you know, the cool thing about it is, I tell people all the time, I don't have a broker anymore. I don't really have a team. I have a tribe. And I always say, you're a vibe or a track, you're a tribe. Yeah. Being you, the authentic you, not someone else. And like, that's going to attract the right people, the energy. And the realness, not fake positivity. Like, I don't want to be on the locker room who's not going to play a snap, walking around, hooping and hollering. Just day in and day out, we see Terrence get up in five in the morning and hit it. And we see him at the office and we see him in the waiting room. Or whatever, wherever you guys are at in your life. Just day in and day out, just getting up and doing the work. But when you hit a wall, because we all hit a wall, you can be vulnerable too. And that's what a true leader and a true, because to me, when you were able to be vulnerable with the right people. And so that's why I say, man, having the right tribe around you and protecting that energy. Like, we're at a place now we literally call it the zero tolerance rule. You can bring me any problem in the real estate team or organization, but it better have a solution attached. Because if not, then you're just complaining. And no one is allowed to bring any negative energy into our space. And if you do, we're going to call you out unless you have a solution attached. And just creating an atmosphere like that, an ecosystem like that, where there's a lot of successful people. But and I tell everybody, leave your pride at the door. No one can come into this space. And when somebody has feedback to help you, have ears to hear and not just ears to reply. Because in so many times, everybody just wants to reply. They're just ready to say something back versus slowing down and truly hearing what the person saying. And I think that's what we're so focused on right now. And in those situations of vulnerability and authenticity and real conversations, we can have a place where we can say, hey, you know what, DJ, thanks for pushing me a couple of weeks ago and really getting on my ass. I know I can do better. But now let's have this conversation. Man, I got a lot going on, man. This is what I got going on. Yeah. That's what yeah, the ability to be honest and to be vulnerable is, is really, I found very helpful when things get tough. Having people around who care and that that you care about, it really helps keep it. But you're right about this idea of problems and solutions. I want to just to go back to that for a second, because that is you just challenged me because I'm a, well, I'm like most people. I'm a complainer. And of course, and there's always things to complain about. Nothing's perfect. There's always, you know, I can complain about myself too, which is also not very helpful. But this idea of complaining is only helpful if you're like, and I think I can figure out a way around or I can ask somebody who's been there before me. You know, like I have a personal trainer you were talking about about being in the gym with a trainer. It's like, I have a trainer because I don't want to hurt myself in the gym. And also, I'm not a professional athlete and I don't know what I'm doing. So I've had a trainer for, I'll probably have a trainer the rest of my life, honestly. And it's not, it's because I need somebody who's like, do this, do this, do this. That's their expertise. I pay them for their expertise and I get the results. If I tried to do, I tried to do it all myself my whole life. I never got to the gym. Rarely, sometimes I'd go, sometimes I didn't. It wasn't, it wasn't just something I was able to do myself. So I had to, I had to find leverage. I had to say, okay, well, if I want to hire, if I need to hire a trainer, I need to make enough money to hire a trainer, which means I need to scale up my business. So I totally understand this idea of looking for solution. And it's not always easy. Solutions are not always, well, they're not always right in front of you. But if you have a good circle of people around, you know, sometimes other people can help you with your solutions too. And this idea of mastermining, we do this, I do the same thing with brokerages. We mastermind with other brokerages that are kind of similar to us all over the country. And like, hey, what are you guys doing right now? Like where are you, where are you guys struggling? What's working? Just doing that alone has helped. I get so many ideas. And I'm sort of shocked that so many real estate agents operate in a silo. They sort of operate in their own little world. They work from home, which I get. They're not really around other agents unless sort of showing or something. And they don't often know, like, there's lots of great ideas out there. And all you have to do is connect with other other REALTORS. What, how important is is having, having sort of people that you look up to, having idols, not idols in the religious sense, but just having people that you respect, having people that you, you know, obviously you're a reader. And, you know, you hung out with Gary Pellor for three and a half hours. Like, that's pretty cool. How important is it for you to get access to these people? And how much time has it saved you by reading something, learning something, having a conversation so that you didn't have to reinvent the wheel? Yeah, I think at this point, if you're a real estate agent, and you don't have someone who's achieved what you've achieved, because always say it's one thing to get inspiration, right? Like LeBron James did a dump there the night I was like, wow, that's awesome. I'm inspired by it. But how is that actually helping me, right? So the one thing I've tried to become, I don't want to just be an inspiration to anybody anymore. I want to be an inspiration that inspires you. But then I want to give you the breadcrumbs and the tools in the roadmap to go achieve the success that you want to achieve. So that other piece of puzzle is what I'm building out right now to truly give people the tools. So now they're inspired by them. So and then I'm inspired, but now I plug in boom. And then I think that's been the great thing now, because of running an independent broker, you kind of feel like you're on an island. So we're now like, you know, that was the thing. I remember going to a cabo my first eXp event and it says making real estate fun again. And I get there and every step I took, I knew a broker from being an independent broker. I just didn't know they were at eXp. So like every step I took, I'm like, whoa, you're here. You're here. It's like a class reunion. I'm like, oh, this is cool. And so yeah, it's just been one of those things where, you know, when you get to a place where everybody is successful, it's like flying with the Eagles. No one's really like hoarding the information. They're not like trying to hold back. They're just free with it. And then it creates that atmosphere. So I love kind of being in that atmosphere where we're all going to succeed. But it's like, all right, let's just put all of our tools in the middle of the table. And then you grab out of it, what you want to grab out of it like, you know, like a potluck and you're a competitive guy. But I suspect you don't view any other real tears or brokerages as competition at all. I suspect you won't, you said this earlier, I compete with myself. I want to be the best version of me. Obviously, you're paying attention to what other firms are doing, of course, because why wouldn't you? And you want to keep, you know, introducing, you know, more and more skills and, and, you know, different avenues, uh, verticals to your business. But, um, you're not, you don't see the other agencies as, as, uh, competitors. I'm guessing. No, not really because my value proposition is so unique. You know, I'm teaching real estate agents how to create multiple income streams. I'm teaching them how to build other businesses. I'm teaching them how to invest, you know, I just closed a $45 million apartment, $240 units a couple weeks ago. So I'm doing stuff where I can show these guys. And I started off my first investment was $275,000 duplexes. So you can scale. That's why I say I went from that 10 years ago to a $40, $50 million deal, $70 million deal to $50 million. Um, and there's, they're just following the system in the process and the breadcrumbs. But like at eXp, they rank, they rank, uh, the personal attractors and out of 87,000 agents. And I've been at eXp now 16 months. I'm number 30. I'm in the top 30 already. You know, it's been something we've been there 12 to 13 years or longer. And in the first year and a half or under two years, I'm already in the top 30 personal attractors. But I don't really get caught up in being anybody else other than myself. And any goal that I said is going to be well beyond any, what anybody can write down for me anyway. Yeah. Yeah. You're going to hold yourself to a higher standard than anyone else could. And I suspect that is a huge reason you, you, you just have raised your standards. Your standards are up here. And they didn't start up here necessarily. They start where everyone starts. And you just kept inching your way up to where you're like, Hey, I can run multiple things at the same time by scaling. Um, two, two final questions for you. And then I'll let you get back to running your empire. And I do, I do consider it an empire because I don't say that as, as just a nice thing to say, although it is, I guess a nice thing to say, but it's, it's really true. I mean, you're doing a lot of different things successfully, um, which any one of those things is difficult. And the fact that you do them all simultaneously with with a lot of help, of course, is, is just truly remarkable. Two questions. One is every, every agent I know, again, focused on the, on the present and the near future is freaking out about 2023, right? We're like, okay, rates are where they are. This is, this is bad. Now, I'm not, I'm not saying it's bad. I'm saying this is, this is what the, the mentality is. A lot of fear, a lot of anxiety, a lot of, um, sort of paralyzed, uh, agents going, I, oh, next year, it's going to really be rough. What are you telling? What are you coaching your agents to think about? Because we can't control rates. We can't control inventory. We just can't. But there are things that are within our control. What are, what are you telling people to do to focus to have a successful 2023? Yeah, it's, it's really cool. Like I said, I'm an, I'm an enigma, man, people can't figure me out. I'm just, um, you know, I got my real estate license in the, in the middle of the downturn, I started an investment company in 2008. So the worst time to start an investment company and he did it. The worst, um, especially to start a brokerage. Um, so I look at this, just like Warren Buffett says, he says real estate recession or stock market downturn or what is it, recession proof? Yeah, well, the real estate market, not a bear market, but a bull market, bull market, there we go. Sorry, couldn't get it out. He says, it's the only time that when something's on sale, people don't run the buy. I know it's funny. You know what I mean? So like, but if it's a first Friday or what is it? Black Friday, you can't even, you get trampled getting in the back. So I tell people, you got to switch the mindset and it always starts with the mindset, right? When I, when everything and that's when I'm always evaluating, it's my mindset, where it needs to be in order for me to go to that next level because you can have all the processes you want, but if you don't have the mindset to receive going to a billion dollars in sales or having 500 people in your organization or whatever it is, it's not going to be sustainable. You may get there, but you're going to go backwards. So what I'm telling my real estate agents is look at the opportunity that's in hand. Study your hyper local market. Is it REOs? Is it new builders? Because builders were fine when they were getting 18 offers, but now their agents might have gotten lazy, but they have to still keep selling housing. I picked up five builders in the 2012-13 range just because I was doing what their agents had got touted of doing. Man, I started having these builders hire me. That's when I started scaling. You get 40 houses per build or 20 houses, 30 houses. So you just got to think about, look at your hyper local market and find those opportunities. Is it expires? Is it orphanless? An orphanless is just a list that goes past 90 days. It's been expired. People forgotten about it. And then you just create a value proposition to second to none. And you pick up that market share because the market share is not going away. It's just going to trade hands. So if we have the hunter mentality that we're going to go hunt and we're going to go create a value proposition to second to none and a brand to second to none, that's when we'll take that market share. And it's just a mentality shit. Right? And last minute, you're not worried about 2023 at all. You're just pivoting. Pivoting, pivoting. You who is like not legitimately freaked out. And I think what you said made absolute perfect sense. Yes, we'll just change. We'll look over here as opposed to over here and we'll make it work. I'm sorry. And go ahead. No, you hit it on the head. You picked up on it because true stands the test of time. When you hit true, you just like, well, there it is. Right? Like, whoa, there it is. And so I think once again, while people resonate with my message is because it's not a blow, it's me. It's not. I'm scared. I don't operate out of fear. I operate out of solutions. And at the end of the day, I'm going to say it to be truthfully honest. I think there's a lot of people who have not been coached right. And when they realize they need the right coaching, they're going to come to people like me and I'm going to give them the confidence and the tools to be a competent agent. I call it the three C's. Competence creates confidence. But if you got into industry in 16, 17, 18, whenever and you're getting 17 offers, you never really sat down and created the competence. But now you got to go create the competence. Yeah. And nobody likes a confident person who isn't competent. In fact, we all laugh at those people. We dislike them. Confidence needs to be earned through competence. And I think, so here's my last question. My final question. This will be a tougher one, maybe not. What would you say to your 22 year old self or 23 year old self, as you're exiting your football career? What do you wish you would have known then that you didn't know, but you do know now? I think even bigger than I thought. And I was a pretty big dreamer and think, yeah, you were ready a big thing here. And yet you were thinking too small back then is what you're saying. Yeah. I remember A&M came to me going my junior year and I remember them talking to my parents about a high-zemy campaign. I was really playing that well at the time. Reggie Bush was doing really well and Darren Sproles. And if you look at our numbers, my numbers are just as good as some of his numbers. He won. He had a win in the high-zemy. And I remember A&M was talking about at some point coming to my parents about a high-zemy campaign. And in my mind, I was like, me, high-zemy winner, receiver, it takes in him. And so I still beat myself up about that because I'm like, you should have accepted that. And they're like, yes, I am a high-zemy. I can't be one of the I am one of the best players in the in the nation. And those are just those moments of life that I pull on now. And now when I think about an idea, I'm like, it's possible. And whatever it is, five eggs in your mind, and then go for that. Well, it's as simple as that. It's not easy, but it's simple, right? Like, I guess that's the point. It's hard, but simple. This idea of being able to think bigger allows you, it expands your capability, right? It's a simple idea, think bigger. And then the hard work comes in of trying to figure out a way through it, but you're absolutely right. We are, and we all know this, we're limited by our beliefs. You know, that old joke of like what is BS stands for belief systems because it is sort of an old joke, but it's true. We're all wrapped up in our own BS, our own belief systems. And when then you meet somebody like you who's who seemingly doing things outside of what we believe is capable, but you've been doing that your whole life. And so you have this track record of like, oh, yeah, I got paralyzed. Yeah, that wasn't, I mean, I got through it. First, you know, I got into, you know, I got into college. I got into, you know, playing a pro sports. You did all the things that were already impossible. So I imagine when challenges come your way, it probably doesn't decimate you. Like maybe it would somebody who hasn't had some of those those challenges along the way. One final question, how important is failure? And when I mean failure, I don't mean, you know, I just mean not achieving the goal you set out for and how important, because I have, I have a theory or at least I've talked to a lot of agents who say they love failure because most of the things they do don't end up working out, but it just take, it just carries them over to the next thing that eventually gets them closer to working out. So how often you seem like a guy who never fails at anything, I would love to know what role this failure play in your life and how do you think about failure? Man, that's a good question. It's a great final question. I think as I think about failure, I always say it's wins and lessons. There are no wins and losses. It's only a loss if you quit. So I'm either going to win or I'm going to learn the lesson. I'm only win and I'm going to lose if I quit. And so as long as you keep going, there was a Martin Luther King, and I know I'm going to butcher it, but he says, if you can't fly then run. If you can't run, then walk. If you can't walk, then crawl. But by all means, keep going. There you go. Boy, I'm not going to do better than Dr. Martin Luther King. So I'm going to leave it there. One of the greatest thinkers of all time, and you perfectly summed that up. I think that's absolutely right. And also the scoreboard of life or on the field is only the scoreboard. Even if you're victorious, it doesn't necessarily mean you played your best, right? And I'm sure you probably had games where you lost, but you played your best. And yes, it's no fun to lose. But to know that I did my best is really all that ever really ultimately matters. Or at least in my opinion, that's what I found is that you know, you can you can win on the scoreboard. But if you didn't play your best, you just don't feel that good about that victory, right? So this idea of showing up like you've said, be your best self. I know it's said a lot in our society, but actually measuring what does it mean to be at my best? What does that actually look like? Boy, Terence, you gave so much great wisdom on this episode.
