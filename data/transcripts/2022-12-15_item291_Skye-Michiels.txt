[00:01:25] [♪ OUTRO MUSIC PLAYING [♪
[00:01:26] Hello and welcome to another episode of Keeping It Real,
[00:01:31] the largest podcast made by real estate agents
[00:01:34] and for real estate agents.
[00:01:36] My name is DJ Paris.
[00:01:37] I am your guide and host through the show.
[00:01:40] In just a moment, we're going to be speaking with Sky Michaels.
[00:01:43] Before we get to Sky, just a quick reminder
[00:01:46] that the best way that you can help our podcast,
[00:01:49] well, a couple of ways, actually two ways.
[00:01:51] So there are two best ways.
[00:01:53] One is to, of course, support our sponsors
[00:01:55] who are nice enough to help us continue funding our show.
[00:01:59] So we love our sponsors.
[00:02:01] Please, we hope you love them too.
[00:02:03] Check out their products and services.
[00:02:05] And then the second best way you can help us grow
[00:02:07] is also by telling a friend our goal is to reach
[00:02:10] as many real estate agents as possible.
[00:02:13] There's 1.7 million of them in the United States right now.
[00:02:17] And I don't think all of them are listeners,
[00:02:18] although we would love it if they all were.
[00:02:20] So help us get one more follower or one more listener
[00:02:23] and turn somebody else on to our show.
[00:02:26] Send them over to our website, keepingitrealpod.com.
[00:02:30] And guys, that's enough for me.
[00:02:31] Let's get to the main event.
[00:02:32] My conversation with Sky Michaels.
[00:02:38] [♪ OUTRO MUSIC PLAYING [♪
[00:02:38] [♪ OUTRO MUSIC PLAYING [♪
[00:02:47] Today on the show, we have Sky Michaels from Compass.
[00:02:51] And let me tell you more about Sky.
[00:02:53] Now, Sky Michaels is here to connect, empower,
[00:02:56] and cultivate kindness.
[00:02:58] He's a dad, an entrepreneur.
[00:03:00] He's an award-winning real estate professional
[00:03:02] and a national motivational speaker.
[00:03:05] Now, currently, he's serving as the national head
[00:03:07] of agent development at Compass.
[00:03:09] And Sky is currently creating a national agent training curriculum
[00:03:13] based on the principle that real estate is more
[00:03:16] about creating connection and caring for people
[00:03:18] than it is about selling houses.
[00:03:20] Could not agree more, by the way.
[00:03:22] Sky is also the founder and host
[00:03:23] of the popular motivation and accountability group,
[00:03:26] the 6AMers, which brings together thousands of agents
[00:03:29] across the country in the early hours every week
[00:03:31] to learn frameworks for developing a healthy mindset,
[00:03:34] reaching their goals, and achieving their own happiness.
[00:03:38] I'm going to give you guys two websites
[00:03:39] that I want you to go check out about Sky first,
[00:03:42] is his personal website, which is sky Michaels.com.
[00:03:45] Michaels has spelled a little differently.
[00:03:47] So there's a link to that in our show notes,
[00:03:49] but it is m-i-c-h-i-e-l-s.com.
[00:03:53] So sky within e Michaels.
[00:03:55] Anyway, just click on the link in the show notes.
[00:03:57] But also, I want you to check out his 6AMers
[00:04:00] Accountability Group and Podcast.
[00:04:01] You can find that anywhere, podcasts, or serve.
[00:04:03] But go to his website, the 6AMers,
[00:04:06] and it's in the number 6amers.com.
[00:04:08] Google it, you'll find it.
[00:04:09] I'll also have a link to that in the show notes.
[00:04:12] Sky, welcome to the show.
[00:04:13] Thank you so much for having me.
[00:04:15] I'm thrilled to be on.
[00:04:16] I wanted to very quickly, before we get into your story,
[00:04:19] I'm sort of going to take over for just a moment,
[00:04:21] which is like super rude and not great,
[00:04:24] not not great etiquette for a host.
[00:04:27] But I wanted, I saw something that really stopped me
[00:04:30] in my tracks and forced me,
[00:04:32] but not forced me, encouraged me,
[00:04:35] and immediately captivated me to learn more about you.
[00:04:38] So we do, obviously, prep for the show.
[00:04:41] Although today I didn't do my prep that early.
[00:04:44] And so I was like, oh my gosh, I have to learn about sky.
[00:04:46] And I went to his website, which is sky Michaels.com.
[00:04:49] And he does something that I've yet to see
[00:04:51] any other person in the real estate industry do.
[00:04:54] And I'm sure other people have done this,
[00:04:56] but this is the first time I've seen it
[00:04:57] in five years of looking at other agent websites
[00:04:59] for people that are on our show,
[00:05:01] after 400 some episodes.
[00:05:02] This is super cool.
[00:05:04] If you go to his website and you go to his about us page,
[00:05:06] he has got something called big moments.
[00:05:09] And what he's basically showing you here
[00:05:11] is different major events in his life
[00:05:13] that are important to him or significant
[00:05:16] to his development or about his personal life.
[00:05:19] And boy, I love this.
[00:05:21] And I just wanted to say, I literally got to learn
[00:05:24] all about your life, not necessarily by reading a bio,
[00:05:27] which I get lost after a while when I read somebody's bio,
[00:05:31] especially if it's really long.
[00:05:32] But I loved this because I could see pictures
[00:05:34] of each event in your life.
[00:05:35] And then if I hover over, I can read more about it.
[00:05:38] I was like, wow, I really feel like I know this guy.
[00:05:40] And I thought, what a great idea for other REALTORS to do this.
[00:05:44] So please, everyone go to his website sky Michaels.com,
[00:05:47] go to his about us page and just check out
[00:05:48] how he really gets intimate and vulnerable
[00:05:52] and says, here's what's been most important to me in my life.
[00:05:56] I think it is super cool.
[00:05:57] So I just wanted to give you some kudos before we,
[00:05:59] before you start to talk to him.
[00:06:01] Yeah.
[00:06:01] Well, I think it ties back into the philosophy
[00:06:04] that I have around real estate too,
[00:06:06] that real estate is about people.
[00:06:08] And how many every REALTOR that you've seen or that you go,
[00:06:13] and you go to their about page,
[00:06:14] it's words and words and words.
[00:06:16] The reality is like, no client looking at me,
[00:06:19] it wants to read all that, right?
[00:06:22] But when they see a visual and they see a picture
[00:06:25] of like divorced, you know what I'm doing?
[00:06:28] What I'm doing right there is,
[00:06:30] hey, I'm explaining who I am as a person.
[00:06:33] In addition, I'm also creating potential connection
[00:06:38] with the person like, oh wow, like they had read paragraph
[00:06:41] and paragraph and paragraph, you know,
[00:06:43] eventually maybe they get to it,
[00:06:45] but the visual of that and you know,
[00:06:48] the visual of my children or the visual of me
[00:06:50] rowing in college or whatever it might be,
[00:06:53] you connect a lot easier.
[00:06:54] Our brains are wired to connect visually.
[00:06:57] Much quicker than we are when we read something.
[00:07:00] So that was sort of the mindset around it
[00:07:02] was I really wanted in a very, very quick situation
[00:07:06] and illustrate who I am as a person,
[00:07:08] mainly because I want to connect with you as a person as well.
[00:07:12] Yeah, it almost felt like I was,
[00:07:14] it was almost almost like a mini Instagram,
[00:07:17] most important moments of your life in a weird way.
[00:07:21] It's just, it's like I don't have to infinitely scroll through.
[00:07:24] A million of your Instagram posts,
[00:07:26] I can literally just see the top 12 things
[00:07:29] that have happened that are significant.
[00:07:31] And you really do talk about everything on there,
[00:07:35] which I think is courageous.
[00:07:38] And a great example of leadership,
[00:07:42] the ability to say, hey, not everything in my life
[00:07:45] has been easy and perfect.
[00:07:47] And here are some of the challenges
[00:07:48] and here's all I ever came to them.
[00:07:49] And I just, I'm really impressed by that.
[00:07:51] And it encourages me to want to be more forthright,
[00:07:55] with my own story as well.
[00:07:57] And by the way, I'm a divorce guy too.
[00:07:58] And as soon as I saw that, I was like, okay, I feel,
[00:08:01] I did, I felt a little corrected you.
[00:08:04] I don't have children you do.
[00:08:05] So I wasn't able to connect in that way.
[00:08:07] But I was like, oh, I'm a divorce guy.
[00:08:10] That's not really something we like want to,
[00:08:12] we go around bragging about in a way or announcing.
[00:08:15] But of course, half the people in this country are.
[00:08:18] And so even things like that,
[00:08:19] I thought was really, really good.
[00:08:21] So, and I really think it goes back into owning your story,
[00:08:24] right?
[00:08:26] The best REALTORS are authentic.
[00:08:30] And authenticity is the most powerful thing we have
[00:08:33] in real estate.
[00:08:33] It's your authentic self.
[00:08:35] And when you own your story,
[00:08:37] you're showing up as your authentic self.
[00:08:39] And very similarly, when someone is looking at you online,
[00:08:43] you don't know what they're gonna connect with.
[00:08:45] I didn't know if you were divorced,
[00:08:47] but now we have a connection.
[00:08:50] And imagine if I was showing up to a listing
[00:08:52] appointment at your house,
[00:08:53] you already feel like you know me a little bit
[00:08:55] and you have a connection.
[00:08:57] And maybe it was the college drawing
[00:08:59] or maybe it was the children or maybe it was the,
[00:09:01] we don't know.
[00:09:02] But now I'm putting my story out there.
[00:09:04] I'm saying this is who I am as a person.
[00:09:06] And now it allows you to connect in your terms
[00:09:10] rather than me trying to force my terms on you.
[00:09:13] I don't know if that makes sense.
[00:09:14] It makes perfect sense.
[00:09:16] And also this idea of vulnerability
[00:09:19] is really the gateway to connection.
[00:09:21] And you are vulnerable on this.
[00:09:23] And I like that because so many people
[00:09:28] are desperate for connection.
[00:09:30] And but it's scary to get vulnerable.
[00:09:32] It's scary to put your story out there
[00:09:33] because of course, people can judge you for it
[00:09:36] or people can have a reaction that isn't what you want.
[00:09:39] But you were saying it's my story.
[00:09:41] This is what it is.
[00:09:42] And but people love that.
[00:09:44] I love it.
[00:09:45] I love the anyway.
[00:09:46] So we'll move on.
[00:09:47] Because I could talk about that all day.
[00:09:48] I think that is such a great example of who you are
[00:09:52] is the willingness to put something like that out there
[00:09:56] I think is a really great indicator of your character
[00:09:59] and also where you're at in life.
[00:10:01] But let's start all the way at the beginning of your story
[00:10:03] because I really want to hear about how you got to where
[00:10:05] you are now.
[00:10:06] So how did you get started in real estate?
[00:10:09] So I was a teacher.
[00:10:12] So I graduated from Syracuse University.
[00:10:14] I knew from a very early age I wanted to be a teacher.
[00:10:17] I loved it.
[00:10:19] And I was inspired by some of my teachers like most teachers are.
[00:10:23] And I graduated in 2000 when my master's degree
[00:10:27] and I became a high school history teacher.
[00:10:29] And unfortunately, I realized very quickly I was poor.
[00:10:33] So as a teacher.
[00:10:35] So I needed a side business.
[00:10:37] And most teachers have a little side thing.
[00:10:39] They paint their movers or they coach
[00:10:42] or whatever it might be.
[00:10:44] And I had a conversation with a teacher who was just about
[00:10:48] to retire and he said, if I could go back and do it all
[00:10:50] over again, I would get my real estate license
[00:10:52] and sell real estate part time and then teach full time.
[00:10:55] You get the best of both worlds.
[00:10:56] So I was like, sure.
[00:10:57] So I went online, Googled real estate schools,
[00:11:00] found the closest one.
[00:11:02] And I literally got my license in.
[00:11:05] It was one of those like all weekend classes.
[00:11:08] So I got it four weekends, got my license,
[00:11:10] and I was a REALTOR.
[00:11:12] And I started selling and I always intended it
[00:11:16] in the beginning to be a part time thing.
[00:11:18] Like I thought it was just gonna be something
[00:11:20] I sell for five homes a year,
[00:11:22] make a little extra money and be a teacher
[00:11:24] the rest of my life.
[00:11:26] And I'm also a former college athlete.
[00:11:29] So I'm a little competitive.
[00:11:31] So I got into it and actually loved it.
[00:11:34] Because I think it reminded me of sports, right?
[00:11:37] Like if you work hard, you actually get a return here,
[00:11:40] right?
[00:11:42] And there was a piece of my soul
[00:11:45] so to speak that missed that competition, right?
[00:11:48] You every day of your life as a college athlete,
[00:11:50] you're competing and then you leave it.
[00:11:52] You're like, okay, that's over.
[00:11:54] And now I was back in a competition mode.
[00:11:57] And I just, I loved it.
[00:11:58] I'd gravitated into it up.
[00:11:59] I was successful and I literally did both for three years
[00:12:03] as a part time agent because of the fact that I grew up,
[00:12:06] you grew up craving stability.
[00:12:09] Like I did five years,
[00:12:11] they're a key university in my opinion,
[00:12:13] the best school out there, you know?
[00:12:15] But at the end of the day,
[00:12:17] like you go to school for five years,
[00:12:19] become a teacher and you achieve it.
[00:12:21] And I'm gonna leave it to go sell houses
[00:12:24] at a hundred percent commission.
[00:12:26] And it was probably probably difficult in a sense too
[00:12:30] because I imagine with teaching,
[00:12:32] sometimes there's a calling,
[00:12:34] like it's like I feel drawn to do this.
[00:12:36] You obviously could have chosen any career,
[00:12:39] Syracuse is a great university.
[00:12:42] And so you could have chosen any path
[00:12:43] and did you feel called to teach?
[00:12:45] Was that like part of?
[00:12:47] Totally.
[00:12:48] And the last year I stayed,
[00:12:50] the last year I literally stayed because of the fact
[00:12:53] I didn't wanna leave the senior class so that was teaching
[00:12:56] because I've done with them all four years.
[00:12:59] And it's a relationship.
[00:13:00] It's a relationship.
[00:13:01] It's a relationship.
[00:13:02] And care about those kids, sure.
[00:13:03] Exactly.
[00:13:04] And then on the surface,
[00:13:05] when you look at real estate on the surface,
[00:13:07] it actually, it feels very,
[00:13:09] especially nowadays with like all the housewives
[00:13:11] and the HTTB stuff, right?
[00:13:13] It feels very like.
[00:13:15] And what I've discovered though within real estate
[00:13:18] is all the skills I applied as a teacher,
[00:13:20] I can apply in real estate.
[00:13:22] And that's what made me successful
[00:13:24] between caring about someone,
[00:13:26] learning about who they are,
[00:13:27] making sure I could explain everything properly,
[00:13:30] making sure they really, really understood the process, right?
[00:13:35] All the skills of a teacher applied so closely
[00:13:37] to me being a REALTOR,
[00:13:39] as long as they then applied sort of that confidence
[00:13:42] and the sort of the drive you have as an athlete as well,
[00:13:46] when those came together,
[00:13:47] it really made me who I was.
[00:13:49] So I did both for three years
[00:13:50] and then finally in 2005, when full-time real estate.
[00:13:53] And it was maybe the decision that,
[00:13:56] you know, that this was gonna be my career.
[00:13:58] And then now you're in,
[00:14:00] you're a corporate guy now.
[00:14:02] Now you're part of a,
[00:14:03] you're part of the biggest real estate company out there
[00:14:06] right now.
[00:14:06] So you are the national head of agent development
[00:14:09] at Compass and everybody knows Compass, of course.
[00:14:12] I would hope by now everyone knows Compass.
[00:14:15] And you know, they just,
[00:14:16] they just are crushing it everywhere.
[00:14:19] And obviously Robert Reffkin's a really impressive guy,
[00:14:22] of course, and you guys are always in the news
[00:14:23] and always a lot going on with Compass.
[00:14:25] How did you get to Compass?
[00:14:26] Just out of curiosity.
[00:14:27] Yeah.
[00:14:28] So over the course of my career, you know,
[00:14:30] I was an individual agent in 2005 and over in 2012,
[00:14:36] I created my real estate team.
[00:14:39] And it was called Real Estate with Heart, you know,
[00:14:41] all about caring and caring about people, et cetera.
[00:14:44] That team, I grew that team into one of the top teams
[00:14:47] in the Philadelphia market at the time.
[00:14:50] I was with Keller Williams,
[00:14:51] which I love Keller Williams.
[00:14:52] It's such a great company,
[00:14:54] some great trainings and awesome culture, et cetera.
[00:14:58] But I was at the time, I was also craving
[00:15:01] a little something more, shall we say.
[00:15:04] And Compass at that time in 2018 was just starting
[00:15:09] to launch in the Philadelphia market.
[00:15:11] So I remember taking my first recruiting appointment only,
[00:15:14] I was taking it because I was like,
[00:15:15] I'm gonna learn about this company
[00:15:16] so I can recruit against them.
[00:15:18] And a minute when I walked in,
[00:15:21] you're like, wait a minute, they've got everything.
[00:15:23] I don't want to compete with those guys.
[00:15:25] It was that situation.
[00:15:27] I walked into the appointment.
[00:15:29] I met a gentleman named Rob Lehman.
[00:15:32] And at the end of the day in my head,
[00:15:34] I'm like, oh my God, why did I take this appointment?
[00:15:36] Because I literally fell in love
[00:15:38] with the company, the philosophy, the branding,
[00:15:41] the marketing, there are so many aspects that I wanted
[00:15:43] to create, but there was just so many,
[00:15:45] it's so challenging in most real estate companies
[00:15:48] to create it because of the fact that,
[00:15:51] you know, the factors present really hold you back.
[00:15:54] And Compass sort of overcame this really
[00:15:57] because of the fact that they invested
[00:15:59] so many millions of dollars in supporting agents first.
[00:16:04] And that was like this philosophy that I had
[00:16:07] that I really wanted to sort of pursue.
[00:16:09] So at the time in 2018, I came over to Compass.
[00:16:13] I took over as the managing director
[00:16:15] for the city of Philadelphia.
[00:16:17] And my team came over as well.
[00:16:19] My sister ran my team.
[00:16:22] And yeah, we launched in June of 2018
[00:16:25] that I came over in August of 2018.
[00:16:28] And it was an awesome ride.
[00:16:30] And then over the years, the teacher and me started to come out.
[00:16:33] And really, this is accentuated in the pandemic.
[00:16:37] So I'd been doing a little bit of national teaching
[00:16:40] that are retreats and things along those lines
[00:16:43] in the pandemic hits, right?
[00:16:45] So March of 2020, hard to remember it,
[00:16:47] but everything shut down.
[00:16:50] And we're sitting there like, what do we do?
[00:16:53] And immediately myself and a group of probably about 13
[00:16:56] or 14 other people were formed
[00:16:58] and we launched a thing called Coaching at Compass,
[00:17:02] which was all virtual training.
[00:17:04] So every single day, all we did was we did
[00:17:07] all of this virtual training.
[00:17:09] The other thing was I was drinking a lot, eating a lot,
[00:17:14] watching Netflix a lot, we would have our virtual happy hour.
[00:17:19] And then you're like, all right, six o'clock,
[00:17:22] what do I do now?
[00:17:23] My little just watched TV, there's nothing to do.
[00:17:26] And this was in March.
[00:17:27] So the end of April, I launched a group called the Six Amers,
[00:17:32] which was sort of a morning and accountability group,
[00:17:36] just within my market, just within the field of your market.
[00:17:39] So between the Coaching at Compass and the Six Amers,
[00:17:42] I started to work a little more nationally,
[00:17:44] but I was still managing full time as well.
[00:17:47] And then at the beginning of this year,
[00:17:49] I was promoted to the head of agent development
[00:17:51] here at Compass to make a long story short.
[00:17:55] No, it's really impressive.
[00:17:57] You've really come full circle, you're teaching again.
[00:18:00] And also, you're obviously super engaged
[00:18:04] in the real estate industry and market.
[00:18:07] So before we, I want to get some advice
[00:18:11] because our audience are all REALTORS, I assume.
[00:18:14] I don't know who else would want to listen to our show,
[00:18:16] but we love our audience, of course.
[00:18:19] But we also are here to help educate them
[00:18:22] and help get them ready.
[00:18:23] And for next year, we have a shifting market
[00:18:27] that's already shifted and we just had a fed rate increase
[00:18:30] a couple days ago.
[00:18:32] So we're certainly agents are, well, you know,
[00:18:35] they're stressed, they're worried.
[00:18:37] And I'm super excited to learn, you know,
[00:18:40] what you're telling agents on what to do
[00:18:42] through the end of the year, all the way into 2023.
[00:18:45] But before we do, let's get to your podcast
[00:18:48] because I always wait till the very end to sort of say,
[00:18:50] oh, and by the way, he's got this.
[00:18:52] And then, you know, not as many people make it to the end.
[00:18:54] So I want to make sure we get that out there right now.
[00:18:57] So tell us about the Six Amers.
[00:18:59] Yeah, so the Six Amers, once again,
[00:19:01] it was formed in April of 2020.
[00:19:03] And the mindset, it actually was the originally,
[00:19:06] like a couple of years prior, I'd gotten divorced.
[00:19:09] And one of my really good friends,
[00:19:10] a guy named Jake Dreyfus at Keller Williams,
[00:19:14] I was struggling, I was in a bad place.
[00:19:17] Sure.
[00:19:17] You can see this on the left.
[00:19:18] I've been there, I know.
[00:19:20] Yeah, it's bad.
[00:19:21] It's even in the best of scenarios, it's bad.
[00:19:24] Yes.
[00:19:24] And I've a beautiful divorce, by the way,
[00:19:26] I have a great relationship.
[00:19:28] 
[00:19:28] It's like, you know, my kids are,
[00:19:30] we have great beautiful 50, 50 custody, et cetera.
[00:19:33] But going through it, it rocks you.
[00:19:35] So Jake would, he said,
[00:19:37] hey, I'm going to start texting you early in the morning.
[00:19:40] 5am, we followed a guy named Jocco Willenick,
[00:19:42] who's like, sure, sure.
[00:19:44] Yeah, of course.
[00:19:45] So by the way, for anyone who doesn't know who Jocco Willenick
[00:19:48] is, he's got a million books.
[00:19:50] He's a crazy, what X Navy seal or.
[00:19:53] Maybe he's a little bit.
[00:19:54] Yeah, I guess you're never an X Navy seal, I shouldn't say.
[00:19:57] It's like disrespectful.
[00:19:58] I didn't mean it to be, he's not.
[00:19:59] But anyway, he's an X Navy seal and this guy is hardcore.
[00:20:04] And he's all about discipline.
[00:20:05] And anyway, go correct it, I'm sorry.
[00:20:07] So Jake and I formed a group called the 5 Ambers, right?
[00:20:10] We woke up the 5.
[00:20:11] Couple days a week, we'd get on a Zoom call.
[00:20:13] We actually launched it like nationwide.
[00:20:16] It was really cool.
[00:20:17] Actually, the Facebook group still exists today.
[00:20:19] Jake's one of my best friends today.
[00:20:21] But you know, he moved to Colorado.
[00:20:23] I went to Compass, like, you know,
[00:20:24] so we, it's just sort of sort of settled in, I guess we could say.
[00:20:29] So in the pandemic, I sort of just revived it as the 6 Ambers.
[00:20:33] A, it was a pandemic, so you didn't need to get up at 5 Am.
[00:20:36] And 6 Am is also that hour that really allows
[00:20:38] it to be accessible to everyone.
[00:20:40] Yeah, 5 Am is a little tough.
[00:20:42] Yeah, it's a little hard.
[00:20:43] If you're not like a crew guy, a swimmer,
[00:20:46] like an early morning person, a paperboy,
[00:20:48] right?
[00:20:49] Right, 5 Am is just, it's not healthy as well.
[00:20:52] 6 Am was a great time.
[00:20:53] And to make a long story short, what we do is,
[00:20:57] Tuesdays and every month you sign up and you commit
[00:21:00] to doing one goal for the month, you wake up at 6 Am,
[00:21:05] and you get on a Zoom call on Tuesdays and Thursdays.
[00:21:09] And I usually will interview someone motivational on the Zoom call.
[00:21:12] And then I'll put a post, I'll post a question of the day
[00:21:15] on Monday, Wednesday and Friday and the workplace,
[00:21:18] which is our internal Facebook system that you need to answer.
[00:21:22] And then we also read one book of the month.
[00:21:24] And the goal is, let's create a community around
[00:21:28] sort of waking up early and really taking care of ourselves.
[00:21:32] Because at the end of the day is REALTORS.
[00:21:34] What do we do all day, every day?
[00:21:36] What makes it successful is we take care of other people.
[00:21:39] And that's good during the day because of the fact
[00:21:42] that's what makes you successful.
[00:21:44] The challenge we have as REALTORS is that usually
[00:21:47] that spills over into the early morning
[00:21:49] and in the late evening because of the fact
[00:21:52] that we are always on email and texts and social media.
[00:21:56] And we literally wake up, for the moment we wake up,
[00:21:58] it's the moment we go to bed, sometimes we're on our devices.
[00:22:03] So the goal of the six Amers is really the state of people
[00:22:06] that you don't need to be all things to all people at all times
[00:22:09] early in the morning.
[00:22:11] Early in the morning is your problem.
[00:22:13] That's for you.
[00:22:14] And we coin to term, we call healthy selfish,
[00:22:17] that you need to be selfish in a healthy way early in the morning.
[00:22:22] You don't get on the phone.
[00:22:23] And everyone is different, right?
[00:22:25] For some people it's working out, for some it's meditating,
[00:22:27] for some it's reading, for some people it's folding laundry
[00:22:30] because it makes you feel like you're in control.
[00:22:33] Whatever it is that you need to do for yourself,
[00:22:37] that's selfish, but it's healthy selfish.
[00:22:40] That's really what we try to preach.
[00:22:42] And we want people to wake up with a little bit of motivation,
[00:22:45] a little bit of positivity, a little bit of inspiration
[00:22:47] early in the morning to carry them throughout the day.
[00:22:51] Now, is this open to only Compass agents
[00:22:54] or can anyone apply for this?
[00:22:57] It's a great question.
[00:22:58] So it is right, the live group is only Compass agents, right?
[00:23:02] Because of the fact we use internal communication systems,
[00:23:05] et cetera.
[00:23:07] And over the years, I had hours and hours of interviews
[00:23:10] that I recorded.
[00:23:11] And my mom, my mom, can you send me that interview
[00:23:14] or like, you know, people would say,
[00:23:16] hey, can you send me the interview?
[00:23:17] I want to send it to my kids
[00:23:19] and it really, it got to the point where I was like,
[00:23:22] I've got to put this out publicly
[00:23:23] because there are so many great inspirational moments
[00:23:26] and interviews and a lot of there's people
[00:23:30] within Compass but people outside of Compass as well
[00:23:32] that we interview.
[00:23:33] So I was really motivated to put something out there
[00:23:36] that the world could actually see inside what we do
[00:23:40] as a group and gain inspiration from it as well.
[00:23:43] And I'll say it's obviously, it's a lot of REALTOR
[00:23:47] as well we have a lot of staff members in there
[00:23:48] and the podcast really is not about REALTOR per se.
[00:23:52] It's really about you as an individual and a person
[00:23:54] and how do you get inspired and really take care of yourself.
[00:23:59] So podcasts can be listened to by anyone.
[00:24:02] So we'll have a link to that in the show notes,
[00:24:04] again, called 6am or number six.
[00:24:07] And if you want to be part of the actual accountability group,
[00:24:10] that's limited to for currently to the Compass agent.
[00:24:13] So a lot of our listeners are Compass agents.
[00:24:15] So if you don't know about this,
[00:24:17] this is a great time to sign up.
[00:24:19] But let's talk about right now what's going on
[00:24:23] because of course everyone's focused on what's right
[00:24:26] in front of them which is some challenging times, right?
[00:24:30] We had, well, they're challenging times in relation
[00:24:32] to what we had a couple of years ago.
[00:24:35] And I think that's an obvious thing for people
[00:24:38] to think back and go well, that was easy, this is hard.
[00:24:42] But if we think back maybe a couple of years ago,
[00:24:45] even at 3% interest rates,
[00:24:47] I don't know that it was so easy.
[00:24:48] I think if you were working with buyers,
[00:24:50] we all remember it was not easy.
[00:24:52] If you were working with sellers, you had a great run.
[00:24:55] But now things have changed and we're now,
[00:24:58] rates are of course are much higher.
[00:25:00] Obviously business still needs to continue,
[00:25:02] people still need to move.
[00:25:04] And but yet I'm part of our local association here.
[00:25:09] And I work on some committees that deal with programming
[00:25:13] around helping agents get through this current time.
[00:25:16] And boy, everybody I know is a little bit stressed.
[00:25:19] So as you know, so I'm curious on what you're telling agents
[00:25:25] or what you're seeing out there,
[00:25:27] how are successful agents sort of continuing to stay focused?
[00:25:31] Are they putting the blinders on
[00:25:33] and just kind of doing the things they were always doing
[00:25:35] or are they are people pivoting?
[00:25:37] Just curious to get your thoughts on what you're seeing.
[00:25:40] Well, the first thing I'll give everyone
[00:25:42] is that the solution to anxiety is action.
[00:25:46] But if you right now are feeling anxious,
[00:25:49] anxiety is all about unknown things in the future.
[00:25:52] And what happens when we feel anxiety is we get,
[00:25:55] we sort of get frozen in place,
[00:25:58] almost picture the deer in the headlights, right?
[00:26:01] And we don't move.
[00:26:02] And that is not a good thing right now.
[00:26:05] So if you're out there and you're hearing this
[00:26:07] and you feel anxiety,
[00:26:09] my challenge to you is what are the actions
[00:26:12] that you need to take in order to move forward, right?
[00:26:15] Get out of the headlights, get out of the blind spot,
[00:26:18] get out of that frozen mode.
[00:26:19] Because the reality is there are real estate transactions
[00:26:22] that are rehabbed, there's millions of transactions
[00:26:25] that are gonna happen.
[00:26:26] But in this moment when you feel that frozen mode,
[00:26:29] that anxiety is gonna kick in and it's gonna paralyze you.
[00:26:34] And if you are not in a mode of action every single day,
[00:26:38] then you are literally going to sort of slide backwards
[00:26:41] and it's gonna get really, really hard.
[00:26:43] For successful agents and what I'm coaching everyone,
[00:26:46] this is an opportunity.
[00:26:49] We have a massive opportunity right now
[00:26:52] as professional agents to capture market share
[00:26:56] and elevate what we do.
[00:26:58] In two years ago, a year ago, let's be real.
[00:27:01] If the property was priced right and you had it in the MLS,
[00:27:05] like it probably would be.
[00:27:06] You had to do, yeah.
[00:27:08] So at the end of the day, our role as an agent
[00:27:12] or an I like calling us like advisors
[00:27:14] and consultants around real estate sales.
[00:27:16] At the end of the day, we weren't able to fulfill
[00:27:20] our greatest potential because of the fact that
[00:27:23] it was, the market was so crazy,
[00:27:25] it was so fueled with low interest rates
[00:27:28] and low inventory, it was hyper-grouch, right?
[00:27:32] It was not natural.
[00:27:34] And so now we're moving back to a world
[00:27:36] where there is an opportunity for us to elevate
[00:27:39] what we do as REALTORS and to elevate what we do
[00:27:41] with an industry to actually embrace that role
[00:27:44] as the advisor and the consultant.
[00:27:47] And I really am coaching agents right now
[00:27:49] to figure out everything you can do to be in action.
[00:27:53] And when you think about like the last two years,
[00:27:55] a lot of agents probably didn't work in their CRM.
[00:27:58] They didn't update their contacts, they didn't reach out.
[00:28:01] They didn't have those great touch points
[00:28:04] that made you successful, right?
[00:28:06] All you did was you did transactions,
[00:28:09] you showed properties, you listened to homes
[00:28:10] and you were so busy and so frenetic
[00:28:13] that you were just running so fast.
[00:28:16] Well, we have an opportunity now to take a step back
[00:28:19] and we're still gonna work as hard.
[00:28:21] We're just gonna work in a different manner
[00:28:23] because the reality is the millions of transactions
[00:28:26] that are gonna happen in this real estate industry
[00:28:29] are gonna happen to people
[00:28:30] that have real life situations.
[00:28:32] But if we are not in a relationship with these people,
[00:28:35] what are they gonna do?
[00:28:36] They're gonna click on a link online
[00:28:39] and then they're gonna get connected to someone
[00:28:40] that's paying lots of money to a third party company.
[00:28:43] And the reality is we need to be reaching out to people
[00:28:46] we know in a human manner, in a manner
[00:28:49] that develops our relationships.
[00:28:52] So when that advisory role comes up,
[00:28:55] we are elevated and they reach out to us for help, right?
[00:28:59] When you think about financial advisors,
[00:29:02] your financial advisor is constantly in touch with you
[00:29:06] hopefully about your portfolio and what you should be doing.
[00:29:09] And the reality of real estate transaction
[00:29:11] happens once every seven, eight, 10, 15 years.
[00:29:15] But-
[00:29:15] So there's a lot of lead time in between.
[00:29:17] And what most agents do is they don't remain
[00:29:21] in their clients' lives as an advisor
[00:29:25] around real estate beyond the transaction.
[00:29:28] And our-
[00:29:28] I can pause, can I pause for a second?
[00:29:30] I have a theory about this.
[00:29:32] Number one, obviously, so we're talking about
[00:29:34] the time in between sales, which I think is maybe,
[00:29:38] is not even maybe, it is more important
[00:29:40] than when you're actually working with the client.
[00:29:42] Because as you said, this is, I mean,
[00:29:45] we've all seen the stats, the, I don't know,
[00:29:47] depends on what study you look at.
[00:29:48] But the certain number of people,
[00:29:50] certain percentage of people literally forget
[00:29:51] who the REALTOR was like three years after the transaction.
[00:29:54] My parents are this way, it took them,
[00:29:56] they had a home in North Merdle Beach,
[00:29:59] and it took years to sell it,
[00:30:00] because it was just kind of weird timing, whatever.
[00:30:02] Anyway, it took years and many different REALTOR's
[00:30:04] to finally sell this property.
[00:30:06] Finally, somebody did it after like five years
[00:30:08] of this brutal, but they finally did it.
[00:30:10] And my parents were like, oh, thank God,
[00:30:11] somebody finally got it sold.
[00:30:13] And my parents are super grateful to this person.
[00:30:16] I was asking my dad not that long ago,
[00:30:17] this is a couple of years ago, but I said,
[00:30:19] who was making a REALTOR?
[00:30:21] Because I thought maybe I had a lead out there.
[00:30:23] I was just gonna say, he goes, I don't remember.
[00:30:25] And my parents like this person,
[00:30:27] and they couldn't remember.
[00:30:28] Now they don't live in North Merdle Beach,
[00:30:30] you know, they're never gonna do another transaction there,
[00:30:32] but still, that was shocking to me.
[00:30:34] And I went, oh yeah, I'm in the industry,
[00:30:36] of course, that makes sense.
[00:30:36] People don't stay in touch.
[00:30:38] And what you said, I think is really important.
[00:30:39] So here was my thing I was gonna suggest
[00:30:42] for anyone out there that's going, okay, like Sky was saying,
[00:30:45] now's the time to think about,
[00:30:47] how can I deepen my relationships with my connection
[00:30:50] to these people?
[00:30:52] Well, that sometimes is the challenge.
[00:30:54] They might go, I don't know what,
[00:30:56] am I supposed to just call once in a while?
[00:30:58] Or I don't, I know they're not.
[00:30:59] They just moved in a year ago.
[00:31:00] What am I gonna do?
[00:31:01] I could call them and say, like, what's going on?
[00:31:02] Or how you doing?
[00:31:03] And that's fine.
[00:31:04] But what I've always suggested,
[00:31:05] especially you talked about your CR,
[00:31:07] like really getting your CRM updated,
[00:31:09] I think now is the time to call everybody you know,
[00:31:13] especially now if you have some extra time
[00:31:14] and you probably do,
[00:31:16] call everybody in your database.
[00:31:18] And literally just update the information.
[00:31:20] Be like, hey, I'm working on my marketing thing
[00:31:21] for next year.
[00:31:22] I just wanna make sure I have all the right data for you.
[00:31:24] Find out their birthdays.
[00:31:26] Find out their anniversary if they're married.
[00:31:28] Find out, you know, where they work.
[00:31:29] If you don't know, you know,
[00:31:31] and this gives you, find out what their children names,
[00:31:34] ages, maybe even birthdays too for that.
[00:31:36] So this way, if you have that information,
[00:31:38] you now have six, seven reasons to pick up the phone next year
[00:31:42] already automatically built in to your calendar, right?
[00:31:45] You're like, have the ability to pick up the phone
[00:31:47] and go, hey, it's your wedding anniversary.
[00:31:48] Just wanted to say happy anniversary.
[00:31:50] Anyway, I was just thinking like,
[00:31:52] this is the time to get that data in there
[00:31:54] so that you have all those touch points built into your calendar.
[00:31:58] So true.
[00:31:59] Well, and I think to agent struggle with this,
[00:32:01] what do I say?
[00:32:03] And I think the reality is because of the fact
[00:32:06] that we're looking at that former client
[00:32:08] as a client, not a human being.
[00:32:11] And when you go back and let's bring it back
[00:32:14] to the beginning of our interview, right?
[00:32:15] Like my website, you look at it,
[00:32:17] you get an idea who I am as a human being.
[00:32:19] And I think this is a technique you can also,
[00:32:22] so use as you put a touch point to do
[00:32:23] what I call reverse social media.
[00:32:26] So social media, Instagram and Facebook,
[00:32:28] they give us what they want us to see.
[00:32:31] But we have the ability to go in and actually look
[00:32:33] at what's happening in our client's lives.
[00:32:36] And when you ask yourself the question,
[00:32:38] well, what should I say?
[00:32:39] Well, what's happening in their life?
[00:32:40] And reach out about it, right?
[00:32:42] Give them a compliment, give them a peace gratitude,
[00:32:44] or you can just say, and this is one of my favorite scripts,
[00:32:48] was you, it's a text or an email and you just say,
[00:32:51] hey, I'm just going through my records.
[00:32:52] I saw your name and it made me smile.
[00:32:54] Just want to say hi, no need to respond back.
[00:32:57] Just letting you know.
[00:32:58] Oh, boy.
[00:32:59] And again, we want to emphasize only do this
[00:33:02] if somebody's authentically makes you smile too.
[00:33:05] Because people are going to smell something
[00:33:08] that isn't honest.
[00:33:09] But you are so absolutely right,
[00:33:11] is using social media as almost research and development.
[00:33:15] You can literally just, again, don't wait for the feed
[00:33:18] because Facebook's only going to serve up things
[00:33:21] that they think you're going to want to see.
[00:33:22] You're not going to really get a good sense
[00:33:23] of everything that's going on in someone's life.
[00:33:25] So go through, type in their name,
[00:33:27] see what, see if they've been on vacation,
[00:33:29] lately see what's going on with their kids.
[00:33:31] And then my suggestion is, don't,
[00:33:33] you can always comment on posts and that's great
[00:33:35] and that's definitely better than doing nothing.
[00:33:37] My suggestion is pick up the phone and call or text,
[00:33:39] be like, hey, man, just saw you got back from Cancun,
[00:33:41] hope you had an amazing trip.
[00:33:43] Like, that's the sort of stuff that people go, wow.
[00:33:46] Yeah, the other brilliant gem I'm going to give you as well
[00:33:49] is ask for help.
[00:33:51] Yes.
[00:33:52] I'm coaching next week.
[00:33:54] I'm actually coaching this within Compass
[00:33:56] and we're going to basically be giving,
[00:33:59] we have thousands of agents signed up
[00:34:01] that's I'm really excited.
[00:34:03] But it's five days of giving is the challenge.
[00:34:06] So I'm going to be basically showing how gratitude
[00:34:08] but the first thing is agents are going to reach out
[00:34:11] to their clients to say, hey, we're developing a recipe book.
[00:34:15] Do you have any Thanksgiving recipes that you love
[00:34:17] that I could share in this recipe book?
[00:34:20] And everybody has at least one.
[00:34:22] And even if they don't, what they're going to say is,
[00:34:25] oh, I don't have anyone but that's awesome.
[00:34:27] Can you send me that when you're done?
[00:34:29] Absolutely.
[00:34:31] And now you have a digital recipe book
[00:34:34] that you can send out instead of just the corny,
[00:34:37] hey, hope you're having a Thanksgiving,
[00:34:39] the blast email blast we all get, right?
[00:34:41] Like the turkey.
[00:34:42] I'm thankful you're one of my clients or what if not?
[00:34:45] Now, like, and when we,
[00:34:48] if your parents got a Thanksgiving recipe book
[00:34:50] from their REALTOR, like as a,
[00:34:52] it's awesome, right?
[00:34:53] Now we got to get beyond the transaction.
[00:34:56] We got to think of like, what are my clients going to need?
[00:34:59] And the key aspect of asking for help
[00:35:02] is people like helping other people.
[00:35:05] And now, and you're not asking for help in a bad way,
[00:35:08] you're asking for help in a good way.
[00:35:09] Imagine a neighborhood guide.
[00:35:11] You ask your clients, hey, I'm building a neighborhood guide.
[00:35:14] Do you have a favorite restaurant in Chicago or in?
[00:35:19] Everybody has one.
[00:35:20] Whatever.
[00:35:20] Right?
[00:35:21] And now, what are you doing?
[00:35:22] You're interacting with your clients,
[00:35:23] your former clients in a human way.
[00:35:26] And what do you, and it's all about being present
[00:35:28] in their mind in a positive manner.
[00:35:30] Because while they may not buy or sell a house every 10 years,
[00:35:34] how many people do they know in those 10 years
[00:35:38] that are going to buy or sell?
[00:35:39] And what you want to do as an agent,
[00:35:41] you want to create raven fans that when you say,
[00:35:44] who is your REALTOR?
[00:35:46] My clients, they say, oh my God, Sky, you've got to call them.
[00:35:49] Like, here's his number.
[00:35:50] And let me text him right now.
[00:35:52] Because of the fact I'm present in their lives in a manner
[00:35:55] that is nothing to do necessarily with real estate,
[00:35:57] but everything to do with real estate, if that makes sense.
[00:36:00] Totally.
[00:36:02] Now, after interviewing hundreds of top REALTORS
[00:36:04] in the country on the show, do you know what CRM
[00:36:07] is used more than any other by our amazing guests?
[00:36:09] Well, you guessed it.
[00:36:10] It is follow up boss.
[00:36:11] So let's face it, following up is the key
[00:36:13] to taking your business to the next level.
[00:36:15] Follow up boss will help you drive more leads in less time
[00:36:18] with less effort.
[00:36:19] Don't take my word for it.
[00:36:21] Robert Slack, who runs the number one team in the US
[00:36:23] uses follow up boss.
[00:36:24] And he's built a one and a half billion dollar business
[00:36:27] in just six years.
[00:36:28] I am sure Jonathan is hot on their tail.
[00:36:32] But follow up boss integrates with over 250 different systems.
[00:36:35] So you can keep your current tools and lead sources also.
[00:36:39] They have seven day a week support.
[00:36:41] So you'll get the help that you need and get this follow up boss
[00:36:44] is so sure you're going to love their CRM
[00:36:46] that for a limited time, they're offering keeping it real
[00:36:49] listeners a 30 day free trial, which is twice as much time
[00:36:52] as they give everyone else.
[00:36:54] And oh yeah, no credit card required.
[00:36:56] That's how confident they are that you're going to keep using them.
[00:36:59] But only if you use this special link, which is visit followupboss.com
[00:37:04] forward slash real.
[00:37:06] That's follow up boss.com forward slash real for your free 30 day trial.
[00:37:11] Follow up like a boss with follow up boss.
[00:37:14] Boy, I'm just absorbing what you did.
[00:37:16] I realize what I need to do is create content from our listeners.
[00:37:21] I never have asked our listeners to contribute to the show.
[00:37:25] I asked the tele friend and boy, that is all you ever have to do
[00:37:28] if you're listening is tele friend.
[00:37:30] But I'm thinking you just gave me a great idea.
[00:37:32] I would love to create a list of tips from our listeners
[00:37:36] about what's working for them right now.
[00:37:39] And maybe what is it working?
[00:37:40] That would be kind of cool too.
[00:37:41] But putting that together and just giving that away
[00:37:44] to our audience and saying, hey, here's all the stuff
[00:37:46] that you guys told me.
[00:37:48] So that I love that boy, what a great, some great idea.
[00:37:51] Oh, I love that.
[00:37:54] So what do we think about 2023?
[00:37:57] Here's what we know we know rates are higher than they were.
[00:38:00] I don't want to say high.
[00:38:01] I just want to say higher than they were
[00:38:03] because my parents got their first mortgage.
[00:38:06] It was double digits in the late 70s.
[00:38:09] So again, it's all relative.
[00:38:11] But we know that people are not as happy with rates
[00:38:15] as they were.
[00:38:17] So how are we talking about this, not just rates?
[00:38:20] I just mean, how are we talking to clients right now?
[00:38:23] Or what are you suggesting agents do to really explain
[00:38:27] sort of or rather to sort of set the narrative
[00:38:30] versus what maybe the media is projecting?
[00:38:33] Correct.
[00:38:34] Well, hey, the media is always going to put things out there
[00:38:38] that are going to generate activity, right?
[00:38:41] The reality is that real estate transactions
[00:38:47] based around most real estate,
[00:38:48] transactions around life goals, not financial goals.
[00:38:52] Some true.
[00:38:53] Yeah, we're not talking about investment properties
[00:38:56] and all that stuff like that's a little different.
[00:38:58] But for the vast majority of people that buy or sell real estate,
[00:39:02] they're doing it not because of finances,
[00:39:04] but they're doing it because of life,
[00:39:07] that divorce, birth, job.
[00:39:09] New job.
[00:39:11] 
[00:39:11] Right?
[00:39:12] So the reality is that most people real estate
[00:39:16] to one thing you need, that's an excessive life
[00:39:18] that's also an asset that you need to buy and sell, right?
[00:39:22] Air, water, like you know, not really buying and selling that.
[00:39:25] It's just like sort of natural shelter is an necessity of life.
[00:39:29] So one of the key things that I challenge
[00:39:31] are the real tears that are listening,
[00:39:33] this is find the people that have those life events
[00:39:36] that do have that need and with them work with them on solutions.
[00:39:41] So an entrepreneurial principle we talk about here,
[00:39:44] Compass is be solutions driven.
[00:39:47] When you are encountering a problem within your client's life
[00:39:52] or your transactions, etc.
[00:39:54] The more you focus on the problem, the less you can accomplish.
[00:39:59] The more you focus on potential solutions
[00:40:02] and the pros and cons of each,
[00:40:03] well now you can actually move into action.
[00:40:06] So the bottom line is there's usually a solution to something
[00:40:10] and at the end of the day, that's what we need to drive at.
[00:40:13] There's two one buy downsers, seller held financing.
[00:40:18] There's lots of potential solutions, but what are they?
[00:40:22] Now the one thing, when I think about 2023,
[00:40:26] I went through 2008, I think you might have as well.
[00:40:29] Like, I got in just after that,
[00:40:32] but I've had enough guests on the show
[00:40:34] that have been through it,
[00:40:35] so I feel like I've been through it.
[00:40:37] Yeah, and that was different because there was a nuclear bomb
[00:40:41] that went off underneath our feet.
[00:40:42] This is different because what we're doing here is
[00:40:45] we're just pumping the brakes on the growth that was not healthy.
[00:40:50] It was not healthy to have double digit growth,
[00:40:55] multiple bids, that was not a good thing.
[00:40:58] So what I'm trying to coach REALTORS on
[00:41:01] and also in essence, your buyers and sellers,
[00:41:05] is that you gotta go back into the life goals
[00:41:07] of what you're trying to do
[00:41:09] and then backfill into the finances.
[00:41:12] Start with life, then go finances,
[00:41:14] rather than being like, oh, I just watched
[00:41:16] that thing on box news or CNN and I'm scared.
[00:41:20] Well, that's not how you should make a decision.
[00:41:23] The second thing is that get ready for the bounce,
[00:41:28] meaning this is a little bit of a correction into normalcy.
[00:41:33] And at some point, as rates start to go down,
[00:41:36] the demand is still there.
[00:41:38] We haven't gotten rid of the demand for housing, right?
[00:41:41] We haven't gotten, and the inventory is still
[00:41:43] at all time low, frankly.
[00:41:45] Even as we're starting to increase,
[00:41:47] we're still at an all time low for most markets.
[00:41:51] So the reality is there is probably a little bit
[00:41:54] of a bounce coming.
[00:41:55] We just don't know exactly where that's gonna be.
[00:41:58] And once again, the work you do in the next six months
[00:42:01] will probably dictate the next two years
[00:42:03] of your real estate career.
[00:42:05] Because if you sit there and once again,
[00:42:07] that anxiety kicks in and you just start your hands
[00:42:10] and say, well, I'm just gonna sit here
[00:42:11] and go on Facebook and Instagram
[00:42:12] and give up.
[00:42:16] Well, that's gonna dictate the next two years
[00:42:19] of your real estate career.
[00:42:20] You're gonna live pretty slim.
[00:42:22] Most REALTORS that I'm working with right now
[00:42:23] are so excited because of the fact that they actually
[00:42:27] have time now to help class.
[00:42:30] They have time to work in their serum.
[00:42:31] They have time to take those actions,
[00:42:34] build the Thanksgiving recipe book, frankly.
[00:42:36] You can do the fun stuff now.
[00:42:38] Now's the fun stuff time.
[00:42:39] 
[00:42:39] Exactly.
[00:42:40] And the reality is like, yes,
[00:42:43] it's just about getting better as a professional
[00:42:46] and improving your craft.
[00:42:48] And as you do that, you're going to do more transactions.
[00:42:51] And you're frankly gonna gain a lot of market share.
[00:42:54] Most good agents are actually like,
[00:42:56] oh, here's an opportunity.
[00:42:58] All those like, if you do research in your local market,
[00:43:02] look up, how over the last 20 months,
[00:43:04] how many deals were,
[00:43:06] how many agents did one, two, or three deals in the last 20 months?
[00:43:12] The realities, those agents are gonna be gone
[00:43:13] in the next six months.
[00:43:15] There you go.
[00:43:16] We're already, we have a holding company here at art.
[00:43:19] We have two companies,
[00:43:20] ones for active producing agents.
[00:43:22] And ones we just created for, not every state has these,
[00:43:25] but for people that don't actively produce,
[00:43:27] but want to keep their license active.
[00:43:28] They just want to hang in.
[00:43:30] We in the last, so we have about 700 agents in that company
[00:43:34] in the holding company.
[00:43:36] In the last, or maybe 800 now,
[00:43:38] in the last month, we've added almost 50 agents
[00:43:43] just because people are exiting the business.
[00:43:45] So if you are a producing agent,
[00:43:47] whether you're part time or full time,
[00:43:48] now's the time to really get excited
[00:43:50] because lots of people are leaving.
[00:43:53] That's right.
[00:43:53] And I think too, we'll see this accelerate as dues come
[00:43:56] for like most associations operating on a yearly schedule.
[00:44:00] So you'll see that jump in January, probably as well.
[00:44:04] So it's key.
[00:44:05] And once again, I think it's a positive is
[00:44:08] like there are really solid economics.
[00:44:10] People have equity.
[00:44:12] People, you know, you remember, like,
[00:44:14] I know you just got in,
[00:44:15] I mean, you probably remember doing short sales, right?
[00:44:17] Sure.
[00:44:18] People didn't have equity.
[00:44:20] And banks were foreclosing.
[00:44:21] Like we have a lot of positive economic aspects
[00:44:26] that are going on right now that are good.
[00:44:28] And if you're buying a home,
[00:44:30] the real, this is a really great way
[00:44:32] you can explain to buyers.
[00:44:34] Here are three options.
[00:44:36] There are three things that are going to happen
[00:44:38] with interest rates if you buy today.
[00:44:40] Number one, interest rates are going to go up
[00:44:42] and you're going to be really happy that you locked
[00:44:44] in the 7% or 6% or whatever it is you locked in.
[00:44:49] Number two, they're going to stay the same
[00:44:51] and then you're nowhere soft.
[00:44:53] Or number three, they're going to go down
[00:44:55] and then you're going to refinance into that lower rate.
[00:44:58] So the reality is in either one of these scenarios
[00:45:02] you're going to end up in a good space
[00:45:07] as long as that's a really great way
[00:45:10] that you can explain to buyers right now,
[00:45:12] the fact that interest rates going up,
[00:45:14] it's just sort of the reality of where we are
[00:45:17] as in the interest rate market.
[00:45:20] The reality of interest rates are going to change
[00:45:22] and if they go up and you locked in,
[00:45:24] I remember I just bought a house actually in June
[00:45:28] and I was so pissed and I was like,
[00:45:29] man, I could have locked in.
[00:45:31] You missed out.
[00:45:31] I missed it and now I'm like,
[00:45:34] oh my mind says like, so it changed.
[00:45:37] I was like, oh, thank God I locked in then
[00:45:39] at the 4.25 rate I got.
[00:45:42] I was at the time I was so mad.
[00:45:44] Now I'm thrilled, but the reality is
[00:45:46] no matter where you are, you can explain.
[00:45:49] One of three things is going to happen.
[00:45:51] They're going to go up and you're going to be happy.
[00:45:52] They're going to stay the same.
[00:45:53] You're going to be happy.
[00:45:54] They're going to go down and you've got to pay a little money
[00:45:56] to refinance into the lower rate.
[00:45:59] Yeah, and you brought up something a few minutes ago
[00:46:02] that I just want to step on a little bit
[00:46:04] because it's so important, which is that you said
[00:46:07] most consumers, most buyers and sellers
[00:46:10] aren't thinking about rates.
[00:46:11] They are thinking about their life events
[00:46:13] and funny enough, I just got lucky
[00:46:16] when I bought my most recent condo,
[00:46:19] which just happened to fall in a time
[00:46:21] when the rates were that low.
[00:46:22] That was not the reason I bought.
[00:46:24] It was because this new development came about
[00:46:26] and I was like, I needed to make a move
[00:46:28] and it just so happened that I got lucky with rates.
[00:46:31] It could have been that it was 7%,
[00:46:33] either way I needed to move.
[00:46:36] And so I just got lucky.
[00:46:37] So I think as agents, we often were so immersed in it
[00:46:40] that it's so much of our life
[00:46:42] that we think everyone else is thinking about it,
[00:46:44] but you're right.
[00:46:45] In most cases, people are thinking about
[00:46:47] what they need for their family
[00:46:48] and whatever the rate is is the rate
[00:46:50] and it'll affect what they can afford of course,
[00:46:52] but it's not going to,
[00:46:55] I don't think it's pushing people away
[00:46:57] as much as agents might be talking about it right now.
[00:47:00] Like agents are thinking people are scared
[00:47:02] and they don't want to pay.
[00:47:03] And I'm like, I don't know how true that is
[00:47:05] for the vast majority of buyers and sellers.
[00:47:08] And then you'll feel this about a little bit too
[00:47:12] because right now we probably still have the people
[00:47:14] that we're looking at in the three and four percent rate
[00:47:17] and for those who didn't get in.
[00:47:19] Yeah.
[00:47:20] It is real for them,
[00:47:21] but the people that you will encounter over the next six months
[00:47:25] when they meet you and you do your consultation,
[00:47:27] you explain here's a process,
[00:47:29] here's the payment, here's where rates are.
[00:47:32] For them, that's just where rates are, right?
[00:47:35] And one more thing I was just gonna, before I'm sorry,
[00:47:38] but also too, the people who did buy a couple years ago,
[00:47:41] the last couple of years, probably overpaid by a significant,
[00:47:45] so that's another thing you can bring up
[00:47:47] if somebody's like, well, rates are where they're at.
[00:47:49] Say like, well, let me just show you
[00:47:50] what it would have cost back then to purchase this home.
[00:47:54] And then all of the sudden things get more in line.
[00:47:57] Like, oh, okay, it's not a sky's falling.
[00:47:59] Sorry, I'm so glad.
[00:48:00] No, no, I was gonna almost say the exact same thing
[00:48:03] and the other positives are we can actually do a home inspection.
[00:48:06] We can actually get an appraisal.
[00:48:07] You don't have to buy a site on the same.
[00:48:11] I bought my home with no, I didn't see it.
[00:48:14] I just went off the picture.
[00:48:16] That's amazing.
[00:48:16] I didn't do an inspection.
[00:48:17] I didn't have a mortgage contingency,
[00:48:20] even though I got a mortgage,
[00:48:21] so no appraisal contingency, right?
[00:48:24] And, but I knew what I was doing.
[00:48:26] I'm gonna prefer to see it.
[00:48:27] Because I'm gonna look at it,
[00:48:28] knew what I was basically buying.
[00:48:30] But still, that's scary.
[00:48:31] Very, I'm in the business.
[00:48:33] I was really scared about it,
[00:48:35] but at the end of the day, that's what buyers had to do
[00:48:37] to get a home.
[00:48:38] The positive now is actually,
[00:48:40] I, as a real estate professional, can protect you.
[00:48:43] I can actually do an inspection for you.
[00:48:45] We can do appraisal.
[00:48:46] We can have a mortgage contingency.
[00:48:48] Hey, you need to sell your home
[00:48:50] and buy this one,
[00:48:50] we can actually make a contingent now
[00:48:52] because of the fact we're back.
[00:48:54] What we're doing,
[00:48:55] we're just coming back to the ground.
[00:48:57] This is like, we were, we just,
[00:48:59] it was a rocket that took off.
[00:49:00] And now we're just sort of settling back into the ground
[00:49:03] of what's normal in real estate.
[00:49:06] It's normal for ours to take 60 days to sell.
[00:49:08] It's not normal for it to sell in two or three days back.
[00:49:12] In, you know, 2010,
[00:49:13] you saw the house in two days, you're like,
[00:49:15] woo, that's great.
[00:49:16] You know, no, it's like,
[00:49:17] it's normal for this to take some time.
[00:49:20] And that's what we have to adopt this mindset
[00:49:22] that we are professionals.
[00:49:23] And what we do matters,
[00:49:26] if what we do doesn't matter,
[00:49:28] then the internet companies are just going to take it over
[00:49:30] and do it for us at a cheaper rate, frankly, right?
[00:49:34] Yeah, and they're going to do a better job digitally
[00:49:38] than we can do because that's their business.
[00:49:40] What we can do is all the interpersonal stuff.
[00:49:43] All the we care about you stuff.
[00:49:46] And if you can be the care about you person
[00:49:48] and the I can educate you and reassess
[00:49:53] what's actually going on and re-educate you
[00:49:56] and make you feel cared for and appreciate it
[00:49:58] as a human being, then that's going to win out
[00:50:02] almost every time over the tech.
[00:50:06] That being said, I think this is actually
[00:50:08] perfect place to wrap up.
[00:50:10] So I want a couple of things.
[00:50:12] The six AMers, if you are a Compass agent
[00:50:14] and you want to participate in the accountability group,
[00:50:17] what's the best way that they should do?
[00:50:19] I guess they probably know internally,
[00:50:20] they probably know how to get access.
[00:50:22] I hope so, but just in case you don't,
[00:50:24] you could obviously email me sky at Compass.com
[00:50:27] or you could actually sign up on the website
[00:50:30] as a Compass agent as well.
[00:50:32] And if you are not a Compass agent,
[00:50:34] which of course most people listening are not,
[00:50:36] let's listen to the podcast, subscribe to six AMers
[00:50:39] and get a, still you still get all the interviews
[00:50:43] and all the exciting parts of what sky does.
[00:50:46] And by the way, if you are an agent
[00:50:47] and you are not happy at your current firm
[00:50:51] or just want to see what else is out there,
[00:50:54] obviously Compass would love the opportunity to speak with you.
[00:50:58] There's reach out to your local Compass office,
[00:51:00] you can reach out to sky as well.
[00:51:02] I'm sure you're heading directly to the right person,
[00:51:04] but Compass is really doing some great things.
[00:51:07] And I don't work for Compass and I'm impressed with Compass
[00:51:10] because I just think they do so many,
[00:51:12] so many wonderful things for agents.
[00:51:13] So definitely if you're looking to explore their options,
[00:51:16] except if you're one of our agents,
[00:51:17] stay with us.
[00:51:18] But I'm only being silly, of course.
[00:51:20] But anyway, if you are exploring other options,
[00:51:22] check out Compass, they are actually a bit different
[00:51:25] than a lot of what the traditional big firms offer.
[00:51:29] So check them out, they do a lot of great things.
[00:51:31] So sky, thank you so much for being on the show.
[00:51:34] This was a real pleasure and a lot of fun for me.
[00:51:37] And I won't become a Compass agent only
[00:51:40] because I have my feet are firmly planted here.
[00:51:43] But I wish I was only to be part of your 6 AM group.
[00:51:46] So maybe I'll figure out a way to sneak under the door
[00:51:48] because I need that accountability in my mind.
[00:51:51] So if anyone out there is a Compass agent,
[00:51:54] definitely let's sign up for 6 AMers.
[00:51:56] It's so many people read the Howl Red Book
[00:52:00] of the Miracle Morning, which is like every REALTOR I know
[00:52:03] has read that book.
[00:52:04] This is an extension of that and specific to real estate.
[00:52:08] So anyway, guys, thanks.
[00:52:11] On behalf of Sky and myself, we want
[00:52:12] to thank everyone for listening and supporting our show.
[00:52:15] As I said earlier, please tell a friend,
[00:52:17] that's the only thing that you need to do
[00:52:19] to help us continue to grow.
[00:52:21] And also check out Sky Michaels.
[00:52:24] Everything he offers on the national stage with Compass,
[00:52:28] as well as his 6 AMers podcast and accountability group.
[00:52:31] Go to skymichels.com.
[00:52:32] Link to that in the show notes and also 6 AMers,
[00:52:36] which I apologize, I forgot the website for that.
[00:52:40] Is that 6 AMers.com?
[00:52:41] 6 AMers.com, yeah, perfect.
[00:52:43] And we'll have links to that in the show notes.
[00:52:46] So 6 AMers.com.
[00:52:48] So anyway, Sky, thank you so much
[00:52:50] and we will see everybody on the next episode.
[00:52:52] Thank you, everyone.

My name is DJ Paris. I am your guide and host through the show. In just a moment, we're going to be speaking with Sky Michaels. Before we get to Sky, just a quick reminder that the best way that you can help our podcast, well, a couple of ways, actually two ways. So there are two best ways. One is to, of course, support our sponsors who are nice enough to help us continue funding our show. So we love our sponsors. Please, we hope you love them too. Check out their products and services. And then the second best way you can help us grow is also by telling a friend our goal is to reach as many real estate agents as possible. There's 1.7 million of them in the United States right now. And I don't think all of them are listeners, although we would love it if they all were. So help us get one more follower or one more listener and turn somebody else on to our show. Send them over to our website, keepingitrealpod.com. And guys, that's enough for me. Let's get to the main event. My conversation with Sky Michaels. [♪ OUTRO MUSIC PLAYING [♪ [♪ OUTRO MUSIC PLAYING [♪ Today on the show, we have Sky Michaels from Compass. And let me tell you more about Sky. Now, Sky Michaels is here to connect, empower, and cultivate kindness. He's a dad, an entrepreneur. He's an award-winning real estate professional and a national motivational speaker. Now, currently, he's serving as the national head of agent development at Compass. And Sky is currently creating a national agent training curriculum based on the principle that real estate is more about creating connection and caring for people than it is about selling houses. Could not agree more, by the way. Sky is also the founder and host of the popular motivation and accountability group, the 6AMers, which brings together thousands of agents across the country in the early hours every week to learn frameworks for developing a healthy mindset, reaching their goals, and achieving their own happiness. I'm going to give you guys two websites that I want you to go check out about Sky first, is his personal website, which is sky Michaels.com. Michaels has spelled a little differently. So there's a link to that in our show notes, but it is m-i-c-h-i-e-l-s.com. So sky within e Michaels. Anyway, just click on the link in the show notes. But also, I want you to check out his 6AMers Accountability Group and Podcast. You can find that anywhere, podcasts, or serve. But go to his website, the 6AMers, and it's in the number 6amers.com. Google it, you'll find it. I'll also have a link to that in the show notes. Sky, welcome to the show. Thank you so much for having me. I'm thrilled to be on. I wanted to very quickly, before we get into your story, I'm sort of going to take over for just a moment, which is like super rude and not great, not not great etiquette for a host. But I wanted, I saw something that really stopped me in my tracks and forced me, but not forced me, encouraged me, and immediately captivated me to learn more about you. So we do, obviously, prep for the show. Although today I didn't do my prep that early. And so I was like, oh my gosh, I have to learn about sky. And I went to his website, which is sky Michaels.com. And he does something that I've yet to see any other person in the real estate industry do. And I'm sure other people have done this, but this is the first time I've seen it in five years of looking at other agent websites for people that are on our show, after 400 some episodes. This is super cool. If you go to his website and you go to his about us page, he has got something called big moments. And what he's basically showing you here is different major events in his life that are important to him or significant to his development or about his personal life. And boy, I love this. And I just wanted to say, I literally got to learn all about your life, not necessarily by reading a bio, which I get lost after a while when I read somebody's bio, especially if it's really long. But I loved this because I could see pictures of each event in your life. And then if I hover over, I can read more about it. I was like, wow, I really feel like I know this guy. And I thought, what a great idea for other REALTORS to do this. So please, everyone go to his website sky Michaels.com, go to his about us page and just check out how he really gets intimate and vulnerable and says, here's what's been most important to me in my life. I think it is super cool. So I just wanted to give you some kudos before we, before you start to talk to him. Yeah. Well, I think it ties back into the philosophy that I have around real estate too, that real estate is about people. And how many every REALTOR that you've seen or that you go, and you go to their about page, it's words and words and words. The reality is like, no client looking at me, it wants to read all that, right? But when they see a visual and they see a picture of like divorced, you know what I'm doing? What I'm doing right there is, hey, I'm explaining who I am as a person. In addition, I'm also creating potential connection with the person like, oh wow, like they had read paragraph and paragraph and paragraph, you know, eventually maybe they get to it, but the visual of that and you know, the visual of my children or the visual of me rowing in college or whatever it might be, you connect a lot easier. Our brains are wired to connect visually. Much quicker than we are when we read something. So that was sort of the mindset around it was I really wanted in a very, very quick situation and illustrate who I am as a person, mainly because I want to connect with you as a person as well. Yeah, it almost felt like I was, it was almost almost like a mini Instagram, most important moments of your life in a weird way. It's just, it's like I don't have to infinitely scroll through. A million of your Instagram posts, I can literally just see the top 12 things that have happened that are significant. And you really do talk about everything on there, which I think is courageous. And a great example of leadership, the ability to say, hey, not everything in my life has been easy and perfect. And here are some of the challenges and here's all I ever came to them. And I just, I'm really impressed by that. And it encourages me to want to be more forthright, with my own story as well. And by the way, I'm a divorce guy too. And as soon as I saw that, I was like, okay, I feel, I did, I felt a little corrected you. I don't have children you do. So I wasn't able to connect in that way. But I was like, oh, I'm a divorce guy. That's not really something we like want to, we go around bragging about in a way or announcing. But of course, half the people in this country are. And so even things like that, I thought was really, really good. So, and I really think it goes back into owning your story, right? The best REALTORS are authentic. And authenticity is the most powerful thing we have in real estate. It's your authentic self. And when you own your story, you're showing up as your authentic self. And very similarly, when someone is looking at you online, you don't know what they're gonna connect with. I didn't know if you were divorced, but now we have a connection. And imagine if I was showing up to a listing appointment at your house, you already feel like you know me a little bit and you have a connection. And maybe it was the college drawing or maybe it was the children or maybe it was the, we don't know. But now I'm putting my story out there. I'm saying this is who I am as a person. And now it allows you to connect in your terms rather than me trying to force my terms on you. I don't know if that makes sense. It makes perfect sense. And also this idea of vulnerability is really the gateway to connection. And you are vulnerable on this. And I like that because so many people are desperate for connection. And but it's scary to get vulnerable. It's scary to put your story out there because of course, people can judge you for it or people can have a reaction that isn't what you want. But you were saying it's my story. This is what it is. And but people love that. I love it. I love the anyway. So we'll move on. Because I could talk about that all day. I think that is such a great example of who you are is the willingness to put something like that out there I think is a really great indicator of your character and also where you're at in life. But let's start all the way at the beginning of your story because I really want to hear about how you got to where you are now. So how did you get started in real estate? So I was a teacher. So I graduated from Syracuse University. I knew from a very early age I wanted to be a teacher. I loved it. And I was inspired by some of my teachers like most teachers are. And I graduated in 2000 when my master's degree and I became a high school history teacher. And unfortunately, I realized very quickly I was poor. So as a teacher. So I needed a side business. And most teachers have a little side thing. They paint their movers or they coach or whatever it might be. And I had a conversation with a teacher who was just about to retire and he said, if I could go back and do it all over again, I would get my real estate license and sell real estate part time and then teach full time. You get the best of both worlds. So I was like, sure. So I went online, Googled real estate schools, found the closest one. And I literally got my license in. It was one of those like all weekend classes. So I got it four weekends, got my license, and I was a REALTOR. And I started selling and I always intended it in the beginning to be a part time thing. Like I thought it was just gonna be something I sell for five homes a year, make a little extra money and be a teacher the rest of my life. And I'm also a former college athlete. So I'm a little competitive. So I got into it and actually loved it. Because I think it reminded me of sports, right? Like if you work hard, you actually get a return here, right? And there was a piece of my soul so to speak that missed that competition, right? You every day of your life as a college athlete, you're competing and then you leave it. You're like, okay, that's over. And now I was back in a competition mode. And I just, I loved it. I'd gravitated into it up. I was successful and I literally did both for three years as a part time agent because of the fact that I grew up, you grew up craving stability. Like I did five years, they're a key university in my opinion, the best school out there, you know? But at the end of the day, like you go to school for five years, become a teacher and you achieve it. And I'm gonna leave it to go sell houses at a hundred percent commission. And it was probably probably difficult in a sense too because I imagine with teaching, sometimes there's a calling, like it's like I feel drawn to do this. You obviously could have chosen any career, Syracuse is a great university. And so you could have chosen any path and did you feel called to teach? Was that like part of? Totally. And the last year I stayed, the last year I literally stayed because of the fact I didn't wanna leave the senior class so that was teaching because I've done with them all four years. And it's a relationship. It's a relationship. It's a relationship. And care about those kids, sure. Exactly. And then on the surface, when you look at real estate on the surface, it actually, it feels very, especially nowadays with like all the housewives and the HTTB stuff, right? It feels very like. And what I've discovered though within real estate is all the skills I applied as a teacher, I can apply in real estate. And that's what made me successful between caring about someone, learning about who they are, making sure I could explain everything properly, making sure they really, really understood the process, right? All the skills of a teacher applied so closely to me being a REALTOR, as long as they then applied sort of that confidence and the sort of the drive you have as an athlete as well, when those came together, it really made me who I was. So I did both for three years and then finally in 2005, when full-time real estate. And it was maybe the decision that, you know, that this was gonna be my career. And then now you're in, you're a corporate guy now. Now you're part of a, you're part of the biggest real estate company out there right now. So you are the national head of agent development at Compass and everybody knows Compass, of course. I would hope by now everyone knows Compass. And you know, they just, they just are crushing it everywhere. And obviously Robert Reffkin's a really impressive guy, of course, and you guys are always in the news and always a lot going on with Compass. How did you get to Compass? Just out of curiosity. Yeah. So over the course of my career, you know, I was an individual agent in 2005 and over in 2012, I created my real estate team. And it was called Real Estate with Heart, you know, all about caring and caring about people, et cetera. That team, I grew that team into one of the top teams in the Philadelphia market at the time. I was with Keller Williams, which I love Keller Williams. It's such a great company, some great trainings and awesome culture, et cetera. But I was at the time, I was also craving a little something more, shall we say. And Compass at that time in 2018 was just starting to launch in the Philadelphia market. So I remember taking my first recruiting appointment only, I was taking it because I was like, I'm gonna learn about this company so I can recruit against them. And a minute when I walked in, you're like, wait a minute, they've got everything. I don't want to compete with those guys. It was that situation. I walked into the appointment. I met a gentleman named Rob Lehman. And at the end of the day in my head, I'm like, oh my God, why did I take this appointment? Because I literally fell in love with the company, the philosophy, the branding, the marketing, there are so many aspects that I wanted to create, but there was just so many, it's so challenging in most real estate companies to create it because of the fact that, you know, the factors present really hold you back. And Compass sort of overcame this really because of the fact that they invested so many millions of dollars in supporting agents first. And that was like this philosophy that I had that I really wanted to sort of pursue. So at the time in 2018, I came over to Compass. I took over as the managing director for the city of Philadelphia. And my team came over as well. My sister ran my team. And yeah, we launched in June of 2018 that I came over in August of 2018. And it was an awesome ride. And then over the years, the teacher and me started to come out. And really, this is accentuated in the pandemic. So I'd been doing a little bit of national teaching that are retreats and things along those lines in the pandemic hits, right? So March of 2020, hard to remember it, but everything shut down. And we're sitting there like, what do we do? And immediately myself and a group of probably about 13 or 14 other people were formed and we launched a thing called Coaching at Compass, which was all virtual training. So every single day, all we did was we did all of this virtual training. The other thing was I was drinking a lot, eating a lot, watching Netflix a lot, we would have our virtual happy hour. And then you're like, all right, six o'clock, what do I do now? My little just watched TV, there's nothing to do. And this was in March. So the end of April, I launched a group called the Six Amers, which was sort of a morning and accountability group, just within my market, just within the field of your market. So between the Coaching at Compass and the Six Amers, I started to work a little more nationally, but I was still managing full time as well. And then at the beginning of this year, I was promoted to the head of agent development here at Compass to make a long story short. No, it's really impressive. You've really come full circle, you're teaching again. And also, you're obviously super engaged in the real estate industry and market. So before we, I want to get some advice because our audience are all REALTORS, I assume. I don't know who else would want to listen to our show, but we love our audience, of course. But we also are here to help educate them and help get them ready. And for next year, we have a shifting market that's already shifted and we just had a fed rate increase a couple days ago. So we're certainly agents are, well, you know, they're stressed, they're worried. And I'm super excited to learn, you know, what you're telling agents on what to do through the end of the year, all the way into 2023. But before we do, let's get to your podcast because I always wait till the very end to sort of say, oh, and by the way, he's got this. And then, you know, not as many people make it to the end. So I want to make sure we get that out there right now. So tell us about the Six Amers. Yeah, so the Six Amers, once again, it was formed in April of 2020. And the mindset, it actually was the originally, like a couple of years prior, I'd gotten divorced. And one of my really good friends, a guy named Jake Dreyfus at Keller Williams, I was struggling, I was in a bad place. Sure. You can see this on the left. I've been there, I know. Yeah, it's bad. It's even in the best of scenarios, it's bad. Yes. And I've a beautiful divorce, by the way, I have a great relationship. It's like, you know, my kids are, we have great beautiful 50, 50 custody, et cetera. But going through it, it rocks you. So Jake would, he said, hey, I'm going to start texting you early in the morning. 5am, we followed a guy named Jocco Willenick, who's like, sure, sure. Yeah, of course. So by the way, for anyone who doesn't know who Jocco Willenick is, he's got a million books. He's a crazy, what X Navy seal or. Maybe he's a little bit. Yeah, I guess you're never an X Navy seal, I shouldn't say. It's like disrespectful. I didn't mean it to be, he's not. But anyway, he's an X Navy seal and this guy is hardcore. And he's all about discipline. And anyway, go correct it, I'm sorry. So Jake and I formed a group called the 5 Ambers, right? We woke up the 5. Couple days a week, we'd get on a Zoom call. We actually launched it like nationwide. It was really cool. Actually, the Facebook group still exists today. Jake's one of my best friends today. But you know, he moved to Colorado. I went to Compass, like, you know, so we, it's just sort of sort of settled in, I guess we could say. So in the pandemic, I sort of just revived it as the 6 Ambers. A, it was a pandemic, so you didn't need to get up at 5 Am. And 6 Am is also that hour that really allows it to be accessible to everyone. Yeah, 5 Am is a little tough. Yeah, it's a little hard. If you're not like a crew guy, a swimmer, like an early morning person, a paperboy, right? Right, 5 Am is just, it's not healthy as well. 6 Am was a great time. And to make a long story short, what we do is, Tuesdays and every month you sign up and you commit to doing one goal for the month, you wake up at 6 Am, and you get on a Zoom call on Tuesdays and Thursdays. And I usually will interview someone motivational on the Zoom call. And then I'll put a post, I'll post a question of the day on Monday, Wednesday and Friday and the workplace, which is our internal Facebook system that you need to answer. And then we also read one book of the month. And the goal is, let's create a community around sort of waking up early and really taking care of ourselves. Because at the end of the day is REALTORS. What do we do all day, every day? What makes it successful is we take care of other people. And that's good during the day because of the fact that's what makes you successful. The challenge we have as REALTORS is that usually that spills over into the early morning and in the late evening because of the fact that we are always on email and texts and social media. And we literally wake up, for the moment we wake up, it's the moment we go to bed, sometimes we're on our devices. So the goal of the six Amers is really the state of people that you don't need to be all things to all people at all times early in the morning. Early in the morning is your problem. That's for you. And we coin to term, we call healthy selfish, that you need to be selfish in a healthy way early in the morning. You don't get on the phone. And everyone is different, right? For some people it's working out, for some it's meditating, for some it's reading, for some people it's folding laundry because it makes you feel like you're in control. Whatever it is that you need to do for yourself, that's selfish, but it's healthy selfish. That's really what we try to preach. And we want people to wake up with a little bit of motivation, a little bit of positivity, a little bit of inspiration early in the morning to carry them throughout the day. Now, is this open to only Compass agents or can anyone apply for this? It's a great question. So it is right, the live group is only Compass agents, right? Because of the fact we use internal communication systems, et cetera. And over the years, I had hours and hours of interviews that I recorded. And my mom, my mom, can you send me that interview or like, you know, people would say, hey, can you send me the interview? I want to send it to my kids and it really, it got to the point where I was like, I've got to put this out publicly because there are so many great inspirational moments and interviews and a lot of there's people within Compass but people outside of Compass as well that we interview. So I was really motivated to put something out there that the world could actually see inside what we do as a group and gain inspiration from it as well. And I'll say it's obviously, it's a lot of REALTOR as well we have a lot of staff members in there and the podcast really is not about REALTOR per se. It's really about you as an individual and a person and how do you get inspired and really take care of yourself. So podcasts can be listened to by anyone. So we'll have a link to that in the show notes, again, called 6am or number six. And if you want to be part of the actual accountability group, that's limited to for currently to the Compass agent. So a lot of our listeners are Compass agents. So if you don't know about this, this is a great time to sign up. But let's talk about right now what's going on because of course everyone's focused on what's right in front of them which is some challenging times, right? We had, well, they're challenging times in relation to what we had a couple of years ago. And I think that's an obvious thing for people to think back and go well, that was easy, this is hard. But if we think back maybe a couple of years ago, even at 3% interest rates, I don't know that it was so easy. I think if you were working with buyers, we all remember it was not easy. If you were working with sellers, you had a great run. But now things have changed and we're now, rates are of course are much higher. Obviously business still needs to continue, people still need to move. And but yet I'm part of our local association here. And I work on some committees that deal with programming around helping agents get through this current time. And boy, everybody I know is a little bit stressed. So as you know, so I'm curious on what you're telling agents or what you're seeing out there, how are successful agents sort of continuing to stay focused? Are they putting the blinders on and just kind of doing the things they were always doing or are they are people pivoting? Just curious to get your thoughts on what you're seeing. Well, the first thing I'll give everyone is that the solution to anxiety is action. But if you right now are feeling anxious, anxiety is all about unknown things in the future. And what happens when we feel anxiety is we get, we sort of get frozen in place, almost picture the deer in the headlights, right? And we don't move. And that is not a good thing right now. So if you're out there and you're hearing this and you feel anxiety, my challenge to you is what are the actions that you need to take in order to move forward, right? Get out of the headlights, get out of the blind spot, get out of that frozen mode. Because the reality is there are real estate transactions that are rehabbed, there's millions of transactions that are gonna happen. But in this moment when you feel that frozen mode, that anxiety is gonna kick in and it's gonna paralyze you. And if you are not in a mode of action every single day, then you are literally going to sort of slide backwards and it's gonna get really, really hard. For successful agents and what I'm coaching everyone, this is an opportunity. We have a massive opportunity right now as professional agents to capture market share and elevate what we do. In two years ago, a year ago, let's be real. If the property was priced right and you had it in the MLS, like it probably would be. You had to do, yeah. So at the end of the day, our role as an agent or an I like calling us like advisors and consultants around real estate sales. At the end of the day, we weren't able to fulfill our greatest potential because of the fact that it was, the market was so crazy, it was so fueled with low interest rates and low inventory, it was hyper-grouch, right? It was not natural. And so now we're moving back to a world where there is an opportunity for us to elevate what we do as REALTORS and to elevate what we do with an industry to actually embrace that role as the advisor and the consultant. And I really am coaching agents right now to figure out everything you can do to be in action. And when you think about like the last two years, a lot of agents probably didn't work in their CRM. They didn't update their contacts, they didn't reach out. They didn't have those great touch points that made you successful, right? All you did was you did transactions, you showed properties, you listened to homes and you were so busy and so frenetic that you were just running so fast. Well, we have an opportunity now to take a step back and we're still gonna work as hard. We're just gonna work in a different manner because the reality is the millions of transactions that are gonna happen in this real estate industry are gonna happen to people that have real life situations. But if we are not in a relationship with these people, what are they gonna do? They're gonna click on a link online and then they're gonna get connected to someone that's paying lots of money to a third party company. And the reality is we need to be reaching out to people we know in a human manner, in a manner that develops our relationships. So when that advisory role comes up, we are elevated and they reach out to us for help, right? When you think about financial advisors, your financial advisor is constantly in touch with you hopefully about your portfolio and what you should be doing. And the reality of real estate transaction happens once every seven, eight, 10, 15 years. But- So there's a lot of lead time in between. And what most agents do is they don't remain in their clients' lives as an advisor around real estate beyond the transaction. And our- I can pause, can I pause for a second? I have a theory about this. Number one, obviously, so we're talking about the time in between sales, which I think is maybe, is not even maybe, it is more important than when you're actually working with the client. Because as you said, this is, I mean, we've all seen the stats, the, I don't know, depends on what study you look at. But the certain number of people, certain percentage of people literally forget who the REALTOR was like three years after the transaction. My parents are this way, it took them, they had a home in North Merdle Beach, and it took years to sell it, because it was just kind of weird timing, whatever. Anyway, it took years and many different REALTOR's to finally sell this property. Finally, somebody did it after like five years of this brutal, but they finally did it. And my parents were like, oh, thank God, somebody finally got it sold. And my parents are super grateful to this person. I was asking my dad not that long ago, this is a couple of years ago, but I said, who was making a REALTOR? Because I thought maybe I had a lead out there. I was just gonna say, he goes, I don't remember. And my parents like this person, and they couldn't remember. Now they don't live in North Merdle Beach, you know, they're never gonna do another transaction there, but still, that was shocking to me. And I went, oh yeah, I'm in the industry, of course, that makes sense. People don't stay in touch. And what you said, I think is really important. So here was my thing I was gonna suggest for anyone out there that's going, okay, like Sky was saying, now's the time to think about, how can I deepen my relationships with my connection to these people? Well, that sometimes is the challenge. They might go, I don't know what, am I supposed to just call once in a while? Or I don't, I know they're not. They just moved in a year ago. What am I gonna do? I could call them and say, like, what's going on? Or how you doing? And that's fine. But what I've always suggested, especially you talked about your CR, like really getting your CRM updated, I think now is the time to call everybody you know, especially now if you have some extra time and you probably do, call everybody in your database. And literally just update the information. Be like, hey, I'm working on my marketing thing for next year. I just wanna make sure I have all the right data for you. Find out their birthdays. Find out their anniversary if they're married. Find out, you know, where they work. If you don't know, you know, and this gives you, find out what their children names, ages, maybe even birthdays too for that. So this way, if you have that information, you now have six, seven reasons to pick up the phone next year already automatically built in to your calendar, right? You're like, have the ability to pick up the phone and go, hey, it's your wedding anniversary. Just wanted to say happy anniversary. Anyway, I was just thinking like, this is the time to get that data in there so that you have all those touch points built into your calendar. So true. Well, and I think to agent struggle with this, what do I say? And I think the reality is because of the fact that we're looking at that former client as a client, not a human being. And when you go back and let's bring it back to the beginning of our interview, right? Like my website, you look at it, you get an idea who I am as a human being. And I think this is a technique you can also, so use as you put a touch point to do what I call reverse social media. So social media, Instagram and Facebook, they give us what they want us to see. But we have the ability to go in and actually look at what's happening in our client's lives. And when you ask yourself the question, well, what should I say? Well, what's happening in their life? And reach out about it, right? Give them a compliment, give them a peace gratitude, or you can just say, and this is one of my favorite scripts, was you, it's a text or an email and you just say, hey, I'm just going through my records. I saw your name and it made me smile. Just want to say hi, no need to respond back. Just letting you know. Oh, boy. And again, we want to emphasize only do this if somebody's authentically makes you smile too. Because people are going to smell something that isn't honest. But you are so absolutely right, is using social media as almost research and development. You can literally just, again, don't wait for the feed because Facebook's only going to serve up things that they think you're going to want to see. You're not going to really get a good sense of everything that's going on in someone's life. So go through, type in their name, see what, see if they've been on vacation, lately see what's going on with their kids. And then my suggestion is, don't, you can always comment on posts and that's great and that's definitely better than doing nothing. My suggestion is pick up the phone and call or text, be like, hey, man, just saw you got back from Cancun, hope you had an amazing trip. Like, that's the sort of stuff that people go, wow. Yeah, the other brilliant gem I'm going to give you as well is ask for help. Yes. I'm coaching next week. I'm actually coaching this within Compass and we're going to basically be giving, we have thousands of agents signed up that's I'm really excited. But it's five days of giving is the challenge. So I'm going to be basically showing how gratitude but the first thing is agents are going to reach out to their clients to say, hey, we're developing a recipe book. Do you have any Thanksgiving recipes that you love that I could share in this recipe book? And everybody has at least one. And even if they don't, what they're going to say is, oh, I don't have anyone but that's awesome. Can you send me that when you're done? Absolutely. And now you have a digital recipe book that you can send out instead of just the corny, hey, hope you're having a Thanksgiving, the blast email blast we all get, right? Like the turkey. I'm thankful you're one of my clients or what if not? Now, like, and when we, if your parents got a Thanksgiving recipe book from their REALTOR, like as a, it's awesome, right? Now we got to get beyond the transaction. We got to think of like, what are my clients going to need? And the key aspect of asking for help is people like helping other people. And now, and you're not asking for help in a bad way, you're asking for help in a good way. Imagine a neighborhood guide. You ask your clients, hey, I'm building a neighborhood guide. Do you have a favorite restaurant in Chicago or in? Everybody has one. Whatever. Right? And now, what are you doing? You're interacting with your clients, your former clients in a human way. And what do you, and it's all about being present in their mind in a positive manner. Because while they may not buy or sell a house every 10 years, how many people do they know in those 10 years that are going to buy or sell? And what you want to do as an agent, you want to create raven fans that when you say, who is your REALTOR? My clients, they say, oh my God, Sky, you've got to call them. Like, here's his number. And let me text him right now. Because of the fact I'm present in their lives in a manner that is nothing to do necessarily with real estate, but everything to do with real estate, if that makes sense. Totally. Now, after interviewing hundreds of top REALTORS in the country on the show, do you know what CRM is used more than any other by our amazing guests? Well, you guessed it. It is follow up boss. So let's face it, following up is the key to taking your business to the next level. Follow up boss will help you drive more leads in less time with less effort. Don't take my word for it. Robert Slack, who runs the number one team in the US uses follow up boss. And he's built a one and a half billion dollar business in just six years. I am sure Jonathan is hot on their tail. But follow up boss integrates with over 250 different systems. So you can keep your current tools and lead sources also. They have seven day a week support. So you'll get the help that you need and get this follow up boss is so sure you're going to love their CRM that for a limited time, they're offering keeping it real listeners a 30 day free trial, which is twice as much time as they give everyone else. And oh yeah, no credit card required. That's how confident they are that you're going to keep using them. But only if you use this special link, which is visit followupboss.com forward slash real. That's follow up boss.com forward slash real for your free 30 day trial. Follow up like a boss with follow up boss. Boy, I'm just absorbing what you did. I realize what I need to do is create content from our listeners. I never have asked our listeners to contribute to the show. I asked the tele friend and boy, that is all you ever have to do if you're listening is tele friend. But I'm thinking you just gave me a great idea. I would love to create a list of tips from our listeners about what's working for them right now. And maybe what is it working? That would be kind of cool too. But putting that together and just giving that away to our audience and saying, hey, here's all the stuff that you guys told me. So that I love that boy, what a great, some great idea. Oh, I love that. So what do we think about 2023? Here's what we know we know rates are higher than they were. I don't want to say high. I just want to say higher than they were because my parents got their first mortgage. It was double digits in the late 70s. So again, it's all relative. But we know that people are not as happy with rates as they were. So how are we talking about this, not just rates? I just mean, how are we talking to clients right now? Or what are you suggesting agents do to really explain sort of or rather to sort of set the narrative versus what maybe the media is projecting? Correct. Well, hey, the media is always going to put things out there that are going to generate activity, right? The reality is that real estate transactions based around most real estate, transactions around life goals, not financial goals. Some true. Yeah, we're not talking about investment properties and all that stuff like that's a little different. But for the vast majority of people that buy or sell real estate, they're doing it not because of finances, but they're doing it because of life, that divorce, birth, job. New job. Right? So the reality is that most people real estate to one thing you need, that's an excessive life that's also an asset that you need to buy and sell, right? Air, water, like you know, not really buying and selling that. It's just like sort of natural shelter is an necessity of life. So one of the key things that I challenge are the real tears that are listening, this is find the people that have those life events that do have that need and with them work with them on solutions. So an entrepreneurial principle we talk about here, Compass is be solutions driven. When you are encountering a problem within your client's life or your transactions, etc. The more you focus on the problem, the less you can accomplish. The more you focus on potential solutions and the pros and cons of each, well now you can actually move into action. So the bottom line is there's usually a solution to something and at the end of the day, that's what we need to drive at. There's two one buy downsers, seller held financing. There's lots of potential solutions, but what are they? Now the one thing, when I think about 2023, I went through 2008, I think you might have as well. Like, I got in just after that, but I've had enough guests on the show that have been through it, so I feel like I've been through it. Yeah, and that was different because there was a nuclear bomb that went off underneath our feet. This is different because what we're doing here is we're just pumping the brakes on the growth that was not healthy. It was not healthy to have double digit growth, multiple bids, that was not a good thing. So what I'm trying to coach REALTORS on and also in essence, your buyers and sellers, is that you gotta go back into the life goals of what you're trying to do and then backfill into the finances. Start with life, then go finances, rather than being like, oh, I just watched that thing on box news or CNN and I'm scared. Well, that's not how you should make a decision. The second thing is that get ready for the bounce, meaning this is a little bit of a correction into normalcy. And at some point, as rates start to go down, the demand is still there. We haven't gotten rid of the demand for housing, right? We haven't gotten, and the inventory is still at all time low, frankly. Even as we're starting to increase, we're still at an all time low for most markets. So the reality is there is probably a little bit of a bounce coming. We just don't know exactly where that's gonna be. And once again, the work you do in the next six months will probably dictate the next two years of your real estate career. Because if you sit there and once again, that anxiety kicks in and you just start your hands and say, well, I'm just gonna sit here and go on Facebook and Instagram and give up. Well, that's gonna dictate the next two years of your real estate career. You're gonna live pretty slim. Most REALTORS that I'm working with right now are so excited because of the fact that they actually have time now to help class. They have time to work in their serum. They have time to take those actions, build the Thanksgiving recipe book, frankly. You can do the fun stuff now. Now's the fun stuff time. Exactly. And the reality is like, yes, it's just about getting better as a professional and improving your craft. And as you do that, you're going to do more transactions. And you're frankly gonna gain a lot of market share. Most good agents are actually like, oh, here's an opportunity. All those like, if you do research in your local market, look up, how over the last 20 months, how many deals were, how many agents did one, two, or three deals in the last 20 months? The realities, those agents are gonna be gone in the next six months. There you go. We're already, we have a holding company here at art. We have two companies, ones for active producing agents. And ones we just created for, not every state has these, but for people that don't actively produce, but want to keep their license active. They just want to hang in. We in the last, so we have about 700 agents in that company in the holding company. In the last, or maybe 800 now, in the last month, we've added almost 50 agents just because people are exiting the business. So if you are a producing agent, whether you're part time or full time, now's the time to really get excited because lots of people are leaving. That's right. And I think too, we'll see this accelerate as dues come for like most associations operating on a yearly schedule. So you'll see that jump in January, probably as well. So it's key. And once again, I think it's a positive is like there are really solid economics. People have equity. People, you know, you remember, like, I know you just got in, I mean, you probably remember doing short sales, right? Sure. People didn't have equity. And banks were foreclosing. Like we have a lot of positive economic aspects that are going on right now that are good. And if you're buying a home, the real, this is a really great way you can explain to buyers. Here are three options. There are three things that are going to happen with interest rates if you buy today. Number one, interest rates are going to go up and you're going to be really happy that you locked in the 7% or 6% or whatever it is you locked in. Number two, they're going to stay the same and then you're nowhere soft. Or number three, they're going to go down and then you're going to refinance into that lower rate. So the reality is in either one of these scenarios you're going to end up in a good space as long as that's a really great way that you can explain to buyers right now, the fact that interest rates going up, it's just sort of the reality of where we are as in the interest rate market. The reality of interest rates are going to change and if they go up and you locked in, I remember I just bought a house actually in June and I was so pissed and I was like, man, I could have locked in. You missed out. I missed it and now I'm like, oh my mind says like, so it changed. I was like, oh, thank God I locked in then at the 4.25 rate I got. I was at the time I was so mad. Now I'm thrilled, but the reality is no matter where you are, you can explain. One of three things is going to happen. They're going to go up and you're going to be happy. They're going to stay the same. You're going to be happy. They're going to go down and you've got to pay a little money to refinance into the lower rate. Yeah, and you brought up something a few minutes ago that I just want to step on a little bit because it's so important, which is that you said most consumers, most buyers and sellers aren't thinking about rates. They are thinking about their life events and funny enough, I just got lucky when I bought my most recent condo, which just happened to fall in a time when the rates were that low. That was not the reason I bought. It was because this new development came about and I was like, I needed to make a move and it just so happened that I got lucky with rates. It could have been that it was 7%, either way I needed to move. And so I just got lucky. So I think as agents, we often were so immersed in it that it's so much of our life that we think everyone else is thinking about it, but you're right. In most cases, people are thinking about what they need for their family and whatever the rate is is the rate and it'll affect what they can afford of course, but it's not going to, I don't think it's pushing people away as much as agents might be talking about it right now. Like agents are thinking people are scared and they don't want to pay. And I'm like, I don't know how true that is for the vast majority of buyers and sellers. And then you'll feel this about a little bit too because right now we probably still have the people that we're looking at in the three and four percent rate and for those who didn't get in. Yeah. It is real for them, but the people that you will encounter over the next six months when they meet you and you do your consultation, you explain here's a process, here's the payment, here's where rates are. For them, that's just where rates are, right? And one more thing I was just gonna, before I'm sorry, but also too, the people who did buy a couple years ago, the last couple of years, probably overpaid by a significant, so that's another thing you can bring up if somebody's like, well, rates are where they're at. Say like, well, let me just show you what it would have cost back then to purchase this home. And then all of the sudden things get more in line. Like, oh, okay, it's not a sky's falling. Sorry, I'm so glad. No, no, I was gonna almost say the exact same thing and the other positives are we can actually do a home inspection. We can actually get an appraisal. You don't have to buy a site on the same. I bought my home with no, I didn't see it. I just went off the picture. That's amazing. I didn't do an inspection. I didn't have a mortgage contingency, even though I got a mortgage, so no appraisal contingency, right? And, but I knew what I was doing. I'm gonna prefer to see it. Because I'm gonna look at it, knew what I was basically buying. But still, that's scary. Very, I'm in the business. I was really scared about it, but at the end of the day, that's what buyers had to do to get a home. The positive now is actually, I, as a real estate professional, can protect you. I can actually do an inspection for you. We can do appraisal. We can have a mortgage contingency. Hey, you need to sell your home and buy this one, we can actually make a contingent now because of the fact we're back. What we're doing, we're just coming back to the ground. This is like, we were, we just, it was a rocket that took off. And now we're just sort of settling back into the ground of what's normal in real estate. It's normal for ours to take 60 days to sell. It's not normal for it to sell in two or three days back. In, you know, 2010, you saw the house in two days, you're like, woo, that's great. You know, no, it's like, it's normal for this to take some time. And that's what we have to adopt this mindset that we are professionals. And what we do matters, if what we do doesn't matter, then the internet companies are just going to take it over and do it for us at a cheaper rate, frankly, right? Yeah, and they're going to do a better job digitally than we can do because that's their business. What we can do is all the interpersonal stuff. All the we care about you stuff. And if you can be the care about you person and the I can educate you and reassess what's actually going on and re-educate you and make you feel cared for and appreciate it as a human being, then that's going to win out almost every time over the tech. That being said, I think this is actually perfect place to wrap up. So I want a couple of things. The six AMers, if you are a Compass agent and you want to participate in the accountability group, what's the best way that they should do? I guess they probably know internally, they probably know how to get access. I hope so, but just in case you don't, you could obviously email me sky at Compass.com or you could actually sign up on the website as a Compass agent as well. And if you are not a Compass agent, which of course most people listening are not, let's listen to the podcast, subscribe to six AMers and get a, still you still get all the interviews and all the exciting parts of what sky does. And by the way, if you are an agent and you are not happy at your current firm or just want to see what else is out there, obviously Compass would love the opportunity to speak with you. There's reach out to your local Compass office, you can reach out to sky as well. I'm sure you're heading directly to the right person, but Compass is really doing some great things. And I don't work for Compass and I'm impressed with Compass because I just think they do so many, so many wonderful things for agents. So definitely if you're looking to explore their options, except if you're one of our agents, stay with us. But I'm only being silly, of course. But anyway, if you are exploring other options, check out Compass, they are actually a bit different than a lot of what the traditional big firms offer. So check them out, they do a lot of great things. So sky, thank you so much for being on the show. This was a real pleasure and a lot of fun for me. And I won't become a Compass agent only because I have my feet are firmly planted here. But I wish I was only to be part of your 6 AM group. So maybe I'll figure out a way to sneak under the door because I need that accountability in my mind. So if anyone out there is a Compass agent, definitely let's sign up for 6 AMers. It's so many people read the Howl Red Book of the Miracle Morning, which is like every REALTOR I know has read that book. This is an extension of that and specific to real estate. So anyway, guys, thanks. On behalf of Sky and myself, we want to thank everyone for listening and supporting our show. As I said earlier, please tell a friend, that's the only thing that you need to do to help us continue to grow. And also check out Sky Michaels.
