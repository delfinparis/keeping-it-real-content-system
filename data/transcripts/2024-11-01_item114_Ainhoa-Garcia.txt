[00:01:22] Are you looking for agents to join your brokerage, your team?
[00:01:26] Now, as a real estate recruiter, I can tell you the answer is always yes.
[00:01:31] But most agents aren't looking to move right now.
[00:01:33] So how do you know who to contact?
[00:01:36] Well, what if I were to tell you there's a recruiting and retention tool powered by artificial intelligence
[00:01:40] that shows you exactly which agents in your local market are looking to leave their brokerage right now
[00:01:46] and which agents at your own firm are also looking to leave you?

[00:02:09] Not only does it do that, but corded AI went and visited my recruiting website
[00:02:13] and read everything I offer.

[00:02:20] based on that agent's needs and what my brokerage can offer.
[00:02:23] It even writes emails for me.

[00:03:11] Before we get to Anoa, just a couple of quick reminders.
[00:03:15] As always, the best way that you can help us is by telling a friend, think of another REALTOR that could benefit from hearing from top 1% agents like Anoa and send them a link over to this episode.

[00:03:43] All right, let's get right to it.
[00:03:45] My conversation with Anoa Garcia.
[00:04:00] My guest today is a friend of mine and somebody I am super excited to have on the show.
[00:04:08] Somebody I deeply admire.
[00:04:10] Her name is Anoa Garcia.
[00:04:11] She is a top 1% REALTOR here in Chicago.
[00:04:15] Let me tell you more about Anoa.
[00:04:18] Anoa Garcia is a Chicago real estate professional that graduated from the University of Cordoba in Spain and the University of Paul Verlain in France in translation and interpreted interpreting studies.
[00:04:31] And she moved to Chicago from Spain in 2012, discovered her passion for helping others through real estate, combining it with her love of design, business and communication.
[00:04:41] In 2023, Anoa served as the elected president of Naurip Chicago and is also a co-author of a best-selling book called Latinas in real estate.
[00:04:52] Anoa is committed to making every real estate transaction memorable for her clients and leads a top producing team.
[00:04:59] Outside of work, she travels, she cooks, she volunteers, she serves, and she is an all around just powerhouse of a person.
[00:05:10] And I've known her for many years and I'm super excited to have her.
[00:05:14] Please welcome Anoa Garcia to the show. Anoa, good to see you.
[00:05:18] Hi!
[00:05:22] First of all, you and I both have Spanish names.
[00:05:27] My name is Delphin and yours is Anoa and there is no real for Delphin.
[00:05:35] There is no English equivalent.
[00:05:38] Is there an English equivalent for Anoa in American?
[00:05:44] No, not at all.
[00:05:46] Not even. I mean, the sound you can say, I know a REALTOR.
[00:05:52] I know.
[00:05:53] You can play with the phonetics. That's about it.
[00:05:57] Oh, that is really funny.
[00:05:58] You have a great, really cool name, but more importantly, is what's, obviously beneath the name,
[00:06:07] which is all of your hard work and discipline, and your service.
[00:06:11] By the way, I want everybody to check out Anoa and her partner Nancy, her teammate, on their website.
[00:06:18] Anoa Garcia, hyphenco.com.
[00:06:20] There will be a link to that in the show notes.
[00:06:22] By the way, amazing website really showcases you and Nancy in a way that I think is very fresh
[00:06:30] and really highlights your personality.
[00:06:32] I think it's a well-done example for other REALTORS to follow.
[00:06:37] So Anoa Garcia, hyphenco.com.
[00:06:40] Again, link to that in the show notes.
[00:06:41] And I want you to follow Anoa on Instagram.
[00:06:45] You, I know what is your Instagram account.
[00:06:48] It's I know a REALTOR, A-I-N-A-T-O-A REALTOR.
[00:06:53] That's my annual.
[00:06:55] And we will have a link to that in the show notes.
[00:06:58] So I met Anoa many years ago.
[00:07:00] We served on a committee together at the local level here in Chicago, Illinois,
[00:07:06] at the Chicago Association of REALTORS.
[00:07:08] And I was very drawn to Anoa because she was one of the people on the committee that was very
[00:07:18] very serious about helping other REALTORS.
[00:07:22] She was very engaged and she really was quite generous with her time.
[00:07:31] And she's generous with her time again today, being on our show.
[00:07:33] So let's start all the way at the beginning.
[00:07:35] How did you not, how did you get to America?
[00:07:38] Because of course you took a plane and you got here.
[00:07:41] That's right.
[00:07:42] Why did you come here in 2012?
[00:07:45] Well, thank you so much for the invite and all your kind words.
[00:07:50] I really, really appreciate the opportunity to share with you and your audience.
[00:07:55] Thank you for having this platform and highlighting me today.
[00:07:59] So my story in America is sourced in 2012, as you said.
[00:08:04] And it was pretty random.
[00:08:07] I have made a few random decisions in my life that kind of build
[00:08:11] to these path into something else later.
[00:08:15] But I just saw an ad.
[00:08:16] I was in university at the lunch room.
[00:08:19] We had a micro-in-area for those who didn't have money to pay for lunch at the cafeteria.
[00:08:25] I brought my little container and I saw an ad that said,
[00:08:29] if you come and appear and leave the American dream.
[00:08:32] And I was finishing up university and the economic crisis was pretty heavily affecting
[00:08:39] Europe, Spain, Portugal, Greece in particular.
[00:08:44] And I was like, I'm going to finish university.
[00:08:46] I just had to come back from France.
[00:08:50] And I'm like, what am I going to do?
[00:08:51] I cannot go back home.
[00:08:52] I left when I was 16 years old.
[00:08:54] So I'm like, I cannot go back home.
[00:08:56] I need to find a solution.
[00:08:58] I need to find a job and recently graduated.
[00:09:01] Nobody was going to hire me at my space when I was at in Spain.
[00:09:06] So I called that phone number that I saw in the ad and I became an opair,
[00:09:12] which if you don't know is a leaving money.
[00:09:16] So I came and lived here with a wonderful family in all town.
[00:09:21] And after the first year, I extended for another year because I realized that Chicago was so much more.
[00:09:29] The America was so much bigger.
[00:09:32] And the economic crisis was still bad.
[00:09:34] So it's like, I'm not going to go back just yet.
[00:09:37] I need to improve in my English.
[00:09:39] And I need to be surrounded by English speaking people 24-7.
[00:09:45] So I can get better at that.
[00:09:46] And I decided to stay another year.
[00:09:48] And that's when everything changed.
[00:09:51] I met a lot more friends.
[00:09:53] I started to do fun things, not necessarily just working.
[00:09:58] My English got a lot better, so that opened other doors.
[00:10:02] And I became a nanny for a family in Roscoe Village.
[00:10:08] Wonderful, wonderful family.
[00:10:11] And I was no longer living nanny.
[00:10:13] Now I could do other things because I had an apartment.
[00:10:16] And I live with the family.
[00:10:18] So I could do other fun things that need more people.
[00:10:22] And my dream just got bigger and bigger and bigger over time.
[00:10:26] And actually, it's because of the father of the second family.
[00:10:31] That I'm in real estate.
[00:10:32] He told me to look, because I told him, it's about time.
[00:10:39] You know, I've been being here with you guys for five years.
[00:10:42] I love you, but I came to America with bigger dreams.
[00:10:47] I wanted that American dream.
[00:10:49] And being a nanny, even though I had no worries.
[00:10:52] And he was a well-payed job.
[00:10:54] I wanted more out of life.
[00:10:56] So I said, I'm going to be thinking of leaving.
[00:10:59] And he said, why don't you do sales?
[00:11:01] Why don't you do real estate?
[00:11:04] And at that time, I didn't even know where real estate was.
[00:11:07] And I had to kind of like Google it.
[00:11:09] So yeah, that's kind of how things got to get started in real estate here.
[00:11:16] You know, it's amazing.
[00:11:17] It's something that for those of us born in this country,
[00:11:21] we often forget that people come to America for all sorts of different reasons.
[00:11:26] And highly educated people like yourself,
[00:11:30] who found an opportunity here to do something.
[00:11:34] And then, you know, you're being here allows you
[00:11:38] at the possibility to build this business that you really wanted to build.
[00:11:43] So was it difficult or how difficult was it being somebody who's not a native, you know,
[00:11:51] American to, you know, look, you know, Chicago is where I know
[00:11:58] and I both reside.
[00:11:59] But there's not a huge population of Spanish people in Chicago.
[00:12:04] There's a lot of people from Latin America, of course, in Mexico.
[00:12:08] But there's not a lot of Spanish.
[00:12:10] So curious on how did you start to integrate with the culture?
[00:12:16] How did you find clients?
[00:12:19] You know, what was that process like?
[00:12:22] So I'm very glad that you said that you correct to yourself.
[00:12:26] But you said, was it difficult or how difficult?
[00:12:29] There was nothing easy about this journey.
[00:12:33] But the reward of something bigger, the vision was so much larger
[00:12:40] that I never gave up that dream.
[00:12:44] So starting, let's say that first of all, I did not speak the language.
[00:12:50] I couldn't understand when people would talk to me.
[00:12:54] I knew how to write in English, but I did not know how to speak
[00:12:58] or understand what people would talk to me.
[00:13:02] But I made it a goal.
[00:13:04] I made it a goal to learn as fast as possible.
[00:13:07] I am a linguistic person.
[00:13:09] So it didn't take me as long as I know other people.
[00:13:12] I have, but I just made it a goal.
[00:13:17] I was like, okay, you're going to listen to every podcast.
[00:13:20] You're going to talk to everybody.
[00:13:21] It doesn't matter if you have an accent or not.
[00:13:23] You're just going to get yourself in this uncomfortable
[00:13:27] situations where you need to figure it out yourself.
[00:13:32] So the language was one of the challenges
[00:13:35] that I got to surpass or accomplish.
[00:13:40] Immigration and status as an immigrant is a whole nother at home.
[00:13:48] Because obviously without a legal status, you cannot be in this country.
[00:13:52] So I have my own set of struggles with that part.
[00:13:56] I was in this country for a long time, almost four years without being able to see
[00:14:01] my mom, my dad, my dad, everybody that I knew home.
[00:14:06] I couldn't leave the country.
[00:14:07] If I left, I wouldn't be able to come back because my process was,
[00:14:11] or my case was in process.
[00:14:13] So that alone made very difficult years of learning, of making money, of having,
[00:14:21] you know, working 128 hours a week.
[00:14:24] That's from 530 to 1130 Monday through Sunday.
[00:14:29] No days off for three years straight.
[00:14:32] So that's a lot that's a lot to take, but I was very young and it was
[00:14:36] eager to do and learn and so immigration was another challenge.
[00:14:41] So the language, immigration, and then as I started taking the first steps into real estate,
[00:14:48] I realized that I didn't have that as fear of influence.
[00:14:51] Because when you are a REALTOR, especially a new REALTOR,
[00:14:54] your first clients are going to be people that already know you, they trust you.
[00:14:59] Your friends?
[00:15:00] Yeah, your friends.
[00:15:01] It's going to be, you know, your mom's neighbor, your friend from college,
[00:15:07] your, these person, these other persons.
[00:15:09] So I did not have that.
[00:15:12] What I had was desire of learning, love for people.
[00:15:18] So I needed to find ideas and ways to be in front of more people that over time,
[00:15:24] they will learn to like me, trust me, and buy anything I would sell.
[00:15:29] So that's how I got everything to make sense.
[00:15:36] Once the language was not a problem, once the immigration was in process and I went through,
[00:15:42] I just picked hobbies.
[00:15:44] I picked a whole lot of different hobbies starting with soccer because that's something that I loved
[00:15:50] back home and that I play in co-ed teams.
[00:15:54] So I decided to join a team here and that was a way of meeting people.
[00:15:58] Still today, I keep in touch and I sell my first homes.
[00:16:01] It was to people from my soccer sphere.
[00:16:05] My, my boss, he as a hockey player and he sold 20 homes over the course of his, you know,
[00:16:14] five or six years when he was practicing to all the guys on his hockey team.
[00:16:19] And so it is funny that these passions, it's a great way to expand your sphere and also,
[00:16:26] do something fun for yourself but a lot of times business comes from it.
[00:16:31] It does and it's not a cushy way, it's not a, you're not selling really anything,
[00:16:38] you're getting to know people, people are getting to know you who you are as a person and then it
[00:16:41] happens. Oh, that you sell real estate. Actually, I need to, I want to buy, I want to sell.
[00:16:47] I know somebody that, and that's how things started and he was very, very organic and that's kind
[00:16:53] of how the family, probably my family of clients has grown throughout the years.
[00:16:58] Now you call them your family of clients. That is very intentional. Tell me why you say that.
[00:17:04] I do not have any family here in America. So any person that I would connect with, they would
[00:17:13] become at some point, I mean, if the person is very genuine, I've met all kind of people just
[00:17:19] like everybody does, right? Before the most part, the people that I connected the most,
[00:17:24] they were very genuine and they, when you become a close friend of someone or somebody that you see
[00:17:30] often or somebody that you just like, even if you don't see them often, like you and I don't see
[00:17:36] each other often, but we, I always have like a, you know, a great thought and feeling about,
[00:17:44] you know, if your name comes along or I'm like, oh, yeah, DJs, it's a feeling. So that's kind of how
[00:17:51] I started creating these, these family feeling is because they were my support system of times
[00:17:58] and I consumed myself with work because I didn't have family to hang out with. So I hang out with
[00:18:04] my clients and I went to their birthdays and to their housewarming and to anything that was family
[00:18:11] sure. You know, it's, I'm touching on the subject because I think it's a great opportunity for
[00:18:19] our listeners to think about is, you know, Anoa said, hey, I have a family of clients, it's not a
[00:18:25] marketing piece that she's trying to do. She's, she's not, she really truly thinks of her clients,
[00:18:32] some of her clients in that fashion and she celebrates family events with her clients.
[00:18:39] And I think, you know, that that's what family does. That's exactly what I'm here in
[00:18:45] Puriya for a funeral because that's what my friends are my family as well. And, and so, you know,
[00:18:52] that's what you do. And that is a remarkable really, you immersed yourself into, into Chicago,
[00:19:02] into our, you know, this culture where you knew nobody and you really started. So we know you got
[00:19:09] into hobbies, but you also really started serving and volunteering. And I can't imagine
[00:19:16] you have so many, there were so many difficulties in your path anyway, the language, no sphere of
[00:19:24] influence, no support system here. And oh, by the way, I'm going to donate some of my time and
[00:19:30] energy that probably I don't have to, to give back to the community. So can you tell us a little
[00:19:37] bit about why you started volunteering because as early as you did?
[00:19:45] Actually, it was even earlier than that. I haven't sure that with you before, but the moment I landed
[00:19:51] in America without knowing the language or anything, I knew that I wanted to feel needed.
[00:19:59] It's a, it's a feeling that I've always wanted to have. If you think I wanted to be a doctor
[00:20:05] because you're going to save lives or somebody's going to need you so much, almost like a mother
[00:20:11] feels. So with my first job, I had a little time off and I wanted to fill it up with something else
[00:20:20] that would make me feel needed. And it started with Casa Advocates, which is Casa of Cucone,
[00:20:27] core to point to the special advocates. And I was with the same case for five and a half years.
[00:20:35] So if somebody doesn't know Casa, it's for children in foster care. I was technically a big sister.
[00:20:44] I would do monthly visits and all those things. And I would go to court and percent
[00:20:51] I report to the judge so they could make a decision on their placement. So I absolutely, absolutely
[00:20:57] love that because I love children and elderly people. So through real estate,
[00:21:04] I found a way to also feel needed that I'm not getting paid because obviously I'm taking care
[00:21:11] of my clients and I'm getting paid. But I wanted to do something else that I was, I knew I was not
[00:21:16] going to get paid, but I could put an input. I could make somebody's, you know, job career,
[00:21:24] a business plan, anything better by just contributing. So that's why the moment I started my career
[00:21:32] in real estate, I looked for those options. And at that time, first it was Nareb. And then throughout
[00:21:38] my years in Nareb, I met other people that introduced me to YBN and other places that I
[00:21:45] volunteered my time within the industry. It started with that feeling of need or wanted to feel
[00:21:52] needed, non-paid and an of value for others. And real estate is such a broad, you know, that such
[00:22:01] it's just such a broad industry. There's so much you can do with this platform, but there's so much
[00:22:06] you can do within the industry. So serving was non-negotiable for me. Also, the plus of that is that
[00:22:14] I got to meet a lot more people and meeting a lot more people. I mean, I just close a deal with
[00:22:21] some of the YBN member, past members, that she didn't have the time to serve. So she sent me the
[00:22:29] referral. I took care of it. She got paid. I would pay. And it was a client I didn't have. She
[00:22:35] send it this way because she knows how I work. And she trusted me with her client. So that is also
[00:22:43] an opportunity by doing things for others. There's always the universe, like brings it back to you.
[00:22:49] Yeah. Yeah, that seems to be a recurring theme. I follow you on social media. I'm constantly
[00:22:57] checking to see what you and your partner Nancy, your teammate are up to. And you seem to be
[00:23:04] very service focused. And I'm curious. So you started with soccer. Where are your passions right
[00:23:10] now? What are you passionate about these days? I started soccer then it was dancing. Dancing to
[00:23:19] Culver. But when I say dancing, I mean social dancing, salsa and bachata. I started dancing
[00:23:26] to make more friends because my international friends went for Christmas home to the respective
[00:23:31] countries. And I was around the time I was stuck in the States. So I had no friends. I googled
[00:23:37] what to do when you have no friends. And I went to a social social and I started meeting people
[00:23:44] at dance. So dance became such a huge passion. So today love it. Absolutely love it. And I met a
[00:23:52] lot of people to to there. Cooking cooking is it's a great passion of mine too and and traveling.
[00:24:01] Anytime I have an opportunity to go somewhere I have not been. I'm very curious about the culture,
[00:24:09] the plays, the history, the architecture. So I would say those are probably my main ones. And
[00:24:15] one time allows and I always make time for I still volunteer within the community outside of real
[00:24:22] estate. I don't post about those. It's kind of I like it to keep it just like my private life. Sure.
[00:24:30] I'm below and but it still makes me very very happy.
[00:24:35] Yeah and you not only have you volunteered and been of service you have served in leadership
[00:24:44] positions in organizations such as the National Association of Hispanic Real Estate Professionals.
[00:24:50] So tell us about what Nile Rep is and what their goals are.
[00:24:59] Very very good question. Again always looking for that family. That's fear. That plays
[00:25:07] of calling home by being an immigrant and not having my own family here. Real estate can be a very
[00:25:16] lonely very very lonely career. And even though you meet all these clients all these people we spend a
[00:25:22] lot of time alone too when you're working on this file and this client behind the scenes. So
[00:25:29] the Nile Rep came along because of culture and some other REALTORS that you know what I think you're
[00:25:37] going to be great you know volunteering here because it's also people that look like you speak like
[00:25:44] you celebrate life like you have similar core values. So why don't you start here why don't you
[00:25:51] meet people within this group and and that's how I I got introduced to Nile Rep. My career within Nile Rep
[00:26:02] it went by fast. I don't know how to do things 50% 70% 25% if I say yes to some
[00:26:15] I'm going to give my 100% and if I don't then I will just not take it. So I took I took my role
[00:26:24] as my first year on the board very very serious and I ended up being the fastest growing youngest
[00:26:36] at the time precedent because I just worked really hard. I thought that's what everybody did.
[00:26:44] I thought that's what everybody does. So I put in a lot of time and now it's different different
[00:26:50] than other organizations. We're putting the work ourselves. We don't have a staff that does some
[00:26:55] of the going to the venues and getting quotes and all of these other um it behind the scenes work.
[00:27:03] We do it all and and I did a lot I did I did a lot. So leadership at that time saw that in me
[00:27:12] and and they just wanted to you know give me the opportunity to go into the executive or and
[00:27:20] and I skipped all the positions in the executive or and went directly to precedent.
[00:27:26] Well VP I would say I'm sorry vice president with obviously the the position the following year
[00:27:34] as president of the chapter and I loved it. I learned a lot and I gave my best. It also happened
[00:27:45] to be during time I don't know if we can get vulnerable here but most difficult time of my life
[00:27:51] where my mom was very ill and I was going back and forth to Spain to take care of her and her
[00:27:58] medical needs and until she left. So that was but I never quit in Arab that was not part of what I
[00:28:07] was going to do because I don't quit just don't quit. So that that's part of the leadership that
[00:28:14] I was giving the opportunity to to learn and to and to give. So that's kind of what in Arab
[00:28:22] how not how not why not. Yes and the you know that you were sharing with me a statistic about
[00:28:31] homeowner or first time home buyers in the United States and a significant percentage of those
[00:28:39] were of Hispanic origin. Correct. It's specifically 49.8% as of last year. So almost half of the
[00:28:50] home buyers for the year are Hispanic or where he's Hispanic for 2023. 2024 we'll see the numbers.
[00:28:58] I'm sure will be probably around 50 or a little bit more than that. We'll see the report next
[00:29:04] March on when those says come out but it's a huge huge percentage. So what do non-Hispanic
[00:29:14] REALTORS what should they know about the needs of Hispanic clients. I can people are people
[00:29:21] everyone's ultimately the same but within you know groups they may have different needs different
[00:29:28] specific you know just there's differences. So I'm curious what being that half of all the
[00:29:36] home purchases were done by people with who have Hispanic origin. What would you what would you
[00:29:43] suggest to somebody who wants to break into that market. It wants to you know start to serve those
[00:29:50] clients. Very very good question. So first of all let's let's move language challenge from the
[00:29:59] picture. A lot of these Hispanic stats are from first generation. There are people that are already
[00:30:08] even though they're Hispanic they do speak the language. So if somebody is afraid of not tapping
[00:30:13] into this market because oh I don't speak Spanish so I cannot serve a Spanish client or Hispanic
[00:30:19] client that would necessarily be the case. For the most part they speak English. If they do not
[00:30:27] speak English then you call me and I will take care of them and we'll work on a referral fee.
[00:30:33] So with that being said it is the word family is very very important for Hispanic buyers.
[00:30:44] So Hispanic buyers sometimes or a lot of times they buy as a family. They have the parents have
[00:30:55] been working really hard but they might still be itin or you know not having a social security
[00:31:01] or they might have not built a credit score throughout the years because the Hispanic community
[00:31:09] a lot of times by in cash everything the car the furniture. So they have not built a credit
[00:31:15] history but they're kids now that they are over 18 and they have been in school and they have
[00:31:22] work and they have good credit those are now the co-borrowers or the people that they are going to go
[00:31:29] in the loan with. So we have a lot of clients like that and we have to understand that in the
[00:31:37] showings in the consultations you're not just going to talk with the person on the loan
[00:31:44] because it might be a cousin that is letting them use the signature okay let me put it that way
[00:31:51] but you need to talk with the mom the dad the cousin they come with two children the grandma
[00:31:57] I don't know if the grandchildren but the grandma is coming too and then at the home inspection they're
[00:32:02] going to call the cousin and their and the other and the other so everybody is contributing to
[00:32:11] these purchase so we have to be very receiving very open-minded very welcoming to every decision
[00:32:21] maker not just the person that's on the loan this is this is a family affair because a lot of times
[00:32:28] they combine their incomes and they buy together so they can own his panics want to own they do
[00:32:37] now want to rent so they get together and they buy so a REALTOR to be fully equipped for a
[00:32:46] Hispanic family they need to be very welcoming they need to understand the culture they need to be
[00:32:52] open even if they don't understand info the culture they need to be open and open-minded they need
[00:32:57] to really explain the ins and the outs of the process for some of these families is the first time
[00:33:05] anybody in their family ever bought a home so they have no clue you have to speak apple to
[00:33:16] apple and explain the process and sit down with them they need more hand holding than other potential
[00:33:23] clients that their mom their cousin everybody else has bought a home it's they already they
[00:33:30] live in a home that was owned it's just different it's it's a cultural it's a generation it's a
[00:33:36] it's a family affair so those are some pointers happy to dip dip dip dip dip dip dip dip dip dip dip
[00:33:46] I was really taken by the idea that yes the families Hispanic families often pool their money
[00:33:53] together to purchase home because they want to support the family they want to continue to you know
[00:33:59] the the younger ones take care of the older ones and you know move around as a unit a a solid unit
[00:34:06] and that is something so when you are working with Hispanic clients who have you know their family
[00:34:13] with them you do serve many masters I guess and you really have to win over the whole family but I
[00:34:20] get I guess this brings us back to the original point is you become part of the family too right
[00:34:26] because you are now well you are now sort of by by this amazing thing that that they are now doing
[00:34:33] a first time home purchase that they've saved and worked hard and struggled and you are the gateway
[00:34:39] to this goal that they wanted to achieve I imagine that can be very emotional I suspect it can
[00:34:47] be very fulfilling and and just a lot of fun I bet it is it is fun it is emotional it is super
[00:34:58] fulfilling because for these families and I have actually two that are my if you can see that of
[00:35:03] Kevra but you said that and I it's for them it's not just the goal of or having a roof over the head
[00:35:13] it is their way of belonging to this country it is for them to set roots it is a place of worship
[00:35:24] it's going to be where the family gets together where the birthdays are celebrated with the
[00:35:31] funerals after funerals people get together and it is just such a family word in there
[00:35:37] and you're you're part of it you're giving them the keys to their American dream and
[00:35:45] and for that they are forever grateful and loyal working well and keeping their best interest
[00:35:55] at all times even if it's not the home that they like you know that's not that's just not for you
[00:36:01] keeping their best interest and helping them achieve that goal for them it opens
[00:36:08] generational wealth start point and and for me it opens a long lasting
[00:36:17] relationship where my pipeline of leads clients people being referred to it's never ending
[00:36:26] because they will tell everybody that no they know that oh no no no no you need to go with
[00:36:34] I know you absolutely need to go with I know she will take care of you she will do this for you
[00:36:39] and that is not paid that that's just not paid it is it is such a fulfillment
[00:36:48] well well you do not do everything alone you have a partner Nancy so tell us about why you decided
[00:36:56] to team up did why you needed to have another person with you and tell us how that's going
[00:37:04] awesome well I'm excited to talk about that I'm Nancy Nancy is a brilliant person and I say
[00:37:12] brilliant person forget about what we do on the on the business side she's just a great person to
[00:37:18] have nice to get and I have been very lucky and blessed to have met her and this goes back to 2020
[00:37:27] I was doing very well for myself close about 56 transactions on my own and but I started to see
[00:37:35] that my speed to response to the client was kind of decreasing that even my availability was
[00:37:43] a little bit more limited clients were sending me homes instead of me sending them homes anything
[00:37:50] that had made me unique special hands on was actually now being slightly neglected so I
[00:37:59] realized that at that time I needed to do something about that because I wanted the client to receive
[00:38:05] their response right away I wanted them to receive homes for me I wanted them to see homes now
[00:38:10] regardless of me doing the podcast they should be seeing homes as they are currently so I needed
[00:38:18] an extension of me of how I do things and and I saw Nancy had just joined the company
[00:38:28] and at that time I was kind of watching watching for some people I watched her I like how she
[00:38:34] will be dressed up I like how she would carry herself how she would speak so we had a little
[00:38:42] dinner with all women from the company and that day we it is a day that I formally met her just a
[00:38:50] few months after me watching her here and there I realized that I liked her but until that moment
[00:38:59] to actually talk and and go over things that night was was crucial so we were wearing the same clothes
[00:39:05] I don't know how we just met and we were wearing the same outfit and by the way that is normally
[00:39:12] that is normally for a woman to go to an event and have the same outfit as someone else that is
[00:39:20] like oh my god that's a disaster but in your case it was it was probably wonderful for me what's
[00:39:25] fine for me what's the sign I'm like okay I mean it wasn't like an easy oh yeah it's a little black
[00:39:30] dress that everybody can kind of think of no we're talking about like this black leather skirt like
[00:39:38] back to the knee the same heels and then the top wasn't a regular okay color like brown white or
[00:39:48] no it was this master yellow and I'm like we have the same haircut at the time I have my
[00:39:56] hair was very very sure it was like we were a replica we still have the photo and we bless about it
[00:40:02] so that night I had decided that okay these thoughts that I'm having these big overwhelm with work
[00:40:10] I think this person is the person so I talked to her and and she said yes immediately
[00:40:18] she quit her job and she joined full-time because she saw the vision and she saw the potential she
[00:40:26] wanted to learn by then I have been already doing real estate for four years and part-timing at
[00:40:32] the beginning but I already had a one full year for full-time by myself and I've shown her some
[00:40:39] success whatever success means to you but for me was what a few closing clients were happy
[00:40:45] and and she was eager to learn so she said yes and that was four years ago and change about 30 days
[00:40:56] more than that yeah really encourage everyone to follow Anoa and Nancy on Instagram we have links
[00:41:06] to their their Instagram accounts there Anoa REALTOR is the Instagram account to follow and
[00:41:12] what you'll find on there which I think is really endearing to both of you and the reason part
[00:41:19] of the reason why I had you on the show is you two you and your partner Nancy you look as if you're
[00:41:26] having so much fun what you know talking about real estate it's you know and I don't mean in a
[00:41:34] trivial way like oh triv everyone has fun no you you're you're providing value and having fun
[00:41:41] it makes me think I want to be on that team quite honestly I want to be I want to have that kind
[00:41:47] of level of fun and I think if you look at Anoa's Instagram account you'll probably have that
[00:41:55] that same reaction so this is a really great way to to to think about how might I want to start
[00:42:03] doing social media videos because look at Anoa and Nancy and what they do and the way they do it
[00:42:09] is it's like they're sisters right they're like you you you're basically sisters and you're
[00:42:15] you're doing these really impressive fun things tell us about did you were you always was it always
[00:42:22] a strategy to start doing videos or was that something that you guys decided on out of the blue
[00:42:30] well we haven't even got started that's just a little here and there um we want to do more and be
[00:42:38] like a lot more consistent with that but truth is we do have a lot of fun together outside of being
[00:42:46] real chores in the same team we are friends and we also not just laugh or encourage these videos
[00:42:54] we also cry together and we also go through life things together so we have these great
[00:43:01] bottom that regardless of what we do it's always with the smile it comes from respect love and care
[00:43:07] for the other person so it's a lot easier and more fun to be honest with you to do this job as I
[00:43:13] said initially it's it's quite lonely so if you find somebody that aligns with your core values how
[00:43:19] you want to do things worst hard and yeah it's good to build together for us it comes very naturally
[00:43:26] I mean we're not sisters she's from Mexico and from Spain we're not nowhere to be related maybe
[00:43:32] in a couple of millennia I don't know um but I don't think so um I'm a joker and she lets me do that
[00:43:43] she has a very creative eye and I let her do that um so it's it's kind of it complementing each other
[00:43:53] and this life or this life is this job I would say I'm sorry it's a lifestyle so if we're always
[00:44:00] working if we're always doing might as well just have some fun while doing it because we are
[00:44:07] spending a whole lot of time together and sometimes I I get bored too and I distract her she
[00:44:14] distract me and we take a pause and I do a stupid video sorry I don't know if we can save the bed
[00:44:19] but yeah so we we have some fun we have some fun selling houses it can be a lot more fun that some
[00:44:28] people might think um we are very professional very very serious and sharks when we have to
[00:44:37] negotiate and get things done but along the way we like to enjoy time and yeah I think that's the
[00:44:48] motto and because we make so many people happy you bring us so much I have in us so it's kind of
[00:44:54] what is the back yeah your social media really does radiate happiness there's there's a constant
[00:45:01] stream of client appreciation events videos about listings that you have where you're like oh look
[00:45:10] at this this is so cool this is you know you're excited you're energized it's it's really passionate
[00:45:17] to you it feels you can feel the passion coming out of those videos when you and Nancy
[00:45:23] decide to do a video do you talk about it ahead of time do you do write a script how how do you guys
[00:45:28] decide on what the video is going to be um a lot of times is in prompt too um when we want to be a
[00:45:39] little bit more intentional about a listing or something we're announcing or an event coming up
[00:45:46] and we want to be a little bit more polished we do take some time for the most part
[00:45:52] um we come up with the idea in either Nancy or myself and we just do it we like to be a first shot
[00:46:01] like the near first take should be the take so that's a lot of times when you can see some accent
[00:46:07] or some funny whatever a little face or and we're okay with that we don't we're not looking for
[00:46:14] the absolute perfect product uh we're looking to be genuine and whatever comes more naturally
[00:46:22] a when it comes to an announcement or an event a any piece of drip campaign meaning that we're
[00:46:28] going to have a few other videos coming for that same matter we are more strategic and I usually
[00:46:43] now realizing why I like your social media so much and I'm curious if your clients ever say this to
[00:46:49] you because when I see that you and Nancy have thrown some sort of event for your clients it looks
[00:46:55] so much fun it looks like and and and and I go oh I wish I would I wish I was there and I'll bet you
[00:47:04] that the way that you showcase these events I bet you the people that weren't able to attend
[00:47:10] have that same feeling of oh I wanted to be there I couldn't be there but I'm going to be there
[00:47:16] next time and that is particularly unique to you I think that is something that you and Nancy have
[00:47:23] done better than I've seen really anyone else in our marketplace do is create these events that people
[00:47:32] smile even if they weren't there and they go oh I I wish I was on that list I wish I was part of
[00:47:37] that group because it it really is very welcoming the way you guys film everything it is it's
[00:47:45] truly remarkable that you know I want to be part of the the the it's like the cool kids table at
[00:47:51] lunch in high school right I want to be a cool kids table and you guys seem like the cool kids
[00:47:58] table right like I I really impressed and I suspect those events get very very big attendance
[00:48:09] they do and they do and thank you for saying that I yeah um I can I can feel it I can see it um
[00:48:18] clients that they can make it the send us an email or they call the tax that they were sorry they
[00:48:24] couldn't come or they let us know in advance that they cannot come but please let them know
[00:48:29] what the next one is so we we have I mean our biggest event is in the summer and it's a summer
[00:48:37] picnic like a cookout to where no details miss um it's getting bigger and bigger we have
[00:48:42] hundreds of people attend that one and it's it's another way to reconnect with everybody and
[00:48:49] nothing is fake so the approach that we have had with our social media when it comes to these
[00:48:56] events and maybe that's what that's what you see is when we have our photographer um there
[00:49:02] they yes they can do portraits they can ask people hey you want to photo together and people are
[00:49:08] posing or we're posting with them that's cool but what I want you to do and this is what I tell
[00:49:14] the media person what I want you to do is shots candid like I need you to capture moments is a if a
[00:49:25] kid is painting somebody's hand or somebody's face with one of the brushes that we've given I
[00:49:33] want you to capture that moment I want you to capture smiles I want you to because that's really
[00:49:40] what's happening here people are not just posing for a photo that's barely this barely happening
[00:49:47] people are nothing they're connecting with one another we have games that they're not just for
[00:49:52] kids but for adults we play with um the Tago War is one of the most fun and everybody plays and
[00:50:01] people fall and the potato sack races and and they compete with one another and they bring a friend
[00:50:09] and there is it's just it's just what they would do with their friends right but it's paid off
[00:50:16] it's all organized you just have to show up and we really take the time to engage and play with you
[00:50:23] so the media person needs to capture those moments and we like to share with the rest of our social media
[00:50:32] these and we don't share everything uh sometimes you know if some things are more private within
[00:50:37] the events we don't share but if it's open to everybody and people are happy with sharing we put it
[00:50:44] there so other people can see how we do things which is genuine caring detail oriented like we that's
[00:50:54] how that's what we are so we want to make sure that we show who we are and how we do things and
[00:51:00] that's probably what you see I do I think authenticity is really the cornerstone to your success
[00:51:10] you would Nancy particular it emanates from your videos it emanates from your your voice is you
[00:51:19] are very intentional you you don't use uh additional words that just to lengthen a sentence for example
[00:51:28] but what you do is you're really intentional about giving people a good experience and that to me
[00:51:35] is really interesting even somebody like me who's not you know I by all means really I'm a consumer
[00:51:42] I'm a consumer of your content and I'm attracted to the content you create because it makes me feel
[00:51:50] like oh I want that and I thought that was some of the coolest stuff for for REALTOR a social media
[00:51:58] videos that I have seen where if you can get another REALTOR to go oh I want to do I want to have that
[00:52:05] then that that is that really lights me up so that is really what what you and Nancy have done and
[00:52:12] it's it's authentic it's you know it's based around family it's based around you know certain
[00:52:18] values and it obviously is a lot of fun and super fulfilling so I think you know we're wrapping
[00:52:25] this up we're really talking about you know authenticity I think is just being like what is your
[00:52:31] why well you have a why and and then it's just you know working really really really hard uh to and
[00:52:39] you know what advice would you have for a last question for a new agent who
[00:52:46] maybe move to Chicago like yourself with no sphere of influence what would you tell them to do
[00:52:52] who you know wants to build a real estate career um and that's a great way of rubbing this conversation
[00:53:00] just kind of how we started first I would say find a hobby and that is not something that you just
[00:53:08] randomly pick it's something that you pick because you're good at makes you feel happy
[00:53:16] you have the time for the means for so there's no pressure on oh it's just too far for me I cannot
[00:53:23] be consistent with that no something as simple as joining a sport or a gym or a damn dancing I would
[00:53:31] recommend dancing to everybody um but um dancing or cooking class or whatever it is that fits your
[00:53:40] your needs and wants when it comes to to hobbies absolutely and be very very consistent and when you
[00:53:48] do attend or you do go to those hobbies uh make sure to talk to people uh the end of the day this is a
[00:53:56] business of relationships it's always been it will always be regardless of AI and so many other
[00:54:03] things that they happen within the this industry is find a way to connect with more people on a one
[00:54:11] on one and you might not talk to 50 people the first day and they might not send you business right
[00:54:16] away then let's speak some other activity that you can do and something that I started doing is a
[00:54:22] lot of open houses I did not have my own listings but if you do join a brokerage where other agents are
[00:54:28] happy to share with you their listings um you could hold open houses for them and it's another way
[00:54:36] of meeting your strangers I didn't have money um to do other marketing campaigns so I knew that
[00:54:43] if I wanted to be the stranger potentially to buy a home because if they're coming to see a home
[00:54:47] more than likely want to buy a home so I said okay well if I know the most about these home
[00:54:54] our assailant's thing Asian everything I will learn about the area the restaurants the schools
[00:55:00] and if I will learn how many houses are for sale writing that in that block or in that neighborhood
[00:55:05] in that town and I will know the minimum price point so know your market know your data study
[00:55:12] and and be of value I never push anybody to do anything when it comes to like into Chelsea
[00:55:19] it's more about let me give you a tour let me explain this and listen that you connect with a person
[00:55:26] I sold many I mean I was a queen of open houses my first three years that's all I did every weekend
[00:55:32] sometimes twice three four times four open houses for weekend crazy but I still sell houses to
[00:55:38] people that I met eight years ago in open houses so I think open houses was really really key for me
[00:55:47] and if you like church or any other um space where you can meet more people being a hobby or not
[00:55:56] um yeah being part of your community enjoying something that is within within your community and
[00:56:02] help volunteer serve and you can meet more people that way you're not saying I'm a REALTOR and
[00:56:09] you know I wanted to sell houses left and right you're there to maybe do sub kitchen or folding
[00:56:17] clothes and given it to the Venezuelan community that is coming and they are intense outside
[00:56:24] police stations spray somehow chocolate and say hello and you'd never know where these
[00:56:30] subordinates will come from do well to others offered values serve fine hobbies I think those are
[00:56:38] some things that I would do if um if I was start to start over and now last one for social media
[00:56:47] um if I were to start over I would do just what we do now but I would do a more video I would talk
[00:56:55] about a specific neighborhood I would be constantly on my phone if I'm not busy I don't have
[00:57:00] these clients to do everything I will just become the Coca-Cola of that specific neighborhood
[00:57:07] um because I will spend the time and I would do everything in that specific neighborhood
[00:57:12] and record it because that's a three so well not free we pay for it yeah well almost free so you you
[00:57:21] have this really what what you're saying is study your market get immersed in the community
[00:57:29] get immersed in your passions meet people and just continue to serve give give give and when people
[00:57:38] need a REALTOR hopefully that you know you become the person that they choose because they see
[00:57:44] all of these other qualities that you've presented to them authentically um and they go oh I
[00:57:51] already knew I already like a Noah oh and I need to buy a house right so so that's that's kind of
[00:57:57] how it works so for anyone out there who's struggling with finding new clients you probably don't
[00:58:04] have to find new clients what you probably need to do is develop deeper relationships with your
[00:58:09] existing clients be immersed in their lives know when their children are going to school know what
[00:58:16] what grade they're in know what challenges the family may be facing know when the family might
[00:58:22] be thinking of upgrading their home right these are all things that you know you if it was your best
[00:58:28] friend you would know and so these are the kind of things that REALTORS can can really if they want to
[00:58:35] really start to develop you know deeper understanding of what these of what their clients need
[00:58:40] and and therefore you'll never you'll never be out of business because people will always need a good
[00:58:48] helping hand in particular but they need to know that they can trust that person so you can
[00:58:54] demonstrate trust through volunteering through passion through other things so I know you've
[00:59:00] said a lot today and I just you know really really um so grateful that you were able to come on
[00:59:07] and talk to us very intentionally about how you built your business and why family is so important

We are so grateful to have sponsors to help us keep the show rolling and they have amazing products and services for your business. All right, let's get right to it. My conversation with Anoa Garcia. My guest today is a friend of mine and somebody I am super excited to have on the show. Somebody I deeply admire. Her name is Anoa Garcia. She is a top 1% REALTOR here in Chicago. Let me tell you more about Anoa. Anoa Garcia is a Chicago real estate professional that graduated from the University of Cordoba in Spain and the University of Paul Verlain in France in translation and interpreted interpreting studies. And she moved to Chicago from Spain in 2012, discovered her passion for helping others through real estate, combining it with her love of design, business and communication. In 2023, Anoa served as the elected president of Naurip Chicago and is also a co-author of a best-selling book called Latinas in real estate. Anoa is committed to making every real estate transaction memorable for her clients and leads a top producing team. Outside of work, she travels, she cooks, she volunteers, she serves, and she is an all around just powerhouse of a person. And I've known her for many years and I'm super excited to have her. Please welcome Anoa Garcia to the show. Anoa, good to see you. Hi! First of all, you and I both have Spanish names. My name is Delphin and yours is Anoa and there is no real for Delphin. There is no English equivalent. Is there an English equivalent for Anoa in American? No, not at all. Not even. I mean, the sound you can say, I know a REALTOR. I know. You can play with the phonetics. That's about it. Oh, that is really funny. You have a great, really cool name, but more importantly, is what's, obviously beneath the name, which is all of your hard work and discipline, and your service. By the way, I want everybody to check out Anoa and her partner Nancy, her teammate, on their website. Anoa Garcia, hyphenco.com. There will be a link to that in the show notes. By the way, amazing website really showcases you and Nancy in a way that I think is very fresh and really highlights your personality. I think it's a well-done example for other REALTORS to follow. So Anoa Garcia, hyphenco.com. Again, link to that in the show notes. And I want you to follow Anoa on Instagram. You, I know what is your Instagram account. It's I know a REALTOR, A-I-N-A-T-O-A REALTOR. That's my annual. And we will have a link to that in the show notes. So I met Anoa many years ago. We served on a committee together at the local level here in Chicago, Illinois, at the Chicago Association of REALTORS. And I was very drawn to Anoa because she was one of the people on the committee that was very very serious about helping other REALTORS. She was very engaged and she really was quite generous with her time. And she's generous with her time again today, being on our show. So let's start all the way at the beginning. How did you not, how did you get to America? Because of course you took a plane and you got here. That's right. Why did you come here in 2012? Well, thank you so much for the invite and all your kind words. I really, really appreciate the opportunity to share with you and your audience. Thank you for having this platform and highlighting me today. So my story in America is sourced in 2012, as you said. And it was pretty random. I have made a few random decisions in my life that kind of build to these path into something else later. But I just saw an ad. I was in university at the lunch room. We had a micro-in-area for those who didn't have money to pay for lunch at the cafeteria. I brought my little container and I saw an ad that said, if you come and appear and leave the American dream. And I was finishing up university and the economic crisis was pretty heavily affecting Europe, Spain, Portugal, Greece in particular. And I was like, I'm going to finish university. I just had to come back from France. And I'm like, what am I going to do? I cannot go back home. I left when I was 16 years old. So I'm like, I cannot go back home. I need to find a solution. I need to find a job and recently graduated. Nobody was going to hire me at my space when I was at in Spain. So I called that phone number that I saw in the ad and I became an opair, which if you don't know is a leaving money. So I came and lived here with a wonderful family in all town. And after the first year, I extended for another year because I realized that Chicago was so much more. The America was so much bigger. And the economic crisis was still bad. So it's like, I'm not going to go back just yet. I need to improve in my English. And I need to be surrounded by English speaking people 24-7. So I can get better at that. And I decided to stay another year. And that's when everything changed. I met a lot more friends. I started to do fun things, not necessarily just working. My English got a lot better, so that opened other doors. And I became a nanny for a family in Roscoe Village. Wonderful, wonderful family. And I was no longer living nanny. Now I could do other things because I had an apartment. And I live with the family. So I could do other fun things that need more people. And my dream just got bigger and bigger and bigger over time. And actually, it's because of the father of the second family. That I'm in real estate. He told me to look, because I told him, it's about time. You know, I've been being here with you guys for five years. I love you, but I came to America with bigger dreams. I wanted that American dream. And being a nanny, even though I had no worries. And he was a well-payed job. I wanted more out of life. So I said, I'm going to be thinking of leaving. And he said, why don't you do sales? Why don't you do real estate? And at that time, I didn't even know where real estate was. And I had to kind of like Google it. So yeah, that's kind of how things got to get started in real estate here. You know, it's amazing. It's something that for those of us born in this country, we often forget that people come to America for all sorts of different reasons. And highly educated people like yourself, who found an opportunity here to do something. And then, you know, you're being here allows you at the possibility to build this business that you really wanted to build. So was it difficult or how difficult was it being somebody who's not a native, you know, American to, you know, look, you know, Chicago is where I know and I both reside. But there's not a huge population of Spanish people in Chicago. There's a lot of people from Latin America, of course, in Mexico. But there's not a lot of Spanish. So curious on how did you start to integrate with the culture? How did you find clients? You know, what was that process like? So I'm very glad that you said that you correct to yourself. But you said, was it difficult or how difficult? There was nothing easy about this journey. But the reward of something bigger, the vision was so much larger that I never gave up that dream. So starting, let's say that first of all, I did not speak the language. I couldn't understand when people would talk to me. I knew how to write in English, but I did not know how to speak or understand what people would talk to me. But I made it a goal. I made it a goal to learn as fast as possible. I am a linguistic person. So it didn't take me as long as I know other people. I have, but I just made it a goal. I was like, okay, you're going to listen to every podcast. You're going to talk to everybody. It doesn't matter if you have an accent or not. You're just going to get yourself in this uncomfortable situations where you need to figure it out yourself. So the language was one of the challenges that I got to surpass or accomplish. Immigration and status as an immigrant is a whole nother at home. Because obviously without a legal status, you cannot be in this country. So I have my own set of struggles with that part. I was in this country for a long time, almost four years without being able to see my mom, my dad, my dad, everybody that I knew home. I couldn't leave the country. If I left, I wouldn't be able to come back because my process was, or my case was in process. So that alone made very difficult years of learning, of making money, of having, you know, working 128 hours a week. That's from 530 to 1130 Monday through Sunday. No days off for three years straight. So that's a lot that's a lot to take, but I was very young and it was eager to do and learn and so immigration was another challenge. So the language, immigration, and then as I started taking the first steps into real estate, I realized that I didn't have that as fear of influence. Because when you are a REALTOR, especially a new REALTOR, your first clients are going to be people that already know you, they trust you. Your friends? Yeah, your friends. It's going to be, you know, your mom's neighbor, your friend from college, your, these person, these other persons. So I did not have that. What I had was desire of learning, love for people. So I needed to find ideas and ways to be in front of more people that over time, they will learn to like me, trust me, and buy anything I would sell. So that's how I got everything to make sense. Once the language was not a problem, once the immigration was in process and I went through, I just picked hobbies. I picked a whole lot of different hobbies starting with soccer because that's something that I loved back home and that I play in co-ed teams. So I decided to join a team here and that was a way of meeting people. Still today, I keep in touch and I sell my first homes. It was to people from my soccer sphere. My, my boss, he as a hockey player and he sold 20 homes over the course of his, you know, five or six years when he was practicing to all the guys on his hockey team. And so it is funny that these passions, it's a great way to expand your sphere and also, do something fun for yourself but a lot of times business comes from it. It does and it's not a cushy way, it's not a, you're not selling really anything, you're getting to know people, people are getting to know you who you are as a person and then it happens. Oh, that you sell real estate. Actually, I need to, I want to buy, I want to sell. I know somebody that, and that's how things started and he was very, very organic and that's kind of how the family, probably my family of clients has grown throughout the years. Now you call them your family of clients. That is very intentional. Tell me why you say that. I do not have any family here in America. So any person that I would connect with, they would become at some point, I mean, if the person is very genuine, I've met all kind of people just like everybody does, right? Before the most part, the people that I connected the most, they were very genuine and they, when you become a close friend of someone or somebody that you see often or somebody that you just like, even if you don't see them often, like you and I don't see each other often, but we, I always have like a, you know, a great thought and feeling about, you know, if your name comes along or I'm like, oh, yeah, DJs, it's a feeling. So that's kind of how I started creating these, these family feeling is because they were my support system of times and I consumed myself with work because I didn't have family to hang out with. So I hang out with my clients and I went to their birthdays and to their housewarming and to anything that was family sure. You know, it's, I'm touching on the subject because I think it's a great opportunity for our listeners to think about is, you know, Anoa said, hey, I have a family of clients, it's not a marketing piece that she's trying to do. She's, she's not, she really truly thinks of her clients, some of her clients in that fashion and she celebrates family events with her clients. And I think, you know, that that's what family does. That's exactly what I'm here in Puriya for a funeral because that's what my friends are my family as well. And, and so, you know, that's what you do. And that is a remarkable really, you immersed yourself into, into Chicago, into our, you know, this culture where you knew nobody and you really started. So we know you got into hobbies, but you also really started serving and volunteering. And I can't imagine you have so many, there were so many difficulties in your path anyway, the language, no sphere of influence, no support system here. And oh, by the way, I'm going to donate some of my time and energy that probably I don't have to, to give back to the community. So can you tell us a little bit about why you started volunteering because as early as you did? Actually, it was even earlier than that. I haven't sure that with you before, but the moment I landed in America without knowing the language or anything, I knew that I wanted to feel needed. It's a, it's a feeling that I've always wanted to have. If you think I wanted to be a doctor because you're going to save lives or somebody's going to need you so much, almost like a mother feels. So with my first job, I had a little time off and I wanted to fill it up with something else that would make me feel needed. And it started with Casa Advocates, which is Casa of Cucone, core to point to the special advocates. And I was with the same case for five and a half years. So if somebody doesn't know Casa, it's for children in foster care. I was technically a big sister. I would do monthly visits and all those things. And I would go to court and percent I report to the judge so they could make a decision on their placement. So I absolutely, absolutely love that because I love children and elderly people. So through real estate, I found a way to also feel needed that I'm not getting paid because obviously I'm taking care of my clients and I'm getting paid. But I wanted to do something else that I was, I knew I was not going to get paid, but I could put an input. I could make somebody's, you know, job career, a business plan, anything better by just contributing. So that's why the moment I started my career in real estate, I looked for those options. And at that time, first it was Nareb. And then throughout my years in Nareb, I met other people that introduced me to YBN and other places that I volunteered my time within the industry. It started with that feeling of need or wanted to feel needed, non-paid and an of value for others. And real estate is such a broad, you know, that such it's just such a broad industry. There's so much you can do with this platform, but there's so much you can do within the industry. So serving was non-negotiable for me. Also, the plus of that is that I got to meet a lot more people and meeting a lot more people. I mean, I just close a deal with some of the YBN member, past members, that she didn't have the time to serve. So she sent me the referral. I took care of it. She got paid. I would pay. And it was a client I didn't have. She send it this way because she knows how I work. And she trusted me with her client. So that is also an opportunity by doing things for others. There's always the universe, like brings it back to you. Yeah. Yeah, that seems to be a recurring theme. I follow you on social media. I'm constantly checking to see what you and your partner Nancy, your teammate are up to. And you seem to be very service focused. And I'm curious. So you started with soccer. Where are your passions right now? What are you passionate about these days? I started soccer then it was dancing. Dancing to Culver. But when I say dancing, I mean social dancing, salsa and bachata. I started dancing to make more friends because my international friends went for Christmas home to the respective countries. And I was around the time I was stuck in the States. So I had no friends. I googled what to do when you have no friends. And I went to a social social and I started meeting people at dance. So dance became such a huge passion. So today love it. Absolutely love it. And I met a lot of people to to there. Cooking cooking is it's a great passion of mine too and and traveling. Anytime I have an opportunity to go somewhere I have not been. I'm very curious about the culture, the plays, the history, the architecture. So I would say those are probably my main ones. And one time allows and I always make time for I still volunteer within the community outside of real estate. I don't post about those. It's kind of I like it to keep it just like my private life. Sure. I'm below and but it still makes me very very happy. Yeah and you not only have you volunteered and been of service you have served in leadership positions in organizations such as the National Association of Hispanic Real Estate Professionals. So tell us about what Nile Rep is and what their goals are. Very very good question. Again always looking for that family. That's fear. That plays of calling home by being an immigrant and not having my own family here. Real estate can be a very lonely very very lonely career. And even though you meet all these clients all these people we spend a lot of time alone too when you're working on this file and this client behind the scenes. So the Nile Rep came along because of culture and some other REALTORS that you know what I think you're going to be great you know volunteering here because it's also people that look like you speak like you celebrate life like you have similar core values. So why don't you start here why don't you meet people within this group and and that's how I I got introduced to Nile Rep. My career within Nile Rep it went by fast. I don't know how to do things 50% 70% 25% if I say yes to some I'm going to give my 100% and if I don't then I will just not take it. So I took I took my role as my first year on the board very very serious and I ended up being the fastest growing youngest at the time precedent because I just worked really hard. I thought that's what everybody did. I thought that's what everybody does. So I put in a lot of time and now it's different different than other organizations. We're putting the work ourselves. We don't have a staff that does some of the going to the venues and getting quotes and all of these other um it behind the scenes work. We do it all and and I did a lot I did I did a lot. So leadership at that time saw that in me and and they just wanted to you know give me the opportunity to go into the executive or and and I skipped all the positions in the executive or and went directly to precedent. Well VP I would say I'm sorry vice president with obviously the the position the following year as president of the chapter and I loved it. I learned a lot and I gave my best. It also happened to be during time I don't know if we can get vulnerable here but most difficult time of my life where my mom was very ill and I was going back and forth to Spain to take care of her and her medical needs and until she left. So that was but I never quit in Arab that was not part of what I was going to do because I don't quit just don't quit. So that that's part of the leadership that I was giving the opportunity to to learn and to and to give. So that's kind of what in Arab how not how not why not. Yes and the you know that you were sharing with me a statistic about homeowner or first time home buyers in the United States and a significant percentage of those were of Hispanic origin. Correct. It's specifically 49.8% as of last year. So almost half of the home buyers for the year are Hispanic or where he's Hispanic for 2023. 2024 we'll see the numbers. I'm sure will be probably around 50 or a little bit more than that. We'll see the report next March on when those says come out but it's a huge huge percentage. So what do non-Hispanic REALTORS what should they know about the needs of Hispanic clients. I can people are people everyone's ultimately the same but within you know groups they may have different needs different specific you know just there's differences. So I'm curious what being that half of all the home purchases were done by people with who have Hispanic origin. What would you what would you suggest to somebody who wants to break into that market. It wants to you know start to serve those clients. Very very good question. So first of all let's let's move language challenge from the picture. A lot of these Hispanic stats are from first generation. There are people that are already even though they're Hispanic they do speak the language. So if somebody is afraid of not tapping into this market because oh I don't speak Spanish so I cannot serve a Spanish client or Hispanic client that would necessarily be the case. For the most part they speak English. If they do not speak English then you call me and I will take care of them and we'll work on a referral fee. So with that being said it is the word family is very very important for Hispanic buyers. So Hispanic buyers sometimes or a lot of times they buy as a family. They have the parents have been working really hard but they might still be itin or you know not having a social security or they might have not built a credit score throughout the years because the Hispanic community a lot of times by in cash everything the car the furniture. So they have not built a credit history but they're kids now that they are over 18 and they have been in school and they have work and they have good credit those are now the co-borrowers or the people that they are going to go in the loan with. So we have a lot of clients like that and we have to understand that in the showings in the consultations you're not just going to talk with the person on the loan because it might be a cousin that is letting them use the signature okay let me put it that way but you need to talk with the mom the dad the cousin they come with two children the grandma I don't know if the grandchildren but the grandma is coming too and then at the home inspection they're going to call the cousin and their and the other and the other so everybody is contributing to these purchase so we have to be very receiving very open-minded very welcoming to every decision maker not just the person that's on the loan this is this is a family affair because a lot of times they combine their incomes and they buy together so they can own his panics want to own they do now want to rent so they get together and they buy so a REALTOR to be fully equipped for a Hispanic family they need to be very welcoming they need to understand the culture they need to be open even if they don't understand info the culture they need to be open and open-minded they need to really explain the ins and the outs of the process for some of these families is the first time anybody in their family ever bought a home so they have no clue you have to speak apple to apple and explain the process and sit down with them they need more hand holding than other potential clients that their mom their cousin everybody else has bought a home it's they already they live in a home that was owned it's just different it's it's a cultural it's a generation it's a it's a family affair so those are some pointers happy to dip dip dip dip dip dip dip dip dip dip dip I was really taken by the idea that yes the families Hispanic families often pool their money together to purchase home because they want to support the family they want to continue to you know the the younger ones take care of the older ones and you know move around as a unit a a solid unit and that is something so when you are working with Hispanic clients who have you know their family with them you do serve many masters I guess and you really have to win over the whole family but I get I guess this brings us back to the original point is you become part of the family too right because you are now well you are now sort of by by this amazing thing that that they are now doing a first time home purchase that they've saved and worked hard and struggled and you are the gateway to this goal that they wanted to achieve I imagine that can be very emotional I suspect it can be very fulfilling and and just a lot of fun I bet it is it is fun it is emotional it is super fulfilling because for these families and I have actually two that are my if you can see that of Kevra but you said that and I it's for them it's not just the goal of or having a roof over the head it is their way of belonging to this country it is for them to set roots it is a place of worship it's going to be where the family gets together where the birthdays are celebrated with the funerals after funerals people get together and it is just such a family word in there and you're you're part of it you're giving them the keys to their American dream and and for that they are forever grateful and loyal working well and keeping their best interest at all times even if it's not the home that they like you know that's not that's just not for you keeping their best interest and helping them achieve that goal for them it opens generational wealth start point and and for me it opens a long lasting relationship where my pipeline of leads clients people being referred to it's never ending because they will tell everybody that no they know that oh no no no no you need to go with I know you absolutely need to go with I know she will take care of you she will do this for you and that is not paid that that's just not paid it is it is such a fulfillment well well you do not do everything alone you have a partner Nancy so tell us about why you decided to team up did why you needed to have another person with you and tell us how that's going awesome well I'm excited to talk about that I'm Nancy Nancy is a brilliant person and I say brilliant person forget about what we do on the on the business side she's just a great person to have nice to get and I have been very lucky and blessed to have met her and this goes back to 2020 I was doing very well for myself close about 56 transactions on my own and but I started to see that my speed to response to the client was kind of decreasing that even my availability was a little bit more limited clients were sending me homes instead of me sending them homes anything that had made me unique special hands on was actually now being slightly neglected so I realized that at that time I needed to do something about that because I wanted the client to receive their response right away I wanted them to receive homes for me I wanted them to see homes now regardless of me doing the podcast they should be seeing homes as they are currently so I needed an extension of me of how I do things and and I saw Nancy had just joined the company and at that time I was kind of watching watching for some people I watched her I like how she will be dressed up I like how she would carry herself how she would speak so we had a little dinner with all women from the company and that day we it is a day that I formally met her just a few months after me watching her here and there I realized that I liked her but until that moment to actually talk and and go over things that night was was crucial so we were wearing the same clothes I don't know how we just met and we were wearing the same outfit and by the way that is normally that is normally for a woman to go to an event and have the same outfit as someone else that is like oh my god that's a disaster but in your case it was it was probably wonderful for me what's fine for me what's the sign I'm like okay I mean it wasn't like an easy oh yeah it's a little black dress that everybody can kind of think of no we're talking about like this black leather skirt like back to the knee the same heels and then the top wasn't a regular okay color like brown white or no it was this master yellow and I'm like we have the same haircut at the time I have my hair was very very sure it was like we were a replica we still have the photo and we bless about it so that night I had decided that okay these thoughts that I'm having these big overwhelm with work I think this person is the person so I talked to her and and she said yes immediately she quit her job and she joined full-time because she saw the vision and she saw the potential she wanted to learn by then I have been already doing real estate for four years and part-timing at the beginning but I already had a one full year for full-time by myself and I've shown her some success whatever success means to you but for me was what a few closing clients were happy and and she was eager to learn so she said yes and that was four years ago and change about 30 days more than that yeah really encourage everyone to follow Anoa and Nancy on Instagram we have links to their their Instagram accounts there Anoa REALTOR is the Instagram account to follow and what you'll find on there which I think is really endearing to both of you and the reason part of the reason why I had you on the show is you two you and your partner Nancy you look as if you're having so much fun what you know talking about real estate it's you know and I don't mean in a trivial way like oh triv everyone has fun no you you're you're providing value and having fun it makes me think I want to be on that team quite honestly I want to be I want to have that kind of level of fun and I think if you look at Anoa's Instagram account you'll probably have that that same reaction so this is a really great way to to to think about how might I want to start doing social media videos because look at Anoa and Nancy and what they do and the way they do it is it's like they're sisters right they're like you you you're basically sisters and you're you're doing these really impressive fun things tell us about did you were you always was it always a strategy to start doing videos or was that something that you guys decided on out of the blue well we haven't even got started that's just a little here and there um we want to do more and be like a lot more consistent with that but truth is we do have a lot of fun together outside of being real chores in the same team we are friends and we also not just laugh or encourage these videos we also cry together and we also go through life things together so we have these great bottom that regardless of what we do it's always with the smile it comes from respect love and care for the other person so it's a lot easier and more fun to be honest with you to do this job as I said initially it's it's quite lonely so if you find somebody that aligns with your core values how you want to do things worst hard and yeah it's good to build together for us it comes very naturally I mean we're not sisters she's from Mexico and from Spain we're not nowhere to be related maybe in a couple of millennia I don't know um but I don't think so um I'm a joker and she lets me do that she has a very creative eye and I let her do that um so it's it's kind of it complementing each other and this life or this life is this job I would say I'm sorry it's a lifestyle so if we're always working if we're always doing might as well just have some fun while doing it because we are spending a whole lot of time together and sometimes I I get bored too and I distract her she distract me and we take a pause and I do a stupid video sorry I don't know if we can save the bed but yeah so we we have some fun we have some fun selling houses it can be a lot more fun that some people might think um we are very professional very very serious and sharks when we have to negotiate and get things done but along the way we like to enjoy time and yeah I think that's the motto and because we make so many people happy you bring us so much I have in us so it's kind of what is the back yeah your social media really does radiate happiness there's there's a constant stream of client appreciation events videos about listings that you have where you're like oh look at this this is so cool this is you know you're excited you're energized it's it's really passionate to you it feels you can feel the passion coming out of those videos when you and Nancy decide to do a video do you talk about it ahead of time do you do write a script how how do you guys decide on what the video is going to be um a lot of times is in prompt too um when we want to be a little bit more intentional about a listing or something we're announcing or an event coming up and we want to be a little bit more polished we do take some time for the most part um we come up with the idea in either Nancy or myself and we just do it we like to be a first shot like the near first take should be the take so that's a lot of times when you can see some accent or some funny whatever a little face or and we're okay with that we don't we're not looking for the absolute perfect product uh we're looking to be genuine and whatever comes more naturally a when it comes to an announcement or an event a any piece of drip campaign meaning that we're going to have a few other videos coming for that same matter we are more strategic and I usually now realizing why I like your social media so much and I'm curious if your clients ever say this to you because when I see that you and Nancy have thrown some sort of event for your clients it looks so much fun it looks like and and and and I go oh I wish I would I wish I was there and I'll bet you that the way that you showcase these events I bet you the people that weren't able to attend have that same feeling of oh I wanted to be there I couldn't be there but I'm going to be there next time and that is particularly unique to you I think that is something that you and Nancy have done better than I've seen really anyone else in our marketplace do is create these events that people smile even if they weren't there and they go oh I I wish I was on that list I wish I was part of that group because it it really is very welcoming the way you guys film everything it is it's truly remarkable that you know I want to be part of the the the it's like the cool kids table at lunch in high school right I want to be a cool kids table and you guys seem like the cool kids table right like I I really impressed and I suspect those events get very very big attendance they do and they do and thank you for saying that I yeah um I can I can feel it I can see it um clients that they can make it the send us an email or they call the tax that they were sorry they couldn't come or they let us know in advance that they cannot come but please let them know what the next one is so we we have I mean our biggest event is in the summer and it's a summer picnic like a cookout to where no details miss um it's getting bigger and bigger we have hundreds of people attend that one and it's it's another way to reconnect with everybody and nothing is fake so the approach that we have had with our social media when it comes to these events and maybe that's what that's what you see is when we have our photographer um there they yes they can do portraits they can ask people hey you want to photo together and people are posing or we're posting with them that's cool but what I want you to do and this is what I tell the media person what I want you to do is shots candid like I need you to capture moments is a if a kid is painting somebody's hand or somebody's face with one of the brushes that we've given I want you to capture that moment I want you to capture smiles I want you to because that's really what's happening here people are not just posing for a photo that's barely this barely happening people are nothing they're connecting with one another we have games that they're not just for kids but for adults we play with um the Tago War is one of the most fun and everybody plays and people fall and the potato sack races and and they compete with one another and they bring a friend and there is it's just it's just what they would do with their friends right but it's paid off it's all organized you just have to show up and we really take the time to engage and play with you so the media person needs to capture those moments and we like to share with the rest of our social media these and we don't share everything uh sometimes you know if some things are more private within the events we don't share but if it's open to everybody and people are happy with sharing we put it there so other people can see how we do things which is genuine caring detail oriented like we that's how that's what we are so we want to make sure that we show who we are and how we do things and that's probably what you see I do I think authenticity is really the cornerstone to your success you would Nancy particular it emanates from your videos it emanates from your your voice is you are very intentional you you don't use uh additional words that just to lengthen a sentence for example but what you do is you're really intentional about giving people a good experience and that to me is really interesting even somebody like me who's not you know I by all means really I'm a consumer I'm a consumer of your content and I'm attracted to the content you create because it makes me feel like oh I want that and I thought that was some of the coolest stuff for for REALTOR a social media videos that I have seen where if you can get another REALTOR to go oh I want to do I want to have that then that that is that really lights me up so that is really what what you and Nancy have done and it's it's authentic it's you know it's based around family it's based around you know certain values and it obviously is a lot of fun and super fulfilling so I think you know we're wrapping this up we're really talking about you know authenticity I think is just being like what is your why well you have a why and and then it's just you know working really really really hard uh to and you know what advice would you have for a last question for a new agent who maybe move to Chicago like yourself with no sphere of influence what would you tell them to do who you know wants to build a real estate career um and that's a great way of rubbing this conversation just kind of how we started first I would say find a hobby and that is not something that you just randomly pick it's something that you pick because you're good at makes you feel happy you have the time for the means for so there's no pressure on oh it's just too far for me I cannot be consistent with that no something as simple as joining a sport or a gym or a damn dancing I would recommend dancing to everybody um but um dancing or cooking class or whatever it is that fits your your needs and wants when it comes to to hobbies absolutely and be very very consistent and when you do attend or you do go to those hobbies uh make sure to talk to people uh the end of the day this is a business of relationships it's always been it will always be regardless of AI and so many other things that they happen within the this industry is find a way to connect with more people on a one on one and you might not talk to 50 people the first day and they might not send you business right away then let's speak some other activity that you can do and something that I started doing is a lot of open houses I did not have my own listings but if you do join a brokerage where other agents are happy to share with you their listings um you could hold open houses for them and it's another way of meeting your strangers I didn't have money um to do other marketing campaigns so I knew that if I wanted to be the stranger potentially to buy a home because if they're coming to see a home more than likely want to buy a home so I said okay well if I know the most about these home our assailant's thing Asian everything I will learn about the area the restaurants the schools and if I will learn how many houses are for sale writing that in that block or in that neighborhood in that town and I will know the minimum price point so know your market know your data study and and be of value I never push anybody to do anything when it comes to like into Chelsea it's more about let me give you a tour let me explain this and listen that you connect with a person I sold many I mean I was a queen of open houses my first three years that's all I did every weekend sometimes twice three four times four open houses for weekend crazy but I still sell houses to people that I met eight years ago in open houses so I think open houses was really really key for me and if you like church or any other um space where you can meet more people being a hobby or not um yeah being part of your community enjoying something that is within within your community and help volunteer serve and you can meet more people that way you're not saying I'm a REALTOR and you know I wanted to sell houses left and right you're there to maybe do sub kitchen or folding clothes and given it to the Venezuelan community that is coming and they are intense outside police stations spray somehow chocolate and say hello and you'd never know where these subordinates will come from do well to others offered values serve fine hobbies I think those are some things that I would do if um if I was start to start over and now last one for social media um if I were to start over I would do just what we do now but I would do a more video I would talk about a specific neighborhood I would be constantly on my phone if I'm not busy I don't have these clients to do everything I will just become the Coca-Cola of that specific neighborhood um because I will spend the time and I would do everything in that specific neighborhood and record it because that's a three so well not free we pay for it yeah well almost free so you you have this really what what you're saying is study your market get immersed in the community get immersed in your passions meet people and just continue to serve give give give and when people need a REALTOR hopefully that you know you become the person that they choose because they see all of these other qualities that you've presented to them authentically um and they go oh I already knew I already like a Noah oh and I need to buy a house right so so that's that's kind of how it works so for anyone out there who's struggling with finding new clients you probably don't have to find new clients what you probably need to do is develop deeper relationships with your existing clients be immersed in their lives know when their children are going to school know what what grade they're in know what challenges the family may be facing know when the family might be thinking of upgrading their home right these are all things that you know you if it was your best friend you would know and so these are the kind of things that REALTORS can can really if they want to really start to develop you know deeper understanding of what these of what their clients need and and therefore you'll never you'll never be out of business because people will always need a good helping hand in particular but they need to know that they can trust that person so you can demonstrate trust through volunteering through passion through other things so I know you've said a lot today and I just you know really really um so grateful that you were able to come on and talk to us very intentionally about how you built your business and why family is so important and you know service and just being um you know working really hard on top of all of that and I just want to thank you on behalf of our audience for uh for your your time and just sharing
