[00:01:17] Today's episode is brought to you by corded.io.
[00:01:20] Are you looking for agents to join your brokerage or team?
[00:01:24] Now as a real estate recruiter, I can tell you the answer is always yes.
[00:01:28] But most agents aren't looking to move right now.
[00:01:31] So how do you know who to contact?
[00:01:33] Well, what if I were to tell you there's a recruiting and retention tool powered by
[00:01:37] artificial intelligence that shows you exactly which agents in your local market are looking
[00:01:42] to leave their brokerage right now and which agents at your own firm are also looking
[00:01:48] to leave you?
[00:01:49] Now I've been recruiting REALTORS for 15 years and I've hired over 2000 agents.
[00:01:54] I can tell you with no exaggeration, this is the tool I've been waiting for.
[00:01:58] Corded's AI looks for trends across dozens of variables for each agent in your market
[00:02:03] and shows you which agents they believe are likely to move.
[00:02:06] Not only does it do that, but corded's AI went and visited my recruiting website and
[00:02:12] read everything I offer.
[00:02:13] So now when I'm recruiting, corded's AI tells me exactly what to say based on that
[00:02:18] agent's needs and what my brokerage can offer.
[00:02:21] It even writes emails for me.
[00:02:23] I've never seen anything like it and I use it every single day.
[00:02:27] Now if you are looking to grow your brokerage, corded.io is the best tool out there.

[00:02:54] Hello and welcome to another episode of Keeping It Real, the largest podcast made by real estate
[00:02:59] agents and four real estate agents.
[00:03:01] My name is DJ Paris.
[00:03:03] I am your guide and host through the show.
[00:03:04] And just a moment, we're going to be speaking with the CEO of T360 which is the largest consulting
[00:03:10] firm for residential real estate brokerages and REALTORS, Jack Miller.
[00:03:14] Before we get to Jack Miller, just a few quick reminders.
[00:03:17] As always, please help us by telling a friend about this episode, especially this one.
[00:03:22] This is a particularly good one to send to not just the REALTORS in your office, but also
[00:03:27] the owner of your company or your managing broker.
[00:03:29] There's a lot of good stuff here about how to help brokerages and REALTORS run more effectively.
[00:03:34] We're going to get to that in just a second.
[00:03:36] In addition to telling a friend, please leave us a review.
[00:03:38] Let us know what you think of the show.
[00:03:40] It helps us get in front of more ears as well as helps us learn what you like and what
[00:03:45] we can do to improve.
[00:03:46] But let's just get right to it.
[00:03:47] My conversation with Jack Miller.
[00:04:04] Hey, today on the show, my guest is Jack Miller.
[00:04:08] Who's the CEO of T360, which is a real estate consulting agency.
[00:04:13] I'll tell you more about Jack and T360.
[00:04:15] Jack is responsible for the overall management and financial health of T360.
[00:04:20] He previously served as T360's chief technology officer and lead of T3 Fellows, which is
[00:04:27] a division of T360.
[00:04:29] He has two decades of real estate industry experience with management roles in franchising, franchise
[00:04:34] ownership and brokerage.
[00:04:36] Prior to joining the real estate industry, Jack worked in multiple technology startup
[00:04:40] companies, including as a partner and investor.
[00:04:43] He is a consistent contributor to the Swannipoll trends report, as well as various white
[00:04:48] papers and abstracts on technology.
[00:04:51] Jack has a bachelor's of science in electrical and computer engineering from the University
[00:04:56] of Texas.
[00:04:57] For those of you that go, I do not know T360.
[00:05:00] I will tell you from a brokerage perspective, they are the news source and the data source
[00:05:05] and the analysts that brokerages look to to say, what's going on in the industry, what's
[00:05:10] the health of the industry, where is it going?
[00:05:13] This is the company that we all look to.
[00:05:15] This is a very special episode for me to talk to.
[00:05:19] The CEO, Jack, welcome to the show.
[00:05:22] DJ, I'm delighted to be here and to be here with your listeners.
[00:05:25] We're going to do some fun stuff today.
[00:05:28] Yeah, let's dive right into it.
[00:05:30] Before we get started, I would love to just set this table.
[00:05:35] For what T360 is and how it got started and how it got to where it is today.
[00:05:40] Yeah, and I'll use it as a little opportunity to give my bios and color because it's, I
[00:05:46] think people hear that and they're like, does Jack know anything about our industry because
[00:05:49] I can't tell, right?
[00:05:50] Because it's a little, it's high level.
[00:05:52] But I came to the industry in 2001 and I worked for a national franchise.
[00:05:56] I actually worked directly for Gary Keller and Moanderson when they were building Kevileums
[00:06:01] into a national company.
[00:06:03] It was really a regional franchise company at the time and I did come out of the tech
[00:06:06] industry.
[00:06:07] But I've been in the industry since then and have owned and operated franchises in the
[00:06:12] Kevileums network, have run an independent brokerage here in Austin with some partners
[00:06:17] and got licensed and sold real estate myself.
[00:06:20] And so for a lot of your listeners, it's like, I've been in your chair.
[00:06:23] There's almost no part of franchise brokerage, all of those things that I've not done.
[00:06:30] And I have enormous passion for.
[00:06:33] And so that's what I'll say just about my personal background is I became, I started as
[00:06:38] a tech guy, I became a real estate person in 2001 and have just fallen in love with this
[00:06:42] industry ever since.
[00:06:43] Our team, we have about 40 people that work for T360 and our media affiliate, real estate
[00:06:48] news.
[00:06:49] T360, we decided to design a consulting and management company really for residential
[00:06:57] brokerage industry.
[00:06:58] And, you know, there's a lot of big consulting companies like McKinsey or Pricewater,
[00:07:02] Cooper, KPMG.
[00:07:04] And they, you know, they serve the financial industry and the healthcare industry and all
[00:07:07] these other industries.
[00:07:08] There really has not been the equivalent of those kinds of companies for residential brokerage.
[00:07:14] And so we currently serve about 300 clients in the brokerage, MLS, association and technology
[00:07:22] space that all do work in residential real estate brokerage.
[00:07:25] So it's all residential estate brokerage focused.
[00:07:27] We're doing a little bit of work in mortgage right now.
[00:07:30] There's some opportunities in that space that we're exploring.
[00:07:34] And we also produce two books a year.
[00:07:36] We do the Swanthal Trends report, which is known as 20th edition.
[00:07:41] And that's an overview of the trends that we believe will impact the industry for the
[00:07:44] next two to three years.
[00:07:46] Essential reading for anybody in real estate leadership, we believe.
[00:07:49] And that's currently distributed to a couple thousand leaders every year.
[00:07:53] And that's a pay for report.
[00:07:54] You can get it t3trends.com.
[00:07:56] And then we have a free report, which is the real estate all men act.
[00:07:59] And it's a comprehensive evaluation and list of top 1000 brokerages, all the big, all
[00:08:06] of the MLS's, all the associations, the top 200 leaders in the industry, which we do a
[00:08:11] very diligent ranking exercise every year to rank the top 200 leaders.
[00:08:15] All the large technology companies, just about 200 technology companies in the industry.
[00:08:19] We also categorize as these are the top companies in each product category.
[00:08:24] All that is at real estate all men act.com.
[00:08:27] And again, we also publish a book that goes as a chunky 500 page all men act type book
[00:08:32] every year.
[00:08:33] So that's, we produce intelligence for the industry, but we also do tons and tons of projects
[00:08:39] and consulting.
[00:08:41] And you know, there, and you have four former CEOs that work within the company and a
[00:08:45] whole team of people that came out of the industry that are here to give extra horsepower
[00:08:49] to a broker and MLS and association of big team.
[00:08:54] You're like, hey, I need some, I'm going to make some changes in my business.
[00:08:57] So we're, we're the right people to talk to you for doing that.
[00:09:00] Yeah, thanks for that.
[00:09:01] And also too, you have a new report that is out called the opportunity report.
[00:09:06] And I believe this is in conjunction with homes.com.
[00:09:09] And it is really a good sample of what you guys do in the industry.
[00:09:14] And people can actually download this report.
[00:09:16] You should.
[00:09:17] It is jam full of great information.
[00:09:20] I was reading through it this morning.
[00:09:21] It's the opportunity report.com will have a link to that in the show notes.
[00:09:25] We'll be talking about that today, that specific report.
[00:09:28] And also a T360 has a news arm of their company.
[00:09:32] So if you're somebody who likes to read real estate brokerage news, real estate news.com should
[00:09:38] be added to your watch list.
[00:09:40] They're fantastic.
[00:09:41] Sign up for their email list, but make, you know, bookmark that because there aren't
[00:09:46] a lot of great real estate news sites online and real estate news is newer.
[00:09:51] And they are nipping at the heels of some of the big boys out there.
[00:09:55] So check them out.
[00:09:56] And they have really great articles of what Jack was telling me earlier, because I wasn't
[00:10:00] as familiar.
[00:10:01] What I love is they do a summary at the beginning of each of each article, which is really,
[00:10:05] it's like too long didn't read kind of stereo.
[00:10:07] You could just go right to it.
[00:10:09] So for all you guys people, you'll love it.
[00:10:11] That news arm, they send one email a day with the news stories that we think real estate
[00:10:15] professionals should pay attention to.
[00:10:18] Every article has a bullet summary at the beginning that you can digest in probably 10 seconds.
[00:10:23] So that you know, and if you want to read the article, it's all there, but there's always
[00:10:25] a summary.
[00:10:27] And there's, it's not a pay to play type of organization.
[00:10:30] It is something where, you know, we only write about what we think industry professionals
[00:10:34] need to hear.
[00:10:35] So and, and you can, the daily emails free, you can sign up for a subscription to get access
[00:10:38] to all of the articles in the additional research we published there.
[00:10:42] That's real estate news.com and then also again, the opportunity report.com is where you
[00:10:47] can download that report.
[00:10:48] And just for everyone out there who's still, you know, getting acclimated now to T 360,
[00:10:52] this might be the first time you're aware of them.
[00:10:54] I will tell you, from a brokerage perspective, we look at like two reports a year.
[00:10:58] One is whatever T 360 is saying we're going to read it and the Zillow report every year,
[00:11:03] just on the data, they collect.
[00:11:05] Those are the two big ones.
[00:11:06] And, you know, this is, this is really so much fun to talk to you because right now,
[00:11:11] the industry is in flux a bit or at least going through change or has been going, has been
[00:11:16] going through change and people are agents are sort of interested to know what the analysts
[00:11:23] and the consultants think is the future of real estate brokerage and agents themselves.
[00:11:29] So I asked our audience to come up with some questions for you and funny enough, I think
[00:11:35] most of them are actually talked about in the opportunity report again, opportunity report.
[00:11:40] The opportunity report.com again, link to that in the show notes.
[00:11:45] But can we just dive right into some topics and have you give us a take?
[00:11:48] I want to give a little bit of background just to know where the information comes from
[00:11:51] because this is, this is, it'd be very easy to hear this and go like,
[00:11:56] these guys just make this up, you know, where did this come from?
[00:11:59] So 10 years ago, NAR paid our firm to do a risk assessment of the industry.
[00:12:05] And in that, we had our founder and my partners, DeFan, flew and visited in person
[00:12:10] with 50 leaders in the industry in their offices, confidential interviews.
[00:12:14] We also did surveys and we did some focus group work and we compiled it all into a report,
[00:12:20] which is called the danger report, which we released in 2015.
[00:12:24] So that report, overviewed all of the risks that we thought the industry was facing at that time.
[00:12:31] The opportunity report is really an update to that danger report, but from a different perspective.
[00:12:36] And this time, the work was sponsored via homes.com.
[00:12:39] And we follow the same process.
[00:12:42] We interviewed, we picked 50 of the leaders of large or important organizations in the industry
[00:12:46] from across the spectrum, brokerage, franchise, MLS association, some other consultants,
[00:12:51] some other people that do work in the industry, you know, leadership level media organizations
[00:12:57] and said, what do we think the big opportunities are for real estate professionals right now?
[00:13:02] And so a lot of what I'll say is, we talk to a ton of really smart people.
[00:13:07] It isn't all our original thoughts.
[00:13:08] We synthesized it into a single document and there's some different perspectives offered
[00:13:13] in the document, but they all highlight these are the things that we think are important to pay
[00:13:19] attention to right now.
[00:13:21] Now, the danger report, we did do an analysis of the danger report that we wrote 10 years ago
[00:13:24] about all those risks.
[00:13:26] And in front of the opportunity reports, kind of fun.
[00:13:28] We gave the danger report to chat GPT and said evaluate our report.
[00:13:33] How well we did.
[00:13:34] Yeah, it was the score.
[00:13:35] How did we do?
[00:13:36] And there were, you know, again, about, you know, 25, 30 different dangers all broken out by
[00:13:44] industry segment.
[00:13:45] And overall, it gave that report an 83% score of accuracy.
[00:13:50] And it went one, you know, piece by piece by piece.
[00:13:53] And there were many things in there like regulatory impact on the industry.
[00:13:57] 100%.
[00:13:57] That's absolutely happened.
[00:13:59] The industry has had regulatory impact, right?
[00:14:02] The growth and dominance of teams in, you know, growth of sales volume,
[00:14:07] commission compression, all of these changes that we all know have happened.
[00:14:11] It rated all of those.
[00:14:12] And so what I would say to the listener is that if you're like, well, why should I read this report?
[00:14:18] Well, the same organization that produced the danger report 10 years ago,
[00:14:21] had 83% accuracy has produced another report with the same methodology.
[00:14:25] It's likely to have a similar degree of accuracy.
[00:14:28] So if you knew you could get a document, it was 83% accurate about what's going to happen 10 years
[00:14:33] in the future, I would recommend you read it.
[00:14:36] Well, I would, I wouldn't even say how much would you pay for something like that, right?
[00:14:41] And the fact that you don't have to pay for this particular report and other reports T360
[00:14:46] does is of course behind a paywall because, you know, they're a company they need to make profit.
[00:14:51] But this is something that everyone should read about.
[00:14:54] And again, even if half of it is true, which of course the data would maybe suggest that more
[00:14:59] than half of it should be true.
[00:15:01] But even if half of it's true, there's lots of good takeaways in here.
[00:15:04] And just to sort of talk about this report a little,
[00:15:08] high level, what were some of the trends that you saw starting to emerge as you were working
[00:15:13] this report?
[00:15:14] So there's a through line in the whole report that I talk about because you go through it and you go,
[00:15:19] what's the, what is the, what's the big theme?
[00:15:21] What's the big message?
[00:15:22] And the big message is really about value.
[00:15:25] It is about the consumer valuing the agent and how that happens now because we've got a major shift
[00:15:33] in that relationship.
[00:15:35] It's about how the real estate professional values the MLS, their local, their state,
[00:15:41] and the National Association. And we're in a time DJ where there's been some,
[00:15:47] there's been some loss of trust in institutions.
[00:15:50] And not just in our industry, I think this is broadly,
[00:15:53] broadly true in North America and in the US.
[00:15:56] As we've said, we don't think these institutions have done their job.
[00:16:00] And that's part of what we listen.
[00:16:01] We interviewed these 50 leaders and they said, look,
[00:16:04] some of the institutions are industry have not done the job they need to be for us.
[00:16:07] And so the way you rebuild, the way you move forward with that and an opportunistic framework is
[00:16:14] you work on value.
[00:16:16] And that, and as an agent practitioner or as a broker, we need to demonstrate our value to the consumer.
[00:16:24] Which by the way, the good news is, I think the industry has tons of value.
[00:16:28] You know, I've been a practitioner, I've sold real estate myself, I had agents that work for us
[00:16:31] and the franchises that I had ownership in and the local broker that you have here in Austin.
[00:16:36] I've spent a lot of time, you know, I've spent a lot of time up close and personal.
[00:16:42] And there's tremendous value that the industry has.
[00:16:45] We're just not very good about talking about it.
[00:16:48] We're not very good about explaining it.
[00:16:50] We're not very good about packaging and positioning it.
[00:16:52] I think we do a pretty good job on the listing side.
[00:16:56] I think that's where listing agents, generally probably anyone of your listeners,
[00:16:58] we could we could get them on and say, give us your listing presentation.
[00:17:01] Yeah, listing vision they've done it for a while.
[00:17:03] They probably do a pretty good job.
[00:17:04] Yeah.
[00:17:05] We're going to bring somebody on that works with buyers.
[00:17:08] And it's going to be a little spotty because they've not been asked to discuss,
[00:17:14] present and help people understand their value at the level that they are now.
[00:17:21] And I think that's the big transition we're going to.
[00:17:23] Is that?
[00:17:23] And having the buyer sign off on the commission agreement.
[00:17:28] Like having that, you know, I think it could be pretty well easily argued that
[00:17:34] buyers were always paying commissions.
[00:17:36] In some form or another, they just weren't made necessarily seeing.
[00:17:39] They weren't writing the check.
[00:17:40] They weren't seeing the actual money flow from their big account out to a particular commission.
[00:17:45] But now they now they do.
[00:17:46] So you're right.
[00:17:47] Those conversations are just much different.
[00:17:50] Yeah, for sure.
[00:17:51] But that's the through line in the report.
[00:17:53] And so I think we're set up.
[00:17:54] I mean, we can dive in any.
[00:17:56] There's particular areas, but but as many of the areas are going to come back to
[00:18:00] how is the industry demonstrating value either the consumer, the practitioner.
[00:18:05] And that's the big thing.
[00:18:06] Well, my first question is about the NAR settlement.
[00:18:11] And in particular, within the industry,
[00:18:14] and the agent side and on the brokerage side, it's all we've really heard about for the last,
[00:18:20] you know, year and a half or so.
[00:18:21] Sure.
[00:18:22] However, and we see lots of news articles being written for the public about this.
[00:18:26] Of course, it's made lots of news.
[00:18:28] How aware is the public about what's going on with NAR and is that affecting their
[00:18:36] their perception of the value of a real estate agent?
[00:18:40] So both less than we think because, you know, this is one of those problems where we're in the
[00:18:48] industry. And so we think about it all the time.
[00:18:50] And so our experience is very, very different from the average consumer.
[00:18:54] The average consumer, they engage with their industry once every 10 to 10.
[00:18:59] It's actually now an average of every 12 years.
[00:19:01] It's pretty frequent.
[00:19:03] It's a major life of it when they do though.
[00:19:05] So it's important, but they're not as engaged with the day to day.
[00:19:08] And so unless you're talking to people that are, you know, really in the process,
[00:19:11] I mean, people in the process are paying attention to news about the process.
[00:19:15] They're paying attention to real estate.
[00:19:17] And we've definitely had, it's come up in our surveys and in other surveys that we're aware of,
[00:19:21] like, you know, a thousand of us has done some great survey work in the consumer space.
[00:19:24] And we talk to them all the time.
[00:19:26] Tom Ferry runs a coaching organization.
[00:19:28] They've done some survey work.
[00:19:30] And it's absolutely coming up in listing appointments and, you know, people are saying
[00:19:33] what they're seeing in the media.
[00:19:36] But for a lot of the consumer public, if they're not engaged in a real estate process,
[00:19:40] they're probably not giving a lot of attention.
[00:19:42] Much like, you know, if there's something I'm not engaged in in my day to day life,
[00:19:46] you know, I may have peripheral awareness or no awareness of it.
[00:19:50] So, sort of depends on where that consumer is in their real estate life cycle, you know,
[00:19:56] and if they're more actively engaged and more likely they are paying attention to news about real estate.
[00:20:01] And it is, we're hearing regular reports and then I'm on, I'm on all Facebook groups,
[00:20:05] all your listeners are on.
[00:20:06] So I see that.
[00:20:07] So I've seen agents say, hey, this is coming up.
[00:20:09] I'm hearing this.
[00:20:10] Now we did some of our own surveys after, you know, after the August 17th,
[00:20:15] some of that has fed into our trends report, which we're releasing in two weeks here.
[00:20:19] And that report and the survey work we did indicated that there's a significant portion
[00:20:27] of agents who work on the by side where it's about 40% where it's impacted their ability to
[00:20:33] sign by our clients, meaning they had to do some, they had to do some explaining.
[00:20:37] It's like, hey, this isn't as easy as it used to be to just, you know, get the car and go with
[00:20:41] the client.
[00:20:42] And so it is that now, I think that's going to go down.
[00:20:45] I think in a year for now, this will be old news.
[00:20:48] Everybody will have understood.
[00:20:49] Here's how to talk.
[00:20:50] So I'd say they'll have perfected the buyer pitch.
[00:20:53] They don't know.
[00:20:54] Yeah, I know what my value is as a buyer's agent.
[00:20:56] I know what things like here's good examples of how I create value.
[00:21:00] Here's clients that I work with and what I did for them, you know, people are going to get their,
[00:21:03] they're going to get their explanation really well home.
[00:21:08] And if they don't, they're going to get out.
[00:21:09] You know, they're going to, if you can't explain what you're doing in a way that, where the
[00:21:13] consumer understands it and is going to sign up for it on front end, then you're not,
[00:21:18] then that's part of the job you can't do.
[00:21:19] And that's an important part of the job now and in the future.
[00:21:23] So another question about agents themselves.
[00:21:26] And I want to specifically talk about dual career versus single career only because
[00:21:32] we have a holding company here in Illinois that we run, which is for agents who aren't
[00:21:36] actively practicing, but when they keep their license active, again, they're not working in
[00:21:40] the industry at the time.
[00:21:41] At the beginning of the year, we had, we've had it for about 10 years or so.
[00:21:45] We had 800 agents in this holding company.
[00:21:47] This is in Illinois.
[00:21:48] We can kind of hold licenses all throughout the state.
[00:21:51] And by the end of this year, we'll be close to 1300 agents.
[00:21:55] So we were seeing a bit of a, a huge increase in people leaving the industry,
[00:22:00] which I suspect are mostly dual career agents.
[00:22:02] But I'm curious to see what data you guys have or what trends you see about the role of the
[00:22:09] dual career agent moving forward versus single career.
[00:22:12] Yeah, this has been, this is an industry that has a lot of that.
[00:22:16] You know, it has a lot of people to do something else, but also do real estate.
[00:22:21] And, you know, policeman, fireman, teachers, you know, there's many,
[00:22:25] there's many people that have a singular job that they've done for a long time.
[00:22:31] And then they add real estate to the mix.
[00:22:33] And it's an additional income for them.
[00:22:34] So what I will say is that I don't think the, the dual career person or the person that uses
[00:22:42] real estate as an additional income stream is going to necessarily go away.
[00:22:47] And as a matter of fact, there's, there's a good case for it.
[00:22:49] The, the people I wrote an article for those days last fall.
[00:22:52] And that article, you know, I said, the people that are likely to really struggle
[00:22:57] are the single career real estate people who really quite, they haven't quite established their
[00:23:02] career. Like they're, they're doing, you know, three, four or five transactions a year.
[00:23:08] And with all, and they really do like real estate pays their mortgage and their light bill.
[00:23:13] And they're, they're very dependent on it.
[00:23:14] And, you know, those are the folks that are most I think.
[00:23:17] And at the time, my, what the article's written for brokers is, look, brokers,
[00:23:20] this is who you need to help right now is to make sure if you've got talented people,
[00:23:24] they need that extra step in their career.
[00:23:26] So where they can really make this a full time, where real estate is their full time profession.
[00:23:30] Because of the market and these changes, they're going to need some extra support right now.
[00:23:34] But I think the dual career folks are fine with the caveat that, you know, if they're
[00:23:38] referral only status, that's a whole different thing.
[00:23:40] Right.
[00:23:41] If you're actually practicing real estate, you of course have to be at that level of professional service.
[00:23:47] You're going to have to be able to represent talk about your value.
[00:23:50] You're going to have to do all those things are now.
[00:23:52] It doesn't matter if you're full time or part time.
[00:23:55] You have to be as professional as possible.
[00:23:56] And there's good, you know, this industry loves to beat up on people they're part time in history.
[00:24:01] It's they love it.
[00:24:03] We love it.
[00:24:03] But actually when you dig in, it's not the complaint is not, hey, this person is a part-time
[00:24:09] agent.
[00:24:10] The complaint is actually, they're not professional.
[00:24:13] They don't do a good job.
[00:24:15] They don't communicate with their client or with the cooperating broker.
[00:24:18] They don't, you know, like that kind of thing.
[00:24:20] That's actually the root of that complaint.
[00:24:22] It's not about the part-time status.
[00:24:23] And by the way, I think there's some for some consumers, the agent who is already made their
[00:24:30] money and is retired.
[00:24:32] This is extra money for them and they just do it to serve their community.
[00:24:36] It's actually a great agent to work with because it's no pressure.
[00:24:39] Because they're saying, hey, I don't need this, I don't need this deal to pay my light bill.
[00:24:43] I'm doing this because I want to take care of you and your family.
[00:24:47] And I use it to make a little extra money, but it's not the only money that I make, right?
[00:24:51] So there's a case to be named where that dual career agent can be of better service.
[00:24:56] With the caveat that they have to be at above a certain level professionalism.
[00:25:01] And I also agree with some of the thinking, and I think our firm is going to do some of the
[00:25:06] thinking that you need to be doing a certain number of transactions here just to keep your skills up,
[00:25:11] right?
[00:25:11] Just to know what's happening in the market.
[00:25:14] You know, you can't check out.
[00:25:16] You've got to be plugged in enough to do that.
[00:25:19] If you got a good broker, you got a good coach, you've got to make sure you're doing that.
[00:25:23] And then absolutely.
[00:25:24] But that's kind of what I'd say overall.
[00:25:27] As far as numbers, we are seeing renewal numbers.
[00:25:31] We're in renewal, as we're recording this podcast.
[00:25:33] We're in the renewal period for a lot of people's
[00:25:36] memberships in their associations.
[00:25:39] And the early take we have on it is that their renewal numbers will be down.
[00:25:44] And I've talked to some very large organizations that are sharing numbers
[00:25:48] a little preliminarily with us.
[00:25:51] And it does appear that people are getting out.
[00:25:53] Now, I don't know if they're necessarily the real career people or that single career person
[00:25:57] who's not an establishment.
[00:26:01] But we'll know, we'll probably know in February, where we've shaken out too.
[00:26:08] And it's fine.
[00:26:09] You know, it's just a natural.
[00:26:10] We're going through a natural cycle.
[00:26:12] You know, this is a tough time to be in the industry.
[00:26:14] And if you're not committed to it or you have other ways to make a money that are easier for you,
[00:26:19] then it makes sense.
[00:26:20] People will do other stuff.
[00:26:21] And they should do other stuff to take care of their families.
[00:26:23] But the career people are in it.
[00:26:25] You know, the lifelong professionals,
[00:26:27] they've seen storms before they weathered them before.
[00:26:31] And they're actually going to end up being the beneficiaries of all this change.
[00:26:35] Yeah, because they'll pick up market share from some of the people that leave the industry.
[00:26:39] And that's what's been super interesting to me.
[00:26:42] I interview top 1% agents across the country on the show.
[00:26:45] And none of them have really expressed a tremendous concern,
[00:26:49] other than just the overall health of the industry is obviously a consideration.
[00:26:53] But for their own personal production, they're not worried.
[00:26:55] And I think, well, that's a healthy side.
[00:26:57] If the top agents are going, hey, things are okay.
[00:27:00] Then and a lot of the top agents, when the buyer compensation, the agency agreement,
[00:27:06] you know, sort of went into effect, they were like, oh, I already do this.
[00:27:09] Or this is an easy pivot for me.
[00:27:11] I, you know, it's not a big deal.
[00:27:12] And so that was really encouraging to talk to these top agents who are like, nah, not a big deal.
[00:27:17] Yeah, and I think that's, again, I think a year from now, this will be, this will be old,
[00:27:23] old discussion, all the pros have figured it out.
[00:27:27] And then it's just now it's just a training issue for the new people to come in and say,
[00:27:30] here's how we do it.
[00:27:31] And, you know, it's just be the way we do business.
[00:27:33] So, so again, I think we're going to look at it and say, well,
[00:27:37] and I do think it will improve has the opportunity to improve the relationship we have
[00:27:42] with consumer, which is one of the, one of the items in the report is like, this is where
[00:27:45] you need to elevate our description of the services and help consumers understand them.
[00:27:50] Because right now, we're getting run down on the media.
[00:27:52] We're getting run down, you know, we are being portrayed as an industry that does not provide
[00:27:58] value when I know truth is on our side that we do provide a lot of value.
[00:28:03] We just have to get better about talking about it.
[00:28:05] We have to, we have to show up and really do do a great job of that.
[00:28:09] And that is the opportunity right now is elevating the professional,
[00:28:13] elevating the services that we provide, being better at explaining it all to the consumer,
[00:28:18] getting our own media stories, getting our own narratives out of the media about what we do
[00:28:23] as a profession. And that's the route out.
[00:28:26] But I don't see another, there's not another better way.
[00:28:29] It's like we need to, we need to elevate the profession itself.
[00:28:33] Yeah, I always think to it's sort of like the shift from advertising to providing value.
[00:28:40] A lot of agents love to advertise, right?
[00:28:43] They just listed, just sold, you know, look at how much production I'm doing.
[00:28:46] And again, I'm not here to denigrate any of that.
[00:28:49] That's great.
[00:28:50] And this idea of providing true value is what your customers really want is,
[00:28:56] what should they do with their homes right now?
[00:28:57] Should they think about refinancing?
[00:28:59] Should they think about moving?
[00:29:00] What neighborhood are they looking to next?
[00:29:02] What, you know, all of the important life event stuff is where agents can really step in
[00:29:06] in between the sales while they're in that 12-year holding period at that home
[00:29:11] and continue to somehow provide value to that homeowner throughout that lifespan.
[00:29:15] So that when they are ready to make that next transition, of course,
[00:29:18] that agent would be first of mind.
[00:29:19] But what I will say is, it's that road of providing value for like say a 12-year period after somebody,
[00:29:26] you know, buys a home.
[00:29:27] Is not a crowded road.
[00:29:30] So if you are an agent that, you know, whether it's your transaction or not,
[00:29:35] maybe it wasn't your purchase, but you want to develop a relationship with that homeowner,
[00:29:40] I can almost assure you that person's agent will probably not be providing a tremendous
[00:29:44] amount of that.
[00:29:45] Now, hopefully they will.
[00:29:46] But in most cases, I think, you know, people get forgotten about and there's a lot of opportunity
[00:29:50] to step in and say, hey, I want to start, you know, telling you about things that you care about,
[00:29:54] you know, during that time.
[00:29:56] There's a reason this industry spends billions of dollars to talk to consumers that don't have an
[00:30:01] agent.
[00:30:02] And it's because that they those consumers were probably abandoned or forgotten about or their agent
[00:30:08] got out of the business.
[00:30:09] And so that's that is and you don't have to spend billions of dollars to do that.
[00:30:13] You could just do it.
[00:30:15] Right.
[00:30:15] So again, I know we've got, you know, some of this is going to be preaching to the choir.
[00:30:18] You have some top agents.
[00:30:19] Listen to this.
[00:30:20] The the act of staying in touch with your community and with people in your life as a as a friend,
[00:30:29] but also as a real estate professional is the lifelong skill that of this industry.
[00:30:36] And most people don't go the distance.
[00:30:38] And you're correct.
[00:30:38] It's not a crowded road of staying in touch with those consumers.
[00:30:42] And you know, a direct male campaign is not enough, you know, you need to do,
[00:30:46] you need to do a little bit more.
[00:30:48] And then when it's time to transact, that's when you go high stakes in terms of,
[00:30:52] here's my value proposition, here's what I do, here's how I'm going to save you money,
[00:30:55] help you get the home you want, help you get from where you are today, where you want to be,
[00:31:00] and becoming an expert at that conversation with lots of specific examples so that you can
[00:31:06] help your client understand it.
[00:31:08] You know, that's the skill.
[00:31:10] That's the skill.
[00:31:11] You know, I want to switch to some topics that are of interest to every one of our agents for
[00:31:16] sure, which is commissions.
[00:31:18] So let's talk about the our commissions increasing, decreasing, is there a compression going on?
[00:31:23] Where do you see that headed?
[00:31:25] And we'll start with, still we'll start there.
[00:31:26] So tell us what you think is going to happen to commissions.
[00:31:29] In the in the opportunity report, we did talk about that, but it wasn't a focus of the report.
[00:31:34] It wasn't a focus of like, hey, we're surveying the top leaders industry,
[00:31:37] find out where commissions were and the report was done over the summer.
[00:31:40] So some of it was before the settlement changes.
[00:31:42] Subsequent to the report, we did run a survey and did some survey work to find out what people
[00:31:49] were seeing.
[00:31:50] And it's really interesting DJ.
[00:31:53] We saw we have seen that.
[00:31:55] There there absolutely are some agents experiencing commission compression where they're
[00:32:00] they're they're not, you know, they're they're seeing their commission pressurized.
[00:32:04] But on the flip side, we're also seeing agents on the buy side, they're saying they're making more money now.
[00:32:10] But because because and here's the key point, they're no longer relying on the I want the listing agent.
[00:32:16] Right.
[00:32:17] So they're they are they are instead saying I'm going to stand in my own two feet and explain my value
[00:32:23] proposition and sign an agreement of what, you know, what my time value of money is.
[00:32:28] And and then getting that.
[00:32:30] And so and this was confirmed by spoke with Tom Ferry.
[00:32:32] I was in his office about a month ago.
[00:32:34] We did a we also did a podcast there.
[00:32:36] And and he's done some survey work with his coaching base.
[00:32:40] And and that was he was finding that that was consistent in the survey responses.
[00:32:44] There's a pretty healthy sized group of agents that are now actually they effectively given
[00:32:50] themselves a raise because they are now addressing their compensation on the front end,
[00:32:55] explaining their value, and they're getting it.
[00:32:57] And then they're going into the transaction and they're negotiating as part of the transaction.
[00:33:01] It's like, hey, I'm going to submit an offer.
[00:33:03] Here's the offer.
[00:33:04] Here's the you know, the closing costs we're asking for some which will be used to cover their,
[00:33:09] you know, their compensation.
[00:33:10] So so I think this is a.
[00:33:14] This is a choose your own adventure type of situation.
[00:33:16] You know, you can treat it as weather.
[00:33:18] You can say as the weather good or bad outside.
[00:33:21] Or you can decide how you want the weather to be for you in this instance.
[00:33:26] Or you can say, look, I'm I'm going to make sure that my values represented
[00:33:30] and because my time is valuable.
[00:33:31] And so that's that's the that's the shakeout.
[00:33:33] Now do I think overall overall that probably means because there's a lot of people
[00:33:37] that are going to struggle to negotiate their value.
[00:33:41] And so those that group will experience commission compression.
[00:33:45] They're not going to be able to they just won't be as good negotiating their value.
[00:33:49] And they probably won't make as much, which means they probably some segment of them will get out.
[00:33:54] And then the people that can't explain value will will take that barcode share.
[00:33:57] So so I'd say it all points in the same direction.
[00:34:00] And all points to developing that professional narrative and approach to the business
[00:34:05] and understanding your value.
[00:34:06] There's some great tools for explaining your value coming out right now.
[00:34:09] Like I'm a big fan of James Dwaygens and the work that they're doing over
[00:34:12] the days.
[00:34:14] R-A-Y-S-E.com.
[00:34:16] And they're building a tool that keeps track of everything you do for your clients.
[00:34:20] And pulls it out of your email, your calendar, your text messages.
[00:34:24] Oh, I love that.
[00:34:25] It's super cool.
[00:34:26] It pulls it out and puts it all in a report.
[00:34:28] And then it tells you, here's how many hours you still with a client in meetings.
[00:34:32] Here's how many how much time you spend driving around.
[00:34:34] Here's all that kind of stuff.
[00:34:35] And creates a really great summary.
[00:34:37] And then you can use that in your meetings and say,
[00:34:39] Hey, this is this is an aggregate report showing the amount of time.
[00:34:43] Because again, a thousand of them are really great surveyed with consumers.
[00:34:46] And they found that consumers think that the average consumer thinks that we spend about
[00:34:50] 15 hours on a transaction.
[00:34:52] When the reality is, it's closer to 80 to 85 hours for transactions.
[00:34:57] So the consumer's impression is wrong in terms of how much time and effort most agents
[00:35:02] put into a transaction.
[00:35:04] And this is where I say truth is on our side.
[00:35:06] You know, the amount of work, consumers value the work that's being done when they understand it.
[00:35:11] They have a miscalibration about how much time it actually takes to do a transaction.
[00:35:17] And that's not to say, of course, there's some transactions that are easier than others.
[00:35:20] But on average, it's a lot higher than the average consumer thinks.
[00:35:24] So those are things that, you know, that I would say the industry should use
[00:35:28] as tools like that and understanding like that to navigate more effectively.
[00:35:33] The other thing I'll give you, DJ, which your audience should know.
[00:35:36] And it's in the opportunity report.
[00:35:38] It's in our trends report is that the agents have more value than they think they do.
[00:35:47] And when you ask the consumer and you ask the consumer, hey, what's important about your agent?
[00:35:52] And the number one thing is not the cheapest deal.
[00:35:54] North American consumers are not cheap.
[00:35:57] We're not cheapest deal people for the most part.
[00:35:59] Now, there's always, we're always looking for a deal.
[00:36:01] But what we place above deal is service and trust.
[00:36:05] That's above.
[00:36:06] And in the survey work, 1000 watt is done, which has been fabulous.
[00:36:09] That's that leads.
[00:36:11] And so, you know, yes, there are always going to be people that are looking for how to do something
[00:36:15] cheaper, but they won't do it with something that they don't trust.
[00:36:20] Right? They want trust.
[00:36:21] They want knowledge.
[00:36:22] They want service.
[00:36:23] Right?
[00:36:23] If they can't get that at a lower price, they will pay a higher price.
[00:36:27] And the anecdote I use on stages, we're an economy and a people that we will pay more to have
[00:36:34] the food delivered than we will for the food itself.
[00:36:37] 100%.
[00:36:37] We value the service.
[00:36:39] We value the service.
[00:36:40] This is a very service focus.
[00:36:41] The North American consumer is very service focused and wants that.
[00:36:46] And that sounds like all of this.
[00:36:47] This is in the opportunity report.
[00:36:49] It's in our trends report.
[00:36:50] It's in what we've been studying for years.
[00:36:52] It's validated by survey work done by us and done by others.
[00:36:55] And what I say is like, this is some fundamental stuff that as a professional,
[00:37:00] you can operate with confidence from that and build your business around that.
[00:37:04] And if you do, you'll be successful.
[00:37:06] You know, that's all it is.
[00:37:08] Again, the opportunity report.com is where you go to read their most recent
[00:37:13] information and analysis of the industry.
[00:37:16] Now I want to talk about brokerage or splits for agents.
[00:37:20] Do we see a compression there?
[00:37:23] Do we see splits increasing, decreasing?
[00:37:25] You know, where do you see trends headed there?
[00:37:27] You know what's interesting?
[00:37:28] So we did this.
[00:37:28] This is not opportunity report.
[00:37:30] This is out of our research work in Real Estate, Almanac.
[00:37:33] And we wrote about it in a trend report two years ago.
[00:37:39] Actually, no, it's an industry's trend report we haven't
[00:37:41] knew. We expanded this one.
[00:37:43] So we looked at what are the broker condition models
[00:37:47] that are growing the most right now?
[00:37:50] What are the ones that are really gaining?
[00:37:52] And if you look, we looked at the top 100 brokerages in the industry
[00:37:57] and looked at the composition of those brokerages.
[00:37:59] And what we're seeing is that all commission models but one are growing in terms of
[00:38:07] demographically growing.
[00:38:09] The traditional business model where you have a graduated
[00:38:12] commit, graduated commission split is generally declining.
[00:38:16] It isn't to say that it's bad.
[00:38:18] This is not a good bad conversation.
[00:38:19] It's just there's more companies that are doing more sales volume than
[00:38:23] removing another models.
[00:38:24] The most, the model that has grown the most over the last five years is a
[00:38:31] Capped Commission model, something where there's a cap above
[00:38:36] beyond the cap where you pay just a transaction fee or something like that.
[00:38:39] And that represents that's what I would refer to as the
[00:38:42] Kelley's model.
[00:38:43] Like that, that model is the one that in the top 100 brokerages
[00:38:48] has grown the most and substantially the most in the last few years.
[00:38:51] But transaction unit, your transaction fee models,
[00:38:54] those have grown.
[00:38:55] And also the fourth model that we talk about, which is really the team or
[00:39:00] business generation model where you have teams who are
[00:39:02] generating business for their agents.
[00:39:04] Very profitable model for a broker or a team to operate on.
[00:39:07] Very challenging to operate.
[00:39:08] You need some skills to operate it.
[00:39:10] But that one is also growing.
[00:39:11] So that's roughly the landscape.
[00:39:14] I don't know what that means in terms of commission splits
[00:39:19] for individual agents that are listening to this podcast.
[00:39:21] That's just overall, we look at the top 100 brokerages
[00:39:23] we're finding that there are more brokers doing more sales volume
[00:39:26] and on a growth perspective.
[00:39:28] They're in some kind of capped model.
[00:39:31] But what I will tell you is that
[00:39:35] agents for the most part have already squeezed all the value out of most brokerages.
[00:39:39] Most brokers, they're marked most of them.
[00:39:42] We did another study with a account tag, which is an accounting provider.
[00:39:45] Again, looked at about 100 brokerages.
[00:39:47] That's not the top 100, but 100 brokerage sampled out of their accounting set.
[00:39:51] And about 40% of them were unprofitable.
[00:39:54] And 60% that were the big chunk of that was below 4% profitability.
[00:40:00] So fairly low profitability.
[00:40:02] If you look at the landscape,
[00:40:05] your broker doesn't have more money to get.
[00:40:07] You've probably already got most of it.
[00:40:10] Where we center on is what's most important is not how much money you give your brokerage.
[00:40:16] That is a dumb, boring, uninteresting conversation.
[00:40:19] Because the real thing is what do you need in order to run your business?
[00:40:25] Right.
[00:40:25] And how can you source that?
[00:40:27] And there are many brokers that are very effective at providing services and support
[00:40:32] that enable an agent to do another 5 or 6, 7 transactions a year.
[00:40:37] Because they don't have to do the administrative work.
[00:40:40] They don't have to do the transaction work.
[00:40:42] They don't have to do the marketing work.
[00:40:44] And they can focus on the high value part, which is meeting work with clients.
[00:40:48] And so that's what I tell people, say,
[00:40:50] well, I just want to go and go.
[00:40:52] If you're an agent that wants to do every stupid little thing in your business,
[00:40:57] if you want to upload stuff in the MLS, you want to manage your own transactions.
[00:41:00] If you want to do all of that,
[00:41:01] go to a place that charges your low transaction fee and covers your ENO.
[00:41:05] Fine, do it that way.
[00:41:07] Are you going to make the most amount of money that way?
[00:41:09] I think there's a real question.
[00:41:13] Myself personally, I've had a license to transact it.
[00:41:16] I don't want to do all that stuff.
[00:41:18] And I would try to broker that offer me some staffing and some support.
[00:41:22] And because what I want to do is I want to meet with prospective clients.
[00:41:24] I'm going to go to lunch, go to dinner,
[00:41:26] I want to have a full calendar of prospective client meetings.
[00:41:29] And I want to hand all that work off to somebody.
[00:41:32] And so I find a broker that supports me in that kind of way.
[00:41:35] So I think people get focused on the wrong thing.
[00:41:38] They're like, oh, I get a better one.
[00:41:39] And I'll tell you, we've interviewed tons of brokers,
[00:41:42] tons of agents.
[00:41:44] People don't leave the brokerage that they're with because of a commission issue.
[00:41:50] Correct.
[00:41:50] They leave the brokerage because of something else.
[00:41:53] Service or support.
[00:41:54] 
[00:41:55] Somebody ticked them off.
[00:41:56] Somebody did something they didn't like.
[00:41:58] Their broker didn't show up for them in a critical moment.
[00:42:00] Right.
[00:42:01] That's why they leave and then they blame it on them.
[00:42:04] They offer me a better deal.
[00:42:05] No, no, no.
[00:42:06] It's the agent is no different from the consumer in North America.
[00:42:10] The agent is willing to pay for value.
[00:42:12] That's why we're seeing growth of things like, you know, we see place,
[00:42:15] which is, you know, Ben Kinney's outfit that it provides additional services and support for people.
[00:42:20] It's where we see companies like Sines or we see companies that provide.
[00:42:23] You know, that's that was really people like to say, well, the growth story of
[00:42:26] Compass was all about they just bottle these agents.
[00:42:28] And there's a part of that that's true.
[00:42:29] But the other part of that that's true is they offered them a lot of services and support.
[00:42:34] And they said, look, you don't have to have a marketing ad full-time marketing adman
[00:42:38] because we'll do it.
[00:42:39] Or our technology platform plus our admance staff will do it.
[00:42:41] So that so people are willing to pay for that.
[00:42:44] And in Quizz Dilly, one of the air, one of the segments that has been the most resilient
[00:42:48] has been the high end segment.
[00:42:50] The Sotheby's has been really on a tear.
[00:42:53] The last few years of Reed Art, Almanac reports you'll see they've been a growth gainer.
[00:42:58] And the high end and what does high end brokerages do?
[00:43:02] They provide a lot of services to their agents.
[00:43:04] They provide a lot of support and they've been able to hold their margins better
[00:43:09] because of that.
[00:43:11] Because the agent says, this is really like I want to spend time with high net worth clients,
[00:43:15] which take a lot of time.
[00:43:17] They're more intense client.
[00:43:20] So that's what I'd say is this commission thing, don't get distracted,
[00:43:25] go get the support and service you need in order to run your business and pay for it.
[00:43:29] Because you can pay for it one way or another.
[00:43:31] And here are the most expensive way to pay for it in most cases.
[00:43:34] Yeah, what I'm hearing from a brokerage or a team perspective who's looking to recruit members
[00:43:40] look for solutions to whatever that agent you're trying to recruit's business is,
[00:43:46] whatever problems that business is experiencing.
[00:43:49] And it might be commission split, but it's probably more than that.
[00:43:52] Because if it was just commission split, everyone would be at a transaction-based firm.
[00:43:57] They'd all be paying $400 a transaction and we'd all go on our merry way.
[00:44:01] And we find that in most cases, top producers aren't at those firms because oftentimes the
[00:44:07] services are not as prevalent.
[00:44:11] The service, the brand, the whole the value package.
[00:44:14] If conversation starts with what commissions split, you actually have the wrong conversation.
[00:44:20] You start with the value, understand the value, how does it help you?
[00:44:23] I always tell brokers, you shouldn't be measuring things.
[00:44:26] The way you should be measuring things is how many successful agents are you creating in your brokerage?
[00:44:31] Who's getting to go on vacations?
[00:44:34] Who's sending their kids to nice schools that they want to send their kids to?
[00:44:39] Who's able to fulfill their retirement ambitions?
[00:44:43] The other word, that's what we should be measuring.
[00:44:46] Not that commission, people go straight to the commission split and you're measuring the wrong thing.
[00:44:50] That's the dumb thing to measure.
[00:44:51] Let's measure outcomes.
[00:44:52] Let's look at lives.
[00:44:54] And I'd say the same to the agent, you need to look at your life.
[00:44:56] Does the broker to risk or you and the way you do business?
[00:45:01] That's the most important thing.
[00:45:04] Absolutely agree.
[00:45:05] I want to circle back to value because our listeners are individual practitioners or team leads or
[00:45:11] team members.
[00:45:13] broker-johners as well, we're all thinking about how do we keep the train rolling while
[00:45:18] obviously listings are down right now.
[00:45:21] It's a little bit trickier to work with buyers at present day.
[00:45:25] Obviously rates aren't exactly where anyone would prefer them to be in relation to
[00:45:30] three years ago.
[00:45:32] It's a tricky time.
[00:45:34] And so if you were out there practicing today and you were thinking about your 2025 business plan,
[00:45:40] and I know you're going to say lots to do with value, but I'm curious if there's specific,
[00:45:45] anything specific that you'd say I would focus on this?
[00:45:48] Yeah, so I was in broker should be a great financial crisis and we had to get real creative.
[00:45:52] Right?
[00:45:53] Because we had this we had a similar problem.
[00:45:55] We had listings that were sitting for longer and longer and we had buyers that couldn't
[00:46:01] work the bottom because of that.
[00:46:02] So it was a similar problem.
[00:46:04] So what we wanted to do is first of all know that people need to sell real estate.
[00:46:11] People need to buy real estate.
[00:46:13] There's fundamental stuff that's happening that means they need to buy it.
[00:46:16] And if you're just talking to your network and they don't need to buy or sell real estate right now,
[00:46:20] that means you need to add something into what you're doing to find the people that are and you
[00:46:25] may need to go into other territories.
[00:46:26] And then the discourse that we teach add to 360, there's four ways that agents make money.
[00:46:32] They make money via networking with their sphere.
[00:46:35] They make money via prospecting specific targeted opportunities.
[00:46:39] Expires, cancel withdrawals for sale by owners.
[00:46:41] People that tried to sell their homes two or three years ago.
[00:46:43] And that's a great if I was in business today, I'd pull a list to see,
[00:46:47] hey, we were people that tried to sell, we're not able to and go back to that list because things
[00:46:51] changed, life changes, lead generation, paying for leads and increase in opportunities.
[00:46:56] There's a lot of pay at close companies right now that are doing well.
[00:47:00] And last is marketing and brand and building a local becoming a local market expert really.
[00:47:06] Sucking up all of an opportunity because you're the best in a particular area.
[00:47:10] Those are the four fundamental ways.
[00:47:12] So I would say if the way you're doing isn't working right now, if you're an agent's
[00:47:15] primarily dependent on your sphere, which is most agents are dependent on their sphere,
[00:47:19] then that you have two options.
[00:47:21] You can grow your sphere by investing time in your community and networking,
[00:47:26] or you can pick one of these other ways.
[00:47:28] Usually the easiest way to pick in terms of things you have control over and you don't have to spend
[00:47:32] a much of money on is prospecting is to say, I'm going to go find a list of cancel,
[00:47:37] bizbo, expired withdrawn, people that tried to sell, we're not able to still need to and go,
[00:47:43] go generate listings.
[00:47:44] Right? And that's usually,
[00:47:46] internet lead generation is great if you find pay at close companies, there's a lot of them that are
[00:47:50] recommended. We keep a list that you can receive referral leads from.
[00:47:57] So I'd be looking at those and saying, if you have money to spend and you can spend it great,
[00:48:01] if you don't then do pay at close companies.
[00:48:04] And then marketing and brand right now is when you're actually establishing,
[00:48:07] you can use this time to establish yourself as an expert with an area because most people are
[00:48:10] getting out. That's a bit, I think that's where the long-term play. But by the way, if you're going
[00:48:15] to be in the business in five years, worth a while to say, look, I'm really going to focus on these
[00:48:20] neighborhoods or these areas and use this time to build my reputation there by taking listings there.
[00:48:26] The other piece is we have to get really good with the conversation with the seller.
[00:48:30] What's going to get buyers off the sidelines is well priced quality properties.
[00:48:34] Right? So those, and again, coming through the whole COVID nonsense, there's people in this
[00:48:38] industry have never had a price reduction conversation. I've never set the seller's expectations.
[00:48:42] We had a lot of those in our company during the GFC. So that is something we have to get really
[00:48:48] good at about saying, look, here's the reality of the buyers. The buyers in the market don't have a
[00:48:54] lot of money and they're being forced into high interest rates, which by the way, we're going to be
[00:48:57] persistent. Those high interest rates are not everybody's talking about like somebody's going to wave
[00:49:00] a magic one out. Some magic, a little 200 basis points down. That's not how this works people. That's
[00:49:08] the government keeps borrowing money into the bond market. Mortgage rates are going to stay high.
[00:49:12] That's what it is. That's not even, you could change the rate. The Fed could change the rate all day
[00:49:18] long, but if the investors can get a better rate by buying bonds from the government, why are they
[00:49:24] going to buy a mortgage backed thing? They're not. So the mortgages are going to be driven by the bond
[00:49:29] market. There's no magic tricks there. But you have to get really good about talking about that
[00:49:34] with your sellers and getting properties priced appropriately, which is going to be lower
[00:49:39] so that you can get some buyers off the sideline because that's when buyers are going to move.
[00:49:42] They're going to go, you know what? I can actually afford that now. It's a follow-up product.
[00:49:45] So we have to get good at those skills. That's what I would be doing in the market situation
[00:49:50] right now. There's a lot of tactics. There's a lot of little mechanics in there,
[00:49:54] but that's the kind of stuff I think about. I'm hearing a lot of pickup market share this year,
[00:49:59] over the next 12 months. This is a year to pick up market share and realize, too, that a lot of agents,
[00:50:06] the vast majority of agents are not single career agents. So there is a lot of opportunity, I think,
[00:50:14] to begin to demonstrate more value over a long-term period. And the good news, as we said earlier,
[00:50:21] is it's not a crowded road. There's lots of ways to do it. It's not just an email newsletter once
[00:50:25] a month. We should also mention that nobody wants to read your newsletter.
[00:50:29] Do something different. I always tell people, get weird. Do something that will stand out.
[00:50:33] You know, have a great holiday party that is memorable. You know, ran out of movie theater and
[00:50:38] invite everybody in your database. Do some weird stuff. You know, if you can't afford that,
[00:50:43] do it in your backyard with a screen. You know, whatever. Do something to connect with your
[00:50:47] community, connect with people that know you and get creative and do something different right now.
[00:50:53] And now it's a great time. The creative energy, I think, shows up the most in a market like this,
[00:50:58] where you just have to get creative, because you don't have much money to throw around.
[00:51:02] Right. I wanted to ask you to, do you think, so we have a good percentage of homeowners in this
[00:51:09] country that have a 3% or less current rate, or around 3 to 4%. Do we see that? Is that going to
[00:51:17] extend the amount of time that these homeowners are staying in these properties simply because
[00:51:23] they don't want to upgrade and have to pay a higher rate? I know I'm in that situation a bit
[00:51:28] where it's psychologically and just financially a difficult sort of thing to consider.
[00:51:35] How hamstrung are these homeowners who, you know, refied to the best possible rate they'll
[00:51:40] ever see in their lifetime? And then, you know, that... It's a great question. I think all of us that,
[00:51:46] like my wife and I own some investment rental properties, and I would sell them today,
[00:51:53] if I knew that if I market situation was different, we are in a house, fortunately,
[00:51:58] we bought a house right before the pandemic, and we're in one of those super, you know, sub-3%
[00:52:02] type of situations. And I don't think you can talk people out of their rate. Yeah, so I think
[00:52:09] that's a waste of time. I really do. But what I will say is what we should be finally attuned to
[00:52:15] are the life situations that cause people to want to move regardless of that. Because ultimately,
[00:52:21] people don't live and die by their work, like to check their right for the mortgage every day.
[00:52:25] It is about how close am I to where I work now? Do I now have... I've gotten two more kids
[00:52:31] since the beginning of the pandemic. I've got to put them somewhere. I don't like my living
[00:52:37] situation. So those are the things that will cost people to say, you know what, it's more
[00:52:43] important to me that I keep that household happy, that I'm happy and not miserable, and I'm in
[00:52:49] the place I need to be than it is what dollars a month or what the rate is. Everybody got into this
[00:52:54] whole competing on rates thing, and we're just going to have to get over that because we're not
[00:52:58] going to see low rates for a long time. So I think just being finally attuned to that, to what life
[00:53:02] is, and life puts pressure on people to buy or sell real estate, and that pressure will build up,
[00:53:07] it will build up, it will build up, it will build up, and finally one day they're going to go,
[00:53:10] I don't care that I got a great rate. I need two more bedrooms or I'm going to go crazy,
[00:53:15] right? Or I got a job and it's on the whole other end of the universe, and I'm tired of driving
[00:53:20] an hour or two in an hour from them, okay? We've got to move. Or my kid is now at this age,
[00:53:25] I want him in that school district, and I'm done, and that's the thing to be attuned to right now,
[00:53:29] because that's going to build up, because we're not, even if we could wave a match one and make
[00:53:34] that change the rate, it wouldn't impact anything. We got an economic issue there with just the
[00:53:40] nature of the lending and the bond market and the mortgage market. We can't control any of that,
[00:53:44] but what we can do is we can pay attention to our clients. And I think too, it's a great opportunity
[00:53:50] to partner up with life event service partners, such as estate planning attorneys, divorce attorneys,
[00:53:58] accountants, people that are aware of maybe their clients' needs, their life event needs,
[00:54:04] in relation to their financial health, and can actually say, you know, now's a good time to move,
[00:54:09] or you have to move. I've got a good REALTOR that I trust, you know, that I want to introduce you to.
[00:54:14] If it was me, I would be looking, I mean, look, as unfortunate as this is to say, I think
[00:54:20] that the divorce rate currently is around 57% of all marriages that have come up post-pandemic,
[00:54:27] I believe. I believe that's accurate or close to it. Yeah, the pandemic put a dollar room with somebody
[00:54:30] that we might not like. Either accelerated intimacy or it blew it up.
[00:54:39] So anyway, the reality of it is we just have a lot of divorces, and so this is a huge opportunity,
[00:54:44] people who are getting divorced, they have to move. Somebody's going to move most likely in every
[00:54:49] scenario. So this is a great opportunity to really think about life events. You know, those people
[00:54:53] have to move at a certain time, and again, probably beating a horse at this point with that, but
[00:54:58] great opportunity there. Yeah, yeah. But yeah, if you're not doing the business you want to do,
[00:55:02] then you need to add something or change something. And you know, it's getting a four-fronted
[00:55:07] always I talked about, you know, rewind the tape, go back, and then we have a lot of material on
[00:55:11] that at our company. You know, we talked about that all the time. One last question I have,
[00:55:16] Jack Ferry, because I know you're a busy guy and you've already spent a tremendous amount of time
[00:55:19] with us. I wanted to just talk about this and get your thoughts about it, which is, this is in your
[00:55:24] report, which really, it's always funny to me when I see this in a report because it's something
[00:55:32] that we bring up all the time, and it doesn't seem to really change much, which is that the number of
[00:55:36] hours somebody needs to embark on to become a real estate professional is really out of alignment
[00:55:43] with other industries who have much less at stake for those services, right? So, you know, my
[00:55:49] here in Illinois, if you want to cut hair, if you want to be a, you know, whatever, you know,
[00:55:58] Cosmitalogy or whatever that's called. Cosmitalogy, if you want to be a cosmologist, you have to do
[00:56:04] 1500 hours of actual like working with clients before it takes years. And so we know that in Illinois,
[00:56:14] we used to have to become a real estate license. We called them brokers here, but real estate agent
[00:56:18] essentially used to have to do 90 hours. Now it's 75 hours. We even produced it. So I'm wondering if
[00:56:25] you see that changing to help elevate some of the professionalism or
[00:56:30] you know, we advocated for it in the opportunity report. And I've personally done some work,
[00:56:37] some consulting work with some states, state associations and lobby for those kinds of changes.
[00:56:42] And I'd say it's hard, it's a hard road because a lot of states want to keep the regulatory
[00:56:48] limitations very low. They want to make real estate easy to get into. And that's understood.
[00:56:52] I understand that from a free market, capitalism perspective, I get it. The reality is we need
[00:56:59] an agent to be productive in this industry needs more training. They need more mentorship and
[00:57:04] apprenticeship. And so in working with our clients, that's what we advocate. They'd like you
[00:57:09] bring agents in. You need to have them really apprentice and set up a program to do that.
[00:57:15] Some states are making changes there or are requiring more like Texas is I live in Texas. This
[00:57:22] state requires has been uping its requirements over the last decade and half. I think it now takes
[00:57:27] 240 hours to get licensed here. It's the most in the country. The renewal requirements are
[00:57:36] higher here. The broker requirements are going to broker license here. You have to do a certain
[00:57:40] number of transactions and have it. You can't just go to the broker course and go take the broker
[00:57:46] licensing and not your broker. You have to actually have done transactions or some requirements
[00:57:51] around it. And I think those are the kinds of things that are sensible. But this is where I believe
[00:57:55] the state associations complex are on hold in educating the biggest gap we have is the regulators
[00:58:01] and the lawmakers in many states do not really understand real estate. And they see it as a
[00:58:08] they don't they don't understand the mechanisms of our profession and the risks and the cost
[00:58:13] and the liabilities and all of that. I mean you get a bad haircut. It's fixed in two weeks.
[00:58:18] You know it's not it's not the end of the world. You go through a bad real estate transaction.
[00:58:21] You're in a lawsuit, lost time, effort, money, substantial potential damage to people financially
[00:58:28] or personally where they're in a house. It's unhealthy for them to be in. So it's a lot. And I
[00:58:34] think this is where we need to do a better job as an industry educating the regulators, educating
[00:58:39] lawmakers about why our industry may need more more credentialing because of how easy it is to
[00:58:47] get licensed to come in and do a bunch of stuff. If you're a professional in like construction
[00:58:51] engineering, in your working at construction firm, you have you know you're building bridges,
[00:58:57] you're building stuff like that. There's there's there's a level of impact that is reflected by
[00:59:01] the amount of licensure and being certified as a professional engineer and the contracts required
[00:59:06] that people have a certain amount of background. And those are the kinds of things that I believe
[00:59:10] need to come more into real estate. Not so high to make this a I don't want to this should never be
[00:59:15] an industry that creates barriers. It's impossible for people to join it. But at the same time it
[00:59:20] needs to reflect the level of responsibility and risk that's involved in real estate transaction
[00:59:25] for the average risk. So the through line that I heard not just you've talked about in the
[00:59:31] opportunity to report again the opportunity report.com is where you can download this gosh I don't
[00:59:36] know is it maybe a hundred page document. Yeah, hundred pages. It's not dense. It's not like
[00:59:43] it's not like a slow yeah. No, it's it's everybody should go to this the opportunity to report.com
[00:59:48] this will help not only give you some confidence in what's going on in the industry but also give
[00:59:53] you some ideas of trends. But the through line as as Jack has said since date since the minute one
[00:59:58] is value. So I think increasing your value to the to the public is really what agents can work on
[01:00:04] and can maybe expect to have a successful year if they're work if they're focused on value.
[01:00:11] Yeah, 100. Well there we got no so I want everybody right now to do a couple of things. One,
[01:00:18] the opportunity report.com downloads your your free report and it is it is I almost wish that you
[01:00:24] charge people a dollar for it just so that they would because we know that you know people don't
[01:00:28] value. People pay for things when they pay for it then they'll like take it a little more seriously.
[01:00:32] But yeah, it is it is so it is so much it is so it is worth thousands of dollars what you have
[01:00:38] put out there real seriously and it's amazing. So thank you for providing that to the industry that
[01:00:44] is incredibly generous and something that is really helpful to all of us whether we're in the
[01:00:50] brokerage side or where actual agents ourselves or both. So thank you for that and I want you also
[01:00:56] to start getting into the habit of checking real estate news.com there's a there's a new new game in
[01:01:02] town, a new player in the in the space of news and you might not know them yet. So check them out,

Now as a real estate recruiter, I can tell you the answer is always yes. But most agents aren't looking to move right now. So how do you know who to contact? Well, what if I were to tell you there's a recruiting and retention tool powered by artificial intelligence that shows you exactly which agents in your local market are looking to leave their brokerage right now and which agents at your own firm are also looking to leave you? Now I've been recruiting REALTORS for 15 years and I've hired over 2000 agents. I can tell you with no exaggeration, this is the tool I've been waiting for. Corded's AI looks for trends across dozens of variables for each agent in your market and shows you which agents they believe are likely to move. Not only does it do that, but corded's AI went and visited my recruiting website and read everything I offer. So now when I'm recruiting, corded's AI tells me exactly what to say based on that agent's needs and what my brokerage can offer. It even writes emails for me. I've never seen anything like it and I use it every single day. Now if you are looking to grow your brokerage, corded.io is the best tool out there. Visit corded.io to schedule a demo again. That's corded.io. And now onto the show. Hello and welcome to another episode of Keeping It Real, the largest podcast made by real estate agents and four real estate agents. My name is DJ Paris. I am your guide and host through the show. And just a moment, we're going to be speaking with the CEO of T360 which is the largest consulting firm for residential real estate brokerages and REALTORS, Jack Miller. Before we get to Jack Miller, just a few quick reminders. As always, please help us by telling a friend about this episode, especially this one. This is a particularly good one to send to not just the REALTORS in your office, but also the owner of your company or your managing broker. There's a lot of good stuff here about how to help brokerages and REALTORS run more effectively. We're going to get to that in just a second. In addition to telling a friend, please leave us a review. Let us know what you think of the show. It helps us get in front of more ears as well as helps us learn what you like and what we can do to improve. But let's just get right to it. My conversation with Jack Miller. Hey, today on the show, my guest is Jack Miller. Who's the CEO of T360, which is a real estate consulting agency. I'll tell you more about Jack and T360. Jack is responsible for the overall management and financial health of T360. He previously served as T360's chief technology officer and lead of T3 Fellows, which is a division of T360. He has two decades of real estate industry experience with management roles in franchising, franchise ownership and brokerage. Prior to joining the real estate industry, Jack worked in multiple technology startup companies, including as a partner and investor. He is a consistent contributor to the Swannipoll trends report, as well as various white papers and abstracts on technology. Jack has a bachelor's of science in electrical and computer engineering from the University of Texas. For those of you that go, I do not know T360. I will tell you from a brokerage perspective, they are the news source and the data source and the analysts that brokerages look to to say, what's going on in the industry, what's the health of the industry, where is it going? This is the company that we all look to. This is a very special episode for me to talk to. The CEO, Jack, welcome to the show. DJ, I'm delighted to be here and to be here with your listeners. We're going to do some fun stuff today. Yeah, let's dive right into it. Before we get started, I would love to just set this table. For what T360 is and how it got started and how it got to where it is today. Yeah, and I'll use it as a little opportunity to give my bios and color because it's, I think people hear that and they're like, does Jack know anything about our industry because I can't tell, right? Because it's a little, it's high level. But I came to the industry in 2001 and I worked for a national franchise. I actually worked directly for Gary Keller and Moanderson when they were building Kevileums into a national company. It was really a regional franchise company at the time and I did come out of the tech industry. But I've been in the industry since then and have owned and operated franchises in the Kevileums network, have run an independent brokerage here in Austin with some partners and got licensed and sold real estate myself. And so for a lot of your listeners, it's like, I've been in your chair. There's almost no part of franchise brokerage, all of those things that I've not done. And I have enormous passion for. And so that's what I'll say just about my personal background is I became, I started as a tech guy, I became a real estate person in 2001 and have just fallen in love with this industry ever since. Our team, we have about 40 people that work for T360 and our media affiliate, real estate news. T360, we decided to design a consulting and management company really for residential brokerage industry. And, you know, there's a lot of big consulting companies like McKinsey or Pricewater, Cooper, KPMG. And they, you know, they serve the financial industry and the healthcare industry and all these other industries. There really has not been the equivalent of those kinds of companies for residential brokerage. And so we currently serve about 300 clients in the brokerage, MLS, association and technology space that all do work in residential real estate brokerage. So it's all residential estate brokerage focused. We're doing a little bit of work in mortgage right now. There's some opportunities in that space that we're exploring. And we also produce two books a year. We do the Swanthal Trends report, which is known as 20th edition. And that's an overview of the trends that we believe will impact the industry for the next two to three years. Essential reading for anybody in real estate leadership, we believe. And that's currently distributed to a couple thousand leaders every year. And that's a pay for report. You can get it t3trends.com. And then we have a free report, which is the real estate all men act. And it's a comprehensive evaluation and list of top 1000 brokerages, all the big, all of the MLS's, all the associations, the top 200 leaders in the industry, which we do a very diligent ranking exercise every year to rank the top 200 leaders. All the large technology companies, just about 200 technology companies in the industry. We also categorize as these are the top companies in each product category. All that is at real estate all men act.com. And again, we also publish a book that goes as a chunky 500 page all men act type book every year. So that's, we produce intelligence for the industry, but we also do tons and tons of projects and consulting. And you know, there, and you have four former CEOs that work within the company and a whole team of people that came out of the industry that are here to give extra horsepower to a broker and MLS and association of big team. You're like, hey, I need some, I'm going to make some changes in my business. So we're, we're the right people to talk to you for doing that. Yeah, thanks for that. And also too, you have a new report that is out called the opportunity report. And I believe this is in conjunction with homes.com. And it is really a good sample of what you guys do in the industry. And people can actually download this report. You should. It is jam full of great information. I was reading through it this morning. It's the opportunity report.com will have a link to that in the show notes. We'll be talking about that today, that specific report. And also a T360 has a news arm of their company. So if you're somebody who likes to read real estate brokerage news, real estate news.com should be added to your watch list. They're fantastic. Sign up for their email list, but make, you know, bookmark that because there aren't a lot of great real estate news sites online and real estate news is newer. And they are nipping at the heels of some of the big boys out there. So check them out. And they have really great articles of what Jack was telling me earlier, because I wasn't as familiar. What I love is they do a summary at the beginning of each of each article, which is really, it's like too long didn't read kind of stereo. You could just go right to it. So for all you guys people, you'll love it. That news arm, they send one email a day with the news stories that we think real estate professionals should pay attention to. Every article has a bullet summary at the beginning that you can digest in probably 10 seconds. So that you know, and if you want to read the article, it's all there, but there's always a summary. And there's, it's not a pay to play type of organization. It is something where, you know, we only write about what we think industry professionals need to hear. So and, and you can, the daily emails free, you can sign up for a subscription to get access to all of the articles in the additional research we published there. That's real estate news.com and then also again, the opportunity report.com is where you can download that report. And just for everyone out there who's still, you know, getting acclimated now to T 360, this might be the first time you're aware of them. I will tell you, from a brokerage perspective, we look at like two reports a year. One is whatever T 360 is saying we're going to read it and the Zillow report every year, just on the data, they collect. Those are the two big ones. And, you know, this is, this is really so much fun to talk to you because right now, the industry is in flux a bit or at least going through change or has been going, has been going through change and people are agents are sort of interested to know what the analysts and the consultants think is the future of real estate brokerage and agents themselves. So I asked our audience to come up with some questions for you and funny enough, I think most of them are actually talked about in the opportunity report again, opportunity report. The opportunity report.com again, link to that in the show notes. But can we just dive right into some topics and have you give us a take? I want to give a little bit of background just to know where the information comes from because this is, this is, it'd be very easy to hear this and go like, these guys just make this up, you know, where did this come from? So 10 years ago, NAR paid our firm to do a risk assessment of the industry. And in that, we had our founder and my partners, DeFan, flew and visited in person with 50 leaders in the industry in their offices, confidential interviews. We also did surveys and we did some focus group work and we compiled it all into a report, which is called the danger report, which we released in 2015. So that report, overviewed all of the risks that we thought the industry was facing at that time. The opportunity report is really an update to that danger report, but from a different perspective. And this time, the work was sponsored via homes.com. And we follow the same process. We interviewed, we picked 50 of the leaders of large or important organizations in the industry from across the spectrum, brokerage, franchise, MLS association, some other consultants, some other people that do work in the industry, you know, leadership level media organizations and said, what do we think the big opportunities are for real estate professionals right now? And so a lot of what I'll say is, we talk to a ton of really smart people. It isn't all our original thoughts. We synthesized it into a single document and there's some different perspectives offered in the document, but they all highlight these are the things that we think are important to pay attention to right now. Now, the danger report, we did do an analysis of the danger report that we wrote 10 years ago about all those risks. And in front of the opportunity reports, kind of fun. We gave the danger report to chat GPT and said evaluate our report. How well we did. Yeah, it was the score. How did we do? And there were, you know, again, about, you know, 25, 30 different dangers all broken out by industry segment. And overall, it gave that report an 83% score of accuracy. And it went one, you know, piece by piece by piece. And there were many things in there like regulatory impact on the industry. 100%. That's absolutely happened. The industry has had regulatory impact, right? The growth and dominance of teams in, you know, growth of sales volume, commission compression, all of these changes that we all know have happened. It rated all of those. And so what I would say to the listener is that if you're like, well, why should I read this report? Well, the same organization that produced the danger report 10 years ago, had 83% accuracy has produced another report with the same methodology. It's likely to have a similar degree of accuracy. So if you knew you could get a document, it was 83% accurate about what's going to happen 10 years in the future, I would recommend you read it. Well, I would, I wouldn't even say how much would you pay for something like that, right? And the fact that you don't have to pay for this particular report and other reports T360 does is of course behind a paywall because, you know, they're a company they need to make profit. But this is something that everyone should read about. And again, even if half of it is true, which of course the data would maybe suggest that more than half of it should be true. But even if half of it's true, there's lots of good takeaways in here. And just to sort of talk about this report a little, high level, what were some of the trends that you saw starting to emerge as you were working this report? So there's a through line in the whole report that I talk about because you go through it and you go, what's the, what is the, what's the big theme? What's the big message? And the big message is really about value. It is about the consumer valuing the agent and how that happens now because we've got a major shift in that relationship. It's about how the real estate professional values the MLS, their local, their state, and the National Association. And we're in a time DJ where there's been some, there's been some loss of trust in institutions. And not just in our industry, I think this is broadly, broadly true in North America and in the US. As we've said, we don't think these institutions have done their job. And that's part of what we listen. We interviewed these 50 leaders and they said, look, some of the institutions are industry have not done the job they need to be for us. And so the way you rebuild, the way you move forward with that and an opportunistic framework is you work on value. And that, and as an agent practitioner or as a broker, we need to demonstrate our value to the consumer. Which by the way, the good news is, I think the industry has tons of value. You know, I've been a practitioner, I've sold real estate myself, I had agents that work for us and the franchises that I had ownership in and the local broker that you have here in Austin. I've spent a lot of time, you know, I've spent a lot of time up close and personal. And there's tremendous value that the industry has. We're just not very good about talking about it. We're not very good about explaining it. We're not very good about packaging and positioning it. I think we do a pretty good job on the listing side. I think that's where listing agents, generally probably anyone of your listeners, we could we could get them on and say, give us your listing presentation. Yeah, listing vision they've done it for a while. They probably do a pretty good job. Yeah. We're going to bring somebody on that works with buyers. And it's going to be a little spotty because they've not been asked to discuss, present and help people understand their value at the level that they are now. And I think that's the big transition we're going to. Is that? And having the buyer sign off on the commission agreement. Like having that, you know, I think it could be pretty well easily argued that buyers were always paying commissions. In some form or another, they just weren't made necessarily seeing. They weren't writing the check. They weren't seeing the actual money flow from their big account out to a particular commission. But now they now they do. So you're right. Those conversations are just much different. Yeah, for sure. But that's the through line in the report. And so I think we're set up. I mean, we can dive in any. There's particular areas, but but as many of the areas are going to come back to how is the industry demonstrating value either the consumer, the practitioner. And that's the big thing. Well, my first question is about the NAR settlement. And in particular, within the industry, and the agent side and on the brokerage side, it's all we've really heard about for the last, you know, year and a half or so. Sure. However, and we see lots of news articles being written for the public about this. Of course, it's made lots of news. How aware is the public about what's going on with NAR and is that affecting their their perception of the value of a real estate agent? So both less than we think because, you know, this is one of those problems where we're in the industry. And so we think about it all the time. And so our experience is very, very different from the average consumer. The average consumer, they engage with their industry once every 10 to 10. It's actually now an average of every 12 years. It's pretty frequent. It's a major life of it when they do though. So it's important, but they're not as engaged with the day to day. And so unless you're talking to people that are, you know, really in the process, I mean, people in the process are paying attention to news about the process. They're paying attention to real estate. And we've definitely had, it's come up in our surveys and in other surveys that we're aware of, like, you know, a thousand of us has done some great survey work in the consumer space. And we talk to them all the time. Tom Ferry runs a coaching organization. They've done some survey work. And it's absolutely coming up in listing appointments and, you know, people are saying what they're seeing in the media. But for a lot of the consumer public, if they're not engaged in a real estate process, they're probably not giving a lot of attention. Much like, you know, if there's something I'm not engaged in in my day to day life, you know, I may have peripheral awareness or no awareness of it. So, sort of depends on where that consumer is in their real estate life cycle, you know, and if they're more actively engaged and more likely they are paying attention to news about real estate. And it is, we're hearing regular reports and then I'm on, I'm on all Facebook groups, all your listeners are on. So I see that. So I've seen agents say, hey, this is coming up. I'm hearing this. Now we did some of our own surveys after, you know, after the August 17th, some of that has fed into our trends report, which we're releasing in two weeks here. And that report and the survey work we did indicated that there's a significant portion of agents who work on the by side where it's about 40% where it's impacted their ability to sign by our clients, meaning they had to do some, they had to do some explaining. It's like, hey, this isn't as easy as it used to be to just, you know, get the car and go with the client. And so it is that now, I think that's going to go down. I think in a year for now, this will be old news. Everybody will have understood. Here's how to talk. So I'd say they'll have perfected the buyer pitch. They don't know. Yeah, I know what my value is as a buyer's agent. I know what things like here's good examples of how I create value. Here's clients that I work with and what I did for them, you know, people are going to get their, they're going to get their explanation really well home. And if they don't, they're going to get out. You know, they're going to, if you can't explain what you're doing in a way that, where the consumer understands it and is going to sign up for it on front end, then you're not, then that's part of the job you can't do. And that's an important part of the job now and in the future. So another question about agents themselves. And I want to specifically talk about dual career versus single career only because we have a holding company here in Illinois that we run, which is for agents who aren't actively practicing, but when they keep their license active, again, they're not working in the industry at the time. At the beginning of the year, we had, we've had it for about 10 years or so. We had 800 agents in this holding company. This is in Illinois. We can kind of hold licenses all throughout the state. And by the end of this year, we'll be close to 1300 agents. So we were seeing a bit of a, a huge increase in people leaving the industry, which I suspect are mostly dual career agents. But I'm curious to see what data you guys have or what trends you see about the role of the dual career agent moving forward versus single career. Yeah, this has been, this is an industry that has a lot of that. You know, it has a lot of people to do something else, but also do real estate. And, you know, policeman, fireman, teachers, you know, there's many, there's many people that have a singular job that they've done for a long time. And then they add real estate to the mix. And it's an additional income for them. So what I will say is that I don't think the, the dual career person or the person that uses real estate as an additional income stream is going to necessarily go away. And as a matter of fact, there's, there's a good case for it. The, the people I wrote an article for those days last fall. And that article, you know, I said, the people that are likely to really struggle are the single career real estate people who really quite, they haven't quite established their career. Like they're, they're doing, you know, three, four or five transactions a year. And with all, and they really do like real estate pays their mortgage and their light bill. And they're, they're very dependent on it. And, you know, those are the folks that are most I think. And at the time, my, what the article's written for brokers is, look, brokers, this is who you need to help right now is to make sure if you've got talented people, they need that extra step in their career. So where they can really make this a full time, where real estate is their full time profession. Because of the market and these changes, they're going to need some extra support right now. But I think the dual career folks are fine with the caveat that, you know, if they're referral only status, that's a whole different thing. Right. If you're actually practicing real estate, you of course have to be at that level of professional service. You're going to have to be able to represent talk about your value. You're going to have to do all those things are now. It doesn't matter if you're full time or part time. You have to be as professional as possible. And there's good, you know, this industry loves to beat up on people they're part time in history. It's they love it. We love it. But actually when you dig in, it's not the complaint is not, hey, this person is a part-time agent. The complaint is actually, they're not professional. They don't do a good job. They don't communicate with their client or with the cooperating broker. They don't, you know, like that kind of thing. That's actually the root of that complaint. It's not about the part-time status. And by the way, I think there's some for some consumers, the agent who is already made their money and is retired. This is extra money for them and they just do it to serve their community. It's actually a great agent to work with because it's no pressure. Because they're saying, hey, I don't need this, I don't need this deal to pay my light bill. I'm doing this because I want to take care of you and your family. And I use it to make a little extra money, but it's not the only money that I make, right? So there's a case to be named where that dual career agent can be of better service. With the caveat that they have to be at above a certain level professionalism. And I also agree with some of the thinking, and I think our firm is going to do some of the thinking that you need to be doing a certain number of transactions here just to keep your skills up, right? Just to know what's happening in the market. You know, you can't check out. You've got to be plugged in enough to do that. If you got a good broker, you got a good coach, you've got to make sure you're doing that. And then absolutely. But that's kind of what I'd say overall. As far as numbers, we are seeing renewal numbers. We're in renewal, as we're recording this podcast. We're in the renewal period for a lot of people's memberships in their associations. And the early take we have on it is that their renewal numbers will be down. And I've talked to some very large organizations that are sharing numbers a little preliminarily with us. And it does appear that people are getting out. Now, I don't know if they're necessarily the real career people or that single career person who's not an establishment. But we'll know, we'll probably know in February, where we've shaken out too. And it's fine. You know, it's just a natural. We're going through a natural cycle. You know, this is a tough time to be in the industry. And if you're not committed to it or you have other ways to make a money that are easier for you, then it makes sense. People will do other stuff. And they should do other stuff to take care of their families. But the career people are in it. You know, the lifelong professionals, they've seen storms before they weathered them before. And they're actually going to end up being the beneficiaries of all this change. Yeah, because they'll pick up market share from some of the people that leave the industry. And that's what's been super interesting to me. I interview top 1% agents across the country on the show. And none of them have really expressed a tremendous concern, other than just the overall health of the industry is obviously a consideration. But for their own personal production, they're not worried. And I think, well, that's a healthy side. If the top agents are going, hey, things are okay. Then and a lot of the top agents, when the buyer compensation, the agency agreement, you know, sort of went into effect, they were like, oh, I already do this. Or this is an easy pivot for me. I, you know, it's not a big deal. And so that was really encouraging to talk to these top agents who are like, nah, not a big deal. Yeah, and I think that's, again, I think a year from now, this will be, this will be old, old discussion, all the pros have figured it out. And then it's just now it's just a training issue for the new people to come in and say, here's how we do it. And, you know, it's just be the way we do business. So, so again, I think we're going to look at it and say, well, and I do think it will improve has the opportunity to improve the relationship we have with consumer, which is one of the, one of the items in the report is like, this is where you need to elevate our description of the services and help consumers understand them. Because right now, we're getting run down on the media. We're getting run down, you know, we are being portrayed as an industry that does not provide value when I know truth is on our side that we do provide a lot of value. We just have to get better about talking about it. We have to, we have to show up and really do do a great job of that. And that is the opportunity right now is elevating the professional, elevating the services that we provide, being better at explaining it all to the consumer, getting our own media stories, getting our own narratives out of the media about what we do as a profession. And that's the route out. But I don't see another, there's not another better way. It's like we need to, we need to elevate the profession itself. Yeah, I always think to it's sort of like the shift from advertising to providing value. A lot of agents love to advertise, right? They just listed, just sold, you know, look at how much production I'm doing. And again, I'm not here to denigrate any of that. That's great. And this idea of providing true value is what your customers really want is, what should they do with their homes right now? Should they think about refinancing? Should they think about moving? What neighborhood are they looking to next? What, you know, all of the important life event stuff is where agents can really step in in between the sales while they're in that 12-year holding period at that home and continue to somehow provide value to that homeowner throughout that lifespan. So that when they are ready to make that next transition, of course, that agent would be first of mind. But what I will say is, it's that road of providing value for like say a 12-year period after somebody, you know, buys a home. Is not a crowded road. So if you are an agent that, you know, whether it's your transaction or not, maybe it wasn't your purchase, but you want to develop a relationship with that homeowner, I can almost assure you that person's agent will probably not be providing a tremendous amount of that. Now, hopefully they will. But in most cases, I think, you know, people get forgotten about and there's a lot of opportunity to step in and say, hey, I want to start, you know, telling you about things that you care about, you know, during that time. There's a reason this industry spends billions of dollars to talk to consumers that don't have an agent. And it's because that they those consumers were probably abandoned or forgotten about or their agent got out of the business. And so that's that is and you don't have to spend billions of dollars to do that. You could just do it. Right. So again, I know we've got, you know, some of this is going to be preaching to the choir. You have some top agents. Listen to this. The the act of staying in touch with your community and with people in your life as a as a friend, but also as a real estate professional is the lifelong skill that of this industry. And most people don't go the distance. And you're correct. It's not a crowded road of staying in touch with those consumers. And you know, a direct male campaign is not enough, you know, you need to do, you need to do a little bit more. And then when it's time to transact, that's when you go high stakes in terms of, here's my value proposition, here's what I do, here's how I'm going to save you money, help you get the home you want, help you get from where you are today, where you want to be, and becoming an expert at that conversation with lots of specific examples so that you can help your client understand it. You know, that's the skill. That's the skill. You know, I want to switch to some topics that are of interest to every one of our agents for sure, which is commissions. So let's talk about the our commissions increasing, decreasing, is there a compression going on? Where do you see that headed? And we'll start with, still we'll start there. So tell us what you think is going to happen to commissions. In the in the opportunity report, we did talk about that, but it wasn't a focus of the report. It wasn't a focus of like, hey, we're surveying the top leaders industry, find out where commissions were and the report was done over the summer. So some of it was before the settlement changes. Subsequent to the report, we did run a survey and did some survey work to find out what people were seeing. And it's really interesting DJ. We saw we have seen that. There there absolutely are some agents experiencing commission compression where they're they're they're not, you know, they're they're seeing their commission pressurized. But on the flip side, we're also seeing agents on the buy side, they're saying they're making more money now. But because because and here's the key point, they're no longer relying on the I want the listing agent. Right. So they're they are they are instead saying I'm going to stand in my own two feet and explain my value proposition and sign an agreement of what, you know, what my time value of money is. And and then getting that. And so and this was confirmed by spoke with Tom Ferry. I was in his office about a month ago. We did a we also did a podcast there. And and he's done some survey work with his coaching base. And and that was he was finding that that was consistent in the survey responses. There's a pretty healthy sized group of agents that are now actually they effectively given themselves a raise because they are now addressing their compensation on the front end, explaining their value, and they're getting it. And then they're going into the transaction and they're negotiating as part of the transaction. It's like, hey, I'm going to submit an offer. Here's the offer. Here's the you know, the closing costs we're asking for some which will be used to cover their, you know, their compensation. So so I think this is a. This is a choose your own adventure type of situation. You know, you can treat it as weather. You can say as the weather good or bad outside. Or you can decide how you want the weather to be for you in this instance. Or you can say, look, I'm I'm going to make sure that my values represented and because my time is valuable. And so that's that's the that's the shakeout. Now do I think overall overall that probably means because there's a lot of people that are going to struggle to negotiate their value. And so those that group will experience commission compression. They're not going to be able to they just won't be as good negotiating their value. And they probably won't make as much, which means they probably some segment of them will get out. And then the people that can't explain value will will take that barcode share. So so I'd say it all points in the same direction. And all points to developing that professional narrative and approach to the business and understanding your value. There's some great tools for explaining your value coming out right now. Like I'm a big fan of James Dwaygens and the work that they're doing over the days. R-A-Y-S-E.com. And they're building a tool that keeps track of everything you do for your clients. And pulls it out of your email, your calendar, your text messages. Oh, I love that. It's super cool. It pulls it out and puts it all in a report. And then it tells you, here's how many hours you still with a client in meetings. Here's how many how much time you spend driving around. Here's all that kind of stuff. And creates a really great summary. And then you can use that in your meetings and say, Hey, this is this is an aggregate report showing the amount of time. Because again, a thousand of them are really great surveyed with consumers. And they found that consumers think that the average consumer thinks that we spend about 15 hours on a transaction. When the reality is, it's closer to 80 to 85 hours for transactions. So the consumer's impression is wrong in terms of how much time and effort most agents put into a transaction. And this is where I say truth is on our side. You know, the amount of work, consumers value the work that's being done when they understand it. They have a miscalibration about how much time it actually takes to do a transaction. And that's not to say, of course, there's some transactions that are easier than others. But on average, it's a lot higher than the average consumer thinks. So those are things that, you know, that I would say the industry should use as tools like that and understanding like that to navigate more effectively. The other thing I'll give you, DJ, which your audience should know. And it's in the opportunity report. It's in our trends report is that the agents have more value than they think they do. And when you ask the consumer and you ask the consumer, hey, what's important about your agent? And the number one thing is not the cheapest deal. North American consumers are not cheap. We're not cheapest deal people for the most part. Now, there's always, we're always looking for a deal. But what we place above deal is service and trust. That's above. And in the survey work, 1000 watt is done, which has been fabulous. That's that leads. And so, you know, yes, there are always going to be people that are looking for how to do something cheaper, but they won't do it with something that they don't trust. Right? They want trust. They want knowledge. They want service. Right? If they can't get that at a lower price, they will pay a higher price. And the anecdote I use on stages, we're an economy and a people that we will pay more to have the food delivered than we will for the food itself. 100%. We value the service. We value the service. This is a very service focus. The North American consumer is very service focused and wants that. And that sounds like all of this. This is in the opportunity report. It's in our trends report. It's in what we've been studying for years. It's validated by survey work done by us and done by others. And what I say is like, this is some fundamental stuff that as a professional, you can operate with confidence from that and build your business around that. And if you do, you'll be successful. You know, that's all it is. Again, the opportunity report.com is where you go to read their most recent information and analysis of the industry. Now I want to talk about brokerage or splits for agents. Do we see a compression there? Do we see splits increasing, decreasing? You know, where do you see trends headed there? You know what's interesting? So we did this. This is not opportunity report. This is out of our research work in Real Estate, Almanac. And we wrote about it in a trend report two years ago. Actually, no, it's an industry's trend report we haven't knew. We expanded this one. So we looked at what are the broker condition models that are growing the most right now? What are the ones that are really gaining? And if you look, we looked at the top 100 brokerages in the industry and looked at the composition of those brokerages. And what we're seeing is that all commission models but one are growing in terms of demographically growing. The traditional business model where you have a graduated commit, graduated commission split is generally declining. It isn't to say that it's bad. This is not a good bad conversation. It's just there's more companies that are doing more sales volume than removing another models. The most, the model that has grown the most over the last five years is a Capped Commission model, something where there's a cap above beyond the cap where you pay just a transaction fee or something like that. And that represents that's what I would refer to as the Kelley's model. Like that, that model is the one that in the top 100 brokerages has grown the most and substantially the most in the last few years. But transaction unit, your transaction fee models, those have grown. And also the fourth model that we talk about, which is really the team or business generation model where you have teams who are generating business for their agents. Very profitable model for a broker or a team to operate on. Very challenging to operate. You need some skills to operate it. But that one is also growing. So that's roughly the landscape. I don't know what that means in terms of commission splits for individual agents that are listening to this podcast. That's just overall, we look at the top 100 brokerages we're finding that there are more brokers doing more sales volume and on a growth perspective. They're in some kind of capped model. But what I will tell you is that agents for the most part have already squeezed all the value out of most brokerages. Most brokers, they're marked most of them. We did another study with a account tag, which is an accounting provider. Again, looked at about 100 brokerages. That's not the top 100, but 100 brokerage sampled out of their accounting set. And about 40% of them were unprofitable. And 60% that were the big chunk of that was below 4% profitability. So fairly low profitability. If you look at the landscape, your broker doesn't have more money to get. You've probably already got most of it. Where we center on is what's most important is not how much money you give your brokerage. That is a dumb, boring, uninteresting conversation. Because the real thing is what do you need in order to run your business? Right. And how can you source that? And there are many brokers that are very effective at providing services and support that enable an agent to do another 5 or 6, 7 transactions a year. Because they don't have to do the administrative work. They don't have to do the transaction work. They don't have to do the marketing work. And they can focus on the high value part, which is meeting work with clients. And so that's what I tell people, say, well, I just want to go and go. If you're an agent that wants to do every stupid little thing in your business, if you want to upload stuff in the MLS, you want to manage your own transactions. If you want to do all of that, go to a place that charges your low transaction fee and covers your ENO. Fine, do it that way. Are you going to make the most amount of money that way? I think there's a real question. Myself personally, I've had a license to transact it. I don't want to do all that stuff. And I would try to broker that offer me some staffing and some support. And because what I want to do is I want to meet with prospective clients. I'm going to go to lunch, go to dinner, I want to have a full calendar of prospective client meetings. And I want to hand all that work off to somebody. And so I find a broker that supports me in that kind of way. So I think people get focused on the wrong thing. They're like, oh, I get a better one. And I'll tell you, we've interviewed tons of brokers, tons of agents. People don't leave the brokerage that they're with because of a commission issue. Correct. They leave the brokerage because of something else. Service or support. Somebody ticked them off. Somebody did something they didn't like. Their broker didn't show up for them in a critical moment. Right. That's why they leave and then they blame it on them. They offer me a better deal. No, no, no. It's the agent is no different from the consumer in North America. The agent is willing to pay for value. That's why we're seeing growth of things like, you know, we see place, which is, you know, Ben Kinney's outfit that it provides additional services and support for people. It's where we see companies like Sines or we see companies that provide. You know, that's that was really people like to say, well, the growth story of Compass was all about they just bottle these agents. And there's a part of that that's true. But the other part of that that's true is they offered them a lot of services and support. And they said, look, you don't have to have a marketing ad full-time marketing adman because we'll do it. Or our technology platform plus our admance staff will do it. So that so people are willing to pay for that. And in Quizz Dilly, one of the air, one of the segments that has been the most resilient has been the high end segment. The Sotheby's has been really on a tear. The last few years of Reed Art, Almanac reports you'll see they've been a growth gainer. And the high end and what does high end brokerages do? They provide a lot of services to their agents. They provide a lot of support and they've been able to hold their margins better because of that. Because the agent says, this is really like I want to spend time with high net worth clients, which take a lot of time. They're more intense client. So that's what I'd say is this commission thing, don't get distracted, go get the support and service you need in order to run your business and pay for it. Because you can pay for it one way or another. And here are the most expensive way to pay for it in most cases. Yeah, what I'm hearing from a brokerage or a team perspective who's looking to recruit members look for solutions to whatever that agent you're trying to recruit's business is, whatever problems that business is experiencing. And it might be commission split, but it's probably more than that. Because if it was just commission split, everyone would be at a transaction-based firm. They'd all be paying $400 a transaction and we'd all go on our merry way. And we find that in most cases, top producers aren't at those firms because oftentimes the services are not as prevalent. The service, the brand, the whole the value package. If conversation starts with what commissions split, you actually have the wrong conversation. You start with the value, understand the value, how does it help you? I always tell brokers, you shouldn't be measuring things. The way you should be measuring things is how many successful agents are you creating in your brokerage? Who's getting to go on vacations? Who's sending their kids to nice schools that they want to send their kids to? Who's able to fulfill their retirement ambitions? The other word, that's what we should be measuring. Not that commission, people go straight to the commission split and you're measuring the wrong thing. That's the dumb thing to measure. Let's measure outcomes. Let's look at lives. And I'd say the same to the agent, you need to look at your life. Does the broker to risk or you and the way you do business? That's the most important thing. Absolutely agree. I want to circle back to value because our listeners are individual practitioners or team leads or team members. broker-johners as well, we're all thinking about how do we keep the train rolling while obviously listings are down right now. It's a little bit trickier to work with buyers at present day. Obviously rates aren't exactly where anyone would prefer them to be in relation to three years ago. It's a tricky time. And so if you were out there practicing today and you were thinking about your 2025 business plan, and I know you're going to say lots to do with value, but I'm curious if there's specific, anything specific that you'd say I would focus on this? Yeah, so I was in broker should be a great financial crisis and we had to get real creative. Right? Because we had this we had a similar problem. We had listings that were sitting for longer and longer and we had buyers that couldn't work the bottom because of that. So it was a similar problem. So what we wanted to do is first of all know that people need to sell real estate. People need to buy real estate. There's fundamental stuff that's happening that means they need to buy it. And if you're just talking to your network and they don't need to buy or sell real estate right now, that means you need to add something into what you're doing to find the people that are and you may need to go into other territories. And then the discourse that we teach add to 360, there's four ways that agents make money. They make money via networking with their sphere. They make money via prospecting specific targeted opportunities. Expires, cancel withdrawals for sale by owners. People that tried to sell their homes two or three years ago. And that's a great if I was in business today, I'd pull a list to see, hey, we were people that tried to sell, we're not able to and go back to that list because things changed, life changes, lead generation, paying for leads and increase in opportunities. There's a lot of pay at close companies right now that are doing well. And last is marketing and brand and building a local becoming a local market expert really. Sucking up all of an opportunity because you're the best in a particular area. Those are the four fundamental ways. So I would say if the way you're doing isn't working right now, if you're an agent's primarily dependent on your sphere, which is most agents are dependent on their sphere, then that you have two options. You can grow your sphere by investing time in your community and networking, or you can pick one of these other ways. Usually the easiest way to pick in terms of things you have control over and you don't have to spend a much of money on is prospecting is to say, I'm going to go find a list of cancel, bizbo, expired withdrawn, people that tried to sell, we're not able to still need to and go, go generate listings. Right? And that's usually, internet lead generation is great if you find pay at close companies, there's a lot of them that are recommended. We keep a list that you can receive referral leads from. So I'd be looking at those and saying, if you have money to spend and you can spend it great, if you don't then do pay at close companies. And then marketing and brand right now is when you're actually establishing, you can use this time to establish yourself as an expert with an area because most people are getting out. That's a bit, I think that's where the long-term play. But by the way, if you're going to be in the business in five years, worth a while to say, look, I'm really going to focus on these neighborhoods or these areas and use this time to build my reputation there by taking listings there. The other piece is we have to get really good with the conversation with the seller. What's going to get buyers off the sidelines is well priced quality properties. Right? So those, and again, coming through the whole COVID nonsense, there's people in this industry have never had a price reduction conversation. I've never set the seller's expectations. We had a lot of those in our company during the GFC. So that is something we have to get really good at about saying, look, here's the reality of the buyers. The buyers in the market don't have a lot of money and they're being forced into high interest rates, which by the way, we're going to be persistent. Those high interest rates are not everybody's talking about like somebody's going to wave a magic one out. Some magic, a little 200 basis points down. That's not how this works people. That's the government keeps borrowing money into the bond market. Mortgage rates are going to stay high. That's what it is. That's not even, you could change the rate. The Fed could change the rate all day long, but if the investors can get a better rate by buying bonds from the government, why are they going to buy a mortgage backed thing? They're not. So the mortgages are going to be driven by the bond market. There's no magic tricks there. But you have to get really good about talking about that with your sellers and getting properties priced appropriately, which is going to be lower so that you can get some buyers off the sideline because that's when buyers are going to move. They're going to go, you know what? I can actually afford that now. It's a follow-up product. So we have to get good at those skills. That's what I would be doing in the market situation right now. There's a lot of tactics. There's a lot of little mechanics in there, but that's the kind of stuff I think about. I'm hearing a lot of pickup market share this year, over the next 12 months. This is a year to pick up market share and realize, too, that a lot of agents, the vast majority of agents are not single career agents. So there is a lot of opportunity, I think, to begin to demonstrate more value over a long-term period. And the good news, as we said earlier, is it's not a crowded road. There's lots of ways to do it. It's not just an email newsletter once a month. We should also mention that nobody wants to read your newsletter. Do something different. I always tell people, get weird. Do something that will stand out. You know, have a great holiday party that is memorable. You know, ran out of movie theater and invite everybody in your database. Do some weird stuff. You know, if you can't afford that, do it in your backyard with a screen. You know, whatever. Do something to connect with your community, connect with people that know you and get creative and do something different right now. And now it's a great time. The creative energy, I think, shows up the most in a market like this, where you just have to get creative, because you don't have much money to throw around. Right. I wanted to ask you to, do you think, so we have a good percentage of homeowners in this country that have a 3% or less current rate, or around 3 to 4%. Do we see that? Is that going to extend the amount of time that these homeowners are staying in these properties simply because they don't want to upgrade and have to pay a higher rate? I know I'm in that situation a bit where it's psychologically and just financially a difficult sort of thing to consider. How hamstrung are these homeowners who, you know, refied to the best possible rate they'll ever see in their lifetime? And then, you know, that... It's a great question. I think all of us that, like my wife and I own some investment rental properties, and I would sell them today, if I knew that if I market situation was different, we are in a house, fortunately, we bought a house right before the pandemic, and we're in one of those super, you know, sub-3% type of situations. And I don't think you can talk people out of their rate. Yeah, so I think that's a waste of time. I really do. But what I will say is what we should be finally attuned to are the life situations that cause people to want to move regardless of that. Because ultimately, people don't live and die by their work, like to check their right for the mortgage every day. It is about how close am I to where I work now? Do I now have... I've gotten two more kids since the beginning of the pandemic. I've got to put them somewhere. I don't like my living situation. So those are the things that will cost people to say, you know what, it's more important to me that I keep that household happy, that I'm happy and not miserable, and I'm in the place I need to be than it is what dollars a month or what the rate is. Everybody got into this whole competing on rates thing, and we're just going to have to get over that because we're not going to see low rates for a long time. So I think just being finally attuned to that, to what life is, and life puts pressure on people to buy or sell real estate, and that pressure will build up, it will build up, it will build up, it will build up, and finally one day they're going to go, I don't care that I got a great rate. I need two more bedrooms or I'm going to go crazy, right? Or I got a job and it's on the whole other end of the universe, and I'm tired of driving an hour or two in an hour from them, okay? We've got to move. Or my kid is now at this age, I want him in that school district, and I'm done, and that's the thing to be attuned to right now, because that's going to build up, because we're not, even if we could wave a match one and make that change the rate, it wouldn't impact anything. We got an economic issue there with just the nature of the lending and the bond market and the mortgage market. We can't control any of that, but what we can do is we can pay attention to our clients. And I think too, it's a great opportunity to partner up with life event service partners, such as estate planning attorneys, divorce attorneys, accountants, people that are aware of maybe their clients' needs, their life event needs, in relation to their financial health, and can actually say, you know, now's a good time to move, or you have to move. I've got a good REALTOR that I trust, you know, that I want to introduce you to. If it was me, I would be looking, I mean, look, as unfortunate as this is to say, I think that the divorce rate currently is around 57% of all marriages that have come up post-pandemic, I believe. I believe that's accurate or close to it. Yeah, the pandemic put a dollar room with somebody that we might not like. Either accelerated intimacy or it blew it up. So anyway, the reality of it is we just have a lot of divorces, and so this is a huge opportunity, people who are getting divorced, they have to move. Somebody's going to move most likely in every scenario. So this is a great opportunity to really think about life events. You know, those people have to move at a certain time, and again, probably beating a horse at this point with that, but great opportunity there. Yeah, yeah. But yeah, if you're not doing the business you want to do, then you need to add something or change something. And you know, it's getting a four-fronted always I talked about, you know, rewind the tape, go back, and then we have a lot of material on that at our company. You know, we talked about that all the time. One last question I have, Jack Ferry, because I know you're a busy guy and you've already spent a tremendous amount of time with us. I wanted to just talk about this and get your thoughts about it, which is, this is in your report, which really, it's always funny to me when I see this in a report because it's something that we bring up all the time, and it doesn't seem to really change much, which is that the number of hours somebody needs to embark on to become a real estate professional is really out of alignment with other industries who have much less at stake for those services, right? So, you know, my here in Illinois, if you want to cut hair, if you want to be a, you know, whatever, you know, Cosmitalogy or whatever that's called. Cosmitalogy, if you want to be a cosmologist, you have to do 1500 hours of actual like working with clients before it takes years. And so we know that in Illinois, we used to have to become a real estate license. We called them brokers here, but real estate agent essentially used to have to do 90 hours. Now it's 75 hours. We even produced it. So I'm wondering if you see that changing to help elevate some of the professionalism or you know, we advocated for it in the opportunity report. And I've personally done some work, some consulting work with some states, state associations and lobby for those kinds of changes. And I'd say it's hard, it's a hard road because a lot of states want to keep the regulatory limitations very low. They want to make real estate easy to get into. And that's understood. I understand that from a free market, capitalism perspective, I get it. The reality is we need an agent to be productive in this industry needs more training. They need more mentorship and apprenticeship. And so in working with our clients, that's what we advocate. They'd like you bring agents in. You need to have them really apprentice and set up a program to do that. Some states are making changes there or are requiring more like Texas is I live in Texas. This state requires has been uping its requirements over the last decade and half. I think it now takes 240 hours to get licensed here. It's the most in the country. The renewal requirements are higher here. The broker requirements are going to broker license here. You have to do a certain number of transactions and have it. You can't just go to the broker course and go take the broker licensing and not your broker. You have to actually have done transactions or some requirements around it. And I think those are the kinds of things that are sensible. But this is where I believe the state associations complex are on hold in educating the biggest gap we have is the regulators and the lawmakers in many states do not really understand real estate. And they see it as a they don't they don't understand the mechanisms of our profession and the risks and the cost and the liabilities and all of that. I mean you get a bad haircut. It's fixed in two weeks. You know it's not it's not the end of the world. You go through a bad real estate transaction. You're in a lawsuit, lost time, effort, money, substantial potential damage to people financially or personally where they're in a house. It's unhealthy for them to be in. So it's a lot. And I think this is where we need to do a better job as an industry educating the regulators, educating lawmakers about why our industry may need more more credentialing because of how easy it is to get licensed to come in and do a bunch of stuff. If you're a professional in like construction engineering, in your working at construction firm, you have you know you're building bridges, you're building stuff like that. There's there's there's a level of impact that is reflected by the amount of licensure and being certified as a professional engineer and the contracts required that people have a certain amount of background. And those are the kinds of things that I believe need to come more into real estate. Not so high to make this a I don't want to this should never be an industry that creates barriers. It's impossible for people to join it. But at the same time it needs to reflect the level of responsibility and risk that's involved in real estate transaction for the average risk. So the through line that I heard not just you've talked about in the opportunity to report again the opportunity report.com is where you can download this gosh I don't know is it maybe a hundred page document. Yeah, hundred pages. It's not dense. It's not like it's not like a slow yeah. No, it's it's everybody should go to this the opportunity to report.com this will help not only give you some confidence in what's going on in the industry but also give you some ideas of trends. But the through line as as Jack has said since date since the minute one is value. So I think increasing your value to the to the public is really what agents can work on and can maybe expect to have a successful year if they're work if they're focused on value. Yeah, 100. Well there we got no so I want everybody right now to do a couple of things. One, the opportunity report.com downloads your your free report and it is it is I almost wish that you charge people a dollar for it just so that they would because we know that you know people don't value. People pay for things when they pay for it then they'll like take it a little more seriously. But yeah, it is it is so it is so much it is so it is worth thousands of dollars what you have put out there real seriously and it's amazing.
