[00:01:16] Now, onto our show.
[00:01:30] Hey everyone. This is Erin Helle with the Grow With Me segment. We are talking about business,
[00:01:36] wealth and health. I've got an awesome segment for you today. We are going to do social media.
[00:01:43] Our topic is one hour to a month of social media content for free. Nothing you have to pay for.
[00:01:50] I'm going to teach you how to do this effectively, efficiently and with no cost. But before we do that,
[00:01:56] and before we recap, which is how we usually start, I want to talk to you guys a little bit about me.
[00:02:01] I was just putting my kiddos who are home sick today in the basement and preparing myself for
[00:02:07] this podcast and I realized I haven't really shared too much about myself. So I wanted to take a
[00:02:12] moment to do that. So the five and eight year old girl, they are currently, as I said, home sick,
[00:02:19] hanging out in the basement. I set them up there with a little bit of a bribe and some TV time.
[00:02:25] So I can knock this out. So the mom life is very real to me. I'm also a military spouse. I'm a
[00:02:31] army veteran and my husband is still serving. So we continue to move around the country with him
[00:02:38] and support him in all the ways that we can. And my kids are just these amazing resilient military
[00:02:46] children and I'm so proud of them. This is actually the month of the military child. So we're
[00:02:50] able to do some really cool things to celebrate them and honor their commitment and their service
[00:02:55] because a lot of people don't realize that military kids and military spouses sacrifice a lot too.
[00:03:02] So I want to share that for my other military spouses out there. Hi, see you. I know how hard you
[00:03:07] working. I know how hard it is to balance life and kids. You know, whether you're a mom or a dad,
[00:03:15] it's it's hard. Even if you don't have kids, it's all hard. Work life balance is hard. And that's
[00:03:19] actually why I want to bring to you this topic today because I'm all about being effective and
[00:03:24] efficient in getting things done in the best way possible. So you can be most productive and then
[00:03:30] have the rest of your time to do the things that you want to do. Okay. So before we dive into my one
[00:03:37] hour to a month of social media content, let's just recap the last couple episodes. So the last
[00:03:43] couple episodes we created our value proposition. And I taught you how and where to share it and how
[00:03:48] to use that value proposition to guide your day-to-day activities, guide your social calendar, guide
[00:03:53] your responses, guide how you interact with your clients and your team and your service providers
[00:03:59] and all of those things. And then I challenged you to go to some sort of a networking event where
[00:04:04] you could confidently share your value with someone else and ask them essentially for referrals and
[00:04:11] create a mutually beneficial relationship. So I want to hear how that went for you guys. Please
[00:04:15] reach out. Please send me an email and love to hear from you. Aaron.m.helle.gmail.com. I will respond
[00:04:23] to you. I promise. So shoot me a note. You can also find me all over social media, the Aaron Helle.
[00:04:29] And I just want to know how things are going. I want to know what you're learning from these
[00:04:32] segments. This is episode six. So I want to hear how things are going so far. What topics you
[00:04:38] want to hear about, what you want to focus on. I'm all for it. I'm all yours. So hit me up. Okay.
[00:04:44] All right. So let's dive in. Episode six, one hour to a month of social media content for free.
[00:04:49] Now, there's a lot of ways that you can do social media. You can spend money on all sorts of tools,
[00:04:58] all sorts of apps and things that will do it. I don't necessarily endorse that, especially if you
[00:05:04] are a newer agent or maybe you're not hitting your financial goals yet. You don't want to put
[00:05:09] yourself in the hole to do something that you could do yourself as long as it doesn't take up a ton
[00:05:13] of time and energy. In the system, I'm going to give you, I'm going to share with you today,
[00:05:17] does not take a lot of time and energy. You can spend one hour deliberately planning your social
[00:05:23] media content for an entire month and just put it on autopilot. Okay. So one hour of deep thinking
[00:05:30] and deep work will allow you to put out quality social media content that will allow people to find
[00:05:37] you know what you're about, know what you offer and then more importantly reach back out to you
[00:05:42] so you can help them. Okay. So first thing we're going to talk about is the topic. So for monthly,
[00:05:50] for each month you want to have a topic. You can have more than one, but we're going to focus on one
[00:05:56] topic and I'm going to show you how simple you can make this topic stretch out for the whole month.
[00:06:00] Okay. So come up with your topic. If you can't come up with a topic, just use a bunch of free
[00:06:07] tools that are available to you. So what I did is I just went, I use AI. I just went to chat GPT
[00:06:16] which is free. There's some, there's some AI stuff that you have to pay for, but there's a free
[00:06:21] element of chat GPT. So use it. What I did was just type in to chat GPT social media content
[00:06:29] for REALTORS. It's all I put in there. Okay. And this is what I got back. I'm going to read this
[00:06:35] whole thing to you. It's kind of long, but I'm going to read it just because I want you to see how
[00:06:41] quality this response is and what you can really do with it. So this is what I got when I wrote in,
[00:06:46] I just wrote in the prompt, good content for REALTORS, good social media content for REALTORS.
[00:06:51] This is what I wrote. And this is what it spit out. Creating engaging social media content as a
[00:06:57] REALTOR can help you connect with potential clients and showcase your expertise in the real estate
[00:07:01] industry. Here are some good topics to consider. Number one, property listings. So it lists out 10
[00:07:09] different topics. And then it actually goes on to give you like examples of those topics. So
[00:07:16] number one says property listings. And then it says share photos and videos of your current listings
[00:07:20] highlight and key features and amenities. Use captivating captions to grab attention.
[00:07:26] I'm going to be honest here, nobody really cares about your property listings or your
[00:07:32] closings except for other people in the industry. Your clients for the most part don't. And
[00:07:37] unless you're really, really niche and really focus on a small area, small neighborhood,
[00:07:44] I wouldn't really spend a lot of time sharing your listings in the sense of like check out my new
[00:07:51] listing and just dropping the link. If you're going to share your listings, get more creative about
[00:07:56] it and highlight the things that you love about the property. Highlight the things that are really
[00:08:01] compelling to a buyer. Like maybe your seller is offering some sort of closing costs or a concession
[00:08:09] or maybe they can do a quick close. Whatever is unique about that or the house just has a really,
[00:08:16] really cool feature that you love. And just highlight that. Don't just go on there and say,
[00:08:21] check out my listing because it's kind of a flex. People see that and honestly most people don't
[00:08:26] care. So focus on something that's cool about that listing. Okay.
[00:08:32] Number two is neighborhood spotlights. It says showcase different neighborhoods in your area,
[00:08:37] highlighting local attractions, schools, parks and community events. This helps potential buyers
[00:08:41] get a feel for the area. Number three says home buying tips offer valuable tips and advice for
[00:08:47] home buyers such as how to prepare for the buying process, understanding mortgage options and tips
[00:08:51] for negotiating offers. Number four says home selling tips. Provide tips for sellers on preparing
[00:08:58] their homes for sale, staging techniques and strategies for maximizing their homes appeal to
[00:09:02] potential buyers. Number five behind the scenes. Give your audience a glimpse behind the scenes of
[00:09:07] your real estate business, including photos or videos of property tours, client meetings and team
[00:09:11] activities. Number six client testimonials. Share testimonials and success stories from satisfied
[00:09:17] clients. This helps both trust and credibility with potential clients. Market updates, keep your
[00:09:22] audience informed about the local real estate market with updates and housing trends, market statistics
[00:09:27] and forecasts. DIY home improvement. Share do it yourself home improvement ideas and projects that
[00:09:33] can add value to a property. This could include simple upgrades like painting, landscaping tips or
[00:09:39] staging advice. Q&A sessions. Host live Q&A sessions on social media where you answer common
[00:09:46] questions about buying, selling or investing in real estate. Community involvement. This is number
[00:09:51] 10 highlight your involvement in the community by showcasing charity events, event work,
[00:09:55] or sponsorships of local organizations. So those are 10 topics. This is like 10 months of social
[00:10:03] media content right here that I got from typing five words into chat GBT. Okay. So pick one of these
[00:10:10] things or pick the topic that you want to focus on that's most resonating with you or most relevance
[00:10:16] your business right now. For the purposes of this, we're going to choose the topic of home buying
[00:10:21] tips. That's what we're going to use going for it so I can show you this system. So step one is to
[00:10:26] figure out your topic. Our topic is now home buying tips. So the next thing that you're going to do,
[00:10:32] oh, before I actually go on, I want to read one more part of the AI, the response I got from AI,
[00:10:37] which I thought was kind of cool. It says remember to mix up your content to keep your audience
[00:10:42] engaged and provide value to your followers. Additionally, use high quality visuals and interactive
[00:10:47] elements like polls or quizzes to increase engagement. So I thought that was cool and that's a really
[00:10:52] great tip. You want to use a variety, you want to be high quality and you want to make sure that
[00:10:56] you're getting your audience to engage, which we'll talk about here very specifically with every single
[00:11:01] post. Okay. So once you have an idea figured out, which we're going with home buying tips,
[00:11:08] you are going to figure out specifically how people are looking for that. So go over to Google
[00:11:15] and just start typing in the search bar what your topic is and see what automatically populates
[00:11:22] because that's going to show you what people are searching for. So I wrote home buying tea and
[00:11:29] this is what came up. This is an actual screenshot of the Google search. So it came up the first
[00:11:36] thing was home buying tips and tricks, home buying tips for first home buyers. Home buying tips
[00:11:42] images, home buying tips real estate, home buying tips for teachers, home buying tips from REALTORS,
[00:11:48] home buying tips for homeowners, home buying tips negotiating, home buying tips blog, home buying
[00:11:53] tips for first time buyers. So the things that blows into me here is just this tipos and tricks
[00:11:59] and first time. There's two, there's two references for first time. So those are things you
[00:12:06] want to think about, you want to think about how people are looking at this stuff and what
[00:12:09] they're looking for specifically. And just a simple search in Google can show you that.
[00:12:14] So use these prompts as like topics, as talking points, as specific verbiage when you are
[00:12:22] writing your content, especially if you're writing like a blog post or if you're doing
[00:12:28] YouTube. This is what search engine optimization is based on. It's the keywords that you use
[00:12:35] to build out your content. And when people search things that align with your keywords,
[00:12:41] your stuff is going to show up. There's tons and tons of SEO tools. Most of them cost money,
[00:12:47] so we don't have to go into that yet. But the important part here is to realize how people are
[00:12:53] searching for your particular topic, so you can make sure that you're focused. Okay, so use Google,
[00:12:59] then go over to Instagram and type in the hashtag. See what hashtag people are using. So I put in
[00:13:07] hashtag home hashtag home by be why that's as far as I got and I got a bunch of hashtags that came
[00:13:14] up. So these include hashtag home buyers, hashtag home buying, hashtag hashtag home buyer,
[00:13:20] hashtag home buying tips, hashtag home buyer tips, hashtag home buying process 101. The cool thing
[00:13:28] about Instagram is it tells you how many posts are using these hashtags. And so
[00:13:36] so you want to start with the one number of posts and look at those posts, see what they're talking
[00:13:42] about. The better idea of what content is happening there and see what people are engaging with
[00:13:47] and how. Okay, I just went a couple minutes doing that. Super easy way to get, um, get a look at the
[00:13:54] market. Okay. Or get a look at the current content that's out there. So once you do that,
[00:14:01] you have this really good idea. I want you to print out a or print out or just write out, have this
[00:14:08] right here. If you're not watching, that's okay. I'm gonna tell you what I did. I basically just made
[00:14:12] a grid on a piece of paper. And on the left hand column, I wrote the weeks and on the right hand side,
[00:14:19] I wrote the days of the week. Now, I only put Monday through Friday content. I don't schedule
[00:14:26] content on the weekends just because the last time I checked, there was a lot less engagement on
[00:14:31] the weekends. Um, timing your posts is important and so is, uh, like time of day and time of during
[00:14:39] the week is important. And you can research that for free. Just Google, like, when is the best time
[00:14:44] to post on Facebook? One is the best time to post on Instagram. And if you hit those critical times,
[00:14:49] you'll probably get significantly more engagement. Okay. So the next step is now you have your topic,
[00:14:55] you have an idea of what people are searching for, how they're searching for it, and how people
[00:14:58] are engaging with that content, what content they're engaging with. You're going to start listing out
[00:15:04] your, your calendar. So the way that I do it is I first come up with a general outline. So in this
[00:15:13] situation, what I would do is I would do my top six tips for home buyers or maybe it's for first time
[00:15:19] home buyers. And you're going to write this script. So you're going to start with a little blurb about
[00:15:25] why this is important. Why is it important to buy a home or why is it important to follow these tips?
[00:15:30] Get really specific on this and then go into your tips, write them out one through six,
[00:15:35] spell them out. Just like the um responses from chat GPT, go in there, get the topic and then
[00:15:43] get more specific in what that tip is or does or means. Okay. So you know if you're saying don't just say
[00:15:51] tip number two, find a good REALTOR. Say tip number two, find a good REALTOR. Then you say it's
[00:15:57] important to find a good REALTOR because a REALTOR can help you understand your market. They can help
[00:16:01] you with the team that you're going to need. They can help you find lenders. They can help you find
[00:16:06] title companies, closing companies. They can help you find inspectors, um spell it out specifically.
[00:16:11] And it's an in depth as you need to for that specific tip. Okay.
[00:16:17] Then when you're done close it out with a call to action. This is the most important part.
[00:16:21] Make sure that there's a call to action with your script. Maybe this is, hey my team can help with
[00:16:27] this or maybe it's um a team specializes in this or I'd love to help. Then you have to have
[00:16:33] an action for them to take, shoot me a DM or fill out this questionnaire or go to this website or
[00:16:39] send me an email. Make it compelling enough to make them do what you're asking them to do.
[00:16:44] Make sure it's simple and straightforward so they understand it. Okay. So now that you have this,
[00:16:48] you can go back to your calendar and you are going to build out a concepts and essentially a
[00:16:57] timeline for when you're going to post this stuff. So what I did was I did post every other day
[00:17:02] Monday through Friday on this particular topic. So Monday of the first week, I did home-bind
[00:17:08] tips and I decided to make a real of it. So what I'm going to do is create still photos of
[00:17:14] the entire process. I'm going to put the first graphic that I'm going to make on Canva for free
[00:17:20] is going to say my home-minding tips for 2024 or whatever, you know, whatever your topic is.
[00:17:27] And then the next one is going to say why it's important, why this topic is important. Home-buyer tips
[00:17:32] is important because buying your house is a very daunting. It can be daunting. It can be scary.
[00:17:37] It can be intimidating, but I'm going to give you these tips to show you how to make it easier.
[00:17:42] And then the next one's going to be tip one with an explanation and then tip two with an explanation,
[00:17:47] tip three, tip four, tip five, and tip six. And then I'm going to close it out with here's how I can
[00:17:52] help you do the thing I'm teaching you home-buying, right? My team can help you buy a home. I can help
[00:17:59] you buy a home. All you have to do is send me a DM, send me an email, fill out this questionnaire,
[00:18:04] whatever it is, whatever your call the action is, okay? So that's what my initial real is going to be.
[00:18:09] It's going to be like a big picture of the whole thing. Then I'm going to skip Tuesday and on Wednesday,
[00:18:14] I'm going to explore tip one. I'm going to go really into depth about tip one. I'm going to make a whole
[00:18:19] post about that. Friday of that week, I'm going to explore tip two. The following Tuesday, I'm going to
[00:18:26] explore tip three, the following Thursday I'll explore tip four, fast forward to Monday of week three,
[00:18:32] and I'm going to explore tip five. And then that Wednesday I'll explore tip six. That Friday,
[00:18:38] the last day of week three, I'm going to do a live, and I'm going to go over all the tips, I'm going to
[00:18:42] recap, and I'm going to ask people, what did you think? What did you learn? What did you love about this?
[00:18:48] What didn't you love about it? And oh, by the way, is there something else you want to hear about?
[00:18:51] Because I'm about to lay out my calendar for next month. So just get really, really, really honest,
[00:18:56] ask them for their feedback, build a relationship with your listeners. And then the next week,
[00:19:02] I'm going to do on that Tuesday, I'm going to say, check out my guide. This is my home buyer guide,
[00:19:06] and I'm just going to take all the things I've already made and make it into one PDF,
[00:19:11] like a single page printout for how to buy your first house, how to buy a house, your home buying
[00:19:17] tips. At the bottom of it, it's going to have my picture, my face on it, and my tagline,
[00:19:22] or maybe my value proposition, my mission statement, whatever makes it clear to your user,
[00:19:29] your potential buyer, what it is that you offer. And then that Thursday, which is like the last day
[00:19:36] of that fourth week, I'm just going to do a, how can I help you? Like I've shared all these home
[00:19:43] buying tips, what are you still struggling with? What can I help you with? Okay, so that's the general
[00:19:48] calendar. And then what you're going to do in the off time, your white space, you're going to do
[00:19:55] more personal things. You're going to add things about you and your everyday life, while still
[00:20:02] focusing on a REALTOR, REALTOR life, I'm not encouraging you to like share your deepest
[00:20:06] darkest secrets. I know that can be hard on social media for some people, but you don't have to do
[00:20:11] that. Just, you know, share your day to day, share things that you're dealing with, share stuff
[00:20:15] that's funny. Like I walked into this house and I found this like super bananas thing, like just,
[00:20:20] it's just funny. You want people to engage with. And just remember your goal is to make sure that
[00:20:24] when they see you on social media, they think, Aaron, Haley, real estate, they want them to always
[00:20:29] make that connection so that when they're ready to buy or sell, or they hear somebody who's ready
[00:20:33] to buy or sell, they immediately think of you and they're going to send you a referral or call
[00:20:37] you first. So you just want to stay first and foremost with them. So now that you have your calendar,
[00:20:45] you need to make sure that each of your posts has that very specific call to action embedded into it.
[00:20:52] Okay, so building this whole thing out takes about 30 minutes, but you can then go and
[00:20:57] create the content that I just talked about. I talked about like that's still real and that one
[00:21:03] thing that you're going to make in Canva, you just have to make one graphic that's on brand.
[00:21:09] And you know, maybe put your face in the corner and your, your Instagram handle,
[00:21:15] plus your value proposition or your tagline. And then you're just going to recreate that for
[00:21:22] each subsequent graphic. And then you're going to use those graphics for all of these posts
[00:21:28] throughout the entire month. Okay. So make sure that you're adding hashtags and tagging the
[00:21:35] appropriate people and accounts as you work on this. And then my last big tip before you
[00:21:42] actually do this posting is to spend 10 minutes engaging the top posts with your hashtags. Okay, so
[00:21:51] before you post each day, if possible, this isn't necessary, but it's a cool tool. You can either,
[00:21:57] you can go ahead and schedule these, you can use meta, there's different ways you can schedule
[00:22:01] posts for free. You can go and create reels and Instagram and just leave them on and drafts. And then
[00:22:07] when it's the day is right for you to post it, all you do is hit post. It takes two minutes. I just
[00:22:11] sit at this morning. But you can also just post them every single day, like schedule time for you to
[00:22:20] post them. And before you do that, engage with all the other hashtags, the hashtags that you're
[00:22:26] using, engage with the top content. And make sure this is in your brand. Like if your brand is
[00:22:32] positive and encouraging, get out there and say like, I love this. This is great. Good for you. Way
[00:22:37] to go. Like be really on brand with your responses. Get people to start recognizing your name. Look
[00:22:44] for the people that are commenting consistently. You've started to see the same names over and over again.
[00:22:48] Comment on their comments. And then you can also say, Hey, check out my page. I got a cool tip like
[00:22:54] this too. Feel free to do that. It's just free publicity. And then when you post, you're driving
[00:23:00] more traffic to your post. So that's it. It is that simple. One hour to social media content for an
[00:23:08] entire month, use the system, create a system that works for you, make it your own and replicate it.

Now, onto our show. Hey everyone. This is Erin Helle with the Grow With Me segment. We are talking about business, wealth and health. I've got an awesome segment for you today. We are going to do social media. Our topic is one hour to a month of social media content for free. Nothing you have to pay for. I'm going to teach you how to do this effectively, efficiently and with no cost. But before we do that, and before we recap, which is how we usually start, I want to talk to you guys a little bit about me. I was just putting my kiddos who are home sick today in the basement and preparing myself for this podcast and I realized I haven't really shared too much about myself. So I wanted to take a moment to do that. So the five and eight year old girl, they are currently, as I said, home sick, hanging out in the basement. I set them up there with a little bit of a bribe and some TV time. So I can knock this out. So the mom life is very real to me. I'm also a military spouse. I'm a army veteran and my husband is still serving. So we continue to move around the country with him and support him in all the ways that we can. And my kids are just these amazing resilient military children and I'm so proud of them. This is actually the month of the military child. So we're able to do some really cool things to celebrate them and honor their commitment and their service because a lot of people don't realize that military kids and military spouses sacrifice a lot too. So I want to share that for my other military spouses out there. Hi, see you. I know how hard you working. I know how hard it is to balance life and kids. You know, whether you're a mom or a dad, it's it's hard. Even if you don't have kids, it's all hard. Work life balance is hard. And that's actually why I want to bring to you this topic today because I'm all about being effective and efficient in getting things done in the best way possible. So you can be most productive and then have the rest of your time to do the things that you want to do. Okay. So before we dive into my one hour to a month of social media content, let's just recap the last couple episodes. So the last couple episodes we created our value proposition. And I taught you how and where to share it and how to use that value proposition to guide your day-to-day activities, guide your social calendar, guide your responses, guide how you interact with your clients and your team and your service providers and all of those things. And then I challenged you to go to some sort of a networking event where you could confidently share your value with someone else and ask them essentially for referrals and create a mutually beneficial relationship. So I want to hear how that went for you guys. Please reach out. Please send me an email and love to hear from you. Aaron.m.helle.gmail.com. I will respond to you. I promise. So shoot me a note. You can also find me all over social media, the Aaron Helle. And I just want to know how things are going. I want to know what you're learning from these segments. This is episode six. So I want to hear how things are going so far. What topics you want to hear about, what you want to focus on. I'm all for it. I'm all yours. So hit me up. Okay. All right. So let's dive in. Episode six, one hour to a month of social media content for free. Now, there's a lot of ways that you can do social media. You can spend money on all sorts of tools, all sorts of apps and things that will do it. I don't necessarily endorse that, especially if you are a newer agent or maybe you're not hitting your financial goals yet. You don't want to put yourself in the hole to do something that you could do yourself as long as it doesn't take up a ton of time and energy. In the system, I'm going to give you, I'm going to share with you today, does not take a lot of time and energy. You can spend one hour deliberately planning your social media content for an entire month and just put it on autopilot. Okay. So one hour of deep thinking and deep work will allow you to put out quality social media content that will allow people to find you know what you're about, know what you offer and then more importantly reach back out to you so you can help them. Okay. So first thing we're going to talk about is the topic. So for monthly, for each month you want to have a topic. You can have more than one, but we're going to focus on one topic and I'm going to show you how simple you can make this topic stretch out for the whole month. Okay. So come up with your topic. If you can't come up with a topic, just use a bunch of free tools that are available to you. So what I did is I just went, I use AI. I just went to chat GPT which is free. There's some, there's some AI stuff that you have to pay for, but there's a free element of chat GPT. So use it. What I did was just type in to chat GPT social media content for REALTORS. It's all I put in there. Okay. And this is what I got back. I'm going to read this whole thing to you. It's kind of long, but I'm going to read it just because I want you to see how quality this response is and what you can really do with it. So this is what I got when I wrote in, I just wrote in the prompt, good content for REALTORS, good social media content for REALTORS. This is what I wrote. And this is what it spit out. Creating engaging social media content as a REALTOR can help you connect with potential clients and showcase your expertise in the real estate industry. Here are some good topics to consider. Number one, property listings. So it lists out 10 different topics. And then it actually goes on to give you like examples of those topics. So number one says property listings. And then it says share photos and videos of your current listings highlight and key features and amenities. Use captivating captions to grab attention. I'm going to be honest here, nobody really cares about your property listings or your closings except for other people in the industry. Your clients for the most part don't. And unless you're really, really niche and really focus on a small area, small neighborhood, I wouldn't really spend a lot of time sharing your listings in the sense of like check out my new listing and just dropping the link. If you're going to share your listings, get more creative about it and highlight the things that you love about the property. Highlight the things that are really compelling to a buyer. Like maybe your seller is offering some sort of closing costs or a concession or maybe they can do a quick close. Whatever is unique about that or the house just has a really, really cool feature that you love. And just highlight that. Don't just go on there and say, check out my listing because it's kind of a flex. People see that and honestly most people don't care. So focus on something that's cool about that listing. Okay. Number two is neighborhood spotlights. It says showcase different neighborhoods in your area, highlighting local attractions, schools, parks and community events. This helps potential buyers get a feel for the area. Number three says home buying tips offer valuable tips and advice for home buyers such as how to prepare for the buying process, understanding mortgage options and tips for negotiating offers. Number four says home selling tips. Provide tips for sellers on preparing their homes for sale, staging techniques and strategies for maximizing their homes appeal to potential buyers. Number five behind the scenes. Give your audience a glimpse behind the scenes of your real estate business, including photos or videos of property tours, client meetings and team activities. Number six client testimonials. Share testimonials and success stories from satisfied clients. This helps both trust and credibility with potential clients. Market updates, keep your audience informed about the local real estate market with updates and housing trends, market statistics and forecasts. DIY home improvement. Share do it yourself home improvement ideas and projects that can add value to a property. This could include simple upgrades like painting, landscaping tips or staging advice. Q&A sessions. Host live Q&A sessions on social media where you answer common questions about buying, selling or investing in real estate. Community involvement. This is number 10 highlight your involvement in the community by showcasing charity events, event work, or sponsorships of local organizations. So those are 10 topics. This is like 10 months of social media content right here that I got from typing five words into chat GBT. Okay. So pick one of these things or pick the topic that you want to focus on that's most resonating with you or most relevance your business right now. For the purposes of this, we're going to choose the topic of home buying tips. That's what we're going to use going for it so I can show you this system. So step one is to figure out your topic. Our topic is now home buying tips. So the next thing that you're going to do, oh, before I actually go on, I want to read one more part of the AI, the response I got from AI, which I thought was kind of cool. It says remember to mix up your content to keep your audience engaged and provide value to your followers. Additionally, use high quality visuals and interactive elements like polls or quizzes to increase engagement. So I thought that was cool and that's a really great tip. You want to use a variety, you want to be high quality and you want to make sure that you're getting your audience to engage, which we'll talk about here very specifically with every single post. Okay. So once you have an idea figured out, which we're going with home buying tips, you are going to figure out specifically how people are looking for that. So go over to Google and just start typing in the search bar what your topic is and see what automatically populates because that's going to show you what people are searching for. So I wrote home buying tea and this is what came up. This is an actual screenshot of the Google search. So it came up the first thing was home buying tips and tricks, home buying tips for first home buyers. Home buying tips images, home buying tips real estate, home buying tips for teachers, home buying tips from REALTORS, home buying tips for homeowners, home buying tips negotiating, home buying tips blog, home buying tips for first time buyers. So the things that blows into me here is just this tipos and tricks and first time. There's two, there's two references for first time. So those are things you want to think about, you want to think about how people are looking at this stuff and what they're looking for specifically. And just a simple search in Google can show you that. So use these prompts as like topics, as talking points, as specific verbiage when you are writing your content, especially if you're writing like a blog post or if you're doing YouTube. This is what search engine optimization is based on. It's the keywords that you use to build out your content. And when people search things that align with your keywords, your stuff is going to show up. There's tons and tons of SEO tools. Most of them cost money, so we don't have to go into that yet. But the important part here is to realize how people are searching for your particular topic, so you can make sure that you're focused. Okay, so use Google, then go over to Instagram and type in the hashtag. See what hashtag people are using. So I put in hashtag home hashtag home by be why that's as far as I got and I got a bunch of hashtags that came up. So these include hashtag home buyers, hashtag home buying, hashtag hashtag home buyer, hashtag home buying tips, hashtag home buyer tips, hashtag home buying process 101. The cool thing about Instagram is it tells you how many posts are using these hashtags. And so so you want to start with the one number of posts and look at those posts, see what they're talking about. The better idea of what content is happening there and see what people are engaging with and how. Okay, I just went a couple minutes doing that. Super easy way to get, um, get a look at the market. Okay. Or get a look at the current content that's out there. So once you do that, you have this really good idea. I want you to print out a or print out or just write out, have this right here. If you're not watching, that's okay. I'm gonna tell you what I did. I basically just made a grid on a piece of paper. And on the left hand column, I wrote the weeks and on the right hand side, I wrote the days of the week. Now, I only put Monday through Friday content. I don't schedule content on the weekends just because the last time I checked, there was a lot less engagement on the weekends. Um, timing your posts is important and so is, uh, like time of day and time of during the week is important. And you can research that for free. Just Google, like, when is the best time to post on Facebook? One is the best time to post on Instagram. And if you hit those critical times, you'll probably get significantly more engagement. Okay. So the next step is now you have your topic, you have an idea of what people are searching for, how they're searching for it, and how people are engaging with that content, what content they're engaging with. You're going to start listing out your, your calendar. So the way that I do it is I first come up with a general outline. So in this situation, what I would do is I would do my top six tips for home buyers or maybe it's for first time home buyers. And you're going to write this script. So you're going to start with a little blurb about why this is important. Why is it important to buy a home or why is it important to follow these tips? Get really specific on this and then go into your tips, write them out one through six, spell them out. Just like the um responses from chat GPT, go in there, get the topic and then get more specific in what that tip is or does or means. Okay. So you know if you're saying don't just say tip number two, find a good REALTOR. Say tip number two, find a good REALTOR. Then you say it's important to find a good REALTOR because a REALTOR can help you understand your market. They can help you with the team that you're going to need. They can help you find lenders. They can help you find title companies, closing companies. They can help you find inspectors, um spell it out specifically. And it's an in depth as you need to for that specific tip. Okay. Then when you're done close it out with a call to action. This is the most important part. Make sure that there's a call to action with your script. Maybe this is, hey my team can help with this or maybe it's um a team specializes in this or I'd love to help. Then you have to have an action for them to take, shoot me a DM or fill out this questionnaire or go to this website or send me an email. Make it compelling enough to make them do what you're asking them to do. Make sure it's simple and straightforward so they understand it. Okay. So now that you have this, you can go back to your calendar and you are going to build out a concepts and essentially a timeline for when you're going to post this stuff. So what I did was I did post every other day Monday through Friday on this particular topic. So Monday of the first week, I did home-bind tips and I decided to make a real of it. So what I'm going to do is create still photos of the entire process. I'm going to put the first graphic that I'm going to make on Canva for free is going to say my home-minding tips for 2024 or whatever, you know, whatever your topic is. And then the next one is going to say why it's important, why this topic is important. Home-buyer tips is important because buying your house is a very daunting. It can be daunting. It can be scary. It can be intimidating, but I'm going to give you these tips to show you how to make it easier. And then the next one's going to be tip one with an explanation and then tip two with an explanation, tip three, tip four, tip five, and tip six. And then I'm going to close it out with here's how I can help you do the thing I'm teaching you home-buying, right? My team can help you buy a home. I can help you buy a home. All you have to do is send me a DM, send me an email, fill out this questionnaire, whatever it is, whatever your call the action is, okay? So that's what my initial real is going to be. It's going to be like a big picture of the whole thing. Then I'm going to skip Tuesday and on Wednesday, I'm going to explore tip one. I'm going to go really into depth about tip one. I'm going to make a whole post about that. Friday of that week, I'm going to explore tip two. The following Tuesday, I'm going to explore tip three, the following Thursday I'll explore tip four, fast forward to Monday of week three, and I'm going to explore tip five. And then that Wednesday I'll explore tip six. That Friday, the last day of week three, I'm going to do a live, and I'm going to go over all the tips, I'm going to recap, and I'm going to ask people, what did you think? What did you learn? What did you love about this? What didn't you love about it? And oh, by the way, is there something else you want to hear about? Because I'm about to lay out my calendar for next month. So just get really, really, really honest, ask them for their feedback, build a relationship with your listeners. And then the next week, I'm going to do on that Tuesday, I'm going to say, check out my guide. This is my home buyer guide, and I'm just going to take all the things I've already made and make it into one PDF, like a single page printout for how to buy your first house, how to buy a house, your home buying tips. At the bottom of it, it's going to have my picture, my face on it, and my tagline, or maybe my value proposition, my mission statement, whatever makes it clear to your user, your potential buyer, what it is that you offer. And then that Thursday, which is like the last day of that fourth week, I'm just going to do a, how can I help you? Like I've shared all these home buying tips, what are you still struggling with? What can I help you with? Okay, so that's the general calendar. And then what you're going to do in the off time, your white space, you're going to do more personal things. You're going to add things about you and your everyday life, while still focusing on a REALTOR, REALTOR life, I'm not encouraging you to like share your deepest darkest secrets. I know that can be hard on social media for some people, but you don't have to do that. Just, you know, share your day to day, share things that you're dealing with, share stuff that's funny. Like I walked into this house and I found this like super bananas thing, like just, it's just funny. You want people to engage with. And just remember your goal is to make sure that when they see you on social media, they think, Aaron, Haley, real estate, they want them to always make that connection so that when they're ready to buy or sell, or they hear somebody who's ready to buy or sell, they immediately think of you and they're going to send you a referral or call you first. So you just want to stay first and foremost with them. So now that you have your calendar, you need to make sure that each of your posts has that very specific call to action embedded into it. Okay, so building this whole thing out takes about 30 minutes, but you can then go and create the content that I just talked about. I talked about like that's still real and that one thing that you're going to make in Canva, you just have to make one graphic that's on brand. And you know, maybe put your face in the corner and your, your Instagram handle, plus your value proposition or your tagline. And then you're just going to recreate that for each subsequent graphic. And then you're going to use those graphics for all of these posts throughout the entire month. Okay. So make sure that you're adding hashtags and tagging the appropriate people and accounts as you work on this. And then my last big tip before you actually do this posting is to spend 10 minutes engaging the top posts with your hashtags. Okay, so before you post each day, if possible, this isn't necessary, but it's a cool tool. You can either, you can go ahead and schedule these, you can use meta, there's different ways you can schedule posts for free. You can go and create reels and Instagram and just leave them on and drafts. And then when it's the day is right for you to post it, all you do is hit post. It takes two minutes. I just sit at this morning. But you can also just post them every single day, like schedule time for you to post them. And before you do that, engage with all the other hashtags, the hashtags that you're using, engage with the top content. And make sure this is in your brand. Like if your brand is positive and encouraging, get out there and say like, I love this. This is great. Good for you. Way to go. Like be really on brand with your responses. Get people to start recognizing your name. Look for the people that are commenting consistently. You've started to see the same names over and over again. Comment on their comments. And then you can also say, Hey, check out my page. I got a cool tip like this too. Feel free to do that. It's just free publicity. And then when you post, you're driving more traffic to your post. So that's it. It is that simple. One hour to social media content for an entire month, use the system, create a system that works for you, make it your own and replicate it. So that's my challenge for you. Remember that I'm all about goals and actions. So your challenge for this week, your action step is to create this calendar and build out 30 days of social media content based on one topic and actually execute it and let me know how it goes. Feel free to tag me too. I will definitely follow you back and comment on your stuff and help you get more engagement too. Awesome. That's it for today. This was Aaron Helly with Grow With Me, Business, wealth and health and I will see you next time.
