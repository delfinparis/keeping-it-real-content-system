[00:01:15] Today's episode is brought to you by corded.io.
[00:01:19] Are you looking for agents to join your brokerage or team?
[00:01:22] Now as a real estate recruiter,
[00:01:24] I can tell you the answer is always yes.
[00:01:27] But most agents aren't looking to move right now.
[00:01:30] So how do you know who to contact?
[00:01:32] Well, what if I were to tell you there's a recruiting
[00:01:34] and retention tool powered by artificial intelligence
[00:01:37] that shows you exactly which agents in your local market
[00:01:40] are looking to leave their brokerage right now
[00:01:43] and which agents at your own firm are also looking to leave you?
[00:01:47] Now, I've been recruiting REALTORS for 15 years
[00:01:50] and I've hired over 2000 agents.
[00:01:52] I can tell you with no exaggeration,
[00:01:55] this is the tool I've been waiting for.
[00:01:57] Corded's AI looks for trends across dozens of variables
[00:02:00] for each agent in your market
[00:02:02] and shows you which agents they believe are likely to move.
[00:02:05] Not only does it do that,
[00:02:07] but corded's AI went and visited my recruiting website
[00:02:10] and read everything I offer.
[00:02:12] So now when I'm recruiting,
[00:02:13] corded's AI tells me exactly what to say
[00:02:16] based on that agent's needs and what my brokerage can offer.
[00:02:19] It even writes emails for me.
[00:02:22] I've never seen anything like it
[00:02:23] and I use it every single day.
[00:02:26] Now, if you are looking to grow your brokerage,
[00:02:29] corded.io is the best tool out there.
[00:02:31] Visit corded.io to schedule a demo again.
[00:02:34] That's corded.io and now onto the show.
[00:02:51] Hello and welcome to Keeping It Real,
[00:02:54] the largest podcast made by real estate agents
[00:02:56] and four real estate agents.
[00:02:58] My name is DJ Paris.
[00:02:59] I'm your guide and host through the show
[00:03:01] and just a moment.
[00:03:02] We're going to be speaking with top real estate coach
[00:03:04] and actually before she was a top real estate coach,
[00:03:06] she ran one of the biggest real estate teams in the country,
[00:03:10] Lauren Duke.
[00:03:10] Before Lauren, I just want to make you aware of something
[00:03:13] you might not know that we have for you.
[00:03:16] So every single day, we are posting short form video content
[00:03:19] on our social media channels.
[00:03:21] These are magic moments from our show
[00:03:23] that designed really to give you a bite-sized tip
[00:03:25] that you can use immediately in your business.

[00:03:36] and watch that.
[00:03:36] And we are also putting on additional content
[00:03:39] that we do not have on the podcast.
[00:03:41] For example, I just published in a video yesterday
[00:03:43] about 10 AI prompts that top real estate agents
[00:03:47] have told me they're using Word for Word
[00:03:48] to grow their business.

[00:04:03] All right, let's get right to it.
[00:04:05] So my conversation with Lauren Duke.
[00:04:17] ["Loren Duke"]
[00:04:21] What's the best piece of advice you've received in real estate?
[00:04:26] It actually did come directly from a real estate advisor
[00:04:31] or anyone in real estate.
[00:04:33] It came from a book called Clockwork by Mike McAllemanns.
[00:04:39] And he pretty much said that if you have a business that
[00:04:44] depends on you, you don't have a business, you have a job.
[00:04:48] And your boss is a psychopath.
[00:04:51] Because if you feel like you need to control everything
[00:04:56] and be in every aspect of the business at all times,
[00:05:00] it's going to be next to impossible to grow.
[00:05:04] Yeah, that's so true.
[00:05:06] And such a splash of cold water for most of us listening,
[00:05:10] you know, when I do just about everything myself too.
[00:05:13] So we'll talk about that in a bit.
[00:05:15] What's the worst piece of advice you've ever got?
[00:05:17] If you want to grow your team or grow your business,
[00:05:21] just hire more agents, just keep hiring people.
[00:05:24] Just bring people in.
[00:05:26] Yeah.
[00:05:27] You don't even need to explain that further
[00:05:29] because anyone who has tried that or attempted
[00:05:33] just to add fresh warm bodies will learn very quickly
[00:05:37] that that is usually not the best course of action.
[00:05:41] Unless that's the plan.
[00:05:43] If the plan is just getting warm bodies in the door
[00:05:46] and there are models that maybe support that.
[00:05:48] But for most agents, that is not a great plan.
[00:05:53] And one that almost all team leads have learned
[00:05:55] at some point is, oh, hiring's like much more difficult.
[00:05:59] That yeah, I love that.
[00:06:01] Well, this is, we're going to have a lot of fun today
[00:06:06] because my guest today is Lauren Duke.
[00:06:10] She is a top real estate coach from CoreOps Collective
[00:06:14] and you can find her on coreopscollective.com.
[00:06:17] Also follow her on Instagram,
[00:06:18] which is also CoreOps Collective.
[00:06:19] We'll have a link to both of those in the show notes.
[00:06:21] But let me tell you more about Lauren.
[00:06:22] So Lauren, Duke is the former COO of a top 10 mega real estate team
[00:06:28] where she helped close to over 3,000 transactions.
[00:06:33] She recruited and trained more than 150 agents
[00:06:35] and launched 21 expansion locations across the United States.
[00:06:40] Those years taught her exactly what it takes to scale
[00:06:43] in this industry and what breaks along the way.
[00:06:46] Today as the founder and CEO of CoreOps Collective,
[00:06:48] she helps real estate agents replace survival mode
[00:06:51] with structure through one-to-one coaching
[00:06:53] and operational development and her strategy to scale program up.
[00:06:58] Now CoreOps is redefining what a successful real estate
[00:07:00] business looks like, one built on systems,
[00:07:04] standards and sustainability.
[00:07:06] Now we don't hear that a lot in one-to-one coaching.
[00:07:09] So I'm glad we are talking to Lauren today.
[00:07:11] Again, CoreOpsCollective.com is where you go to learn
[00:07:14] about all things Lauren.
[00:07:15] Lauren, welcome to the show.
[00:07:16] Thank you so much for having me.
[00:07:18] I am really excited to chat with you
[00:07:20] because you have done it all,
[00:07:22] but let's go all the way back to the beginning.
[00:07:24] So how did you get into real estate?
[00:07:26] So I was a military spouse and we had moved from Italy
[00:07:32] to Tennessee and when we did that,
[00:07:34] I had a nine-month-old baby.
[00:07:36] I, you couldn't have a job when you were in Italy.
[00:07:39] It was against our American agreement to be there, whatever.
[00:07:43] And so I was previously a hairdresser,
[00:07:46] was illegally doing hair out of my house, right?
[00:07:49] But when we moved back, I was like,
[00:07:51] hey, I do not want to have a typical job
[00:07:55] where I have to leave my newborn,
[00:07:57] you know, my son, he was eight months old.
[00:08:00] So I started looking into some options
[00:08:02] and started building up a virtual assistant business.
[00:08:06] And that led to a friend seeing a post on Facebook saying,
[00:08:10] hey, I have a real estate agent
[00:08:13] who's looking for a transaction coordinator.
[00:08:15] And I did a quick Google and I was like,
[00:08:17] how hard could this be?
[00:08:19] Like, surely I could figure this out, right?
[00:08:21] And I did.
[00:08:23] I didn't even have an interview or anything.
[00:08:26] It was just like, oh, you know how to read?
[00:08:30] Let's do this, right?
[00:08:32] And we did it.
[00:08:34] So I started as a TC, was like sweating bullets,
[00:08:38] pressing send on an email for forever.
[00:08:42] And then it kind of came to fruition
[00:08:45] that the agent wanted to start a team.
[00:08:50] And not only did she want to start a team,
[00:08:51] but she wanted to have all of these expansion locations
[00:08:55] and whatnot.
[00:08:56] And I am one of the most figured out people.
[00:09:01] And so that's what we did.
[00:09:02] We figured it out.
[00:09:04] We started in one location with four agents.
[00:09:08] And I think by the time I was there for two months,
[00:09:11] we had one other location open with probably
[00:09:16] double that amount of agents.
[00:09:18] Wow.
[00:09:19] Well, I am a real estate recruiter.
[00:09:21] So all I do is recruit agents for our firm.
[00:09:24] And I will tell you even growing that number of agents
[00:09:27] that quickly with a couple of locations,
[00:09:29] that is remarkable.
[00:09:31] I know how hard it is for me full time
[00:09:34] to recruit 100 plus agents a year.
[00:09:37] And that's literally all I do.
[00:09:38] You were doing more than just recruiting.
[00:09:40] You were also doing all of the opening of offices
[00:09:44] and doing all the structure and operations and everything.
[00:09:49] 
[00:09:49] Admin side of it as well.
[00:09:51] It was.
[00:09:52] If you want to know what not to do,
[00:09:54] that's what we'll talk about.
[00:09:56] Yeah.
[00:09:57] And so you did that and then continued to grow the expansions.
[00:10:01] You guys had over 20 expansions.
[00:10:03] And then tell us sort of how you went from that
[00:10:07] to what you're doing now with coaching.
[00:10:09] Yeah.
[00:10:10] So, you know, we got to a point where the team was very large.
[00:10:16] And I kind of had a little bit of a reset
[00:10:19] where I realized like,
[00:10:20] hey, this isn't really what I meant to be doing.
[00:10:25] My values started to, you know, not align anymore
[00:10:29] with the teams and kind of was just going
[00:10:32] in a different direction than I wanted to go with my life.
[00:10:34] So I actually was, I had my third child at the time.
[00:10:41] And I was eight weeks postpartum and said,
[00:10:46] this isn't for me anymore.
[00:10:47] We're going to go start our own business.
[00:10:49] Me and like we is and me and this little baby.
[00:10:52] We're going to go start our own business.
[00:10:54] And, you know, there's got to be more to all of this knowledge
[00:10:59] that I have.
[00:11:00] It shouldn't be so hard for agents to grow their business.
[00:11:04] Let's figure out how to help them.
[00:11:06] Well, you must have seen so many agents have success
[00:11:09] and then others not have success.
[00:11:12] And, you know, also understanding what it takes to scale up a team,
[00:11:16] not just individuals scaling them up,
[00:11:18] but also how do you get them together and working together?
[00:11:21] And that's a whole nother skill set, which we're going to get into.
[00:11:25] So you have this really wide birth of sort of information and knowledge,
[00:11:30] which it's kind of similar to what I've done here,
[00:11:33] which although I haven't done really a lot with expel.
[00:11:36] That's not true.
[00:11:37] We have done we have done expansions and opened up other lines of business.
[00:11:40] But I will tell you it is amazing.
[00:11:43] I look back.
[00:11:44] I've been doing this 14 years now and I think about I now,
[00:11:47] I don't think I will ever open a coaching company
[00:11:51] because I don't think that's the path for me.
[00:11:53] But what I do know is with this podcast and with just being around hundreds
[00:11:57] and hundreds and hundreds are really over 1000,
[00:12:00] several thousand agents now over the all this time.
[00:12:02] It I kind of know what they need to be doing and I've talked to enough successful
[00:12:07] agents and I've seen enough agents fail, you know, and where I know like,
[00:12:10] okay, I think I could do it.
[00:12:12] But thankfully, like I'm happy where I'm at.
[00:12:15] I haven't yet outgrown this and I don't think I ever will.
[00:12:17] But you did and you said, hey, this, this I want to go a different way.
[00:12:20] And I want to give back in a different way.
[00:12:22] And I love that you're working one to one because that is boy,
[00:12:26] I we have over 700 agents here and one to one is great.
[00:12:29] It is.
[00:12:30] It is.
[00:12:31] And not not so much easier, but less complicated.
[00:12:34] And you can really give those individuals that attention that they're probably
[00:12:38] not getting even from their own brokerage.
[00:12:41] So I love the fact that you're coming in and introducing accountability and
[00:12:45] systems and operations and some of these things that really,
[00:12:48] you can't be good at everything individually.
[00:12:50] And you talked about that as, you know, sort of the worst piece of advice,
[00:12:54] or the best piece of advice was don't try to do it all yourself.
[00:12:56] And so getting a coach, I think there's almost every top agent I have on the show has a coach.
[00:13:03] You know, in fact, they probably all do.
[00:13:05] I don't always ask the question, but I'd be shocked if anyone didn't.
[00:13:08] So it is something and I have over 700 episodes here.
[00:13:11] I've talked to a lot of the top agents in the country and, you know,
[00:13:14] they all say that they have coaches.
[00:13:16] So I love the fact that you're doing this.
[00:13:18] Let's talk about coaching itself.
[00:13:20] So right now, I think is a particularly interesting time in the market for agents.
[00:13:25] You know, you have, well, actually rates lending rates have come down recently in the last week or two,
[00:13:31] but they're still much higher than they were years before, but they were at historic lows at that time.
[00:13:36] So we're actually historically not so bad, but there's still a lot of buyers that are kind of like,
[00:13:41] I don't know, that seems high to me.
[00:13:43] So you have buyers who are sitting on the sidelines to some degree.
[00:13:46] You also have sellers sitting on the sidelines because they don't want to give up that 3% mortgage that they refinanced at back in 2021,
[00:13:52] 2022.
[00:13:53] So you just have a lot of, I don't have to move right now.
[00:13:56] And maybe I should and then there's a lot of parts of the country where here in Chicago is a great example.
[00:14:02] We just don't have a ton of inventory.
[00:14:05] And so there's that kind of factoring in as well.
[00:14:07] So I know agents can get frustrated in times like these.
[00:14:10] It's not always the easiest time to grow your business or to scale up your business.
[00:14:15] But I think it probably is a good time to consider building a team when maybe things aren't
[00:14:22] quite as busy.
[00:14:23] And also, you have a lot of sort of dissatisfied agents right now.
[00:14:27] Maybe their brokerage isn't giving them what they need or their current team isn't giving them what they need.
[00:14:31] Or you're like an individual producer and you're like, I'm just trying to do too many things and I need some help.
[00:14:37] So let's talk about, let's talk about teams.
[00:14:40] So when should somebody start to think about, hey, I think I need more help.
[00:14:47] And what level do you usually start recommending that to someone?
[00:14:51] I think that and you're going to be like, hey, this is a cop out answer, right?
[00:14:56] But honestly, you need to know what you want out of life in general in order to be able to answer that.
[00:15:03] Because if you are, you know, let's say we have scenario A, we have agent who is, you know, single, no kids, no like huge commitments that they have other than building their business.
[00:15:19] They may have the desire to work 60, 70 hours a week.
[00:15:23] And that's what they like to do.
[00:15:25] If you were to ask me like, what is my hobby right now?
[00:15:27] I would be like, oh, don't ask me that because it's work. I love working, right?
[00:15:31] But I also have three kids.
[00:15:32] So I'm probably more on this side where like I want to not work 60, 70 hours a week.
[00:15:38] You like your nights and weekends or at least all of them.
[00:15:42] Right. Exactly.
[00:15:42] We have, you know, little league baseball that we manage the team for and I have a two year old.
[00:15:48] So that's enough said.
[00:15:50] But I, you have to know what you want.
[00:15:54] And before you know that, you know, it's hard to say, oh, when you hit this level of production or when you've sold this many units, you know,
[00:16:04] it's when you start to realize that I'm dropping the ball in these important areas in my business because I'm so focused over here.
[00:16:14] That's really when you get to the point of, okay, I need someone to come in and not only help me manage the side that I'm dropping, but also expand on the side that I'm doing well.
[00:16:27] Yeah. So it sounds like the first step is really to have a real serious and honest conversation in audit of your own actions and your own abilities to sort of say, hey, what am I, what am I doing really well?
[00:16:40] Like sort of stand metaphorically naked in front of the mirror and say, what's going really well right now?
[00:16:45] And where am I struggling?
[00:16:47] Where am I just not getting things done?
[00:16:48] And that's not always easy to admit to yourself because for a lot of us, we do so many things as individual agents.
[00:16:55] That we expect ourselves to be good at everything and we expect ourselves to want to make those cold calls or those, you know, follow up calls or the writing those notes or doing the things that they say to do and every real estate, how to grow your business book.
[00:17:12] And yet we can't want to do everything.
[00:17:14] And also, like you said, maybe you have three kids and maybe you're busy and you have like baseball teams to manage and school stuff to go to.
[00:17:22] 
[00:17:23] You're like, you know, there's so much else going on.
[00:17:27] And yeah, if you're a single person in their 20s, yeah, you got more time.
[00:17:31] Yeah, but yeah, there's this thing of like, okay, I should be making my calls.
[00:17:36] Okay, am I? No, do I want to?
[00:17:39] No, I don't.
[00:17:40] Okay.
[00:17:41] Well, you can beat yourself up for not wanting to or we can figure a workaround and the workaround could be, maybe we get some help or maybe we free up some time, right?
[00:17:49] Or maybe we find another form of lead gen that you do like doing, you know what I mean?
[00:17:55] I just attended a training the other day, you would love this.
[00:17:58] And the topic was why to not lean out of your, why to not step outside your comfort zone because, and it wasn't like never step outside your comfort zone, but it said, why stepping outside your comfort zone doesn't always work.
[00:18:14] And it was basically because if you lean into your strengths, like you were saying, find like I, I took Chatted with a woman just the other day.
[00:18:20] And this is a great example.
[00:18:21] She's a Baphini person.
[00:18:23] Baphini is notoriously well known and he's wonderful and great.
[00:18:26] We all love his coaching for talking about Popeyes, saying like you should be stepping, you know, stopping by in person.
[00:18:33] And she's like, I just that freaks me out.
[00:18:35] I love everything else I'm doing, but I don't love doing that.
[00:18:38] She's like, how do I get myself to want to do this?
[00:18:40] I was like, I don't know that you can.
[00:18:41] Like maybe that's just not your thing.
[00:18:44] And you know what?
[00:18:45] If it freaks you out, that's going to show up when you show up.
[00:18:48] And it's going to freak out your comments too.
[00:18:50] Right.
[00:18:51] And if you think you're bothering them, then you're bothering them.
[00:18:53] So don't do that.
[00:18:55] And you know, it's not one size fits all.
[00:18:57] So you're absolutely right.
[00:18:58] It's this having doing this audit, I think, of saying, what's going well?
[00:19:02] Where am I struggling?
[00:19:03] And if I'm being totally honest, what am I just not getting myself to do or to do well?
[00:19:08] And that's where a coach can really step in and say, I notice this thing.
[00:19:13] Let's talk about it.
[00:19:14] And let's go with the systems.
[00:19:16] We actually call it a time audit, where we have our clients, one of the very first things that they do,
[00:19:24] is, you know, like we describe it as you know when you go to the doctor and you're like, oh,
[00:19:28] I just want to lose a little bit of weight.
[00:19:29] And they're like, okay, write down every single thing that you eat for a week.
[00:19:34] Yes.
[00:19:34] We ask you to do that.
[00:19:36] Right.
[00:19:36] Why the way isn't that a humbling experience to either do the food version of that with the doctor?
[00:19:41] We're like, oh my god, I did not know I was eating all of this all throughout the week.
[00:19:46] And this version of this for what you're talking about is I didn't realize I was spending my time
[00:19:51] doing all of these activities that as I look at it now, maybe weren't the best utilization.
[00:19:56] Right.
[00:19:57] Because even just the accountability piece of, you know, you have to tell someone that you're doing
[00:20:04] that, right?
[00:20:04] Like if I had to write down that I go that I went and scrolled on Facebook for 30 minutes,
[00:20:10] last week, instead of doing whatever it was that I was supposed to be doing, like I don't want to,
[00:20:14] I don't want to write that down.
[00:20:15] Sure.
[00:20:15] You don't want to write down, oh, I don't know why I'm losing weight.
[00:20:19] Well, did you have five chocolate truffles this time?
[00:20:20] Right.
[00:20:21] You're all right.
[00:20:22] Right.
[00:20:22] And if you, and if you get to the, I don't know why I'm not losing weight.
[00:20:26] And I look at my food audit and it looks really reasonable, then it's time for me to go to the doctor
[00:20:31] because there may be something else going on that is hormonal or whatever.
[00:20:35] And this is a great example too, that, you know, when we're doing our time audits,
[00:20:40] we do have to be honest.
[00:20:41] We do have to say, you know, I did scroll on Facebook and I wasn't really prospecting.
[00:20:45] I was just kind of, you know, absorbing content and, you know, a little of that's okay.
[00:20:49] Sure.
[00:20:50] Oh, my gosh.
[00:20:51] We all have to be potatoes sometimes.
[00:20:53] Of sure.
[00:20:53] And we all have to know what's an appropriate amount of that and where are we escaping
[00:20:58] something, some of our responsibilities.
[00:21:00] And we all do it.
[00:21:01] It's just human nature.
[00:21:03] It's okay.
[00:21:03] We can admit it.
[00:21:04] I do it.
[00:21:04] You do it.
[00:21:05] We all veg out in ways where we shouldn't.
[00:21:09] That is unhealthy.
[00:21:10] But the first step is the honesty piece is to go, I'm imperfect.
[00:21:14] I'm a human.
[00:21:15] I don't, I don't always do everything.
[00:21:16] And so doing that time audit is, is critical.
[00:21:19] And then also getting someone else to look at it and say, you know, I work with successful
[00:21:23] agents.
[00:21:23] I know what their time audits look like.
[00:21:26] And we can give you some suggestions here.
[00:21:28] Like we can figure this out for you.
[00:21:29] Like you don't have to figure it all out yourself.
[00:21:31] Yeah.
[00:21:31] If you're going and saying, I'm lead generating for six hours every day and I'm making cold
[00:21:36] calls and I'm doing this and I'm, you know, doing all of these things, but I can't get
[00:21:39] a lead.
[00:21:40] If you are lead generating for six hours a day, you can't get a lead.
[00:21:43] That's a conversion problem.
[00:21:45] That's a conversation problem.
[00:21:47] Like that is, that's not a time problem.
[00:21:50] Or you're not being honest because I don't believe you.
[00:21:54] Yeah.
[00:21:54] No, that's the great point.
[00:21:56] We have, we have skills.
[00:21:56] And, you know, that's another thing that we don't think about as much is like, how do
[00:22:02] I increase my skills?
[00:22:04] Like, not just how do I increase the time I put in because you're right.
[00:22:07] I run into this too where I just think, oh, it's just time.
[00:22:10] And if I just put the time in, I'm going to have the success.
[00:22:14] And maybe, maybe if my skill levels to the appropriate degree, but what if I also increased
[00:22:19] my skill along the way?
[00:22:20] And then it wouldn't probably take me as much time, right?
[00:22:23] So there's that like skill piece where you can come in and say, let's figure out, because
[00:22:27] I know other agents do this in a much shorter time frame.
[00:22:30] So let's figure out how we can get you skilled up or.
[00:22:34] Yeah, we actually just had this conversation with my eight year old last night.
[00:22:37] We were like, hey, if you want to be really good on rookies, right?
[00:22:43] Like you have to, we're going to go outside and practice for 20 minutes today.
[00:22:48] And he's going through the motions and he's swinging about with just his wrists.
[00:22:52] And he's like, you know, not even trying to catch the ball.
[00:22:55] That's not going to work.
[00:22:56] You're not going to improve.
[00:22:58] Right.
[00:22:58] You're just wasting the time there, you know, it's the same thing.
[00:23:02] Yeah.
[00:23:03] And so, you know, once we've done this sort of audit of our business, especially things like
[00:23:08] our time, our actions, and, you know, our, first knowing your why, which is kind of the
[00:23:14] most important thing you mentioned is sort of knowing, what do you want?
[00:23:17] Like what do you want your business to look like?
[00:23:19] What do you want your family life to look like?
[00:23:21] What do you want your social life?
[00:23:24] And other things, you know, and sort of figuring that out and then going, okay, how am I spending
[00:23:27] my time?
[00:23:28] Okay, there's some opportunities for improvement here or maybe it's a skill improvement or
[00:23:32] our time improvement or whatever or just strategy improvement.
[00:23:36] Then it's, okay, now we need to get somebody some fresh eyes on this and help generate
[00:23:43] some ideas because the brain that got me to this point probably isn't the same thing
[00:23:49] as the brain that's going to get me to the next level without someone.
[00:23:52] Yeah.
[00:23:52] So, so I think by now at this point, if somebody's going, okay, I've done the audit, I need some
[00:23:57] help on this stuff.
[00:23:59] That's when we can start talking about building a team and it doesn't necessarily have to
[00:24:03] mean I now have other agents I'm working with, right?
[00:24:06] Teams, as you know, as you talk about this a lot, teams could be, hey, I have a transaction
[00:24:11] coordinator.
[00:24:11] I have somebody doing the paperwork for me that is technically a teammate, but I'm still
[00:24:16] the rainmaker.
[00:24:16] I'm still doing, you know, the, you just mean support, you know, we, we have the five pillars
[00:24:23] of business, right?
[00:24:25] And there is your lead gen in marketing.
[00:24:28] There is your operations, your financials, your client experience, and then team.
[00:24:33] Team doesn't have to be an actual like traditional team where you have a buyer, you know, multiple
[00:24:38] buyers agents and listing agents and all of that.
[00:24:41] It could quite literally just mean your very part time admin that does your social media
[00:24:48] graphics.
[00:24:50] 
[00:24:50] You know, it could also mean your partners, vendors, it could be the, you know, divorce
[00:24:57] attorney who you are constantly recommending to clients who are going through that challenge
[00:25:02] and also who is recommending you when somebody is going through that difficult time to say,
[00:25:07] I have a great real estate agent who really understands, you know, what people are going
[00:25:11] through in this scenario.
[00:25:12] And, and, or, or your financial advisor that you're sending business to your insurance
[00:25:16] agent, your accountant, there's lots of people that can be considered the teammates that
[00:25:21] you're passing stuff over to and from and they can help regenerate for you and how cool
[00:25:27] is that?
[00:25:28] I have a client who, her title company actually does her mailers and her pop buys and everything
[00:25:33] like that.
[00:25:34] That's part of the team.
[00:25:35] Yeah, that is, you know, we, I have, we have a title agency here.
[00:25:39] So, I'm a part owner in that and I will tell you, it is so rare when an agent reaches out
[00:25:45] to us and says, Hey, I'm going to do all my business through you guys or I'm going to
[00:25:48] do some of my business.
[00:25:49] Can we do, we, we do a market marketing share on like a mailer, we, we almost never,
[00:25:56] lenders get asked that's as people often think, well, I'm going to ask my lender and that's
[00:25:58] great too.
[00:25:59] But I'm a title company owner.
[00:26:01] I would know people are not asking me for that and we would love to put money into that
[00:26:05] because it's going to generate business for us.
[00:26:07] So, you're right.
[00:26:09] So, teammates can look all sorts of, so we're kind of like changing kind of the paradigm
[00:26:14] of what we're thinking about with a team.
[00:26:16] It doesn't have to mean other agents just yet and it could mean just these peripheral
[00:26:20] characters that either are part time that you're paying or that people that you're transferring
[00:26:25] value back and forth.
[00:26:26] And yeah, I love that.
[00:26:29] So, let's also talk about, I do want to talk about hiring though.
[00:26:34] So yes, we know that we can bring in transaction coordinators, we can bring in virtual assistance,
[00:26:39] we can bring in some of these other players, lenders to really help us.
[00:26:44] And that was a great and I think that those are so underutilized, but we often jump to,
[00:26:48] okay, when I want to actually hire another agent, you hired a lot of agents.
[00:26:52] So, I just want to ask, you know, as somebody, if they are at that level where they're like,
[00:26:58] okay, no, I really do need like another either full-time agent or someone.
[00:27:01] I'm not in the system or someone.
[00:27:03] Yeah, exactly.
[00:27:04] What is it that you think somebody should look for in a team member?
[00:27:11] So what we say is far more important than skill is whether or not they're a culture fit
[00:27:20] for you.
[00:27:22] And again, we're going to circle all the way back to like what's what you want out of life, right?
[00:27:27] That goes into what do you, what are your core values?
[00:27:31] What do you look for in other people in order to have a good, you know, relationship,
[00:27:36] whether that's personal or working or whatever, right?
[00:27:40] If you are going to bring someone into your business, even if they are a showing assistant,
[00:27:45] they are in the extension of you.
[00:27:48] They are meeting your clients, they are talking with people,
[00:27:50] they are showing up online as you and in person as you.
[00:27:54] And so you need to know that they value the same things you do.
[00:27:59] Not down to the tee, right?
[00:28:00] Like we all have our, you know, unique individuality, but like if I were, if I were a real estate agent
[00:28:09] and I wanted a showing assistant, my core values are stability, contribution and creativity.
[00:28:14] And if yours don't resemble mine in some way, shape or form, we probably won't show up
[00:28:21] in the same way and have the same, you know, like we put our client experience first,
[00:28:27] you know, most real estate agents value their relationship with the client over the transaction.
[00:28:32] That's what you need to look for.
[00:28:34] The skill can be taught.
[00:28:36] Yeah, you're absolutely right.
[00:28:38] Skill can be taught.
[00:28:38] And I was just thinking that this advice is so valuable, not just to people looking to build a team,
[00:28:44] but also to join a team is to understand yourself.
[00:28:47] What do I bring to the table and not just what business building opportunities do I bring to the table?
[00:28:52] Yeah, you should have those two, but to think like what are my values?
[00:28:56] What are what's most important to me because my team lead is going to be also a representation of my work.
[00:29:02] And so do is that it is, is it a culture fit?
[00:29:05] I know so often agents look to join teams for Legion.
[00:29:09] And that becomes like this lifeline for them when they're like, I'm just not good at lead generation.
[00:29:14] So I'm going to join a team and it's like, well, that's fine.
[00:29:17] And maybe that will work, but you're going to be dependent on that person.
[00:29:21] If you never want to develop your lead gen skills, and if not great,
[00:29:24] if you just want to stay that way, that's awesome.
[00:29:26] But, you know, that might not be a culture fit.
[00:29:29] That might, they might operate in a way that your right is, is not great,
[00:29:33] but they're your lead sort of generator.
[00:29:35] And so you can't leave as easily.
[00:29:37] So people get into leads.
[00:29:39] I hear teams all the time.
[00:29:40] I hear it so often is I need to get some leads.
[00:29:43] I need to find a team that's giving out leads.
[00:29:44] And it's like, okay, yes, maybe.
[00:29:47] But I think you're right.
[00:29:49] The culture fit is so much more important.
[00:29:51] I mean, anyone can provide leads really.
[00:29:53] Yeah.
[00:29:54] And well, and honestly, they're just looking for the silver bullet in that situation.
[00:29:58] You want to join a team for longevity and to be able to learn how to build a business.
[00:30:06] So that maybe I don't, I mean, I don't think that it's out of the question
[00:30:11] that some people stay with teams forever, right?
[00:30:13] They're definitely are those people.
[00:30:15] But a lot of times you're going to model your own business off of what that team is providing you, right?
[00:30:23] And just like we said, what do you want out of life?
[00:30:27] Sometimes that means you want to start your own.
[00:30:28] And how flattering is it to have someone come learn from you, even if it's just for, you know, five years or whatever.
[00:30:35] But you want to have the same, you know, you want to have the same values or at least similar
[00:30:43] because you won't be showing up in any aspect of your own business or the team's business or anything as authentic.
[00:30:53] Yeah.
[00:30:54] That's a great, really great point.
[00:30:56] Also, I want to talk a little bit about scaling business because, you know, we're talking about getting help,
[00:31:02] whether we're an individual practitioner or whether we're building a team or run a team,
[00:31:07] you know, we're either part of the help or we are looking for people to help us where we're deficient.
[00:31:14] And I mean, deficient, not with the pejorative, just where we're struggling, where we're not naturally inclined to want to do parts of business.
[00:31:22] And, you know, I think a lot about scaling your business.
[00:31:27] And I want to talk a little bit about systems, I guess.
[00:31:30] And you're an operations person, you're a systems person.
[00:31:34] And let's talk about what systems you think are really helpful for agents to consider either building or where they should audit their systems.
[00:31:44] So tell us a little bit about systems.
[00:31:46] Yeah.
[00:31:47] So I mentioned the five pillars before.
[00:31:50] And the, we actually have a course that we like provide to brokerages and big networks and things like that.
[00:31:56] And it's called the five systems that every agent needs and the one that they're missing.
[00:32:01] And so those five pillars are the client experience, lead gen and marketing operations, financials, and, oh my gosh.
[00:32:13] Did I go through all five? Hold on. We did in marketing.
[00:32:17] Client experience operations team support is the one I was missing and financials.
[00:32:23] And the one that they are missing is the integration of all five of them.
[00:32:29] So if even one of those is, you know, missing or loose or you're, you know, you're not tracking your finances or you don't care about what your expenses are, what your overhead is, then the others are going to, you know, be a little bit wobbly.
[00:32:46] And meaning like if you have all of these leads coming in, but you're not tracking where those leads are coming from, you don't know the ROI.
[00:32:56] Right.
[00:32:56] And where to pour your time and effort.
[00:32:59] Or if you don't have accountability for your team and you're giving them leads, but you're not tracking whether or not they're calling them or converting them, then you very well maybe wasting money.
[00:33:13] So if you don't have the integration of all of all five pillars together, then that's the biggest system that you're missing.
[00:33:22] Now, if you wanted to get more granular within like what systems do you actually need set up within each pillar.
[00:33:28] I think that probably everyone will agree if you don't have a CRM automatically nurturing your leads and a lead capture system.
[00:33:39] And just reminding you when to contact clients.
[00:33:41] Right.
[00:33:41] Yeah.
[00:33:42] Just even somewhere where the phone numbers and emails are like even if you don't have a drip campaign set up, there are so many agents that come to me and they're like, oh, I just have everybody, you know, as a contact in my phone.
[00:33:54] And I'm like, what if you lose your phone or you don't have it backed up to the cloud or whatever.
[00:34:00] So just having a CRM and tracking your pipeline, knowing what's coming in and out so you can make good business decisions.
[00:34:09] Yeah, it's building those tracking mechanisms so that we are not having to, it's kind of like why I bring my lunch to work every day.
[00:34:16] It's not because I'm so organized and so healthy and just like on top of things.
[00:34:23] It's because I will make a horrible decision at lunchtime if I have to make that decision in real time.
[00:34:29] I am not going to choose the healthy option most likely because I'll probably have some stress at that point.
[00:34:34] I'll be busy.
[00:34:35] I will just want something easy and fast.
[00:34:37] You'll tap up on Uber Eats and see what can get their acid.
[00:34:41] We all do it.
[00:34:42] Yes.
[00:34:43] And so, and look, and I'm not judging anyone for doing that.
[00:34:45] I just know that if I do that by two o'clock, I'll be fast asleep.
[00:34:49] I'll hear at my desk because I will be eating more than I should have and I will eat things that I should.
[00:34:53] Well, I need learned.
[00:34:54] You've learned.
[00:34:55] I am not to be trusted.
[00:34:56] So I make my meals ahead of time.
[00:34:59] Now, it doesn't make me a genius.
[00:35:00] It just means that I'm honest about my abilities to make decisions in real time.
[00:35:04] And so, you know, having these tracking mechanisms is so important because we can say,
[00:35:09] okay, I didn't make my lunch today, which sometimes happens.
[00:35:12] And then, okay, what did I have for lunch?
[00:35:15] And how did that affect me?
[00:35:16] And maybe, oh, you know, like, I say this a lot on our show,
[00:35:20] but I have a hard time getting up at a certain time in the morning that I'd like to get up at.
[00:35:24] And I would love to say I just do it naturally, but I don't.
[00:35:27] And so I have an accountability person that calls me.
[00:35:30] And I wake up five minutes before she's going to have to call me because I'm so embarrassed
[00:35:34] that she would have to actually call me.
[00:35:36] And that I wake up five minutes beforehand and I message her, I'm like, I'm awake, I'm good, I'm good.
[00:35:41] Because that's what I need to do.
[00:35:43] And it's a little like, I guess it's a little embarrassing.
[00:35:45] I'm not really embarrassed about it anymore.
[00:35:47] But I used to be and I thought, it doesn't matter.
[00:35:50] Just find a system.
[00:35:51] Be honest about it.
[00:35:52] It's the same way, like I cleaned my house before the cleaning company.
[00:35:55] Oh, we all do.
[00:35:56] Yeah.
[00:35:56] 
[00:35:56] Why do we do that?
[00:35:58] But I'm embarrassed to see you all have a lot of work to do.
[00:35:59] If we all just take 10 minutes a day,
[00:36:02] but we don't, or some of us don't.
[00:36:04] And so yeah, it's about this tracking.
[00:36:06] Like, what am I actually achieving?
[00:36:08] Not in my mind.
[00:36:10] What's the fantasy of how I'm supposed to be perfect at everything?
[00:36:13] What am I actually doing and not doing?
[00:36:15] And not to have any sort of judgment around it.
[00:36:17] Just to say like, okay, this gets in the way.
[00:36:20] And you're not naturally that skilled at this.
[00:36:23] And you don't have to be because there's solutions at a coach.
[00:36:26] Like you can actually help you figure out, let's get that off your plate.
[00:36:30] Let's like, you know, and now it's funny.
[00:36:32] Now I'm my girlfriend, who by the way, is a successful attorney.
[00:36:36] Like nobody is more responsible than my girlfriend.
[00:36:39] And nobody is smarter and like is able to just do things.
[00:36:42] And yet she struggles waking up on time.
[00:36:44] So now I have, I call her.
[00:36:45] I actually, it's no big deal.
[00:36:47] But I actually have her accountability partner.
[00:36:49] Yeah.
[00:36:49] for your wake you up.
[00:36:50] So she even needs it.
[00:36:51] And she's like the most effective person I know.
[00:36:54] So it's so funny.
[00:36:55] It's like, but it took a while for her to finally.
[00:36:57] Great example of just being able to get around this judgment.
[00:37:03] She had a lot of judgment around it.
[00:37:04] She's like, no, no, no, I can do it myself.
[00:37:06] And I'm like, well, maybe you can't.
[00:37:07] Like who cares?
[00:37:08] Like I don't think you're deficient.
[00:37:10] And so it's a lot of it is just this,
[00:37:13] can I accept my imperfections?
[00:37:15] And a coach is really good at saying it's okay.
[00:37:18] Like, yeah, struggles.
[00:37:20] Really?
[00:37:20] And so this is what I love.
[00:37:22] Let's talk a little bit about core ops.
[00:37:24] I want to hear about what do you provide?
[00:37:26] What do you do for agents?
[00:37:27] And why should agents consider reaching out to you?
[00:37:30] Yeah.
[00:37:30] Well, first of all, I want to start with
[00:37:34] touching on systems for one more second.
[00:37:36] Sure.
[00:37:36] Because we actually have a pipeline tracker freebie on our website.
[00:37:40] Awesome.
[00:37:40] I just wanted to throw that out there.
[00:37:42] It is just a free Google sheet download.
[00:37:45] It'll take you two seconds, pop right in and track your stuff.
[00:37:49] You can start seeing what's coming into your business.
[00:37:53] But core ops, so we have a couple different programs.
[00:37:57] We have our strategy to scale program
[00:38:00] where we sit down with you in VIP day format.
[00:38:06] We're face to face on Zoom for the whole day.
[00:38:10] And we are going through all five pillars of your business.
[00:38:13] And we're doing a huge audit
[00:38:15] but also strategizing together to say,
[00:38:19] here's where you want to go with everything.
[00:38:21] This is how we're going to get there.
[00:38:23] These are the people we need.
[00:38:24] These are the roles we're going to create.
[00:38:26] These are the lead generation downloads,
[00:38:31] magnets, whatever you want to call them.
[00:38:32] Let's set up your CRM together.
[00:38:34] Let's do all of these things that you are just sitting there
[00:38:38] beating yourself up about that you haven't gotten implemented.
[00:38:42] And so we implement it for you so that you can
[00:38:47] start growing in the direction that you want to grow.
[00:38:50] And then we also have our one-on-one coaching.
[00:38:54] And that is primarily actually for the operations person.
[00:38:58] We are firm believers that you do need that other person
[00:39:04] in order to grow to the heights that you want.
[00:39:06] And so getting your admin trained developed to push them into more of that managerial
[00:39:14] or director type role of the business that you want to grow.
[00:39:20] So we have the one-on-one coaching for that.
[00:39:24] We also have our core ops community,
[00:39:25] which is actually only for operations people.
[00:39:29] And it's a place for us to learn and grow and mastermind together.
[00:39:34] And we're really redefining what the operations role looks like there,
[00:39:39] especially with how many new AI platforms come out
[00:39:44] every other minute.
[00:39:46] You know, we're redefining the ops role through figuring out, okay,
[00:39:51] now that we can take this off of our plate because there's this new AI that costs a 40-sense
[00:39:56] a month or whatever, we can focus on lead generating.
[00:39:59] We can focus on building out our own referral networks to bring in income and things like that.
[00:40:05] So our biggest one for agencies is the Strategy to Scale VIKI Day program.
[00:40:11] But our longevity is, hey, let's develop your admin over time.
[00:40:17] I love that. And I think that's really smart because if we can develop the admin to
[00:40:22] increase their skill set and increase their efficiency, then we can really spend more time doing
[00:40:29] what we do best, which is probably bringing in business or maintaining relationships.
[00:40:35] And doing that because the same skills that are good at selling or marketing are probably
[00:40:43] the brains that are good at doing that are probably not the same brains that are super effective
[00:40:48] at operations or efficiency. And maybe they are. But a lot of us would probably say, well,
[00:40:52] I'm better at one than the other. And one comes much more naturally to me. So if I can offload
[00:40:57] that to, you know, especially like if I'm the person who likes going out and getting business,
[00:41:02] then if I can offload some of the operations to a VC or a VA or a TC or somebody else,
[00:41:11] and maybe another agent even who is good at that stuff and not good at the good thing out
[00:41:15] and good business stuff. But then it's like, how do you train those people? Because if you don't
[00:41:21] have that skill set, you know, you're hiring an operations person, you're hoping that they just
[00:41:25] have what you don't have. And so that's where you come in and you're able to be like, well,
[00:41:29] I'm going to train you too, but I'm going to train the operations team. I want to make sure that
[00:41:34] they know what they're doing because they need to get better and continue to grow. So I love that.
[00:41:38] I think you're the first coach I've ever had that also talks about training the support or training
[00:41:44] the systems teams operations teams. And that's so important. So I love that you have this holistic
[00:41:49] kind of approach where you're going to obviously work with the the rainmaker and then of course
[00:41:54] they're all their support as well and get them up to speed in that boy. That just makes all
[00:42:00] the sense in the world. I suspect you have a bit of a niche there. I love that you have that.
[00:42:05] And we should mention that the website core ops collective has a lot of freebies. So coreops
[00:42:11] collective.com is where you go navigate to the freebies section. You can find that pipeline tracker
[00:42:15] that Lauren was talking about. There's a financial tracker. There's I'm thinking about building a
[00:42:19] team. How do I start? There's all sorts of other tools and resources here. And Lauren is really
[00:42:26] inexperited this right. She was the COO the operations manager of the chief operations person for
[00:42:33] one of the biggest teams in the country with hundreds of agents thousands of transactions.
[00:42:37] And this is what most agents I think I suspect are not great at. I think you know you're probably
[00:42:45] drawn to being an agent more for the person to person skills, the interpersonal stuff. And maybe
[00:42:51] if that's where your natural tendency is then you need somebody like Lauren because she's going to
[00:42:55] help fill in those gaps for those other areas. So I want everybody to visit coreops collective.com.
[00:43:01] I also want you to follow coreops collective on Instagram. Coreops collective is where you find
[00:43:05] that. We'll have a link to that in the show notes. We'll also have a link to Lauren's freebies
[00:43:09] section here in the description so you can get some of those resources and reach out to her.
[00:43:14] Schedule a call. See she can help you figure out where you're struggling. I know for me,
[00:43:19] I need that just as much as anyone and I sit here and I do one thing all day which is recruiting.
[00:43:24] And even though I don't have to run an entire real estate business, I am not good at every part
[00:43:29] of recruiting. I'm just not. It's not I don't want to say good. I'm not particularly naturally skilled
[00:43:34] at parts of recruiting. I don't like picking up the phone and making follow-up calls but that's
[00:43:39] like the most important thing somebody should do in my role. And so I have to figure out work
[00:43:44] around for that and I really need I need coaches and I have a coach and I need to do audits of my
[00:43:49] business. And so Nicole Lauren thank you for reminding me I have a conversation with Nicole
[00:43:55] like right after our calls. I have this whole name on my brain which I apologize for. But Lauren I
[00:44:01] need this just like everyone else and I suspect all of our audience should think about you know
[00:44:07] all athletes have a coach professional athletes the very best athletes to the to any other
[00:44:13] athlete everybody I can't think of an athlete that doesn't have a coach. So it's probably good idea
[00:44:17] to at least have somebody take a look at your business show you where you know you don't have to be
[00:44:22] perfect at an area and do that audit and get some ideas about how to streamline that because systems
[00:44:28] are everything you're a systems person Lauren and I love that I think most coaches aren't always
[00:44:34] systems people they maybe they focus on other types of skill sets but I think systems and structure
[00:44:40] and and and track tracking is something that a lot of agents struggle with I know it because
[00:44:45] we have hundreds of agents here at our own firm and they struggle with it even like you said
[00:44:49] even just using the CRM your firm probably gives you for free is something that a lot of agents just
[00:44:55] don't do. So that's okay if you don't do it it own that acknowledge it and then get somebody
[00:45:01] somebody like Lauren or get Lauren directly or somebody on her team to actually help you figure out
[00:45:05] how to how to set up those systems and you're right with AI in particular chat GBT and some of those
[00:45:11] other resources that are really reasonably priced if not free. I use chat GBT every single day
[00:45:18] to do various things and I actually just made a video so if you go to our YouTube channel I made a
[00:45:23] video with top 10 AI prompts for real estate agents that other top agents have told me they use
[00:45:29] to not just grow their business but help with accountability and systems but what you really do
[00:45:33] need is a coach and Lauren is a great example that reach out to her go to corops collective.com

Now as a real estate recruiter, I can tell you the answer is always yes. But most agents aren't looking to move right now. So how do you know who to contact? Well, what if I were to tell you there's a recruiting and retention tool powered by artificial intelligence that shows you exactly which agents in your local market are looking to leave their brokerage right now and which agents at your own firm are also looking to leave you? Now, I've been recruiting REALTORS for 15 years and I've hired over 2000 agents. I can tell you with no exaggeration, this is the tool I've been waiting for. Corded's AI looks for trends across dozens of variables for each agent in your market and shows you which agents they believe are likely to move. Not only does it do that, but corded's AI went and visited my recruiting website and read everything I offer. So now when I'm recruiting, corded's AI tells me exactly what to say based on that agent's needs and what my brokerage can offer. It even writes emails for me. I've never seen anything like it and I use it every single day. Now, if you are looking to grow your brokerage, corded.io is the best tool out there. Visit corded.io to schedule a demo again. That's corded.io and now onto the show. Hello and welcome to Keeping It Real, the largest podcast made by real estate agents and four real estate agents. My name is DJ Paris. I'm your guide and host through the show and just a moment. We're going to be speaking with top real estate coach and actually before she was a top real estate coach, she ran one of the biggest real estate teams in the country, Lauren Duke. Before Lauren, I just want to make you aware of something you might not know that we have for you. So every single day, we are posting short form video content on our social media channels.

And that's only on our social channels. You can find us on pretty much every single platform we're on Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, TikTok, and YouTube. So just search for Keeping It Real, hit that subscribe button and you'll see that content every single day. All right, let's get right to it. So my conversation with Lauren Duke. ["Loren Duke"] What's the best piece of advice you've received in real estate? It actually did come directly from a real estate advisor or anyone in real estate. It came from a book called Clockwork by Mike McAllemanns. And he pretty much said that if you have a business that depends on you, you don't have a business, you have a job. And your boss is a psychopath. Because if you feel like you need to control everything and be in every aspect of the business at all times, it's going to be next to impossible to grow. Yeah, that's so true. And such a splash of cold water for most of us listening, you know, when I do just about everything myself too. So we'll talk about that in a bit. What's the worst piece of advice you've ever got? If you want to grow your team or grow your business, just hire more agents, just keep hiring people. Just bring people in. Yeah. You don't even need to explain that further because anyone who has tried that or attempted just to add fresh warm bodies will learn very quickly that that is usually not the best course of action. Unless that's the plan. If the plan is just getting warm bodies in the door and there are models that maybe support that. But for most agents, that is not a great plan. And one that almost all team leads have learned at some point is, oh, hiring's like much more difficult. That yeah, I love that. Well, this is, we're going to have a lot of fun today because my guest today is Lauren Duke. She is a top real estate coach from CoreOps Collective and you can find her on coreopscollective.com. Also follow her on Instagram, which is also CoreOps Collective. We'll have a link to both of those in the show notes. But let me tell you more about Lauren. So Lauren, Duke is the former COO of a top 10 mega real estate team where she helped close to over 3,000 transactions. She recruited and trained more than 150 agents and launched 21 expansion locations across the United States. Those years taught her exactly what it takes to scale in this industry and what breaks along the way. Today as the founder and CEO of CoreOps Collective, she helps real estate agents replace survival mode with structure through one-to-one coaching and operational development and her strategy to scale program up. Now CoreOps is redefining what a successful real estate business looks like, one built on systems, standards and sustainability. Now we don't hear that a lot in one-to-one coaching. So I'm glad we are talking to Lauren today. Again, CoreOpsCollective.com is where you go to learn about all things Lauren. Lauren, welcome to the show. Thank you so much for having me. I am really excited to chat with you because you have done it all, but let's go all the way back to the beginning. So how did you get into real estate? So I was a military spouse and we had moved from Italy to Tennessee and when we did that, I had a nine-month-old baby. I, you couldn't have a job when you were in Italy. It was against our American agreement to be there, whatever. And so I was previously a hairdresser, was illegally doing hair out of my house, right? But when we moved back, I was like, hey, I do not want to have a typical job where I have to leave my newborn, you know, my son, he was eight months old. So I started looking into some options and started building up a virtual assistant business. And that led to a friend seeing a post on Facebook saying, hey, I have a real estate agent who's looking for a transaction coordinator. And I did a quick Google and I was like, how hard could this be? Like, surely I could figure this out, right? And I did. I didn't even have an interview or anything. It was just like, oh, you know how to read? Let's do this, right? And we did it. So I started as a TC, was like sweating bullets, pressing send on an email for forever. And then it kind of came to fruition that the agent wanted to start a team. And not only did she want to start a team, but she wanted to have all of these expansion locations and whatnot. And I am one of the most figured out people. And so that's what we did. We figured it out. We started in one location with four agents. And I think by the time I was there for two months, we had one other location open with probably double that amount of agents. Wow. Well, I am a real estate recruiter. So all I do is recruit agents for our firm. And I will tell you even growing that number of agents that quickly with a couple of locations, that is remarkable. I know how hard it is for me full time to recruit 100 plus agents a year. And that's literally all I do. You were doing more than just recruiting. You were also doing all of the opening of offices and doing all the structure and operations and everything. Admin side of it as well. It was. If you want to know what not to do, that's what we'll talk about. Yeah. And so you did that and then continued to grow the expansions. You guys had over 20 expansions. And then tell us sort of how you went from that to what you're doing now with coaching. Yeah. So, you know, we got to a point where the team was very large. And I kind of had a little bit of a reset where I realized like, hey, this isn't really what I meant to be doing. My values started to, you know, not align anymore with the teams and kind of was just going in a different direction than I wanted to go with my life. So I actually was, I had my third child at the time. And I was eight weeks postpartum and said, this isn't for me anymore. We're going to go start our own business. Me and like we is and me and this little baby. We're going to go start our own business. And, you know, there's got to be more to all of this knowledge that I have. It shouldn't be so hard for agents to grow their business. Let's figure out how to help them. Well, you must have seen so many agents have success and then others not have success. And, you know, also understanding what it takes to scale up a team, not just individuals scaling them up, but also how do you get them together and working together? And that's a whole nother skill set, which we're going to get into. So you have this really wide birth of sort of information and knowledge, which it's kind of similar to what I've done here, which although I haven't done really a lot with expel. That's not true. We have done we have done expansions and opened up other lines of business. But I will tell you it is amazing. I look back. I've been doing this 14 years now and I think about I now, I don't think I will ever open a coaching company because I don't think that's the path for me. But what I do know is with this podcast and with just being around hundreds and hundreds and hundreds are really over 1000, several thousand agents now over the all this time. It I kind of know what they need to be doing and I've talked to enough successful agents and I've seen enough agents fail, you know, and where I know like, okay, I think I could do it. But thankfully, like I'm happy where I'm at. I haven't yet outgrown this and I don't think I ever will. But you did and you said, hey, this, this I want to go a different way. And I want to give back in a different way. And I love that you're working one to one because that is boy, I we have over 700 agents here and one to one is great. It is. It is. And not not so much easier, but less complicated. And you can really give those individuals that attention that they're probably not getting even from their own brokerage. So I love the fact that you're coming in and introducing accountability and systems and operations and some of these things that really, you can't be good at everything individually. And you talked about that as, you know, sort of the worst piece of advice, or the best piece of advice was don't try to do it all yourself. And so getting a coach, I think there's almost every top agent I have on the show has a coach. You know, in fact, they probably all do. I don't always ask the question, but I'd be shocked if anyone didn't. So it is something and I have over 700 episodes here. I've talked to a lot of the top agents in the country and, you know, they all say that they have coaches. So I love the fact that you're doing this. Let's talk about coaching itself. So right now, I think is a particularly interesting time in the market for agents. You know, you have, well, actually rates lending rates have come down recently in the last week or two, but they're still much higher than they were years before, but they were at historic lows at that time. So we're actually historically not so bad, but there's still a lot of buyers that are kind of like, I don't know, that seems high to me. So you have buyers who are sitting on the sidelines to some degree. You also have sellers sitting on the sidelines because they don't want to give up that 3% mortgage that they refinanced at back in 2021, 2022. So you just have a lot of, I don't have to move right now. And maybe I should and then there's a lot of parts of the country where here in Chicago is a great example. We just don't have a ton of inventory. And so there's that kind of factoring in as well. So I know agents can get frustrated in times like these. It's not always the easiest time to grow your business or to scale up your business. But I think it probably is a good time to consider building a team when maybe things aren't quite as busy. And also, you have a lot of sort of dissatisfied agents right now. Maybe their brokerage isn't giving them what they need or their current team isn't giving them what they need. Or you're like an individual producer and you're like, I'm just trying to do too many things and I need some help. So let's talk about, let's talk about teams. So when should somebody start to think about, hey, I think I need more help. And what level do you usually start recommending that to someone? I think that and you're going to be like, hey, this is a cop out answer, right? But honestly, you need to know what you want out of life in general in order to be able to answer that. Because if you are, you know, let's say we have scenario A, we have agent who is, you know, single, no kids, no like huge commitments that they have other than building their business. They may have the desire to work 60, 70 hours a week. And that's what they like to do. If you were to ask me like, what is my hobby right now? I would be like, oh, don't ask me that because it's work. I love working, right? But I also have three kids. So I'm probably more on this side where like I want to not work 60, 70 hours a week. You like your nights and weekends or at least all of them. Right. Exactly. We have, you know, little league baseball that we manage the team for and I have a two year old. So that's enough said. But I, you have to know what you want. And before you know that, you know, it's hard to say, oh, when you hit this level of production or when you've sold this many units, you know, it's when you start to realize that I'm dropping the ball in these important areas in my business because I'm so focused over here. That's really when you get to the point of, okay, I need someone to come in and not only help me manage the side that I'm dropping, but also expand on the side that I'm doing well. Yeah. So it sounds like the first step is really to have a real serious and honest conversation in audit of your own actions and your own abilities to sort of say, hey, what am I, what am I doing really well? Like sort of stand metaphorically naked in front of the mirror and say, what's going really well right now? And where am I struggling? Where am I just not getting things done? And that's not always easy to admit to yourself because for a lot of us, we do so many things as individual agents. That we expect ourselves to be good at everything and we expect ourselves to want to make those cold calls or those, you know, follow up calls or the writing those notes or doing the things that they say to do and every real estate, how to grow your business book. And yet we can't want to do everything. And also, like you said, maybe you have three kids and maybe you're busy and you have like baseball teams to manage and school stuff to go to. You're like, you know, there's so much else going on. And yeah, if you're a single person in their 20s, yeah, you got more time. Yeah, but yeah, there's this thing of like, okay, I should be making my calls. Okay, am I? No, do I want to? No, I don't. Okay. Well, you can beat yourself up for not wanting to or we can figure a workaround and the workaround could be, maybe we get some help or maybe we free up some time, right? Or maybe we find another form of lead gen that you do like doing, you know what I mean? I just attended a training the other day, you would love this. And the topic was why to not lean out of your, why to not step outside your comfort zone because, and it wasn't like never step outside your comfort zone, but it said, why stepping outside your comfort zone doesn't always work. And it was basically because if you lean into your strengths, like you were saying, find like I, I took Chatted with a woman just the other day. And this is a great example. She's a Baphini person. Baphini is notoriously well known and he's wonderful and great. We all love his coaching for talking about Popeyes, saying like you should be stepping, you know, stopping by in person. And she's like, I just that freaks me out. I love everything else I'm doing, but I don't love doing that. She's like, how do I get myself to want to do this? I was like, I don't know that you can. Like maybe that's just not your thing. And you know what? If it freaks you out, that's going to show up when you show up. And it's going to freak out your comments too. Right. And if you think you're bothering them, then you're bothering them. So don't do that. And you know, it's not one size fits all. So you're absolutely right. It's this having doing this audit, I think, of saying, what's going well? Where am I struggling? And if I'm being totally honest, what am I just not getting myself to do or to do well? And that's where a coach can really step in and say, I notice this thing. Let's talk about it. And let's go with the systems. We actually call it a time audit, where we have our clients, one of the very first things that they do, is, you know, like we describe it as you know when you go to the doctor and you're like, oh, I just want to lose a little bit of weight. And they're like, okay, write down every single thing that you eat for a week. Yes. We ask you to do that. Right. Why the way isn't that a humbling experience to either do the food version of that with the doctor? We're like, oh my god, I did not know I was eating all of this all throughout the week. And this version of this for what you're talking about is I didn't realize I was spending my time doing all of these activities that as I look at it now, maybe weren't the best utilization. Right. Because even just the accountability piece of, you know, you have to tell someone that you're doing that, right? Like if I had to write down that I go that I went and scrolled on Facebook for 30 minutes, last week, instead of doing whatever it was that I was supposed to be doing, like I don't want to, I don't want to write that down. Sure. You don't want to write down, oh, I don't know why I'm losing weight. Well, did you have five chocolate truffles this time? Right. You're all right. Right. And if you, and if you get to the, I don't know why I'm not losing weight. And I look at my food audit and it looks really reasonable, then it's time for me to go to the doctor because there may be something else going on that is hormonal or whatever. And this is a great example too, that, you know, when we're doing our time audits, we do have to be honest. We do have to say, you know, I did scroll on Facebook and I wasn't really prospecting. I was just kind of, you know, absorbing content and, you know, a little of that's okay. Sure. Oh, my gosh. We all have to be potatoes sometimes. Of sure. And we all have to know what's an appropriate amount of that and where are we escaping something, some of our responsibilities. And we all do it. It's just human nature. It's okay. We can admit it. I do it. You do it. We all veg out in ways where we shouldn't. That is unhealthy. But the first step is the honesty piece is to go, I'm imperfect. I'm a human. I don't, I don't always do everything. And so doing that time audit is, is critical. And then also getting someone else to look at it and say, you know, I work with successful agents. I know what their time audits look like. And we can give you some suggestions here. Like we can figure this out for you. Like you don't have to figure it all out yourself. Yeah. If you're going and saying, I'm lead generating for six hours every day and I'm making cold calls and I'm doing this and I'm, you know, doing all of these things, but I can't get a lead. If you are lead generating for six hours a day, you can't get a lead. That's a conversion problem. That's a conversation problem. Like that is, that's not a time problem. Or you're not being honest because I don't believe you. Yeah. No, that's the great point. We have, we have skills. And, you know, that's another thing that we don't think about as much is like, how do I increase my skills? Like, not just how do I increase the time I put in because you're right. I run into this too where I just think, oh, it's just time. And if I just put the time in, I'm going to have the success. And maybe, maybe if my skill levels to the appropriate degree, but what if I also increased my skill along the way? And then it wouldn't probably take me as much time, right? So there's that like skill piece where you can come in and say, let's figure out, because I know other agents do this in a much shorter time frame. So let's figure out how we can get you skilled up or. Yeah, we actually just had this conversation with my eight year old last night. We were like, hey, if you want to be really good on rookies, right? Like you have to, we're going to go outside and practice for 20 minutes today. And he's going through the motions and he's swinging about with just his wrists. And he's like, you know, not even trying to catch the ball. That's not going to work. You're not going to improve. Right. You're just wasting the time there, you know, it's the same thing. Yeah. And so, you know, once we've done this sort of audit of our business, especially things like our time, our actions, and, you know, our, first knowing your why, which is kind of the most important thing you mentioned is sort of knowing, what do you want? Like what do you want your business to look like? What do you want your family life to look like? What do you want your social life? And other things, you know, and sort of figuring that out and then going, okay, how am I spending my time? Okay, there's some opportunities for improvement here or maybe it's a skill improvement or our time improvement or whatever or just strategy improvement. Then it's, okay, now we need to get somebody some fresh eyes on this and help generate some ideas because the brain that got me to this point probably isn't the same thing as the brain that's going to get me to the next level without someone. Yeah. So, so I think by now at this point, if somebody's going, okay, I've done the audit, I need some help on this stuff. That's when we can start talking about building a team and it doesn't necessarily have to mean I now have other agents I'm working with, right? Teams, as you know, as you talk about this a lot, teams could be, hey, I have a transaction coordinator. I have somebody doing the paperwork for me that is technically a teammate, but I'm still the rainmaker. I'm still doing, you know, the, you just mean support, you know, we, we have the five pillars of business, right? And there is your lead gen in marketing. There is your operations, your financials, your client experience, and then team. Team doesn't have to be an actual like traditional team where you have a buyer, you know, multiple buyers agents and listing agents and all of that. It could quite literally just mean your very part time admin that does your social media graphics. You know, it could also mean your partners, vendors, it could be the, you know, divorce attorney who you are constantly recommending to clients who are going through that challenge and also who is recommending you when somebody is going through that difficult time to say, I have a great real estate agent who really understands, you know, what people are going through in this scenario. And, and, or, or your financial advisor that you're sending business to your insurance agent, your accountant, there's lots of people that can be considered the teammates that you're passing stuff over to and from and they can help regenerate for you and how cool is that? I have a client who, her title company actually does her mailers and her pop buys and everything like that. That's part of the team. Yeah, that is, you know, we, I have, we have a title agency here. So, I'm a part owner in that and I will tell you, it is so rare when an agent reaches out to us and says, Hey, I'm going to do all my business through you guys or I'm going to do some of my business. Can we do, we, we do a market marketing share on like a mailer, we, we almost never, lenders get asked that's as people often think, well, I'm going to ask my lender and that's great too. But I'm a title company owner. I would know people are not asking me for that and we would love to put money into that because it's going to generate business for us. So, you're right. So, teammates can look all sorts of, so we're kind of like changing kind of the paradigm of what we're thinking about with a team. It doesn't have to mean other agents just yet and it could mean just these peripheral characters that either are part time that you're paying or that people that you're transferring value back and forth. And yeah, I love that. So, let's also talk about, I do want to talk about hiring though. So yes, we know that we can bring in transaction coordinators, we can bring in virtual assistance, we can bring in some of these other players, lenders to really help us. And that was a great and I think that those are so underutilized, but we often jump to, okay, when I want to actually hire another agent, you hired a lot of agents. So, I just want to ask, you know, as somebody, if they are at that level where they're like, okay, no, I really do need like another either full-time agent or someone. I'm not in the system or someone. Yeah, exactly. What is it that you think somebody should look for in a team member? So what we say is far more important than skill is whether or not they're a culture fit for you. And again, we're going to circle all the way back to like what's what you want out of life, right? That goes into what do you, what are your core values? What do you look for in other people in order to have a good, you know, relationship, whether that's personal or working or whatever, right? If you are going to bring someone into your business, even if they are a showing assistant, they are in the extension of you. They are meeting your clients, they are talking with people, they are showing up online as you and in person as you. And so you need to know that they value the same things you do. Not down to the tee, right? Like we all have our, you know, unique individuality, but like if I were, if I were a real estate agent and I wanted a showing assistant, my core values are stability, contribution and creativity. And if yours don't resemble mine in some way, shape or form, we probably won't show up in the same way and have the same, you know, like we put our client experience first, you know, most real estate agents value their relationship with the client over the transaction. That's what you need to look for. The skill can be taught. Yeah, you're absolutely right. Skill can be taught. And I was just thinking that this advice is so valuable, not just to people looking to build a team, but also to join a team is to understand yourself. What do I bring to the table and not just what business building opportunities do I bring to the table? Yeah, you should have those two, but to think like what are my values? What are what's most important to me because my team lead is going to be also a representation of my work. And so do is that it is, is it a culture fit? I know so often agents look to join teams for Legion. And that becomes like this lifeline for them when they're like, I'm just not good at lead generation. So I'm going to join a team and it's like, well, that's fine. And maybe that will work, but you're going to be dependent on that person. If you never want to develop your lead gen skills, and if not great, if you just want to stay that way, that's awesome. But, you know, that might not be a culture fit. That might, they might operate in a way that your right is, is not great, but they're your lead sort of generator. And so you can't leave as easily. So people get into leads. I hear teams all the time. I hear it so often is I need to get some leads. I need to find a team that's giving out leads. And it's like, okay, yes, maybe. But I think you're right. The culture fit is so much more important. I mean, anyone can provide leads really. Yeah. And well, and honestly, they're just looking for the silver bullet in that situation. You want to join a team for longevity and to be able to learn how to build a business. So that maybe I don't, I mean, I don't think that it's out of the question that some people stay with teams forever, right? They're definitely are those people. But a lot of times you're going to model your own business off of what that team is providing you, right? And just like we said, what do you want out of life? Sometimes that means you want to start your own. And how flattering is it to have someone come learn from you, even if it's just for, you know, five years or whatever. But you want to have the same, you know, you want to have the same values or at least similar because you won't be showing up in any aspect of your own business or the team's business or anything as authentic. Yeah. That's a great, really great point. Also, I want to talk a little bit about scaling business because, you know, we're talking about getting help, whether we're an individual practitioner or whether we're building a team or run a team, you know, we're either part of the help or we are looking for people to help us where we're deficient. And I mean, deficient, not with the pejorative, just where we're struggling, where we're not naturally inclined to want to do parts of business. And, you know, I think a lot about scaling your business. And I want to talk a little bit about systems, I guess. And you're an operations person, you're a systems person. And let's talk about what systems you think are really helpful for agents to consider either building or where they should audit their systems. So tell us a little bit about systems. Yeah. So I mentioned the five pillars before. And the, we actually have a course that we like provide to brokerages and big networks and things like that. And it's called the five systems that every agent needs and the one that they're missing. And so those five pillars are the client experience, lead gen and marketing operations, financials, and, oh my gosh. Did I go through all five? Hold on. We did in marketing. Client experience operations team support is the one I was missing and financials. And the one that they are missing is the integration of all five of them. So if even one of those is, you know, missing or loose or you're, you know, you're not tracking your finances or you don't care about what your expenses are, what your overhead is, then the others are going to, you know, be a little bit wobbly. And meaning like if you have all of these leads coming in, but you're not tracking where those leads are coming from, you don't know the ROI. Right. And where to pour your time and effort. Or if you don't have accountability for your team and you're giving them leads, but you're not tracking whether or not they're calling them or converting them, then you very well maybe wasting money. So if you don't have the integration of all of all five pillars together, then that's the biggest system that you're missing. Now, if you wanted to get more granular within like what systems do you actually need set up within each pillar. I think that probably everyone will agree if you don't have a CRM automatically nurturing your leads and a lead capture system. And just reminding you when to contact clients. Right. Yeah. Just even somewhere where the phone numbers and emails are like even if you don't have a drip campaign set up, there are so many agents that come to me and they're like, oh, I just have everybody, you know, as a contact in my phone. And I'm like, what if you lose your phone or you don't have it backed up to the cloud or whatever. So just having a CRM and tracking your pipeline, knowing what's coming in and out so you can make good business decisions. Yeah, it's building those tracking mechanisms so that we are not having to, it's kind of like why I bring my lunch to work every day. It's not because I'm so organized and so healthy and just like on top of things. It's because I will make a horrible decision at lunchtime if I have to make that decision in real time. I am not going to choose the healthy option most likely because I'll probably have some stress at that point. I'll be busy. I will just want something easy and fast. You'll tap up on Uber Eats and see what can get their acid. We all do it. Yes. And so, and look, and I'm not judging anyone for doing that. I just know that if I do that by two o'clock, I'll be fast asleep. I'll hear at my desk because I will be eating more than I should have and I will eat things that I should. Well, I need learned. You've learned. I am not to be trusted. So I make my meals ahead of time. Now, it doesn't make me a genius. It just means that I'm honest about my abilities to make decisions in real time. And so, you know, having these tracking mechanisms is so important because we can say, okay, I didn't make my lunch today, which sometimes happens. And then, okay, what did I have for lunch? And how did that affect me? And maybe, oh, you know, like, I say this a lot on our show, but I have a hard time getting up at a certain time in the morning that I'd like to get up at. And I would love to say I just do it naturally, but I don't. And so I have an accountability person that calls me. And I wake up five minutes before she's going to have to call me because I'm so embarrassed that she would have to actually call me. And that I wake up five minutes beforehand and I message her, I'm like, I'm awake, I'm good, I'm good. Because that's what I need to do. And it's a little like, I guess it's a little embarrassing. I'm not really embarrassed about it anymore. But I used to be and I thought, it doesn't matter. Just find a system. Be honest about it. It's the same way, like I cleaned my house before the cleaning company. Oh, we all do. Yeah. Why do we do that? But I'm embarrassed to see you all have a lot of work to do. If we all just take 10 minutes a day, but we don't, or some of us don't. And so yeah, it's about this tracking. Like, what am I actually achieving? Not in my mind. What's the fantasy of how I'm supposed to be perfect at everything? What am I actually doing and not doing? And not to have any sort of judgment around it. Just to say like, okay, this gets in the way. And you're not naturally that skilled at this. And you don't have to be because there's solutions at a coach. Like you can actually help you figure out, let's get that off your plate. Let's like, you know, and now it's funny. Now I'm my girlfriend, who by the way, is a successful attorney. Like nobody is more responsible than my girlfriend. And nobody is smarter and like is able to just do things. And yet she struggles waking up on time. So now I have, I call her. I actually, it's no big deal. But I actually have her accountability partner. Yeah. for your wake you up. So she even needs it. And she's like the most effective person I know. So it's so funny. It's like, but it took a while for her to finally. Great example of just being able to get around this judgment. She had a lot of judgment around it. She's like, no, no, no, I can do it myself. And I'm like, well, maybe you can't. Like who cares? Like I don't think you're deficient. And so it's a lot of it is just this, can I accept my imperfections? And a coach is really good at saying it's okay. Like, yeah, struggles. Really? And so this is what I love. Let's talk a little bit about core ops. I want to hear about what do you provide? What do you do for agents? And why should agents consider reaching out to you? Yeah. Well, first of all, I want to start with touching on systems for one more second. Sure. Because we actually have a pipeline tracker freebie on our website. Awesome. I just wanted to throw that out there. It is just a free Google sheet download. It'll take you two seconds, pop right in and track your stuff. You can start seeing what's coming into your business. But core ops, so we have a couple different programs. We have our strategy to scale program where we sit down with you in VIP day format. We're face to face on Zoom for the whole day. And we are going through all five pillars of your business. And we're doing a huge audit but also strategizing together to say, here's where you want to go with everything. This is how we're going to get there. These are the people we need. These are the roles we're going to create. These are the lead generation downloads, magnets, whatever you want to call them. Let's set up your CRM together. Let's do all of these things that you are just sitting there beating yourself up about that you haven't gotten implemented. And so we implement it for you so that you can start growing in the direction that you want to grow. And then we also have our one-on-one coaching. And that is primarily actually for the operations person. We are firm believers that you do need that other person in order to grow to the heights that you want. And so getting your admin trained developed to push them into more of that managerial or director type role of the business that you want to grow. So we have the one-on-one coaching for that. We also have our core ops community, which is actually only for operations people. And it's a place for us to learn and grow and mastermind together. And we're really redefining what the operations role looks like there, especially with how many new AI platforms come out every other minute. You know, we're redefining the ops role through figuring out, okay, now that we can take this off of our plate because there's this new AI that costs a 40-sense a month or whatever, we can focus on lead generating. We can focus on building out our own referral networks to bring in income and things like that. So our biggest one for agencies is the Strategy to Scale VIKI Day program. But our longevity is, hey, let's develop your admin over time. I love that. And I think that's really smart because if we can develop the admin to increase their skill set and increase their efficiency, then we can really spend more time doing what we do best, which is probably bringing in business or maintaining relationships. And doing that because the same skills that are good at selling or marketing are probably the brains that are good at doing that are probably not the same brains that are super effective at operations or efficiency. And maybe they are. But a lot of us would probably say, well, I'm better at one than the other. And one comes much more naturally to me. So if I can offload that to, you know, especially like if I'm the person who likes going out and getting business, then if I can offload some of the operations to a VC or a VA or a TC or somebody else, and maybe another agent even who is good at that stuff and not good at the good thing out and good business stuff. But then it's like, how do you train those people? Because if you don't have that skill set, you know, you're hiring an operations person, you're hoping that they just have what you don't have. And so that's where you come in and you're able to be like, well, I'm going to train you too, but I'm going to train the operations team. I want to make sure that they know what they're doing because they need to get better and continue to grow. So I love that. I think you're the first coach I've ever had that also talks about training the support or training the systems teams operations teams. And that's so important. So I love that you have this holistic kind of approach where you're going to obviously work with the the rainmaker and then of course they're all their support as well and get them up to speed in that boy. That just makes all the sense in the world. I suspect you have a bit of a niche there. I love that you have that. And we should mention that the website core ops collective has a lot of freebies. So coreops collective.com is where you go navigate to the freebies section. You can find that pipeline tracker that Lauren was talking about. There's a financial tracker. There's I'm thinking about building a team. How do I start? There's all sorts of other tools and resources here. And Lauren is really inexperited this right. She was the COO the operations manager of the chief operations person for one of the biggest teams in the country with hundreds of agents thousands of transactions. And this is what most agents I think I suspect are not great at. I think you know you're probably drawn to being an agent more for the person to person skills, the interpersonal stuff. And maybe if that's where your natural tendency is then you need somebody like Lauren because she's going to help fill in those gaps for those other areas. So I want everybody to visit coreops collective.com. I also want you to follow coreops collective on Instagram. Coreops collective is where you find that. We'll have a link to that in the show notes. We'll also have a link to Lauren's freebies section here in the description so you can get some of those resources and reach out to her. Schedule a call. See she can help you figure out where you're struggling. I know for me, I need that just as much as anyone and I sit here and I do one thing all day which is recruiting. And even though I don't have to run an entire real estate business, I am not good at every part of recruiting. I'm just not. It's not I don't want to say good. I'm not particularly naturally skilled at parts of recruiting. I don't like picking up the phone and making follow-up calls but that's like the most important thing somebody should do in my role. And so I have to figure out work around for that and I really need I need coaches and I have a coach and I need to do audits of my business. And so Nicole Lauren thank you for reminding me I have a conversation with Nicole like right after our calls. I have this whole name on my brain which I apologize for. But Lauren I need this just like everyone else and I suspect all of our audience should think about you know all athletes have a coach professional athletes the very best athletes to the to any other athlete everybody I can't think of an athlete that doesn't have a coach. So it's probably good idea to at least have somebody take a look at your business show you where you know you don't have to be perfect at an area and do that audit and get some ideas about how to streamline that because systems are everything you're a systems person Lauren and I love that I think most coaches aren't always systems people they maybe they focus on other types of skill sets but I think systems and structure and and and track tracking is something that a lot of agents struggle with I know it because we have hundreds of agents here at our own firm and they struggle with it even like you said even just using the CRM your firm probably gives you for free is something that a lot of agents just don't do.
