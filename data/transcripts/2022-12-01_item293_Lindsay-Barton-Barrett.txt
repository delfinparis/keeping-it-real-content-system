[00:04:31] It's awesome. It's elegant. Anyway, Lindsay, welcome to the show. We're so excited to have you.
[00:04:36] Thank you so much. I'm happy to be here.
[00:04:39] We are very happy to Lindsay and I were just talking about some some other things prior to the show, not real estate related. So I am really excited to learn more about your your path and progress and journey through real estate.
[00:04:54] But I'd love to start all the way to beginning because I know in your previous career, you are a real estate attorney as well. But how did you get involved in real estate to begin with?
[00:05:04] I would say probably goes back a little before that I grew up in Seattle and my my dad was a more lots of hats over the years, but was involved in real estate development and construction a little bit at certain points and in the hotel business as well.
[00:05:26] And that just it always interested me because it covers so much ground. It's really personal yet also tangible.
[00:05:36] And so I was I was intrigued by it from an early age, honestly, the construction part of it, all of that. And then I went to law school and I went to Columbia, which is a very traditional law school approach, you know, think paper chase.
[00:05:55] You know, we don't teach you to be a lawyer. We teach you to think like a lawyer. And so it was very theoretical in certain ways. And there was not a lot of specific sort of there was not a there were not a lot of specific classes that related to practice areas necessarily offered, including real estate.
[00:06:20] And maybe there was and maybe I missed it, but I didn't come out knowing that that was what I wanted to do, but I knew that I was interested in real estate. And so I worked as a corporate attorney briefly and when I would do diligence on transactions, you know, M&A transactions or something, I still continue to gravitate to the real estate piece of it.
[00:06:41] So I ended up lateralling between two big firms in Manhattan and moved to another firm where I was in a real estate dedicated practice.
[00:06:53] And I really, I was I loved it. I loved the pieces of the transactions, but I didn't love the role that I was playing in transactions. I, I think there are amazing lawyers, but often a lawyer's job is to pinpoint all the potential pitfalls in a transaction instead of focusing on keeping the job.
[00:07:23] And I was thinking about putting parties together and keeping parties moving forward. And I would work on big transactions where there were both commercial real estate brokers and investment bankers on the deals and just sitting on conference calls or sitting in the room.
[00:07:40] I would look at what they were doing and think that's what I want to be doing. I want to be building things and putting deals together and helping really smart people who know what they want to do get together and do it in in a profitable and, you know, they know what they're doing, you know, our clients really knew what they were doing.
[00:08:01] And so I often felt that the lawyers were just bringing up the same points every single time that had been resolved in the last iteration of this document. And I just didn't, I didn't like the role that I was playing and it may have been a function of being in a big firm versus being at a smaller firm.
[00:08:22] But ultimately I just felt like between not seeing myself as a New York lawyer and the various sort of the various limitations that that can present in terms of hours worked and all of those things.
[00:08:44] I just became clear to me that I wanted something different in my role and in my in my hours and all of that. And so I and then I bought an apartment with a tiny bit of money. I put 5% down, I think, on a condo in the East Village.
[00:09:05] Which by the way, which by the way, 5% down on a condo in the East Village is still a tremendous down payment.
[00:09:13] It was a long time ago, but yes, yes, it was. And so I, you know, I put 5% down, I bought a condo in the East Village and then over the years, you know, and that was one thing that I really that has also been a driver for me of what I do is that I do have a very sort of quintessent.
[00:09:35] I'm not sure if you're going to be able to see the actual real estate escalation story of I bought the condo in the East Village turned around and bought a co up in Cobble Hill turned around and bought a relatively, you know, for the time and for New York inexpensive townhouse that ultimately we got renovated.
[00:09:53] And I sold it this past year for a significant multiple of a the condo in the East Village in 2000, but also what we bought it for.
[00:10:03] So it really and it enabled me to do this job. I was able to take out a home equity line of credit. So I had something to fall back on and so real estate has actually really kind of done for me what I think it does for a lot of people.
[00:10:20] But what I think a lot of people don't really believe happens anymore. So that's sort of my backstory.
[00:10:26] Yeah, and there was really a lot there. I just want to unpack a couple of things. Number one, I want to honor you for the courage to walk away from a legal career that you worked.
[00:10:38] Well, number one, Columbia is not one of the worst law schools in the country. It's actually one of the very top and that I'm sure that's how you of course how you got to New York.
[00:10:48] Did you also do your undergraduate New York as well or did you just end up there for law school?
[00:10:53] I was in upstate New York. I went to Cornell undergrad. So I went to I went to great schools, you know, no complaints here, you know, but it just it it.
[00:11:03] It was a different path, but it brought me to where I am now.
[00:11:07] It's was it difficult to walk away from working so hard to pass the bar and of course work in incorporate, you know, the corporate law world and then to be an MNA activity, mergers and acquisitions and then say, you know, I really this isn't my I don't want to bill, you know, a thousand hours a year anymore or whatever the whatever lawyers are building these days.
[00:11:29] I know it's always a staggering staggering number and sort of trading hours for dollars is really what attorneys do, which is why they work so much.
[00:11:39] Was that any more especially.
[00:11:42] It was hardest for my mom, I would say sure.
[00:11:48] My mom was not happy about the decision.
[00:11:52] What are you doing with your life?
[00:11:54] Yes, yes.
[00:11:56] And I should be really nice to my mom right now. She's not too great, but I she was not happy that I quit my job.
[00:12:04] It was scary. It was definitely scary.
[00:12:06] And you know, it's true, you need a real sort of you need something to fall back on and I genuinely got that exclusively by doing a home equity line of credit before I put my job taking that money and knowing that I had it.
[00:12:25] And then leaving and so it was definitely scary. I felt like I had maybe one client, maybe two, they were sort of friends that graciously trusted me with their home purchase or home search.
[00:12:41] I think one of them ended up buying and one of them didn't and then otherwise I really, you know, I think people look at me and go, oh, you had all these like lawyers lawyers are very conservative.
[00:12:51] I have a lot of law school friends who still rent in New York City and I graduated from law school 23 years ago.
[00:13:02] So, you know, lawyers turned out not to necessarily be my sort of go to client base either. And when I when I left, I knew I didn't really know what I was doing entirely.
[00:13:15] So it was very nervous to try to tap that resource and mess it up.
[00:13:24] And so I didn't sort of dive back into the law firm world to try to get clients because when you first become an agent, your job is getting clients not doing your job.
[00:13:36] So, yeah, so I was nervous. Obviously I had a paycheck and at that point I had a mortgage and but I was excited about it.
[00:13:49] And I felt like I had the cushion and I could give it time and if after six months, it didn't work out.
[00:13:56] So I will move on, but fortunately it did. It did. I landed in a good place. I had a great support system in terms of my manager and people that I worked with.
[00:14:10] And I, you know, I at the time I was engaged and then ultimately my husband was supportive and now he's not my husband anymore.
[00:14:18] And so yeah, I was able to do it. It was scary, but I was really fortunate in kind of I mean, I don't know why managed to hit the ground running and then just build from there and get referrals from the people that I, I worked with.
[00:14:36] How did so since you didn't tap the hey, my friends at the law firm I was at or certainly people who know me in my field.
[00:14:44] As you were saying, because I was thinking, oh, this is so brilliant because she's all of her clients will be the attorney she knows.
[00:14:50] And that turns out, but you you served my question by saying that is not what happened. So I'm actually really interested in and yes, I understand, you know, having this previous career that you'd work so hard for.
[00:15:03] Obviously, you can fall back could have fall back fell back onto that very I'm sure very easily so that that is there's some comfort there. I'm sure but also are, you know, I don't know, you know, when you were when you were practicing law, I don't know if you were out there securing clients and going out and sort of shaking the hands and getting business or if more things were assigned to you, but, but now, you know, now you're on your own, you're in charge of every, wearing every hat for the for the business and also learning how to.
[00:15:33] How to actually be a decent REALTOR, of course, you have become an beyond excellent REALTOR now, but was what was it like in those first six months, you know, how did you secure you had one friend that turned out to be a buyer.
[00:15:46] You know, the other one didn't and then it sounded like, you know, you were you were on your own trying to to drum up business, how did you do that back then if you don't mind sharing.
[00:15:56] You know, it's funny, I think back and I in some ways I still don't totally know I don't remember and I will also say and we get this from agents all over the country.
[00:16:08] Price points in New York are quite high, you know, and the reality was at the time in order to sort of level my real estate salary salary to where.
[00:16:24] My law firm had been I think I figured out pretty quickly that I needed to sell something like eight million dollars and at the time, you know, maybe it ended probably with a little more.
[00:16:37] I hate to say this like that's not that hard to do in New York and so even in two thousand to I guess.
[00:16:46] And so my first sale admittedly was a million dollar sale, which was a big deal, it was a crappy locked in Tribeca.
[00:16:58] And then I had a cup I did what people young brokers do I worked I worked open houses for senior brokers for clients that was probably my second sale was a pretty good sale.
[00:17:15] And so I think I was a little bit more than I thought, but I think that was a big deal also I think over a million dollars from somebody that I met at an at an open house.
[00:17:22] And then I definitely I worked at Corcoran at the time and there was a place on the website that you could go and say this is what I'm looking for and I think that was my third sale and that was probably a 350,000 dollar co op.
[00:17:38] And it sort of I mean, and then there were a couple of associates who I knew at my law firm who referred me to friends and so sometimes it wasn't the lawyers, but it was friends of lawyers.
[00:17:52] And honestly it just it went from there and I was fortunate to have one or two listings early on and that was really where I got buyers.
[00:18:08] And in 2002 people buying a $400,000 apartment often didn't we're not working with brokers.
[00:18:18] And so there were a lot of direct people and then it you know I don't remember entirely, but it just it did start to it starts to snowball and I remember very early on in my career a woman in my office was sort of giving this motivational talk and talked about.
[00:18:39] It was sort of like a family tree or like the anatomy of a transaction and more so of the referral network and she talked about how she sold very inexpensive studio to this actor in New York and then he introduced her to this person and they introduced her to these two people.
[00:19:00] And how from this one like $200,000 studio sale she ended up doing like $15 million in this.
[00:19:08] So it's really it's really acknowledging that and recognizing that there's always an opportunity, but there's also a good way to do that and a and sort of an obnoxious way to do that.
[00:19:22] And so I think it's finding that middle ground and staying in front of people obviously I'm a huge proponent and this is a little more due as I say and not as I do because I don't always get around to it, but newsletters I think are probably the single best source of clients because they're also free.
[00:19:45] You know, mailers are expensive like running and adding New York magazine is really expensive.
[00:19:54] Newsletters are free and you control the content and you control the presentation and you know to this day any time we send out a newsletter we get some response usually some referral.
[00:20:08] Yeah, I used to I did a talk once at a conference that was something I can't remember the exact title, but it was said nobody wants to read your newsletter, but that's not the point.
[00:20:20] And I talked about how whether or not people read the actual content of the newsletter is largely irrelevant, although it's obviously good to have good content and hopefully some of the people that you sent a to might actually read some of the articles, but just this idea from a branding perspective.
[00:20:37] So I think that's a great idea to have a lot of, hey, this is what I do here's here's you know a little bit of acknowledgement that I know what's going on in the market, I put this together I'm sending it out and you know it's always good to stay if not front of mine back of mine from for clients and you're absolutely right that consistency does in fact work I was thinking about this like I am.
[00:20:57] You know, I know you work with a lot of new to what you work with developers, you work with a lot of new developments I actually was just thinking so I purchased in a new development couple year and a half ago and so I've been there a year and a year and a half a little bit more than a year and a half and I have not received any communication from any other REALTORS.
[00:21:19] Usually you start getting postcards and things and I understand that on the statistical side I am people who purchased it on my building probably aren't going to purchase for the next or sell for the next I don't know five years, you know who knows seven years whatever it is.
[00:21:35] So I get it there's a long term play here if you want to start introducing but you know not one there's 45,000 REALTORS in the Chicago land area not one postcard from anyone going hey congrats on you.
[00:21:48] So I'm going to start with a new purchase by the way you know I would love to just learn more about you I'm going to keep you updated on you know what's going on with your place again tons of opportunity right to like build relationships and that's what you do really really well is is build relationships you were talking about this how how you know your friend.
[00:22:07] One transaction you know for one person can lead to 15 million dollars in production over time yeah that is clearly the way that you've done it but I wanted to ask you because you said something I thought was very interesting you said there's an obnoxious way to sort of build those relationships and then there's a way that that is you know more you know gentle and and and non invasive and do you mind sharing a little bit about how you think about you know maybe asking for a referral or maybe you don't ask.
[00:22:36] Maybe you demonstrate value in a different way but how do you do it in a way that's most comfortable for you.
[00:22:43] I want to pause for a moment to talk about our episode sponsor are one of my favorite companies out there follow up boss now after interviewing hundreds of top REALTORS in the country for the spot cast you know which CRM is used by more than any other by our guests of course it is follow up boss and let's face it following up is the key to taking your business to the next level follow up boss will help you draw.

[00:24:06] I definitely am one of those people who is I have a hard time asking for things honestly I know they're probably friends of mine who might say that's not true but I you know I don't like to be pushy and I don't like to be salesy I remember my mom was not happy when I left my job and my dad was like it said to me you know you're really you really don't have a salesman's personality.
[00:24:31] And you know what I said to him is I don't feel like I'm going into sales I'm not chasing people down on the street and saying do you want to buy an apartment I'm I'm fulfilling the need that they already have their they're choosing to at least explore the possibility and I'm working in an advisory capacity and I view myself as being a professional and not a salesperson.
[00:25:00] So I think that goes across the board whether it's how you're trying to sell a property or how you're trying to sell yourself as a broker is by and large I try to be as valuable as possible to my clients so that of course don't refer me.
[00:25:25] I certainly have sort of I guess the typical call to action to kind of things in my newsletter of you know if anybody if you're looking if anybody's considering a real estate purchase if you need any advice call us but beyond that we don't really.
[00:25:43] Every once in a while you know if I am talking to somebody I know really well I will say something explicitly along the lines of hey you know we always really appreciate referrals and of course when I when I get one I try very hard to to call that person right away and I think it's important and you know this is the lesson I've learned from other people but I think it's I I've learned it for myself too.
[00:26:12] A referral is not about the sale it's about the referral and so you can't wait until somebody buys and they might not but you wonderful you want to encourage people to refer you business so even if they refer you a crappy client you can even call and say I really appreciate the referral just so you know like that's not really necessarily the type of business that I do I can find somebody to refer them to but if you're ever talking to somebody.
[00:26:43] Like this is a great referral for me.
[00:26:46] And isn't isn't that what attorneys do as well because attorneys get these calls all the time because people think oh attorneys just can do everything and every specialty and so this this is very much often what happens with attorneys were like oh I don't do that but my buddy does and you know what.
[00:27:01] And nobody says to the attorney who who isn't able to service that client well gosh I don't even know why I called you you can't handle that no the person goes hey you know what I'm a specialist in this but my buddy does this I'm going to send you over to him or her and and so it really shouldn't work any differently with with REALTORS I think you're right there may be this fear of like oh not they're not going to refer me anyone else because I wasn't able to help this person but I think as long as you're providing value like you said and just passing it off to somebody who does do that.
[00:27:30] That's I don't see any negative to that at all.
[00:27:33] Yeah and that's exactly it you want people to recognize you as they're go to for anything real estate and so I think to that end it's also really important to have a great referral network yourself and so if you're always getting referral you know if people are always calling you who say okay well I'm looking at Park Slope but I'm also looking at you.
[00:28:00] I'm looking at Montclair New Jersey it's important to have someone in Montclair New Jersey and so you know if if you're if you don't do rentals you need to have a really good rental broker I say this again do as I say not as I do because I've I've searched for that and it's always a challenge because that markets also changing quickly and so sometimes your best rental brokers end up deciding they also don't want to do rentals but I think it's important to be able to do that.
[00:28:30] You know there's a great referral network you know there's the obvious ones you gotta have a great lawyer got a great great mortgage broker or several of each but you also need great referral brokers in other markets that you might cross over with.
[00:28:49] Yeah and again that's how attorney attorneys are very good at this right that I think attorneys are almost better referrals than any other profession I'm aware of I mean they just see I always ask attorneys like how do you get business and they're like well I get a lot of referrals from these different channels and it is it seems like so much more of a mystery and how to do it as a REALTOR so I imagine with that background you probably just were naturally more understanding of I do this and I've I've been.
[00:29:18] I've been working on this very specific focus because that's where I can provide them the most amount of value and I need to have this other almost team in place for anything that's outside of those those really strict boundaries because I'm just not going to be as effective as you know the person down the street who that's what they do so that makes that makes so much sense we talk about that a lot on the show but I think it can't probably be talked about enough this idea of having this really strong that you know referral network which hopefully also is two way that comes.
[00:29:48] Yeah exactly.
[00:29:49] Yeah I wanted to ask about so you know you being in New York during of course the pandemic and and seeing you know a lot of people sort of leaving the city because of course you know New York had had a lot of publicity around you know COVID and the effects that it had you guys were basically sort of the epicenter of the United States you know part of of COVID at least at the beginning and you saw a lot of uncertainty around the city it seems like that's changed and so it seems like people are are returning more.
[00:30:18] More so to the city and also to you know places like Brooklyn well Brooklyn's always been super cool and awesome and I imagine it hasn't always been but it's certainly over the last 20 30 years it's really changed but was that was that were you concerned at all during that time that oh my business might radically shift based on you know these sort of uncontrollable you know sort of things going on in the world.
[00:30:42] Not for long I definitely had that moment of just absolute panic that made no sense you know I remember very distinctly walking along the reservoir upstate with my kids because we spent much of COVID at our house upstate like many New Yorkers did.
[00:31:09] And I remember a moment of panic of what am I going to do and then really over the course of the next couple weeks I was really focused on trying to get the deals done that were kind of hanging in the balance.
[00:31:24] But it also really highlighted to me that real estate the selling residential real estate is a everyone will always need to buy and sell you know and there I think Barbara Corcoran at some point said you know it's always a broker's market whether it's a buyer's market or sellers market if you're a good broker you should be selling because things are selling.
[00:31:54] That being said I you know I there's been a lot of talk about all of this because the market has changed and I was having a conversation with someone.
[00:32:05] For some sort of pretty well known publication and it will really into interesting conversation and the reality is what you do need for a market is buyers and if you have no buyers you have no market.
[00:32:19] And so that was certainly a difficult you know and the market self correct so if you don't have buyers at some point you're going to drop the price low enough where you're buyers but that was certainly a fear at some point but I I don't know if I'm just a little bit deep down even though I don't seem like it necessarily a little bit of a polyanna that I believe that things are going to work out.
[00:32:49] But I also I've lived in New York for 27 years 25 years excuse me and New York is unlike you know I mean New York is unlike any city as is Chicago as is you know all of these sort of world capitals are unique and they're desirable you know they have so much to offer and I will also say that I had a very selfish moment of going people are really going to want to say.
[00:33:19] But I think that's the only thing that I've ever lived in town houses now and that was absolutely the case so yeah there were certainly concerns there's there are always concerns as things change dramatically like we're going through right now frankly you know uncertainty is difficult in any market.
[00:33:36] But I knew even if people left people would come to take their places and I mean we've already seen people who left during cove come back so it uh you know so so no I was not very worried for very long.
[00:33:55] I knew that there would be a lot of adaptations and there was a lot of talk about selling you know houses via FaceTime and this and that and I didn't have I didn't think that was going to last long either and I think that's largely the case I mean we've served we've done a few deals side unseen not many certainly people who've done like a first tour FaceTime but you know it's a big purchase and it's it's personal and I just I did it.
[00:34:24] I do think that there was going to be much duration of people buying from videos and stuff.
[00:34:31] Yeah and that seems to have kind of gone away at this point although what's nice is for people that are able to do that and willing to do that it's just much more normalized now so even though we're back to being in person hopefully that will not change although who does.
[00:34:50] But at least that that that has been normalized you know throughout the last several years so you do have people that are willing more willing to explore virtual conversations so it's a nice option that isn't bizarre or weird or yeah.
[00:35:06] You know it's just been normalized so I suspect that's that's been good for for agents who do have some clients who maybe are like you know what let's just just show up with the FaceTime and let's let's walk through it virtually.
[00:35:17] I had a question up to two questions because you work with a lot of developers and so one of the it's funny whenever we do episodes of course most of the brokers we we have on the show and I say broker again synonymous here where I'm from with REALTOR so if I say broker not everyone in the country doesn't always know what that means we'll just please excuse my language will that will be REALTOR but anyway a lot of the a lot of the REALTOR we have on the show are top producers almost all of them are and a lot of them work in the luxury market.
[00:35:46] And that's for people who don't work in the luxury market you know that's oftentimes something they feel like they should aspire to is to being a luxury broker but also developers that's the other one that people get really excited about because it's seen as this I've I've arrived if developers are now choosing me to represent their you know their developments and of course yeah there's a certain truth to that how did you start to get involved the developers what was it that allowed you to win.
[00:36:16] And then you can go over their trust in their business.
[00:36:22] Admittedly in part I I started a development company with my ex-execit so my ex-execit has been with an architect and I was you know I was when we we talked about it on our first date it was very pathetic.
[00:36:37] So he was an architect and I was a real estate lawyer and we were both really interested in development and and we started a.
[00:36:49] A real estate development company and did a bunch of condo projects in the area of Brooklyn where we left at the time and that really helped me get my foot in the door and you know I was much more in that world of other developers and.
[00:37:07] So I think people other developers saw that I really understood and often there is a there isn't always an alignment of what the broker wants and what the developer wants in terms of incentive structure I mean as a broker your happy for them to spend.
[00:37:33] You know no limit of money on advertising because it's going to help bring people in and of course yeah you're going to be able to sell things for higher prices if you have more more demand for the product and all of those things but it's not necessarily one to one and but if you're.
[00:37:52] Also invested in just the ultimate success of the project and the absolute success of the project you're going to have a different perspective and so I think that that certainly was important you know and yeah.
[00:38:09] Yeah I just wanted to jump in for a second and say like what you just said is actually quite profound because developers want people who understand what the pain points of a developer are which of course yes getting getting the property sold yes obviously that's why they're hiring you but for the agent to say.
[00:38:29] Or at least have the mindset of I don't want i'm not going to keep coming to you mr developer for more add dollars or I don't want to keep investing myself as the agent into you know more than I think is reasonable but understanding that that it is a business and running it like a business and it goes beyond just you selling the property having an understanding of what developers deal with since you've done that.
[00:38:50] It was obviously part of your your family history as well I think gives you a tremendous advantage when meeting with developers you're like I grew up with this number one yeah I know it i've been on on all sides of it and I've also run my own development company which which again it's it's funny I I hope that our audience is really inspired by that because anyone listening can to can build their own development company as well and and if you don't if you're if your husband.
[00:39:19] Isn't an architect which of course most most of our listeners don't have that in their immediate family go out and find an architect there are millions of them who absolutely are probably waiting for somebody to partner up with so it is it is something that again is a really smart way to sort of get involved with developers because then you get to say when you're pitching to other developers oh I do this also by the way maybe on a smaller scale or maybe on a different you know sector but this is what I know what you what you deal with it.
[00:39:48] I want to help you and I imagine that's a very powerful pitch.
[00:39:53] Yeah I certainly think it is but I also do you know I think that one thing I also believe strongly about being an agent or being a broker or a REALTOR it's a job and so I think it's it's important not to sort of look at it as something where you're also going to be doing this also going to be doing this like I think coming to do this.
[00:40:18] I think one of the best ways to sort of digest that is to make sure that you do understand that person's business just like a you know when you have a residential client who's looking for a new home knowing that they have family overseas who comes to stay all the time and they need a separate place for that person.
[00:40:48] To stay that feels a little separate and they've got space and they've got their own little kitchen like that if you don't know that you're going to show people the wrong thing and so I think understanding what how it works as a developer and the profit structure and knowing that if you only suggest the most expensive stage are they may feel like you don't have their interests at heart and you don't even understand.
[00:41:18] And what their business is and so I think it's really important to communicate that you will protect them by only coming to them with things that you have evaluated yourself and say oh hey the you know the juices worth the squeeze or whatever like we're going to spend $20,000 on this campaign.
[00:41:48] But I think ultimately it's going to translate into a 2% increase in sale prices, which is $200,000. So you know I think it's acknowledging that that's their money and you're not just going to spend their money because it's going to produce better material or sort you know so I think that's probably the most important part is just this understanding your client.
[00:42:15] Yeah, I agree. Yes, and again that's probably also the skills you developed as an attorney. It's probably incredibly helpful for how important it is to get a good sense of what the client wants and needs so that you know you can continue working for them in a way that that is most effective for them.
[00:42:33] Question about sort of today's market so we know of course everyone listening to the show knows rates have changed, doubled in a lot of cases, maybe even more than doubled at this point.
[00:42:45] Yeah, seems to change almost daily and I don't know what it's at today, but but it certainly has gone up. So rates are double what they were at the lowest point, which I don't think is maybe the best metric to measure against, but it's what people know because it was so prominent.
[00:43:03] So it's definitely featured in news and social media, how rates were so low and now people maybe feel oh I missed out except of course what they maybe don't always know is there were lots and lots of buyers and places prices were inflated and maybe it's not so different now even though rates have changed, but but they're just maybe a lot more sentiment out there that now's not the time to to make any big moves.
[00:43:28] So understanding that those are some hurdles that REALTORS are dealing with all over the country.
[00:43:33] How have you been dealing with that? How have you been educating your clients and just keeping your business going despite the fact that there probably are fewer buyers in the market at this point.
[00:43:43] I think that's absolutely true. They're definitely are fewer buyers and fewer real buyers because even if people I mean it's it's really hard even if people feel like real buyers if you were looking a month ago and then you went on vacation or something and came back and then you find something and then you get your pre approval updated.
[00:44:09] You know I think we're seeing that a lot we're seeing more deals fall apart and I think that's probably part of it is that people are not internalizing or properly sort of analyzing what these rate changes mean.
[00:44:24] But I will say I think it's really important to recognize that rates are fluid and they go up with they are very likely to come down again and so if you know I have this conversation with a few clients recently at many of whom said you know that's true.
[00:44:52] I really hadn't thought about it that way and of course when rates are super low you're really excited because you can lock in this rate for a long time and you know what your monthly outlay is going to be.
[00:45:05] But when rates are high it's important to remember it doesn't have to stay like that forever.
[00:45:11] And so you know real estate is a long term play almost no matter what and when you're buying a home maybe life does change and you end up selling it in three years.
[00:45:26] But you know I for most of my clients any clients who are not investors you know my recommendation to them is you can't really have any expectation of appreciation unless you plan to stay in this home for at least probably five years you never know and you need that flexibility on that because if the market's in the toilet five years you want to be able to hang on to it for another two or or you know move up.
[00:45:53] But it's a long term play and because rates we have seen have changed so quickly so dramatically we don't know what's going to happen and i'm not going to promise anybody that rates are going to go back down to you know three percent for 30 or fixed but I can tell people with some degree of confidence that I certainly think they'll go down again in a meaningful way over the course of the next two to three years.
[00:46:23] So I think it is an opportunity I think that that will take some time because sellers are having a hard time adjusting.
[00:46:34] 
[00:46:34] So that's what I can't get twice the listing price.
[00:46:38] You know anymore or I can't get exactly the same price that they got down the street.
[00:46:43] Right and and then you know we work in we work in different markets we work across a lot of price points and for New York and you know I certainly recognize that and it's one thing we are seeing is the very high in Brooklyn in particular turnkey townhouse market it's stable.
[00:47:08] There aren't really many rental alternatives if you want a really nice townhouse in Brooklyn Heights there's not one to rent so you may still end up in the sale market.
[00:47:21] You know there's a lot of liquidity at that price point and so we are really having a hard time getting a meeting in the mines at that price point but things are staying pretty stable.
[00:47:34] You know lower price points people are a little bit more understanding that interest rates have really made a big hit and so you know I think I'm sure everyone's going through the same thing it's educating your sellers educating your buyers keeping buyers spirits elevated that what they're doing is good for the good for their themselves in their family long term.
[00:47:58] I think it seems like so many people and it's so because it oftentimes is buyers or you know largest asset or one of their largest assets it becomes this idea that it this primary residence is an investment and I think the REALTOR's could I'm curious to get your thoughts on this could really do their clients of favor by readjusting that expectation that number one.
[00:48:25] Yes okay maybe technically it's an investment but it's you have to live somewhere right so even if it does go up by you know two times what you paid for it odds are you're not downsizing on your next home that's not usually the sort of human nature psychology piece of it is it's like well I'm just going to bank this extra 500 grand I just made usually it's like now we can upgrade to a higher price point property maybe once somebody hits retirement age that changes and they down.
[00:48:55] Size and then yeah they can bank some of that money that's not usually what most people do with their profit from their primary residence at least that's not been my experience with anybody I know maybe maybe the most savvy people would do that but most of us you know we don't buy a 20 inch TV when we're you know a teenager and that's all we can afford and then when we're 40 we go you know let's go back to a 20 inch TV right it goes no I want the 65 inch or the 80 inch or whatever we keep going bigger and bigger until we realize maybe things are too big but but the point
[00:49:25] is is it's my sister did this she her place almost doubled in value in the West Village she was on Barrow which is like beyond amazing street you I'm sure you know it and then you know fifth floor walk up no air condition you know a little tiny
[00:49:38] union no amenities really I was a co-op and fifth floor walk up and it was like 475 square feet one bedroom that includes a one
[00:49:50] bedroom as just a little tiny nothing place but it was it was lovely but it was just tiny and everything was miniature and stuff and and then she she she took that money and then you know she goes well now I can't live in my neighborhood anymore because even though her she had made all this money she had actually priced herself out of her actual street and so she ended up moving to Queens with it with her fiance at the time and it ended up working out for them but but again people don't usually go from a 475 square foot you know co-op to
[00:50:20] well you know maybe I'll just stay at 475 square feet right she so this idea that people see their primary home as an investment I think can can be very problematic and and it's it's I think it's just not an investment maybe unless it is unless it is something that generates income or that you know you're going to move to an investment property at some point but but this idea that
[00:50:42] REALTOR can can really reeducate their clients about this this let's not think of this as an investment as much as a lifestyle and and quality of life sort of situation I think that would I think that would
[00:50:54] well and also dating the rate on the lending side marrying the home you know that's that expression that that it's it's sort of a cutesy expression that people say but it's a good expression because I think it's exactly right I mean rates do change people refinance and you know we're not in the double digits right it's not
[00:51:11] the early early eight late 70s early 80s anymore which that was a really difficult times I can't even imagine what it's like to try to be a buyer's agent when it's you know 12% rates but people were doing it then too so yeah anyway I've gone on enough of a rant about that but I really appreciate your thoughts about it because I think you know for anyone out there who's going gosh the buyers just aren't into it they feel like they're getting ripped off at this point time to reeducate yourself as the agent about how to have that conversation
[00:51:41] to say you know what even if you would have tried to buy a place two years ago you would have here's what you probably would have paid over asking for what you're looking for I'm going to show you evidence that would have suggested that you know maybe it wasn't such a great time for you or maybe it can still be a good time today and we can refinance in a couple of years if if need yeah so anyway I'm sorry I will get off of it so boxy brand there but I want I want agents to not be so so disheartening
[00:52:11] during this time and you have a billion dollar business that you've built and that is beyond impressive I want to ask sort of my last question which is so you talked about newsletters we talked about client relationships and how one can lead to one plus one you know can lead to to dozens and dozens and dozens
[00:52:30] what advice do you have for agents who want to further develop those those relationships make those more intimate make those more important really
[00:52:41] demonstrate value so that in between sales maybe those people again you mentioned newsletters keep your name in front but what else are you doing just so that the your clients don't forget about you or that they keep thinking about you when they're talking to other other people who might need your services.
[00:52:58] I am not as good at that as I should be quite honestly and in many ways because I've been fortunate in in building these relationships that largely feed themselves I mean and then New York Market it is a unique thing I know that it has remained strong in times when others have not been I think this COVID experience was really unique and I'm not sure what that is like that is the same thing I did before.
[00:53:26] In that it was one of the few times that we've seen you know somebody selling in New York and buying somewhere else and they don't come out ahead and not necessarily in actual like dollars in your pocket but in terms of the strength of the market that you know that you're getting top dollar in New York and you know that you're buying at a little bit of a discount wherever you may be going and that really got hooked on the
[00:53:53] head and that was a big adjustment but it was also a really interesting illustration of what drives people and people were buying because they wanted to move and so they were able to just say look this is what's right for me this is what I want and I'm going to do it and this is the price this is the price that it is today and so I think that it's important for people to remember that that the one and this touches on the
[00:54:23] what you were saying it's you're doing this for yourself and for your future self and for your family and you know you got to make the choice that's right for you that is somewhat untethered from is this the right investment and so
[00:54:42] and I'm going to I'm going to go back one second a little bit about that because I totally understand and agree with you that it is not exclusively an investment but I think another way to look at that and I've spoken
[00:54:55] of clients a number of times is it is a lifetime investment and very rarely are people selling and then renting unless it's sort of a temporary either move
[00:55:10] for one reason or another or renovation or relocation or whatever maybe you know a strategic decision but people are done really staying in the market so you know I we get so many people who say I can't lose money on this house well if you're selling at a discount whatever you're buying in all likelihood is also with that same discount it's a lifetime and so in your you know lifetime portfolio of real estate
[00:55:39] holdings you're probably going to come out ahead of the stock market historically that is what has happened and so I think don't like don't get so fixated on everyone transaction because that's not what it is it's a it's a lifetime of owning your home
[00:55:58] and there are ways to leverage that if you have a rental unit you can do a 1031 exchange and you feel like genius you know there's a lot of different ways to leverage real estate ownership and so I think that's important to to focus on also and frankly like you still do get that primary
[00:56:19] residence interstituction so I think that something we should really be focusing on right now too because if you're paying more you're getting a much larger deduction so that's something that's my that's my sort of call back to the last one.
[00:56:34] No I appreciate that and I I want to just wrap up because you have been this has been so valuable to our audience I always like you know when I first started this this show all these years ago it was like oh all of these top producers are going to have all of these very specific strategies and tips that the rest of us don't know about what I've learned after 400 episodes is that is rarely the case that there's like this little secret magic formula that you know we're going to unearth on this show and
[00:57:03] and and it hasn't happened yet but but maybe maybe in the next 400 episodes somebody will have that but the reality of it is it isn't much about that at all and it's more about consistency and discipline and also just understanding how people think who are really at the top of the mountain as a REALTOR
[00:57:23] And so I think you've given us today,
[00:57:26] you've given us some great strategies.
[00:57:27] But on top of that, just this idea of like,
[00:57:29] here's how I think about things,
[00:57:31] here's how I keep going.
[00:57:33] Because at the end of the day,
[00:57:35] sort of I think mindset,
[00:57:36] and again that word is I think really overused
[00:57:38] and it sort of doesn't even mean a whole lot anymore.
[00:57:42] But this idea of just the beliefs and the strategies
[00:57:44] that somebody has that, you know,
[00:57:46] like you were saying, Barbara Corcoran saying,
[00:57:48] there's always buyers and sellers.
[00:57:50] There's always a broker's market.
[00:57:53] It's about making sure that you can pivot
[00:57:56] and adjust to those changes.
[00:57:58] And I also want to mention that Lindsay is currently looking
[00:58:02] for one additional team member.
[00:58:05] Now this is a billion dollar team.
[00:58:07] So she doesn't of course take any and all agents
[00:58:10] that reach out to her.
[00:58:12] And in fact, you'd have to probably be somebody
[00:58:13] that is really impressive.
[00:58:15] And she did not say that to me.
[00:58:17] I'm saying it on her behalf.
[00:58:19] Because I know that she's going to expect somebody
[00:58:21] who is really somebody dynamic and special.
[00:58:24] But if you are a REALTOR in the New York market,
[00:58:28] specifically Brooklyn, Manhattan,
[00:58:30] anywhere there that you think you could be a value
[00:58:33] and you could be a valued member of her team,
[00:58:36] reach out to her.
[00:58:37] The best way to do that,
[00:58:38] just go to her website.
[00:58:39] You can submit some information.
[00:58:41] And also by the way, for everyone else
[00:58:42] who's listening who's a REALTOR,
[00:58:44] whether you're in New York or elsewhere in the country,
[00:58:46] if you have clients that are moving to the city,
[00:58:50] moving to Brooklyn, moving to other places
[00:58:52] in the New York metro area.
[00:58:54] And you're looking for a top producer to send them to.
[00:58:58] Well, obviously, Lindsay is a great choice.
[00:59:00] She's at an amazing firm.
[00:59:02] We've interviewed tons of people from Douglas
[00:59:04] Alman over the years.
[00:59:05] And they're always just really best
[00:59:07] of the best.
[00:59:08] Obviously, Douglas Alman's doing something
[00:59:10] right in their hiring.
[00:59:11] But also, if you are looking for a broker to refer to,
[00:59:15] Lindsay would love the opportunity to connect with you.
[00:59:17] Lindsay, what is the best way another agent
[00:59:19] can reach out to you?
[00:59:22] Website, definitely.
[00:59:24] And we have a team email,
[00:59:27] which we did by necessity.
[00:59:29] I, you know, over the years,
[00:59:31] sort of figured out some of the things.
[00:59:33] And everyone responding to the same email at once.
[00:59:39] And sometimes responding from my email.
[00:59:42] And then I also respond,
[00:59:44] gave rise to the LBB team email.
[00:59:47] So LBB team at Alman.com is probably the best way.
[00:59:51] And we'll post a link to that in the show notes as well.
[00:59:54] So if you are an agent that wants to partner with Lindsay
[00:59:57] with referrals or maybe you're looking to
[01:00:00] explore being on a team yourself and you live in that area,
[01:00:04] reach out to Lindsay to see if you might be a good fit for her.
[01:00:07] And by the way, she's not always hiring,
[01:00:09] like most real estate firms like our firm were always hiring.
[01:00:12] So you can always reach out to me
[01:00:14] if you want to join our company in Chicago.
[01:00:15] But Lindsay is not that, that kind of agent
[01:00:18] and doesn't have that kind of team.
[01:00:20] It's a very exclusive small team
[01:00:22] that she can really manage, you know,
[01:00:24] work with and make sure that, you know,
[01:00:26] all of her team members are having success.
[01:00:27] So definitely reach out to her if you think
[01:00:29] that would be a good fit.
[01:00:31] Lindsay, thank you so much for being on the show.
[01:00:33] We had, I had such fun time with you.
[01:00:35] You really, really appreciate how busy you are.
[01:00:39] And really just, again, walking away from a really,
[01:00:42] really sort of something that you would work so hard for
[01:00:46] and not walked away entirely,
[01:00:48] but walked away from that being your profession
[01:00:50] and your source of income is truly, you know,
[01:00:54] it's really, again, this courageous quality that you have,
[01:00:59] I think is amazing.
[01:01:00] And so I hope it's inspiring to our audience.
[01:01:03] And also we want to thank Lindsay for her time.
[01:01:06] We know how busy she is.
[01:01:08] And so on behalf of the audience,

We are very happy to Lindsay and I were just talking about some some other things prior to the show, not real estate related. So I am really excited to learn more about your your path and progress and journey through real estate. But I'd love to start all the way to beginning because I know in your previous career, you are a real estate attorney as well. But how did you get involved in real estate to begin with? I would say probably goes back a little before that I grew up in Seattle and my my dad was a more lots of hats over the years, but was involved in real estate development and construction a little bit at certain points and in the hotel business as well. And that just it always interested me because it covers so much ground. It's really personal yet also tangible. And so I was I was intrigued by it from an early age, honestly, the construction part of it, all of that. And then I went to law school and I went to Columbia, which is a very traditional law school approach, you know, think paper chase. You know, we don't teach you to be a lawyer. We teach you to think like a lawyer. And so it was very theoretical in certain ways. And there was not a lot of specific sort of there was not a there were not a lot of specific classes that related to practice areas necessarily offered, including real estate. And maybe there was and maybe I missed it, but I didn't come out knowing that that was what I wanted to do, but I knew that I was interested in real estate. And so I worked as a corporate attorney briefly and when I would do diligence on transactions, you know, M&A transactions or something, I still continue to gravitate to the real estate piece of it. So I ended up lateralling between two big firms in Manhattan and moved to another firm where I was in a real estate dedicated practice. And I really, I was I loved it. I loved the pieces of the transactions, but I didn't love the role that I was playing in transactions. I, I think there are amazing lawyers, but often a lawyer's job is to pinpoint all the potential pitfalls in a transaction instead of focusing on keeping the job. And I was thinking about putting parties together and keeping parties moving forward. And I would work on big transactions where there were both commercial real estate brokers and investment bankers on the deals and just sitting on conference calls or sitting in the room. I would look at what they were doing and think that's what I want to be doing. I want to be building things and putting deals together and helping really smart people who know what they want to do get together and do it in in a profitable and, you know, they know what they're doing, you know, our clients really knew what they were doing. And so I often felt that the lawyers were just bringing up the same points every single time that had been resolved in the last iteration of this document. And I just didn't, I didn't like the role that I was playing and it may have been a function of being in a big firm versus being at a smaller firm. But ultimately I just felt like between not seeing myself as a New York lawyer and the various sort of the various limitations that that can present in terms of hours worked and all of those things. I just became clear to me that I wanted something different in my role and in my in my hours and all of that. And so I and then I bought an apartment with a tiny bit of money. I put 5% down, I think, on a condo in the East Village. Which by the way, which by the way, 5% down on a condo in the East Village is still a tremendous down payment. It was a long time ago, but yes, yes, it was. And so I, you know, I put 5% down, I bought a condo in the East Village and then over the years, you know, and that was one thing that I really that has also been a driver for me of what I do is that I do have a very sort of quintessent. I'm not sure if you're going to be able to see the actual real estate escalation story of I bought the condo in the East Village turned around and bought a co up in Cobble Hill turned around and bought a relatively, you know, for the time and for New York inexpensive townhouse that ultimately we got renovated. And I sold it this past year for a significant multiple of a the condo in the East Village in 2000, but also what we bought it for. So it really and it enabled me to do this job. I was able to take out a home equity line of credit. So I had something to fall back on and so real estate has actually really kind of done for me what I think it does for a lot of people. But what I think a lot of people don't really believe happens anymore. So that's sort of my backstory. Yeah, and there was really a lot there. I just want to unpack a couple of things. Number one, I want to honor you for the courage to walk away from a legal career that you worked. Well, number one, Columbia is not one of the worst law schools in the country. It's actually one of the very top and that I'm sure that's how you of course how you got to New York. Did you also do your undergraduate New York as well or did you just end up there for law school? I was in upstate New York. I went to Cornell undergrad. So I went to I went to great schools, you know, no complaints here, you know, but it just it it. It was a different path, but it brought me to where I am now. It's was it difficult to walk away from working so hard to pass the bar and of course work in incorporate, you know, the corporate law world and then to be an MNA activity, mergers and acquisitions and then say, you know, I really this isn't my I don't want to bill, you know, a thousand hours a year anymore or whatever the whatever lawyers are building these days. I know it's always a staggering staggering number and sort of trading hours for dollars is really what attorneys do, which is why they work so much. Was that any more especially. It was hardest for my mom, I would say sure. My mom was not happy about the decision. What are you doing with your life? Yes, yes. And I should be really nice to my mom right now. She's not too great, but I she was not happy that I quit my job. It was scary. It was definitely scary. And you know, it's true, you need a real sort of you need something to fall back on and I genuinely got that exclusively by doing a home equity line of credit before I put my job taking that money and knowing that I had it. And then leaving and so it was definitely scary. I felt like I had maybe one client, maybe two, they were sort of friends that graciously trusted me with their home purchase or home search. I think one of them ended up buying and one of them didn't and then otherwise I really, you know, I think people look at me and go, oh, you had all these like lawyers lawyers are very conservative. I have a lot of law school friends who still rent in New York City and I graduated from law school 23 years ago. So, you know, lawyers turned out not to necessarily be my sort of go to client base either. And when I when I left, I knew I didn't really know what I was doing entirely. So it was very nervous to try to tap that resource and mess it up. And so I didn't sort of dive back into the law firm world to try to get clients because when you first become an agent, your job is getting clients not doing your job. So, yeah, so I was nervous. Obviously I had a paycheck and at that point I had a mortgage and but I was excited about it. And I felt like I had the cushion and I could give it time and if after six months, it didn't work out. So I will move on, but fortunately it did. It did. I landed in a good place. I had a great support system in terms of my manager and people that I worked with. And I, you know, I at the time I was engaged and then ultimately my husband was supportive and now he's not my husband anymore. And so yeah, I was able to do it. It was scary, but I was really fortunate in kind of I mean, I don't know why managed to hit the ground running and then just build from there and get referrals from the people that I, I worked with. How did so since you didn't tap the hey, my friends at the law firm I was at or certainly people who know me in my field. As you were saying, because I was thinking, oh, this is so brilliant because she's all of her clients will be the attorney she knows. And that turns out, but you you served my question by saying that is not what happened. So I'm actually really interested in and yes, I understand, you know, having this previous career that you'd work so hard for. Obviously, you can fall back could have fall back fell back onto that very I'm sure very easily so that that is there's some comfort there. I'm sure but also are, you know, I don't know, you know, when you were when you were practicing law, I don't know if you were out there securing clients and going out and sort of shaking the hands and getting business or if more things were assigned to you, but, but now, you know, now you're on your own, you're in charge of every, wearing every hat for the for the business and also learning how to. How to actually be a decent REALTOR, of course, you have become an beyond excellent REALTOR now, but was what was it like in those first six months, you know, how did you secure you had one friend that turned out to be a buyer. You know, the other one didn't and then it sounded like, you know, you were you were on your own trying to to drum up business, how did you do that back then if you don't mind sharing. You know, it's funny, I think back and I in some ways I still don't totally know I don't remember and I will also say and we get this from agents all over the country. Price points in New York are quite high, you know, and the reality was at the time in order to sort of level my real estate salary salary to where. My law firm had been I think I figured out pretty quickly that I needed to sell something like eight million dollars and at the time, you know, maybe it ended probably with a little more. I hate to say this like that's not that hard to do in New York and so even in two thousand to I guess. And so my first sale admittedly was a million dollar sale, which was a big deal, it was a crappy locked in Tribeca. And then I had a cup I did what people young brokers do I worked I worked open houses for senior brokers for clients that was probably my second sale was a pretty good sale. And so I think I was a little bit more than I thought, but I think that was a big deal also I think over a million dollars from somebody that I met at an at an open house. And then I definitely I worked at Corcoran at the time and there was a place on the website that you could go and say this is what I'm looking for and I think that was my third sale and that was probably a 350,000 dollar co op. And it sort of I mean, and then there were a couple of associates who I knew at my law firm who referred me to friends and so sometimes it wasn't the lawyers, but it was friends of lawyers. And honestly it just it went from there and I was fortunate to have one or two listings early on and that was really where I got buyers. And in 2002 people buying a $400,000 apartment often didn't we're not working with brokers. And so there were a lot of direct people and then it you know I don't remember entirely, but it just it did start to it starts to snowball and I remember very early on in my career a woman in my office was sort of giving this motivational talk and talked about. It was sort of like a family tree or like the anatomy of a transaction and more so of the referral network and she talked about how she sold very inexpensive studio to this actor in New York and then he introduced her to this person and they introduced her to these two people. And how from this one like $200,000 studio sale she ended up doing like $15 million in this. So it's really it's really acknowledging that and recognizing that there's always an opportunity, but there's also a good way to do that and a and sort of an obnoxious way to do that. And so I think it's finding that middle ground and staying in front of people obviously I'm a huge proponent and this is a little more due as I say and not as I do because I don't always get around to it, but newsletters I think are probably the single best source of clients because they're also free. You know, mailers are expensive like running and adding New York magazine is really expensive. Newsletters are free and you control the content and you control the presentation and you know to this day any time we send out a newsletter we get some response usually some referral. Yeah, I used to I did a talk once at a conference that was something I can't remember the exact title, but it was said nobody wants to read your newsletter, but that's not the point. And I talked about how whether or not people read the actual content of the newsletter is largely irrelevant, although it's obviously good to have good content and hopefully some of the people that you sent a to might actually read some of the articles, but just this idea from a branding perspective. So I think that's a great idea to have a lot of, hey, this is what I do here's here's you know a little bit of acknowledgement that I know what's going on in the market, I put this together I'm sending it out and you know it's always good to stay if not front of mine back of mine from for clients and you're absolutely right that consistency does in fact work I was thinking about this like I am. You know, I know you work with a lot of new to what you work with developers, you work with a lot of new developments I actually was just thinking so I purchased in a new development couple year and a half ago and so I've been there a year and a year and a half a little bit more than a year and a half and I have not received any communication from any other REALTORS. Usually you start getting postcards and things and I understand that on the statistical side I am people who purchased it on my building probably aren't going to purchase for the next or sell for the next I don't know five years, you know who knows seven years whatever it is. So I get it there's a long term play here if you want to start introducing but you know not one there's 45,000 REALTORS in the Chicago land area not one postcard from anyone going hey congrats on you. So I'm going to start with a new purchase by the way you know I would love to just learn more about you I'm going to keep you updated on you know what's going on with your place again tons of opportunity right to like build relationships and that's what you do really really well is is build relationships you were talking about this how how you know your friend. One transaction you know for one person can lead to 15 million dollars in production over time yeah that is clearly the way that you've done it but I wanted to ask you because you said something I thought was very interesting you said there's an obnoxious way to sort of build those relationships and then there's a way that that is you know more you know gentle and and and non invasive and do you mind sharing a little bit about how you think about you know maybe asking for a referral or maybe you don't ask. Maybe you demonstrate value in a different way but how do you do it in a way that's most comfortable for you. I want to pause for a moment to talk about our episode sponsor are one of my favorite companies out there follow up boss now after interviewing hundreds of top REALTORS in the country for the spot cast you know which CRM is used by more than any other by our guests of course it is follow up boss and let's face it following up is the key to taking your business to the next level follow up boss will help you draw.

I definitely am one of those people who is I have a hard time asking for things honestly I know they're probably friends of mine who might say that's not true but I you know I don't like to be pushy and I don't like to be salesy I remember my mom was not happy when I left my job and my dad was like it said to me you know you're really you really don't have a salesman's personality. And you know what I said to him is I don't feel like I'm going into sales I'm not chasing people down on the street and saying do you want to buy an apartment I'm I'm fulfilling the need that they already have their they're choosing to at least explore the possibility and I'm working in an advisory capacity and I view myself as being a professional and not a salesperson. So I think that goes across the board whether it's how you're trying to sell a property or how you're trying to sell yourself as a broker is by and large I try to be as valuable as possible to my clients so that of course don't refer me. I certainly have sort of I guess the typical call to action to kind of things in my newsletter of you know if anybody if you're looking if anybody's considering a real estate purchase if you need any advice call us but beyond that we don't really. Every once in a while you know if I am talking to somebody I know really well I will say something explicitly along the lines of hey you know we always really appreciate referrals and of course when I when I get one I try very hard to to call that person right away and I think it's important and you know this is the lesson I've learned from other people but I think it's I I've learned it for myself too. A referral is not about the sale it's about the referral and so you can't wait until somebody buys and they might not but you wonderful you want to encourage people to refer you business so even if they refer you a crappy client you can even call and say I really appreciate the referral just so you know like that's not really necessarily the type of business that I do I can find somebody to refer them to but if you're ever talking to somebody. Like this is a great referral for me. And isn't isn't that what attorneys do as well because attorneys get these calls all the time because people think oh attorneys just can do everything and every specialty and so this this is very much often what happens with attorneys were like oh I don't do that but my buddy does and you know what. And nobody says to the attorney who who isn't able to service that client well gosh I don't even know why I called you you can't handle that no the person goes hey you know what I'm a specialist in this but my buddy does this I'm going to send you over to him or her and and so it really shouldn't work any differently with with REALTORS I think you're right there may be this fear of like oh not they're not going to refer me anyone else because I wasn't able to help this person but I think as long as you're providing value like you said and just passing it off to somebody who does do that. That's I don't see any negative to that at all. Yeah and that's exactly it you want people to recognize you as they're go to for anything real estate and so I think to that end it's also really important to have a great referral network yourself and so if you're always getting referral you know if people are always calling you who say okay well I'm looking at Park Slope but I'm also looking at you. I'm looking at Montclair New Jersey it's important to have someone in Montclair New Jersey and so you know if if you're if you don't do rentals you need to have a really good rental broker I say this again do as I say not as I do because I've I've searched for that and it's always a challenge because that markets also changing quickly and so sometimes your best rental brokers end up deciding they also don't want to do rentals but I think it's important to be able to do that. You know there's a great referral network you know there's the obvious ones you gotta have a great lawyer got a great great mortgage broker or several of each but you also need great referral brokers in other markets that you might cross over with. Yeah and again that's how attorney attorneys are very good at this right that I think attorneys are almost better referrals than any other profession I'm aware of I mean they just see I always ask attorneys like how do you get business and they're like well I get a lot of referrals from these different channels and it is it seems like so much more of a mystery and how to do it as a REALTOR so I imagine with that background you probably just were naturally more understanding of I do this and I've I've been. I've been working on this very specific focus because that's where I can provide them the most amount of value and I need to have this other almost team in place for anything that's outside of those those really strict boundaries because I'm just not going to be as effective as you know the person down the street who that's what they do so that makes that makes so much sense we talk about that a lot on the show but I think it can't probably be talked about enough this idea of having this really strong that you know referral network which hopefully also is two way that comes. Yeah exactly. Yeah I wanted to ask about so you know you being in New York during of course the pandemic and and seeing you know a lot of people sort of leaving the city because of course you know New York had had a lot of publicity around you know COVID and the effects that it had you guys were basically sort of the epicenter of the United States you know part of of COVID at least at the beginning and you saw a lot of uncertainty around the city it seems like that's changed and so it seems like people are are returning more. More so to the city and also to you know places like Brooklyn well Brooklyn's always been super cool and awesome and I imagine it hasn't always been but it's certainly over the last 20 30 years it's really changed but was that was that were you concerned at all during that time that oh my business might radically shift based on you know these sort of uncontrollable you know sort of things going on in the world. Not for long I definitely had that moment of just absolute panic that made no sense you know I remember very distinctly walking along the reservoir upstate with my kids because we spent much of COVID at our house upstate like many New Yorkers did. And I remember a moment of panic of what am I going to do and then really over the course of the next couple weeks I was really focused on trying to get the deals done that were kind of hanging in the balance. But it also really highlighted to me that real estate the selling residential real estate is a everyone will always need to buy and sell you know and there I think Barbara Corcoran at some point said you know it's always a broker's market whether it's a buyer's market or sellers market if you're a good broker you should be selling because things are selling. That being said I you know I there's been a lot of talk about all of this because the market has changed and I was having a conversation with someone. For some sort of pretty well known publication and it will really into interesting conversation and the reality is what you do need for a market is buyers and if you have no buyers you have no market. And so that was certainly a difficult you know and the market self correct so if you don't have buyers at some point you're going to drop the price low enough where you're buyers but that was certainly a fear at some point but I I don't know if I'm just a little bit deep down even though I don't seem like it necessarily a little bit of a polyanna that I believe that things are going to work out. But I also I've lived in New York for 27 years 25 years excuse me and New York is unlike you know I mean New York is unlike any city as is Chicago as is you know all of these sort of world capitals are unique and they're desirable you know they have so much to offer and I will also say that I had a very selfish moment of going people are really going to want to say. But I think that's the only thing that I've ever lived in town houses now and that was absolutely the case so yeah there were certainly concerns there's there are always concerns as things change dramatically like we're going through right now frankly you know uncertainty is difficult in any market. But I knew even if people left people would come to take their places and I mean we've already seen people who left during cove come back so it uh you know so so no I was not very worried for very long. I knew that there would be a lot of adaptations and there was a lot of talk about selling you know houses via FaceTime and this and that and I didn't have I didn't think that was going to last long either and I think that's largely the case I mean we've served we've done a few deals side unseen not many certainly people who've done like a first tour FaceTime but you know it's a big purchase and it's it's personal and I just I did it. I do think that there was going to be much duration of people buying from videos and stuff. Yeah and that seems to have kind of gone away at this point although what's nice is for people that are able to do that and willing to do that it's just much more normalized now so even though we're back to being in person hopefully that will not change although who does. But at least that that that has been normalized you know throughout the last several years so you do have people that are willing more willing to explore virtual conversations so it's a nice option that isn't bizarre or weird or yeah. You know it's just been normalized so I suspect that's that's been good for for agents who do have some clients who maybe are like you know what let's just just show up with the FaceTime and let's let's walk through it virtually. I had a question up to two questions because you work with a lot of developers and so one of the it's funny whenever we do episodes of course most of the brokers we we have on the show and I say broker again synonymous here where I'm from with REALTOR so if I say broker not everyone in the country doesn't always know what that means we'll just please excuse my language will that will be REALTOR but anyway a lot of the a lot of the REALTOR we have on the show are top producers almost all of them are and a lot of them work in the luxury market. And that's for people who don't work in the luxury market you know that's oftentimes something they feel like they should aspire to is to being a luxury broker but also developers that's the other one that people get really excited about because it's seen as this I've I've arrived if developers are now choosing me to represent their you know their developments and of course yeah there's a certain truth to that how did you start to get involved the developers what was it that allowed you to win. And then you can go over their trust in their business. Admittedly in part I I started a development company with my ex-execit so my ex-execit has been with an architect and I was you know I was when we we talked about it on our first date it was very pathetic. So he was an architect and I was a real estate lawyer and we were both really interested in development and and we started a. A real estate development company and did a bunch of condo projects in the area of Brooklyn where we left at the time and that really helped me get my foot in the door and you know I was much more in that world of other developers and. So I think people other developers saw that I really understood and often there is a there isn't always an alignment of what the broker wants and what the developer wants in terms of incentive structure I mean as a broker your happy for them to spend. You know no limit of money on advertising because it's going to help bring people in and of course yeah you're going to be able to sell things for higher prices if you have more more demand for the product and all of those things but it's not necessarily one to one and but if you're. Also invested in just the ultimate success of the project and the absolute success of the project you're going to have a different perspective and so I think that that certainly was important you know and yeah. Yeah I just wanted to jump in for a second and say like what you just said is actually quite profound because developers want people who understand what the pain points of a developer are which of course yes getting getting the property sold yes obviously that's why they're hiring you but for the agent to say. Or at least have the mindset of I don't want i'm not going to keep coming to you mr developer for more add dollars or I don't want to keep investing myself as the agent into you know more than I think is reasonable but understanding that that it is a business and running it like a business and it goes beyond just you selling the property having an understanding of what developers deal with since you've done that. It was obviously part of your your family history as well I think gives you a tremendous advantage when meeting with developers you're like I grew up with this number one yeah I know it i've been on on all sides of it and I've also run my own development company which which again it's it's funny I I hope that our audience is really inspired by that because anyone listening can to can build their own development company as well and and if you don't if you're if your husband. Isn't an architect which of course most most of our listeners don't have that in their immediate family go out and find an architect there are millions of them who absolutely are probably waiting for somebody to partner up with so it is it is something that again is a really smart way to sort of get involved with developers because then you get to say when you're pitching to other developers oh I do this also by the way maybe on a smaller scale or maybe on a different you know sector but this is what I know what you what you deal with it. I want to help you and I imagine that's a very powerful pitch. Yeah I certainly think it is but I also do you know I think that one thing I also believe strongly about being an agent or being a broker or a REALTOR it's a job and so I think it's it's important not to sort of look at it as something where you're also going to be doing this also going to be doing this like I think coming to do this. I think one of the best ways to sort of digest that is to make sure that you do understand that person's business just like a you know when you have a residential client who's looking for a new home knowing that they have family overseas who comes to stay all the time and they need a separate place for that person. To stay that feels a little separate and they've got space and they've got their own little kitchen like that if you don't know that you're going to show people the wrong thing and so I think understanding what how it works as a developer and the profit structure and knowing that if you only suggest the most expensive stage are they may feel like you don't have their interests at heart and you don't even understand. And what their business is and so I think it's really important to communicate that you will protect them by only coming to them with things that you have evaluated yourself and say oh hey the you know the juices worth the squeeze or whatever like we're going to spend $20,000 on this campaign. But I think ultimately it's going to translate into a 2% increase in sale prices, which is $200,000. So you know I think it's acknowledging that that's their money and you're not just going to spend their money because it's going to produce better material or sort you know so I think that's probably the most important part is just this understanding your client. Yeah, I agree. Yes, and again that's probably also the skills you developed as an attorney. It's probably incredibly helpful for how important it is to get a good sense of what the client wants and needs so that you know you can continue working for them in a way that that is most effective for them. Question about sort of today's market so we know of course everyone listening to the show knows rates have changed, doubled in a lot of cases, maybe even more than doubled at this point. Yeah, seems to change almost daily and I don't know what it's at today, but but it certainly has gone up. So rates are double what they were at the lowest point, which I don't think is maybe the best metric to measure against, but it's what people know because it was so prominent. So it's definitely featured in news and social media, how rates were so low and now people maybe feel oh I missed out except of course what they maybe don't always know is there were lots and lots of buyers and places prices were inflated and maybe it's not so different now even though rates have changed, but but they're just maybe a lot more sentiment out there that now's not the time to to make any big moves. So understanding that those are some hurdles that REALTORS are dealing with all over the country. How have you been dealing with that? How have you been educating your clients and just keeping your business going despite the fact that there probably are fewer buyers in the market at this point. I think that's absolutely true. They're definitely are fewer buyers and fewer real buyers because even if people I mean it's it's really hard even if people feel like real buyers if you were looking a month ago and then you went on vacation or something and came back and then you find something and then you get your pre approval updated. You know I think we're seeing that a lot we're seeing more deals fall apart and I think that's probably part of it is that people are not internalizing or properly sort of analyzing what these rate changes mean. But I will say I think it's really important to recognize that rates are fluid and they go up with they are very likely to come down again and so if you know I have this conversation with a few clients recently at many of whom said you know that's true. I really hadn't thought about it that way and of course when rates are super low you're really excited because you can lock in this rate for a long time and you know what your monthly outlay is going to be. But when rates are high it's important to remember it doesn't have to stay like that forever. And so you know real estate is a long term play almost no matter what and when you're buying a home maybe life does change and you end up selling it in three years. But you know I for most of my clients any clients who are not investors you know my recommendation to them is you can't really have any expectation of appreciation unless you plan to stay in this home for at least probably five years you never know and you need that flexibility on that because if the market's in the toilet five years you want to be able to hang on to it for another two or or you know move up. But it's a long term play and because rates we have seen have changed so quickly so dramatically we don't know what's going to happen and i'm not going to promise anybody that rates are going to go back down to you know three percent for 30 or fixed but I can tell people with some degree of confidence that I certainly think they'll go down again in a meaningful way over the course of the next two to three years. So I think it is an opportunity I think that that will take some time because sellers are having a hard time adjusting. So that's what I can't get twice the listing price. You know anymore or I can't get exactly the same price that they got down the street. Right and and then you know we work in we work in different markets we work across a lot of price points and for New York and you know I certainly recognize that and it's one thing we are seeing is the very high in Brooklyn in particular turnkey townhouse market it's stable. There aren't really many rental alternatives if you want a really nice townhouse in Brooklyn Heights there's not one to rent so you may still end up in the sale market. You know there's a lot of liquidity at that price point and so we are really having a hard time getting a meeting in the mines at that price point but things are staying pretty stable. You know lower price points people are a little bit more understanding that interest rates have really made a big hit and so you know I think I'm sure everyone's going through the same thing it's educating your sellers educating your buyers keeping buyers spirits elevated that what they're doing is good for the good for their themselves in their family long term. I think it seems like so many people and it's so because it oftentimes is buyers or you know largest asset or one of their largest assets it becomes this idea that it this primary residence is an investment and I think the REALTOR's could I'm curious to get your thoughts on this could really do their clients of favor by readjusting that expectation that number one. Yes okay maybe technically it's an investment but it's you have to live somewhere right so even if it does go up by you know two times what you paid for it odds are you're not downsizing on your next home that's not usually the sort of human nature psychology piece of it is it's like well I'm just going to bank this extra 500 grand I just made usually it's like now we can upgrade to a higher price point property maybe once somebody hits retirement age that changes and they down. Size and then yeah they can bank some of that money that's not usually what most people do with their profit from their primary residence at least that's not been my experience with anybody I know maybe maybe the most savvy people would do that but most of us you know we don't buy a 20 inch TV when we're you know a teenager and that's all we can afford and then when we're 40 we go you know let's go back to a 20 inch TV right it goes no I want the 65 inch or the 80 inch or whatever we keep going bigger and bigger until we realize maybe things are too big but but the point is is it's my sister did this she her place almost doubled in value in the West Village she was on Barrow which is like beyond amazing street you I'm sure you know it and then you know fifth floor walk up no air condition you know a little tiny union no amenities really I was a co-op and fifth floor walk up and it was like 475 square feet one bedroom that includes a one bedroom as just a little tiny nothing place but it was it was lovely but it was just tiny and everything was miniature and stuff and and then she she she took that money and then you know she goes well now I can't live in my neighborhood anymore because even though her she had made all this money she had actually priced herself out of her actual street and so she ended up moving to Queens with it with her fiance at the time and it ended up working out for them but but again people don't usually go from a 475 square foot you know co-op to well you know maybe I'll just stay at 475 square feet right she so this idea that people see their primary home as an investment I think can can be very problematic and and it's it's I think it's just not an investment maybe unless it is unless it is something that generates income or that you know you're going to move to an investment property at some point but but this idea that REALTOR can can really reeducate their clients about this this let's not think of this as an investment as much as a lifestyle and and quality of life sort of situation I think that would I think that would well and also dating the rate on the lending side marrying the home you know that's that expression that that it's it's sort of a cutesy expression that people say but it's a good expression because I think it's exactly right I mean rates do change people refinance and you know we're not in the double digits right it's not the early early eight late 70s early 80s anymore which that was a really difficult times I can't even imagine what it's like to try to be a buyer's agent when it's you know 12% rates but people were doing it then too so yeah anyway I've gone on enough of a rant about that but I really appreciate your thoughts about it because I think you know for anyone out there who's going gosh the buyers just aren't into it they feel like they're getting ripped off at this point time to reeducate yourself as the agent about how to have that conversation to say you know what even if you would have tried to buy a place two years ago you would have here's what you probably would have paid over asking for what you're looking for I'm going to show you evidence that would have suggested that you know maybe it wasn't such a great time for you or maybe it can still be a good time today and we can refinance in a couple of years if if need yeah so anyway I'm sorry I will get off of it so boxy brand there but I want I want agents to not be so so disheartening during this time and you have a billion dollar business that you've built and that is beyond impressive I want to ask sort of my last question which is so you talked about newsletters we talked about client relationships and how one can lead to one plus one you know can lead to to dozens and dozens and dozens what advice do you have for agents who want to further develop those those relationships make those more intimate make those more important really demonstrate value so that in between sales maybe those people again you mentioned newsletters keep your name in front but what else are you doing just so that the your clients don't forget about you or that they keep thinking about you when they're talking to other other people who might need your services. I am not as good at that as I should be quite honestly and in many ways because I've been fortunate in in building these relationships that largely feed themselves I mean and then New York Market it is a unique thing I know that it has remained strong in times when others have not been I think this COVID experience was really unique and I'm not sure what that is like that is the same thing I did before. In that it was one of the few times that we've seen you know somebody selling in New York and buying somewhere else and they don't come out ahead and not necessarily in actual like dollars in your pocket but in terms of the strength of the market that you know that you're getting top dollar in New York and you know that you're buying at a little bit of a discount wherever you may be going and that really got hooked on the head and that was a big adjustment but it was also a really interesting illustration of what drives people and people were buying because they wanted to move and so they were able to just say look this is what's right for me this is what I want and I'm going to do it and this is the price this is the price that it is today and so I think that it's important for people to remember that that the one and this touches on the what you were saying it's you're doing this for yourself and for your future self and for your family and you know you got to make the choice that's right for you that is somewhat untethered from is this the right investment and so and I'm going to I'm going to go back one second a little bit about that because I totally understand and agree with you that it is not exclusively an investment but I think another way to look at that and I've spoken of clients a number of times is it is a lifetime investment and very rarely are people selling and then renting unless it's sort of a temporary either move for one reason or another or renovation or relocation or whatever maybe you know a strategic decision but people are done really staying in the market so you know I we get so many people who say I can't lose money on this house well if you're selling at a discount whatever you're buying in all likelihood is also with that same discount it's a lifetime and so in your you know lifetime portfolio of real estate holdings you're probably going to come out ahead of the stock market historically that is what has happened and so I think don't like don't get so fixated on everyone transaction because that's not what it is it's a it's a lifetime of owning your home and there are ways to leverage that if you have a rental unit you can do a 1031 exchange and you feel like genius you know there's a lot of different ways to leverage real estate ownership and so I think that's important to to focus on also and frankly like you still do get that primary residence interstituction so I think that something we should really be focusing on right now too because if you're paying more you're getting a much larger deduction so that's something that's my that's my sort of call back to the last one. No I appreciate that and I I want to just wrap up because you have been this has been so valuable to our audience I always like you know when I first started this this show all these years ago it was like oh all of these top producers are going to have all of these very specific strategies and tips that the rest of us don't know about what I've learned after 400 episodes is that is rarely the case that there's like this little secret magic formula that you know we're going to unearth on this show and and and it hasn't happened yet but but maybe maybe in the next 400 episodes somebody will have that but the reality of it is it isn't much about that at all and it's more about consistency and discipline and also just understanding how people think who are really at the top of the mountain as a REALTOR And so I think you've given us today, you've given us some great strategies. But on top of that, just this idea of like, here's how I think about things, here's how I keep going. Because at the end of the day, sort of I think mindset, and again that word is I think really overused and it sort of doesn't even mean a whole lot anymore. But this idea of just the beliefs and the strategies that somebody has that, you know, like you were saying, Barbara Corcoran saying, there's always buyers and sellers. There's always a broker's market. It's about making sure that you can pivot and adjust to those changes. And I also want to mention that Lindsay is currently looking for one additional team member. Now this is a billion dollar team. So she doesn't of course take any and all agents that reach out to her. And in fact, you'd have to probably be somebody that is really impressive. And she did not say that to me. I'm saying it on her behalf. Because I know that she's going to expect somebody who is really somebody dynamic and special. But if you are a REALTOR in the New York market, specifically Brooklyn, Manhattan, anywhere there that you think you could be a value and you could be a valued member of her team, reach out to her. The best way to do that, just go to her website. You can submit some information. And also by the way, for everyone else who's listening who's a REALTOR, whether you're in New York or elsewhere in the country, if you have clients that are moving to the city, moving to Brooklyn, moving to other places in the New York metro area. And you're looking for a top producer to send them to. Well, obviously, Lindsay is a great choice. She's at an amazing firm. We've interviewed tons of people from Douglas Alman over the years. And they're always just really best of the best. Obviously, Douglas Alman's doing something right in their hiring. But also, if you are looking for a broker to refer to, Lindsay would love the opportunity to connect with you. Lindsay, what is the best way another agent can reach out to you? Website, definitely. And we have a team email, which we did by necessity. I, you know, over the years, sort of figured out some of the things. And everyone responding to the same email at once. And sometimes responding from my email. And then I also respond, gave rise to the LBB team email. So LBB team at Alman.com is probably the best way. And we'll post a link to that in the show notes as well. So if you are an agent that wants to partner with Lindsay with referrals or maybe you're looking to explore being on a team yourself and you live in that area, reach out to Lindsay to see if you might be a good fit for her. And by the way, she's not always hiring, like most real estate firms like our firm were always hiring. So you can always reach out to me if you want to join our company in Chicago. But Lindsay is not that, that kind of agent and doesn't have that kind of team. It's a very exclusive small team that she can really manage, you know, work with and make sure that, you know, all of her team members are having success. So definitely reach out to her if you think that would be a good fit. Lindsay, thank you so much for being on the show. We had, I had such fun time with you. You really, really appreciate how busy you are. And really just, again, walking away from a really, really sort of something that you would work so hard for and not walked away entirely, but walked away from that being your profession and your source of income is truly, you know, it's really, again, this courageous quality that you have, I think is amazing. And so I hope it's inspiring to our audience. And also we want to thank Lindsay for her time. We know how busy she is. And so on behalf of the audience, we say thank you to you. And also on behalf of Lindsay and myself, we want to thank the audience for not only sticking around throughout the whole episode, but also hopefully finding value here. And we just asked that you do one thing, which is tele-friend. Think of one other REALTOR that needs to hear this conversation that we just had and send them a link to our websites, keeping it realpod.com. We'll have that link to that in the show notes as well. But please tell other REALTORS about our show. It's how we've grown over the last five years now. And so we want to continue to grow and reach more and more REALTORS. So anyway, on behalf of everyone, Lindsay, thank you. And we will see everybody on the next episode. Thanks, Lindsay. Thank you.
