[00:01:34] Hello, Keeping It Real.
[00:01:35] I love being on the show because I make so many friends so don't forget to drop me
[00:01:39] a line on Instagram.
[00:01:40] We're linked in if you're there.
[00:01:42] Most people aren't Instagram if you're a real estate agent.
[00:01:44] It's at Kim KIM RITB ERG.
[00:01:48] Today I wanted to talk about accountability.
[00:01:51] So I work, I'm a video expert and a coach for real estate agents on how to show up better
[00:01:56] on camera, how to leverage video, how do you use social media to actually get clients.
[00:02:01] So one of the things I wanted to really focus on today is that accountability piece.
[00:02:05] And the reason why it's super, super important to discuss the accountability piece is you
[00:02:11] can know everything in the world.
[00:02:12] But if you don't have anyone keeping you accountable, then you're not going to get hit your goal.
[00:02:16] I recently read a stat that having an accountability partner increases your likelihood of being
[00:02:22] successful at your goal by 95%.
[00:02:26] I think I forget where I saw that stat, but it's a little just that.
[00:02:30] And what I have seen through leading video bootcamp, I lead this cohort of real estate agents
[00:02:38] and teaching them how to leverage video, how to explain your message, how to teach people
[00:02:43] why you're special, how to actually go on camera, connect with people, show them that you're
[00:02:47] credible and trustworthy and have them sign up with you to sell or buy their house.
[00:02:52] But an important part of it, and this is what I've learned basically over the last several years,
[00:02:56] I've led hundreds of people through my cohorts, is that without the accountability piece,
[00:03:01] it's kind of like a book sitting on your nightstand, right?
[00:03:04] Like a magazine sitting on your nightstand, you're not going to do it and put it into practice
[00:03:08] and you're not going to see the results without that accountability.
[00:03:11] So what does that mean?
[00:03:12] As you're doing video, I need you to have an accountability partner.
[00:03:17] So what that means for video content is, you know, even if you're not doing video, video, video
[00:03:22] and you're maybe just mostly posting photos or text, you know, text content, you really need
[00:03:28] an accountability partner to say, Hey, you said you're going to post every Wednesday.
[00:03:34] It's Wednesday. How's it going?
[00:03:35] So for an example, I'm working with a real estate agent team in New York City and, you know,
[00:03:40] one of their team members said, what do you think we should do about should we do it once a
[00:03:45] week or twice a week? And I said, identify one time a week. And this is for you listeners as
[00:03:49] well, identify one time a week every single week. You're going to focus on content. What does that
[00:03:54] mean? Depending on how much content you're making, that could be filming yourself.
[00:03:59] That could be writing some posts. That could be posting your posts, but you have to do something
[00:04:02] where you're actually making content and posting that content because it's not just going to,
[00:04:07] you know, what you're out of thin air, but it's a part of your business like everything else,
[00:04:11] just like you make time to do cold calls, just like you make time to do your accounting or hand
[00:04:15] that off, whatever. You have to schedule it in and build upon it. So what that looks like for
[00:04:22] some of my students, we, I have them pair up into pairs, pair up into pairs, obviously. I have
[00:04:26] them pair up and keep each other accountable to say, Hey, it's Wednesday. How did your shoot go?
[00:04:32] Or you were working on this? How's that going? And one thing I have right now, actually a brand new
[00:04:36] program I'm doing is called a seven day on camera challenge. And in seven days, I have,
[00:04:43] it's a course, a self-paced course. You can do it at your own time, Sunday night, maybe your night
[00:04:48] hour, four in the morning, maybe, maybe you want to do it on your lunch break, do whatever you want.
[00:04:52] It teaches you how to show up with confidence, what to say, and that accountability built in.
[00:04:59] So I'll be checking in with you on how you're doing on it. You'll be tagging me in your, in your
[00:05:03] videos. And the important thing is doing it, right? I don't want to teach people how to be good on
[00:05:08] camera and then then be like, Okay, that was nice. And then go back to their day. It is the
[00:05:12] accountability part of it that actually takes you from wanting something to doing something.
[00:05:18] I have so many clients, they come to me, I want to show up more on camera. I want to X, I want to Y.
[00:05:26] I'll teach you, we learn how to do it. And then we have to do it. And so that's why I built the
[00:05:31] seven day on camera challenge. It's brand new. It's really fun. I have people around the country
[00:05:34] doing it and they're tagging me and and dropping me notes on how they're on how it's going.
[00:05:40] And I, I just think sometimes we forget about that really important piece. You know, there's education,
[00:05:45] there's application, and there's accountability. So I'm going to give you this assignment for this
[00:05:50] week. I want you to show up on camera one time. And I want you to tag me KIM or ITTP ERG.
[00:06:01] Now, I find Instagram a really great place to start showing up on camera because of course,
[00:06:06] it has that opportunity where you are basically in, you know, Instagram stories, it disappears
[00:06:12] after 24 hours. So I really like that as a tool to start getting out the kinks when you start
[00:06:17] showing up on camera and maybe you're rusty, maybe you've never shown up before. It allows you
[00:06:21] that space to start showing up and it doesn't feel so permanent. So I love Instagram stories for
[00:06:26] that reason. And you'll see in the seven day on camera challenge, I will show you exactly how to
[00:06:32] film yourself, angles, how to use lighting and natural light. You don't even need tools,
[00:06:36] just you and your phone. But I tell you what to say and how to make content. And as a part of that,
[00:06:41] so I want you to show up here's your assignment when you show up on camera on Instagram stories
[00:06:45] this week tag me at KIM Ritberg. And I want you to tell me about one thing you're doing for your
[00:06:51] business this week. So that could be you visiting a new property. That could be you setting up for an
[00:06:58] open house. That could be that you handed the keys to a new client, hooray. It handed the keys over
[00:07:03] to a client who closed on their home. It could be anything, but I do want you to show up, talk to the
[00:07:09] camera and you can say, listen, a lot of people are like, oh, this is weird. Just say, I'm doing KIM Ritberg's
[00:07:13] on camera challenge. I'm showing up on camera because she's forcing me to, but I'm showing up on
[00:07:19] camera to let people into my business more. Here's something that's happening this week in my business.
[00:07:24] That's what I want you to say. Hi, my name is Jane. Hi, I'm Jane. I am on camera doing KIM Ritberg's
[00:07:31] on camera challenge. Something I'm doing for my business this week is setting up for an open house
[00:07:36] at a property I'm really excited about. Here it is behind me, or maybe you could record in your
[00:07:42] office. But if you're inside, you say here the the house is behind me, it looks awesome. And I can't
[00:07:47] make for people to come and check it out. So that's accountability in a nutshell. It's the baby
[00:07:52] steps of accountability, but it's really, really important. As always, I love hearing from you.
[00:07:58] So make sure to drop me a line at KIM Ritberg at KIM RITB ERG. And I'm going to link out that on camera,
[00:08:05] seven day on camera challenge. And I just love the keeping your real audience. It's just like, you
[00:08:10] guys are the best. I have so many friends around the country now from this. So have a great day.
