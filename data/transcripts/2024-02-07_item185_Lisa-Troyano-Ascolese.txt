[00:02:42] with Lisa Troyano Escalise.
[00:02:57] Today, I'm going to show our guest is Lisa Troyano Escalise. What was she's a broker owner? She's a
[00:03:03] podcast host. She's a top producer. She's a speaker. She's a total superstar in Hoboken as well
[00:03:10] as in Jersey City. She has two offices there. They service New Jersey. But let me tell you more
[00:03:16] about Lisa because she's really, really an amazing guest that we are able to have on the show.
[00:03:21] So Lisa describes herself as a serial entrepreneur. She is the sole owner, licensed partner and broker
[00:03:27] of record for Engle and Volker's Hoboken and Jersey City real estate brokerages as well as the
[00:03:33] My Homebooking real estate team leader. She recently released the first to market mobile staging app

[00:03:45] She's a podcast host, a public speaker and a decorated award-winning entrepreneur.
[00:03:50] Lisa thrives in purpose search, sorry, Lisa thrives in purpose searching and business creation

[00:04:01] studies. Lisa has risen in multiple organizations before leaving corporate America and following her
[00:04:06] dreams of working for herself. She began a career in real estate over 10 years ago, utilizing her

[00:04:31] estate market as a whole. Lisa continues to win awards for both real estate and entrepreneurship.
[00:04:37] To see all of the super cool things Lisa is up to, please check her website which is LTA-indivers.com.
[00:04:46] Literally everything she does is on there, but also I want you to follow her on Instagram.
[00:04:50] My homeboken so it's like my Hoboken, but HOME instead, we'll have a link to that as well in
[00:04:57] the show notes. Also, subscribe to her podcast which is called Breakfast with Brokers, which she does
[00:05:02] weekly and she interviews agents and basically talks about the market. Lisa, welcome to the show.
[00:05:08] Hi, thanks for that intro. That was awesome. You do a lot of things. I do a lot of things.
[00:05:13] I'm very impressive. Lisa, yes, I can appreciate that. We have one brokerage here. You have two
[00:05:23] brokerages. I can't even imagine doing two. We have one with just under 800 agents and that is
[00:05:29] keeping us very busy. The idea of having two, just oh, that just makes my head spin, but not only
[00:05:36] doing that, you're also hosting a show, you also on apreneur or speaker, you do it all.
[00:05:43] Most importantly, you develop agents. I want to talk about this because one of the most important
[00:05:48] or impressive things I saw from you is that not only did you purchase Engel and Volkers
[00:05:53] and you open these two offices, but you also tripled the production of those offices. Let's
[00:05:59] be honest, that is not easy to do. Engel and Volkers is already an amazing brand. We have them
[00:06:05] here in Chicago, clearly a name that people respect and admire certainly one of the white club firms.
[00:06:11] But to triple the production of any office, regardless of the name that's on the signout front,
[00:06:18] is I mean, I would love to triple our agents production. Tell me what you're doing or what you did
[00:06:25] because I think our show is all about agent development. Tell us how you think, well,
[00:06:31] before we get to that, I'm so sorry. I go to go with my first question. We will get to agent
[00:06:34] development second. Sorry, tell us how you got in the industry.
[00:06:38] Yeah, so actually ties well into your second question. I was in online advertising sales in
[00:06:45] Manhattan working for several Fortune 500 companies and I worked for an incredible man who
[00:06:51] was, had an open door policy. So I literally sat next to the CEO of the company in this giant
[00:06:58] loft. There were no doors. It was just, he had this great open air policy basically come in,
[00:07:02] pitch me whatever idea you might have and I'll critique it. I'll give you my feedback. He was a
[00:07:09] serial entrepreneur and just off the charts, brilliant. And I had this idea for like an event
[00:07:13] planning company and I went to him and I remember sitting across the table from him and he's going
[00:07:18] through my business plan. I'm like, what did I just do? I just gave my boss my exit strategy.
[00:07:23] Like this is the dumbest idea I fell right into it and like he closes it up and he was like,
[00:07:28] what's the problem? It's great. And I was like, well, I have a job here and he's like,
[00:07:34] I'm laying off half the company tomorrow. You're never safe when you work for someone else.
[00:07:38] And I was like, that's true. What? And he flat out said, I love dishonesty. He flat out was like,
[00:07:42] you don't make enough money. I'm not laying you off. But half the company will not be here tomorrow.
[00:07:47] Yeah. Well, it's an important thing, by the way, to realize that if you, for people that do have
[00:07:55] corporate jobs or maybe you're thinking about getting into real estate, I was one of those people
[00:07:59] who was very highly compensated at a tech firm prior to this. I had just gotten a perfect review.
[00:08:05] I had gotten a raise and then I got laid off a week later. Even though all signs pointed to
[00:08:10] I am doing great. But because I was so highly compensated, I was very easily, they could get rid
[00:08:16] of me pretty easily. So that's a really strong point. Yeah. And I went on to go through like six or
[00:08:21] seven rounds of layoffs. And then finally, they closed my division of the company. And I was out
[00:08:26] on the street. They had no money left. They didn't give me any severance. And I remember being like,
[00:08:31] I'm going to just get my, at the time, my late mother was a REALTOR. I was like, I'm just going
[00:08:34] to get my real estate license. All of my friends were moving a hobo again. I'll do a couple rentals
[00:08:38] and it'll pad the bills. And I remember jumping into it with, I had the, the event planning company
[00:08:44] that I was starting. And it's kind of started doing time. And I had to make a decision worth my time.
[00:08:52] I have kids once I'd or a million dollar condos on the other. And I was like, I'm going
[00:08:57] out of the cocktails. So I closed my company and I star time as a mom and pop company eventually
[00:09:04] bought the remaining owner out. And here we are. So real estate. Yay. Unbelievable. It's amazing.
[00:09:13] It is, it's funny how people get into this business. And then some, you know, ultimately become,
[00:09:19] you know, broker owners. So let's talk a little bit about agent development as we were, as I was
[00:09:26] getting to at the beginning and realized I hadn't properly sort of gotten your story. So how do you
[00:09:31] think about training? And again, Engle and Vokers is, is really a brand, at least here in Chicago.
[00:09:37] And I'm guessing in most parts of the, of the country where it's, I don't know that there's a lot
[00:09:42] of brand new agents who join Engle and Vokers. I know it's a lot of like, hey, once you get to a certain
[00:09:47] level, you know, that's, that's a place. And again, maybe they do train new agents as well. But
[00:09:51] regardless, as a broker owner, you are always wanting your agents to do better production, more
[00:09:55] production. And of course, you're there to guide them. So how do you think about that? And,
[00:10:01] you know, tell us like kind of what you're talking to your agents about right now is 2024. Just
[00:10:07] started. We had a tough year last year, at least here in Chicago. I know we did probably you guys
[00:10:11] dealt with the same high interest rates in low inventory that everywhere else did. So how are you
[00:10:16] thinking about this year? I'm cautiously optimistic. If you asked me that question, I think three months
[00:10:22] ago, I would have told you bad and the hatches and grab your helmets. And that's it. But I have to
[00:10:26] tell you, I think, I mean, our market's a little resilient in that regard. Like we get the, we're
[00:10:31] five minutes outside of Manhattan. You can get into Manhattan from Hoboken in four different ways.
[00:10:35] Like train bus boat, you know, Uber, we're right across the river. So for us, we always bounce back
[00:10:42] a little bit quick and we're about nine months out of Manhattan's market. So, or nine month lag,
[00:10:47] I should say, for Manhattan's market. So we have a nice like people are always moving in and
[00:10:51] moving out, moving in, moving out. So there's always like a decent amount of transactions for us.
[00:10:56] That being said, when we closed last year, there were 53 properties on the market for 60,000 people.
[00:11:02] And there's a thousand and 11 REALTORS that identify as Hoboken as their market. So the math is
[00:11:08] just not mapping. So it's, it's one of those situations where I think we're going to continue to
[00:11:14] see low inventory, anything that comes on the mark, gobbled up with multiple offers over asking.
[00:11:20] And I think the low inventory is really what's keeping us going and keeping that that study. But a lot
[00:11:25] of parts, like we serve as a New Jersey, a little bit of West and we serve South Jersey as well.
[00:11:31] Not all those markets, but certain pockets of those markets. And you know, we're seeing it across the
[00:11:36] board. So I think as long as demand remains that high, we will continue to, to have, you know, a
[00:11:43] healthy situation. We just need, we need a little bit more inventory. And I don't, I'm sure you guys
[00:11:48] are seeing the same thing by us. The issue is, you know, we have everybody that is stuck in these two
[00:11:53] and two and a half percent interest rates. And during COVID, all of the pricing shot up, I mean,
[00:11:58] our single family market in Hoboken went up 24% in two years. So now, you know, that brownstone
[00:12:05] that was 1.8 is, you know, significantly higher. Now you can't get anything decent for under 25. And
[00:12:13] you know, again, the math isn't math thing. It's like people are like, well, I'm just going to stay
[00:12:16] in my condo until these rates come down. So it's, I think if we see, if we just see a five, if we
[00:12:22] just see five, nine, nine, nine, nine, nine, nine, nine, nine, like just a five, I think we would have
[00:12:27] like a wild spring. But I don't know. I mean, now they're talking about. No one has the crystal ball.
[00:12:33] It's funny. I hear everyone's got their own number with their cogs to rates. I hear 6.3. Obviously,
[00:12:39] 5.9 would be amazing. We don't know. I'm actually going to see Lawrence Yoon, who's the NAR chief
[00:12:48] chief economist. And next week, I'm just lucky enough that he's in Chicago because NAR is here.
[00:12:54] Despite all of their problems, we're still having this market out there. No, we won't go there. There
[00:13:00] was, I don't know if you saw there was news yesterday about, yeah, every way. I'm very curious to
[00:13:05] see what that's about. But that's just the gossipy part of me. But anyway, I will get to chance to
[00:13:10] to come back and do an episode on what Dr. Yoon predicts for this year. He's usually fairly accurate.
[00:13:17] But this is a big problem, right? I think it's 85% yeah, 85% of US homeowners with a mortgage have
[00:13:25] less than 5% rate. So as you're saying, I mean, I'm at 2.9% like I'm not moving. Yeah, yeah. So,
[00:13:33] so it's a problem. But is there does the math work? And this is, I guess, the question in its
[00:13:39] market specific, but I'm curious, does the math sort of work when rates are where they're at now,
[00:13:45] just be oh, you're dealing with catalog of cash offers, I bet. So that made that may sort of
[00:13:51] negate what I'm about to say. But for non cash offers, I think now might actually be a decent time
[00:13:56] to buy because it rates do drop to the low sixes. It's going to be, it's going to be so much competition.
[00:14:04] I just wonder if people are going to be grow up vastly overpaying if they were to buy today.
[00:14:09] I mean, they're already on like three group chats with friends and family, like talking about my
[00:14:14] in-laws have a house that went up across the street from them. They live in a modest block
[00:14:18] back up to a commercial district like not cold to sack, like not like, you know, everyone's like
[00:14:24] and the house just hit for two eight and it's like, what's like it's I think everyone's already
[00:14:31] overpaying. I think everyone's really overpaying. But I also think that like to your point right now
[00:14:35] is a great time to buy because you have a little bit of leverage and you know, whatever's still
[00:14:40] sitting on the market right now might not necessarily be bad. It just might be, you know,
[00:14:45] it was mispriced or you know, it's not the typical, you know, all white modern farmhouse everyone
[00:14:52] wants. Like it just might be a little different that you could change. I think to your point,
[00:14:56] it's a great time to buy. I also want to talk a little bit about brokerages. So this is something
[00:15:03] we don't ever talk about on the show and being somebody who's in management at a brokerage,
[00:15:07] I think there's a lot of times a disconnect between what agents maybe expect from a brokerage
[00:15:13] and also just how brokerages work. I think I think one myth that I'd like as a broker owner,
[00:15:18] you can I probably appreciate dispelling is that the margins for brokerages are high. They're really
[00:15:27] not and you know, brokerages are in competition with other brokerages of course for commissions
[00:15:32] and everything. So, you know, we're at a situation where I think agents continue to like clients
[00:15:40] squeeze the agents, the agents squeeze the brokerages. You know, things are changing a bit. Do you
[00:15:45] do you think there's going and of course the lawsuits with respect to commissions? Do we do you
[00:15:50] think there's going to be like a massive change in the next several years with how agents are compensated?
[00:15:55] Obviously, it's a crystal ball question, but just curious about, you know, how it's all going to
[00:16:00] is. Are things going to fundamentally change? Do you think? I mean, I think yes, I think, I think,
[00:16:06] frankly, we're the last agency, the last industry that hasn't been shook up, right? We're the
[00:16:12] last ones that, you know, taxis had Uber and blockbuster had Netflix. You know, we're the last ones
[00:16:18] that really haven't had a major shake up. So, I think, I think, yeah, I think something's coming,
[00:16:22] what that is, to be honest, I have no idea. You're absolutely right. The margins, the margins are very
[00:16:27] thin for brokerages. I mean, I only have 33 agents across two brokerages and that's kind of by design.
[00:16:33] Sure. But to your point, more agents is more money, right? So, it's like, I think we, the power of
[00:16:41] the brokerage was diminished with certain models that emerged, not naming names, but the
[00:16:49] capping model. I think a lot of things were dangled in front of agents' faces. You should come
[00:16:55] here. You could make 95% of your commission. It's like, right, but now you have a bunch of people
[00:16:59] running around the industry that don't know what they're doing and have absolutely no one to call.
[00:17:02] I mean, there's a brokerage, and again, I would never call anyone out, but there's a brokerage
[00:17:06] where it took me two months to find the broker, two months, I'm where to send the check. Like,
[00:17:12] I mean, really? So, I think, to a point, and this is a good segue into your other questions,
[00:17:17] I think everything's going to go back to some level of basics. And you hear Tom Ferry talk about it,
[00:17:22] you hear Bafini talk about it, but there's going to be some level of back to basics. And I think what
[00:17:26] what we offer and what I'm sure you do as well is, you know, you need some sort of guidance.
[00:17:31] You need somebody I came up with a mentor perspective where I could call that person at 9 p.m.
[00:17:37] or I can call him at mid-died or I can call him a one in the afternoon and he picked up. And that's
[00:17:40] 100% why it became a successful agent quickly because I had answers to questions.
[00:17:47] Yeah, I can't think of anything more important for an agent who's newer or just looking to
[00:17:53] increase production is having somebody who's either doing slightly better than they are or who's
[00:17:58] just an industry veteran who can say like, here's how to do it, call me when you need help. And
[00:18:02] brokerages, I think, are a lot of them are starting to move more towards the team model, which
[00:18:08] teams a lot of times can pick up the slack of where a brokerage may be smaller, maybe doesn't have
[00:18:14] as much support or training. I'm seeing that a lot happen here in our in our market here a lot of,
[00:18:20] we're seeing a lot of brokerages step away from training and kind of put that on the laps of
[00:18:25] the team leaders. So that's kind of interesting. But again, there's quality control issues with that,
[00:18:31] I'm sure, depends on the team, of course. But the idea of just having a mentor is so critical.
[00:18:37] We are actually finally putting a true mentorship program together this year in our brokerage.
[00:18:43] It's taken us a long time and it's really tricky as you know mentorship programs are tricky because
[00:18:48] you know, you don't want to give your agent that just joined you a bad experience. At the same time,
[00:18:53] you're putting a lot of trust into the whoever the mentor is. And at the same time, you have to figure
[00:18:58] out how you're constantly communicating with both to make sure that everybody's happy and getting what
[00:19:03] they need. And of course, you know, that, but that's what a brokerage should be doing. That's literally
[00:19:07] part of the job if that's something they offer. Or if they don't offer that, you know, they should
[00:19:12] have, hey, if you call between this time and this time, you're going to get one of us on the phone,
[00:19:16] we're here to help you. We, you know, we, we are, we're here to help. But not every brokerage is
[00:19:20] like that. I, I will say this to anyone listening. If you are somebody who is calling and you don't
[00:19:26] get good responses, this is the year to maybe explore other options. See what other firms offer because
[00:19:33] mentorship support training, these are the things that you are paying for for your brokerage.
[00:19:37] Please, please, please take advantage of them. Yes, if you're going to a firm that doesn't have
[00:19:42] these things, but they offer you like the highest commissions, okay, fine, you get that that's a trade
[00:19:46] off. But really understand that there are other solutions out there. And maybe it makes sense to
[00:19:51] earn less commission if you're getting better, of course, better training and support. What are you
[00:19:57] encouraging your, what about fundamentals? What are you encouraging your agents to do this year,
[00:20:02] just to sort of stay busy, you know, we can't control the interest rates or the market inventory,
[00:20:08] but we can control our, our actions. So just curious on what you're seeing successful agents do
[00:20:13] right now. Yeah, I mean, I think we're, we're actually approaching it from like a three-prong
[00:20:18] approach. So basically, we're, we're looking at the people that actually have to move. So I'm
[00:20:23] encouraging them to develop relationships with, you know, attorneys that might handle trust in
[00:20:27] the state work, attorneys that might handle, you know, divorce, you know, really get in touch with
[00:20:35] old, like retirement communities and let, you know, if you have somebody moving in, they most likely
[00:20:41] have to sell something. I mean, really acting as an advisor for these people that are going through
[00:20:46] a very scary transition in their life. Like, I think this country doesn't do a good job of kind
[00:20:50] of protecting our elderly people. And it's a scary time for them, right? And they're saying, I just
[00:20:55] saw another professor, I don't remember the name, but it was like, they're calling the silver tsunami.
[00:20:59] And it's like most of the transactions that will happen in the next five years are people over 65
[00:21:04] caching out. And I think the best thing you can do or any agent can do is really start to make
[00:21:10] relationships in that realm. That's certainly something I never knew anything about. And now I have
[00:21:15] wonderful relationships with divorce attorneys and trust in the state's attorneys. And, you know,
[00:21:20] that sort of thing. I think that's going to be key going forward because they so many of those
[00:21:24] baby boomers are caching out in the next couple of years. Oh, yeah. Great, great, great pointly says.
[00:21:30] So everyone listening, if you do not have relationships with divorce attorneys, estate planning
[00:21:35] attorneys, accountants, financial advisors, these are all people that deal with a lot of times
[00:21:44] as someone's entire net worth. And so they know they understand the situation. Somebody is having
[00:21:49] a life event change or inheriting a bunch of money, maybe from a parent who is, you know, passed away,
[00:21:54] baby boomers, baby boomers are going to be transferring a trot on trillions of dollars down to
[00:22:00] over the next handful of years to their siblings or sorry, their offspring. And this is the time
[00:22:08] to build those relationships so that when it maybe even becomes a tax advantage reason why somebody
[00:22:14] buys or sells or puts something in a trust that you're their person. So now's the time to start
[00:22:20] reaching out to those providers and start saying, I want to build a relationship with you. I want to
[00:22:24] learn, you know, how can I send you business? And, you know, here's what I look for. And you can
[00:22:29] also to be like to be I'm sorry to interrupt you to be ethical about it, you know, it's a scary time.
[00:22:34] I think there, you know, that generation is very, runs out to get their money, you know, so it's
[00:22:38] one of those things to like to really approach it from like a place of assistance and a place of
[00:22:42] helping and be like, we're going to make sure that everything's safe and your kids get everything
[00:22:46] and you're happy. And, you know, just being an ally in that process that is, and to me sounds
[00:22:51] terrifying, you know, I think that's going to go a long way and it's actually doing something nice
[00:22:56] with what we're doing, you know, so it's I think it's a great, great option. It's an amazing
[00:23:00] option. I'm so glad you you mentioned that because we are fiduciaries. So we are responsible
[00:23:07] for making sure we're doing what's in our client's best financial interest. And as Lisa just said,
[00:23:12] it's really the right thing to do. So I would say in every conversation with every client conversation
[00:23:18] at some point, say, hey, by the way, do you have somebody managing your estate? Do you have a will?
[00:23:24] Do you have some of this setup? It not that you have to get involved as the agent, but you just
[00:23:28] want to say, I just want to make sure everything's protected and that we're doing things in the right
[00:23:31] way. Even if it's just to show that you care that even just saying that demonstrates, I care about
[00:23:37] your situation. And I know people that can help with this. If you need that, you have a good account,
[00:23:42] and you have a good financial advisor. Do you have enough insurance? Are you covered in everything?
[00:23:45] Even though yes, we're selling homes, we want to make sure that this home fits into your financial
[00:23:50] plan. I bet if an agent would say that to a potential client and maybe they're interviewing
[00:23:56] three or four other real tours as well, I bet those other agents probably wouldn't bring up those
[00:24:02] kind of things because it gets tricky where you don't have to answer those questions when they're
[00:24:06] like, well, what about this? They say, hey, that's not my area of expertise, but I have people that
[00:24:11] can help that can help you with that. Or let's just get everyone on the same page.
[00:24:15] Yeah, totally. From a marketing perspective, because that's your background, I want to talk about
[00:24:21] what marketing strategies do you see working like right now? What do you see agents doing that's
[00:24:28] successful? Maybe what do we see agents doing that you sort of shake your head and go, you know,
[00:24:32] not a good idea? Yeah, I think, you know, this whole concept of agents having to be their own
[00:24:38] social media marketers, I think some are born for this. I think some need to hire someone.
[00:24:45] I think it's along the, you know, I think you have to find a place and this is one thing that we
[00:24:50] do offer is like that you can stand out, right? And I think a lot of agents, there's a lot of ego
[00:24:54] involved in this business. I mean, I'm sure you've seen it and you know, and there's part of that
[00:24:58] that's actually really great because it allows these agents to kind of, you know, create this persona
[00:25:03] and they create this whole business surrounding that ego and it's wonderful. It can also go in a very
[00:25:07] bad direction. So I think it's, I think it's one of those things where find, find a way that you
[00:25:12] can create a platform for yourself where you stand out because like I said earlier, we have a
[00:25:16] thousand eleven REALTORS that identify with Hoboken as a pro, that's insane. We're one square mile.
[00:25:20] So you really need, I think 70, 78 of us do the most work. You need a way to stand out. I mean,
[00:25:27] social media is still free, which is crazy to me. Like that, I mean, the fact that people aren't
[00:25:32] diving into that, diving into AI in certain ways. Like there's so, that's the fun part of this,
[00:25:38] I think. Like come up with creative videos, come up with creative videos for yourself, not just for
[00:25:43] properties, you know, market yourself through video. If you're sending, don't just send emails,
[00:25:48] what's an open rate for an email now? It's like nothing, you know, if you send it with a video on
[00:25:53] it that's somewhat interesting or directed to that person. So we're doing a lot of that. We're doing
[00:25:57] very targeted marketing. We also utilize our network. So Angle and Vokers is in 33 countries
[00:26:04] around the world. And we actually work very well together. You mentioned the one in Chicago.
[00:26:08] I think we just sent him something a couple weeks ago. Like we worked very well on the referral
[00:26:12] side of things and we double down on that because we do have a great relationship with the shop. So
[00:26:17] I think, you know, kind of find your niche and then get it out into the world. I also think,
[00:26:22] and this is a buzzword. So I hate to, I can watch my agent, Tom Worley rolling his eyes right
[00:26:29] now if he's ever listening to this is the term authentic. I think we were being authentic before
[00:26:35] authentic was cool. And I think that's key. Like you're, this is, you know, we did this all the time,
[00:26:40] we're doing multiple transactions a month, all that stuff. But we forget that a lot of times this,
[00:26:44] this is like the most important transaction for someone. So now they are renting a Bentley and
[00:26:50] driving around the street like acting like you, you know, that does nothing for anybody. You know,
[00:26:55] it's, it's you want to authentically present a home authentically present yourself and kind of
[00:27:00] cut away with all that craziness. Like I think that's a big trend that's going to go, Hey,
[00:27:05] why are you the days of, you know, rolling up to the estate in the Maclaren, I think you're done.
[00:27:10] I think it's, you got to do something a little bit more authentic.
[00:27:14] I think you're right. And good riddance to those days, in my opinion, because, because,
[00:27:18] well, and there's nothing, you know, again, everyone's different and cheers to the people that do
[00:27:23] that. And I'm not here to disparage them. But, but I think authenticity, the way I think about it is
[00:27:30] skills. Are, well, honesty and skill. So it's like, are you actually telling the truth? Are you
[00:27:36] presenting your actual self? And are you good? Are you actually useful to the agent? And the useful
[00:27:44] agents always do business. It's, it's funny. It's, and you guess you have to have a good marketing
[00:27:48] plan and you have to, there's more to it than just being good. But being good is really the,
[00:27:52] the most important thing. And it's, this is the year to sharpen skills because, as I'm sure you're
[00:27:58] seeing this in your market, you know, yeah, there's a thousand agents who identify, you know,
[00:28:02] as Hoboken, but I'll bet you by the end of this year, there won't be a thousand agents. I'll
[00:28:05] bet you there'll be a lot fewer. And the agents that are, are still around and doing all of those
[00:28:10] things to sharpen their skills and keep their marketing strong are going to gobble up market share.
[00:28:15] I mean, I certainly hope that's what happens because we certainly could use in this industry,
[00:28:20] you know, some agents probably do need to leave the industry, but not of your own fault. Maybe
[00:28:25] they were never trained well. Maybe they don't, it's just not really their job. But we're going to
[00:28:29] see, I mean, we're already seeing it. We have a holding company for agents that don't actively
[00:28:33] practice. We started it like 10 years ago, just like, as a kind of a goof like, well, I guess we
[00:28:38] should have a hold of company started with one agent. Now we have a thousand agents in there.
[00:28:42] In the last, in the last year, we've seen 200 people join our holding company, not like from
[00:28:47] our firm, over to our holding just in the whole state of Illinois. So we're seeing huge people
[00:28:53] leaving, which should be very actually both scary and very exciting to anyone listening to this
[00:28:58] because exciting because you're going to have more opportunity, scary because it could happen
[00:29:02] to you too. So I think it's important that if you just keep doing the right things and learning,
[00:29:09] I don't see any reason why somebody wouldn't be successful. But I like it. So we talked about social
[00:29:14] media. Yes, of course, videos, but you know, and right now, I think we think about how do I be
[00:29:19] useful on social media? There's all sorts of ways to do that. You know, pick a micro market,
[00:29:24] a some sort of geographic area and do videos about that area and highlight the restaurants. And the,
[00:29:30] I mean, you could do all sorts of fun things that are really useful to the community. And then you
[00:29:36] could then go into those like restaurants and say, Hey, I just made a video about you guys here.
[00:29:40] I just want to let you know I'm going to tag you. You guys, if you want to send it out, that'd be great too.
[00:29:43] And there's all sorts of ways to get immersed in the community. But I think that's that's going to be
[00:29:47] the key is getting back to those basics of getting involved in the community, learning your skills. But
[00:29:54] but I am curious, you know, what what, you know, are you seeing anything else like our,
[00:29:58] are you seeing traditional mailers, for example, I'm hearing of agents going back to doing a lot of
[00:30:04] physical mailers. To me, the mailer thing, I've never, I've never got it. I'll never be a
[00:30:10] proponent of it. I know they're success with it. I know you have to do it like 45 times upside
[00:30:14] down, hanging from a lock of hair. I don't know. Everybody talks about it. Like it's the gods gift to
[00:30:20] our business. I don't get it. I have agents that do it. And I support that. I love it. To me,
[00:30:26] it's so much money. It's just it's just litter. And I'm not, you know, I'm not saying like from
[00:30:33] a environmental perspective, it's just, I mean, I personally get like six a week. And so it's,
[00:30:39] and I'm an agent. So it's like, to me, I don't know, I don't get the mailer thing. I get that it
[00:30:45] works. And if that's your, if you swear by it, by all means, die on that hill. But for me, I don't get
[00:30:50] the mailer thing personally. I think your way better utilizing video in unique ways. I, I,
[00:30:57] I sent out a text yesterday. I went through all of my old landlords and gave them a video just
[00:31:02] saying, Hey, you may have made a lot of money. Like let me, you know, let me know if, if you have
[00:31:06] any interest in selling because this is the difference of what you could make. And here's a net proceeds
[00:31:10] worksheet. And blah, blah, blah. I have like six meetings next week, just from doing that. And it's,
[00:31:14] I don't have a ton of landlords. You know, I have maybe like 20, 20 to 30 landlords. And I have
[00:31:18] six meetings. I mean, that's a huge return. So I feel like huge. That sort of thing. I think we
[00:31:24] need to get creative. And I think we're going to need to learn how to serve in videos. I think
[00:31:29] video and social or anything you can do from text messaging is, is fantastic.
[00:31:35] Yeah. And I love that with text messaging with systems like bomb bomb or loom, where what's really
[00:31:41] cool. If, if anyone listening hasn't explored those, what's really neat is if you know somebody with
[00:31:46] one of those accounts, have them send you one just as a test because what's cool is they'll take a
[00:31:50] video. And this really, you can send it if you're like iPhone to iPhone or I don't know what it
[00:31:57] looks like for Android. But what's cool is it will literally take the video that you make and create
[00:32:02] like a little Jeff three second Jeff. And then it'll send it to the person. And then you know,
[00:32:07] it'll, they'll see that they have a video for them right in their text message. And they're more
[00:32:11] likely to click on it. We sent an email. We sent an email to all 700 plus of our agents announcing
[00:32:19] we have a new managing broker, which is a very big deal for us. And so we sent out an email on
[00:32:23] Sunday, which is not the best data, you know, send out an email. But to all of our agents, they
[00:32:28] say, Hey, just FY this big long thing. Here's our new managing broker, welcome, etc. And then we
[00:32:33] sent an SMS on Monday to just with a video. And we were curious to what got the higher open right.
[00:32:40] We knew text messages were would, but it was night and day difference. We had almost a 50%
[00:32:48] almost 50% of our agents clicked on the link in the text message about 15% of our agents clicked
[00:32:54] on the link in the email or open the email, even open the email. And maybe that says more about how we
[00:32:59] communicate via email than anything. But it's just the way it is. I mean, people are, well, you know,
[00:33:04] this nobody reads the email. You're a broker owner. You know how it goes. So this idea of
[00:33:09] utilizing SMS in a way that's not invasive, that's not overly communicative, but like providing value
[00:33:19] is amazing. It's such a great creative way. And people don't probably want to take your phone calls
[00:33:23] all the time either, right? So that's a great way to sort of have a conversation without having a
[00:33:28] conversation is you're like, Hey, I just, you know, here's a, you know, let's take a look at your
[00:33:31] property and see if it's a good time to sell. Yep. 100%. I mean, even if you like from a brokerage
[00:33:36] perspective, even recruiting, I mean, I have a great relationship with some of my best agents and they
[00:33:41] show me the text messages they get these campaigns that these, it is wild. I mean, you'll have like,
[00:33:46] Hey, want to work here? And they're like, no thanks. And they're like, Hey, but you really should work here.
[00:33:49] And they're like, no thanks. And he's like, please work here. It's like, Oh my god. And it's like
[00:33:55] relentless. I mean, to the point where I think it almost turns them off. Like totally, you know,
[00:33:59] it's, I don't know, I think there's an art to it. And I think that's, that's really going to
[00:34:03] separate like who makes it through this next transition is who can figure out what that art is and
[00:34:09] how you can do it authentically to yourself and, and really utilize these because there are so
[00:34:15] many tools that I mean, I don't even know if you dove into AI at all, but like I try and do like
[00:34:20] a little each week because it is the stuff you can do with that is incredible. I mean, you know,
[00:34:26] the most obvious application or the first one I had heard of was drop in your listing description
[00:34:33] and it'll rewrite it. And you know, you'd tell it to rewrite it in a particular way. You can also
[00:34:37] tell it to abide by, you know, whatever rules are applicable in your particular state or
[00:34:44] federal rules around making sure it's not a housing violation. But, but yes, you can do that. That's
[00:34:49] sort of, I think most people know about that stuff now. But what if you were like, I don't have
[00:34:53] anything to do for the next two days because I don't have any client appointments, you could
[00:34:57] literally ask Chad GBT, hey, I'm a REALTOR. I have the next two days free and I my goal is this. I
[00:35:04] want to, you know, reach out to Ted new people or whatever. And please give me ideas about how to
[00:35:09] do that. It will literally give you ideas. So you don't even have to come up with your own ideas
[00:35:14] anymore, which I think is so cool. And, and yeah, so utilize AI. I think of it as like, I don't
[00:35:22] remember if it's the Odyssey or whatever. There was a, the Oracle at Delphi, I think it may be
[00:35:26] for the Odyssey. Anyway, anyway, whatever. It's an old Greek mythology thing. But the Oracle
[00:35:30] Delphi was this thing, you know, you could ask anything for it. It would tell you the answer.
[00:35:33] I feel like Chad GBT is our version of that. It's not perfect. But it can do a lot of cool things. So
[00:35:38] you start talking to it. Yeah. And start asking questions and asking for help like, hey, help me
[00:35:44] market this property. What? Oh, there's something really cool you could do that I'll mention real
[00:35:47] quick. I just learned about this. You can put it, I did this for myself because I wanted to see
[00:35:51] the building I live in is only three years old. It's a brand new development or new wish. And so
[00:35:57] I said, I wonder what Chad GBT, which I don't even use the paid version. I have like the free version,
[00:36:01] which only goes back to like 2020 or something. So it scours the web, but it only scours it, I think,
[00:36:08] through like 2020. I don't think there's anything more current than that in, in its database, although
[00:36:12] I may be wrong. Anyway, I said, I wonder what Chad GBT knows about my condo unit or my building.
[00:36:18] And I said, Hey, I live at this address, tell me everything you know about it, which I was just
[00:36:22] interested to see it knew what kind of countertops I had. It knew the pricing. Oh, it was wild. Because
[00:36:29] what it did, it had probably scraped the website that was for my building when when building was
[00:36:34] selling units or I don't know where grab the data from it didn't say, or maybe it did, but I didn't
[00:36:39] look. But regardless, it knew everything. And I thought, if I was an agent practicing, I would put
[00:36:44] this in before every listing. Because maybe there'll be some fun little facts and things to know
[00:36:49] about the property that you would never know, or maybe even a listing agent doesn't know. And,
[00:36:53] you know, you'll just learn it knew when it was built, it knew, it just knew everything. It knew
[00:36:58] what the average price points were. I was so cool. So, you know, if you should do that before every
[00:37:03] listing, just to find, or if there's nothing that if it doesn't know anything about the property,
[00:37:08] I would say, well, tell me some cool things about the neighborhood that maybe a perspective buyer
[00:37:12] would want to know. Like, where's the cool restaurants, whatever, it could be anything. So, yeah, AI,
[00:37:19] absolutely. It's very cool. It's very scary, but it's very cool. What do you think there's going,
[00:37:26] what do we think about commissions? Now, I know New York, New Jersey, you know, you're you guys have
[00:37:32] a very unique market there. But do we think agent commissions are going to change? Do we think,
[00:37:39] do you are you seeing a trend where listing commissions are coming down, going up, staying the same,
[00:37:45] just curious? I mean, we what I'm seeing or what I ended up finding out, we started to see where
[00:37:51] that buyer's agents were only getting 2%. So, usually in our market, it's a five or six percent
[00:37:56] listing and we usually split it in half to 1,2 and a half to the listing agent, 2 and a half to
[00:38:00] property brokers. When I started to see was more and more 2% listings and it coincided around the
[00:38:06] time that all these lawsuits happen, which don't even get me started on those. But that so when all
[00:38:12] that so I was like, oh, maybe it's a reflection of that. Maybe point people aren't willing to give it
[00:38:15] out. When you actually looked at the hudds and the closing disclosures, you were seeing that the
[00:38:20] listing agent was keeping 3 and only giving out to. So, I think there's going to be a little bit,
[00:38:25] I think listing agents are probably going to have a little bit more control over where that
[00:38:29] distribution lies. And we started doing it here for some properties because to be honest,
[00:38:36] there was so much like tumultuous like fighting over deals. I don't it was a post-COVID thing.
[00:38:43] I don't know if everybody was just inside for too long. I don't know what happened. But like,
[00:38:46] it was like two months ago, I spent the entire day arguing over a refrigerator. This guy just
[00:38:50] took his sub-zero refrigerator and just rolled it out the door. It's not like on a refrigerator.
[00:38:57] It's a $10,000 item. Like we have a problem here. It's like, sue me. It's so like contentious.
[00:39:03] So, I think that if you and the listing agent have that shined, okay, well, here I'm going to give
[00:39:10] in like 2,000 of my allows you to kind of control the deal a little bit more and keep things going.
[00:39:15] I mean, I think the other thing is too, listing agents, it's not a slam dunk now, to sell or it
[00:39:20] won't be. So, I think we're going to have to do way more marketing. I think we're going to have to
[00:39:24] do way more higher end videos and higher end promotion. And so, that is costly. So, I could see
[00:39:32] that being more of a shift that I'm not necessarily worried about, but vigilant of.
[00:39:37] Whether or not there's not going to be buyer's agency, I don't know. I mean, I think it's really
[00:39:44] doing the whole industry into service and the seller into service to just eliminate buyer's
[00:39:49] agency being paid. I think people think that REALTORS get paid too much, but if they actually
[00:39:54] saw what was going on in the back end, they would be appalled. I had multiple people this year.
[00:39:59] Be like, I don't know why you do this. It's like, what? And they couldn't, you know, my clients
[00:40:06] know how hard I work and they're happy to pay the fees. I haven't honestly had pushed back on fees
[00:40:11] in years. But who knows? You know, the more that these crazy lawsuits get published, it's a
[00:40:17] sad state of affairs. I think they, you know, people, well, I'll leave it at that. I think it's
[00:40:24] it's more along the lines of like a mental situation, a mental health situation than it is
[00:40:29] anything else. But yeah, I agree. I think people that have really worked with a good REALTOR
[00:40:33] really know how much work is done and how much we do to keep the deal together. So I think
[00:40:38] at the end, I think that'll prevail. I do think we're going to go through a weird time of
[00:40:43] justifying our fees, but I think at the end, we'll be fine. I think so too. And I think this is
[00:40:48] where skill just kind of wins the game. If you're worried about, if you're, if you're getting pushback
[00:40:53] on your commissions, to me, I would see that as an agent. I would see that as feedback that maybe
[00:40:58] I'm not communicating my value proposition as well as I could be. And really saying, here's why,
[00:41:05] in fact, if I was an agent, I would just say, I would explain to you how I get paid. I would
[00:41:09] explain to you exactly how it works. And I want to explain why it's where, why I believe it's worth it.
[00:41:15] And, you know, I mean, you don't have to have that conversation every time. But for anyone that's
[00:41:19] on the fence, I mean, this is kind of the lawsuits were kind of about this where, you know,
[00:41:25] commissions were kind of nebulous and kind of confusing. And nobody really understood them,
[00:41:29] except the agents, because it wasn't super obvious who was paying the commissions and how it all
[00:41:33] works. But this is a great opportunity to get ahead of it and really just explain it to buyers,
[00:41:37] say, okay, technically, you're not paying a commission, except you are paying a commission.
[00:41:40] And let me explain how it's all baked into the price and everything. So you get a better sense of
[00:41:44] where it comes from and how it all works out. I think, you know, just agents explaining things
[00:41:49] better is always a win. And I think, at that, to your point, I think they're not, you're not going
[00:41:55] to get as much pushback. I think when it's more confusing, I think that's people are like, wait a
[00:41:58] minute, what am I paying? Like, it's like when I go into buy a car, which I like never do, because it's
[00:42:02] such a bad experience buying a car. At least I feel. Yeah, you always feel like you're getting ripped off.
[00:42:08] Like nobody ever is like, here's, okay, here's what I'm going to make if I sell you this car. Like,
[00:42:13] I'm happy to say if somebody's like, hey, I make 400 bucks each time I sell a car, I need to
[00:42:18] up this by 400 bucks so I can make it. Like I get it. Like we can have that conversation. I'm not
[00:42:23] I'm not a monster. But if I feel like you're ripping me off, now I'm not, now I don't trust you.
[00:42:29] Or if I feel like I don't know the real story, now I'm like, well, now I don't know who to believe.
[00:42:33] So I think with REALTORS, we don't think fully we are not, we are not cars. There's nothing wrong
[00:42:37] with car salesmen. I love, I love good car salesmen. But we know that the stigma in the industry is,
[00:42:42] I don't, I think I'm getting ripped off. I don't know. So we don't want that, you know, that same
[00:42:46] stigma here. And I think a lot of it's just explain, explain, explain, explain, explain tell everybody
[00:42:50] how it works. There's no secrets anyway. I mean, it's not anything to be at the nearest about.
[00:42:56] Who isn't looking at the HUD and notice it like, obviously we're a massive line item. But it's also
[00:43:02] like, like what I started to do now is literally lay out before I start working with someone,
[00:43:08] exactly what's going to happen the entire transaction and exactly what we're going to do for you
[00:43:12] on each side. And I, like I said, I've never had anyone push back ever. I should say ever the past
[00:43:19] like three or four years when it's really been a question, you know, but to your point, yeah,
[00:43:24] transparency. I agree. We should also mention I didn't do a great job of this on this episode,
[00:43:30] but I do want to mention that Lisa, you know, she, look, she owns two white glove brokerages in
[00:43:35] Jersey City and Hoboken angle invulkers. If you don't know them, they're amazing. They're really,
[00:43:41] really at the top of the, at the top of the mountain for, for these, you know, high,
[00:43:47] they attract very high producers. They also develop people into high producers. It's just a good
[00:43:52] company. So if you are in those areas and you're an agent, now again, company like ours, we hire
[00:43:59] tons and tons of people, but Lisa's a little bit more, she's, she's, she and her team are very
[00:44:06] careful about who they bring on board because they want, they want to develop you or they want to
[00:44:10] bring you on and find a solution for maybe an issue you're having at your current brokerage. So
[00:44:15] if you're like, I would like to work at a place like that where by the way, when Lisa came on board,
[00:44:20] she tripled production. That would be pretty cool if you're an agent. So how about checking out
[00:44:24] what Lisa has to offer? So Lisa, if there is an agent out there that's interested and by the way,
[00:44:31] guys, I want to also talk about if you're a New York agent, or just a second, but if somebody's
[00:44:35] thinking about maybe making a switch, Lisa, what's the best way they should reach out to learn
[00:44:39] about your brokerage? Yeah, I mean, you could reach out to me personally. It's info at myhomeboken.com.
[00:44:44] You could text me, 2012132617 or you could actually, I'm on social constantly. Obviously, like I
[00:44:52] said earlier, it's a big focus for us. So you could DM me at at my homeboken. So m y h o m e b o k e n
[00:45:00] dot com. And then our, if, go ahead, sorry, our brokerage account is at e v hoboken jc. So you
[00:45:08] could do that one too. But either way, we'll have links to all that in the show notes. Thank you
[00:45:12] for that. And also want to mention too that for agents that are in other parts of the country that
[00:45:18] have clients that maybe move to New York, I mean, Hoboken and Jersey City are really considered
[00:45:23] New York at this point. It's becomes, you know, a very desirable area, regardless of what
[00:45:29] somebody's price points may be, those are included in the sort of Manhattan sort of market. So
[00:45:35] if you have it clients that are moving into New York, reach out to Lisa because her team focuses
[00:45:42] on the Jersey side. Do you guys do New York as well? Or just the Jersey side? We have a great
[00:45:47] relationship with our New York office. So we actually have, we can, and our Brooklyn offices.
[00:45:50] So we actually, we can help you, you know, if we could actually do look at 360 approach, we can
[00:45:55] give you some options in New Jersey that we think are comparable to New York. And then, you know,
[00:45:59] we can send you to New York agents and they can handle it as well. So yeah, by all means, if
[00:46:02] I'm the starting point, that would be great. So it can. And if you're, if you're somebody where
[00:46:08] people from those areas move to retire to probably going somewhere further south and warmer,
[00:46:15] if you are in one of those markets where fed from those areas, another good person to reach out to
[00:46:20] to say, Hey, I bet you have people that are moving. Let's figure out a way to mutually benefit
[00:46:24] each other. So reach out to Lisa and overseas. I put nine families overseas last year. Nine.
[00:46:31] We have an overseas component. Like we always do a decent amount overseas. Nine is insane.
[00:46:37] That's incredible. So reach out to Lisa. Also, I want you to subscribe to her podcast, which is
[00:46:43] breakfast with brokers. You can find it anywhere podcasts are served and follow her on Instagram
[00:46:49] on all the social platforms. My home, Boken will have the link to that in the show notes. Lisa,
[00:46:55] thank you so much for being on our show. We greatly appreciate your time. You're amazing.
[00:47:01] Total superstar Lisa is the person to watch. We'll have to have you on again, because you have a
[00:47:06] virtual staging app as well that I certainly we didn't even get to, which is called restage.
[00:47:10] Check that out. It's available on on your app store. Re-staged. It's a virtual staging app.
[00:47:15] That's hers. Check it out. Lisa, thank you so much on behalf of the audience. We appreciate Lisa
[00:47:21] for spending an hour with us. And on behalf of Lisa and myself, I want to thank the audience for
[00:47:27] sticking around to the final for the final minute of the episode. And also please tell a friend.
[00:47:31] Think of one other REALTOR that could benefit from hearing this great conversation with Lisa.

[00:47:40] We will see you on the next episode. This is great. Thank you so much.

She's a podcast host. She's a top producer. She's a speaker. She's a total superstar in Hoboken as well as in Jersey City. She has two offices there. They service New Jersey. But let me tell you more about Lisa because she's really, really an amazing guest that we are able to have on the show. So Lisa describes herself as a serial entrepreneur. She is the sole owner, licensed partner and broker of record for Engle and Volker's Hoboken and Jersey City real estate brokerages as well as the My Homebooking real estate team leader.

My homeboken so it's like my Hoboken, but HOME instead, we'll have a link to that as well in the show notes. Also, subscribe to her podcast which is called Breakfast with Brokers, which she does weekly and she interviews agents and basically talks about the market. Lisa, welcome to the show. Hi, thanks for that intro. That was awesome. You do a lot of things. I do a lot of things. I'm very impressive. Lisa, yes, I can appreciate that. We have one brokerage here. You have two brokerages. I can't even imagine doing two. We have one with just under 800 agents and that is keeping us very busy. The idea of having two, just oh, that just makes my head spin, but not only doing that, you're also hosting a show, you also on apreneur or speaker, you do it all. Most importantly, you develop agents. I want to talk about this because one of the most important or impressive things I saw from you is that not only did you purchase Engel and Volkers and you open these two offices, but you also tripled the production of those offices. Let's be honest, that is not easy to do. Engel and Volkers is already an amazing brand. We have them here in Chicago, clearly a name that people respect and admire certainly one of the white club firms. But to triple the production of any office, regardless of the name that's on the signout front, is I mean, I would love to triple our agents production. Tell me what you're doing or what you did because I think our show is all about agent development. Tell us how you think, well, before we get to that, I'm so sorry. I go to go with my first question. We will get to agent development second. Sorry, tell us how you got in the industry. Yeah, so actually ties well into your second question. I was in online advertising sales in Manhattan working for several Fortune 500 companies and I worked for an incredible man who was, had an open door policy. So I literally sat next to the CEO of the company in this giant loft. There were no doors. It was just, he had this great open air policy basically come in, pitch me whatever idea you might have and I'll critique it. I'll give you my feedback. He was a serial entrepreneur and just off the charts, brilliant. And I had this idea for like an event planning company and I went to him and I remember sitting across the table from him and he's going through my business plan. I'm like, what did I just do? I just gave my boss my exit strategy. Like this is the dumbest idea I fell right into it and like he closes it up and he was like, what's the problem? It's great. And I was like, well, I have a job here and he's like, I'm laying off half the company tomorrow. You're never safe when you work for someone else. And I was like, that's true. What? And he flat out said, I love dishonesty. He flat out was like, you don't make enough money. I'm not laying you off. But half the company will not be here tomorrow. Yeah. Well, it's an important thing, by the way, to realize that if you, for people that do have corporate jobs or maybe you're thinking about getting into real estate, I was one of those people who was very highly compensated at a tech firm prior to this. I had just gotten a perfect review. I had gotten a raise and then I got laid off a week later. Even though all signs pointed to I am doing great. But because I was so highly compensated, I was very easily, they could get rid of me pretty easily. So that's a really strong point. Yeah. And I went on to go through like six or seven rounds of layoffs. And then finally, they closed my division of the company. And I was out on the street. They had no money left. They didn't give me any severance. And I remember being like, I'm going to just get my, at the time, my late mother was a REALTOR. I was like, I'm just going to get my real estate license. All of my friends were moving a hobo again. I'll do a couple rentals and it'll pad the bills. And I remember jumping into it with, I had the, the event planning company that I was starting. And it's kind of started doing time. And I had to make a decision worth my time. I have kids once I'd or a million dollar condos on the other. And I was like, I'm going out of the cocktails. So I closed my company and I star time as a mom and pop company eventually bought the remaining owner out. And here we are. So real estate. Yay. Unbelievable. It's amazing. It is, it's funny how people get into this business. And then some, you know, ultimately become, you know, broker owners. So let's talk a little bit about agent development as we were, as I was getting to at the beginning and realized I hadn't properly sort of gotten your story. So how do you think about training? And again, Engle and Vokers is, is really a brand, at least here in Chicago. And I'm guessing in most parts of the, of the country where it's, I don't know that there's a lot of brand new agents who join Engle and Vokers. I know it's a lot of like, hey, once you get to a certain level, you know, that's, that's a place. And again, maybe they do train new agents as well. But regardless, as a broker owner, you are always wanting your agents to do better production, more production. And of course, you're there to guide them. So how do you think about that? And, you know, tell us like kind of what you're talking to your agents about right now is 2024. Just started. We had a tough year last year, at least here in Chicago. I know we did probably you guys dealt with the same high interest rates in low inventory that everywhere else did. So how are you thinking about this year? I'm cautiously optimistic. If you asked me that question, I think three months ago, I would have told you bad and the hatches and grab your helmets. And that's it. But I have to tell you, I think, I mean, our market's a little resilient in that regard. Like we get the, we're five minutes outside of Manhattan. You can get into Manhattan from Hoboken in four different ways. Like train bus boat, you know, Uber, we're right across the river. So for us, we always bounce back a little bit quick and we're about nine months out of Manhattan's market. So, or nine month lag, I should say, for Manhattan's market. So we have a nice like people are always moving in and moving out, moving in, moving out. So there's always like a decent amount of transactions for us. That being said, when we closed last year, there were 53 properties on the market for 60,000 people. And there's a thousand and 11 REALTORS that identify as Hoboken as their market. So the math is just not mapping. So it's, it's one of those situations where I think we're going to continue to see low inventory, anything that comes on the mark, gobbled up with multiple offers over asking. And I think the low inventory is really what's keeping us going and keeping that that study. But a lot of parts, like we serve as a New Jersey, a little bit of West and we serve South Jersey as well. Not all those markets, but certain pockets of those markets. And you know, we're seeing it across the board. So I think as long as demand remains that high, we will continue to, to have, you know, a healthy situation. We just need, we need a little bit more inventory. And I don't, I'm sure you guys are seeing the same thing by us. The issue is, you know, we have everybody that is stuck in these two and two and a half percent interest rates. And during COVID, all of the pricing shot up, I mean, our single family market in Hoboken went up 24% in two years. So now, you know, that brownstone that was 1.8 is, you know, significantly higher. Now you can't get anything decent for under 25. And you know, again, the math isn't math thing. It's like people are like, well, I'm just going to stay in my condo until these rates come down. So it's, I think if we see, if we just see a five, if we just see five, nine, nine, nine, nine, nine, nine, nine, nine, like just a five, I think we would have like a wild spring. But I don't know. I mean, now they're talking about. No one has the crystal ball. It's funny. I hear everyone's got their own number with their cogs to rates. I hear 6.3. Obviously, 5.9 would be amazing. We don't know. I'm actually going to see Lawrence Yoon, who's the NAR chief chief economist. And next week, I'm just lucky enough that he's in Chicago because NAR is here. Despite all of their problems, we're still having this market out there. No, we won't go there. There was, I don't know if you saw there was news yesterday about, yeah, every way. I'm very curious to see what that's about. But that's just the gossipy part of me. But anyway, I will get to chance to to come back and do an episode on what Dr. Yoon predicts for this year. He's usually fairly accurate. But this is a big problem, right? I think it's 85% yeah, 85% of US homeowners with a mortgage have less than 5% rate. So as you're saying, I mean, I'm at 2.9% like I'm not moving. Yeah, yeah. So, so it's a problem. But is there does the math work? And this is, I guess, the question in its market specific, but I'm curious, does the math sort of work when rates are where they're at now, just be oh, you're dealing with catalog of cash offers, I bet. So that made that may sort of negate what I'm about to say. But for non cash offers, I think now might actually be a decent time to buy because it rates do drop to the low sixes. It's going to be, it's going to be so much competition. I just wonder if people are going to be grow up vastly overpaying if they were to buy today. I mean, they're already on like three group chats with friends and family, like talking about my in-laws have a house that went up across the street from them. They live in a modest block back up to a commercial district like not cold to sack, like not like, you know, everyone's like and the house just hit for two eight and it's like, what's like it's I think everyone's already overpaying. I think everyone's really overpaying. But I also think that like to your point right now is a great time to buy because you have a little bit of leverage and you know, whatever's still sitting on the market right now might not necessarily be bad. It just might be, you know, it was mispriced or you know, it's not the typical, you know, all white modern farmhouse everyone wants. Like it just might be a little different that you could change. I think to your point, it's a great time to buy. I also want to talk a little bit about brokerages. So this is something we don't ever talk about on the show and being somebody who's in management at a brokerage, I think there's a lot of times a disconnect between what agents maybe expect from a brokerage and also just how brokerages work. I think I think one myth that I'd like as a broker owner, you can I probably appreciate dispelling is that the margins for brokerages are high. They're really not and you know, brokerages are in competition with other brokerages of course for commissions and everything. So, you know, we're at a situation where I think agents continue to like clients squeeze the agents, the agents squeeze the brokerages. You know, things are changing a bit. Do you do you think there's going and of course the lawsuits with respect to commissions? Do we do you think there's going to be like a massive change in the next several years with how agents are compensated? Obviously, it's a crystal ball question, but just curious about, you know, how it's all going to is. Are things going to fundamentally change? Do you think? I mean, I think yes, I think, I think, frankly, we're the last agency, the last industry that hasn't been shook up, right? We're the last ones that, you know, taxis had Uber and blockbuster had Netflix. You know, we're the last ones that really haven't had a major shake up. So, I think, I think, yeah, I think something's coming, what that is, to be honest, I have no idea. You're absolutely right. The margins, the margins are very thin for brokerages. I mean, I only have 33 agents across two brokerages and that's kind of by design. Sure. But to your point, more agents is more money, right? So, it's like, I think we, the power of the brokerage was diminished with certain models that emerged, not naming names, but the capping model. I think a lot of things were dangled in front of agents' faces. You should come here. You could make 95% of your commission. It's like, right, but now you have a bunch of people running around the industry that don't know what they're doing and have absolutely no one to call. I mean, there's a brokerage, and again, I would never call anyone out, but there's a brokerage where it took me two months to find the broker, two months, I'm where to send the check. Like, I mean, really? So, I think, to a point, and this is a good segue into your other questions, I think everything's going to go back to some level of basics. And you hear Tom Ferry talk about it, you hear Bafini talk about it, but there's going to be some level of back to basics. And I think what what we offer and what I'm sure you do as well is, you know, you need some sort of guidance. You need somebody I came up with a mentor perspective where I could call that person at 9 p.m. or I can call him at mid-died or I can call him a one in the afternoon and he picked up. And that's 100% why it became a successful agent quickly because I had answers to questions. Yeah, I can't think of anything more important for an agent who's newer or just looking to increase production is having somebody who's either doing slightly better than they are or who's just an industry veteran who can say like, here's how to do it, call me when you need help. And brokerages, I think, are a lot of them are starting to move more towards the team model, which teams a lot of times can pick up the slack of where a brokerage may be smaller, maybe doesn't have as much support or training. I'm seeing that a lot happen here in our in our market here a lot of, we're seeing a lot of brokerages step away from training and kind of put that on the laps of the team leaders. So that's kind of interesting. But again, there's quality control issues with that, I'm sure, depends on the team, of course. But the idea of just having a mentor is so critical. We are actually finally putting a true mentorship program together this year in our brokerage. It's taken us a long time and it's really tricky as you know mentorship programs are tricky because you know, you don't want to give your agent that just joined you a bad experience. At the same time, you're putting a lot of trust into the whoever the mentor is. And at the same time, you have to figure out how you're constantly communicating with both to make sure that everybody's happy and getting what they need. And of course, you know, that, but that's what a brokerage should be doing. That's literally part of the job if that's something they offer. Or if they don't offer that, you know, they should have, hey, if you call between this time and this time, you're going to get one of us on the phone, we're here to help you. We, you know, we, we are, we're here to help. But not every brokerage is like that. I, I will say this to anyone listening. If you are somebody who is calling and you don't get good responses, this is the year to maybe explore other options. See what other firms offer because mentorship support training, these are the things that you are paying for for your brokerage. Please, please, please take advantage of them. Yes, if you're going to a firm that doesn't have these things, but they offer you like the highest commissions, okay, fine, you get that that's a trade off. But really understand that there are other solutions out there. And maybe it makes sense to earn less commission if you're getting better, of course, better training and support. What are you encouraging your, what about fundamentals? What are you encouraging your agents to do this year, just to sort of stay busy, you know, we can't control the interest rates or the market inventory, but we can control our, our actions. So just curious on what you're seeing successful agents do right now. Yeah, I mean, I think we're, we're actually approaching it from like a three-prong approach. So basically, we're, we're looking at the people that actually have to move. So I'm encouraging them to develop relationships with, you know, attorneys that might handle trust in the state work, attorneys that might handle, you know, divorce, you know, really get in touch with old, like retirement communities and let, you know, if you have somebody moving in, they most likely have to sell something. I mean, really acting as an advisor for these people that are going through a very scary transition in their life. Like, I think this country doesn't do a good job of kind of protecting our elderly people. And it's a scary time for them, right? And they're saying, I just saw another professor, I don't remember the name, but it was like, they're calling the silver tsunami. And it's like most of the transactions that will happen in the next five years are people over 65 caching out. And I think the best thing you can do or any agent can do is really start to make relationships in that realm. That's certainly something I never knew anything about. And now I have wonderful relationships with divorce attorneys and trust in the state's attorneys. And, you know, that sort of thing. I think that's going to be key going forward because they so many of those baby boomers are caching out in the next couple of years. Oh, yeah. Great, great, great pointly says. So everyone listening, if you do not have relationships with divorce attorneys, estate planning attorneys, accountants, financial advisors, these are all people that deal with a lot of times as someone's entire net worth. And so they know they understand the situation. Somebody is having a life event change or inheriting a bunch of money, maybe from a parent who is, you know, passed away, baby boomers, baby boomers are going to be transferring a trot on trillions of dollars down to over the next handful of years to their siblings or sorry, their offspring. And this is the time to build those relationships so that when it maybe even becomes a tax advantage reason why somebody buys or sells or puts something in a trust that you're their person. So now's the time to start reaching out to those providers and start saying, I want to build a relationship with you. I want to learn, you know, how can I send you business? And, you know, here's what I look for. And you can also to be like to be I'm sorry to interrupt you to be ethical about it, you know, it's a scary time. I think there, you know, that generation is very, runs out to get their money, you know, so it's one of those things to like to really approach it from like a place of assistance and a place of helping and be like, we're going to make sure that everything's safe and your kids get everything and you're happy. And, you know, just being an ally in that process that is, and to me sounds terrifying, you know, I think that's going to go a long way and it's actually doing something nice with what we're doing, you know, so it's I think it's a great, great option. It's an amazing option. I'm so glad you you mentioned that because we are fiduciaries. So we are responsible for making sure we're doing what's in our client's best financial interest. And as Lisa just said, it's really the right thing to do. So I would say in every conversation with every client conversation at some point, say, hey, by the way, do you have somebody managing your estate? Do you have a will? Do you have some of this setup? It not that you have to get involved as the agent, but you just want to say, I just want to make sure everything's protected and that we're doing things in the right way. Even if it's just to show that you care that even just saying that demonstrates, I care about your situation. And I know people that can help with this. If you need that, you have a good account, and you have a good financial advisor. Do you have enough insurance? Are you covered in everything? Even though yes, we're selling homes, we want to make sure that this home fits into your financial plan. I bet if an agent would say that to a potential client and maybe they're interviewing three or four other real tours as well, I bet those other agents probably wouldn't bring up those kind of things because it gets tricky where you don't have to answer those questions when they're like, well, what about this? They say, hey, that's not my area of expertise, but I have people that can help that can help you with that. Or let's just get everyone on the same page. Yeah, totally. From a marketing perspective, because that's your background, I want to talk about what marketing strategies do you see working like right now? What do you see agents doing that's successful? Maybe what do we see agents doing that you sort of shake your head and go, you know, not a good idea? Yeah, I think, you know, this whole concept of agents having to be their own social media marketers, I think some are born for this. I think some need to hire someone. I think it's along the, you know, I think you have to find a place and this is one thing that we do offer is like that you can stand out, right? And I think a lot of agents, there's a lot of ego involved in this business. I mean, I'm sure you've seen it and you know, and there's part of that that's actually really great because it allows these agents to kind of, you know, create this persona and they create this whole business surrounding that ego and it's wonderful. It can also go in a very bad direction. So I think it's, I think it's one of those things where find, find a way that you can create a platform for yourself where you stand out because like I said earlier, we have a thousand eleven REALTORS that identify with Hoboken as a pro, that's insane. We're one square mile. So you really need, I think 70, 78 of us do the most work. You need a way to stand out. I mean, social media is still free, which is crazy to me. Like that, I mean, the fact that people aren't diving into that, diving into AI in certain ways. Like there's so, that's the fun part of this, I think. Like come up with creative videos, come up with creative videos for yourself, not just for properties, you know, market yourself through video. If you're sending, don't just send emails, what's an open rate for an email now? It's like nothing, you know, if you send it with a video on it that's somewhat interesting or directed to that person. So we're doing a lot of that. We're doing very targeted marketing. We also utilize our network. So Angle and Vokers is in 33 countries around the world. And we actually work very well together. You mentioned the one in Chicago. I think we just sent him something a couple weeks ago. Like we worked very well on the referral side of things and we double down on that because we do have a great relationship with the shop. So I think, you know, kind of find your niche and then get it out into the world. I also think, and this is a buzzword. So I hate to, I can watch my agent, Tom Worley rolling his eyes right now if he's ever listening to this is the term authentic. I think we were being authentic before authentic was cool. And I think that's key. Like you're, this is, you know, we did this all the time, we're doing multiple transactions a month, all that stuff. But we forget that a lot of times this, this is like the most important transaction for someone. So now they are renting a Bentley and driving around the street like acting like you, you know, that does nothing for anybody. You know, it's, it's you want to authentically present a home authentically present yourself and kind of cut away with all that craziness. Like I think that's a big trend that's going to go, Hey, why are you the days of, you know, rolling up to the estate in the Maclaren, I think you're done. I think it's, you got to do something a little bit more authentic. I think you're right. And good riddance to those days, in my opinion, because, because, well, and there's nothing, you know, again, everyone's different and cheers to the people that do that. And I'm not here to disparage them. But, but I think authenticity, the way I think about it is skills. Are, well, honesty and skill. So it's like, are you actually telling the truth? Are you presenting your actual self? And are you good? Are you actually useful to the agent? And the useful agents always do business. It's, it's funny. It's, and you guess you have to have a good marketing plan and you have to, there's more to it than just being good. But being good is really the, the most important thing. And it's, this is the year to sharpen skills because, as I'm sure you're seeing this in your market, you know, yeah, there's a thousand agents who identify, you know, as Hoboken, but I'll bet you by the end of this year, there won't be a thousand agents. I'll bet you there'll be a lot fewer. And the agents that are, are still around and doing all of those things to sharpen their skills and keep their marketing strong are going to gobble up market share. I mean, I certainly hope that's what happens because we certainly could use in this industry, you know, some agents probably do need to leave the industry, but not of your own fault. Maybe they were never trained well. Maybe they don't, it's just not really their job. But we're going to see, I mean, we're already seeing it. We have a holding company for agents that don't actively practice. We started it like 10 years ago, just like, as a kind of a goof like, well, I guess we should have a hold of company started with one agent. Now we have a thousand agents in there. In the last, in the last year, we've seen 200 people join our holding company, not like from our firm, over to our holding just in the whole state of Illinois. So we're seeing huge people leaving, which should be very actually both scary and very exciting to anyone listening to this because exciting because you're going to have more opportunity, scary because it could happen to you too. So I think it's important that if you just keep doing the right things and learning, I don't see any reason why somebody wouldn't be successful. But I like it. So we talked about social media. Yes, of course, videos, but you know, and right now, I think we think about how do I be useful on social media? There's all sorts of ways to do that. You know, pick a micro market, a some sort of geographic area and do videos about that area and highlight the restaurants. And the, I mean, you could do all sorts of fun things that are really useful to the community. And then you could then go into those like restaurants and say, Hey, I just made a video about you guys here. I just want to let you know I'm going to tag you. You guys, if you want to send it out, that'd be great too. And there's all sorts of ways to get immersed in the community. But I think that's that's going to be the key is getting back to those basics of getting involved in the community, learning your skills. But but I am curious, you know, what what, you know, are you seeing anything else like our, are you seeing traditional mailers, for example, I'm hearing of agents going back to doing a lot of physical mailers. To me, the mailer thing, I've never, I've never got it. I'll never be a proponent of it. I know they're success with it. I know you have to do it like 45 times upside down, hanging from a lock of hair. I don't know. Everybody talks about it. Like it's the gods gift to our business. I don't get it. I have agents that do it. And I support that. I love it. To me, it's so much money. It's just it's just litter. And I'm not, you know, I'm not saying like from a environmental perspective, it's just, I mean, I personally get like six a week. And so it's, and I'm an agent. So it's like, to me, I don't know, I don't get the mailer thing. I get that it works. And if that's your, if you swear by it, by all means, die on that hill. But for me, I don't get the mailer thing personally. I think your way better utilizing video in unique ways. I, I, I sent out a text yesterday. I went through all of my old landlords and gave them a video just saying, Hey, you may have made a lot of money. Like let me, you know, let me know if, if you have any interest in selling because this is the difference of what you could make. And here's a net proceeds worksheet. And blah, blah, blah. I have like six meetings next week, just from doing that. And it's, I don't have a ton of landlords. You know, I have maybe like 20, 20 to 30 landlords. And I have six meetings. I mean, that's a huge return. So I feel like huge. That sort of thing. I think we need to get creative. And I think we're going to need to learn how to serve in videos. I think video and social or anything you can do from text messaging is, is fantastic. Yeah. And I love that with text messaging with systems like bomb bomb or loom, where what's really cool. If, if anyone listening hasn't explored those, what's really neat is if you know somebody with one of those accounts, have them send you one just as a test because what's cool is they'll take a video. And this really, you can send it if you're like iPhone to iPhone or I don't know what it looks like for Android. But what's cool is it will literally take the video that you make and create like a little Jeff three second Jeff. And then it'll send it to the person. And then you know, it'll, they'll see that they have a video for them right in their text message. And they're more likely to click on it. We sent an email. We sent an email to all 700 plus of our agents announcing we have a new managing broker, which is a very big deal for us. And so we sent out an email on Sunday, which is not the best data, you know, send out an email. But to all of our agents, they say, Hey, just FY this big long thing. Here's our new managing broker, welcome, etc. And then we sent an SMS on Monday to just with a video. And we were curious to what got the higher open right. We knew text messages were would, but it was night and day difference. We had almost a 50% almost 50% of our agents clicked on the link in the text message about 15% of our agents clicked on the link in the email or open the email, even open the email. And maybe that says more about how we communicate via email than anything. But it's just the way it is. I mean, people are, well, you know, this nobody reads the email. You're a broker owner. You know how it goes. So this idea of utilizing SMS in a way that's not invasive, that's not overly communicative, but like providing value is amazing. It's such a great creative way. And people don't probably want to take your phone calls all the time either, right? So that's a great way to sort of have a conversation without having a conversation is you're like, Hey, I just, you know, here's a, you know, let's take a look at your property and see if it's a good time to sell. Yep. 100%. I mean, even if you like from a brokerage perspective, even recruiting, I mean, I have a great relationship with some of my best agents and they show me the text messages they get these campaigns that these, it is wild. I mean, you'll have like, Hey, want to work here? And they're like, no thanks. And they're like, Hey, but you really should work here. And they're like, no thanks. And he's like, please work here. It's like, Oh my god. And it's like relentless. I mean, to the point where I think it almost turns them off. Like totally, you know, it's, I don't know, I think there's an art to it. And I think that's, that's really going to separate like who makes it through this next transition is who can figure out what that art is and how you can do it authentically to yourself and, and really utilize these because there are so many tools that I mean, I don't even know if you dove into AI at all, but like I try and do like a little each week because it is the stuff you can do with that is incredible. I mean, you know, the most obvious application or the first one I had heard of was drop in your listing description and it'll rewrite it. And you know, you'd tell it to rewrite it in a particular way. You can also tell it to abide by, you know, whatever rules are applicable in your particular state or federal rules around making sure it's not a housing violation. But, but yes, you can do that. That's sort of, I think most people know about that stuff now. But what if you were like, I don't have anything to do for the next two days because I don't have any client appointments, you could literally ask Chad GBT, hey, I'm a REALTOR. I have the next two days free and I my goal is this. I want to, you know, reach out to Ted new people or whatever. And please give me ideas about how to do that. It will literally give you ideas. So you don't even have to come up with your own ideas anymore, which I think is so cool. And, and yeah, so utilize AI. I think of it as like, I don't remember if it's the Odyssey or whatever. There was a, the Oracle at Delphi, I think it may be for the Odyssey. Anyway, anyway, whatever. It's an old Greek mythology thing. But the Oracle Delphi was this thing, you know, you could ask anything for it. It would tell you the answer. I feel like Chad GBT is our version of that. It's not perfect. But it can do a lot of cool things. So you start talking to it. Yeah. And start asking questions and asking for help like, hey, help me market this property. What? Oh, there's something really cool you could do that I'll mention real quick. I just learned about this. You can put it, I did this for myself because I wanted to see the building I live in is only three years old. It's a brand new development or new wish. And so I said, I wonder what Chad GBT, which I don't even use the paid version. I have like the free version, which only goes back to like 2020 or something. So it scours the web, but it only scours it, I think, through like 2020. I don't think there's anything more current than that in, in its database, although I may be wrong. Anyway, I said, I wonder what Chad GBT knows about my condo unit or my building. And I said, Hey, I live at this address, tell me everything you know about it, which I was just interested to see it knew what kind of countertops I had. It knew the pricing. Oh, it was wild. Because what it did, it had probably scraped the website that was for my building when when building was selling units or I don't know where grab the data from it didn't say, or maybe it did, but I didn't look. But regardless, it knew everything. And I thought, if I was an agent practicing, I would put this in before every listing. Because maybe there'll be some fun little facts and things to know about the property that you would never know, or maybe even a listing agent doesn't know. And, you know, you'll just learn it knew when it was built, it knew, it just knew everything. It knew what the average price points were. I was so cool. So, you know, if you should do that before every listing, just to find, or if there's nothing that if it doesn't know anything about the property, I would say, well, tell me some cool things about the neighborhood that maybe a perspective buyer would want to know. Like, where's the cool restaurants, whatever, it could be anything. So, yeah, AI, absolutely. It's very cool. It's very scary, but it's very cool. What do you think there's going, what do we think about commissions? Now, I know New York, New Jersey, you know, you're you guys have a very unique market there. But do we think agent commissions are going to change? Do we think, do you are you seeing a trend where listing commissions are coming down, going up, staying the same, just curious? I mean, we what I'm seeing or what I ended up finding out, we started to see where that buyer's agents were only getting 2%. So, usually in our market, it's a five or six percent listing and we usually split it in half to 1,2 and a half to the listing agent, 2 and a half to property brokers. When I started to see was more and more 2% listings and it coincided around the time that all these lawsuits happen, which don't even get me started on those. But that so when all that so I was like, oh, maybe it's a reflection of that. Maybe point people aren't willing to give it out. When you actually looked at the hudds and the closing disclosures, you were seeing that the listing agent was keeping 3 and only giving out to. So, I think there's going to be a little bit, I think listing agents are probably going to have a little bit more control over where that distribution lies. And we started doing it here for some properties because to be honest, there was so much like tumultuous like fighting over deals. I don't it was a post-COVID thing. I don't know if everybody was just inside for too long. I don't know what happened. But like, it was like two months ago, I spent the entire day arguing over a refrigerator. This guy just took his sub-zero refrigerator and just rolled it out the door. It's not like on a refrigerator. It's a $10,000 item. Like we have a problem here. It's like, sue me. It's so like contentious. So, I think that if you and the listing agent have that shined, okay, well, here I'm going to give in like 2,000 of my allows you to kind of control the deal a little bit more and keep things going. I mean, I think the other thing is too, listing agents, it's not a slam dunk now, to sell or it won't be. So, I think we're going to have to do way more marketing. I think we're going to have to do way more higher end videos and higher end promotion. And so, that is costly. So, I could see that being more of a shift that I'm not necessarily worried about, but vigilant of. Whether or not there's not going to be buyer's agency, I don't know. I mean, I think it's really doing the whole industry into service and the seller into service to just eliminate buyer's agency being paid. I think people think that REALTORS get paid too much, but if they actually saw what was going on in the back end, they would be appalled. I had multiple people this year. Be like, I don't know why you do this. It's like, what? And they couldn't, you know, my clients know how hard I work and they're happy to pay the fees. I haven't honestly had pushed back on fees in years. But who knows? You know, the more that these crazy lawsuits get published, it's a sad state of affairs. I think they, you know, people, well, I'll leave it at that. I think it's it's more along the lines of like a mental situation, a mental health situation than it is anything else. But yeah, I agree. I think people that have really worked with a good REALTOR really know how much work is done and how much we do to keep the deal together. So I think at the end, I think that'll prevail. I do think we're going to go through a weird time of justifying our fees, but I think at the end, we'll be fine. I think so too. And I think this is where skill just kind of wins the game. If you're worried about, if you're, if you're getting pushback on your commissions, to me, I would see that as an agent. I would see that as feedback that maybe I'm not communicating my value proposition as well as I could be. And really saying, here's why, in fact, if I was an agent, I would just say, I would explain to you how I get paid. I would explain to you exactly how it works. And I want to explain why it's where, why I believe it's worth it. And, you know, I mean, you don't have to have that conversation every time. But for anyone that's on the fence, I mean, this is kind of the lawsuits were kind of about this where, you know, commissions were kind of nebulous and kind of confusing. And nobody really understood them, except the agents, because it wasn't super obvious who was paying the commissions and how it all works. But this is a great opportunity to get ahead of it and really just explain it to buyers, say, okay, technically, you're not paying a commission, except you are paying a commission. And let me explain how it's all baked into the price and everything. So you get a better sense of where it comes from and how it all works out. I think, you know, just agents explaining things better is always a win. And I think, at that, to your point, I think they're not, you're not going to get as much pushback. I think when it's more confusing, I think that's people are like, wait a minute, what am I paying? Like, it's like when I go into buy a car, which I like never do, because it's such a bad experience buying a car. At least I feel. Yeah, you always feel like you're getting ripped off. Like nobody ever is like, here's, okay, here's what I'm going to make if I sell you this car. Like, I'm happy to say if somebody's like, hey, I make 400 bucks each time I sell a car, I need to up this by 400 bucks so I can make it. Like I get it. Like we can have that conversation. I'm not I'm not a monster. But if I feel like you're ripping me off, now I'm not, now I don't trust you. Or if I feel like I don't know the real story, now I'm like, well, now I don't know who to believe. So I think with REALTORS, we don't think fully we are not, we are not cars. There's nothing wrong with car salesmen. I love, I love good car salesmen. But we know that the stigma in the industry is, I don't, I think I'm getting ripped off. I don't know. So we don't want that, you know, that same stigma here. And I think a lot of it's just explain, explain, explain, explain, explain tell everybody how it works. There's no secrets anyway. I mean, it's not anything to be at the nearest about. Who isn't looking at the HUD and notice it like, obviously we're a massive line item. But it's also like, like what I started to do now is literally lay out before I start working with someone, exactly what's going to happen the entire transaction and exactly what we're going to do for you on each side. And I, like I said, I've never had anyone push back ever. I should say ever the past like three or four years when it's really been a question, you know, but to your point, yeah, transparency. I agree. We should also mention I didn't do a great job of this on this episode, but I do want to mention that Lisa, you know, she, look, she owns two white glove brokerages in Jersey City and Hoboken angle invulkers. If you don't know them, they're amazing. They're really, really at the top of the, at the top of the mountain for, for these, you know, high, they attract very high producers. They also develop people into high producers. It's just a good company. So if you are in those areas and you're an agent, now again, company like ours, we hire tons and tons of people, but Lisa's a little bit more, she's, she's, she and her team are very careful about who they bring on board because they want, they want to develop you or they want to bring you on and find a solution for maybe an issue you're having at your current brokerage. So if you're like, I would like to work at a place like that where by the way, when Lisa came on board, she tripled production. That would be pretty cool if you're an agent. So how about checking out what Lisa has to offer? So Lisa, if there is an agent out there that's interested and by the way, guys, I want to also talk about if you're a New York agent, or just a second, but if somebody's thinking about maybe making a switch, Lisa, what's the best way they should reach out to learn about your brokerage? Yeah, I mean, you could reach out to me personally. It's info at myhomeboken.com. You could text me, 2012132617 or you could actually, I'm on social constantly. Obviously, like I said earlier, it's a big focus for us. So you could DM me at at my homeboken. So m y h o m e b o k e n dot com. And then our, if, go ahead, sorry, our brokerage account is at e v hoboken jc. So you could do that one too. But either way, we'll have links to all that in the show notes. Thank you for that. And also want to mention too that for agents that are in other parts of the country that have clients that maybe move to New York, I mean, Hoboken and Jersey City are really considered New York at this point. It's becomes, you know, a very desirable area, regardless of what somebody's price points may be, those are included in the sort of Manhattan sort of market. So if you have it clients that are moving into New York, reach out to Lisa because her team focuses on the Jersey side. Do you guys do New York as well? Or just the Jersey side? We have a great relationship with our New York office. So we actually have, we can, and our Brooklyn offices. So we actually, we can help you, you know, if we could actually do look at 360 approach, we can give you some options in New Jersey that we think are comparable to New York. And then, you know, we can send you to New York agents and they can handle it as well. So yeah, by all means, if I'm the starting point, that would be great. So it can. And if you're, if you're somebody where people from those areas move to retire to probably going somewhere further south and warmer, if you are in one of those markets where fed from those areas, another good person to reach out to to say, Hey, I bet you have people that are moving. Let's figure out a way to mutually benefit each other. So reach out to Lisa and overseas. I put nine families overseas last year. Nine. We have an overseas component. Like we always do a decent amount overseas. Nine is insane. That's incredible. So reach out to Lisa. Also, I want you to subscribe to her podcast, which is breakfast with brokers. You can find it anywhere podcasts are served and follow her on Instagram on all the social platforms. My home, Boken will have the link to that in the show notes. Lisa, thank you so much for being on our show. We greatly appreciate your time. You're amazing. Total superstar Lisa is the person to watch. We'll have to have you on again, because you have a virtual staging app as well that I certainly we didn't even get to, which is called restage. Check that out. It's available on on your app store. Re-staged. It's a virtual staging app. That's hers. Check it out. Lisa, thank you so much on behalf of the audience. We appreciate Lisa for spending an hour with us. And on behalf of Lisa and myself, I want to thank the audience for sticking around to the final for the final minute of the episode. And also please tell a friend. Think of one other REALTOR that could benefit from hearing this great conversation with Lisa. Send them a link to the show. We can invite us everywhere. So Lisa, thank you so much. We will see you on the next episode. This is great. Thank you so much.
