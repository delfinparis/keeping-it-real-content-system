[00:02:38] Thanks DJ, thanks for having me.
[00:02:39] Appreciate it.
[00:02:40] It's good to be back.
[00:02:41] It's been a little bit since I've seen it.
[00:02:43] Been with you.
[00:02:44] It's been a while and we have, I have some congratulations in order that you have now joined
[00:02:50] forces with Colble Banker.
[00:02:53] We have, yes, yeah.
[00:02:54] So I've been working on that with them for the past few months and it's been exciting.
[00:02:58] It's a great, great group of people over there and very excited about that.
[00:03:04] And we get to take two wonderful cultures and meldingly gather and work with an organization
[00:03:11] that has basically a wonderful global presence.
[00:03:14] A lot of value added to our agents.
[00:03:16] I'm incredibly excited.
[00:03:17] My wife's an agent at the company.
[00:03:18] So I just excited from all the things that I saw that they have access to makes me very
[00:03:24] excited.
[00:03:25] And then I get to, I get to coach and I get to even coach even more people, which makes
[00:03:29] me, makes me excited about the whole opportunity as well.
[00:03:33] And it's also, I want this to be inspiring to for anyone who's in the process of building
[00:03:38] a team or thinking of starting a brokerage.
[00:03:41] If you don't mind Ryan, just sharing just maybe a minute or so, a minute or two of the
[00:03:45] journey from being your own managing broker, starting a firm and now all these years later
[00:03:52] integrating it with Colble Banker.
[00:03:54] Yeah, you know, it's, it is, it's quite a journey.
[00:03:56] It starts off with anything that you do.
[00:03:58] It's, you know, it's something that you're very passionate about.
[00:04:00] And I started the real estate company because I was very passionate about coaching agents
[00:04:05] and helping them develop.
[00:04:06] And we built our company off of that about probably, you know, you know, our company did
[00:04:12] in 21.
[00:04:14] We did about $1.2 billion.
[00:04:16] You know, yeah, 21.
[00:04:17] We did about 1.2 billion in sales in 2022, which is a down year for everybody.
[00:04:22] We did over a billion dollars, but we were down.
[00:04:25] But it's something to be really proud of the hangar hat on and probably 85% of our agents
[00:04:30] started their career at our company and probably allow them.
[00:04:33] It was only seven or eight years ago and we were putting up some pretty, pretty big
[00:04:37] numbers, which we were really proud of.
[00:04:40] And you know, that is based on something I was very passionate about.
[00:04:43] I was working individually with the agents.
[00:04:45] I, this past Saturday, you know, the company sold and this past Saturday, I was at one
[00:04:50] of our offices with a bunch of agents and I was doing a group coaching session and it's
[00:04:54] allowed me to get back to what I was passionate, really passionate about.
[00:04:58] The company grew, it grew quite large and I started to find that my desire, my past
[00:05:03] passion of coaching and training was being overshadowed by a lot of administrative stuff.
[00:05:08] As you know, running a real estate company, there is more to it than meets the eye, I guess.
[00:05:14] Let's just put it that way.
[00:05:16] It's a lot of work.
[00:05:17] So by joining forces with Colt Little Banker, it allowed me to get what I would get to
[00:05:24] what I'm more passionate about, which is working with each individual agent.
[00:05:26] Also, blown off serves, I coach blown officers, I coach title sales reps, I coach insurance,
[00:05:33] agents, anybody who's in sales, I coach them, I help them, you know, set a goal and then
[00:05:39] create a path to where they want to get to.
[00:05:43] Yeah, it's amazing and I just, I know you're a very humble person but I do want to stress
[00:05:49] that you built a company, an independent brokerage here in Chicago, you competed with the biggest
[00:05:56] and the best and you built a business that really was, you know, is as big and as powerful
[00:06:06] and as impressive as the big franchise firms and that in and of itself is a very difficult
[00:06:14] thing to do.
[00:06:15] And so I just want to honor you for building up a company, a healthy company, a healthy
[00:06:26] wonderful position and what a wonderful testament to how you built your business so that all
[00:06:32] these other brokerages wanted to join forces with you.
[00:06:36] So, glad you landed with Colt Little Banker, our company, our managing broker started at
[00:06:41] Colt Little Banker, we're big fans, of course of them as well.
[00:06:44] So congratulations to all the agents at Deapral and you've got a great journey ahead of you
[00:06:51] and really exciting.
[00:06:52] Thanks, thanks, yeah, I am excited.
[00:06:54] And, you know, yeah, it is one of the things we reflect back, I was telling my wife, you
[00:06:59] know, I never really paused because I was running so hard these past 11 years growing
[00:07:03] the organization and it was, you know, after the sale, I looked back and said to myself,
[00:07:09] Jesus Christ, I am probably one of the most competitive real estate markets in the country.
[00:07:14] Yeah.
[00:07:15] Which, cargo is brutal.
[00:07:18] Brutal.
[00:07:19] It's very competitive and so I did have a moment of pride where I've always kind of
[00:07:24] never really taken the time to do that and I did and thank you, I appreciate you saying
[00:07:29] that.
[00:07:30] Yeah, it's a big deal and very few independent firms have done it.
[00:07:36] So that is a real feather in your cap and obviously again, really highlights your ability
[00:07:43] to grow a business and keep your agents happy and keep them productive and keep them,
[00:07:49] probably keep the business profitable.
[00:07:50] So speaking of all of that, it is 2023.
[00:07:54] It's our first coaching moments of the year and everybody I know whether they're a broker
[00:07:59] owner or a team leader or just an individual producing agent, everybody I know seems to
[00:08:06] be a little scared, nervous, worried about what's going on, what's right in front of them,
[00:08:14] what they should be focused on so they don't get caught up in, you know, in action or,
[00:08:20] you know, just the business cycle is being changed, changing it currently.
[00:08:26] So I would love to know as a coach what you are saying, what are you hearing out there
[00:08:32] and what you're recommending to agents who are a little nervous or scared about where
[00:08:37] we are right now in the housing.
[00:08:39] Sure.
[00:08:39] Yeah, absolutely.
[00:08:40] Well, so the first thing to keep in mind, there's a tremendous amount of distractions.
[00:08:43] Look, we just saw the company and I think every single recruiter in Chicago land area
[00:08:49] is my agents numbers on speed dial and they're calling it over and over and over.
[00:08:54] It is a recruiting for people like me and by the way, I've not been doing that to your
[00:09:00] agents, but because we don't really compete in that same way, but I recruiters are having
[00:09:06] a field day right now.
[00:09:07] Now is the time when agents are struggling so the recruiters come out and they promise
[00:09:12] the world and every agent, every one of our listeners is probably getting prospected
[00:09:16] by somebody in their local markets.
[00:09:18] You know, and for the people who are listening to that are real estate agents that are not
[00:09:22] on the corporate side or the relocation or the corporate side or the recruiting side,
[00:09:27] you know, you got to listen to the message.
[00:09:28] The message is overwhelmingly becoming to my agents has been messages of fear.
[00:09:35] And majority of people will be able to be scared.
[00:09:39] And it's a shame.
[00:09:40] You should be inspiring, leading by inspiration.
[00:09:44] You should be, you know, you should lead by hope.
[00:09:48] You should not be, you know, leading by fear, which is basically manipulating somebody
[00:09:53] to get what you want by scaring them.
[00:09:55] And there's a lot of scary things that are out there and kind of really be smart and
[00:10:00] who you align yourself with.
[00:10:04] And you know, when times are rough, I mean, again, I've been through this in the great
[00:10:08] recession and here we are in another difficult market.
[00:10:12] You know, when times are rough, everybody is going to look outside of themselves first
[00:10:18] and make the change.
[00:10:20] Look a year ago, you know, a year ago before I was even thinking about selling anything
[00:10:26] on the start came a number of agents left my company.
[00:10:29] They leave every year.
[00:10:30] They were all top producing agents.
[00:10:33] And unfortunately, all but one shit the bet.
[00:10:36] And the reason being, I think is that we had such a strong culture of accountability
[00:10:41] and whatnot and some of the excuses when I just say, like, well, look at these tools
[00:10:45] and these technology and this and that.
[00:10:47] There's tools, technology and gizmos.
[00:10:49] They're going to calm and they're going to go.
[00:10:50] There is nothing that is earth shattering about what we do.
[00:10:55] Anybody could say tech and tools and technology.
[00:10:59] The truth is, I even going to open up the computer six weeks later and use the technology
[00:11:04] that they gave you and really what difference is it.
[00:11:08] And so what everybody does when they're trying to improve, right?
[00:11:13] They change everything outside first.
[00:11:18] That's why 93% of them don't improve.
[00:11:21] The work comes from within.
[00:11:24] If you want different results, you need to change.
[00:11:27] That doesn't mean you need to change companies.
[00:11:30] And I'm not talking about my company.
[00:11:31] I'm talking about any industry, whatever.
[00:11:33] It means you personally have got to change.
[00:11:36] You know, it lies within what are you doing?
[00:11:39] What are your activities?
[00:11:40] I'm Saturday when I was with the group of agents and I was coaching them.
[00:11:44] One of them said, look, you know, I'm doing this and I'm doing this and I,
[00:11:47] and I, and I time block, excuse me, I set up my all my social media posts
[00:11:52] for months in advance.
[00:11:55] And she looked at me and like, and she's like, well, I go ahead and I pre-plan this stuff.
[00:12:00] I'm like, and she's like, well, what do you mean?
[00:12:02] And I'm like, well, that's not what moves the needle in your business.
[00:12:06] I mean, that's not, I mean, social media marketing, okay, is seen by majority
[00:12:12] of the people that have already liked your post.
[00:12:14] Probably 94% of them are your fellow real estate agents that are saying, go ahead,
[00:12:18] friend, good for you and they're liking your stuff.
[00:12:20] It's going to the same people over and over again.
[00:12:23] If you're doing social media, if you're using social media by marketing versus researching
[00:12:29] and developing, right, then you're going about this business, relationship building,
[00:12:34] business the wrong way.
[00:12:36] And when you point to some of the top, top people out there, right, that have beautiful social
[00:12:41] media marketing out there, but they're also selling 30, 40, 50, $100 million real estate a year.
[00:12:47] You're only seeing the tip of the iceberg real estate agent that's out there.
[00:12:49] You're not seeing all the other hard work that they put in there that they're committed
[00:12:53] to their business.
[00:12:55] I mean, those people that are selling 50 to $100 million in production a year, okay,
[00:13:00] and then they have beautiful reals or whatnot, those reals and that marketing came after
[00:13:06] all the other hard work and time enough for they put in to build their business.
[00:13:11] So that's a really good point is that so if I hear you correctly, and I just want to pause you
[00:13:16] because I think you're saying something really profound, which is utilizing social media while
[00:13:22] you're not busy might the better way to do that might be through what Ryan has said time and time
[00:13:28] again on the show is research and development.
[00:13:30] Learn, follow your, your, your sphere.
[00:13:34] Pay attention to what is going on in their lives because that will give you number one
[00:13:39] indications of possibly wanting to move, but also reasons to pick up the phone and call them.
[00:13:44] Hey, just saw you got back from a trip to Mexico.
[00:13:47] How did it go?
[00:13:48] Just was thinking about you looked awesome that kind of thing.
[00:13:50] I'm actually going in two days with Cole Vanker to their trip.
[00:13:54] I like to sell the Cole Vanker.
[00:13:57] I'm going to go to Mexico.
[00:13:59] I had, I had my, so we had our, we had our software Zanelo or a dashboard up at this coaching
[00:14:04] session and I was showing everybody in their network tab where I was like, look at all the hyperlinks
[00:14:09] that we have in here to, you know, DJ's Facebook page or DJ's Instagram page or DJ's
[00:14:15] LinkedIn page.
[00:14:17] And, and then I opened up Facebook and another tab and I said, here's the right way in the wrong way.
[00:14:23] You start in your dashboard first.
[00:14:27] You start there and you go one by one with each person and you look at, you click on their
[00:14:32] hyperlinks and you look at what's going on with them.
[00:14:34] If you start on Facebook first, you should say, alert, mayday, something's wrong because when you
[00:14:40] look at the newsfeed, you are seeing what Michael Zuckerberg wants you to see. Is it a name
[00:14:44] Mike Zuckerberg?
[00:14:46] Mark, but close enough.
[00:14:48] Right.
[00:14:48] Right.
[00:14:49] Mark, you're seeing what Mark Zuckerberg wants you to see in the newsfeed.
[00:14:52] You're seeing, you don't have control over.
[00:14:57] You're seeing what they want you to see.
[00:14:59] You don't scroll through your newsfeed.
[00:15:01] That's just how it worked.
[00:15:02] You have to be intentional just like success and anybody starts a business.
[00:15:07] You've got to be intentional on what it is that you want to do.
[00:15:10] But if you're passive and you're thumbing through Facebook news feeds, that's fine.
[00:15:17] But you're just wasting your day.
[00:15:18] You're wasting your valuable time and your time is so much more valuable than money.
[00:15:24] Okay.
[00:15:24] Your time is so valuable but so money of us in Robin Charmin says this and I love it.
[00:15:29] Some of us are so busy being busy.
[00:15:32] Very few of us are busy being productive.
[00:15:34] So there's a right way.
[00:15:35] There's a wrong way of doing it.
[00:15:37] And in these times where it quote unquote scary for people, look in the mirror.
[00:15:43] Have a direct conversation with yourself.
[00:15:45] Okay.
[00:15:46] And ask, are you doing the proper right things to be efficient in this market?
[00:15:50] Because anybody could be successful.
[00:15:52] I think the statistics came out eight home sell every minute.
[00:15:57] 11,000 homes sell a day.
[00:16:00] Right now there's more than enough business out there.
[00:16:03] It's just that when business was easy, everybody was coming to everybody.
[00:16:09] Now that it scares the first to flee are the negative mindset individuals.
[00:16:15] I want to pause you for a second.
[00:16:18] 
[00:16:19] Because I think you're saying something that's really important.
[00:16:22] I just want to put the cap on the social media conversation.
[00:16:28] Is that that this.
[00:16:29] So what Ryan was saying was, hey, if we were scrolling through social media,
[00:16:33] obviously that may sometimes show us information about our sphere that we could then use to call
[00:16:40] as information and say, hey, I saw you were just doing X, Y and Z.
[00:16:43] I saw your kids were doing X, Y and Z.
[00:16:45] But what Ryan was saying is to be really super intentional about it is to actually,
[00:16:49] you know, specifically search for that person.
[00:16:52] Look at their posts, see what they're up to.
[00:16:54] And then that gives you possibly a reason to reach out.
[00:16:57] You can also, by the way, do that via LinkedIn.
[00:17:00] So in LinkedIn, a lot of times when people get job promotions or switch companies,
[00:17:04] that information is also in their newsfeed.
[00:17:07] So you can use LinkedIn, Facebook, Instagram, and be really, really intentional
[00:17:13] about seeing what's going on in your clients or your sphere of influences life.
[00:17:19] And the reason why you want to do that is because it gives you a reason to pick up the
[00:17:24] phone and contact them or to send an email or a text or however you communicate with your sphere.
[00:17:30] This, and by the way, this is so much easier than trying to create a beautiful
[00:17:35] piece of content for you that you post on your stories, your real, your, you know,
[00:17:40] that's hard to do.
[00:17:42] And as Ryan said, that comes usually after.
[00:17:44] What you can do today for zero money is you can find out what's going on in people's lives and
[00:17:49] reach out to them and connect with them.
[00:17:52] Yeah, everybody really, everybody that I observe wants to make this about marketing.
[00:17:58] And it's, it's, it's, yes, there's marketing is important.
[00:18:02] But that's not, I mean, that's, that's the easy part, right?
[00:18:06] You have to get out of your comfort zone.
[00:18:08] You have to grow a network.
[00:18:10] You have to nourish the network.
[00:18:11] You have to take care of the network.
[00:18:13] If you don't, your business isn't going to grow.
[00:18:15] Period.
[00:18:16] It's just, it's just not.
[00:18:18] And the more, I guess the more communal your neighborhood is, the more work it's going to take.
[00:18:26] I mean, when I sold real estate in Chicago, the city of Chicago, it was actually easier
[00:18:31] than it would be in the suburbs because the suburbs are so tight knit, so community where
[00:18:35] this larger city say Chicago or Miami in the areas where I've coached agents.
[00:18:40] It's very transient, right?
[00:18:43] So because it's transient, it's easier to pick up an open house lead.
[00:18:45] It's easier to get an online web lead.
[00:18:47] The conversion rates higher because they don't have those connections, right?
[00:18:51] But if you take the time to say, I'm going to take care of this building that I live in,
[00:18:55] that I farm, I'm going to be a part of the social events.
[00:18:58] I'm going to get to know the people in the building.
[00:19:00] You'll dominate.
[00:19:00] You'll own that building.
[00:19:02] I owned the buildings now selling real estate in Chicago,
[00:19:05] that I farm because I got involved with them from a community.
[00:19:10] And it was easier, quite honestly, because there was such a lack of community
[00:19:15] in those bigger cities.
[00:19:16] Now when you're in the suburbs, right?
[00:19:19] And you're going to have the soccer teams and football teams and baseball and all the other stuff
[00:19:24] that comes along with families in the suburbs, right?
[00:19:31] Then you're going to have to get even more involved in there.
[00:19:35] Now, one thing that listeners might be thinking because I brought up the family element of it
[00:19:40] that somebody said to me on Saturday, he said,
[00:19:42] well, I don't have a family so is it harder for me to grow my business?
[00:19:46] Now this person has been a real estate agent for five years.
[00:19:49] And I pointed to an agent of ours that doesn't have a family, doesn't have any kids,
[00:19:53] and sells 64 homes a year.
[00:19:56] And I said, but look at his network.
[00:19:58] He's got 420 people in it.
[00:20:00] And every single quarter, he touches them.
[00:20:01] I said, I've never seen anybody work this system and not be a success.
[00:20:08] I've seen people not work it and be successful.
[00:20:10] I've seen people not work it and be failures, but I've never seen anybody work it and it doesn't
[00:20:16] work for them. But it takes a commitment. It takes, it takes drive, right?
[00:20:21] And it takes, it takes self-reliance.
[00:20:24] You've got to be responsible for yourself.
[00:20:27] You're called independent contractors for a reason,
[00:20:30] but it's going to take even more responsibility than it is when you get a job and you have a boss
[00:20:35] telling you what to do. You are the boss.
[00:20:37] So therefore you've got to be able to
[00:20:40] get a plan out your day and do what you need to do and execute it day in and day out.
[00:20:45] Or it's just not going to happen.
[00:20:47] And I think to this idea of earning business is, I think there's,
[00:20:51] well, a minimum of two different places where you need to earn business.
[00:20:55] And I'm curious to get your thoughts on this.
[00:20:57] And here's what I came up with.
[00:20:59] The first is you want, of course, your sphere.
[00:21:02] And I say, client, I should just say your sphere, your prospects.
[00:21:05] You want your prospects to think about you when they do need to work with a REALTOR.
[00:21:10] So you have to earn that position.
[00:21:11] So you first have to earn that.
[00:21:13] And then you also have to earn once they're ready to make a decision that you are,
[00:21:16] in fact, the right person.
[00:21:18] So you first want to be thought of and then you want to be selected.
[00:21:21] And I was thinking, but you do have to earn that, right?
[00:21:24] And you have to earn it through effort.
[00:21:27] And Ryan, you've said this time and time again on our show.
[00:21:30] Social media is a great place to get information to allow you
[00:21:34] to show you the steps to earn these deeper connections, earn these deals
[00:21:39] through deeper connection, through intimacy,
[00:21:42] through understanding what's going on in my client's lives.
[00:21:45] And that's as simple as paying attention and reaching out and saying,
[00:21:49] hey, I saw that you just did this.
[00:21:51] I saw that you guys just had a birthday.
[00:21:53] I saw, you know, there's all sorts of things that social media tells us about our
[00:21:57] sphere of influence.
[00:21:59] And all we have to do is acknowledge it,
[00:22:02] tell them we're watching, we're and we're proud of them or we're excited for them or whatever
[00:22:06] the particular instance might be.
[00:22:08] We have to do this on the regular so that we can even be thought about when it comes time for
[00:22:13] real estate. I'll tell you one thing I did about a year, a couple of years ago was I have had
[00:22:20] an assistant. And I said to my assistant, I said, I don't know any of my friends, birthdays,
[00:22:24] anniversaries, I don't know their children's birthdays.
[00:22:27] These are my friends.
[00:22:28] And I said, I want to be the friend that knows all of his friends
[00:22:31] that doesn't miss a birthday, doesn't miss an anniversary, doesn't miss.
[00:22:36] So I said, can you reach out to all my friends and just ask them, we're updating our database,
[00:22:42] we DJ doesn't want to forget your birthday.
[00:22:44] And we got their wedding anniversaries, we got their kids birthdays, I know the ages of their kids.
[00:22:50] No, I'm not a practicing agent, but I'm doing this just for my own, my own relationships with
[00:22:55] my friends. But this is the exact same thing you can do with your sphere and it gives you reasons
[00:23:00] to reach out, to stay in communication, to build community. But in order to build community,
[00:23:06] you have to actually build a community, you have to actually want to have deeper connections
[00:23:11] with your with your sphere.
[00:23:13] That's absolutely right. That's exactly what you have to do. And it takes time.
[00:23:18] And it's like a river running through a canyon or whatnot. It will carve against stone with
[00:23:28] the consistency, day in and day out. It's not a one and done thing. The most important part of
[00:23:33] all of this is being consistent with these activities. It's it's not like there's no silver bullet out
[00:23:38] there. It is, it is time its effort. If you nurture it, it will pay huge dividends to you.
[00:23:45] I want to pause for a moment to talk about our episode sponsor, one of my favorite companies out
[00:23:50] there follow up boss. Now, after interviewing hundreds of top REALTORS in the country for the
[00:23:55] podcast, you know, which CRM is used by more than any other buyer guests? Of course, it is follow

[00:24:58] your free 30 day trial. Follow up like a boss with follow up boss. And now back to our episode.
[00:25:06] It will, but you're right. It takes outgoing effort outbound effort. So in the past, it used to be
[00:25:11] pick up the phone. We call somebody. Hey, are you thinking about selling? No, not yet. Okay, I'll
[00:25:17] you later. There are much better ways to do that now. And I think the best way to do that is to be
[00:25:24] entwined with or at least aware of the happenings of your prospects lives so that you can
[00:25:33] know and give them advice along the way. And that they go, wow, my agent called me. They saw that
[00:25:41] my partner just got a promotion. They called it congratulate me. I mean, those types of things,
[00:25:46] whenever, whenever somebody does something special in their life, whether it's with their family
[00:25:51] or their profession, if somebody else comes along and says, hey, I saw that you did that thing.
[00:25:56] Boy, that goes a heck of a long way to building, building, you know, in deer mint.
[00:26:01] It does. Yeah. And it's all out there for you to know what's going on with these individuals. I mean,
[00:26:06] today, it's so easy. Everybody's living their lives publicly. So it's easy to see what's going on.
[00:26:12] But again, be intentional about that research and development that you're doing and what you're
[00:26:17] seeing. Just don't blindly log in and go through newsfeed. You're going to be doing what the algorithms
[00:26:21] want you to see. You have to be intentional and look up your network, see what's going out with
[00:26:26] them. And then don't do it. Don't consider writing on the wall, you know, like a touch. You know,
[00:26:34] you have to pick up the phone. You need to text them. You get that reach out with them and create a
[00:26:39] dialogue. And remember Ford, right? Family occupation, recreation and dreams, ask open any
[00:26:43] questions, right? You know, how's Little Billy doing, right? Or, or he, how's it? How's the new
[00:26:49] job at, at, you know, Pepsi, whatnot? I just saw you got promoted to direct your finance. How's
[00:26:56] it going? What, tell me about that. Let them then tell them about you. You know, have learned the
[00:27:01] art of conversing with individuals, right? Open any conversations. And remember, it's more about
[00:27:06] them than as you. They're going to give you so much valuable data. And then when they have a
[00:27:12] need in 16 percent of your network, trans X every single year, when they have a need, they're going
[00:27:17] to think of their friend, right? And that's you, right? And, and I tell the way, like I love this
[00:27:21] business because you're in the business of creating friends. Yeah. So get to work.
[00:27:27] The other thing too, if you're a brand new agent, I've never really heard anyone say this. So
[00:27:31] I'm curious, you, you might have a different opinion. You might say this is a terrible idea.
[00:27:35] But my first glance, my first thought is that it's a good idea, but I could be wrong. So if I were
[00:27:41] a brand new agent, and I had a bunch of friends that owned homes, that maybe weren't even thinking
[00:27:46] of selling, what every homeowner, or at least what most homeowners who aren't in the process of
[00:27:52] selling still like to know is what's their place worth. You know, at any given regular day, we can go
[00:27:57] to Zillow and look at the Zestimate. I don't ever think to do that. But sometimes people do, but
[00:28:02] you're a real estate professional. You can actually provide most likely a more accurate thing. So what I
[00:28:07] would do is I would call everybody I know who owns a house if I was new and say, hey, I know you're
[00:28:11] not looking to buy your cell anytime soon, but I really want to send you a comp because I want
[00:28:17] to practice and I want to get better at sending comps. Is it okay if I send you what I think your
[00:28:22] home is currently worth? Just would love to get your review on it. It'll help me in my skill, you
[00:28:27] know, building my skills. If these are your closest people to you, I think they'd be like, great,
[00:28:31] send it over. I'm curious what you thought of that. If they're, if, I mean, reaching out to them and
[00:28:38] asking for a brand new agent, hey, I don't have any clients. I just want to get some practice,
[00:28:43] you know, running CMAs, that kind of thing. I would run a CMA, but I wouldn't send it to, I wouldn't
[00:28:49] send it to, I don't think I would send it to, to them. You wouldn't. Okay. No, I wouldn't. I want
[00:28:55] you to focus more on the relationship building aspect of it. They're going to find out what you're
[00:28:59] doing through your auto flow, your direct mail, your email marketing, you know, some of the social
[00:29:03] media, they're going to know what you're doing. Make friends with them first. They're going to ask you
[00:29:07] about real estate. If they ask you about comps, then you run some comps. Now, you should, what you
[00:29:13] shouldn't be doing, you should be running comps on homes, you know, but I want to be sending them out.
[00:29:17] You should be running them, going to your man, you broke, and saying, what do you think about this?
[00:29:20] I think this home should be priced here based on the comps that I ran. You should be maybe talking
[00:29:25] to some friends and saying, hey, listen, why don't you come see some open houses with me. I want to go
[00:29:29] around. I want to get the know of the marketplace. I love a friend to come with me and also, hey,
[00:29:33] let's go right up, pretend to offer. I'm not going to present it, but let's go take a purchase
[00:29:36] contract. Let's go get a cup of coffee. I'm going to fill out a contract. I'm going to explain to
[00:29:40] you a contract. Would you mind me practicing on you? That's what you do with what really good friend
[00:29:45] of yours. That's going to give you some real life experience, right? But, you know, I'm of the mindset
[00:29:50] of your touches, your outreach, just should all be relationship. It should be all about them.
[00:29:56] Real estate will naturally flow to you. I agree. You're right. It's funny. I was talking about
[00:30:05] putting everyone's anniversaries and birthdays in my calendar. Now, because I do that, especially
[00:30:12] wedding anniversaries, I routinely get messages from my friends that go, you're the only person
[00:30:18] outside of my immediate family that knows it's my anniversary. Am I such an amazing guy that I,
[00:30:23] because I do that? No, I just put it in my calendar. I literally just did the one thing,
[00:30:29] and how would that make that person feel about me remembering their most special day of their life,
[00:30:35] right? Or the birth of a child, or whatever it might be, the major life events. If you can somehow
[00:30:42] be there after the event happens to congratulate the person, boy, that demonstrates a tremendous
[00:30:53] effort. Absolutely. And that's what it's all about. It's always about them. It's not about you.
[00:30:58] And it's all about you showing how much you care about them through your actions, even more so
[00:31:03] than your words. And that's being consistent and continually reaching out to them. Again, the numbers
[00:31:07] will just take care of it for you. The numbers will just... So, here's a question. But rates are really
[00:31:13] high right now. I'm an agent. None of my buyers. They're all upset about rates.
[00:31:20] So, I'm just giving a devil's advocate. What do you say to that? About rates?
[00:31:26] Okay, great. And you're a buyer? Wonderful. Why are you buying?
[00:31:33] Because I need more space. Okay. So, the listeners pay close attention to this.
[00:31:39] Right? It's the why. So, why do you need more space?
[00:31:43] So that I can work from home a couple days a week. And I need a home office.
[00:31:48] Why do you want to work from home a couple days a week? So that I can...
[00:31:55] Because it's more comfortable for me, I don't want to commute in every day. So, I, you know,
[00:32:00] I'll slide my time. How long do you need it? 30 minutes. So, is that an hour a day then?
[00:32:06] It's 30 minutes. Yes. You're going to commute in what? In a
[00:32:10] commuting five days a week then if you're not working from home? Correct. So, that's five hours a day.
[00:32:16] Right. Right. It's 20 hours a month. Right? So, you know, and take that, that's 240 hours in a year.
[00:32:26] Yeah. Depended by 24 hours. How many days of that? So, those are the things I ask you, DJ, as my friend and
[00:32:33] my buyer, you know, what is it to you that's more important? Is it a, say, a six percent interest rate
[00:32:41] on a 300,000-hour loan, right? Versus maybe drop down to five and a quarter a year from now.
[00:32:47] So that three quarters of a point difference. What does that come out to? And then you've got to
[00:32:52] ask yourself, what's more important to you? Five days in the car, 30 minutes each way, or being
[00:32:58] working from home? I can't answer that. Only you can. My friend buying the home. You make that
[00:33:03] decision. You tell me if you're wise strong enough for you to buy the home. Right. So, the rates just
[00:33:09] kind of are what they are. And I think most of our listeners have heard the expression, you know,
[00:33:16] marry the home date, the rate. It's not an expression. It's an overused expression, but it's
[00:33:21] it's a pretty good one because it is actually how most people think about purchasing property.
[00:33:27] They fall in love with the home and whatever the rate is is and people can refinance, of course,
[00:33:32] thank goodness. So, most agents will ask these questions, DJ, but they don't even have the buyer
[00:33:39] client yet. They ask if people are building up their building up objections and their heads are
[00:33:44] already because they've got to do the life flow that's necessary for them to grow their business.
[00:33:48] Does that tell you a little bit more about life flow? Yeah, life flow is simply touching everybody
[00:33:53] in your database. I think you do it once a month, right? Personally, by, you know, a text to call,
[00:33:59] right? Maybe a Facebook messenger to them about them and checking in with them. You know,
[00:34:05] keeping keeping current with them and keeping them in your life and you in theirs.
[00:34:12] So, if you have say 300 people in your network, okay, do you have a calculator with you because I
[00:34:19] don't, I'm pacing. Yes, I do. Okay, great. So, there's there are 20 working days in a month,
[00:34:26] okay? So, what's 23 divided by, or what's 300 divided by 20?
[00:34:32] About 15. 15? Yep. 15. You have to make 15 touches a day.
[00:34:39] 15 touches a day. Now, do that for a full year and a row, followed up with a consistent marketing
[00:34:44] campaign. Now, take 300 and multiply it by 0.16. I think I'll come to 48. Yeah, 48. That's 48
[00:34:52] transactions that are living in that database of 300 people. 16% of them are going to transact.
[00:34:59] Regardless of the market, they're going to transact. A lot of them might even transact twice.
[00:35:04] Right. They might sell my mind. Yeah, sell my mind. But here's the
[00:35:08] reality is maybe 5% or less of real estate agents are actually going to do the activities they
[00:35:12] need to do and do those 15 touches a day. I've seen the time in and time out. Right. That's
[00:35:19] that's going to separate you guys from the struggling real estate agent to the very few top
[00:35:24] producers that are actually out there. And plus like if you really think about it and again,
[00:35:29] everybody's personalities are different, but I would assume it's a lot more fun to contact
[00:35:34] somebody and you know, you look to see what they're doing on social. You know, you have a reason
[00:35:41] to call them. They just did something on social media that you want to acknowledge or there's
[00:35:45] something going on in the market that you want to make them aware of. Either way, this should all
[00:35:50] be fun, positive stuff. Right. So making 15 phone calls a day going, yeah, I was just thinking about
[00:35:55] you. So I you just went on a trip. So you're so and so just got promoted. So you guys just had
[00:36:00] an anniversary of birthday. Oh, by the way, here's something that's going on in the market that you
[00:36:04] might care about down the street or whatever. Those are all fun activities. DJ, I would even leave
[00:36:10] that out of it. Okay. That last part. Okay. I would even leave that part out of it. I would leave
[00:36:17] bringing it back to real estate out of it. Does that make sense? Yeah, just just connect with them
[00:36:22] at person. That's that's how I feel just connect with them. Focus on the relationship. Leave
[00:36:28] anything about your business out of it. They will ask you. Here's how you do it. Okay. DJ,
[00:36:33] we're in a roleplay here. You're an accountant. Okay. Okay. And say you're an accountant at a big,
[00:36:39] you know, one of the big five firms. Okay. Okay. DJ, how's business?
[00:36:43] Well, oh, I'm slammed. It's a kind of it's the beginning of the year. Everyone's working on their
[00:36:48] taxes. It's brutal right now. I'm slammed. That's crazy. What are you working on?
[00:36:53] Corporate tax taxes are due. Just clients are asking for everything for just shore up their year.
[00:36:59] That's crazy years isn't it? Yeah. Now, what are you going to say to me eventually?
[00:37:05] I'm going to say, Hey, what's going on with you? What's what what are you up to? Right.
[00:37:09] Now, here's my chance. Just busy running around works crazy. Family's great. How's the market? How's
[00:37:15] how's the real estate? There you go. Right? Works great. Finally, then you just say, okay,
[00:37:19] how's the market? Now, I'm not going in every call thinking that through. In fact, I tend to throw
[00:37:24] scripts away. Right? I just go and make it about the person somehow, usually sometimes that all
[00:37:30] the time work will pop up. But if I talk to you once a month, I text with you once a month,
[00:37:35] I send you a Facebook messenger once a month. Two years go by, I'm your buddy. You know what the
[00:37:40] hell I do for living. And when you are looking to either purchase your home or or or or or sell a home,
[00:37:47] there's a really strong possibility. I'm the guy you're calling. Why? Because I did my job.
[00:37:53] I kept you close to me. I kept the relationship with you.
[00:37:58] Yeah, this is this reminds me of an old Brian Tracy expression and we're not really putting this
[00:38:04] in the prospecting category. But one of my favorite Brian Tracy quotes is prospecting solve
[00:38:09] solve problems or sales solve all problems. And of course, of course, he's right. And so what we're
[00:38:16] really doing is even though we're not prospecting with a capital P, what we're doing is we are
[00:38:22] prospecting because we are staying in touch with our sphere. We know people are going to choose their
[00:38:27] real term. Most people are going to choose based on who they know like and trust. You have to
[00:38:31] earn that. You have to earn no like and trust. So the way that you earn it is exactly how Ryan is
[00:38:37] describing it here. And if you just do this this year and you you know, you find what 15 phone calls
[00:38:45] a day if you have 300 people in your database, 15 touches a day, what is that might take what three
[00:38:51] hours a day? Maybe maybe maybe two hours a day, maybe even less. That is a remarkable low amount of
[00:38:57] effort for building intimacy. And I'm sorry, not a low in a bad way. That's a very reasonable
[00:39:03] amount of time to spend. And that will actually result in business. That's absolutely right. And
[00:39:15] I've seen agents that I'm a very empathetic individual. Don't get me wrong, right? But I've seen agents
[00:39:21] struggle. And I've seen them complain about it. But then I've also watched them do nothing about it.
[00:39:26] Yeah. I watch them do nothing about it. Right. And I've watched them look around to say what's
[00:39:32] going to solve my problem? Guys, there's no silver bullet out there. You got to get to work.
[00:39:37] You know, look at every professional out there that's successful in any industry. You know,
[00:39:42] it's so funny. Yeah. You know, again, I worked with a lot of new agents and brought them up. Right.
[00:39:47] And the first years, a lot of emotional intelligence, I have to work with them on. Right. Because
[00:39:52] they comment they might be coming to the business in their 40s. Right. And then they're going to
[00:39:56] look at the friend like, well, he or she's so successful. Like, well, they've been at their career
[00:39:59] for 20 years. They've been building the career for a long time. Why are you expecting to be a number one
[00:40:06] agent within 12 months? It makes no sense. And then why if you're seven years of you not doing what
[00:40:12] you really need to do or you upset that you're you've plateaued and you're really not where you should
[00:40:16] be? Well, that's because you just gone through time. Like anybody's going to be I think it was
[00:40:21] Gary color wrote in his book, Marin, millionaire, real estate agent, the Muthusilov fact. You know,
[00:40:27] who Muthusilized, right? Yes. Right. And so you're going to be in this business for 20 years.
[00:40:33] Eventually, you're going to have enough business. Just you just want to go through 20 years
[00:40:38] of being in real estate to finally hit your stride. Right. And there are a lot of agents
[00:40:43] I know that have been in the business for seven, eight, nine years that are finally hitting the
[00:40:46] stride. That's just because they've been in it for seven, eight, nine years. Right. You know,
[00:40:51] it's they're not really probably should be. Yeah, it's it's a really it's a really good point.
[00:40:58] It's and also it's what's nice about having sort of, you know, your live flow like you were
[00:41:04] say, would life flow equals connection with your your sphere? What what is so amazing about that
[00:41:10] is it has nothing to do with the market has nothing to do with the conditions of the economy.
[00:41:14] It's just interpersonal communication. This is something that that you can do on your best day,
[00:41:22] your worst day, whatever's going on in your life, you can always pick up the phone, reach out to
[00:41:26] somebody and and do this regardless of the market conditions or what's going on in in your business.
[00:41:32] So what's what's wonderful is if you can put the blinders on it does it does it matter if rates
[00:41:38] are up or down. I mean, of course that affects your client's ability to buy or sell certain things,
[00:41:43] but you want to always demonstrate care, compassion, you know, and connection. Absolutely. It's
[00:41:51] always it's I say ABC always be connecting people say it's always be close is always be connecting.
[00:41:58] Always keep in contact with people and then the sales will just follow you.
[00:42:05] That's that's a great great thing to end on and a great reminder for all of us that are
[00:42:11] noticing all of the job cuts that are going on in the real estate world and all of the the just
[00:42:15] the noise with with of course economists predicting by the way I just went to an NAR conference
[00:42:22] or saw the NAR chief economist speak Dr. Lawrence Yoon a couple days or last week and
[00:42:29] and by the way he thinks that the the housing market is going to be just fine. He does not think
[00:42:36] this will repeat back to 2008 2009 10 etc. So he was he was very excited that things will be
[00:42:44] returning to normal in the next year or two, but in the meantime and you should be doing this
[00:42:49] regardless of whether it's a up down up market down market rental market, you know, buy or sell
[00:42:54] or market connect with your your spear. There's always going to be people like Ryan's at 16% of the
[00:42:59] people you know are going to transact in the next 24 months. That's just a fact. So how much yeah
[00:43:06] I'm sorry in the next 12 months 16% will transact in the next 12 months. Some of those will have two
[00:43:11] transactions. Some will have one. So you have a huge opportunity here, but you have to earn it
[00:43:18] and the way that you earn it is through as Ryan just said ABC always be connecting. Find out
[00:43:24] the these things and guys this is the fun part of the job. The hard parts actually working with
[00:43:29] with the client that's actually the tough part. This is the fun part where you actually get to
[00:43:34] demonstrate that you care that you you know this is the stuff that you should get excited about
[00:43:38] because it doesn't require a whole lot of knowledge or skill just requires a little bit of effort
[00:43:42] and and it requires that you do care about your your clients and if you do care about them demonstrate
[00:43:48] it and they will they will be with you forever. Well Ryan well I think it's a great place to pause.
[00:43:56] We are again congratulations on the merger with with cobalt banker that is incredible. So
[00:44:03] so excited and proud of you and and all of your agents I'm sure are thrilled about that and

Thanks DJ, thanks for having me. Appreciate it. It's good to be back. It's been a little bit since I've seen it. Been with you. It's been a while and we have, I have some congratulations in order that you have now joined forces with Colble Banker. We have, yes, yeah. So I've been working on that with them for the past few months and it's been exciting. It's a great, great group of people over there and very excited about that. And we get to take two wonderful cultures and meldingly gather and work with an organization that has basically a wonderful global presence. A lot of value added to our agents. I'm incredibly excited. My wife's an agent at the company. So I just excited from all the things that I saw that they have access to makes me very excited. And then I get to, I get to coach and I get to even coach even more people, which makes me, makes me excited about the whole opportunity as well. And it's also, I want this to be inspiring to for anyone who's in the process of building a team or thinking of starting a brokerage. If you don't mind Ryan, just sharing just maybe a minute or so, a minute or two of the journey from being your own managing broker, starting a firm and now all these years later integrating it with Colble Banker. Yeah, you know, it's, it is, it's quite a journey. It starts off with anything that you do. It's, you know, it's something that you're very passionate about. And I started the real estate company because I was very passionate about coaching agents and helping them develop. And we built our company off of that about probably, you know, you know, our company did in 21. We did about $1.2 billion. You know, yeah, 21. We did about 1.2 billion in sales in 2022, which is a down year for everybody. We did over a billion dollars, but we were down. But it's something to be really proud of the hangar hat on and probably 85% of our agents started their career at our company and probably allow them. It was only seven or eight years ago and we were putting up some pretty, pretty big numbers, which we were really proud of. And you know, that is based on something I was very passionate about. I was working individually with the agents. I, this past Saturday, you know, the company sold and this past Saturday, I was at one of our offices with a bunch of agents and I was doing a group coaching session and it's allowed me to get back to what I was passionate, really passionate about. The company grew, it grew quite large and I started to find that my desire, my past passion of coaching and training was being overshadowed by a lot of administrative stuff. As you know, running a real estate company, there is more to it than meets the eye, I guess. Let's just put it that way. It's a lot of work. So by joining forces with Colt Little Banker, it allowed me to get what I would get to what I'm more passionate about, which is working with each individual agent. Also, blown off serves, I coach blown officers, I coach title sales reps, I coach insurance, agents, anybody who's in sales, I coach them, I help them, you know, set a goal and then create a path to where they want to get to. Yeah, it's amazing and I just, I know you're a very humble person but I do want to stress that you built a company, an independent brokerage here in Chicago, you competed with the biggest and the best and you built a business that really was, you know, is as big and as powerful and as impressive as the big franchise firms and that in and of itself is a very difficult thing to do. And so I just want to honor you for building up a company, a healthy company, a healthy wonderful position and what a wonderful testament to how you built your business so that all these other brokerages wanted to join forces with you. So, glad you landed with Colt Little Banker, our company, our managing broker started at Colt Little Banker, we're big fans, of course of them as well. So congratulations to all the agents at Deapral and you've got a great journey ahead of you and really exciting. Thanks, thanks, yeah, I am excited. And, you know, yeah, it is one of the things we reflect back, I was telling my wife, you know, I never really paused because I was running so hard these past 11 years growing the organization and it was, you know, after the sale, I looked back and said to myself, Jesus Christ, I am probably one of the most competitive real estate markets in the country. Yeah. Which, cargo is brutal. Brutal. It's very competitive and so I did have a moment of pride where I've always kind of never really taken the time to do that and I did and thank you, I appreciate you saying that. Yeah, it's a big deal and very few independent firms have done it. So that is a real feather in your cap and obviously again, really highlights your ability to grow a business and keep your agents happy and keep them productive and keep them, probably keep the business profitable. So speaking of all of that, it is 2023. It's our first coaching moments of the year and everybody I know whether they're a broker owner or a team leader or just an individual producing agent, everybody I know seems to be a little scared, nervous, worried about what's going on, what's right in front of them, what they should be focused on so they don't get caught up in, you know, in action or, you know, just the business cycle is being changed, changing it currently. So I would love to know as a coach what you are saying, what are you hearing out there and what you're recommending to agents who are a little nervous or scared about where we are right now in the housing. Sure. Yeah, absolutely. Well, so the first thing to keep in mind, there's a tremendous amount of distractions. Look, we just saw the company and I think every single recruiter in Chicago land area is my agents numbers on speed dial and they're calling it over and over and over. It is a recruiting for people like me and by the way, I've not been doing that to your agents, but because we don't really compete in that same way, but I recruiters are having a field day right now. Now is the time when agents are struggling so the recruiters come out and they promise the world and every agent, every one of our listeners is probably getting prospected by somebody in their local markets. You know, and for the people who are listening to that are real estate agents that are not on the corporate side or the relocation or the corporate side or the recruiting side, you know, you got to listen to the message. The message is overwhelmingly becoming to my agents has been messages of fear. And majority of people will be able to be scared. And it's a shame. You should be inspiring, leading by inspiration. You should be, you know, you should lead by hope. You should not be, you know, leading by fear, which is basically manipulating somebody to get what you want by scaring them. And there's a lot of scary things that are out there and kind of really be smart and who you align yourself with. And you know, when times are rough, I mean, again, I've been through this in the great recession and here we are in another difficult market. You know, when times are rough, everybody is going to look outside of themselves first and make the change. Look a year ago, you know, a year ago before I was even thinking about selling anything on the start came a number of agents left my company. They leave every year. They were all top producing agents. And unfortunately, all but one shit the bet. And the reason being, I think is that we had such a strong culture of accountability and whatnot and some of the excuses when I just say, like, well, look at these tools and these technology and this and that. There's tools, technology and gizmos. They're going to calm and they're going to go. There is nothing that is earth shattering about what we do. Anybody could say tech and tools and technology. The truth is, I even going to open up the computer six weeks later and use the technology that they gave you and really what difference is it. And so what everybody does when they're trying to improve, right? They change everything outside first. That's why 93% of them don't improve. The work comes from within. If you want different results, you need to change. That doesn't mean you need to change companies. And I'm not talking about my company. I'm talking about any industry, whatever. It means you personally have got to change. You know, it lies within what are you doing? What are your activities? I'm Saturday when I was with the group of agents and I was coaching them. One of them said, look, you know, I'm doing this and I'm doing this and I, and I, and I time block, excuse me, I set up my all my social media posts for months in advance. And she looked at me and like, and she's like, well, I go ahead and I pre-plan this stuff. I'm like, and she's like, well, what do you mean? And I'm like, well, that's not what moves the needle in your business. I mean, that's not, I mean, social media marketing, okay, is seen by majority of the people that have already liked your post. Probably 94% of them are your fellow real estate agents that are saying, go ahead, friend, good for you and they're liking your stuff. It's going to the same people over and over again. If you're doing social media, if you're using social media by marketing versus researching and developing, right, then you're going about this business, relationship building, business the wrong way. And when you point to some of the top, top people out there, right, that have beautiful social media marketing out there, but they're also selling 30, 40, 50, $100 million real estate a year. You're only seeing the tip of the iceberg real estate agent that's out there. You're not seeing all the other hard work that they put in there that they're committed to their business. I mean, those people that are selling 50 to $100 million in production a year, okay, and then they have beautiful reals or whatnot, those reals and that marketing came after all the other hard work and time enough for they put in to build their business. So that's a really good point is that so if I hear you correctly, and I just want to pause you because I think you're saying something really profound, which is utilizing social media while you're not busy might the better way to do that might be through what Ryan has said time and time again on the show is research and development. Learn, follow your, your, your sphere. Pay attention to what is going on in their lives because that will give you number one indications of possibly wanting to move, but also reasons to pick up the phone and call them. Hey, just saw you got back from a trip to Mexico. How did it go? Just was thinking about you looked awesome that kind of thing. I'm actually going in two days with Cole Vanker to their trip. I like to sell the Cole Vanker. I'm going to go to Mexico. I had, I had my, so we had our, we had our software Zanelo or a dashboard up at this coaching session and I was showing everybody in their network tab where I was like, look at all the hyperlinks that we have in here to, you know, DJ's Facebook page or DJ's Instagram page or DJ's LinkedIn page. And, and then I opened up Facebook and another tab and I said, here's the right way in the wrong way. You start in your dashboard first. You start there and you go one by one with each person and you look at, you click on their hyperlinks and you look at what's going on with them. If you start on Facebook first, you should say, alert, mayday, something's wrong because when you look at the newsfeed, you are seeing what Michael Zuckerberg wants you to see. Is it a name Mike Zuckerberg? Mark, but close enough. Right. Right. Mark, you're seeing what Mark Zuckerberg wants you to see in the newsfeed. You're seeing, you don't have control over. You're seeing what they want you to see. You don't scroll through your newsfeed. That's just how it worked. You have to be intentional just like success and anybody starts a business. You've got to be intentional on what it is that you want to do. But if you're passive and you're thumbing through Facebook news feeds, that's fine. But you're just wasting your day. You're wasting your valuable time and your time is so much more valuable than money. Okay. Your time is so valuable but so money of us in Robin Charmin says this and I love it. Some of us are so busy being busy. Very few of us are busy being productive. So there's a right way. There's a wrong way of doing it. And in these times where it quote unquote scary for people, look in the mirror. Have a direct conversation with yourself. Okay. And ask, are you doing the proper right things to be efficient in this market? Because anybody could be successful. I think the statistics came out eight home sell every minute. 11,000 homes sell a day. Right now there's more than enough business out there. It's just that when business was easy, everybody was coming to everybody. Now that it scares the first to flee are the negative mindset individuals. I want to pause you for a second. Because I think you're saying something that's really important. I just want to put the cap on the social media conversation. Is that that this. So what Ryan was saying was, hey, if we were scrolling through social media, obviously that may sometimes show us information about our sphere that we could then use to call as information and say, hey, I saw you were just doing X, Y and Z. I saw your kids were doing X, Y and Z. But what Ryan was saying is to be really super intentional about it is to actually, you know, specifically search for that person. Look at their posts, see what they're up to. And then that gives you possibly a reason to reach out. You can also, by the way, do that via LinkedIn. So in LinkedIn, a lot of times when people get job promotions or switch companies, that information is also in their newsfeed. So you can use LinkedIn, Facebook, Instagram, and be really, really intentional about seeing what's going on in your clients or your sphere of influences life. And the reason why you want to do that is because it gives you a reason to pick up the phone and contact them or to send an email or a text or however you communicate with your sphere. This, and by the way, this is so much easier than trying to create a beautiful piece of content for you that you post on your stories, your real, your, you know, that's hard to do. And as Ryan said, that comes usually after. What you can do today for zero money is you can find out what's going on in people's lives and reach out to them and connect with them. Yeah, everybody really, everybody that I observe wants to make this about marketing. And it's, it's, it's, yes, there's marketing is important. But that's not, I mean, that's, that's the easy part, right? You have to get out of your comfort zone. You have to grow a network. You have to nourish the network. You have to take care of the network. If you don't, your business isn't going to grow. Period. It's just, it's just not. And the more, I guess the more communal your neighborhood is, the more work it's going to take. I mean, when I sold real estate in Chicago, the city of Chicago, it was actually easier than it would be in the suburbs because the suburbs are so tight knit, so community where this larger city say Chicago or Miami in the areas where I've coached agents. It's very transient, right? So because it's transient, it's easier to pick up an open house lead. It's easier to get an online web lead. The conversion rates higher because they don't have those connections, right? But if you take the time to say, I'm going to take care of this building that I live in, that I farm, I'm going to be a part of the social events. I'm going to get to know the people in the building. You'll dominate. You'll own that building. I owned the buildings now selling real estate in Chicago, that I farm because I got involved with them from a community. And it was easier, quite honestly, because there was such a lack of community in those bigger cities. Now when you're in the suburbs, right? And you're going to have the soccer teams and football teams and baseball and all the other stuff that comes along with families in the suburbs, right? Then you're going to have to get even more involved in there. Now, one thing that listeners might be thinking because I brought up the family element of it that somebody said to me on Saturday, he said, well, I don't have a family so is it harder for me to grow my business? Now this person has been a real estate agent for five years. And I pointed to an agent of ours that doesn't have a family, doesn't have any kids, and sells 64 homes a year. And I said, but look at his network. He's got 420 people in it. And every single quarter, he touches them. I said, I've never seen anybody work this system and not be a success. I've seen people not work it and be successful. I've seen people not work it and be failures, but I've never seen anybody work it and it doesn't work for them. But it takes a commitment. It takes, it takes drive, right? And it takes, it takes self-reliance. You've got to be responsible for yourself. You're called independent contractors for a reason, but it's going to take even more responsibility than it is when you get a job and you have a boss telling you what to do. You are the boss. So therefore you've got to be able to get a plan out your day and do what you need to do and execute it day in and day out. Or it's just not going to happen. And I think to this idea of earning business is, I think there's, well, a minimum of two different places where you need to earn business. And I'm curious to get your thoughts on this. And here's what I came up with. The first is you want, of course, your sphere. And I say, client, I should just say your sphere, your prospects. You want your prospects to think about you when they do need to work with a REALTOR. So you have to earn that position. So you first have to earn that. And then you also have to earn once they're ready to make a decision that you are, in fact, the right person. So you first want to be thought of and then you want to be selected. And I was thinking, but you do have to earn that, right? And you have to earn it through effort. And Ryan, you've said this time and time again on our show. Social media is a great place to get information to allow you to show you the steps to earn these deeper connections, earn these deals through deeper connection, through intimacy, through understanding what's going on in my client's lives. And that's as simple as paying attention and reaching out and saying, hey, I saw that you just did this. I saw that you guys just had a birthday. I saw, you know, there's all sorts of things that social media tells us about our sphere of influence. And all we have to do is acknowledge it, tell them we're watching, we're and we're proud of them or we're excited for them or whatever the particular instance might be. We have to do this on the regular so that we can even be thought about when it comes time for real estate. I'll tell you one thing I did about a year, a couple of years ago was I have had an assistant. And I said to my assistant, I said, I don't know any of my friends, birthdays, anniversaries, I don't know their children's birthdays. These are my friends. And I said, I want to be the friend that knows all of his friends that doesn't miss a birthday, doesn't miss an anniversary, doesn't miss. So I said, can you reach out to all my friends and just ask them, we're updating our database, we DJ doesn't want to forget your birthday. And we got their wedding anniversaries, we got their kids birthdays, I know the ages of their kids. No, I'm not a practicing agent, but I'm doing this just for my own, my own relationships with my friends. But this is the exact same thing you can do with your sphere and it gives you reasons to reach out, to stay in communication, to build community. But in order to build community, you have to actually build a community, you have to actually want to have deeper connections with your with your sphere. That's absolutely right. That's exactly what you have to do. And it takes time. And it's like a river running through a canyon or whatnot. It will carve against stone with the consistency, day in and day out. It's not a one and done thing. The most important part of all of this is being consistent with these activities. It's it's not like there's no silver bullet out there. It is, it is time its effort. If you nurture it, it will pay huge dividends to you. I want to pause for a moment to talk about our episode sponsor, one of my favorite companies out there follow up boss. Now, after interviewing hundreds of top REALTORS in the country for the podcast, you know, which CRM is used by more than any other buyer guests? Of course, it is follow up boss. And let's face it, following up is the key to taking your business to the next level. Follow up boss will help you drive more leads in less time and with less effort. Do not take my word for it. Robert Slack, who runs the number one team in the US uses follow up boss and he is built of one and a half billion dollar business in just six years. Follow up boss integrates with over 250 systems so you can keep your current tools and lead sources. Also, the best part, they have seven day a week support. So you'll get the help that you need when you need it and get this follow up boss is so sure that you're going to love their CRM that for a limited time they're offering keeping it real listeners a 30 day free trial, which is twice as much time as they give everyone else. And oh yeah, no credit card required. So you can try it risk free, but only if you use this special link, visit followupboss.com forward slash real. That's followupboss.com forward slash real for your free 30 day trial. Follow up like a boss with follow up boss. And now back to our episode. It will, but you're right. It takes outgoing effort outbound effort. So in the past, it used to be pick up the phone. We call somebody. Hey, are you thinking about selling? No, not yet. Okay, I'll you later. There are much better ways to do that now. And I think the best way to do that is to be entwined with or at least aware of the happenings of your prospects lives so that you can know and give them advice along the way. And that they go, wow, my agent called me. They saw that my partner just got a promotion. They called it congratulate me. I mean, those types of things, whenever, whenever somebody does something special in their life, whether it's with their family or their profession, if somebody else comes along and says, hey, I saw that you did that thing. Boy, that goes a heck of a long way to building, building, you know, in deer mint. It does. Yeah. And it's all out there for you to know what's going on with these individuals. I mean, today, it's so easy. Everybody's living their lives publicly. So it's easy to see what's going on. But again, be intentional about that research and development that you're doing and what you're seeing. Just don't blindly log in and go through newsfeed. You're going to be doing what the algorithms want you to see. You have to be intentional and look up your network, see what's going out with them. And then don't do it. Don't consider writing on the wall, you know, like a touch. You know, you have to pick up the phone. You need to text them. You get that reach out with them and create a dialogue. And remember Ford, right? Family occupation, recreation and dreams, ask open any questions, right? You know, how's Little Billy doing, right? Or, or he, how's it? How's the new job at, at, you know, Pepsi, whatnot? I just saw you got promoted to direct your finance. How's it going? What, tell me about that. Let them then tell them about you. You know, have learned the art of conversing with individuals, right? Open any conversations. And remember, it's more about them than as you. They're going to give you so much valuable data. And then when they have a need in 16 percent of your network, trans X every single year, when they have a need, they're going to think of their friend, right? And that's you, right? And, and I tell the way, like I love this business because you're in the business of creating friends. Yeah. So get to work. The other thing too, if you're a brand new agent, I've never really heard anyone say this. So I'm curious, you, you might have a different opinion. You might say this is a terrible idea. But my first glance, my first thought is that it's a good idea, but I could be wrong. So if I were a brand new agent, and I had a bunch of friends that owned homes, that maybe weren't even thinking of selling, what every homeowner, or at least what most homeowners who aren't in the process of selling still like to know is what's their place worth. You know, at any given regular day, we can go to Zillow and look at the Zestimate. I don't ever think to do that. But sometimes people do, but you're a real estate professional. You can actually provide most likely a more accurate thing. So what I would do is I would call everybody I know who owns a house if I was new and say, hey, I know you're not looking to buy your cell anytime soon, but I really want to send you a comp because I want to practice and I want to get better at sending comps. Is it okay if I send you what I think your home is currently worth? Just would love to get your review on it. It'll help me in my skill, you know, building my skills. If these are your closest people to you, I think they'd be like, great, send it over. I'm curious what you thought of that. If they're, if, I mean, reaching out to them and asking for a brand new agent, hey, I don't have any clients. I just want to get some practice, you know, running CMAs, that kind of thing. I would run a CMA, but I wouldn't send it to, I wouldn't send it to, I don't think I would send it to, to them. You wouldn't. Okay. No, I wouldn't. I want you to focus more on the relationship building aspect of it. They're going to find out what you're doing through your auto flow, your direct mail, your email marketing, you know, some of the social media, they're going to know what you're doing. Make friends with them first. They're going to ask you about real estate. If they ask you about comps, then you run some comps. Now, you should, what you shouldn't be doing, you should be running comps on homes, you know, but I want to be sending them out. You should be running them, going to your man, you broke, and saying, what do you think about this? I think this home should be priced here based on the comps that I ran. You should be maybe talking to some friends and saying, hey, listen, why don't you come see some open houses with me. I want to go around. I want to get the know of the marketplace. I love a friend to come with me and also, hey, let's go right up, pretend to offer. I'm not going to present it, but let's go take a purchase contract. Let's go get a cup of coffee. I'm going to fill out a contract. I'm going to explain to you a contract. Would you mind me practicing on you? That's what you do with what really good friend of yours. That's going to give you some real life experience, right? But, you know, I'm of the mindset of your touches, your outreach, just should all be relationship. It should be all about them. Real estate will naturally flow to you. I agree. You're right. It's funny. I was talking about putting everyone's anniversaries and birthdays in my calendar. Now, because I do that, especially wedding anniversaries, I routinely get messages from my friends that go, you're the only person outside of my immediate family that knows it's my anniversary. Am I such an amazing guy that I, because I do that? No, I just put it in my calendar. I literally just did the one thing, and how would that make that person feel about me remembering their most special day of their life, right? Or the birth of a child, or whatever it might be, the major life events. If you can somehow be there after the event happens to congratulate the person, boy, that demonstrates a tremendous effort. Absolutely. And that's what it's all about. It's always about them. It's not about you. And it's all about you showing how much you care about them through your actions, even more so than your words. And that's being consistent and continually reaching out to them. Again, the numbers will just take care of it for you. The numbers will just... So, here's a question. But rates are really high right now. I'm an agent. None of my buyers. They're all upset about rates. So, I'm just giving a devil's advocate. What do you say to that? About rates? Okay, great. And you're a buyer? Wonderful. Why are you buying? Because I need more space. Okay. So, the listeners pay close attention to this. Right? It's the why. So, why do you need more space? So that I can work from home a couple days a week. And I need a home office. Why do you want to work from home a couple days a week? So that I can... Because it's more comfortable for me, I don't want to commute in every day. So, I, you know, I'll slide my time. How long do you need it? 30 minutes. So, is that an hour a day then? It's 30 minutes. Yes. You're going to commute in what? In a commuting five days a week then if you're not working from home? Correct. So, that's five hours a day. Right. Right. It's 20 hours a month. Right? So, you know, and take that, that's 240 hours in a year. Yeah. Depended by 24 hours. How many days of that? So, those are the things I ask you, DJ, as my friend and my buyer, you know, what is it to you that's more important? Is it a, say, a six percent interest rate on a 300,000-hour loan, right? Versus maybe drop down to five and a quarter a year from now. So that three quarters of a point difference. What does that come out to? And then you've got to ask yourself, what's more important to you? Five days in the car, 30 minutes each way, or being working from home? I can't answer that. Only you can. My friend buying the home. You make that decision. You tell me if you're wise strong enough for you to buy the home. Right. So, the rates just kind of are what they are. And I think most of our listeners have heard the expression, you know, marry the home date, the rate. It's not an expression. It's an overused expression, but it's it's a pretty good one because it is actually how most people think about purchasing property. They fall in love with the home and whatever the rate is is and people can refinance, of course, thank goodness. So, most agents will ask these questions, DJ, but they don't even have the buyer client yet. They ask if people are building up their building up objections and their heads are already because they've got to do the life flow that's necessary for them to grow their business. Does that tell you a little bit more about life flow? Yeah, life flow is simply touching everybody in your database. I think you do it once a month, right? Personally, by, you know, a text to call, right? Maybe a Facebook messenger to them about them and checking in with them. You know, keeping keeping current with them and keeping them in your life and you in theirs. So, if you have say 300 people in your network, okay, do you have a calculator with you because I don't, I'm pacing. Yes, I do. Okay, great. So, there's there are 20 working days in a month, okay? So, what's 23 divided by, or what's 300 divided by 20? About 15. 15? Yep. 15. You have to make 15 touches a day. 15 touches a day. Now, do that for a full year and a row, followed up with a consistent marketing campaign. Now, take 300 and multiply it by 0.16. I think I'll come to 48. Yeah, 48. That's 48 transactions that are living in that database of 300 people. 16% of them are going to transact. Regardless of the market, they're going to transact. A lot of them might even transact twice. Right. They might sell my mind. Yeah, sell my mind. But here's the reality is maybe 5% or less of real estate agents are actually going to do the activities they need to do and do those 15 touches a day. I've seen the time in and time out. Right. That's that's going to separate you guys from the struggling real estate agent to the very few top producers that are actually out there. And plus like if you really think about it and again, everybody's personalities are different, but I would assume it's a lot more fun to contact somebody and you know, you look to see what they're doing on social. You know, you have a reason to call them. They just did something on social media that you want to acknowledge or there's something going on in the market that you want to make them aware of. Either way, this should all be fun, positive stuff. Right. So making 15 phone calls a day going, yeah, I was just thinking about you. So I you just went on a trip. So you're so and so just got promoted. So you guys just had an anniversary of birthday. Oh, by the way, here's something that's going on in the market that you might care about down the street or whatever. Those are all fun activities. DJ, I would even leave that out of it. Okay. That last part. Okay. I would even leave that part out of it. I would leave bringing it back to real estate out of it. Does that make sense? Yeah, just just connect with them at person. That's that's how I feel just connect with them. Focus on the relationship. Leave anything about your business out of it. They will ask you. Here's how you do it. Okay. DJ, we're in a roleplay here. You're an accountant. Okay. Okay. And say you're an accountant at a big, you know, one of the big five firms. Okay. Okay. DJ, how's business? Well, oh, I'm slammed. It's a kind of it's the beginning of the year. Everyone's working on their taxes. It's brutal right now. I'm slammed. That's crazy. What are you working on? Corporate tax taxes are due. Just clients are asking for everything for just shore up their year. That's crazy years isn't it? Yeah. Now, what are you going to say to me eventually? I'm going to say, Hey, what's going on with you? What's what what are you up to? Right. Now, here's my chance. Just busy running around works crazy. Family's great. How's the market? How's how's the real estate? There you go. Right? Works great. Finally, then you just say, okay, how's the market? Now, I'm not going in every call thinking that through. In fact, I tend to throw scripts away. Right? I just go and make it about the person somehow, usually sometimes that all the time work will pop up. But if I talk to you once a month, I text with you once a month, I send you a Facebook messenger once a month. Two years go by, I'm your buddy. You know what the hell I do for living. And when you are looking to either purchase your home or or or or or sell a home, there's a really strong possibility. I'm the guy you're calling. Why? Because I did my job. I kept you close to me. I kept the relationship with you. Yeah, this is this reminds me of an old Brian Tracy expression and we're not really putting this in the prospecting category. But one of my favorite Brian Tracy quotes is prospecting solve solve problems or sales solve all problems. And of course, of course, he's right. And so what we're really doing is even though we're not prospecting with a capital P, what we're doing is we are prospecting because we are staying in touch with our sphere. We know people are going to choose their real term. Most people are going to choose based on who they know like and trust. You have to earn that. You have to earn no like and trust. So the way that you earn it is exactly how Ryan is describing it here. And if you just do this this year and you you know, you find what 15 phone calls a day if you have 300 people in your database, 15 touches a day, what is that might take what three hours a day? Maybe maybe maybe two hours a day, maybe even less. That is a remarkable low amount of effort for building intimacy. And I'm sorry, not a low in a bad way. That's a very reasonable amount of time to spend. And that will actually result in business. That's absolutely right. And I've seen agents that I'm a very empathetic individual. Don't get me wrong, right? But I've seen agents struggle. And I've seen them complain about it. But then I've also watched them do nothing about it. Yeah. I watch them do nothing about it. Right. And I've watched them look around to say what's going to solve my problem? Guys, there's no silver bullet out there. You got to get to work. You know, look at every professional out there that's successful in any industry. You know, it's so funny. Yeah. You know, again, I worked with a lot of new agents and brought them up. Right. And the first years, a lot of emotional intelligence, I have to work with them on. Right. Because they comment they might be coming to the business in their 40s. Right. And then they're going to look at the friend like, well, he or she's so successful. Like, well, they've been at their career for 20 years. They've been building the career for a long time. Why are you expecting to be a number one agent within 12 months? It makes no sense. And then why if you're seven years of you not doing what you really need to do or you upset that you're you've plateaued and you're really not where you should be? Well, that's because you just gone through time. Like anybody's going to be I think it was Gary color wrote in his book, Marin, millionaire, real estate agent, the Muthusilov fact. You know, who Muthusilized, right? Yes. Right. And so you're going to be in this business for 20 years. Eventually, you're going to have enough business. Just you just want to go through 20 years of being in real estate to finally hit your stride. Right. And there are a lot of agents I know that have been in the business for seven, eight, nine years that are finally hitting the stride. That's just because they've been in it for seven, eight, nine years. Right. You know, it's they're not really probably should be. Yeah, it's it's a really it's a really good point. It's and also it's what's nice about having sort of, you know, your live flow like you were say, would life flow equals connection with your your sphere? What what is so amazing about that is it has nothing to do with the market has nothing to do with the conditions of the economy. It's just interpersonal communication. This is something that that you can do on your best day, your worst day, whatever's going on in your life, you can always pick up the phone, reach out to somebody and and do this regardless of the market conditions or what's going on in in your business. So what's what's wonderful is if you can put the blinders on it does it does it matter if rates are up or down. I mean, of course that affects your client's ability to buy or sell certain things, but you want to always demonstrate care, compassion, you know, and connection. Absolutely. It's always it's I say ABC always be connecting people say it's always be close is always be connecting. Always keep in contact with people and then the sales will just follow you. That's that's a great great thing to end on and a great reminder for all of us that are noticing all of the job cuts that are going on in the real estate world and all of the the just the noise with with of course economists predicting by the way I just went to an NAR conference or saw the NAR chief economist speak Dr. Lawrence Yoon a couple days or last week and and by the way he thinks that the the housing market is going to be just fine. He does not think this will repeat back to 2008 2009 10 etc. So he was he was very excited that things will be returning to normal in the next year or two, but in the meantime and you should be doing this regardless of whether it's a up down up market down market rental market, you know, buy or sell or market connect with your your spear. There's always going to be people like Ryan's at 16% of the people you know are going to transact in the next 24 months. That's just a fact. So how much yeah I'm sorry in the next 12 months 16% will transact in the next 12 months. Some of those will have two transactions. Some will have one. So you have a huge opportunity here, but you have to earn it and the way that you earn it is through as Ryan just said ABC always be connecting. Find out the these things and guys this is the fun part of the job. The hard parts actually working with with the client that's actually the tough part. This is the fun part where you actually get to demonstrate that you care that you you know this is the stuff that you should get excited about because it doesn't require a whole lot of knowledge or skill just requires a little bit of effort and and it requires that you do care about your your clients and if you do care about them demonstrate it and they will they will be with you forever. Well Ryan well I think it's a great place to pause. We are again congratulations on the merger with with cobalt banker that is incredible.
