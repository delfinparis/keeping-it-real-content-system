[00:02:41] great to see you. DJ, it's pleasure to be back. How are you, everything good?
[00:02:46] I think so. I think it's a strange time for us. I think it's a strange time for agents,
[00:02:54] it's a strange time for brokers. I know there's so much in the air. We have the August 17th
[00:03:00] date looming. Coming pretty close, or brokerages at least that I speak to are scrambling to
[00:03:08] ready the agents in making sure that they have something to say on August 18th. What to say,
[00:03:16] and how to present to clients. It's all very interesting. Certainly, we're seeing a lot of
[00:03:23] new stories out there talking about these upcoming changes and what it means for the industry.
[00:03:30] For example, will we see 0% co-op commissions become normalized or not? There's a lot of other
[00:03:38] issues at play too. So, curious to get your thoughts on what's going on in the state of real estate
[00:03:43] right now? Yeah, boy, there's a lot going on. I feel like there's a handful of different topics
[00:03:50] that I feel like are generating conversation, especially among the agents that I spend time with
[00:03:58] and the brokers that I spend time with in this space. Certainly, the NAR stuff continues to be a
[00:04:03] conversation that dominates the passion of many agents because people feel very strongly about it.
[00:04:15] Inventory levels and just the current trajectory of the market, independent of all the NAR
[00:04:21] conversation is also something that's challenging and generating a lot of conversation.
[00:04:30] Then there are other national stories around housing that are putting the wind in the sales of
[00:04:38] the media machine too and generating good conversation, but also some misconceptions that are
[00:04:44] worth talking about. I would love to chat a little bit about that, specifically about some of the
[00:04:51] rent control policies that have been proposed. Yeah, let's start there. Biden has a rent control
[00:04:57] initiative and it hasn't really received as much attention of course with the more serious news that
[00:05:04] has happened on the last several weeks with former President Trump and current President Biden.
[00:05:09] So, I know it's not maybe as as front above the fold maybe on major news sites, but it is
[00:05:16] something that I'm glad we're talking about because I don't hear too many other people talking
[00:05:20] about it. Yeah, so just to get everyone in the know on this, I'm not going to go into all of the
[00:05:28] details because most of them are boring and not really relevant to this conversation. But the big
[00:05:33] headline here is that the Biden administration has proposed a rent control policy that would
[00:05:39] limit the ability of landlords to raise rent by more than 5% per calendar year or since the last
[00:05:49] time rent was raised. So, the goal of this in a vacuum is to create more stability in rent prices,
[00:05:59] such that it cannot be tenants cannot be priced out of apartments with dramatic rent changes.
[00:06:08] And there is precedent for this sort of policy in other areas of housing. For instance, in the
[00:06:19] floor and ceiling to property tax moves, such that property taxes in the state of Michigan,
[00:06:25] where I'm based, can't fluctuate by more than 5% per year regardless of what the appraised value
[00:06:33] of your property is. So, if the market is moving very aggressively, even if your property jumps in value
[00:06:41] by 10% or 20% over the course of a year or two years, your property taxes cannot move more than 5%
[00:06:48] in either direction by 5% for that calendar year. And this is the thought process here is the same.
[00:07:01] But here's why this is a terrible idea and my relatively unpopular opinion. I'm sure I'm going to
[00:07:07] get some crap for this. So, bring it on people. Here's why this is a terrible plan from a rent control
[00:07:14] perspective. If landlords can only raise or hypothetically lower rent by 5% max each year,
[00:07:25] this is going to mean that they have to then use secondary means of tenant evaluation
[00:07:36] in order to get the right tenant into their property. They can't use who can afford this property
[00:07:43] because there's going to be a lot more people who can afford a property if rent can't move
[00:07:48] commiserate to the market. So, that means that landlords are going to have 100 applications
[00:07:54] on apartments when they were only getting 20 before. And if they're getting 100 applications,
[00:08:01] who are they going to choose here based on those 100 applications? They're going to choose the
[00:08:06] people who are absolutely positively the ones who are going to give them the best chance at not
[00:08:13] having a single late rent payment. Thus, rent control is going to benefit the people who likely need
[00:08:22] it the least. In fact, there are stories of rent control happening in states like Alabama, Mississippi,
[00:08:33] Georgia in the south where they have some rent control, but the restrictions are relatively
[00:08:42] unsophisticated. And so landlords can only raise rent by a certain percentage, but there's actually
[00:08:49] no other restrictions put on place. So, they'll get 50 applications for the apartment. They say,
[00:08:54] okay, they essentially turn it into a bidding war for the other terms of the rent contract,
[00:09:04] like I'll pay you all my rent in advance for the entire year. Or I will pay like an optional
[00:09:14] pet deposit that is not a part of the security deposit that is exorbitant. It becomes a Hunger Games
[00:09:21] sort of scenario where the least able to compete become the least helped by rent control. And so
[00:09:32] ultimately, though I understand the Biden administration's heart is in the right place by trying to
[00:09:38] create some normalcy when it comes to rents, especially in major metropolitan markets where they
[00:09:43] can be quite volatile. Instilling rent control is not the solution to the problem.
[00:09:49] Yeah, so basically just to recap the idea is if I'm an investor and I own a apartment building
[00:09:55] and now I am restricted on my rent, my annual rent raise, it to protect the tenants is of course
[00:10:03] the theory of protect them from having to move because maybe I want to increase rents by more than
[00:10:09] 5% to get a different maybe caliber of tenant or I just want to make more money. And obviously
[00:10:16] preventing the tenant from having to find another apartment to live in. When you're right, I have,
[00:10:22] I'll give you an example, I have a, well it creates a lot of unintended consequences,
[00:10:26] but a pretty obvious one you just mentioned, which is increased competition for that rent controlled
[00:10:30] apartment. Yeah, I have a friend in San Francisco and this is not uncommon in San Francisco. The
[00:10:36] stories are probably more common than not where he, I don't know his actual income, but I'll say it's
[00:10:43] north of 300,000 a year somewhere in that category. He has a rent control department that he pays
[00:10:49] like less than $2,000 a month for and it is, you know, it's tiny because it's San Francisco,
[00:10:54] but it normally would go for like 6,000 and he's just gone to locked in and he got that apartment
[00:11:00] because he had a huge income and he was likely to pay and you know, I don't know who he was up
[00:11:07] against, but on paper he looked pretty good. Now, is it really benefiting who it's supposed to
[00:11:12] in his situation? No, not really. He makes enough money to be able to pay more, but of course,
[00:11:19] who would pay more for something if they could pay less? So, you know, the ethics of that is not
[00:11:24] what I'm debating, just the reality is people are going to gravitate towards that. So increased
[00:11:28] competition is going to create an issue. I wonder if there's, if there is a solution to that,
[00:11:35] where you could still, you know, put a cap on them without that unintended consequence of
[00:11:42] increased competition. I'll tell you what, there is a clear solution to this problem and it is
[00:11:48] rent control in the form of inventory control. If we put in place and this is not something that
[00:11:56] can be done at the federal level, frankly, this is a local decision that could be supported by state
[00:12:02] and federal programs to help mandate things into the right direction. If we absolutely
[00:12:09] tore the roof off the housing density restrictions in the communities where we need housing the most,
[00:12:17] we would put in place de facto rent control by virtue of balancing the inventory on the market.
[00:12:25] There is, I mean, it is simple economics and if you've been in the real estate space for
[00:12:30] longer than eight seconds, you understand when there are lots of choices on the market,
[00:12:36] prices tend to go down. It is just the reality of supply and demand economics. Now, of course,
[00:12:42] there's going to be hooks and and ladders that that wind up creating temporary artificial
[00:12:48] imbalances in any community. But generally speaking, if you have a hundred people looking for
[00:12:55] apartments and only three to choose from, it doesn't matter what restrictions you apply to this
[00:13:05] market to bring rent down. You are not solving the problem. You do solve the problem by creating
[00:13:14] inventory kind of local markets that incentivize either the building of new units or the
[00:13:23] subdividing of existing units such that we create more inventory for people to choose from.
[00:13:30] Because frankly, the opposite argument here is that we just need less people to live in our areas.
[00:13:39] And if you ask any politician, if you ask any community member with some common sense,
[00:13:46] the idea of your community shrinking is not commiserate with the idea of your community's
[00:13:52] prosperous, being prosperous. A shrinking community is not a prosperous community. These things
[00:13:59] are they don't line up. So if you want to solve for this, solve for it by putting policies in place
[00:14:07] that encourage new inventory, not rent control on the existing inventory.
[00:14:12] So let the free market work assuming that developers are allowed to build where they want
[00:14:21] in those communities that need the service the most.
[00:14:24] Yeah, I would say that that's true, but I mean, it's not even free market. I mean, there is some of
[00:14:28] that. But like think about it like this. And if you're watching me on video, you're going to see me
[00:14:33] visualize this with my hands. The rent control is like putting a downward pressure on prices
[00:14:42] in order to try and get people closer to rent that they can afford. That is that's a market
[00:14:53] control. I'm actually proposing a different market control, which is upward pressure on the
[00:14:59] amount of inventory. We should be putting policies in place that are goosing the building or
[00:15:06] restructuring over the existing inventory to provide more people with opportunities and choices.
[00:15:12] That's that is also a market control. I am not advocating for pure free market
[00:15:19] real estate here because frankly, we don't that would be chaos in a lot of markets. I mean,
[00:15:25] you would be you would see people I'm not exaggerating that you would see city parks
[00:15:30] being put up for sale to the highest bidder because I mean, there's a whole bunch of land here.
[00:15:37] We don't need swing sets here. We need apartment buildings. That's not what I'm advocating. I'm
[00:15:41] advocating for common sense solutions that provide for policies in place with our existing
[00:15:48] infrastructure to get more units. And it can even be like here's a great example of one. We can
[00:15:55] provide housing in like city suburbs, loosen the restrictions on building in certain suburbs,
[00:16:04] and then increase the investment in public transportation from that suburb into the city center.
[00:16:10] These are market flexes. And the bad news is these don't take three months to fix things. They
[00:16:16] take three years or 30 years to fix things. But we're living in a society here, people. This is a
[00:16:23] systemic issue that is not going to be fixed in three months. We need to be committed to the long
[00:16:28] term here because you're going to live here in three years. Don't you want it to be good even
[00:16:33] if it takes that long? Right. Yeah, that's a really strong point. Speaking of inventory, I know you
[00:16:41] had some thoughts about the current state of a home inventory. So just purchase and sale inventory.
[00:16:48] Tell us sort of where we're at and what that means currently. Yeah, CoreLogic recently released
[00:16:55] some stats for the month of May into June that the average American market is sitting on around
[00:17:02] three and a half months of home inventory. And if you're not familiar with this measure, inventory
[00:17:09] is home inventory by months is measured by looking at the current demand for for property
[00:17:19] and for homes and saying if no inventory, if no new property were added to the current
[00:17:26] market, how long would it take us to sell through what we currently have based on the current
[00:17:32] demand? And so a healthy balanced market is about six months of inventory. We are currently sitting
[00:17:40] at around three and a half months of inventory. So clearly we are in a seller's market. There's more
[00:17:45] demand for for homes than we have supply. And once you get past three months of inventory, you move
[00:17:54] into unhealthy territory. Once you get down into the three three months two and a half months,
[00:18:01] two months of inventory, those are, they can be fun times if you are representing sellers
[00:18:09] because you get like, I mean, remember, like following COVID, this was following COVID, we saw
[00:18:16] inventory levels of less than two months. And you put a property on the market and you'd get
[00:18:21] six offers before even you had your first showing. It was kind of fun from a like,
[00:18:26] you know, like a Martin Scorsese kind of movie perspective, but this isn't the real world. This
[00:18:33] is, I mean, it's fun for one person and a nightmare for the rest of us. We are currently
[00:18:39] tottering on this like sellers market, even an unhealthy sellers market. And there's some
[00:18:46] interesting takeaways here, including some of the strategies that that real estate professionals
[00:18:52] can start to implement in their business for the remainder of this year. You know, we're moving
[00:18:57] into the second half of the year. What do you do with this information? So lots of cool things to
[00:19:01] kind of talk through here. Yeah, I'd let's let's let's talk about that. So low inventory, we know,
[00:19:10] of course, drives prices up. We've seen rates kind of basically stay kind of where they're in
[00:19:18] the low sevens at this point, I think, as of today and this summer, it's been right right around
[00:19:24] there. So a lot of buyers who are maybe still sitting on the fence waiting for rates to come down,
[00:19:30] but more importantly, just not seeing the inventory to be able to put offers in. So if I'm an agent
[00:19:37] and I am working with a buyer right now and we're dealing with this, geez, I just every time we go
[00:19:46] to look for something it gets taken, you know, what might I be talking to my buyers about to sort
[00:19:51] of prepare them for, you know, this, this, you know, inventory crunch and what can they do to sort
[00:20:00] of stay ahead of that curve, I guess. Yeah, for sure. So there's a couple of things I would say here.
[00:20:05] And this is, I'm going to share a little on popular, I guess. If you are a buyer's agent right now,
[00:20:14] I'm going to tell you the script right now that you need to use if you want to be successful in
[00:20:20] this market. And I'm going to dovetail this conversation with, with the conversations that agents
[00:20:29] are having across the country around the NAR lawsuit settlement stuff. Right now, real estate agents,
[00:20:36] especially buyers representatives are being forced to demonstrate their value in order to justify
[00:20:44] their commission. There is a, you know, almost literal thing for your supper scenario happening here.
[00:20:52] And you can use this as an advantage when talking through a buyer strategy right now. And here's
[00:21:02] what you do. You say talking to your buyer, Mr. Mrs. Buyer. Am I the first real estate agent you've
[00:21:11] worked with in your life? If they're not first time home buyers, they're obviously going to say,
[00:21:17] no, I've worked with somebody before. You say, okay. In your previous experience, has there been
[00:21:24] times when you said, when you were interested in a home, but you just couldn't get in on time,
[00:21:30] you didn't get a chance to see it. You didn't know about it until it was under contract.
[00:21:35] If they've bought or sold a home in the last 10 years, the answer's almost certainly going to be yes.
[00:21:41] So here's what you do. You take that information and you say, listen,
[00:21:46] there's no, it's no secret. Real estate commissions have been on the news lately. It is up to buyer's
[00:21:52] agents to clearly demonstrate their value to their clients in order to have good conversations
[00:21:57] around how much money I make as your representative. I can tell you this. Right now, we have ex months
[00:22:07] of inventory in our market. This means that we're going to feel really competitive. There's going
[00:22:11] to be a lot of people out there. I'm going to be biasing my strategy towards getting you into
[00:22:17] the homes that you want to see before as many other people as possible. In fact, I want to get you
[00:22:23] into things before they even hit the market. I want to get you into things the second they go live.
[00:22:29] I am going to prove my value to you not just by my advice, but by my access. I'm going to prove my
[00:22:39] value to you not just by my experience, but by my ability to position you timing wise in a competitive
[00:22:51] market such that you can provide the best offer before other people even have a chance to make theirs.
[00:22:59] In short, if you have buyers who are asking you, how are we going to be successful and at the same
[00:23:07] time they're going to say, oh, and by the way, how much are you getting paid and do I have to pay
[00:23:11] you this? And are you really worth that much to say yourself, you remember that last buyer experience
[00:23:17] you had, that's not going to happen with me. And if it does happen with me, clearly I'm not worth
[00:23:22] this money. But since it won't, I am. And you can inner link your understanding of a tight market
[00:23:29] with low inventory and these low inventory numbers with your value as an agent and get people to
[00:23:34] the closing table faster. Is this like a kumbaya strategy? No, you are pitting yourself against the
[00:23:42] other agents in your market and saying, listen, these suckers aren't going to get you in there
[00:23:47] faster. I'm going to get you in there. I know the people who are going to get you in there faster.
[00:23:52] This is unlikely to have you win the miscongeniality award at your association banquet in November.
[00:24:02] But play by the rules and don't be mean to people, but don't be afraid to get aggressive. That's
[00:24:12] just a little bit deeper into this. So I really love that script and I hope our listeners can go
[00:24:18] back. And by the way, we provide transcriptions for all of our episodes. If you can't find them,
[00:24:25] reach out to us. I think they should be within the episode you can usually find it. But Chris
[00:24:29] Grave, a great script there. And my follow up question as the buyer to the buyer's agent to that
[00:24:36] script would say, great, I'd love to know specifically, how are you going to get me access to those
[00:24:42] properties first? How am I going to be first in line? Can you tell me a little bit about that strategy?
[00:24:48] Well, so there are a handful of things. If the buyer asks me this, that I am going to say the
[00:24:55] first thing I'm going to say is I'm plugged into X number of agent networks that are going to get
[00:25:05] me information before it hits the MLS and before it hits Zillow. Here's some good examples of this.
[00:25:10] Women's Council of REALTORS is a closed group that if you are not a part of, you are missing out.
[00:25:17] Another one is all brokerages that I have ever been a part of have early coming soon meetings.
[00:25:26] Like they have halves and needs meetings on a weekly basis. If you don't have one of these going,
[00:25:32] you should start one in your brokerage. And if you don't have one of these going in your brokerage,
[00:25:37] you should be considering other brokerages, frankly. But the halves and needs meeting, you can
[00:25:42] emphasize this with your clients. The other thing that you can be thoughtful and emphasizing about
[00:25:48] or thoughtful and emphasizing is your connection to the preferred vendors that you work with
[00:25:58] within the industry. And start a conversation with these folks on a weekly basis. Here's a great
[00:26:04] example of this. I have in my local market a preferred inspector, a preferred appraiser, a preferred
[00:26:12] home renovation specialist. I have house cleaners, I have mortgage professionals, I have
[00:26:16] title companies. When I was working full time in this space, I had a weekly email that would go
[00:26:22] to these folks. And for some of them that I had good relationships with, like near friendship
[00:26:28] relationships with, these would be text messages. They would know on Monday, they're going to hear
[00:26:32] from Chris, hey, I've got ex clients that are looking for A, B and C right now. Have you heard
[00:26:39] anything that you think that would indicate you've got how that our houses are coming? I cannot
[00:26:44] tell you how many times the home cleaners and the home renovators text from me back. Oh yeah,
[00:26:51] you know, I just cleaned the house of over on 123 Main Street. They mentioned that they were
[00:26:57] getting ready to list the property for sale. It does not take rocket science to do this on a weekly
[00:27:05] basis. And in fact, once you establish this sort of regular routine, these folks reach out to you.
[00:27:11] Right. And then, like I'm not compensating them for the individual referrals, that's illegal.
[00:27:21] But what I am doing is on a quarterly and then just a spontaneous basis. I'm shooting them a gift card
[00:27:27] to downtown Trevor City. I'm getting them a, you know, a restaurant, you know, a
[00:27:32] binom lunch at x, y and z. I'm building relationships by the, by means of incentivizing good communication.
[00:27:39] It works, guys. It doesn't take, it doesn't happen overnight, but it works. Yeah, I know a lot of
[00:27:46] agents. So for anyone out there that's sorry, interrupted myself, I was going to say for agents that
[00:27:52] have done successful transactions with other broker, other agents at other firms, this is a great time
[00:27:58] to reach out and reconnect with those agents, say, hey, I just wanted to touch base. I felt like we
[00:28:03] did a great job on x, y, z property. And just so you know, I have really motivated buyers right now.
[00:28:09] So if you ever have something coming down the pike, you know, feel free to let me know about it. And
[00:28:15] I would be, you know, honored to, you know, to give you feedback and present this first to my clients.
[00:28:21] So you're right. I think it's a proactive play. You have to reach out to, in your case, the vendor
[00:28:27] example was a great one because I wasn't totally sure where you were going to go with that. I was
[00:28:31] like, how are the vendors going to know, oh, well, of course, they work on properties. They are
[00:28:34] going to know things like that. So that's, that's a great, a divorce attorneys, another, another great
[00:28:40] one. Oh, yeah, absolutely. I mean, it's unfortunate, but, but technically a good source of, of
[00:28:46] home need people with, with those needs. So I think that's right. So that's an interesting
[00:28:53] play. The hey, Mr and Mrs. buyer, you know, here's what, here's how it used to work with respect to,
[00:29:02] you know, finding a property, paying your agent, you know, going through really the explanation
[00:29:07] of compensation, but also services, right? You really talked about, you know, in the past buyers,
[00:29:13] buyer agents didn't have to do too much to, to, you know, collect a check. I mean, it's, it's not
[00:29:19] that they didn't work hard. Of course, they work hard. I'm sorry, I should have, I misspoke. They
[00:29:23] didn't have to do much explaining to the client to be able to collect the check at the end of that
[00:29:28] successful transaction. And they should have, but they didn't, you know, they didn't. And so here,
[00:29:33] here we are. But now we have this opportunity, and you've been saying this for months and months,
[00:29:38] to really distinguish ourselves as an agent, why are we getting paid, you know, x percent? Well,
[00:29:44] and now I think it may be a bit uncomfortable to have those conversations with buyers, but only
[00:29:50] really because the fear of the unknown and doing something new and having the buyer say,
[00:29:55] I don't want to pay that, right? Yes, those, those are challenges. And there's hopefully going to be
[00:30:00] some solutions. I don't know who's, if anyone can come to the rescue there, perhaps maybe a lender,
[00:30:06] one day will figure out a way to load a commission into, into a purchase. But for now, you can at
[00:30:13] least say, here's why I charge what I charge. And here's what I'm actually going to do. And then,
[00:30:18] of course, you have to do it, which is the hardest part. But I think that's a very interesting idea.
[00:30:24] So, you know, years ago, we used to say clients don't need, need the buyer's agent to allow
[00:30:28] to find a property because, you know, there's access to that everywhere. And there still is access
[00:30:34] to that everywhere. And so now you really have to dive into those private listing networks or,
[00:30:40] you know, other brokerages, if you don't have one that does have a coming soon, kind of,
[00:30:46] inventory pool. And really just connecting with those agents who you know get deals closed.
[00:30:51] And saying, hey, let's work together here. You know, you have, you know, I'll send, you know,
[00:30:56] I'll let you know when I've got something advice for us. And then those vendor partners, I love that,
[00:31:00] that, you know, sending, sending them business, of course, as well, like making sure that they know
[00:31:05] specifically what you need and how you can service their clients and make them look good.
[00:31:09] Yep, 100%. And, you know, on that, you mentioned something that I know, it wasn't on our agenda to talk
[00:31:15] about. But I did want to tell you, on the note of a lender rolling, you know, finding a way to
[00:31:22] roll commissions into loans. I'm starting to hear whispers of lenders who aren't doing that because
[00:31:30] it's just the commissions, the mortgage finance system in the United States with our current
[00:31:38] restrictions regulations. It's just a lot of people are trying, it's just aren't ways to kind
[00:31:44] of diesel in the commission. But what I am seeing is some bankers really, I was really interesting.
[00:31:50] I applaud this. The idea of partnering a mortgage loan with a personal loan, the personal
[00:31:58] loan is for paying the commission and using the home, like the property purchase as collateral
[00:32:08] for the personal loan to you are essentially creating, it's like a mini second mortgage,
[00:32:16] but it's not called a mini second mortgage. It's not, yeah, it serves functionally the same,
[00:32:24] but it's still a little sticky because, you know, you're trying to get a loan on a property you
[00:32:29] don't actually own yet as collateral. So there's a lot of really interesting conversation that
[00:32:34] happened around this. I'm glad I'm not a mortgage broker right now. The opportunity for innovation
[00:32:41] is huge. I'm just glad someone else was doing that. One final question for you and this is just
[00:32:47] a prediction and understanding that, you know, you may or may not have the crystal ball
[00:32:54] accurately or clear on this one because I've talked to a lot of different people who have a lot of
[00:32:59] different answers to this. Do you suspect this fall we start to see 0% co-ops? And if, I mean,
[00:33:09] you technically have started to see them a bit now, will that become more normalized in the next,
[00:33:16] let's just say 12 months or curious to get just to get your thoughts on what your prediction is.
[00:33:21] Yeah. So I think the answer to that is yes, but it's by sector of the real estate market.
[00:33:32] This is not going to be, I'm going to get so much crap for saying this. I'm sorry, in advance to
[00:33:38] people who love and care about me and have to read this stuff. But I mean, here's the reality.
[00:33:44] Poor people are going to be affected much more substantially by this move than rich people.
[00:33:52] And what I mean by this is we are going to see 0% co-ops on the low end of the market. We are
[00:34:09] going to see that. Those folks are going to opt for a 0% co-op commission on the sale of their
[00:34:17] $200,000 home because that's $6,000 right there. If you're dividing up a traditional 6% commission rate,
[00:34:27] that 3% means a lot to them. And again, for better or worse, if you are buying a home that is $200,000,
[00:34:37] you're likely to be able to put the bill for that commission rate is lower. It's just statistically
[00:34:47] is lower. Folks who are buying $200,000 homes, but more than 50% of them couldn't weather more than 45 days
[00:34:58] unemployed, let alone have an extra $6,000 sitting around for their real estate commission.
[00:35:05] So the answer is yes, we are going to see this and consumers are going to become empowered
[00:35:14] by this settlement at the low end of the market to find opportunities to save money where they can.
[00:35:20] But it will be to their own market detriment, I'm sorry to say. One thing I do want to throw out here
[00:35:28] though is in the higher ends of the market, I think we are much less likely to see this. And in
[00:35:36] the luxury end of the market, I think it will be almost never will we see this. And I will speak
[00:35:46] very briefly on the fact that I spent all week last week in Los Angeles at an event that my team
[00:35:54] at luxury presence put on for the top 1% of real estate professionals in the entire country. I
[00:36:00] had a chance to speak with dozens of extraordinarily high performing real estate professionals, many of
[00:36:07] whom I'm not going to name names here, but many of whom appear on Bravo and Netflix and all the
[00:36:14] different places where you glamorize and romanticize the life of a real estate agent. A lot of these
[00:36:21] folks are already telling me we've been having these conversations with our clients for years,
[00:36:27] for literally for years. We prove to them how much we are worth at the first conversation. And
[00:36:34] there is an understanding that we are working, we are demonstrating this value. And there is a
[00:36:43] like a financial literacy on the part of the buyers in those situations and sellers to realize,
[00:36:49] yeah, I'm stroking the check for the buyers commission relative to the way that the proceeds
[00:36:56] shake out. But it's the buyer who's bringing the funds to the table in order to actually secure
[00:37:02] the property. So I think it will happen more frequently on the low end. It'll happen less frequently
[00:37:09] as the prices go up. And once you get North for a million dollars, I doubt you'll see it at all.
[00:37:15] Yeah, I agree. It certainly just makes logical sense. And so that does impact people purchasing and
[00:37:24] selling with lower price properties disproportionately. And you're right, you do have sellers that are
[00:37:31] going to say, I'd like to keep that $6,000. And let's just throw it up and see what happens. Maybe
[00:37:36] we will get somebody who's willing to do it. And so I think it'll be a lot of like, hey, let's just
[00:37:42] give it a shot. And I think, well, we'll see. I hope that I hope that, well, I don't know what
[00:37:49] I hope for. I guess we'll see. We'll see what happens. But anyway, Chris, let's wrap up with your
[00:37:54] speaking schedule. Do you have any upcoming events that people should be aware of? Yeah, I sure do.
[00:38:00] Actually, let's see here. If you are a REALTOR in Alberta, Canada, I will be at
[00:38:13] an event in Edmonton, the week of September 16, 17th and 18th. And boy, I wish I had the name of
[00:38:22] that event right on the top of my head, but I do not. So if you're in Canada, first of all,
[00:38:28] you know, hello, a glad to see you. And you probably know what I'm talking about here. I can't
[00:38:35] recall the name of the event, but if you're in Canada, if you're in Edmonton, I'd love to see you.
[00:38:39] If you are heading to the NAR conference in Boston this November, I will be a featured speaker
[00:38:45] there. If you are a REALTOR in New York, New Jersey or Pennsylvania, I will be in at Triple Play
[00:38:53] in Atlantic City this December. And there's a couple of other things that are kind of cooking along
[00:38:57] the way, but those are the big ones. So I'd love to see you. And of course, you can find me on
[00:39:01] social media. Go to LinkedIn, search me there, go to Instagram, you can go to Threads.
[00:39:06] I'm not really on Facebook unless you want to see pictures of what I do every weekend,
[00:39:11] you know, at the farmers market, which is kind of boring. So don't follow me on Facebook.
[00:39:14] But follow me on Instagram and LinkedIn. I'd love to chat with you there.
[00:39:18] ChrisLidsel.com is the place to go to follow Chris and all of his thoughts and his schedule as well.
[00:39:24] And he is eligible, he is able or available rather to speak at your conference or brokerage or
[00:39:33] a state event. So please consider him. He speaks all over the all over the country every single year.
[00:39:39] And he's one of the more sought after speakers in this industry. And he just knows a lot. And he's
[00:39:43] really a dynamic and fun speaker as you know, from the show. So ChrisLidsel.com, please reach out to
[00:39:48] him. And also if you're a luxury presence client, definitely reach out to him, let him know what you
[00:39:53] think of of luxury presence, which of course is we've had we've had your CEO on multi's been on
[00:39:59] our show, which was all really fun episode is a neat guy. Anyway, Chris, another great episode.
[00:40:04] Thank you to Chris from all of our listeners for coming on year after year, month after month,
[00:40:09] and really sharing some good, solid, timely information about the market and technology too.
[00:40:16] I know we didn't get too much into tech this month, but we'll maybe hit that next month.
[00:40:20] And also on behalf of Kristen, myself, thanks to the audience for sticking around to the end.
[00:40:25] By the way, just as a quick aside, and I don't know why this happened, but we had our best month
[00:40:29] ever last month. We were up about 40% in downloads, which was substantial for us. So we are doing well.
[00:40:39] So I don't know if everyone's telling a friend or we just got lucky. Either way, thank you for
[00:40:44] everyone that listened and please tell a friend that will really help us continue to grow. We're so
[00:40:49] grateful to our sponsors and to everyone who listens to this show. We'll see everybody on the
[00:40:53] next episode. Thank you, Chris. DJ, it was a pleasure. So glad to be with you. Thanks everybody for
[00:40:59] listening and for your support.

How are you, everything good? I think so. I think it's a strange time for us. I think it's a strange time for agents, it's a strange time for brokers. I know there's so much in the air. We have the August 17th date looming. Coming pretty close, or brokerages at least that I speak to are scrambling to ready the agents in making sure that they have something to say on August 18th. What to say, and how to present to clients. It's all very interesting. Certainly, we're seeing a lot of new stories out there talking about these upcoming changes and what it means for the industry. For example, will we see 0% co-op commissions become normalized or not? There's a lot of other issues at play too. So, curious to get your thoughts on what's going on in the state of real estate right now? Yeah, boy, there's a lot going on. I feel like there's a handful of different topics that I feel like are generating conversation, especially among the agents that I spend time with and the brokers that I spend time with in this space. Certainly, the NAR stuff continues to be a conversation that dominates the passion of many agents because people feel very strongly about it. Inventory levels and just the current trajectory of the market, independent of all the NAR conversation is also something that's challenging and generating a lot of conversation. Then there are other national stories around housing that are putting the wind in the sales of the media machine too and generating good conversation, but also some misconceptions that are worth talking about. I would love to chat a little bit about that, specifically about some of the rent control policies that have been proposed. Yeah, let's start there. Biden has a rent control initiative and it hasn't really received as much attention of course with the more serious news that has happened on the last several weeks with former President Trump and current President Biden. So, I know it's not maybe as as front above the fold maybe on major news sites, but it is something that I'm glad we're talking about because I don't hear too many other people talking about it. Yeah, so just to get everyone in the know on this, I'm not going to go into all of the details because most of them are boring and not really relevant to this conversation. But the big headline here is that the Biden administration has proposed a rent control policy that would limit the ability of landlords to raise rent by more than 5% per calendar year or since the last time rent was raised. So, the goal of this in a vacuum is to create more stability in rent prices, such that it cannot be tenants cannot be priced out of apartments with dramatic rent changes. And there is precedent for this sort of policy in other areas of housing. For instance, in the floor and ceiling to property tax moves, such that property taxes in the state of Michigan, where I'm based, can't fluctuate by more than 5% per year regardless of what the appraised value of your property is. So, if the market is moving very aggressively, even if your property jumps in value by 10% or 20% over the course of a year or two years, your property taxes cannot move more than 5% in either direction by 5% for that calendar year. And this is the thought process here is the same. But here's why this is a terrible idea and my relatively unpopular opinion. I'm sure I'm going to get some crap for this. So, bring it on people. Here's why this is a terrible plan from a rent control perspective. If landlords can only raise or hypothetically lower rent by 5% max each year, this is going to mean that they have to then use secondary means of tenant evaluation in order to get the right tenant into their property. They can't use who can afford this property because there's going to be a lot more people who can afford a property if rent can't move commiserate to the market. So, that means that landlords are going to have 100 applications on apartments when they were only getting 20 before. And if they're getting 100 applications, who are they going to choose here based on those 100 applications? They're going to choose the people who are absolutely positively the ones who are going to give them the best chance at not having a single late rent payment. Thus, rent control is going to benefit the people who likely need it the least. In fact, there are stories of rent control happening in states like Alabama, Mississippi, Georgia in the south where they have some rent control, but the restrictions are relatively unsophisticated. And so landlords can only raise rent by a certain percentage, but there's actually no other restrictions put on place. So, they'll get 50 applications for the apartment. They say, okay, they essentially turn it into a bidding war for the other terms of the rent contract, like I'll pay you all my rent in advance for the entire year. Or I will pay like an optional pet deposit that is not a part of the security deposit that is exorbitant. It becomes a Hunger Games sort of scenario where the least able to compete become the least helped by rent control. And so ultimately, though I understand the Biden administration's heart is in the right place by trying to create some normalcy when it comes to rents, especially in major metropolitan markets where they can be quite volatile. Instilling rent control is not the solution to the problem. Yeah, so basically just to recap the idea is if I'm an investor and I own a apartment building and now I am restricted on my rent, my annual rent raise, it to protect the tenants is of course the theory of protect them from having to move because maybe I want to increase rents by more than 5% to get a different maybe caliber of tenant or I just want to make more money. And obviously preventing the tenant from having to find another apartment to live in. When you're right, I have, I'll give you an example, I have a, well it creates a lot of unintended consequences, but a pretty obvious one you just mentioned, which is increased competition for that rent controlled apartment. Yeah, I have a friend in San Francisco and this is not uncommon in San Francisco. The stories are probably more common than not where he, I don't know his actual income, but I'll say it's north of 300,000 a year somewhere in that category. He has a rent control department that he pays like less than $2,000 a month for and it is, you know, it's tiny because it's San Francisco, but it normally would go for like 6,000 and he's just gone to locked in and he got that apartment because he had a huge income and he was likely to pay and you know, I don't know who he was up against, but on paper he looked pretty good. Now, is it really benefiting who it's supposed to in his situation? No, not really. He makes enough money to be able to pay more, but of course, who would pay more for something if they could pay less? So, you know, the ethics of that is not what I'm debating, just the reality is people are going to gravitate towards that. So increased competition is going to create an issue. I wonder if there's, if there is a solution to that, where you could still, you know, put a cap on them without that unintended consequence of increased competition. I'll tell you what, there is a clear solution to this problem and it is rent control in the form of inventory control. If we put in place and this is not something that can be done at the federal level, frankly, this is a local decision that could be supported by state and federal programs to help mandate things into the right direction. If we absolutely tore the roof off the housing density restrictions in the communities where we need housing the most, we would put in place de facto rent control by virtue of balancing the inventory on the market. There is, I mean, it is simple economics and if you've been in the real estate space for longer than eight seconds, you understand when there are lots of choices on the market, prices tend to go down. It is just the reality of supply and demand economics. Now, of course, there's going to be hooks and and ladders that that wind up creating temporary artificial imbalances in any community. But generally speaking, if you have a hundred people looking for apartments and only three to choose from, it doesn't matter what restrictions you apply to this market to bring rent down. You are not solving the problem. You do solve the problem by creating inventory kind of local markets that incentivize either the building of new units or the subdividing of existing units such that we create more inventory for people to choose from. Because frankly, the opposite argument here is that we just need less people to live in our areas. And if you ask any politician, if you ask any community member with some common sense, the idea of your community shrinking is not commiserate with the idea of your community's prosperous, being prosperous. A shrinking community is not a prosperous community. These things are they don't line up. So if you want to solve for this, solve for it by putting policies in place that encourage new inventory, not rent control on the existing inventory. So let the free market work assuming that developers are allowed to build where they want in those communities that need the service the most. Yeah, I would say that that's true, but I mean, it's not even free market. I mean, there is some of that. But like think about it like this. And if you're watching me on video, you're going to see me visualize this with my hands. The rent control is like putting a downward pressure on prices in order to try and get people closer to rent that they can afford. That is that's a market control. I'm actually proposing a different market control, which is upward pressure on the amount of inventory. We should be putting policies in place that are goosing the building or restructuring over the existing inventory to provide more people with opportunities and choices. That's that is also a market control. I am not advocating for pure free market real estate here because frankly, we don't that would be chaos in a lot of markets. I mean, you would be you would see people I'm not exaggerating that you would see city parks being put up for sale to the highest bidder because I mean, there's a whole bunch of land here. We don't need swing sets here. We need apartment buildings. That's not what I'm advocating. I'm advocating for common sense solutions that provide for policies in place with our existing infrastructure to get more units. And it can even be like here's a great example of one. We can provide housing in like city suburbs, loosen the restrictions on building in certain suburbs, and then increase the investment in public transportation from that suburb into the city center. These are market flexes. And the bad news is these don't take three months to fix things. They take three years or 30 years to fix things. But we're living in a society here, people. This is a systemic issue that is not going to be fixed in three months. We need to be committed to the long term here because you're going to live here in three years. Don't you want it to be good even if it takes that long? Right. Yeah, that's a really strong point. Speaking of inventory, I know you had some thoughts about the current state of a home inventory. So just purchase and sale inventory. Tell us sort of where we're at and what that means currently. Yeah, CoreLogic recently released some stats for the month of May into June that the average American market is sitting on around three and a half months of home inventory. And if you're not familiar with this measure, inventory is home inventory by months is measured by looking at the current demand for for property and for homes and saying if no inventory, if no new property were added to the current market, how long would it take us to sell through what we currently have based on the current demand? And so a healthy balanced market is about six months of inventory. We are currently sitting at around three and a half months of inventory. So clearly we are in a seller's market. There's more demand for for homes than we have supply. And once you get past three months of inventory, you move into unhealthy territory. Once you get down into the three three months two and a half months, two months of inventory, those are, they can be fun times if you are representing sellers because you get like, I mean, remember, like following COVID, this was following COVID, we saw inventory levels of less than two months. And you put a property on the market and you'd get six offers before even you had your first showing. It was kind of fun from a like, you know, like a Martin Scorsese kind of movie perspective, but this isn't the real world. This is, I mean, it's fun for one person and a nightmare for the rest of us. We are currently tottering on this like sellers market, even an unhealthy sellers market. And there's some interesting takeaways here, including some of the strategies that that real estate professionals can start to implement in their business for the remainder of this year. You know, we're moving into the second half of the year. What do you do with this information? So lots of cool things to kind of talk through here. Yeah, I'd let's let's let's talk about that. So low inventory, we know, of course, drives prices up. We've seen rates kind of basically stay kind of where they're in the low sevens at this point, I think, as of today and this summer, it's been right right around there. So a lot of buyers who are maybe still sitting on the fence waiting for rates to come down, but more importantly, just not seeing the inventory to be able to put offers in. So if I'm an agent and I am working with a buyer right now and we're dealing with this, geez, I just every time we go to look for something it gets taken, you know, what might I be talking to my buyers about to sort of prepare them for, you know, this, this, you know, inventory crunch and what can they do to sort of stay ahead of that curve, I guess. Yeah, for sure. So there's a couple of things I would say here. And this is, I'm going to share a little on popular, I guess. If you are a buyer's agent right now, I'm going to tell you the script right now that you need to use if you want to be successful in this market. And I'm going to dovetail this conversation with, with the conversations that agents are having across the country around the NAR lawsuit settlement stuff. Right now, real estate agents, especially buyers representatives are being forced to demonstrate their value in order to justify their commission. There is a, you know, almost literal thing for your supper scenario happening here. And you can use this as an advantage when talking through a buyer strategy right now. And here's what you do. You say talking to your buyer, Mr. Mrs. Buyer. Am I the first real estate agent you've worked with in your life? If they're not first time home buyers, they're obviously going to say, no, I've worked with somebody before. You say, okay. In your previous experience, has there been times when you said, when you were interested in a home, but you just couldn't get in on time, you didn't get a chance to see it. You didn't know about it until it was under contract. If they've bought or sold a home in the last 10 years, the answer's almost certainly going to be yes. So here's what you do. You take that information and you say, listen, there's no, it's no secret. Real estate commissions have been on the news lately. It is up to buyer's agents to clearly demonstrate their value to their clients in order to have good conversations around how much money I make as your representative. I can tell you this. Right now, we have ex months of inventory in our market. This means that we're going to feel really competitive. There's going to be a lot of people out there. I'm going to be biasing my strategy towards getting you into the homes that you want to see before as many other people as possible. In fact, I want to get you into things before they even hit the market. I want to get you into things the second they go live. I am going to prove my value to you not just by my advice, but by my access. I'm going to prove my value to you not just by my experience, but by my ability to position you timing wise in a competitive market such that you can provide the best offer before other people even have a chance to make theirs. In short, if you have buyers who are asking you, how are we going to be successful and at the same time they're going to say, oh, and by the way, how much are you getting paid and do I have to pay you this? And are you really worth that much to say yourself, you remember that last buyer experience you had, that's not going to happen with me. And if it does happen with me, clearly I'm not worth this money. But since it won't, I am. And you can inner link your understanding of a tight market with low inventory and these low inventory numbers with your value as an agent and get people to the closing table faster. Is this like a kumbaya strategy? No, you are pitting yourself against the other agents in your market and saying, listen, these suckers aren't going to get you in there faster. I'm going to get you in there. I know the people who are going to get you in there faster. This is unlikely to have you win the miscongeniality award at your association banquet in November. But play by the rules and don't be mean to people, but don't be afraid to get aggressive. That's just a little bit deeper into this. So I really love that script and I hope our listeners can go back. And by the way, we provide transcriptions for all of our episodes. If you can't find them, reach out to us. I think they should be within the episode you can usually find it. But Chris Grave, a great script there. And my follow up question as the buyer to the buyer's agent to that script would say, great, I'd love to know specifically, how are you going to get me access to those properties first? How am I going to be first in line? Can you tell me a little bit about that strategy? Well, so there are a handful of things. If the buyer asks me this, that I am going to say the first thing I'm going to say is I'm plugged into X number of agent networks that are going to get me information before it hits the MLS and before it hits Zillow. Here's some good examples of this. Women's Council of REALTORS is a closed group that if you are not a part of, you are missing out. Another one is all brokerages that I have ever been a part of have early coming soon meetings. Like they have halves and needs meetings on a weekly basis. If you don't have one of these going, you should start one in your brokerage. And if you don't have one of these going in your brokerage, you should be considering other brokerages, frankly. But the halves and needs meeting, you can emphasize this with your clients. The other thing that you can be thoughtful and emphasizing about or thoughtful and emphasizing is your connection to the preferred vendors that you work with within the industry. And start a conversation with these folks on a weekly basis. Here's a great example of this. I have in my local market a preferred inspector, a preferred appraiser, a preferred home renovation specialist. I have house cleaners, I have mortgage professionals, I have title companies. When I was working full time in this space, I had a weekly email that would go to these folks. And for some of them that I had good relationships with, like near friendship relationships with, these would be text messages. They would know on Monday, they're going to hear from Chris, hey, I've got ex clients that are looking for A, B and C right now. Have you heard anything that you think that would indicate you've got how that our houses are coming? I cannot tell you how many times the home cleaners and the home renovators text from me back. Oh yeah, you know, I just cleaned the house of over on 123 Main Street. They mentioned that they were getting ready to list the property for sale. It does not take rocket science to do this on a weekly basis. And in fact, once you establish this sort of regular routine, these folks reach out to you. Right. And then, like I'm not compensating them for the individual referrals, that's illegal. But what I am doing is on a quarterly and then just a spontaneous basis. I'm shooting them a gift card to downtown Trevor City. I'm getting them a, you know, a restaurant, you know, a binom lunch at x, y and z. I'm building relationships by the, by means of incentivizing good communication. It works, guys. It doesn't take, it doesn't happen overnight, but it works. Yeah, I know a lot of agents. So for anyone out there that's sorry, interrupted myself, I was going to say for agents that have done successful transactions with other broker, other agents at other firms, this is a great time to reach out and reconnect with those agents, say, hey, I just wanted to touch base. I felt like we did a great job on x, y, z property. And just so you know, I have really motivated buyers right now. So if you ever have something coming down the pike, you know, feel free to let me know about it. And I would be, you know, honored to, you know, to give you feedback and present this first to my clients. So you're right. I think it's a proactive play. You have to reach out to, in your case, the vendor example was a great one because I wasn't totally sure where you were going to go with that. I was like, how are the vendors going to know, oh, well, of course, they work on properties. They are going to know things like that. So that's, that's a great, a divorce attorneys, another, another great one. Oh, yeah, absolutely. I mean, it's unfortunate, but, but technically a good source of, of home need people with, with those needs. So I think that's right. So that's an interesting play. The hey, Mr and Mrs. buyer, you know, here's what, here's how it used to work with respect to, you know, finding a property, paying your agent, you know, going through really the explanation of compensation, but also services, right? You really talked about, you know, in the past buyers, buyer agents didn't have to do too much to, to, you know, collect a check. I mean, it's, it's not that they didn't work hard. Of course, they work hard. I'm sorry, I should have, I misspoke. They didn't have to do much explaining to the client to be able to collect the check at the end of that successful transaction. And they should have, but they didn't, you know, they didn't. And so here, here we are. But now we have this opportunity, and you've been saying this for months and months, to really distinguish ourselves as an agent, why are we getting paid, you know, x percent? Well, and now I think it may be a bit uncomfortable to have those conversations with buyers, but only really because the fear of the unknown and doing something new and having the buyer say, I don't want to pay that, right? Yes, those, those are challenges. And there's hopefully going to be some solutions. I don't know who's, if anyone can come to the rescue there, perhaps maybe a lender, one day will figure out a way to load a commission into, into a purchase. But for now, you can at least say, here's why I charge what I charge. And here's what I'm actually going to do. And then, of course, you have to do it, which is the hardest part. But I think that's a very interesting idea. So, you know, years ago, we used to say clients don't need, need the buyer's agent to allow to find a property because, you know, there's access to that everywhere. And there still is access to that everywhere. And so now you really have to dive into those private listing networks or, you know, other brokerages, if you don't have one that does have a coming soon, kind of, inventory pool. And really just connecting with those agents who you know get deals closed. And saying, hey, let's work together here. You know, you have, you know, I'll send, you know, I'll let you know when I've got something advice for us. And then those vendor partners, I love that, that, you know, sending, sending them business, of course, as well, like making sure that they know specifically what you need and how you can service their clients and make them look good. Yep, 100%. And, you know, on that, you mentioned something that I know, it wasn't on our agenda to talk about. But I did want to tell you, on the note of a lender rolling, you know, finding a way to roll commissions into loans. I'm starting to hear whispers of lenders who aren't doing that because it's just the commissions, the mortgage finance system in the United States with our current restrictions regulations. It's just a lot of people are trying, it's just aren't ways to kind of diesel in the commission. But what I am seeing is some bankers really, I was really interesting. I applaud this. The idea of partnering a mortgage loan with a personal loan, the personal loan is for paying the commission and using the home, like the property purchase as collateral for the personal loan to you are essentially creating, it's like a mini second mortgage, but it's not called a mini second mortgage. It's not, yeah, it serves functionally the same, but it's still a little sticky because, you know, you're trying to get a loan on a property you don't actually own yet as collateral. So there's a lot of really interesting conversation that happened around this. I'm glad I'm not a mortgage broker right now. The opportunity for innovation is huge. I'm just glad someone else was doing that. One final question for you and this is just a prediction and understanding that, you know, you may or may not have the crystal ball accurately or clear on this one because I've talked to a lot of different people who have a lot of different answers to this. Do you suspect this fall we start to see 0% co-ops? And if, I mean, you technically have started to see them a bit now, will that become more normalized in the next, let's just say 12 months or curious to get just to get your thoughts on what your prediction is. Yeah. So I think the answer to that is yes, but it's by sector of the real estate market. This is not going to be, I'm going to get so much crap for saying this. I'm sorry, in advance to people who love and care about me and have to read this stuff. But I mean, here's the reality. Poor people are going to be affected much more substantially by this move than rich people. And what I mean by this is we are going to see 0% co-ops on the low end of the market. We are going to see that. Those folks are going to opt for a 0% co-op commission on the sale of their $200,000 home because that's $6,000 right there. If you're dividing up a traditional 6% commission rate, that 3% means a lot to them. And again, for better or worse, if you are buying a home that is $200,000, you're likely to be able to put the bill for that commission rate is lower. It's just statistically is lower. Folks who are buying $200,000 homes, but more than 50% of them couldn't weather more than 45 days unemployed, let alone have an extra $6,000 sitting around for their real estate commission. So the answer is yes, we are going to see this and consumers are going to become empowered by this settlement at the low end of the market to find opportunities to save money where they can. But it will be to their own market detriment, I'm sorry to say. One thing I do want to throw out here though is in the higher ends of the market, I think we are much less likely to see this. And in the luxury end of the market, I think it will be almost never will we see this. And I will speak very briefly on the fact that I spent all week last week in Los Angeles at an event that my team at luxury presence put on for the top 1% of real estate professionals in the entire country. I had a chance to speak with dozens of extraordinarily high performing real estate professionals, many of whom I'm not going to name names here, but many of whom appear on Bravo and Netflix and all the different places where you glamorize and romanticize the life of a real estate agent. A lot of these folks are already telling me we've been having these conversations with our clients for years, for literally for years. We prove to them how much we are worth at the first conversation. And there is an understanding that we are working, we are demonstrating this value. And there is a like a financial literacy on the part of the buyers in those situations and sellers to realize, yeah, I'm stroking the check for the buyers commission relative to the way that the proceeds shake out. But it's the buyer who's bringing the funds to the table in order to actually secure the property. So I think it will happen more frequently on the low end. It'll happen less frequently as the prices go up. And once you get North for a million dollars, I doubt you'll see it at all. Yeah, I agree. It certainly just makes logical sense. And so that does impact people purchasing and selling with lower price properties disproportionately. And you're right, you do have sellers that are going to say, I'd like to keep that $6,000. And let's just throw it up and see what happens. Maybe we will get somebody who's willing to do it. And so I think it'll be a lot of like, hey, let's just give it a shot. And I think, well, we'll see. I hope that I hope that, well, I don't know what I hope for. I guess we'll see. We'll see what happens. But anyway, Chris, let's wrap up with your speaking schedule. Do you have any upcoming events that people should be aware of? Yeah, I sure do. Actually, let's see here. If you are a REALTOR in Alberta, Canada, I will be at an event in Edmonton, the week of September 16, 17th and 18th. And boy, I wish I had the name of that event right on the top of my head, but I do not. So if you're in Canada, first of all, you know, hello, a glad to see you. And you probably know what I'm talking about here. I can't recall the name of the event, but if you're in Canada, if you're in Edmonton, I'd love to see you. If you are heading to the NAR conference in Boston this November, I will be a featured speaker there. If you are a REALTOR in New York, New Jersey or Pennsylvania, I will be in at Triple Play in Atlantic City this December.
