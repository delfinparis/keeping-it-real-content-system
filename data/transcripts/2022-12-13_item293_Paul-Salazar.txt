[00:04:19] Welcome to the show.
[00:04:20] Wow, that was quite the intro there.
[00:04:24] Well, it's so funny.
[00:04:25] I was feeling weird hearing all that stuff.
[00:04:27] Yeah, right.
[00:04:29] It is weird.
[00:04:31] I had somebody recently interviewed me,
[00:04:33] which very rarely happens.
[00:04:35] And they went through list of things
[00:04:37] like I was just mentioning you.
[00:04:38] And I was like, well, I don't like to hear that at all.
[00:04:41] It just doesn't sound right for somebody.
[00:04:43] I know, it feels weird.
[00:04:44] I mean, it's great, but it also feels weird.
[00:04:46] Well, I would love to talk about all of how you got into luxury.
[00:04:52] But also, let's start at the very beginning
[00:04:54] of your real estate sort of journey.
[00:04:56] How did you get into real estate and why?
[00:05:00] OK, so let's start from college, right?
[00:05:04] Because let's start from like my culture.
[00:05:07] I'm Colombian.
[00:05:08] And almost everybody in my family
[00:05:10] they have their own business.
[00:05:12] They're entrepreneurs.
[00:05:13] My dad, my brothers, my cousins.
[00:05:15] And uncles, right?
[00:05:16] So it's kind of in our blood to have our own thing.
[00:05:19] Not to have a boss.
[00:05:20] Not to be told what to do, right?
[00:05:22] So that's one.
[00:05:23] Two is that in college, I finished college
[00:05:27] on a study abroad program called semester at C.
[00:05:30] And that was my last semester of college.
[00:05:32] I finished that and then I went into the real world
[00:05:36] and I was like, what am I going to do?
[00:05:39] Like I just finished traveling in the world
[00:05:40] with a bunch of college kids, having a blast, drinking,
[00:05:43] party, traveling, literally,
[00:05:46] circumnavigating the entire globe.
[00:05:48] And I was pretty depressed.
[00:05:50] I got to tell you I was not in a good place.
[00:05:53] I was working with my dad.
[00:05:54] He has his own business.
[00:05:56] But I knew I didn't want to be in his business.
[00:05:59] But I also knew I didn't want to have like a regular
[00:06:02] nine to five job, right?
[00:06:04] So I'm like, what am I going to do?
[00:06:06] I don't really have any capital to start a business.
[00:06:09] My mom was in real estate at Century 21 Beach.
[00:06:13] I went to the countryside in Rancho Cucamanga,
[00:06:14] which is where I went to high school,
[00:06:16] and which is where I lived while I was commuting
[00:06:18] back and forth to college at UC Riverside.
[00:06:21] So I would say about three months after semester at C,
[00:06:26] I had a few interviews with some regular nine to five jobs.
[00:06:31] And it just wasn't clicking for me.
[00:06:34] And then my mom came into my room.
[00:06:36] I vividly remember this day.
[00:06:39] And she used to call me Babito.
[00:06:43] So she's like, Babito, why don't you come sell real estate
[00:06:46] with me?
[00:06:47] And this is in 06, right?
[00:06:49] So the market is still on fire.
[00:06:51] She's doing the perfect time to get in, 06.
[00:06:54] Yeah, yeah.
[00:06:55] She doing really well.
[00:06:56] She's traveling.
[00:06:58] She's selling a bunch of real estate.
[00:07:01] I'm like, that sounds good.
[00:07:03] I was like, all right.
[00:07:04] I was like, yeah, sure.
[00:07:05] Let's do it.
[00:07:06] And so that's how I started to get into real estate
[00:07:10] is selling real estate in Rancho Cucamango for a sentient 21
[00:07:13] beach set.
[00:07:14] Wow.
[00:07:15] And you came in at such an interesting time.
[00:07:17] I actually bought my first condo in 2006.
[00:07:20] And upon retrospect, maybe not the ideal time for me
[00:07:25] to have bought a condo.
[00:07:26] Of course, none of us really knew that back then.
[00:07:28] It wasn't like the writing was so obviously on the wall, of course.
[00:07:32] But so you started towards the end of that boom.
[00:07:37] And what was it like starting off in 2006?
[00:07:43] You know, I'm very grateful that I got at least
[00:07:46] the year of decent market under my belt of doing transactions
[00:07:51] with my mom as I'm learning the business, right?
[00:07:55] I also helped enhance her business as well,
[00:07:57] because I had a business background in college, right?
[00:08:01] Which helped a little bit, let's be honest.
[00:08:03] You don't really learn a lot in college,
[00:08:04] at least specific to real estate.
[00:08:07] But I think I was able to use what I learned in college
[00:08:11] to help her grow her business.
[00:08:13] And so we created the Salazar team.
[00:08:15] Those team Salazar, that was the name of our team, just me and her.
[00:08:19] And we had like a part time assistant.
[00:08:23] And again, I'm very grateful I didn't start in 08,
[00:08:25] because I probably wouldn't have made it.
[00:08:27] And I probably wouldn't have still be in the business.
[00:08:29] So it allowed me to stay in the business
[00:08:32] to have some money saved up for the rainy days of 2008 through 2012, right?
[00:08:43] So again, very, very grateful for it.
[00:08:46] But at the same time, I was selling very small properties,
[00:08:52] you know, $200,000 properties, $300,000.
[00:08:55] Every once in a while we'll break a $500,000 property.
[00:08:58] And I was really excited about that.
[00:09:00] But it was great.
[00:09:02] I'm getting very, very grateful for the opportunity
[00:09:05] that my mom gave me.
[00:09:07] Yeah, it's a really good opportunity
[00:09:10] to be able to work with somebody who's established, who's successful.
[00:09:15] And also you get to learn.
[00:09:17] So I imagine your mom was, I imagine, a pretty great mentor to you.
[00:09:23] She was.
[00:09:24] And we've always had a really great relationship.
[00:09:26] And I was living, you know, so my parents were divorced already.
[00:09:29] So it was just me and her in the house.
[00:09:32] So again, if you're starting real estate
[00:09:34] and you have like a bunch of bills and debt, it's really hard
[00:09:38] because it takes about three to six months, maybe a year to get, you know, get going.
[00:09:43] So living at home really allowed me to, I had very, very little bills, you know,
[00:09:49] maybe the $1,000, maybe $2,000 a month, which is nothing, right?
[00:09:54] And retrospect, you know?
[00:09:55] So if I closed one big deal, big being, you know, $300,000 or something like that,
[00:10:00] I would keep $5,000 and I would have enough money for like three months.
[00:10:04] And that's what I would do.
[00:10:06] I would save up the money and I knew I had enough money to last me another six months.
[00:10:10] And then I just kept on growing that nest egg to a year to two years.
[00:10:15] And I just kind of kept on growing from there.
[00:10:17] Wow.
[00:10:18] And at what point did you decide to make a shift from working with your mom
[00:10:22] or working in Rancho Cucamanga?
[00:10:24] And then, you know, making a shift to where you are now?
[00:10:28] Yeah.
[00:10:29] So, so, you know, the crash happened at the end of 07 in 08, right?
[00:10:34] I started selling some short sales.
[00:10:36] That's what kind of kept me kind of going is just selling short sales, right?
[00:10:42] And my mom always pushed me, she's like, Bapito, you can always sell, you know, luxury properties.
[00:10:47] Like, why don't you go out there and do like Beverly Hills and like start selling
[00:10:51] some luxury properties?
[00:10:52] And to me, I always had doubts, you know, like my mindset wasn't there.
[00:10:56] Like, I was like, I don't think I can do that.
[00:10:58] I don't know anybody there.
[00:10:59] I don't know the market there.
[00:11:00] I don't have any connections.
[00:11:01] And even though we live only an hour away, but I could be from Ohio.
[00:11:06] I'd be the same thing.
[00:11:07] 
[00:11:07] You know, like another universe almost, yeah, a completely different universe.
[00:11:11] And I had no connections.
[00:11:12] Like, I literally knew nobody that lived in that area.
[00:11:15] My whole family was in Rancho or Pasadena or in this area, right?
[00:11:19] So at the time, my girlfriend lived in Brentwood, which is like West,
[00:11:25] West LA, the West Side, right?
[00:11:28] And so I was commuting back and forth, right?
[00:11:30] And my mom had gone to Columbia in 2000, at the beginning of 2009, or actually
[00:11:34] or 2008 or something like that.
[00:11:36] And she had met her now husband, right?
[00:11:39] So it was a perfect transition.
[00:11:41] She's like, she had called me and she was on vacation for like a month in Columbia.
[00:11:46] And she's like, hey, I wanted to let you know that I met some guy in it.
[00:11:49] Like my heart dropped.
[00:11:50] It's like we even met some guy, you know, in Columbia.
[00:11:53] And she's like, yeah, I met some guy in Columbia and, you know, of course,
[00:11:57] being the son and, you know, she's being the boss.
[00:11:59] I was very protective.
[00:12:00] Sure.
[00:12:01] I was like, I don't know about this mom.
[00:12:03] She was like, yeah, we're going to get it.
[00:12:04] Like think about getting married.
[00:12:05] I'm like, you just met the guy like a month ago, you know?
[00:12:08] So, but it ended up working out, right?
[00:12:11] So since I was commuting back and forth, my mom had now planned to move to
[00:12:16] Columbia to go live with her now husband.
[00:12:19] It was a perfect transition for me to be like, you know what?
[00:12:22] Let me move to LA.
[00:12:24] Let me try it out.
[00:12:25] You know, give it a shot.
[00:12:26] I had saved enough money for about six months of living in LA, right?
[00:12:32] So my plan was I moved to LA to downtown LA, so which is kind of like
[00:12:37] not in Beverly Hills or not in the West Side where I live now.
[00:12:40] But kind of like a like a middle ground because like all my friends and family
[00:12:44] still live in Rancho, right?
[00:12:45] So I didn't want to be too far away from them as well.
[00:12:49] So I moved to downtown LA with with my best friend from college.
[00:12:53] And we got to place together and I didn't have a job.
[00:12:57] I moved to LA without having a job.
[00:12:59] And I said, I said to myself, do I want to start selling real estate?
[00:13:03] It's going to take me a while to get going.
[00:13:05] I don't have a budget to market myself.
[00:13:06] I don't know anybody.
[00:13:07] I don't know any of the markets.
[00:13:09] I don't know any of the areas.
[00:13:10] I don't know anything about the market, right?
[00:13:12] So I was starting from scratch.
[00:13:14] I knew how to I had a close at that time, probably about 30 deals, 30 or 40
[00:13:18] deals with my mom over the last couple of years, the last three years.
[00:13:22] So I knew about the transaction, right?
[00:13:25] But I didn't know about the players.
[00:13:27] I didn't know about how to sell luxury real estate, which is completely
[00:13:29] different than selling a house that's worth, you know, $200, $300,000.
[00:13:35] So so she moved to Columbia in 2009.
[00:13:37] I moved to downtown LA and I said, you know what, what I should do is I should
[00:13:42] probably work underneath a top agent, right?
[00:13:45] So I emailed my resume to about, you know, 10,000 agents.
[00:13:49] I downloaded all the emails.
[00:13:52] Smart.
[00:13:53] I love that all the emails from the MLS and I had emailed and I was, I emailed
[00:13:57] every single person, right?
[00:14:00] I got I got a bunch of interviews.
[00:14:02] I got about 17 interviews, you know, and my last interview was a call with
[00:14:07] Chad Rogers, who was at the time on a million dollar listing on Bravo.
[00:14:12] He was one of the original cast members.
[00:14:13] And he was working at Hilton in Highland.
[00:14:16] And when I've doing my research, I'm like, this is the best firm in LA,
[00:14:21] one of the best firms in the world.
[00:14:23] I really want to be at this firm, you know, and I had gotten no calls from
[00:14:27] anybody at Hilton in Highland.
[00:14:29] The last call I got was from Chad.
[00:14:30] He called me.
[00:14:31] He left a message and he's like, yeah, I'm on million dollar listing.
[00:14:35] I'm like, I have no idea who you are.
[00:14:36] I don't watch the show.
[00:14:38] Right?
[00:14:39] Which he actually liked, right?
[00:14:41] So yeah, sure.
[00:14:41] Called them.
[00:14:42] Yeah.
[00:14:42] Because you weren't, you didn't want to hang out with him because he was on TV.
[00:14:46] Exactly.
[00:14:47] 
[00:14:48] So, so I called him up.
[00:14:50] We had an interview and it was a match.
[00:14:52] It was perfect.
[00:14:54] So and, and, you know, I, you know, I have to give a lot of, you know, of,
[00:14:59] of gratitude and a lot of credit to Chad for giving me the opportunity to be
[00:15:03] working under him because he was selling big properties, you know, you know,
[00:15:07] 15, 18, 20, 21, 22, 23, 23 million dollar properties.
[00:15:13] So because of him, I was able to get into the luxury market.
[00:15:17] And I stayed with him for a long time, for about 10 years.
[00:15:20] I should have left earlier.
[00:15:22] And I think the reason why I didn't leave is because again, my mindset wasn't there.
[00:15:25] I didn't feel that I, I can, I could, I could sell real estate on my own, you know.
[00:15:31] Right.
[00:15:31] So Chad really taught me how to, how to deal with these high net worth individuals.
[00:15:37] How to deal with business managers, how to deal with, how to deal with lawyers,
[00:15:40] how the transaction worked, how to list properties in this, in these areas, you know,
[00:15:45] and his, his community was Malibu colony.
[00:15:48] And if you're not familiar with Malibu colony, it's, it's only 120 houses right on the beach in Malibu.
[00:15:53] It's a gated community.
[00:15:55] Sting lives there.
[00:15:57] Jason stayed in Pamela, Anderson.
[00:16:00] I mean, so many celebrities call this place home and his, his, his family owned a house there.
[00:16:05] So he grew up in this, in this community.
[00:16:07] So most of the deals that we, that we did were in this community.
[00:16:12] So I really got to know all the big players from, from working with him, you know,
[00:16:17] the only thing, the only downside with working with Chad is that he already had a network, right.
[00:16:22] So he wasn't really out there prospecting like I do nowadays.
[00:16:26] Sure.
[00:16:26] So I really didn't learn the business side of real estate through Chad.
[00:16:31] I just learned how to, how to talk to people that are lawyers or CEOs,
[00:16:36] or billionaires, right.
[00:16:39] I learned how to communicate with these kind of people because he would, he would give me a deal.
[00:16:43] Like he would say, hey, Paul, this is my listing and I would take it on from there.
[00:16:47] Like I, I did most of the work.
[00:16:48] I really helped him on his business.
[00:16:50] And, and we did well together and we did well together.
[00:16:52] And, and I think, I think after, after 10 years, I think what, what, what helped me make that transition from,
[00:17:02] you know, the mindset was just like, I, I, again, I just didn't feel
[00:17:06] I guess worthy enough or I didn't feel I had the capability of going on my own.
[00:17:11] Like I feel like I needed somebody to help me out, you know.
[00:17:14] And I so, I started to listen to like, to like some podcasts and Tom Ferries podcast
[00:17:19] really kind of resonated with me.
[00:17:21] Sure.
[00:17:21] Really loved to hear what he had to say.
[00:17:24] And I started to listen to him, you know, he's like, he was, he was talking about cold calling.
[00:17:28] And I was like, I've never cold called in my, you know, at this time,
[00:17:31] I think I was in the business for about 13 years.
[00:17:33] And I never cold called once in my entire career.
[00:17:37] And, and probably didn't want to either.
[00:17:39] You're probably like, I don't want to have to do that.
[00:17:41] Yeah.
[00:17:41] I, yeah, exactly.
[00:17:42] I, it's like, it was really scary for me.
[00:17:45] And at that time when I was working with Chad, I was his assistant.
[00:17:48] And then after a couple of years, it was like a hybrid model.
[00:17:50] And we also actually had an assistant.
[00:17:52] So as me, him and we had an assistant.
[00:17:54] So he would give me deals.
[00:17:55] I would hold his open houses.
[00:17:57] I would get a deals through, through that.
[00:17:59] I would get deals now through some like friendships that I had in, in LA.
[00:18:03] So I kind of started to grow my business, but I didn't really grow that, that, that big.
[00:18:07] That's why I was also scared to leave him because I didn't really have big, you know,
[00:18:11] a big source of business because I would also get like a, like a,
[00:18:14] like a small percentage of his business as well.
[00:18:16] But if I left him, I wouldn't be getting that anymore.
[00:18:19] Right.
[00:18:20] So that's how it started, you know, it's, um, it was a long, it was a long journey,
[00:18:25] which had, I learned a lot.
[00:18:27] I should have left earlier, like probably after five years, but I didn't.
[00:18:30] And, um, after, you know, listening to Tom, Tom's podcast for about three months,
[00:18:36] I joined his coaching program.
[00:18:38] And after that, I started cold calling.
[00:18:40] I got a couple of my own listings and then I left chat right after that.
[00:18:44] Wow.
[00:18:45] I, so I have a few questions.
[00:18:46] I want to go actually, um, thank you.
[00:18:48] That is a really incredible story.
[00:18:50] And there's more to the story.
[00:18:52] I know, um, I want to go back to just this really smart idea that in all the episodes,
[00:18:58] we've done, I don't think anyone has ever suggested and it was a really good idea.
[00:19:03] Because they're so obviously teams are, or whether or not you want to be a solo practitioner or a team,
[00:19:09] having a mentor, regardless, is a great idea for so many listeners.
[00:19:14] So Paul did something very creative and something that literally anybody can do,
[00:19:19] which is he got, he, well, in your case, you scraped a list of off the MLS of REALTOR emails.
[00:19:24] He can also buy these lists.
[00:19:25] They're really not that expensive.
[00:19:27] A couple hundred bucks, maybe for your local area.
[00:19:30] And then he just, you know, fired out 10,000 emails and that is absolutely doable.
[00:19:35] So if anyone out there is listening, um, that is essentially how Paul got to
[00:19:40] into luxury property.
[00:19:42] He, he invested in reaching out to everyone in his local area and got 17 interviews.
[00:19:48] And I mean, it's, it is, it is remarkable.
[00:19:50] I was just talking to one of the very top producers here in Chicago.
[00:19:55] Yesterday, and I was asking her how often, and she's a solo practitioner.
[00:19:59] And she does about 160 million a year, just herself alone.
[00:20:05] And yeah, she's amazing.
[00:20:07] And she, I was like, how often do people email, do REALTORS email you asking for mentorship,
[00:20:13] coaching, she's like, oh, and she's super nice and very sweet.
[00:20:17] She's like almost never.
[00:20:19] So it's one of those things that I guess sometimes we think maybe those people are getting
[00:20:23] inundated and maybe they are, but maybe they're not.
[00:20:26] 
[00:20:26] And so I just wanted to honor you for, for, for sort of being creative in that step.
[00:20:30] I've never heard of anyone doing that.
[00:20:32] Now that's what us recruiters do.
[00:20:34] We get those lists.
[00:20:35] Yeah.
[00:20:36] What do we recruit REALTORS?
[00:20:37] So recruiters do this all the time.
[00:20:40] But individual agents, unless, unless it's like, oh, I have, I have a listing and I want to,
[00:20:44] I want to email every REALTOR to let them know about it.
[00:20:47] That's another reason why sometimes people do it.
[00:20:49] But as far as like to find a mentor or a partner, boy,
[00:20:52] what a smart idea.
[00:20:54] So again, I just wanted to step on that a little bit because I think it was a really,
[00:20:57] really smart play.
[00:20:59] The other thing too, I want to talk about so many of our listeners and,
[00:21:04] and I've obviously, you know, people who are your peers are probably like,
[00:21:07] how do you get into luxury?
[00:21:09] Well, you just told the story of how you got introduced to that world.
[00:21:12] But then there's that whole step of like, I didn't grow up in Malibu.
[00:21:16] I didn't, I don't, I didn't grow up in this gated community of 120 homes where everybody
[00:21:20] knows me because those are my neighbors.
[00:21:22] And that's what I grew up with.
[00:21:24] And, and yes, you were introduced to that world.
[00:21:27] But then it is this pretty big shift of like, I'm going to cut the cord and try to build
[00:21:32] my own business.
[00:21:33] And, and he said, looking back, you know, maybe you stayed longer than, then you needed to.
[00:21:38] But that does require a massive mine shift change to say, okay, I can, I can survive and thrive
[00:21:44] in that world, even though that isn't my background.
[00:21:47] It isn't necessarily what I, what I've known my whole life.
[00:21:51] So I'm curious on what you learned with Tom Ferry's coaching program, which everybody who listens,
[00:21:57] probably knows who Tom Ferry is.
[00:21:59] If not, he's, he's an, he's incredible.
[00:22:01] His dad, Mike Ferry is kind of a famous guy in the, in the, in the coaching movement.
[00:22:07] Brian Bafini's another guy.
[00:22:08] So it's usually Mike Ferry, Brian Bafini and Tom Ferry are kind of like the three biggest names.
[00:22:13] And all three of them have, have really great stuff to offer.
[00:22:16] Tom Ferry has kind of, kind of having his moment the last like 10 years.
[00:22:20] He's kind of a bit the guy who's, everyone's kind of paying attention to.
[00:22:23] But what did you learn from, from Tom's coaching, you know, coaching partners about how to shift your mindset?
[00:22:30] I mean, so much, right?
[00:22:32] I mean, there are so many different tips that, that, that he kind of suggested, you know, affirmations,
[00:22:40] some books, right?
[00:22:42] But I, I think for me, I think the biggest shift was, at the time, I, you know, I was, I was single.
[00:22:49] And I had just started dating this girl, who is now my girlfriend, and she was an entrepreneur,
[00:22:54] you know, and she was out there, you know, you know, just like putting herself out there, you know?
[00:23:00] And I wasn't doing that. And so she, she really kind of inspired me to be like, you know,
[00:23:05] I can do more, right? Like I can, I can do more with myself. Like I don't, I don't, I don't need
[00:23:11] somebody else to help me. I can do it on my own, you know, and it's, it's, I think I, I don't know
[00:23:17] if there was one thing I think it was just kind of listening to his podcast and all, actually,
[00:23:21] the interviews, just like this, this kind of interview that like Tom would do and the interviews that,
[00:23:26] that, that you do DJ are so important because they allow the listeners to get inspired to hear
[00:23:33] the stories because to me, those stories really helped me be like, wow, that person did it, that
[00:23:39] person did it. And now I started to say, why can't I do it, you know? So those stories really
[00:23:44] helped me out. And when I was rich had, I, I wasn't really into the business, like I was more
[00:23:49] traveling, I was partying. So I wasn't really focused on my career. I was really more focused on
[00:23:55] just having a good time, to be honest. Sure. And, you know, since I had a girlfriend, I had more time
[00:24:02] to kind of focus on my career instead of, you know, traveling and doing all these other things,
[00:24:06] right? But I think hearing the stories was really the most important thing for me in kind of
[00:24:12] shifting the mindset, right? Because I heard all these stories of all these other amazing agents
[00:24:17] that started from nothing or they, you know, didn't have anything or it, there was, you know,
[00:24:22] everybody has their own story, right? And some stories I can't relate to as much as as other
[00:24:27] stories, right? So like, like I may relate to certain people, but I may not relate to other people,
[00:24:32] right? Sure. But, but, but listening to those interviews was my favorite thing. And, and to this day,
[00:24:37] I still love to hear those interviews because I learned so much about what these people do,
[00:24:42] how they grew their business. And I always take one or two things and I implement that in my business.
[00:24:47] I want to pause for a moment to talk about our episode sponsor, our one of my favorite companies out
[00:24:52] there, follow up boss. Now, after interviewing hundreds of top REALTORS in the country for the
[00:24:57] podcast, do you know which CRM is used by more than any other buyer guests? Of course, it is
[00:25:02] follow up boss. And let's face it, following up is the key to taking your business to the next level.
[00:25:08] Follow up boss will help you drive more leads in less time and with less effort. Do not take my
[00:25:14] word for it. Robert Slack, who runs the number one team in the US uses follow up boss and he is

[00:26:06] episode. Yeah, well, boy, that's exactly our goal on the show. So I'm glad that that worked for
[00:26:14] you because you know, it's funny. I was thinking like, oh, it would be really fun to have Chad on
[00:26:19] the show and it probably wouldn't. I'm sure he's an um, he would be excellent. But the moment
[00:26:24] people here, oh, like if I say, how'd you get into luxury? He's like, well, but you know, I grew
[00:26:28] up in this area that, you know, that's a immediately when a lot of our listeners would be like, oh,
[00:26:33] okay. Well, I didn't, I didn't grow up in an environment like that. So yes, easy for that guy.
[00:26:39] And of course, it isn't necessarily easy if just because you grow up in that environment, but it is
[00:26:44] not as relatable, right? And so I love that you that that you sort of infiltrated it in a good way
[00:26:51] and sort of went, oh, I belong here. I can thrive in this environment and just learning
[00:26:56] how to communicate and maybe with people who are in that ultra high net worth space and understanding
[00:27:03] their needs, understanding what the goals of people like that who I imagine there's people,
[00:27:10] you have clients that probably have whole teams of people that you have to meet with financial
[00:27:15] people, accountants, attorneys, agents, whoever it might be. It's not, I imagine it's not just
[00:27:21] usually like one single buyer and one seller and then the agents on either side. So what would you
[00:27:29] say? So anyway, just to continue on in your story. So you decided, you know, you got the courage to
[00:27:35] kind of go off on on your own, cut the cord. And then, you know, did you feel at that point
[00:27:41] that you had made enough headway into your your sphere of influence that you were able to sort of
[00:27:47] survive that way? You know, I again, I think I've always had enough money to survive six or 12
[00:27:55] months. And I think that's an important thing for agents to hear, right? And I don't have any kids,
[00:28:00] right? I don't have any kids yet. So it's easier for me to to grow that like nest egg, right?
[00:28:06] Just for me. But you know, for for anybody else, everybody knows how much they need every single
[00:28:12] month to be able to say, you know, what if I'm going to go into a new business or to a new venture,
[00:28:16] I have this much time to to actually excel before I'm like, you know, broke, right? So I've always
[00:28:23] been comfortable in that regards where, you know, I could have again, I could have left, you know,
[00:28:28] five years before leaving Chad, you know, because I had that money, I just didn't have the courage,
[00:28:33] right? So for me, it was luckily, the coach I had was very inspiring too. Her name is Mary Jett,
[00:28:41] she is now the head of all coaches at Tom Ferry. She is an amazing person. She is like,
[00:28:48] she's just like a mom, you know, and she was coaching John Grommon, who was like one of the top
[00:28:53] agents in the in the in the nation. She was coaching Gary Gold, who saw the the playboy mentioned
[00:29:00] who was at hillton in Highland. And Gary was actually the one who recommended me to Mary Jett,
[00:29:05] you know, so I again, very grateful to Gary Gold, who's now a co-op banker, because I call him,
[00:29:12] I said, Hey, Gary, I know that you're coaching with Tom Ferry. And when I'm doing, you know,
[00:29:16] all my research is like, yeah, you know, call my coach Mary Jett. So I call Mary Jett. She's
[00:29:23] and she's like, Hey, you know, why don't I send you, you know, three or four recommendations
[00:29:29] here at the Tom Ferry coaching, you know, network that that may be able to assist you.
[00:29:33] I talked to those coaches, but I didn't have the same connection that I have with Mary Jett,
[00:29:38] you know. So I call Mary Jett again. I said, Hey, Mary Jett, I know you're busy. I know you have
[00:29:43] a lot of clients. I'm very coachable. I am ready to go and please coach me, because I know that you
[00:29:51] have, you know, what it takes to help me grow my business. And she said, you know, what Paul,
[00:29:57] let's do it. And so again, so so grateful for Mary, because she actually really inspired me to
[00:30:02] leave Chad. She didn't push me. She inspired me. That's the difference. I did it on my own.
[00:30:09] She was actually shocked. After two months of being coached by her, I left Chad. And then three
[00:30:15] months later, I hired my first assistant. Wow. Yeah. And you know, so what I, what I'm really
[00:30:21] hearing is she gave you the courage to bet on yourself. Yeah. Yeah. And it's, it's funny too,
[00:30:28] because betting on yourself is a very scary endeavor, even for the most confident person, because
[00:30:35] it also could, could not go well. And, and in your case, you know, you really have to commit,
[00:30:41] and you did, and, and you made it work. So, so you, you left, you found the courage to do that.
[00:30:48] Your coach, of course, helped you, you know, change your mindset to this like you can do this,
[00:30:53] but also I'm not going to push you to do it. It's a decision you have to make on your own,
[00:30:57] whether you do it or not. I'm still your coach. And, and, and, and you did it. And, and then,
[00:31:03] and then how did things, you know, blossom from there? Well, so again, I didn't have a network,
[00:31:09] even though I've been in LA for a long time, you know, I think my network was really outside of LA,
[00:31:15] you know, I, I had a small network in LA from, you know, just kind of meeting people, you know,
[00:31:20] going out and whatnot. But I really didn't, I, I'm not really a networker, you know, that's not how I
[00:31:25] get my business, right? And a lot of people in LA that are successful actually are good
[00:31:30] networkers, but that's not me. I don't like to go out at night and like smooth. That's not my thing.
[00:31:35] So when I was, you know, listening to how other agents, you know, grow their business,
[00:31:40] you know, co-calling expires was a great way to grow the business. So I started, I started co-calling
[00:31:46] expires, you know, and it was, that was so hard for me to start doing that. And I actually started
[00:31:52] co-calling expires. I think before I hired Mary J at the top-right organization. And then I hired her.
[00:31:59] But I basically started co-calling expires every single day. And I was horrible at it. And I was so,
[00:32:06] I was so nervous getting on the phone. Like it was like traumatizing for me. I'm just like,
[00:32:12] and my girlfriend is like, why, you know, what's, like what's going on? And she's also a coach
[00:32:17] herself, you know? So she was kind of coaching me through this whole process. But again, it was just
[00:32:22] like the mindset. Like I just wasn't there. And I didn't have, I guess, I don't have the
[00:32:26] confidence yet to really co-call these people. And when you're co-calling, you know, two,
[00:32:32] three, four, five, and plus million dollar houses, they're getting calls from everybody in their
[00:32:37] mind. Everybody. I mean, like people from like, like an hour away are calling them. It's nuts.
[00:32:44] So you were only calling luxury expires. Or were you okay? So you somehow subscribed? Did you
[00:32:50] subscribe to a service that gives you those leads? Or did you just find them in the MLS as they
[00:32:54] would expire? So at the time I was using red X. I'm now using
[00:32:58] Vulkan. But at the time I was using red X. And I think there's like a filter of doing like
[00:33:02] only houses over a million dollars. So I was only, I mean, like listen, anything in LA right now,
[00:33:08] anything over a million dollars is like, like a, like a tear down, you know? Yeah. So it's like,
[00:33:13] like the word luxury, it's like, I don't even know what that means anymore. Because here,
[00:33:17] here in LA is a two million dollar property, like a luxury property, because it's like a three
[00:33:22] bedroom two bath, 1200 square foot house, and a okay neighborhood. It's insane, right? So,
[00:33:28] so with that being said, you know, I started calling expires. And by the way, I want to pause
[00:33:33] you for a second because for those of you that have never, I feel like that art of calling
[00:33:38] per sale by owners, calling expired listings, isn't as popular anymore. Well, first of all,
[00:33:45] people, you know, look, most people don't like making cold calls. And calling per sale by owners
[00:33:51] or expires is, we'll say just expires expires, particularly difficult because it was on the market
[00:33:57] probably with another REALTOR. It didn't go well. It didn't property didn't transact. And so you
[00:34:04] may, you may be calling somebody who now hates REALTORS or hates the previous REALTOR or, and as you
[00:34:10] said, is also because it's a luxury property, at least by the price, it is now, you know, very
[00:34:16] attractive to everyone who buys these leads, which is a lot of agents. So you're right, people from
[00:34:21] an hour away, sure, I'll drive in for a $2 million property, of course. So now the owner is getting
[00:34:26] bombarded with you're probably not the first phone call, even of the day, when you call them. So,
[00:34:31] so can you just talk a little bit about what those calls were like just because I love the fact
[00:34:36] that you started calling fizz bows and and or sorry, I've expired listings and we're able to,
[00:34:43] you know, still still build a luxury practice out of it. Yeah, I mean, I, I knew that like that
[00:34:50] was really the only way that I wanted to do things because like, I'm not a, I'm not a networker,
[00:34:56] that's not my thing. Sure. I'm not going out at nighttime and going to events, right? So I like to
[00:35:03] be home, you know, during the week. So it's either open houses, door knocking or expires. And I still
[00:35:09] don't have the courage to go to go door knocking yet. So I started with expires, right? That was the,
[00:35:14] that was my first step into building my confidence into doing scary things. And a book that I like to read
[00:35:23] that really inspired me was a miracle morning. Oh, yeah. How how L run? Yeah. Yes, exactly. Great book.
[00:35:31] So highly recommend it for any for any listeners. So me and my girlfriend started doing that. So we
[00:35:36] started waking up early in a 545 alarm, getting up at five, you know, meditation, journal, workouts.
[00:35:45] There's a couple of other things there. I forgot what they are. But, but doing that every single
[00:35:50] morning and then that really propels you to a very successful day, you know. So I started doing that,
[00:35:57] but making the calls was really tough, you know, the good thing is that I knew the market. So that
[00:36:05] was one. I knew the market, which is really important. And number two, I was at a great brokerage,
[00:36:10] Hilton and Highland. And we only have one office and only 150 agents. So it was only really,
[00:36:16] in my office, there's only one other agent that that does expired calls. So if I'm calling,
[00:36:24] hey, it's Paul Salas or at Hilton and Highland, I kind of not not everybody, but most people will
[00:36:29] know that that brand name and they'll say, you know what, there's only a few agents at that,
[00:36:34] at that brokerage. It's a very, very popular brokerage here in the area for Highland residential.
[00:36:39] And so they gave me a little bit more respect, right? That's nice. So that definitely helped me out.
[00:36:45] Okay. But at the end of the day, you just have to know how, you know, you obviously have to have
[00:36:51] a script that you internalized. You have to know it from, you know, you have to just understand
[00:36:56] the script. There's only going to be a few different objections. And you have to know how to handle
[00:37:01] it. And more importantly, it's your tonality. Yes. That's what I learned. It's tonality is so
[00:37:07] important, right? And everybody's different. I'm really good with a certain demographic.
[00:37:14] Ladies that are like 60 plus, you know, I just went to my first listing. And you know,
[00:37:24] it was a, it was a, it was a 2.1 million dollar listing. And they had interviewed the other
[00:37:30] agent at my office who was like the king of expires in L.A. Who does a ton of expires. And I actually
[00:37:37] beat him, I beat him to the listing, which is great. And, and the way I did it was just like,
[00:37:42] I was just personable. And, and I, you know, and what I started to create after that was how do I
[00:37:49] become the best listing agent in L.A. What do I have to do to become the best listing agent in L.A.
[00:37:56] So that was really my mindset going forward is how do I create, you know, a great listing,
[00:38:04] right? So what does that involve? And how do I also show my next prospect how I just
[00:38:12] transformed this property, sold it for record price, you know, you know, short data market was on
[00:38:18] market for six months, I sold it in a weekend, you know, so I started to, to, to create those
[00:38:24] marketing pieces to help me get the next listing and the next listing and the next listing. And I started
[00:38:29] just to, just really hone in on my listing skills and my negotiation skills and my sales skills to
[00:38:35] really go from expired to sold, you know, and I have, I have like, you know, like 15 now case studies
[00:38:41] of these houses that were once on the market, I transformed them and I was able to get them sold.
[00:38:47] You know, that's, that's such a great approach. This idea of sort of what we would maybe
[00:38:53] call storytelling, this idea of, hey, let me tell you about this previous thing versus here's why
[00:39:00] I'm the best choice, which I'm sure you do have that as part of your pitch as well of like here's
[00:39:04] what I'm going to do for you. Here's the x, y and z of what I'm going to do. But let me tell you
[00:39:07] about this last property I just worked on. Here's what I did to that. Here's the result. And,
[00:39:13] you know, you're sort of sharing that, that whole journey to somebody. And that's a very powerful
[00:39:19] approach that I suspect a lot of agents don't think that way. It's more like, hey, if you look at my
[00:39:25] reputation, if you look at what I, what I do in general, I'm a big deal, or, you know, without saying
[00:39:30] I'm a big deal. Whereas you're telling very specific stories of previous experiences you have. And
[00:39:35] that is, it's a very unique approach, actually. I think that's, that's quite, quite smart. And
[00:39:40] obviously started resonating with these, with these expires. And honestly, like because of
[00:39:46] expires, like that's what helped me grow my business. Like it's because of expires. Because,
[00:39:53] you know, from there, you hold open houses, you find buyers from there, you go doorknock the
[00:39:57] neighborhood from there, you start just started little by little, start building your business.
[00:40:02] And, you know, like, I, I, again, I think 60% of my business right now is still expired,
[00:40:09] still new business. Because I don't have enough old business to get repeat clients. I don't,
[00:40:14] I don't have the like, like the luxury of being like, hey, Paul, you sold my property two years ago,
[00:40:19] I want to buy something like I rarely get those calls, maybe two or three times a year. Obviously,
[00:40:25] as I grow my business, like I'm getting more and more of those calls, but I still cannot rely on
[00:40:29] that. I still rely on circle dialing on door knocking, on sending mailers, on calling expires,
[00:40:35] and doing open houses. Let's talk about door knocking because so few of our guests on,
[00:40:41] I've had a few guests that have that have talked about door knocking. I suspect more, more have
[00:40:46] done it. Maybe just don't talk about it. But that is also, I think, a very courageous thing to do.
[00:40:53] And it's very difficult. So as you, you know, tell us your approach for door knocking just,
[00:40:58] you know, are you, are you door knocking in neighborhoods where you just, or you're currently
[00:41:02] selling a property or just sold a property, oh, by the way, I just, you know, I helped your
[00:41:06] neighbor down the street just wanted to introduce myself that kind of thing or how, how did you go about
[00:41:10] doing that? Well, I have a geo farm, right? So here here in Venice, in the West Side, Venice Beach,
[00:41:17] I have like a, you know, like a 500, you know, home, you know, community that I'm constantly working on,
[00:41:22] right? So that's, that's how I started door knocking, right? And again, this is all from Tom Ferry,
[00:41:26] Mary Jett saying, hey, you have to have a, you have to have four lead pillars. One is, you know,
[00:41:31] so when I first started coaching with them, it was geo farm, expires, open houses, and then my
[00:41:37] past clients, which is very, very little, right? So, so, you know, door knocking to me is the most
[00:41:44] effective way of prospecting. Hands down. Wow. You can't beat it. More effective than it
[00:41:49] calling expires. More, it just takes a lot of time and effort and energy. And that's why people don't
[00:41:55] do it because it's like, you have to go out there, you have to have like a marketing piece,
[00:41:58] you have to go and doorknoc. It's like, it's a, it's a lot of time and effort. You know,
[00:42:02] co-calling is a little bit easier. You're at home. You could be in your PJs. You could just, you know,
[00:42:05] get out of bed and do it, right? But when you're door knocking, you have to, you know, I have to
[00:42:09] shave, I've got to look good. I got to look presentable. I got to, I got to understand the market
[00:42:13] in this little area. But, you know, I've, from one of my door knocking deals, this is actually during
[00:42:20] COVID, right? Where I couldn't actually doork, but I was still passing out flyers. And if somebody
[00:42:27] was out in the front of the door, I was, you know, like, if they're out in the yard, I would talk to them.
[00:42:31] So funny story is like, I wanted to start, I wanted to get into selling new developments because
[00:42:40] Santiago Arana, who is one of the biggest agents in the nation, he's here in Brentwood. Actually,
[00:42:45] you know, he actually interviewed me when I first came to LA in 2009. He didn't hire me, but
[00:42:50] he's a great agent, you know, like, he, like, I always look up to him because he's kind of like me,
[00:42:54] like he's a, you know, Latin guy like me. He came from nothing and he's built an amazing business.
[00:42:59] I mean, he's a, he's a freaking baller, right? But he built his business on door knocking and,
[00:43:06] he found a lot of tear downs and he was able to sell those two developers and then the developer
[00:43:11] built a 20, 30, 40, 50 million dollar house. And now he's selling those houses, right? So that's
[00:43:16] another great way of getting the luxury space if you're in an area where there's a lot of tear downs
[00:43:22] and development opportunities, right? Is to start, you know, door knocking those houses,
[00:43:27] finding those sellers, finding the developers, which is super easy, right? So that was one of my
[00:43:33] first development deals a few years ago was during COVID, walking around in my geo farm. I knew,
[00:43:39] I picked this geo farm because it had a lot of tear down potential. And a tear down is going to
[00:43:45] be three deals, three sides, right? You rep the seller who's selling the development opportunity,
[00:43:51] you rep the developer and then you rep the developer when they sell it. And a good chance that you get
[00:43:56] a lead out of it or a buyer and you double end it. So there's a possibility for four sides and one
[00:44:03] one deal there, right? So there's a really, you know, really, you know, good chance that you can
[00:44:10] make some good money on these on these tear downs. So anyway, so I was door knocking. I met the,
[00:44:15] the older couple, they were super sweet. They knew nothing about real estate at all.
[00:44:20] Their father just had passed away. So it was a trust sell. They had to they had to pay no capital
[00:44:26] gain. So it was perfect for them. They were going to cash out. I found a great developer that I now
[00:44:30] have sold multiple deals to. And, you know, and that's how I kind of started, right? Now selling
[00:44:37] brand new developments was just by door knocking these houses.
[00:44:41] And this idea of cold calling developers not to, hey, I want to rep your next project, which,
[00:44:48] of course, every REALTOR would want that too. But you're saying, hey, I've got a deal for you
[00:44:54] essentially, not a deal. I've got a transaction possibly for you. Not a deal is in like, I've got
[00:44:59] a special offer for you. But I've got this property that that you might be interested in Mr. and
[00:45:05] Mrs. developer. I've never heard of anybody doing that. I don't know why that has never been
[00:45:09] talked about that is a brilliant approach to giving providing value to a developer to which they're
[00:45:16] like, hey, this guy's great. He's given us business. We're going to use him for, you know, maybe
[00:45:20] other things we're doing. Yeah, for sure. And I think my pitch to these sellers that own these
[00:45:29] tear downs and there's not all properties are going to be considered tear downs, you know.
[00:45:33] Sure. I always look out for my clients, no matter what. I always look out like if I was them,
[00:45:38] what would I do? Right? There's some houses that you can slap some paint on it, change some countertops,
[00:45:46] and we'll talk about that a little bit later on because I also specialize in like refurbishing a
[00:45:51] house, you know, redoing a house and selling it to an end user, right? But there's certain houses
[00:45:56] that you can't do that. It's either too small or it needs too much work and it's a perfect tear
[00:46:00] down, right? Like the developer is going to pay more than an end user, right? So what my pitches
[00:46:07] to these sellers is that I'm going to create an offering memorandum in OM, right? And that's not
[00:46:13] really used for residential brokers. They don't really understand what that means. That's for
[00:46:19] commercial agents, you know, that's our industrial buildings or office and retail or other kind of
[00:46:24] commercial real estate. So what I do is that I create it with my team like a 15, 20 page PDF
[00:46:33] and it outlines, right? This is what we're selling. This is what we're asking, you know, this is,
[00:46:39] you know, what the what the land, you know, price per square foot because we don't look at price
[00:46:43] per square foot for the house. We look at the price per square foot for the land. We show them
[00:46:47] comps of other other land sales that are similar to this in the area. We also show them comps
[00:46:54] of what a new development will sell for in the area. We also show them what they can build per the
[00:47:00] underbuilt report, which is a company here in the area that can tell me how big of a house I can build
[00:47:05] and then I email it to developers and then say give me a call. I say give me a call and now they
[00:47:11] they trust me even more because I created this great marketing piece that took me three hours
[00:47:16] and they trust me. This guy is a real deal, right? And so I start calling these developers. I said,
[00:47:21] hey, and it's so easy to find developers. So there's no excuse for anybody not to find developer.
[00:47:26] All you do is you go on the MLS, you find out all the new developments that are sold, you look
[00:47:31] at public records, you saw who sold them. If it's an LLC, you look up the LLC, you look at the
[00:47:35] manager, you you find them online, they have a website, you give them a call, it literally takes five
[00:47:40] minutes, right? It's super, super easy. So that's how it started and I luckily sold it to a great
[00:47:46] developer who I have a great relationship now and now I've already sold them a few other properties
[00:47:50] that are now being built. And that house, I sold it originally tear down for 1.6 million. So I double
[00:47:58] end that and then we sold it two months ago for 4.2 million. And and we put a big sign in front
[00:48:06] of the house as as they were building it, you know, as they were, you know, building the whole house,
[00:48:11] a huge sign, a massive sign with a QR code to a like a website and I got I got a buyer lead that I
[00:48:17] sold another house for 3.1 million. I got other leads that I'm working on right now. So it's like
[00:48:21] every single listing should give you two or three deals at the minimum one deal and if you really
[00:48:28] know how to maximize it, two or three deals. So that's why I really focus on getting listings.
[00:48:35] How many other agents do you know who prospect developers with with opportunities like that you put
[00:48:43] together? I'm curious if that's a common practice and if it is, I'm curious on how putting together
[00:48:50] that 1520 page PDF with literally step by step of like here's all the work we've done here's the
[00:48:57] options for what you can do, Mr. Mrs. Developer. And here's what we think, you know, estimated profit might
[00:49:02] be. How common is that? Are you like the only guy really doing that? Is that your sort of secret sauce
[00:49:08] or do you feel like other people are putting together similar packages? I, I, well, it's not a secret
[00:49:14] anymore. But, but I don't think anybody else is doing it. You know, again, I really pride myself
[00:49:22] in being detail oriented and creating really nice marketing pieces. Like that's my thing. Like I
[00:49:29] really want to have a nice brand. So if you go to my to my website, it's very clean. If you look at
[00:49:35] my Instagram profile, I try. It's getting better and better, right? It's not easy to like have a
[00:49:43] nice clean, bold and sophisticated look, but that's what that's what we're trying to build here.
[00:49:49] But I don't know anybody else that's that's doing that. There are a lot of agents that sell a lot
[00:49:54] of developments and they're and they're doing this, right? And the other way of getting these deals
[00:49:58] is by sending letters. So like I would drive around a whole area with my assistant and I will pick out
[00:50:04] tear down, tear down. We write the address we put on an Excel file and now we send handwritten envelopes
[00:50:11] and we send them a letter. I just close it. I'm actually under contract on the deal right now from
[00:50:16] a letter that I sent three months ago and they call me, hey, I got your letter. Do you still have
[00:50:20] that buyer? I'm like, yes, I do. I put the deal together and now we're under contract for another
[00:50:24] development deal, right? So not only doorknocking or cold calling these these tear down, but also sending
[00:50:29] letters works. I love that you're doing all of the things that you would assume a luxury agent
[00:50:36] probably doesn't have to do, right? Most luxury agents I know are not calling Fisbo's expires.
[00:50:43] They're not cold calling developers. They're not writing letters or maybe they are and maybe they're
[00:50:49] just not telling us on our show, but I appreciate that you weren't born into this luxury business.
[00:50:57] You really built it. You bootstrapped it and you saved up enough money so that you could explore
[00:51:03] that and I just go, those are the best stories I think. Let's talk about because again, so many of
[00:51:10] our agents are like, okay, I can start doing some of those things, but everybody wants to be a luxury
[00:51:16] agent. What's the major difference you've found because you do 20 plus million dollar properties as
[00:51:24] well? What's the major difference between working with a seller of a let's say a million dollar
[00:51:30] property or in LA, of course, you said everything's kind of at least in the area you service is kind
[00:51:36] of a million dollars even the smallest properties. What's the difference between working on the
[00:51:40] smallest property side to the ultra high net worth side? Are the needs and the goals basically the
[00:51:47] same or is it kind of a different world? I mean, I think at the core, it's the same thing. Somebody
[00:51:54] wants to find a home. In that respect, there's going to be an emotional attachment to selling
[00:52:01] real estate either in high end or in a lower price point. I think the only difference is that when
[00:52:11] you're selling real estate here, a lot of the times they have a business manager who can make
[00:52:15] things very difficult, a lawyer. By the way, are not emotionally involved in the property that a
[00:52:23] buyer or seller might be there emotionally involved in keeping their position, which their position
[00:52:29] is to very thoroughly review the financial component of this transaction, which I'm assuming
[00:52:36] is a big deal. So you not only have to win over the emotional side of the buyer or seller,
[00:52:41] but you also have to win over sort of the more empirical part, the objective part of dealing with
[00:52:47] now this team, which those are two very different masters to serve, I imagine. Yeah.
[00:52:52] And I think most of the people that I serve as here in LA, not everybody, but most of them are
[00:52:59] just sophisticated and they're educated and they're business owners. They're very smart people.
[00:53:08] Right? So they may know about the property more than you do. Like, if you're showing them property,
[00:53:14] they may have done all the research. So you have to be prepared a lot more than I was prepared when
[00:53:21] I was working in Rancho Cucamanga. I'm not saying you don't have to be prepared selling real estate in
[00:53:27] a smaller price point, but all I'm saying is that over here, I feel like you have to be more prepared
[00:53:32] because they are going to ask you tough questions and they're going to expect that you know that.
[00:53:38] They're going to expect that you know the market, that you know the players, that you know about
[00:53:42] the house, all that stuff. So I think that's the biggest difference. And then the other thing is
[00:53:49] when you're listing a property, I feel that you know I spend easily you know five to $6,000 per
[00:53:56] listing before it's even on the market. You know, I'm spending you know a grant, a two-grant
[00:54:02] on a photographer, same for a videographer, a floor plan. I do everything. Like we do Instagram ads,
[00:54:09] we do YouTube ads, we do Google ads for our listings. We want to be the best of the best, right? And
[00:54:16] that's how I, this is, this is my plan to get to the next level. Like I really want to start growing
[00:54:22] my business to the next level. I'm not there yet and I have a long way to go, but I know that if I keep
[00:54:28] doing this, I will get there because people are going to start noticing that I really take care of
[00:54:34] you. I'm going to look out for you and I'm going to get you top dollar or I will get you the best
[00:54:39] price if I'm revenue as the buyer's agent. Yeah, it's so funny to hear you, here's somebody say,
[00:54:45] I've sold 600 million in real estate. I'm not quite there yet. I'm just, but that's the motor
[00:54:51] that you have that keeps you going. 600 million is just where you're at today. It isn't necessarily
[00:54:57] where you want to be tomorrow, but it's so funny to hear that that really it seems like your entire
[00:55:04] career has been so much of put the blinders on, do the hard things that are maybe a little scary
[00:55:11] and uncomfortable, but are healthy and things that other agents aren't willing to do like
[00:55:15] door knocking. I mean, gosh, I would bet less than 1% of agents have ever door knocked or made a
[00:55:21] cold call quite honestly. I don't think people even do that as much anymore. And yet, here's
[00:55:27] somebody like you who still does it. And that is you would think a luxury agent wouldn't be going
[00:55:34] door to door. We sort of have our own misconceptions about what that even means, but it is one of those
[00:55:40] rare arts, this door knocking and letter writing that people really appreciate if done the right
[00:55:48] way. It's absolutely a lost art and has obviously been part of the secret, not secret, but part of
[00:55:55] the reason for your sense. And so let's talk about, I'm sure there's people that reach out to you
[00:56:05] that go, I want to break into the luxury market. What are your thoughts on that? I see I always
[00:56:10] think most agents shouldn't aspire to that unless they want to up their game. Like you were saying,
[00:56:16] now dealing with buyers and sellers who maybe are a bit more sophisticated, maybe are just more
[00:56:22] business focused. Like you said, a lot of business owners, a lot of people who have been successful
[00:56:27] in their careers and just have a level of sophistication that maybe people at lower price points,
[00:56:33] just don't have or aren't as interested in. And so you do have to appeal to that sort of
[00:56:40] those qualities of these more sophisticated buyers and sellers. What would your advice to be to
[00:56:47] somebody that says, I want to sell $20 million homes just like you? You know what, I think people
[00:56:54] glamorize because of what's on TV selling. Sure. And mind all listening. And I think it's just
[00:56:59] like so easy when you go into a luxury market, the competition is at a different level.
[00:57:05] This is why I have to up my game. Like the only reason why I'm doing this because when I lose a
[00:57:11] listing, I'm like, all right, why did I lose that listing? What can I do better? Now I'm adding another
[00:57:17] piece to my arsenal, little by little, right? So, you know, being part of the Tom Ferry organization,
[00:57:23] I see people in much smaller markets selling $500,000 houses that they're making 10 times more than me.
[00:57:31] You know, so I think for an agent, you got to think about, is it about the glamour of selling
[00:57:38] luxury real estate or is it about the money? Because you can make more money selling $500,000 houses
[00:57:44] with, you know, obviously more units than selling luxury property and selling just, you know,
[00:57:50] five or, you know, or 10 listings or sales per year. And not having to spend $5,000 plus per listing
[00:57:56] to market it. Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. So again, like if you're dream, like for me, my dream was never
[00:58:03] to sell luxury real estate. Like that, I never, you know, got into real estate to be in Beverly Hills.
[00:58:08] It just kind of fell into my lap, right? My mom kind of pushed me. My girlfriend was living here.
[00:58:13] I got the, you know, I got this isn't positioned with the with Chad, I held him in high land. So
[00:58:17] everything kind of, you know, kind of just, you know, like the road kind of led me there, right?
[00:58:24] But it wasn't like I was like, I want to sell, you know, $20,000 listings, you know, that now I do,
[00:58:29] right? But, but before that, you know, it wasn't really a big deal. For those ages that really,
[00:58:34] really want to get into luxury real estate because they love those kinds of houses. They want to
[00:58:39] work with those kinds of people. That's great. You should do it. I think joining a team is obviously,
[00:58:45] I think, you know, having a mentor or joining a team should be the first thing you do,
[00:58:50] 100%. You have to learn about how, you know, what it takes to, to, to be a player,
[00:58:55] learn the players, learn the area, learn the markets, who are the buyers, who are the sellers, right?
[00:59:02] And then after that, create a plan. You know, how am I going to get, you know, open houses is
[00:59:07] great way of finding buyers, right? You know, co-calling, door knocking, I mean,
[00:59:13] there's so many stories out there. Santiago, Arana, door knock Brentwood for years,
[00:59:19] he's killing it. You know, the guys on Melendar listing, you know, Parns, you know, the
[00:59:25] the Bonsi brothers, they also door knock and bell air. So there's so many stories of people that are
[00:59:29] not even from LA and they want to do luxury real estate, but they, but they grinded their way in.
[00:59:35] You know, you got to grind your way and it's super, super competitive. So if you got, if you got
[00:59:40] what it takes and you're in your competitive and you're willing to grind, then go ahead and do it.
[00:59:44] Why not? I mean, anybody can do it. I did it. And everybody, you know, a lot of other people did it too.
[00:59:50] Well, I think that's really such an inspiring message. If we sort of look back at your entire
[00:59:55] career, yes, there were opportunities that allowed you to get introduced to different types of
[01:00:02] audiences that you now work with, but nothing was handed to you at all. You made your own luck
[01:00:09] by doing the things that maybe other agents wouldn't be willing to do. Even from starting,
[01:00:15] you know, with sending out 10,000 emails to other agents. And by the way, not being a guy who's a
[01:00:21] self-promoter, right? That is something you would think maybe a self-promoter or a schmoozer would want
[01:00:26] to do because it's a good networking sort of exercise. You were just like, I need to find a mentor here.
[01:00:31] And so you earnestly send out all these messages. And then, you know, everything, you continue to do
[01:00:38] things like that throughout your entire career. Continue to do it today. It's not like, oh, now it's
[01:00:43] just, I just get calls all day from developers and from luxury, you know, buyers and sellers.
[01:00:48] You're still drumming up all this business on your own. And I think that's just a great,
[01:00:54] a great place to sort of wrap up for today because it is, it's like, it reminds me of that old,
[01:01:01] well, this ancient, I think it's a zen saying, I can't remember exactly where it comes from. So,
[01:01:06] I apologize if I'm getting this wrong, but the expression's a good one, which is before enlightenment,
[01:01:11] chop wood, carry water, after enlightenment, chop wood, carry water. It's like, you just got to keep
[01:01:17] keep doing that, you know, the hard things because that's what keeps everything going. It's not like,
[01:01:24] you don't feel like you've arrived, so to speak, because you're still doing the same exact
[01:01:29] things. And that's oddly, but also absolutely makes sense of why you're continuing to be successful.
[01:01:36] And who knows, maybe one day it'll all just come come into you without without that much effort,
[01:01:42] but it's working for you. And it's a great reminder of just practicing the fundamentals and
[01:01:47] consistently applying those. Just the same way we built our podcast here. It wasn't any one
[01:01:52] interview that got us, you know, yeah, it's just just consistency in talking to people like yourself.
[01:01:58] And what you shared was really super inspiring today. So I hope, I don't even hope, I know our
[01:02:05] audiences received a tremendous amount of benefit for any agents out there who might be might have
[01:02:12] clients that are moving to, you know, to the more exclusive areas of LA and the suburbs and are
[01:02:19] looking, you know, maybe they don't service that particular area. Maybe they're in a different state,
[01:02:23] but they have clients who maybe have second, third, fourth homes, and they maybe want to partner with
[01:02:27] a top agent like yourself. Or if there's, you know, anyone who is in the Beverly Hills and
[01:02:34] surrounding areas who's a buyer seller, investor developer or renter who wants to work with you
[01:02:39] directly, you know, what's the best way that one of our listeners could reach out to you?
[01:02:43] Call me, text me email me Instagram. I check all those things. So like myself on 310-387-1976.
[01:02:52] You know, call me, shoot me a text email Paul at PaulSalazarGroup.com. Instagram at PaulSalazarGroup.
[01:03:02] So it's very easy to get in touch with me. I've actually, you know, been, you know, I've had
[01:03:08] people reach out to me to ask for advice. I always, you know, give them a few minutes of my time to,
[01:03:13] because I listen, I respect that. You know, I was there at one point and I respect people that
[01:03:18] like go out there and reach out and like, you know, want to ask for advice. I've actually given, like,
[01:03:24] there's a kid in high school that sent me a long email saying he wants me to mentor him.
[01:03:30] I bought him to my open house. Now he helps me out with things. It's like it, when you put yourself
[01:03:35] out there, the world is going to give you gifts, you know, and I think a lot of people don't put
[01:03:43] themselves out there because it feels vulnerable. You got to get uncomfortable. You got to be
[01:03:47] durable. And the more vulnerable you get, the more uncomfortable you get, the more difficult
[01:03:51] things you do, the more you start to feel like empowered by yourself. Like, wow, I can do that.
[01:03:56] You know, I think that's probably my biggest tip for any listener here. Just start doing small
[01:04:02] things every single day that are that are difficult, you know, take a cold shower in the morning,
[01:04:07] waking up early, working out in the morning, making a, you know, one cold cold, door knocking one
[01:04:13] door, you know, going out and just meeting somebody, striking up a conversation. And you start
[01:04:19] to realize that, wow, why am I even worried about that? Why was I scared about that? You know,
[01:04:25] there's, we just have these, these fears because, you know, we've had this, it's a human condition,
[01:04:32] right? Sure. But once you get over this, then you start to get more empowered and you start to do
[01:04:37] more and more difficult things. Like, I still have a lot of things that I want to do that are,
[01:04:40] that are difficult, that I'm still, you know, getting too little by little.
[01:04:44] Cold showers is such a great example of a small thing that anybody can try. And it is
[01:04:52] shockingly difficult. It's more difficult than you think it's going to be thinking about it now.
[01:04:56] It's actually two times harder than what you're even thinking. And if you can, if you, I want everybody
[01:05:02] to try this tomorrow, and it's not because having a cold shower in and of itself is anything,
[01:05:06] it's the idea of it. And people say there's some health benefits, whatever that may or may not be.
[01:05:12] But what there definitely is a benefit is you, if you can make it 30 seconds, 60 seconds,
[01:05:17] and complete it, you will feel as much jubilation as if you just ran a marathon because it is
[01:05:24] that difficult. And that is an easy win. It's not an easy one. It's a very difficult win. If you can
[01:05:29] do that daily, I promise, just do it, try it once tomorrow, try to make it 10 seconds on ice cold,
[01:05:34] all the way to cold. It's tough. I did it for about a year. I need to get back into it. I
[01:05:40] did it many years ago, took me months to find the courage to do it. Months and months and months.
[01:05:45] And it sounds silly. I know I'm just talking about this one specific thing. But it's a something
[01:05:49] that you will, again, you will feel unbelievable as you walk out of that shower. You'll be like,
[01:05:55] I just did something crazy hard. And you're right. Then other things, which maybe aren't quite as
[01:06:02] difficult, don't seem as bad as they did before. So, oh my gosh, what a great thing. So do hard
[01:06:08] things, people that are healthy, do hard things that are healthy. And Paul, what a great, great place
[01:06:14] to wrap up. So everyone, go, please, Paul's a wonderful guy. Reach out to him if you need some
[01:06:19] his systems. Also, if you have clients that are moving to the Southern California, talk to Paul,
[01:06:24] he wants to chat with you. And he certainly is a great REALTOR to have in your in your database.
[01:06:30] And Paul, on behalf of our audience, thank you so much for coming on our show. This is such a
[01:06:35] such a pleasure to have you. And if I fiver make it out to to to L.A., I haven't been there in
[01:06:40] many years. I need to come back. I want to say hi to you in person and and see you in action.
[01:06:46] That would be fun. And on people on behalf of Paul, myself, I want to thank everyone for making
[01:06:50] it to the end of the episode. Please do us do do us one favor. This is a bit an amazing episode.
[01:06:55] I want everybody to think of one other REALTOR that needs to hear what Paul had to say. And just
[01:07:00] send them a link to our either this episode or a website, which is keeping it real pod.com.
[01:07:04] You will help somebody by sending this to some struggling agent in your office, or maybe,
[01:07:09] you know, another agent from a different office that you know that could use, you know, this sort of
[01:07:14] this sort of past sort of pep talk from somebody who started with really no major help
[01:07:20] and built this incredible career and is really just getting started. And it'll be inspiring to
[01:07:25] to everybody else who'll be actually helping people do that and you're helping us as well. So
[01:07:28] please send a link to this episode other than that. Paul, I am so excited to continue to watch
[01:07:33] your journey. And thank you so much for being on the podcast. And we'll see everybody on the next
[01:07:38] episode. Thanks, Paul. Thank you, Jay. Appreciate it.

Wow, that was quite the intro there. Well, it's so funny. I was feeling weird hearing all that stuff. Yeah, right. It is weird. I had somebody recently interviewed me, which very rarely happens. And they went through list of things like I was just mentioning you. And I was like, well, I don't like to hear that at all. It just doesn't sound right for somebody. I know, it feels weird. I mean, it's great, but it also feels weird. Well, I would love to talk about all of how you got into luxury. But also, let's start at the very beginning of your real estate sort of journey. How did you get into real estate and why? OK, so let's start from college, right? Because let's start from like my culture. I'm Colombian. And almost everybody in my family they have their own business. They're entrepreneurs. My dad, my brothers, my cousins. And uncles, right? So it's kind of in our blood to have our own thing. Not to have a boss. Not to be told what to do, right? So that's one. Two is that in college, I finished college on a study abroad program called semester at C. And that was my last semester of college. I finished that and then I went into the real world and I was like, what am I going to do? Like I just finished traveling in the world with a bunch of college kids, having a blast, drinking, party, traveling, literally, circumnavigating the entire globe. And I was pretty depressed. I got to tell you I was not in a good place. I was working with my dad. He has his own business. But I knew I didn't want to be in his business. But I also knew I didn't want to have like a regular nine to five job, right? So I'm like, what am I going to do? I don't really have any capital to start a business. My mom was in real estate at Century 21 Beach. I went to the countryside in Rancho Cucamanga, which is where I went to high school, and which is where I lived while I was commuting back and forth to college at UC Riverside. So I would say about three months after semester at C, I had a few interviews with some regular nine to five jobs. And it just wasn't clicking for me. And then my mom came into my room. I vividly remember this day. And she used to call me Babito. So she's like, Babito, why don't you come sell real estate with me? And this is in 06, right? So the market is still on fire. She's doing the perfect time to get in, 06. Yeah, yeah. She doing really well. She's traveling. She's selling a bunch of real estate. I'm like, that sounds good. I was like, all right. I was like, yeah, sure. Let's do it. And so that's how I started to get into real estate is selling real estate in Rancho Cucamango for a sentient 21 beach set. Wow. And you came in at such an interesting time. I actually bought my first condo in 2006. And upon retrospect, maybe not the ideal time for me to have bought a condo. Of course, none of us really knew that back then. It wasn't like the writing was so obviously on the wall, of course. But so you started towards the end of that boom. And what was it like starting off in 2006? You know, I'm very grateful that I got at least the year of decent market under my belt of doing transactions with my mom as I'm learning the business, right? I also helped enhance her business as well, because I had a business background in college, right? Which helped a little bit, let's be honest. You don't really learn a lot in college, at least specific to real estate. But I think I was able to use what I learned in college to help her grow her business. And so we created the Salazar team. Those team Salazar, that was the name of our team, just me and her. And we had like a part time assistant. And again, I'm very grateful I didn't start in 08, because I probably wouldn't have made it. And I probably wouldn't have still be in the business. So it allowed me to stay in the business to have some money saved up for the rainy days of 2008 through 2012, right? So again, very, very grateful for it. But at the same time, I was selling very small properties, you know, $200,000 properties, $300,000. Every once in a while we'll break a $500,000 property. And I was really excited about that. But it was great. I'm getting very, very grateful for the opportunity that my mom gave me. Yeah, it's a really good opportunity to be able to work with somebody who's established, who's successful. And also you get to learn. So I imagine your mom was, I imagine, a pretty great mentor to you. She was. And we've always had a really great relationship. And I was living, you know, so my parents were divorced already. So it was just me and her in the house. So again, if you're starting real estate and you have like a bunch of bills and debt, it's really hard because it takes about three to six months, maybe a year to get, you know, get going. So living at home really allowed me to, I had very, very little bills, you know, maybe the $1,000, maybe $2,000 a month, which is nothing, right? And retrospect, you know? So if I closed one big deal, big being, you know, $300,000 or something like that, I would keep $5,000 and I would have enough money for like three months. And that's what I would do. I would save up the money and I knew I had enough money to last me another six months. And then I just kept on growing that nest egg to a year to two years. And I just kind of kept on growing from there. Wow. And at what point did you decide to make a shift from working with your mom or working in Rancho Cucamanga? And then, you know, making a shift to where you are now? Yeah. So, so, you know, the crash happened at the end of 07 in 08, right? I started selling some short sales. That's what kind of kept me kind of going is just selling short sales, right? And my mom always pushed me, she's like, Bapito, you can always sell, you know, luxury properties. Like, why don't you go out there and do like Beverly Hills and like start selling some luxury properties? And to me, I always had doubts, you know, like my mindset wasn't there. Like, I was like, I don't think I can do that. I don't know anybody there. I don't know the market there. I don't have any connections. And even though we live only an hour away, but I could be from Ohio. I'd be the same thing. You know, like another universe almost, yeah, a completely different universe. And I had no connections. Like, I literally knew nobody that lived in that area. My whole family was in Rancho or Pasadena or in this area, right? So at the time, my girlfriend lived in Brentwood, which is like West, West LA, the West Side, right? And so I was commuting back and forth, right? And my mom had gone to Columbia in 2000, at the beginning of 2009, or actually or 2008 or something like that. And she had met her now husband, right? So it was a perfect transition. She's like, she had called me and she was on vacation for like a month in Columbia. And she's like, hey, I wanted to let you know that I met some guy in it. Like my heart dropped. It's like we even met some guy, you know, in Columbia. And she's like, yeah, I met some guy in Columbia and, you know, of course, being the son and, you know, she's being the boss. I was very protective. Sure. I was like, I don't know about this mom. She was like, yeah, we're going to get it. Like think about getting married. I'm like, you just met the guy like a month ago, you know? So, but it ended up working out, right? So since I was commuting back and forth, my mom had now planned to move to Columbia to go live with her now husband. It was a perfect transition for me to be like, you know what? Let me move to LA. Let me try it out. You know, give it a shot. I had saved enough money for about six months of living in LA, right? So my plan was I moved to LA to downtown LA, so which is kind of like not in Beverly Hills or not in the West Side where I live now. But kind of like a like a middle ground because like all my friends and family still live in Rancho, right? So I didn't want to be too far away from them as well. So I moved to downtown LA with with my best friend from college. And we got to place together and I didn't have a job. I moved to LA without having a job. And I said, I said to myself, do I want to start selling real estate? It's going to take me a while to get going. I don't have a budget to market myself. I don't know anybody. I don't know any of the markets. I don't know any of the areas. I don't know anything about the market, right? So I was starting from scratch. I knew how to I had a close at that time, probably about 30 deals, 30 or 40 deals with my mom over the last couple of years, the last three years. So I knew about the transaction, right? But I didn't know about the players. I didn't know about how to sell luxury real estate, which is completely different than selling a house that's worth, you know, $200, $300,000. So so she moved to Columbia in 2009. I moved to downtown LA and I said, you know what, what I should do is I should probably work underneath a top agent, right? So I emailed my resume to about, you know, 10,000 agents. I downloaded all the emails. Smart. I love that all the emails from the MLS and I had emailed and I was, I emailed every single person, right? I got I got a bunch of interviews. I got about 17 interviews, you know, and my last interview was a call with Chad Rogers, who was at the time on a million dollar listing on Bravo. He was one of the original cast members. And he was working at Hilton in Highland. And when I've doing my research, I'm like, this is the best firm in LA, one of the best firms in the world. I really want to be at this firm, you know, and I had gotten no calls from anybody at Hilton in Highland. The last call I got was from Chad. He called me. He left a message and he's like, yeah, I'm on million dollar listing. I'm like, I have no idea who you are. I don't watch the show. Right? Which he actually liked, right? So yeah, sure. Called them. Yeah. Because you weren't, you didn't want to hang out with him because he was on TV. Exactly. So, so I called him up. We had an interview and it was a match. It was perfect. So and, and, you know, I, you know, I have to give a lot of, you know, of, of gratitude and a lot of credit to Chad for giving me the opportunity to be working under him because he was selling big properties, you know, you know, 15, 18, 20, 21, 22, 23, 23 million dollar properties. So because of him, I was able to get into the luxury market. And I stayed with him for a long time, for about 10 years. I should have left earlier. And I think the reason why I didn't leave is because again, my mindset wasn't there. I didn't feel that I, I can, I could, I could sell real estate on my own, you know. Right. So Chad really taught me how to, how to deal with these high net worth individuals. How to deal with business managers, how to deal with, how to deal with lawyers, how the transaction worked, how to list properties in this, in these areas, you know, and his, his community was Malibu colony. And if you're not familiar with Malibu colony, it's, it's only 120 houses right on the beach in Malibu. It's a gated community. Sting lives there. Jason stayed in Pamela, Anderson. I mean, so many celebrities call this place home and his, his, his family owned a house there. So he grew up in this, in this community. So most of the deals that we, that we did were in this community. So I really got to know all the big players from, from working with him, you know, the only thing, the only downside with working with Chad is that he already had a network, right. So he wasn't really out there prospecting like I do nowadays. Sure. So I really didn't learn the business side of real estate through Chad. I just learned how to, how to talk to people that are lawyers or CEOs, or billionaires, right. I learned how to communicate with these kind of people because he would, he would give me a deal. Like he would say, hey, Paul, this is my listing and I would take it on from there. Like I, I did most of the work. I really helped him on his business. And, and we did well together and we did well together. And, and I think, I think after, after 10 years, I think what, what, what helped me make that transition from, you know, the mindset was just like, I, I, again, I just didn't feel I guess worthy enough or I didn't feel I had the capability of going on my own. Like I feel like I needed somebody to help me out, you know. And I so, I started to listen to like, to like some podcasts and Tom Ferries podcast really kind of resonated with me. Sure. Really loved to hear what he had to say. And I started to listen to him, you know, he's like, he was, he was talking about cold calling. And I was like, I've never cold called in my, you know, at this time, I think I was in the business for about 13 years. And I never cold called once in my entire career. And, and probably didn't want to either. You're probably like, I don't want to have to do that. Yeah. I, yeah, exactly. I, it's like, it was really scary for me. And at that time when I was working with Chad, I was his assistant. And then after a couple of years, it was like a hybrid model. And we also actually had an assistant. So as me, him and we had an assistant. So he would give me deals. I would hold his open houses. I would get a deals through, through that. I would get deals now through some like friendships that I had in, in LA. So I kind of started to grow my business, but I didn't really grow that, that, that big. That's why I was also scared to leave him because I didn't really have big, you know, a big source of business because I would also get like a, like a, like a small percentage of his business as well. But if I left him, I wouldn't be getting that anymore. Right. So that's how it started, you know, it's, um, it was a long, it was a long journey, which had, I learned a lot. I should have left earlier, like probably after five years, but I didn't. And, um, after, you know, listening to Tom, Tom's podcast for about three months, I joined his coaching program. And after that, I started cold calling. I got a couple of my own listings and then I left chat right after that. Wow. I, so I have a few questions. I want to go actually, um, thank you. That is a really incredible story. And there's more to the story. I know, um, I want to go back to just this really smart idea that in all the episodes, we've done, I don't think anyone has ever suggested and it was a really good idea. Because they're so obviously teams are, or whether or not you want to be a solo practitioner or a team, having a mentor, regardless, is a great idea for so many listeners. So Paul did something very creative and something that literally anybody can do, which is he got, he, well, in your case, you scraped a list of off the MLS of REALTOR emails. He can also buy these lists. They're really not that expensive. A couple hundred bucks, maybe for your local area. And then he just, you know, fired out 10,000 emails and that is absolutely doable. So if anyone out there is listening, um, that is essentially how Paul got to into luxury property. He, he invested in reaching out to everyone in his local area and got 17 interviews. And I mean, it's, it is, it is remarkable. I was just talking to one of the very top producers here in Chicago. Yesterday, and I was asking her how often, and she's a solo practitioner. And she does about 160 million a year, just herself alone. And yeah, she's amazing. And she, I was like, how often do people email, do REALTORS email you asking for mentorship, coaching, she's like, oh, and she's super nice and very sweet. She's like almost never. So it's one of those things that I guess sometimes we think maybe those people are getting inundated and maybe they are, but maybe they're not. And so I just wanted to honor you for, for, for sort of being creative in that step. I've never heard of anyone doing that. Now that's what us recruiters do. We get those lists. Yeah. What do we recruit REALTORS? So recruiters do this all the time. But individual agents, unless, unless it's like, oh, I have, I have a listing and I want to, I want to email every REALTOR to let them know about it. That's another reason why sometimes people do it. But as far as like to find a mentor or a partner, boy, what a smart idea. So again, I just wanted to step on that a little bit because I think it was a really, really smart play. The other thing too, I want to talk about so many of our listeners and, and I've obviously, you know, people who are your peers are probably like, how do you get into luxury? Well, you just told the story of how you got introduced to that world. But then there's that whole step of like, I didn't grow up in Malibu. I didn't, I don't, I didn't grow up in this gated community of 120 homes where everybody knows me because those are my neighbors. And that's what I grew up with. And, and yes, you were introduced to that world. But then it is this pretty big shift of like, I'm going to cut the cord and try to build my own business. And, and he said, looking back, you know, maybe you stayed longer than, then you needed to. But that does require a massive mine shift change to say, okay, I can, I can survive and thrive in that world, even though that isn't my background. It isn't necessarily what I, what I've known my whole life. So I'm curious on what you learned with Tom Ferry's coaching program, which everybody who listens, probably knows who Tom Ferry is. If not, he's, he's an, he's incredible. His dad, Mike Ferry is kind of a famous guy in the, in the, in the coaching movement. Brian Bafini's another guy. So it's usually Mike Ferry, Brian Bafini and Tom Ferry are kind of like the three biggest names. And all three of them have, have really great stuff to offer. Tom Ferry has kind of, kind of having his moment the last like 10 years. He's kind of a bit the guy who's, everyone's kind of paying attention to. But what did you learn from, from Tom's coaching, you know, coaching partners about how to shift your mindset? I mean, so much, right? I mean, there are so many different tips that, that, that he kind of suggested, you know, affirmations, some books, right? But I, I think for me, I think the biggest shift was, at the time, I, you know, I was, I was single. And I had just started dating this girl, who is now my girlfriend, and she was an entrepreneur, you know, and she was out there, you know, you know, just like putting herself out there, you know? And I wasn't doing that. And so she, she really kind of inspired me to be like, you know, I can do more, right? Like I can, I can do more with myself. Like I don't, I don't, I don't need somebody else to help me. I can do it on my own, you know, and it's, it's, I think I, I don't know if there was one thing I think it was just kind of listening to his podcast and all, actually, the interviews, just like this, this kind of interview that like Tom would do and the interviews that, that, that you do DJ are so important because they allow the listeners to get inspired to hear the stories because to me, those stories really helped me be like, wow, that person did it, that person did it. And now I started to say, why can't I do it, you know? So those stories really helped me out. And when I was rich had, I, I wasn't really into the business, like I was more traveling, I was partying. So I wasn't really focused on my career. I was really more focused on just having a good time, to be honest. Sure. And, you know, since I had a girlfriend, I had more time to kind of focus on my career instead of, you know, traveling and doing all these other things, right? But I think hearing the stories was really the most important thing for me in kind of shifting the mindset, right? Because I heard all these stories of all these other amazing agents that started from nothing or they, you know, didn't have anything or it, there was, you know, everybody has their own story, right? And some stories I can't relate to as much as as other stories, right? So like, like I may relate to certain people, but I may not relate to other people, right? Sure. But, but, but listening to those interviews was my favorite thing. And, and to this day, I still love to hear those interviews because I learned so much about what these people do, how they grew their business. And I always take one or two things and I implement that in my business. I want to pause for a moment to talk about our episode sponsor, our one of my favorite companies out there, follow up boss.

Yeah, well, boy, that's exactly our goal on the show. So I'm glad that that worked for you because you know, it's funny. I was thinking like, oh, it would be really fun to have Chad on the show and it probably wouldn't. I'm sure he's an um, he would be excellent. But the moment people here, oh, like if I say, how'd you get into luxury? He's like, well, but you know, I grew up in this area that, you know, that's a immediately when a lot of our listeners would be like, oh, okay. Well, I didn't, I didn't grow up in an environment like that. So yes, easy for that guy. And of course, it isn't necessarily easy if just because you grow up in that environment, but it is not as relatable, right? And so I love that you that that you sort of infiltrated it in a good way and sort of went, oh, I belong here. I can thrive in this environment and just learning how to communicate and maybe with people who are in that ultra high net worth space and understanding their needs, understanding what the goals of people like that who I imagine there's people, you have clients that probably have whole teams of people that you have to meet with financial people, accountants, attorneys, agents, whoever it might be. It's not, I imagine it's not just usually like one single buyer and one seller and then the agents on either side. So what would you say? So anyway, just to continue on in your story. So you decided, you know, you got the courage to kind of go off on on your own, cut the cord. And then, you know, did you feel at that point that you had made enough headway into your your sphere of influence that you were able to sort of survive that way? You know, I again, I think I've always had enough money to survive six or 12 months. And I think that's an important thing for agents to hear, right? And I don't have any kids, right? I don't have any kids yet. So it's easier for me to to grow that like nest egg, right? Just for me. But you know, for for anybody else, everybody knows how much they need every single month to be able to say, you know, what if I'm going to go into a new business or to a new venture, I have this much time to to actually excel before I'm like, you know, broke, right? So I've always been comfortable in that regards where, you know, I could have again, I could have left, you know, five years before leaving Chad, you know, because I had that money, I just didn't have the courage, right? So for me, it was luckily, the coach I had was very inspiring too. Her name is Mary Jett, she is now the head of all coaches at Tom Ferry. She is an amazing person. She is like, she's just like a mom, you know, and she was coaching John Grommon, who was like one of the top agents in the in the in the nation. She was coaching Gary Gold, who saw the the playboy mentioned who was at hillton in Highland. And Gary was actually the one who recommended me to Mary Jett, you know, so I again, very grateful to Gary Gold, who's now a co-op banker, because I call him, I said, Hey, Gary, I know that you're coaching with Tom Ferry. And when I'm doing, you know, all my research is like, yeah, you know, call my coach Mary Jett. So I call Mary Jett. She's and she's like, Hey, you know, why don't I send you, you know, three or four recommendations here at the Tom Ferry coaching, you know, network that that may be able to assist you. I talked to those coaches, but I didn't have the same connection that I have with Mary Jett, you know. So I call Mary Jett again. I said, Hey, Mary Jett, I know you're busy. I know you have a lot of clients. I'm very coachable. I am ready to go and please coach me, because I know that you have, you know, what it takes to help me grow my business. And she said, you know, what Paul, let's do it. And so again, so so grateful for Mary, because she actually really inspired me to leave Chad. She didn't push me. She inspired me. That's the difference. I did it on my own. She was actually shocked. After two months of being coached by her, I left Chad. And then three months later, I hired my first assistant. Wow. Yeah. And you know, so what I, what I'm really hearing is she gave you the courage to bet on yourself. Yeah. Yeah. And it's, it's funny too, because betting on yourself is a very scary endeavor, even for the most confident person, because it also could, could not go well. And, and in your case, you know, you really have to commit, and you did, and, and you made it work. So, so you, you left, you found the courage to do that. Your coach, of course, helped you, you know, change your mindset to this like you can do this, but also I'm not going to push you to do it. It's a decision you have to make on your own, whether you do it or not. I'm still your coach. And, and, and, and you did it. And, and then, and then how did things, you know, blossom from there? Well, so again, I didn't have a network, even though I've been in LA for a long time, you know, I think my network was really outside of LA, you know, I, I had a small network in LA from, you know, just kind of meeting people, you know, going out and whatnot. But I really didn't, I, I'm not really a networker, you know, that's not how I get my business, right? And a lot of people in LA that are successful actually are good networkers, but that's not me. I don't like to go out at night and like smooth. That's not my thing. So when I was, you know, listening to how other agents, you know, grow their business, you know, co-calling expires was a great way to grow the business. So I started, I started co-calling expires, you know, and it was, that was so hard for me to start doing that. And I actually started co-calling expires. I think before I hired Mary J at the top-right organization. And then I hired her. But I basically started co-calling expires every single day. And I was horrible at it. And I was so, I was so nervous getting on the phone. Like it was like traumatizing for me. I'm just like, and my girlfriend is like, why, you know, what's, like what's going on? And she's also a coach herself, you know? So she was kind of coaching me through this whole process. But again, it was just like the mindset. Like I just wasn't there. And I didn't have, I guess, I don't have the confidence yet to really co-call these people. And when you're co-calling, you know, two, three, four, five, and plus million dollar houses, they're getting calls from everybody in their mind. Everybody. I mean, like people from like, like an hour away are calling them. It's nuts. So you were only calling luxury expires. Or were you okay? So you somehow subscribed? Did you subscribe to a service that gives you those leads? Or did you just find them in the MLS as they would expire? So at the time I was using red X. I'm now using Vulkan. But at the time I was using red X. And I think there's like a filter of doing like only houses over a million dollars. So I was only, I mean, like listen, anything in LA right now, anything over a million dollars is like, like a, like a tear down, you know? Yeah. So it's like, like the word luxury, it's like, I don't even know what that means anymore. Because here, here in LA is a two million dollar property, like a luxury property, because it's like a three bedroom two bath, 1200 square foot house, and a okay neighborhood. It's insane, right? So, so with that being said, you know, I started calling expires. And by the way, I want to pause you for a second because for those of you that have never, I feel like that art of calling per sale by owners, calling expired listings, isn't as popular anymore. Well, first of all, people, you know, look, most people don't like making cold calls. And calling per sale by owners or expires is, we'll say just expires expires, particularly difficult because it was on the market probably with another REALTOR. It didn't go well. It didn't property didn't transact. And so you may, you may be calling somebody who now hates REALTORS or hates the previous REALTOR or, and as you said, is also because it's a luxury property, at least by the price, it is now, you know, very attractive to everyone who buys these leads, which is a lot of agents. So you're right, people from an hour away, sure, I'll drive in for a $2 million property, of course. So now the owner is getting bombarded with you're probably not the first phone call, even of the day, when you call them. So, so can you just talk a little bit about what those calls were like just because I love the fact that you started calling fizz bows and and or sorry, I've expired listings and we're able to, you know, still still build a luxury practice out of it. Yeah, I mean, I, I knew that like that was really the only way that I wanted to do things because like, I'm not a, I'm not a networker, that's not my thing. Sure. I'm not going out at nighttime and going to events, right? So I like to be home, you know, during the week. So it's either open houses, door knocking or expires. And I still don't have the courage to go to go door knocking yet. So I started with expires, right? That was the, that was my first step into building my confidence into doing scary things. And a book that I like to read that really inspired me was a miracle morning. Oh, yeah. How how L run? Yeah. Yes, exactly. Great book. So highly recommend it for any for any listeners. So me and my girlfriend started doing that. So we started waking up early in a 545 alarm, getting up at five, you know, meditation, journal, workouts. There's a couple of other things there. I forgot what they are. But, but doing that every single morning and then that really propels you to a very successful day, you know. So I started doing that, but making the calls was really tough, you know, the good thing is that I knew the market. So that was one. I knew the market, which is really important. And number two, I was at a great brokerage, Hilton and Highland. And we only have one office and only 150 agents. So it was only really, in my office, there's only one other agent that that does expired calls. So if I'm calling, hey, it's Paul Salas or at Hilton and Highland, I kind of not not everybody, but most people will know that that brand name and they'll say, you know what, there's only a few agents at that, at that brokerage. It's a very, very popular brokerage here in the area for Highland residential. And so they gave me a little bit more respect, right? That's nice. So that definitely helped me out. Okay. But at the end of the day, you just have to know how, you know, you obviously have to have a script that you internalized. You have to know it from, you know, you have to just understand the script. There's only going to be a few different objections. And you have to know how to handle it. And more importantly, it's your tonality. Yes. That's what I learned. It's tonality is so important, right? And everybody's different. I'm really good with a certain demographic. Ladies that are like 60 plus, you know, I just went to my first listing. And you know, it was a, it was a, it was a 2.1 million dollar listing. And they had interviewed the other agent at my office who was like the king of expires in L.A. Who does a ton of expires. And I actually beat him, I beat him to the listing, which is great. And, and the way I did it was just like, I was just personable. And, and I, you know, and what I started to create after that was how do I become the best listing agent in L.A. What do I have to do to become the best listing agent in L.A. So that was really my mindset going forward is how do I create, you know, a great listing, right? So what does that involve? And how do I also show my next prospect how I just transformed this property, sold it for record price, you know, you know, short data market was on market for six months, I sold it in a weekend, you know, so I started to, to, to create those marketing pieces to help me get the next listing and the next listing and the next listing. And I started just to, just really hone in on my listing skills and my negotiation skills and my sales skills to really go from expired to sold, you know, and I have, I have like, you know, like 15 now case studies of these houses that were once on the market, I transformed them and I was able to get them sold. You know, that's, that's such a great approach. This idea of sort of what we would maybe call storytelling, this idea of, hey, let me tell you about this previous thing versus here's why I'm the best choice, which I'm sure you do have that as part of your pitch as well of like here's what I'm going to do for you. Here's the x, y and z of what I'm going to do. But let me tell you about this last property I just worked on. Here's what I did to that. Here's the result. And, you know, you're sort of sharing that, that whole journey to somebody. And that's a very powerful approach that I suspect a lot of agents don't think that way. It's more like, hey, if you look at my reputation, if you look at what I, what I do in general, I'm a big deal, or, you know, without saying I'm a big deal. Whereas you're telling very specific stories of previous experiences you have. And that is, it's a very unique approach, actually. I think that's, that's quite, quite smart. And obviously started resonating with these, with these expires. And honestly, like because of expires, like that's what helped me grow my business. Like it's because of expires. Because, you know, from there, you hold open houses, you find buyers from there, you go doorknock the neighborhood from there, you start just started little by little, start building your business. And, you know, like, I, I, again, I think 60% of my business right now is still expired, still new business. Because I don't have enough old business to get repeat clients. I don't, I don't have the like, like the luxury of being like, hey, Paul, you sold my property two years ago, I want to buy something like I rarely get those calls, maybe two or three times a year. Obviously, as I grow my business, like I'm getting more and more of those calls, but I still cannot rely on that. I still rely on circle dialing on door knocking, on sending mailers, on calling expires, and doing open houses. Let's talk about door knocking because so few of our guests on, I've had a few guests that have that have talked about door knocking. I suspect more, more have done it. Maybe just don't talk about it. But that is also, I think, a very courageous thing to do. And it's very difficult. So as you, you know, tell us your approach for door knocking just, you know, are you, are you door knocking in neighborhoods where you just, or you're currently selling a property or just sold a property, oh, by the way, I just, you know, I helped your neighbor down the street just wanted to introduce myself that kind of thing or how, how did you go about doing that? Well, I have a geo farm, right? So here here in Venice, in the West Side, Venice Beach, I have like a, you know, like a 500, you know, home, you know, community that I'm constantly working on, right? So that's, that's how I started door knocking, right? And again, this is all from Tom Ferry, Mary Jett saying, hey, you have to have a, you have to have four lead pillars. One is, you know, so when I first started coaching with them, it was geo farm, expires, open houses, and then my past clients, which is very, very little, right? So, so, you know, door knocking to me is the most effective way of prospecting. Hands down. Wow. You can't beat it. More effective than it calling expires. More, it just takes a lot of time and effort and energy. And that's why people don't do it because it's like, you have to go out there, you have to have like a marketing piece, you have to go and doorknoc. It's like, it's a, it's a lot of time and effort. You know, co-calling is a little bit easier. You're at home. You could be in your PJs. You could just, you know, get out of bed and do it, right? But when you're door knocking, you have to, you know, I have to shave, I've got to look good. I got to look presentable. I got to, I got to understand the market in this little area. But, you know, I've, from one of my door knocking deals, this is actually during COVID, right? Where I couldn't actually doork, but I was still passing out flyers. And if somebody was out in the front of the door, I was, you know, like, if they're out in the yard, I would talk to them. So funny story is like, I wanted to start, I wanted to get into selling new developments because Santiago Arana, who is one of the biggest agents in the nation, he's here in Brentwood. Actually, you know, he actually interviewed me when I first came to LA in 2009. He didn't hire me, but he's a great agent, you know, like, he, like, I always look up to him because he's kind of like me, like he's a, you know, Latin guy like me. He came from nothing and he's built an amazing business. I mean, he's a, he's a freaking baller, right? But he built his business on door knocking and, he found a lot of tear downs and he was able to sell those two developers and then the developer built a 20, 30, 40, 50 million dollar house. And now he's selling those houses, right? So that's another great way of getting the luxury space if you're in an area where there's a lot of tear downs and development opportunities, right? Is to start, you know, door knocking those houses, finding those sellers, finding the developers, which is super easy, right? So that was one of my first development deals a few years ago was during COVID, walking around in my geo farm. I knew, I picked this geo farm because it had a lot of tear down potential. And a tear down is going to be three deals, three sides, right? You rep the seller who's selling the development opportunity, you rep the developer and then you rep the developer when they sell it. And a good chance that you get a lead out of it or a buyer and you double end it. So there's a possibility for four sides and one one deal there, right? So there's a really, you know, really, you know, good chance that you can make some good money on these on these tear downs. So anyway, so I was door knocking. I met the, the older couple, they were super sweet. They knew nothing about real estate at all. Their father just had passed away. So it was a trust sell. They had to they had to pay no capital gain. So it was perfect for them. They were going to cash out. I found a great developer that I now have sold multiple deals to. And, you know, and that's how I kind of started, right? Now selling brand new developments was just by door knocking these houses. And this idea of cold calling developers not to, hey, I want to rep your next project, which, of course, every REALTOR would want that too. But you're saying, hey, I've got a deal for you essentially, not a deal. I've got a transaction possibly for you. Not a deal is in like, I've got a special offer for you. But I've got this property that that you might be interested in Mr. and Mrs. developer. I've never heard of anybody doing that. I don't know why that has never been talked about that is a brilliant approach to giving providing value to a developer to which they're like, hey, this guy's great. He's given us business. We're going to use him for, you know, maybe other things we're doing. Yeah, for sure. And I think my pitch to these sellers that own these tear downs and there's not all properties are going to be considered tear downs, you know. Sure. I always look out for my clients, no matter what. I always look out like if I was them, what would I do? Right? There's some houses that you can slap some paint on it, change some countertops, and we'll talk about that a little bit later on because I also specialize in like refurbishing a house, you know, redoing a house and selling it to an end user, right? But there's certain houses that you can't do that. It's either too small or it needs too much work and it's a perfect tear down, right? Like the developer is going to pay more than an end user, right? So what my pitches to these sellers is that I'm going to create an offering memorandum in OM, right? And that's not really used for residential brokers. They don't really understand what that means. That's for commercial agents, you know, that's our industrial buildings or office and retail or other kind of commercial real estate. So what I do is that I create it with my team like a 15, 20 page PDF and it outlines, right? This is what we're selling. This is what we're asking, you know, this is, you know, what the what the land, you know, price per square foot because we don't look at price per square foot for the house. We look at the price per square foot for the land. We show them comps of other other land sales that are similar to this in the area. We also show them comps of what a new development will sell for in the area. We also show them what they can build per the underbuilt report, which is a company here in the area that can tell me how big of a house I can build and then I email it to developers and then say give me a call. I say give me a call and now they they trust me even more because I created this great marketing piece that took me three hours and they trust me. This guy is a real deal, right? And so I start calling these developers. I said, hey, and it's so easy to find developers. So there's no excuse for anybody not to find developer. All you do is you go on the MLS, you find out all the new developments that are sold, you look at public records, you saw who sold them. If it's an LLC, you look up the LLC, you look at the manager, you you find them online, they have a website, you give them a call, it literally takes five minutes, right? It's super, super easy. So that's how it started and I luckily sold it to a great developer who I have a great relationship now and now I've already sold them a few other properties that are now being built. And that house, I sold it originally tear down for 1.6 million. So I double end that and then we sold it two months ago for 4.2 million. And and we put a big sign in front of the house as as they were building it, you know, as they were, you know, building the whole house, a huge sign, a massive sign with a QR code to a like a website and I got I got a buyer lead that I sold another house for 3.1 million. I got other leads that I'm working on right now. So it's like every single listing should give you two or three deals at the minimum one deal and if you really know how to maximize it, two or three deals. So that's why I really focus on getting listings. How many other agents do you know who prospect developers with with opportunities like that you put together? I'm curious if that's a common practice and if it is, I'm curious on how putting together that 1520 page PDF with literally step by step of like here's all the work we've done here's the options for what you can do, Mr. Mrs. Developer. And here's what we think, you know, estimated profit might be. How common is that? Are you like the only guy really doing that? Is that your sort of secret sauce or do you feel like other people are putting together similar packages? I, I, well, it's not a secret anymore. But, but I don't think anybody else is doing it. You know, again, I really pride myself in being detail oriented and creating really nice marketing pieces. Like that's my thing. Like I really want to have a nice brand. So if you go to my to my website, it's very clean. If you look at my Instagram profile, I try. It's getting better and better, right? It's not easy to like have a nice clean, bold and sophisticated look, but that's what that's what we're trying to build here. But I don't know anybody else that's that's doing that. There are a lot of agents that sell a lot of developments and they're and they're doing this, right? And the other way of getting these deals is by sending letters. So like I would drive around a whole area with my assistant and I will pick out tear down, tear down. We write the address we put on an Excel file and now we send handwritten envelopes and we send them a letter. I just close it. I'm actually under contract on the deal right now from a letter that I sent three months ago and they call me, hey, I got your letter. Do you still have that buyer? I'm like, yes, I do. I put the deal together and now we're under contract for another development deal, right? So not only doorknocking or cold calling these these tear down, but also sending letters works. I love that you're doing all of the things that you would assume a luxury agent probably doesn't have to do, right? Most luxury agents I know are not calling Fisbo's expires. They're not cold calling developers. They're not writing letters or maybe they are and maybe they're just not telling us on our show, but I appreciate that you weren't born into this luxury business. You really built it. You bootstrapped it and you saved up enough money so that you could explore that and I just go, those are the best stories I think. Let's talk about because again, so many of our agents are like, okay, I can start doing some of those things, but everybody wants to be a luxury agent. What's the major difference you've found because you do 20 plus million dollar properties as well? What's the major difference between working with a seller of a let's say a million dollar property or in LA, of course, you said everything's kind of at least in the area you service is kind of a million dollars even the smallest properties. What's the difference between working on the smallest property side to the ultra high net worth side? Are the needs and the goals basically the same or is it kind of a different world? I mean, I think at the core, it's the same thing. Somebody wants to find a home. In that respect, there's going to be an emotional attachment to selling real estate either in high end or in a lower price point. I think the only difference is that when you're selling real estate here, a lot of the times they have a business manager who can make things very difficult, a lawyer. By the way, are not emotionally involved in the property that a buyer or seller might be there emotionally involved in keeping their position, which their position is to very thoroughly review the financial component of this transaction, which I'm assuming is a big deal. So you not only have to win over the emotional side of the buyer or seller, but you also have to win over sort of the more empirical part, the objective part of dealing with now this team, which those are two very different masters to serve, I imagine. Yeah. And I think most of the people that I serve as here in LA, not everybody, but most of them are just sophisticated and they're educated and they're business owners. They're very smart people. Right? So they may know about the property more than you do. Like, if you're showing them property, they may have done all the research. So you have to be prepared a lot more than I was prepared when I was working in Rancho Cucamanga. I'm not saying you don't have to be prepared selling real estate in a smaller price point, but all I'm saying is that over here, I feel like you have to be more prepared because they are going to ask you tough questions and they're going to expect that you know that. They're going to expect that you know the market, that you know the players, that you know about the house, all that stuff. So I think that's the biggest difference. And then the other thing is when you're listing a property, I feel that you know I spend easily you know five to $6,000 per listing before it's even on the market. You know, I'm spending you know a grant, a two-grant on a photographer, same for a videographer, a floor plan. I do everything. Like we do Instagram ads, we do YouTube ads, we do Google ads for our listings. We want to be the best of the best, right? And that's how I, this is, this is my plan to get to the next level. Like I really want to start growing my business to the next level. I'm not there yet and I have a long way to go, but I know that if I keep doing this, I will get there because people are going to start noticing that I really take care of you. I'm going to look out for you and I'm going to get you top dollar or I will get you the best price if I'm revenue as the buyer's agent. Yeah, it's so funny to hear you, here's somebody say, I've sold 600 million in real estate. I'm not quite there yet. I'm just, but that's the motor that you have that keeps you going. 600 million is just where you're at today. It isn't necessarily where you want to be tomorrow, but it's so funny to hear that that really it seems like your entire career has been so much of put the blinders on, do the hard things that are maybe a little scary and uncomfortable, but are healthy and things that other agents aren't willing to do like door knocking. I mean, gosh, I would bet less than 1% of agents have ever door knocked or made a cold call quite honestly. I don't think people even do that as much anymore. And yet, here's somebody like you who still does it. And that is you would think a luxury agent wouldn't be going door to door. We sort of have our own misconceptions about what that even means, but it is one of those rare arts, this door knocking and letter writing that people really appreciate if done the right way. It's absolutely a lost art and has obviously been part of the secret, not secret, but part of the reason for your sense. And so let's talk about, I'm sure there's people that reach out to you that go, I want to break into the luxury market. What are your thoughts on that? I see I always think most agents shouldn't aspire to that unless they want to up their game. Like you were saying, now dealing with buyers and sellers who maybe are a bit more sophisticated, maybe are just more business focused. Like you said, a lot of business owners, a lot of people who have been successful in their careers and just have a level of sophistication that maybe people at lower price points, just don't have or aren't as interested in. And so you do have to appeal to that sort of those qualities of these more sophisticated buyers and sellers. What would your advice to be to somebody that says, I want to sell $20 million homes just like you? You know what, I think people glamorize because of what's on TV selling. Sure. And mind all listening. And I think it's just like so easy when you go into a luxury market, the competition is at a different level. This is why I have to up my game. Like the only reason why I'm doing this because when I lose a listing, I'm like, all right, why did I lose that listing? What can I do better? Now I'm adding another piece to my arsenal, little by little, right? So, you know, being part of the Tom Ferry organization, I see people in much smaller markets selling $500,000 houses that they're making 10 times more than me. You know, so I think for an agent, you got to think about, is it about the glamour of selling luxury real estate or is it about the money? Because you can make more money selling $500,000 houses with, you know, obviously more units than selling luxury property and selling just, you know, five or, you know, or 10 listings or sales per year. And not having to spend $5,000 plus per listing to market it. Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. So again, like if you're dream, like for me, my dream was never to sell luxury real estate. Like that, I never, you know, got into real estate to be in Beverly Hills. It just kind of fell into my lap, right? My mom kind of pushed me. My girlfriend was living here. I got the, you know, I got this isn't positioned with the with Chad, I held him in high land. So everything kind of, you know, kind of just, you know, like the road kind of led me there, right? But it wasn't like I was like, I want to sell, you know, $20,000 listings, you know, that now I do, right? But, but before that, you know, it wasn't really a big deal. For those ages that really, really want to get into luxury real estate because they love those kinds of houses. They want to work with those kinds of people. That's great. You should do it. I think joining a team is obviously, I think, you know, having a mentor or joining a team should be the first thing you do, 100%. You have to learn about how, you know, what it takes to, to, to be a player, learn the players, learn the area, learn the markets, who are the buyers, who are the sellers, right? And then after that, create a plan. You know, how am I going to get, you know, open houses is great way of finding buyers, right? You know, co-calling, door knocking, I mean, there's so many stories out there. Santiago, Arana, door knock Brentwood for years, he's killing it. You know, the guys on Melendar listing, you know, Parns, you know, the the Bonsi brothers, they also door knock and bell air. So there's so many stories of people that are not even from LA and they want to do luxury real estate, but they, but they grinded their way in. You know, you got to grind your way and it's super, super competitive. So if you got, if you got what it takes and you're in your competitive and you're willing to grind, then go ahead and do it. Why not? I mean, anybody can do it. I did it. And everybody, you know, a lot of other people did it too. Well, I think that's really such an inspiring message. If we sort of look back at your entire career, yes, there were opportunities that allowed you to get introduced to different types of audiences that you now work with, but nothing was handed to you at all. You made your own luck by doing the things that maybe other agents wouldn't be willing to do. Even from starting, you know, with sending out 10,000 emails to other agents. And by the way, not being a guy who's a self-promoter, right? That is something you would think maybe a self-promoter or a schmoozer would want to do because it's a good networking sort of exercise. You were just like, I need to find a mentor here. And so you earnestly send out all these messages. And then, you know, everything, you continue to do things like that throughout your entire career. Continue to do it today. It's not like, oh, now it's just, I just get calls all day from developers and from luxury, you know, buyers and sellers. You're still drumming up all this business on your own. And I think that's just a great, a great place to sort of wrap up for today because it is, it's like, it reminds me of that old, well, this ancient, I think it's a zen saying, I can't remember exactly where it comes from. So, I apologize if I'm getting this wrong, but the expression's a good one, which is before enlightenment, chop wood, carry water, after enlightenment, chop wood, carry water. It's like, you just got to keep keep doing that, you know, the hard things because that's what keeps everything going. It's not like, you don't feel like you've arrived, so to speak, because you're still doing the same exact things. And that's oddly, but also absolutely makes sense of why you're continuing to be successful. And who knows, maybe one day it'll all just come come into you without without that much effort, but it's working for you. And it's a great reminder of just practicing the fundamentals and consistently applying those. Just the same way we built our podcast here. It wasn't any one interview that got us, you know, yeah, it's just just consistency in talking to people like yourself. And what you shared was really super inspiring today. So I hope, I don't even hope, I know our audiences received a tremendous amount of benefit for any agents out there who might be might have clients that are moving to, you know, to the more exclusive areas of LA and the suburbs and are looking, you know, maybe they don't service that particular area. Maybe they're in a different state, but they have clients who maybe have second, third, fourth homes, and they maybe want to partner with a top agent like yourself. Or if there's, you know, anyone who is in the Beverly Hills and surrounding areas who's a buyer seller, investor developer or renter who wants to work with you directly, you know, what's the best way that one of our listeners could reach out to you? Call me, text me email me Instagram. I check all those things. So like myself on 310-387-1976. You know, call me, shoot me a text email Paul at PaulSalazarGroup.com. Instagram at PaulSalazarGroup. So it's very easy to get in touch with me. I've actually, you know, been, you know, I've had people reach out to me to ask for advice. I always, you know, give them a few minutes of my time to, because I listen, I respect that. You know, I was there at one point and I respect people that like go out there and reach out and like, you know, want to ask for advice. I've actually given, like, there's a kid in high school that sent me a long email saying he wants me to mentor him. I bought him to my open house. Now he helps me out with things. It's like it, when you put yourself out there, the world is going to give you gifts, you know, and I think a lot of people don't put themselves out there because it feels vulnerable. You got to get uncomfortable. You got to be durable. And the more vulnerable you get, the more uncomfortable you get, the more difficult things you do, the more you start to feel like empowered by yourself. Like, wow, I can do that. You know, I think that's probably my biggest tip for any listener here. Just start doing small things every single day that are that are difficult, you know, take a cold shower in the morning, waking up early, working out in the morning, making a, you know, one cold cold, door knocking one door, you know, going out and just meeting somebody, striking up a conversation. And you start to realize that, wow, why am I even worried about that? Why was I scared about that? You know, there's, we just have these, these fears because, you know, we've had this, it's a human condition, right? Sure. But once you get over this, then you start to get more empowered and you start to do more and more difficult things. Like, I still have a lot of things that I want to do that are, that are difficult, that I'm still, you know, getting too little by little. Cold showers is such a great example of a small thing that anybody can try. And it is shockingly difficult. It's more difficult than you think it's going to be thinking about it now. It's actually two times harder than what you're even thinking. And if you can, if you, I want everybody to try this tomorrow, and it's not because having a cold shower in and of itself is anything, it's the idea of it. And people say there's some health benefits, whatever that may or may not be. But what there definitely is a benefit is you, if you can make it 30 seconds, 60 seconds, and complete it, you will feel as much jubilation as if you just ran a marathon because it is that difficult. And that is an easy win. It's not an easy one. It's a very difficult win. If you can do that daily, I promise, just do it, try it once tomorrow, try to make it 10 seconds on ice cold, all the way to cold. It's tough. I did it for about a year. I need to get back into it. I did it many years ago, took me months to find the courage to do it. Months and months and months. And it sounds silly. I know I'm just talking about this one specific thing. But it's a something that you will, again, you will feel unbelievable as you walk out of that shower. You'll be like, I just did something crazy hard. And you're right. Then other things, which maybe aren't quite as difficult, don't seem as bad as they did before. So, oh my gosh, what a great thing. So do hard things, people that are healthy, do hard things that are healthy. And Paul, what a great, great place to wrap up. So everyone, go, please, Paul's a wonderful guy.
