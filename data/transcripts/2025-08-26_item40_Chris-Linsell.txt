[00:01:16] Today's episode is brought to you by corded.io. Are you looking for agents to join your brokerage
[00:01:23] or team? Now, as a real estate recruiter, I can tell you the answer is always yes. But most agents
[00:01:29] aren't looking to move right now. So how do you know who to contact? Well, what if I were to tell
[00:01:34] you there's a recruiting and retention tool powered by artificial intelligence that shows you
[00:01:38] exactly which agents in your local market are looking to leave their brokerage right now and
[00:01:44] which agents at your own firm are also looking to leave you? Now, I've been recruiting REALTORS for
[00:01:50] 15 years and I've hired over 2000 agents. I can tell you with no exaggeration, this is the tool
[00:01:56] I've been waiting for. Corded's AI looks for trends across dozens of variables for each agent in
[00:02:02] your market and shows you which agents they believe are likely to move. Not only does it do that,
[00:02:07] but corded's AI went and visited my recruiting website and read everything I offer. So now,
[00:02:13] when I'm recruiting, corded's AI tells me exactly what to say based on that agent's needs and what
[00:02:19] my brokerage can offer. It even writes emails for me. I've never seen anything like it and I use it
[00:02:25] every single day. Now, if you are looking to grow your brokerage, corded.io is the best tool out there.

[00:04:30] DJ, great to be here. Excited to chat. How are you? Before we jump in. I'm going to interrupt you.
[00:04:36] Before we jump in because I want to announce this before I forget, I wanted to hear about a project
[00:04:41] you are working on with luxury presence related to AI. Let's jump into it. Yeah. So luxury presence
[00:04:48] has been for a long time making a transition into making everything that we do, everything that we are
[00:05:03] based on the DNA of artificial intelligence. This is the next wave of technology,
[00:05:10] certainly in SaaS and in ProPtech and in the real estate industry at large. And even though real
[00:05:15] estate professionals are often, are often resistant to adopt brand new technologies, I can say with
[00:05:26] confidence that there is so much amazing opportunity in the residential real estate space powered by
[00:05:34] artificial intelligence. Luxury presence recently released our brand new product line, AI
[00:05:41] marketing specialists, these incredible, agentic AI assistants. Our whole idea here is that you
[00:05:48] can grow like a team without hiring a team with luxury presence as AI marketing specialists.
[00:05:54] This is an amazing service that we provide to all luxury presence clients. And as a part of this,
[00:06:00] my content team has been working hard and has recently released a amazing ebook that everyone
[00:06:07] should check out. It's called the AI discoverability playbook. It's all about how to make your brand,
[00:06:15] your content, and your work as a real estate professional visible online to large language models
[00:06:22] like chat GPT, Claude perplexity, Gemini, the list goes on and on. The reality is if you're not
[00:06:29] showing up in the search results or in the answers to questions being asked on LLM's like chat GPT,
[00:06:39] you're going to have a harder time finding your way into conversations with perspective buyers
[00:06:47] and sellers. And so in this ebook, which is incredibly comprehensive, it's like 8,000 words long,
[00:06:53] it goes super deep on all of the strategies that you need to find yourself as the answer to a
[00:07:02] question being asked on places like chat GPT. So available for free on our website. DJ will put
[00:07:10] the link in the show notes here. The AI discoverability playbook available at luxury presence. It's
[00:07:22] the best REALTOR in my market or who's the best real estate agent for condos in Bill and the blank.
[00:07:30] If you want to be the answer there, this is the guy that'll get you started.
[00:07:33] Yeah, and I will tell you I am in the process of looking to move myself and the first thing I did
[00:07:38] before going into my local MLS account, which I have access to, of course, and looking
[00:07:46] with their data, I wanted to chat GPT and I said, do you happen to know who are the top
[00:07:51] the top the agents who have the most market share in this particular neighborhood. And it gave me five
[00:07:57] answers. I don't know if those were the five correct answers, but I know it gave me five people
[00:08:02] that I wrote down. And then I would confirm that obviously with our MLS searches, but it was faster
[00:08:08] to do it with chat GPT. And so I did. And your clients are probably doing the same. I know that I
[00:08:15] want to be the I want to be in the results for when somebody types in, what's a good podcast to listen
[00:08:20] to do if I'm a real estate agent. I want that to show up and I've tested it. And we usually do
[00:08:25] show up, but not always. So I need to read this as well because I want to make sure this is almost
[00:08:30] like SEO search engine optimization for AI, which of course, I think is going to take over search.
[00:08:37] Certainly seems to be the trend. People are going to just be talking to their phones and asking
[00:08:41] a questions like we do now with chat GPT. And it's only going to be more and more that way. In fact,
[00:08:46] I've even noticed in Google now when we type a do a normal Google search, the first result, at
[00:08:51] least for me is a Gemini result, which is their AI. So that's if that's any indicator of where
[00:08:57] things are headed. You want to be in those those search results, which used to be we used to call
[00:09:01] those snippets. And that was a thing. And then that kind of went away. And now AI is here to tell us
[00:09:07] everything we want. And we need to be there. And so great. I love that you are writing about that
[00:09:13] because I haven't seen anybody write about it in this particular space. So thank you for that.
[00:09:17] We'll have a link to that in the show notes. Okay. Today, let's what is your unpopular real estate
[00:09:23] opinion for the day? Okay. I'm ready. Come at me now, everybody. Here's my unpopular opinion.
[00:09:31] I believe this is the best time in 10 years to be a buyer in the real estate market.
[00:09:38] Now even chat GPT will disagree with this because chat GPT I asked it this earlier today because
[00:09:46] we were talking about this particular topic. And I was actually asking it a week ago as well.
[00:09:51] And it said no, no, no, it is a seller's market. At least here in my local market in Chicago,
[00:09:57] of course, every market's unique. But tell us why you think it's actually a great time to buy.
[00:10:02] Well, okay. So first of all, I want to just point out that the answer that you got from
[00:10:09] Sam Altman over there at chat GPT isn't an invalid one, but it is one that uses what I believe
[00:10:19] to be the wrong factors for decision making, which by the way is one of the reasons why you want
[00:10:28] to keep working if you're a consumer with a licensed experienced expert real estate professional
[00:10:34] in your market. Because while the macro answers from places like chat GPT might make sense
[00:10:43] academically, theoretically, they don't always take into account the real market specific and even
[00:10:53] industry specific triggers that would say otherwise. So let me explain to you why I believe it's
[00:11:00] the best time in 10 years, 10 years to be a buyer. The high mortgage rates, which have been
[00:11:10] controversial, provocative, a thorn in the side to real estate professionals to buyers even to
[00:11:17] sellers and an absolute gift to anyone like me who makes content about real estate, the real estate
[00:11:26] industry who wants things to talk about. These high interest rates were a stumbling block, but they
[00:11:33] aren't anymore. In fact, I would venture to say that these mortgage rates are a feature now
[00:11:40] of the buyer's market, not a bug. The reason is these high mortgage rates have accidentally
[00:11:48] kicked off this cascade of market dynamics that have sneakily shifted us into this what I'm calling
[00:11:58] now a hidden buyer's market or a masked buyer's market. And there's stats to back this up. So
[00:12:09] longer on the market than they have for the last 10 years, the average days on market for the for
[00:12:16] homes in in July was 43 days. This is up almost 50% from just 18 months ago in July last year over 15
[00:12:26] percent of contracts in the residential real estate space were canceled canceled because of
[00:12:33] financing because of inspections because of appraisal. We all know why contracts don't make it through
[00:12:39] to closing, but 15 percent one it more than one in eight one in seven think about that of contracts
[00:12:48] are getting canceled list to sale ratios were historically in in the 2020s low in July. We for the
[00:12:59] first time in a long time had a negative list to sale ratio things were selling on average for less
[00:13:05] than that they were listed for in fact 20% of listings in the month of June had a price reduction
[00:13:13] 20% one in five. Okay now all of this to say let me summarize this with one big data point that
[00:13:22] is kind of hard to believe, but it's true June in 2025 just 40 days ago inventories and numbers are
[00:13:32] inventory year over year nationwide was up almost 29% I know I saw that too and I was I was surprised
[00:13:43] and I thought oh boy that is not the narrative that I have been hearing from agents of sort of
[00:13:49] in a granular way, but it is absolutely true listings or up and you can you can see how these
[00:13:56] mortgage rates have cascaded who have connected the dots and created some momentum that has
[00:14:04] summed itself into the stats that I just read out. Now of course this isn't the only factor we live
[00:14:10] in a multimodal multi-dimensional market where there's a lot of contributing factors, but these
[00:14:16] things are pushing hard on the direction that we're headed and it's important for us to call a
[00:14:24] spade a spade here. This has turned what feels like and according to chat GPT is on paper still a
[00:14:33] sellers market into a masked buyers market. It is actually the the table is set for the best
[00:14:41] opportunity to get the deal that you want in 2025 if you are a buyer, but it doesn't happen for
[00:14:49] everybody. There is a needle that needs to be threaded here, but more people can thread this needle
[00:14:55] than they think they can. Yeah so thinking about this from an agent's perspective so an agent says
[00:15:04] okay that sounds great yet and well here's one thing that is actually a positive that is real tangible
[00:15:13] that interest rates have dropped a bit. So we are at I think the lowest rate of 2025 for 30
[00:15:20] year fixed right now certainly for 15 year and the rates are pretty reasonable I think I think they're
[00:15:26] more digestible than they were and so I think buyers are it is easier to get them off the fence.
[00:15:36] I know here in my local market yes we have seen an increase in listings and we've seen an increase
[00:15:44] in days on market which is about the same as the national average it was 26 days a couple months ago
[00:15:51] and now it's in the 40s. So I'm curious actually let's talk about that real quick. Why do you think
[00:15:59] that homes are staying on the market longer? What do you think is going on there?
[00:16:03] Well I think there's a couple of there's a couple of factors here. The first thing is
[00:16:10] I think there is still a disconnect in the mines the collective minds of property sellers
[00:16:18] as to what the market conditions actually are. Most sellers are continually fed and I'm
[00:16:25] going to be honest with you I think real estate professionals sometimes negatively so add to this.
[00:16:31] Most sellers are continually fed this narrative that their property has never been worth more than
[00:16:37] it's worth right now you have historic equity here and there is still this incredible imbalance in
[00:16:45] the market so you should be listing your property to the moon in terms of your pricing strategy and
[00:16:50] that's just not the reality any longer. So the fact that the sellers have an unrealistic expectation
[00:16:58] relative to the current marketing current market strategy is going to buy default stretch out
[00:17:06] the days on market. The other thing that I think is really important to remember here is that if we
[00:17:12] have 30% more inventory than we did just a year ago there are well 30% more choices force buyers
[00:17:24] to consider. So let's just say for instance you've got a buyer out there who is who wants to spend
[00:17:31] a couple of weekends looking at property and so you are going to line up showings for them on this
[00:17:40] Saturday and on the following Saturday and let's say you would plan on lining up five showings on
[00:17:46] each of those days. Well now there's inventory to support instead of 10 total properties to look at
[00:17:56] 13 total properties to look at buyers have more choice and the choices that they are seeing are
[00:18:04] much more aligned to the average home price right now. We are seeing fewer and fewer of these ultra
[00:18:12] luxury and fewer and fewer of these ultra modest starter properties and much much more inventory at
[00:18:20] least locally in Michigan and in the Midwest areas where I follow very very closely the inventory is
[00:18:26] much more aligned with what I call civilian buyers rather than these aspirational buyers and so
[00:18:32] the typical home buyer just has a lot more choice which is going to drive them to spend more time
[00:18:38] making that choice. Yeah. Finally I want to say because smart buyers agents are recognizing that we
[00:18:48] are seeing a significant number of price reductions. I mean what did I what's the number over 20%
[00:18:55] of properties are experiencing a price reduction in the month of June. If you're a smart agent
[00:19:02] you are doing a CMA on any property that your buyers are considering and that CMA is likely coming up
[00:19:11] with a delta between where the property was priced and where you believe it should be valued
[00:19:17] which is going to stretch out the negotiation period increasing the days on market. It's also
[00:19:23] going to cause buyers to sit tight and say you know what I think I could probably even
[00:19:28] low ball this because they're going to reduce their price even further to get it in line with
[00:19:35] something reasonable. That is going to have disruptions in terms of the days on market as well.
[00:19:40] So there is a lot pointing to that but it's pretty clear there are a number of factors contributing
[00:19:46] here. Yeah you know I was thinking psychologically as an owner if because I get the
[00:19:52] zest of it for my particular property every month I get an automated email and I suspect a lot
[00:19:57] of people have that setup as well or some version of that where they're seeing what they think their
[00:20:02] value is based on another algorithm that is calculating it and when you see it hit a certain high
[00:20:09] water mark or if it just keeps increasing you don't I always take that as gospel in my mind. I'm
[00:20:18] like okay now my place is worth this number that is showing up in this email which I haven't verified.
[00:20:24] I just have seen it. I go oh it must be true. And yet when that number starts going down I'm
[00:20:32] less likely to trust that same exact data and that same number because it doesn't serve my goal of
[00:20:39] getting you know the highest possible price when I do eventually sell. So it's completely sort of
[00:20:46] fallacy in this it's not even logical for me to think this way but it's emotionally it makes a
[00:20:52] bit of sense I guess. So we want to see things increased in value. And so I'm wondering if there's
[00:20:57] a little bit of that going on where we maybe we got a CMA from our agent in the last year or so
[00:21:03] because we were telling every agent everyone who bought a home in the last five to seven years you
[00:21:09] need to tell them what their home is worth because there's more equity and you know this is just
[00:21:13] good news you they're happy. And so there's a lot of that going on and now maybe we're seeing a
[00:21:21] little bit of the the tide sort of go back receipt a little bit and maybe people are still stuck at
[00:21:27] that high watermark that they thought they were at they're emotionally attached to it. We know this
[00:21:32] happens with for sale by owners. The reason that FSBO leads exist is all based on
[00:21:38] emotional pricing. The reason why you can buy a list of these and actually convert a certain
[00:21:44] percentage of them as a real estate agent for people that are actively not wanting to work with
[00:21:47] an agent is because they're pricing their home too high. I mean it's it's just that simple. So I'm
[00:21:52] wondering if there's a bit of that going on where maybe a seller sees saw a number at one point
[00:21:59] and is attached to that number and is hopeful for that number and now we're seeing you know it's also
[00:22:04] the summer is coming to an end. We are you know we are getting toward the end of the the the busy
[00:22:10] season. So people are going back to school families are probably shoring up their searches for
[00:22:15] homes and less buyers are flooding the market and at the same time rates have come down a little
[00:22:20] bit. So there's an opportune time for some buyers to enter. So what would you do if you were an
[00:22:27] agent right now? How would you take advantage of this? Well I will say there is in my opinion there's
[00:22:33] no better time to develop an emerge in your market as the most accurate price in the entire
[00:22:43] uh county or the entire city. You want to be known as the person who can pinpoint the value of
[00:22:52] a property better than anyone else because that really is the goose that lays the golden eggs right
[00:22:59] now is your ability to effectively understand and communicate effectively to your clients how much
[00:23:07] a property is worth. So this should be priority number one for real estate professionals is
[00:23:14] figure out what it takes to increase the accuracy of your CMAs. Yeah. And I will go as far as
[00:23:23] saying that there are actually two approaches that you should use here. Three actually let's let's
[00:23:29] let's work these uh in order. The first is you and have to you just have to start using the tools
[00:23:36] that your disposal to look for trends and contributing factors to value that you weren't looking at
[00:23:43] 36 months ago. This means using excuse me using AI tools to examine market data for trends that you
[00:23:53] wouldn't be able to spot on your own or that your uh kind of basic out of the box CMA program provided
[00:24:00] by your uh by your brokerage isn't providing for you either. So what I'm talking about is like
[00:24:07] uploading your neighborhood or market data to an LLM like chat GPT asking for its help to analyze
[00:24:15] the trends that are contributing to the prices uh of the the sale prices of the properties uh in the
[00:24:22] area that you're focusing on and then comparing the results that you're getting um to your results to
[00:24:29] see if there are any uh unlocks that are happening as a result of that. So that's that's the first
[00:24:34] thing. We have these tools they're free to use um for the most part you can pay for the uh for the
[00:24:40] the premium versions of these uh chat tools like chat GPT or cloud but they have free versions that
[00:24:46] you can activate as well and get this work done. So that's the first thing you need to do is in
[00:24:50] sharp in your CMAs. The second thing you need to do is start talking about your CMAs um more
[00:24:56] strategically with your buyers and sellers. Here's the strategy that I use and and this is just
[00:25:03] it's so powerful it would be a waste for other folks not to use this. You have to stop giving your
[00:25:10] buyers or sellers one number and start giving them a range that and you call it your strategic range.
[00:25:17] So if you're selling your property you give them three numbers. Yeah. The the highest number is
[00:25:23] the conservative end. This is the number that you list at when you are comfortable being on the
[00:25:28] market for an extended period of time when you're comfortable having multiple showings when you're
[00:25:34] comfortable with uh with an extended negotiation period. This is the conservative number and who knows
[00:25:40] you might get it if you get just the right buyer at just the right time who wants it just in that
[00:25:45] moment but more than likely you're in for a little bit of a fight. The middle number is your
[00:25:50] neutral number. This is the where you feel you are closest to market value uh and where you're likely
[00:25:56] to get an offer at 100% of the price of the asking price and then you have the aggressive model that
[00:26:02] is optimized for speed. You want to uh induce a lot of market activity happening very quickly. It's
[00:26:09] certainly uh priced uh a little bit below what that neutral number is because you're optimizing for
[00:26:17] speed in the hopes that it induces a competitive bid scenario and uh booy's that price back up.
[00:26:25] You have to stop thinking about value as a single number and more as a strategic range.
[00:26:31] And what that does for you is it opens up the range that you can be considered accurate and it
[00:26:38] positions you as the uh real estate professional who is the go to the goat in your market for uh
[00:26:48] accurately pricing property. So those are the first two. Start utilizing the tools that you
[00:26:54] have at your disposal to unlock hidden trends and make your pricing more accurate. Number two
[00:27:00] start talking about your CMAs as a strategic range instead of a single number. You can
[00:27:07] miss a thousand different ways if you're doing a single number. You get a ton of room to be accurate
[00:27:14] when you're providing a strategic range and then the third the third tool and frankly this is the
[00:27:21] hardest one to pull off but you need to get better at telling the story of the value of the property
[00:27:29] and if you're listing the property for sale it means your marketing has to do a better job of
[00:27:35] demonstrating that value and if you are representing the buyer in a property or in the pursuit
[00:27:43] of a property for sale you need to do a better job of telling the story of why the market
[00:27:50] is represented your proper your price your proposed price better. This has become a market of uh
[00:27:58] where real estate professionals as marketers have to be storytellers maybe in a way that they
[00:28:04] haven't necessarily uh in the last in the previous 10 years of this business. You this is of an
[00:28:12] opportunity to demonstrate your value as a professional and right now that the the ability to
[00:28:19] effectively tell your story means a lot and especially when we have this masked buyers market where
[00:28:27] there aren't guarantees by any means and when we're seeing it like days on market are up 50%
[00:28:33] from where they were a year ago you know we have price reductions on a fifth of the properties
[00:28:38] that are hitting. This is about storytelling right now so if you are doing these three things
[00:28:44] using the advanced tools implementing a strategic range and focusing on your storytelling
[00:28:51] this will become a place where you are gaining business not a threat for losing business.
[00:28:59] I think this storytelling is such a great advice and it applies as you said both to the list agent
[00:29:05] and the technically the sell agent or representing the buyer because if we think about well how do
[00:29:12] you do that on the buy side and we're not necessarily talking about writing the love letter right so
[00:29:17] there's there's there's some problematic practices with doing things like that and you can check
[00:29:23] with your local you know your state rules for if that's allowed in some states allow it in others
[00:29:29] don't. What we're talking about I think is showing up for your buyer and representing your buyers
[00:29:37] motivation and urgency and how excited you are as the representing the buyer is the agent to the
[00:29:45] list agent. I actually made a video about this earlier this week which is on our YouTube channel and
[00:29:52] I think everywhere I just made a 10 minute video where I said here's what top 1% agents are telling
[00:29:56] me they're doing right now to get their offers noticed and accepted even when not highest and best
[00:30:03] and it comes down to a lot of effort it is really kind of similar to what you were saying with
[00:30:09] storytelling it is about telling that list agent my client wants this property they need this property
[00:30:14] they're willing to do x, y and z to get it and then staying on top of that list agent making sure
[00:30:20] that they are following up over and over and over again to try to get that deal closed and it
[00:30:25] it works and what's interesting is talking to top agents on the list side is they are always
[00:30:32] impressed rarely annoyed by aggressive or at least persistent buy side agents so agents that are
[00:30:41] professional that have good lenders that send things like the offer letter along with a summary
[00:30:52] sending the stuff from the mortgage showing proof of funds even showing things like that attaching
[00:30:59] it to the offer letter and saying we're with and then having the loan officer call the cellar's
[00:31:06] and saying hey we can get this thing to close real fast like this person's ready to go and putting
[00:31:13] all of those arrows in their quiver taking them out and firing them and saying no no we're the
[00:31:19] team you want to close with because we can get this done is I think part of the storytelling
[00:31:24] process. Totally well and if you consider remember like that 15% of contracts were cancelled in
[00:31:33] July 2025 this is a legitimate concern for buyers or for sellers right now is whether or not a contract
[00:31:40] will actually be seen through to the closing table. It's interesting I would say that right now we
[00:31:47] are we are in a period of time where it is now maybe not necessarily happily welcome from the
[00:31:59] listing agent but it isn't unacceptable any longer to submit your CMA along with your offer to be
[00:32:08] like hey listen I know I know we're coming in 50 grand below where you have this listed but listen
[00:32:15] here are the comps that I'm looking at here's the here's the process that we use to come to this
[00:32:20] number we feel like this is a fair representation of value in the market we can also offer you like you
[00:32:28] said these levels of assurance that this is a good contract that's going to make it to the closing
[00:32:34] table like this was not this was unheard of in 2021 when people were making you know properties
[00:32:46] were getting 15 offers without a single showing yeah you know there was you would be laughed out of
[00:32:52] the digital room if you submitted an offer below ask with your CMA attached to it you know
[00:33:01] listing agents would just be like okay we appreciate this we have 10 other offers all over
[00:33:07] ask with zero inspections and five of them are cash so you're welcome to submit I'm happy to
[00:33:14] fulfill my duties to show my client but there's not a snowball chance in hell that this is going
[00:33:20] to get accepted because why would somebody accept this those days are gone friends and you know
[00:33:26] it's kind of wild to think this but here's just a little reminder we are almost at the inventories
[00:33:36] of pre-COVID real estate right now like this is
[00:33:42] that we are in there is a market snapshot right now that if you took the dates off of it
[00:33:51] could be confused with pre-COVID real estate some dimensions of it not all dimensions and in fact
[00:33:58] there are a couple of dimensions that are changing that are kind of accentuating this masked
[00:34:06] buyer market phenomenon one of them are the incentives that we're seeing being tacked onto
[00:34:13] listings um I'd love to chat a little bit about this are you familiar with with the kind of the
[00:34:19] incentive phenomenon that is starting to emerge especially in the new build space no so new
[00:34:26] construction um they're starting to get a trend where new construction homes are being offered
[00:34:33] with incentives things that don't really feel incentive incentive um you know kind of at first but
[00:34:40] the more you dig into them you realize what's actually going on here things like um an offer to
[00:34:47] buy down points on your mortgage things like an offer to upgrade appliances things like an offer
[00:34:58] to allow a certain level of customization on new builds that wasn't a part of the original package
[00:35:07] and though these sorts of incentives have existed forever they have started to become a little
[00:35:13] bit more aggressive and we're starting to see them putting pressure on the existing home stock
[00:35:18] market such that the incentives that you're getting from um new build construction are making their way
[00:35:26] into um listing uh existing stock and the place where we see this the most is frankly a direct
[00:35:35] downstream uh result of the uh of the the the NAR lawsuits the commission lawsuits where we are
[00:35:44] seeing more and more officially the offer of buyer's agent compensation as a part of the
[00:35:51] the uh the the listing of the property for sale that you with with your list price you get
[00:35:59] compensation of your buyer's agent which you know we all know this was the big debate for a long time
[00:36:05] um so we're starting to see these these sorts of incentives and and i tell you what if the
[00:36:13] incentive of like purchasing down mortgage points as a part of the uh of the package starts to become
[00:36:22] the norm in in terms of sellers offering this to buyers i mean i think then we take the mask off
[00:36:29] like this isn't just this isn't a masked buyer's market anymore even if the numbers are saying
[00:36:33] otherwise this is a buyer's market if if if sellers are incentivizing their buyers that much to
[00:36:41] get in the ring yeah that the buy down ideas is an interesting one and i almost wonder if individual
[00:36:48] home sellers who are not developers could creatively if their property isn't getting the attention
[00:36:56] it deserves for the price they want they could throw that into the mix and really spice spice up
[00:37:02] the game a little bit uh that would be a very interesting thing for you know a non-developer
[00:37:08] primary resident owner uh to to consider doing i also think too is this a great time to sell by
[00:37:15] meaning owning a home wanting to make that move in the next 12 to 24 months maybe thinking well
[00:37:23] if i wait for rates to come down further maybe that would spike a more buyers hitting the market
[00:37:29] certainly more properties would hit the market but prices will certainly go up
[00:37:34] maybe it does make sense because my property likely has appreciated at least over the last five to
[00:37:41] seven years maybe it makes sense that yet maybe it's not at its high water mark uh that it was
[00:37:46] you know three four months ago but perhaps it's a great time when less buyers are here i still
[00:37:54] sell it at a premium i have a bit more inventory to choose from when i go to buy maybe i maybe
[00:38:00] i start buying before i even consider selling and knowing that you know if i price correctly and i
[00:38:06] don't and and i don't shoot for you know a uh trying to sell over my list price which we know is
[00:38:16] is not as effective right now so maybe we have a more sort of dialed in pricing strategy
[00:38:22] for my existing property and i realize okay i do i look at the data and say if i have this price
[00:38:29] correctly how quickly do homes go under contract in my area which jensh ebt if not that
[00:38:36] can should be able to tell you if not export data from your your MLS and it can do that or your
[00:38:41] MLS probably can do that as well um but knowing that number is really important because then you can
[00:38:47] bring that to your home owner and say look i know right now you might be thinking there's not much
[00:38:53] inventory let's actually show you the inventory in the next area of the town you live in that you
[00:38:58] want to move to or the next neighborhood or next suburb or here's the next move you're looking to
[00:39:03] make there's stuff out there right now here's what it's priced at here's how quickly we could probably
[00:39:08] get yours under contract once you find a property and maybe we can make this happen um a little bit
[00:39:14] more so again whether or not they do it is is up to them what i think is is this valuable to people
[00:39:22] is this a value to demonstrate why you're still relevant why you're still needed as an agent and i
[00:39:30] think it is i think this is whether or not somebody takes action as a home current home owner is just
[00:39:37] wow my agent came to me with kind of an interesting idea and i hadn't thought of that because of
[00:39:42] course they haven't thought about it maybe they're looking at inventory right now maybe they're
[00:39:47] looking at what their homes worth but they aren't necessarily looking about historically where does
[00:39:51] where do things sit in relation to you know the current trends and i think that's as you were saying
[00:39:57] what is the value of the agent that can still be can still supersede what they can type into a chat
[00:40:04] prompt this is about experience this is about knowing the best lenders to work with this is about
[00:40:09] having your strategy of here's how i'm going to work to get you the buy side first and here's how
[00:40:16] i'm going to be super aggressive to help make that happen and then here's how we're going to be
[00:40:21] super aggressive to get the home sold at the same time and i i think this is just a fun conversation
[00:40:28] to have regardless of the outcome to the actual current homeowner for their first time home buyers
[00:40:34] i think this is an easy win you know what we're talking about is an easy conversation i think this
[00:40:39] is actually a great conversation for home current homeowners who are talking about making a switch
[00:40:43] yeah yeah yeah i mean at the end of the day uh you're you're you're 100% right that there is
[00:40:52] massive opportunity um on a case by case strategic basis but this is one of those
[00:41:01] perfect illustrations of why we are not at a place where we can trust uh something like a chat
[00:41:11] GPT to give us the level of personalized uh advice um and assistance that we need when making
[00:41:19] this sort of you know the uh a decision with this amount of gravity to it because ultimately the
[00:41:26] the the true um in my opinion the true value of working with a real estate professional is their
[00:41:35] specific market experience and insight relative to my specific needs i mean i i i am thrilled
[00:41:44] to get a chance to work with an agent who's the number one condo agent in all of Chicago but if
[00:41:49] that person can't apply their um expertise to my specific set of needs then that accolade means
[00:41:58] nothing to me and so to that end the real you know gold opportunity here is to uh be able to
[00:42:10] take that expertise and experience and that reputation that you've developed in your market um to be
[00:42:18] able to interpret the the kind of the smoke signals that are uh this this current market that we find
[00:42:26] ourselves in and understand how those signals become advantages or disadvantages for your specific
[00:42:33] client because if you can go to your client or to your prospect if you've got somebody who's on
[00:42:39] the fence about whether or not they're going to buy or sell you come to them and say listen you know
[00:42:44] this is this is what i'm reading in our market as to what's going on here's how it applies
[00:42:50] directly to your decision i mean this is kind of a no-brainer for me like if somebody comes to me and says
[00:42:55] like this is the best time this is the best chance that you're going to have in the last 10 years
[00:43:00] right now is the best chance that you have to get the deal that you want on the house of your dreams
[00:43:05] that will set you up for the life that's going to you know creating the life that you want of course
[00:43:11] i'm going to sit up and listen to that but if you don't position yourself as somebody who has
[00:43:18] one handle on exactly what's happening to who has the courage to be able to say look i know
[00:43:25] you know CNBC and chat GPT are going to tell you this is a sellers market but this is actually a
[00:43:30] masked buyer's market and here's why and three i know that these are your goals these are the things
[00:43:37] that are important to you here's how those goals get met in this current market somebody comes
[00:43:43] to me with that i mean i am more than intrigued i'm ready to start looking because that person is
[00:43:50] doing exactly what i need them to do for me yeah i bought a car a year and a half ago and i bought
[00:43:56] a brand new car and i bought it in my companies my company bought it and so it was at a
[00:44:03] even though i i have my credit is great i still it was at a time when interest rates were higher
[00:44:09] and so as a result i have this high interest rate on this brand or year and a half old car
[00:44:15] and i love my car and my intention was to drive it for the next 10 years or more and drive it
[00:44:22] until you know i've gotten my value out of it i have no intention of trading it in or
[00:44:27] you know making any sort of switch however i rates have come down recently and i in the process
[00:44:33] said oh maybe i can refinance it well turns out it's a little bit more challenging to do that in the
[00:44:37] when it's in a company's name as opposed to an individual so i'm sort of in this position where
[00:44:42] i reached out to a few different lenders and said hey can we refinance they're like oh it's a
[00:44:47] little tricky and so it's kind of at a roadblock so it's like okay this is just where i'm at now
[00:44:53] if the person who's told me the car who knows this is my situation knows all of this information
[00:44:59] if came to me and said i have i have an i have an solution for you and maybe it's not even an
[00:45:05] ideal solution but maybe it's hey i can get you a brand new car a year and a half later and you're
[00:45:12] it's only going to cost you x amount and we're going to get rid of the old one and it's still worth
[00:45:16] x you know i don't i don't even care if i do it or not i would be so impressed that somebody came
[00:45:23] to me with some idea that was in my interest or possibly in my interest that i would be like oh
[00:45:29] i'm never going to another car dealer because this person's thinking about me so and again
[00:45:34] maybe it's a pipe dream i don't think and this is throwing no shade at my person who sold me my
[00:45:38] car they're wonderful but these are the kind of things that separate good agents from great
[00:45:43] agents and if you are just saying hey i've got i've got this thought and maybe it doesn't apply to
[00:45:48] you but i'd like you to just at least consider it or at least hear what's going on at the very
[00:45:54] least they're like wow my agent really is on top of things so again whether this results in activity
[00:46:02] for your clients they're going to be impressed with your activity and probably share that information
[00:46:07] with other friends and family whose agents are probably thinking you know oh they just bought a
[00:46:13] home two years ago or three years ago why would they you know why would they consider moving and
[00:46:19] of course we know that follow up is the fortunes in the follow up so we want to stay in touch and
[00:46:23] we always want to know what our clients are doing but we know that that's you know if we're not
[00:46:30] providing this information people are going to seek it out on their own and they're going to get
[00:46:36] some good some bad because they're going to look it up on either chat gbt or online and they don't
[00:46:41] have the professional unless they call you which great if you're that agent that they call
[00:46:47] but you need to make those proactive calls for so Chris this is a great great episode to talk about
[00:46:53] why it possibly is a good time to consider purchasing and sort of how to position that so i
[00:47:01] i think it's a great place to wrap up this is definitely an unpopular real estate opinion however
[00:47:06] backed up with some really good solid logic so thank you on behalf of the audience for coming
[00:47:13] really with a with a with a with a with a banger this this month this was a good one and we appreciate
[00:47:19] Chris every month for his opinions and even though they are unpopular they are often accurate so
[00:47:26] i want everybody to follow Chris you can find him on LinkedIn you can find him on Instagram you can

[00:47:46] speaking at those uh those endeavors as well and also consider having him speak at some of your own
[00:47:54] you know conferences so definitely on behalf of the audience thanks Chris on behalf of Chris myself

Now, as a real estate recruiter, I can tell you the answer is always yes. But most agents aren't looking to move right now. So how do you know who to contact? Well, what if I were to tell you there's a recruiting and retention tool powered by artificial intelligence that shows you exactly which agents in your local market are looking to leave their brokerage right now and which agents at your own firm are also looking to leave you? Now, I've been recruiting REALTORS for 15 years and I've hired over 2000 agents. I can tell you with no exaggeration, this is the tool I've been waiting for. Corded's AI looks for trends across dozens of variables for each agent in your market and shows you which agents they believe are likely to move. Not only does it do that, but corded's AI went and visited my recruiting website and read everything I offer. So now, when I'm recruiting, corded's AI tells me exactly what to say based on that agent's needs and what my brokerage can offer. It even writes emails for me. I've never seen anything like it and I use it every single day. Now, if you are looking to grow your brokerage, corded.io is the best tool out there. Visit corded.io to schedule a demo again.

How are you? Before we jump in. I'm going to interrupt you. Before we jump in because I want to announce this before I forget, I wanted to hear about a project you are working on with luxury presence related to AI. Let's jump into it. Yeah. So luxury presence has been for a long time making a transition into making everything that we do, everything that we are based on the DNA of artificial intelligence. This is the next wave of technology, certainly in SaaS and in ProPtech and in the real estate industry at large. And even though real estate professionals are often, are often resistant to adopt brand new technologies, I can say with confidence that there is so much amazing opportunity in the residential real estate space powered by artificial intelligence. Luxury presence recently released our brand new product line, AI marketing specialists, these incredible, agentic AI assistants. Our whole idea here is that you can grow like a team without hiring a team with luxury presence as AI marketing specialists. This is an amazing service that we provide to all luxury presence clients. And as a part of this, my content team has been working hard and has recently released a amazing ebook that everyone should check out. It's called the AI discoverability playbook. It's all about how to make your brand, your content, and your work as a real estate professional visible online to large language models like chat GPT, Claude perplexity, Gemini, the list goes on and on. The reality is if you're not showing up in the search results or in the answers to questions being asked on LLM's like chat GPT, you're going to have a harder time finding your way into conversations with perspective buyers and sellers. And so in this ebook, which is incredibly comprehensive, it's like 8,000 words long, it goes super deep on all of the strategies that you need to find yourself as the answer to a question being asked on places like chat GPT. So available for free on our website. DJ will put the link in the show notes here. The AI discoverability playbook available at luxury presence. It's the best REALTOR in my market or who's the best real estate agent for condos in Bill and the blank. If you want to be the answer there, this is the guy that'll get you started. Yeah, and I will tell you I am in the process of looking to move myself and the first thing I did before going into my local MLS account, which I have access to, of course, and looking with their data, I wanted to chat GPT and I said, do you happen to know who are the top the top the agents who have the most market share in this particular neighborhood. And it gave me five answers. I don't know if those were the five correct answers, but I know it gave me five people that I wrote down. And then I would confirm that obviously with our MLS searches, but it was faster to do it with chat GPT. And so I did. And your clients are probably doing the same. I know that I want to be the I want to be in the results for when somebody types in, what's a good podcast to listen to do if I'm a real estate agent. I want that to show up and I've tested it. And we usually do show up, but not always. So I need to read this as well because I want to make sure this is almost like SEO search engine optimization for AI, which of course, I think is going to take over search. Certainly seems to be the trend. People are going to just be talking to their phones and asking a questions like we do now with chat GPT. And it's only going to be more and more that way. In fact, I've even noticed in Google now when we type a do a normal Google search, the first result, at least for me is a Gemini result, which is their AI. So that's if that's any indicator of where things are headed. You want to be in those those search results, which used to be we used to call those snippets. And that was a thing. And then that kind of went away. And now AI is here to tell us everything we want. And we need to be there. And so great. I love that you are writing about that because I haven't seen anybody write about it in this particular space. So thank you for that. We'll have a link to that in the show notes. Okay. Today, let's what is your unpopular real estate opinion for the day? Okay. I'm ready. Come at me now, everybody. Here's my unpopular opinion. I believe this is the best time in 10 years to be a buyer in the real estate market. Now even chat GPT will disagree with this because chat GPT I asked it this earlier today because we were talking about this particular topic. And I was actually asking it a week ago as well. And it said no, no, no, it is a seller's market. At least here in my local market in Chicago, of course, every market's unique. But tell us why you think it's actually a great time to buy. Well, okay. So first of all, I want to just point out that the answer that you got from Sam Altman over there at chat GPT isn't an invalid one, but it is one that uses what I believe to be the wrong factors for decision making, which by the way is one of the reasons why you want to keep working if you're a consumer with a licensed experienced expert real estate professional in your market. Because while the macro answers from places like chat GPT might make sense academically, theoretically, they don't always take into account the real market specific and even industry specific triggers that would say otherwise. So let me explain to you why I believe it's the best time in 10 years, 10 years to be a buyer. The high mortgage rates, which have been controversial, provocative, a thorn in the side to real estate professionals to buyers even to sellers and an absolute gift to anyone like me who makes content about real estate, the real estate industry who wants things to talk about. These high interest rates were a stumbling block, but they aren't anymore. In fact, I would venture to say that these mortgage rates are a feature now of the buyer's market, not a bug. The reason is these high mortgage rates have accidentally kicked off this cascade of market dynamics that have sneakily shifted us into this what I'm calling now a hidden buyer's market or a masked buyer's market. And there's stats to back this up. So longer on the market than they have for the last 10 years, the average days on market for the for homes in in July was 43 days. This is up almost 50% from just 18 months ago in July last year over 15 percent of contracts in the residential real estate space were canceled canceled because of financing because of inspections because of appraisal. We all know why contracts don't make it through to closing, but 15 percent one it more than one in eight one in seven think about that of contracts are getting canceled list to sale ratios were historically in in the 2020s low in July. We for the first time in a long time had a negative list to sale ratio things were selling on average for less than that they were listed for in fact 20% of listings in the month of June had a price reduction 20% one in five. Okay now all of this to say let me summarize this with one big data point that is kind of hard to believe, but it's true June in 2025 just 40 days ago inventories and numbers are inventory year over year nationwide was up almost 29% I know I saw that too and I was I was surprised and I thought oh boy that is not the narrative that I have been hearing from agents of sort of in a granular way, but it is absolutely true listings or up and you can you can see how these mortgage rates have cascaded who have connected the dots and created some momentum that has summed itself into the stats that I just read out. Now of course this isn't the only factor we live in a multimodal multi-dimensional market where there's a lot of contributing factors, but these things are pushing hard on the direction that we're headed and it's important for us to call a spade a spade here. This has turned what feels like and according to chat GPT is on paper still a sellers market into a masked buyers market. It is actually the the table is set for the best opportunity to get the deal that you want in 2025 if you are a buyer, but it doesn't happen for everybody. There is a needle that needs to be threaded here, but more people can thread this needle than they think they can. Yeah so thinking about this from an agent's perspective so an agent says okay that sounds great yet and well here's one thing that is actually a positive that is real tangible that interest rates have dropped a bit. So we are at I think the lowest rate of 2025 for 30 year fixed right now certainly for 15 year and the rates are pretty reasonable I think I think they're more digestible than they were and so I think buyers are it is easier to get them off the fence. I know here in my local market yes we have seen an increase in listings and we've seen an increase in days on market which is about the same as the national average it was 26 days a couple months ago and now it's in the 40s. So I'm curious actually let's talk about that real quick. Why do you think that homes are staying on the market longer? What do you think is going on there? Well I think there's a couple of there's a couple of factors here. The first thing is I think there is still a disconnect in the mines the collective minds of property sellers as to what the market conditions actually are. Most sellers are continually fed and I'm going to be honest with you I think real estate professionals sometimes negatively so add to this. Most sellers are continually fed this narrative that their property has never been worth more than it's worth right now you have historic equity here and there is still this incredible imbalance in the market so you should be listing your property to the moon in terms of your pricing strategy and that's just not the reality any longer. So the fact that the sellers have an unrealistic expectation relative to the current marketing current market strategy is going to buy default stretch out the days on market. The other thing that I think is really important to remember here is that if we have 30% more inventory than we did just a year ago there are well 30% more choices force buyers to consider. So let's just say for instance you've got a buyer out there who is who wants to spend a couple of weekends looking at property and so you are going to line up showings for them on this Saturday and on the following Saturday and let's say you would plan on lining up five showings on each of those days. Well now there's inventory to support instead of 10 total properties to look at 13 total properties to look at buyers have more choice and the choices that they are seeing are much more aligned to the average home price right now. We are seeing fewer and fewer of these ultra luxury and fewer and fewer of these ultra modest starter properties and much much more inventory at least locally in Michigan and in the Midwest areas where I follow very very closely the inventory is much more aligned with what I call civilian buyers rather than these aspirational buyers and so the typical home buyer just has a lot more choice which is going to drive them to spend more time making that choice. Yeah. Finally I want to say because smart buyers agents are recognizing that we are seeing a significant number of price reductions. I mean what did I what's the number over 20% of properties are experiencing a price reduction in the month of June. If you're a smart agent you are doing a CMA on any property that your buyers are considering and that CMA is likely coming up with a delta between where the property was priced and where you believe it should be valued which is going to stretch out the negotiation period increasing the days on market. It's also going to cause buyers to sit tight and say you know what I think I could probably even low ball this because they're going to reduce their price even further to get it in line with something reasonable. That is going to have disruptions in terms of the days on market as well. So there is a lot pointing to that but it's pretty clear there are a number of factors contributing here. Yeah you know I was thinking psychologically as an owner if because I get the zest of it for my particular property every month I get an automated email and I suspect a lot of people have that setup as well or some version of that where they're seeing what they think their value is based on another algorithm that is calculating it and when you see it hit a certain high water mark or if it just keeps increasing you don't I always take that as gospel in my mind. I'm like okay now my place is worth this number that is showing up in this email which I haven't verified. I just have seen it. I go oh it must be true. And yet when that number starts going down I'm less likely to trust that same exact data and that same number because it doesn't serve my goal of getting you know the highest possible price when I do eventually sell. So it's completely sort of fallacy in this it's not even logical for me to think this way but it's emotionally it makes a bit of sense I guess. So we want to see things increased in value. And so I'm wondering if there's a little bit of that going on where we maybe we got a CMA from our agent in the last year or so because we were telling every agent everyone who bought a home in the last five to seven years you need to tell them what their home is worth because there's more equity and you know this is just good news you they're happy. And so there's a lot of that going on and now maybe we're seeing a little bit of the the tide sort of go back receipt a little bit and maybe people are still stuck at that high watermark that they thought they were at they're emotionally attached to it. We know this happens with for sale by owners. The reason that FSBO leads exist is all based on emotional pricing. The reason why you can buy a list of these and actually convert a certain percentage of them as a real estate agent for people that are actively not wanting to work with an agent is because they're pricing their home too high. I mean it's it's just that simple. So I'm wondering if there's a bit of that going on where maybe a seller sees saw a number at one point and is attached to that number and is hopeful for that number and now we're seeing you know it's also the summer is coming to an end. We are you know we are getting toward the end of the the the busy season. So people are going back to school families are probably shoring up their searches for homes and less buyers are flooding the market and at the same time rates have come down a little bit. So there's an opportune time for some buyers to enter. So what would you do if you were an agent right now? How would you take advantage of this? Well I will say there is in my opinion there's no better time to develop an emerge in your market as the most accurate price in the entire uh county or the entire city. You want to be known as the person who can pinpoint the value of a property better than anyone else because that really is the goose that lays the golden eggs right now is your ability to effectively understand and communicate effectively to your clients how much a property is worth. So this should be priority number one for real estate professionals is figure out what it takes to increase the accuracy of your CMAs. Yeah. And I will go as far as saying that there are actually two approaches that you should use here. Three actually let's let's let's work these uh in order. The first is you and have to you just have to start using the tools that your disposal to look for trends and contributing factors to value that you weren't looking at 36 months ago. This means using excuse me using AI tools to examine market data for trends that you wouldn't be able to spot on your own or that your uh kind of basic out of the box CMA program provided by your uh by your brokerage isn't providing for you either. So what I'm talking about is like uploading your neighborhood or market data to an LLM like chat GPT asking for its help to analyze the trends that are contributing to the prices uh of the the sale prices of the properties uh in the area that you're focusing on and then comparing the results that you're getting um to your results to see if there are any uh unlocks that are happening as a result of that. So that's that's the first thing. We have these tools they're free to use um for the most part you can pay for the uh for the the premium versions of these uh chat tools like chat GPT or cloud but they have free versions that you can activate as well and get this work done. So that's the first thing you need to do is in sharp in your CMAs. The second thing you need to do is start talking about your CMAs um more strategically with your buyers and sellers. Here's the strategy that I use and and this is just it's so powerful it would be a waste for other folks not to use this. You have to stop giving your buyers or sellers one number and start giving them a range that and you call it your strategic range. So if you're selling your property you give them three numbers. Yeah. The the highest number is the conservative end. This is the number that you list at when you are comfortable being on the market for an extended period of time when you're comfortable having multiple showings when you're comfortable with uh with an extended negotiation period. This is the conservative number and who knows you might get it if you get just the right buyer at just the right time who wants it just in that moment but more than likely you're in for a little bit of a fight. The middle number is your neutral number. This is the where you feel you are closest to market value uh and where you're likely to get an offer at 100% of the price of the asking price and then you have the aggressive model that is optimized for speed. You want to uh induce a lot of market activity happening very quickly. It's certainly uh priced uh a little bit below what that neutral number is because you're optimizing for speed in the hopes that it induces a competitive bid scenario and uh booy's that price back up. You have to stop thinking about value as a single number and more as a strategic range. And what that does for you is it opens up the range that you can be considered accurate and it positions you as the uh real estate professional who is the go to the goat in your market for uh accurately pricing property. So those are the first two. Start utilizing the tools that you have at your disposal to unlock hidden trends and make your pricing more accurate. Number two start talking about your CMAs as a strategic range instead of a single number. You can miss a thousand different ways if you're doing a single number. You get a ton of room to be accurate when you're providing a strategic range and then the third the third tool and frankly this is the hardest one to pull off but you need to get better at telling the story of the value of the property and if you're listing the property for sale it means your marketing has to do a better job of demonstrating that value and if you are representing the buyer in a property or in the pursuit of a property for sale you need to do a better job of telling the story of why the market is represented your proper your price your proposed price better. This has become a market of uh where real estate professionals as marketers have to be storytellers maybe in a way that they haven't necessarily uh in the last in the previous 10 years of this business. You this is of an opportunity to demonstrate your value as a professional and right now that the the ability to effectively tell your story means a lot and especially when we have this masked buyers market where there aren't guarantees by any means and when we're seeing it like days on market are up 50% from where they were a year ago you know we have price reductions on a fifth of the properties that are hitting. This is about storytelling right now so if you are doing these three things using the advanced tools implementing a strategic range and focusing on your storytelling this will become a place where you are gaining business not a threat for losing business. I think this storytelling is such a great advice and it applies as you said both to the list agent and the technically the sell agent or representing the buyer because if we think about well how do you do that on the buy side and we're not necessarily talking about writing the love letter right so there's there's there's some problematic practices with doing things like that and you can check with your local you know your state rules for if that's allowed in some states allow it in others don't. What we're talking about I think is showing up for your buyer and representing your buyers motivation and urgency and how excited you are as the representing the buyer is the agent to the list agent. I actually made a video about this earlier this week which is on our YouTube channel and I think everywhere I just made a 10 minute video where I said here's what top 1% agents are telling me they're doing right now to get their offers noticed and accepted even when not highest and best and it comes down to a lot of effort it is really kind of similar to what you were saying with storytelling it is about telling that list agent my client wants this property they need this property they're willing to do x, y and z to get it and then staying on top of that list agent making sure that they are following up over and over and over again to try to get that deal closed and it it works and what's interesting is talking to top agents on the list side is they are always impressed rarely annoyed by aggressive or at least persistent buy side agents so agents that are professional that have good lenders that send things like the offer letter along with a summary sending the stuff from the mortgage showing proof of funds even showing things like that attaching it to the offer letter and saying we're with and then having the loan officer call the cellar's and saying hey we can get this thing to close real fast like this person's ready to go and putting all of those arrows in their quiver taking them out and firing them and saying no no we're the team you want to close with because we can get this done is I think part of the storytelling process. Totally well and if you consider remember like that 15% of contracts were cancelled in July 2025 this is a legitimate concern for buyers or for sellers right now is whether or not a contract will actually be seen through to the closing table. It's interesting I would say that right now we are we are in a period of time where it is now maybe not necessarily happily welcome from the listing agent but it isn't unacceptable any longer to submit your CMA along with your offer to be like hey listen I know I know we're coming in 50 grand below where you have this listed but listen here are the comps that I'm looking at here's the here's the process that we use to come to this number we feel like this is a fair representation of value in the market we can also offer you like you said these levels of assurance that this is a good contract that's going to make it to the closing table like this was not this was unheard of in 2021 when people were making you know properties were getting 15 offers without a single showing yeah you know there was you would be laughed out of the digital room if you submitted an offer below ask with your CMA attached to it you know listing agents would just be like okay we appreciate this we have 10 other offers all over ask with zero inspections and five of them are cash so you're welcome to submit I'm happy to fulfill my duties to show my client but there's not a snowball chance in hell that this is going to get accepted because why would somebody accept this those days are gone friends and you know it's kind of wild to think this but here's just a little reminder we are almost at the inventories of pre-COVID real estate right now like this is that we are in there is a market snapshot right now that if you took the dates off of it could be confused with pre-COVID real estate some dimensions of it not all dimensions and in fact there are a couple of dimensions that are changing that are kind of accentuating this masked buyer market phenomenon one of them are the incentives that we're seeing being tacked onto listings um I'd love to chat a little bit about this are you familiar with with the kind of the incentive phenomenon that is starting to emerge especially in the new build space no so new construction um they're starting to get a trend where new construction homes are being offered with incentives things that don't really feel incentive incentive um you know kind of at first but the more you dig into them you realize what's actually going on here things like um an offer to buy down points on your mortgage things like an offer to upgrade appliances things like an offer to allow a certain level of customization on new builds that wasn't a part of the original package and though these sorts of incentives have existed forever they have started to become a little bit more aggressive and we're starting to see them putting pressure on the existing home stock market such that the incentives that you're getting from um new build construction are making their way into um listing uh existing stock and the place where we see this the most is frankly a direct downstream uh result of the uh of the the the NAR lawsuits the commission lawsuits where we are seeing more and more officially the offer of buyer's agent compensation as a part of the the uh the the listing of the property for sale that you with with your list price you get compensation of your buyer's agent which you know we all know this was the big debate for a long time um so we're starting to see these these sorts of incentives and and i tell you what if the incentive of like purchasing down mortgage points as a part of the uh of the package starts to become the norm in in terms of sellers offering this to buyers i mean i think then we take the mask off like this isn't just this isn't a masked buyer's market anymore even if the numbers are saying otherwise this is a buyer's market if if if sellers are incentivizing their buyers that much to get in the ring yeah that the buy down ideas is an interesting one and i almost wonder if individual home sellers who are not developers could creatively if their property isn't getting the attention it deserves for the price they want they could throw that into the mix and really spice spice up the game a little bit uh that would be a very interesting thing for you know a non-developer primary resident owner uh to to consider doing i also think too is this a great time to sell by meaning owning a home wanting to make that move in the next 12 to 24 months maybe thinking well if i wait for rates to come down further maybe that would spike a more buyers hitting the market certainly more properties would hit the market but prices will certainly go up maybe it does make sense because my property likely has appreciated at least over the last five to seven years maybe it makes sense that yet maybe it's not at its high water mark uh that it was you know three four months ago but perhaps it's a great time when less buyers are here i still sell it at a premium i have a bit more inventory to choose from when i go to buy maybe i maybe i start buying before i even consider selling and knowing that you know if i price correctly and i don't and and i don't shoot for you know a uh trying to sell over my list price which we know is is not as effective right now so maybe we have a more sort of dialed in pricing strategy for my existing property and i realize okay i do i look at the data and say if i have this price correctly how quickly do homes go under contract in my area which jensh ebt if not that can should be able to tell you if not export data from your your MLS and it can do that or your MLS probably can do that as well um but knowing that number is really important because then you can bring that to your home owner and say look i know right now you might be thinking there's not much inventory let's actually show you the inventory in the next area of the town you live in that you want to move to or the next neighborhood or next suburb or here's the next move you're looking to make there's stuff out there right now here's what it's priced at here's how quickly we could probably get yours under contract once you find a property and maybe we can make this happen um a little bit more so again whether or not they do it is is up to them what i think is is this valuable to people is this a value to demonstrate why you're still relevant why you're still needed as an agent and i think it is i think this is whether or not somebody takes action as a home current home owner is just wow my agent came to me with kind of an interesting idea and i hadn't thought of that because of course they haven't thought about it maybe they're looking at inventory right now maybe they're looking at what their homes worth but they aren't necessarily looking about historically where does where do things sit in relation to you know the current trends and i think that's as you were saying what is the value of the agent that can still be can still supersede what they can type into a chat prompt this is about experience this is about knowing the best lenders to work with this is about having your strategy of here's how i'm going to work to get you the buy side first and here's how i'm going to be super aggressive to help make that happen and then here's how we're going to be super aggressive to get the home sold at the same time and i i think this is just a fun conversation to have regardless of the outcome to the actual current homeowner for their first time home buyers i think this is an easy win you know what we're talking about is an easy conversation i think this is actually a great conversation for home current homeowners who are talking about making a switch yeah yeah yeah i mean at the end of the day uh you're you're you're 100% right that there is massive opportunity um on a case by case strategic basis but this is one of those perfect illustrations of why we are not at a place where we can trust uh something like a chat GPT to give us the level of personalized uh advice um and assistance that we need when making this sort of you know the uh a decision with this amount of gravity to it because ultimately the the the true um in my opinion the true value of working with a real estate professional is their specific market experience and insight relative to my specific needs i mean i i i am thrilled to get a chance to work with an agent who's the number one condo agent in all of Chicago but if that person can't apply their um expertise to my specific set of needs then that accolade means nothing to me and so to that end the real you know gold opportunity here is to uh be able to take that expertise and experience and that reputation that you've developed in your market um to be able to interpret the the kind of the smoke signals that are uh this this current market that we find ourselves in and understand how those signals become advantages or disadvantages for your specific client because if you can go to your client or to your prospect if you've got somebody who's on the fence about whether or not they're going to buy or sell you come to them and say listen you know this is this is what i'm reading in our market as to what's going on here's how it applies directly to your decision i mean this is kind of a no-brainer for me like if somebody comes to me and says like this is the best time this is the best chance that you're going to have in the last 10 years right now is the best chance that you have to get the deal that you want on the house of your dreams that will set you up for the life that's going to you know creating the life that you want of course i'm going to sit up and listen to that but if you don't position yourself as somebody who has one handle on exactly what's happening to who has the courage to be able to say look i know you know CNBC and chat GPT are going to tell you this is a sellers market but this is actually a masked buyer's market and here's why and three i know that these are your goals these are the things that are important to you here's how those goals get met in this current market somebody comes to me with that i mean i am more than intrigued i'm ready to start looking because that person is doing exactly what i need them to do for me yeah i bought a car a year and a half ago and i bought a brand new car and i bought it in my companies my company bought it and so it was at a even though i i have my credit is great i still it was at a time when interest rates were higher and so as a result i have this high interest rate on this brand or year and a half old car and i love my car and my intention was to drive it for the next 10 years or more and drive it until you know i've gotten my value out of it i have no intention of trading it in or you know making any sort of switch however i rates have come down recently and i in the process said oh maybe i can refinance it well turns out it's a little bit more challenging to do that in the when it's in a company's name as opposed to an individual so i'm sort of in this position where i reached out to a few different lenders and said hey can we refinance they're like oh it's a little tricky and so it's kind of at a roadblock so it's like okay this is just where i'm at now if the person who's told me the car who knows this is my situation knows all of this information if came to me and said i have i have an i have an solution for you and maybe it's not even an ideal solution but maybe it's hey i can get you a brand new car a year and a half later and you're it's only going to cost you x amount and we're going to get rid of the old one and it's still worth x you know i don't i don't even care if i do it or not i would be so impressed that somebody came to me with some idea that was in my interest or possibly in my interest that i would be like oh i'm never going to another car dealer because this person's thinking about me so and again maybe it's a pipe dream i don't think and this is throwing no shade at my person who sold me my car they're wonderful but these are the kind of things that separate good agents from great agents and if you are just saying hey i've got i've got this thought and maybe it doesn't apply to you but i'd like you to just at least consider it or at least hear what's going on at the very least they're like wow my agent really is on top of things so again whether this results in activity for your clients they're going to be impressed with your activity and probably share that information with other friends and family whose agents are probably thinking you know oh they just bought a home two years ago or three years ago why would they you know why would they consider moving and of course we know that follow up is the fortunes in the follow up so we want to stay in touch and we always want to know what our clients are doing but we know that that's you know if we're not providing this information people are going to seek it out on their own and they're going to get some good some bad because they're going to look it up on either chat gbt or online and they don't have the professional unless they call you which great if you're that agent that they call but you need to make those proactive calls for so Chris this is a great great episode to talk about why it possibly is a good time to consider purchasing and sort of how to position that so i i think it's a great place to wrap up this is definitely an unpopular real estate opinion however backed up with some really good solid logic so thank you on behalf of the audience for coming really with a with a with a with a with a banger this this month this was a good one and we appreciate Chris every month for his opinions and even though they are unpopular they are often accurate so i want everybody to follow Chris you can find him on LinkedIn you can find him on Instagram you can find him on his website chrislincel.com he's super easy to locate you want to follow this guy because he's thinking about the real estate industry he's thinking forward and he's got opinions and ideas he's often asked to speak on these ideas and opinions at conferences which you should go visit him speaking at those uh those endeavors as well and also consider having him speak at some of your own you know conferences so definitely on behalf of the audience thanks Chris on behalf of Chris myself thank you to the audience for listening send this out to other agents in your office other agents that are maybe seeing a slowdown and activity on the by side on this or on the cell side rather this is a great opportunity to you know help energize agents give them a reason to pick up the phone and connect with those clients yet again so um we will see everybody on the next episode thank you to our sponsors please remember to share this and also leave us a review let us know what you think of the show we appreciate that as well chris thank you we will see everybody on the next episode thanks tj talk to you soon
