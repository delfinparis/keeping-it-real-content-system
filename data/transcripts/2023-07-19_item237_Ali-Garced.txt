[00:02:59] and you've heard enough from me. Let's get to the main event. My conversation with the great Allie Garcette.
[00:03:19] Okay, today on the show, we have Allie Garcette from Allie, the agent brokerage with the XP. Now,
[00:03:25] let me tell you more about Allie. Now Allie Garcette, who is known as Allie, the agent on all social
[00:03:31] media platforms, developed checklist systems and processes to be able to close 55 transactions
[00:03:38] in her first two years as an agent. Super amazing. All while being a solo agent and in her first year,
[00:03:44] and she still had a full-time job at the time. Amazing. She had more leads in time. So she grew her
[00:03:50] REALTOR downline, her team. She developed this, listen to this everybody. This is so cool. She developed
[00:03:56] 180 step onboarding checklist that her agents all over the country use and also has a 200 step
[00:04:03] checklist on working with buyers and sellers from start to finish. So agents can treat this as an
[00:04:08] actual business. And she gives these checklists and systems and processes to all of the REALTORS
[00:04:13] that partner with her. She's a fanatic of tracking her numbers. And so she has two excel sheets
[00:04:18] that she tracks. One is her hourly pay broken down by category. How much she makes per hour working
[00:04:23] with each seller by her referral, which is really smart. And the other tracker tracks how many
[00:04:28] conversations she has every day, week and month that lead to appointments and closings. She is
[00:04:33] more than happy to share these trackers with anyone in our audience that asks for it. So guess what,
[00:04:38] you're going to ask for it. I want you all to grab your phone unless you're driving. Don't do it
[00:04:42] then. But grab your phone. Go to whatever social platform Instagram. I know she is big on. And
[00:04:47] just do a search for Ali, the agent, Al. So Al, the agent, you'll find her. She's super easy to find
[00:04:53] and partner or message her and she will get you that those checklists and you can even learn a
[00:04:59] lot more from by the way, she is also a veteran of the armed forces. So we want to honor her
[00:05:05] for her service. She's too humble to say that, but that's what she has done for our country. And we
[00:05:10] think her for that Ali. Welcome to oh, and by the way, also follow her on her website, which is
[00:05:15] Garcede Realty.com J G A R C E D Realty.com. She has tons of resources for agents on there as well.
[00:05:24] So follow her on social media Ali, the agent and then follow her on her website. Garcede Realty.
[00:05:29] Ali, welcome to the show. D day, that's the best intro I've ever received. I really appreciate that.
[00:05:35] Can we say that this is this is such a fun episode for me because Ali sent a message in to our
[00:05:44] podcast not that long ago in the last couple of months. And she was mentioned and we always love
[00:05:50] when when people tell us that our show helped them grow their business and it appears that our
[00:05:56] show has helped you. And I am so, so honored to have a listener now on as a guest. We've done that
[00:06:03] just a few times in the about 500 episodes. So this is a big, big win for me. I am so happy that
[00:06:09] you're here. And also you just seem like a really fun person and you do a lot. I'm really a big fan
[00:06:15] of yours now. So I'm glad you reached out to us so that we can now have this conversation. And
[00:06:20] it was an instant. Yes, I was like, we got to have her on because this is amazing. But let's,
[00:06:25] let's start at the very beginning of the journey because you haven't been doing this all that long
[00:06:29] and yet you have a masked a huge team. You've done a ton of transactions and you are now teaching
[00:06:36] agents how to duplicate the success that you've had. So well, but let's start at the very beginning
[00:06:41] before you knew how to do any of this. So how did you get into real estate? Was it immediately
[00:06:45] after leaving military or you know, tell me about sort of how that worked? Yeah. So I actually got
[00:06:51] into real estate first through investing and I purchased my first, you know, condo because I was
[00:06:55] active duty Air Force for a decade. I recently separated. So I started investing. I realized
[00:07:02] that I liked it and not all the agents were, you know, you're not all three to equal.
[00:07:09] Yeah, yeah, we'll say that way. Some agents were great. Some agents are I was like, hey,
[00:07:15] did you ever even go on the property? Anyway, it doesn't matter. So as I knew they wanted to
[00:07:22] separate from military. I was I was unhappy. You know, I was looking at the people who I would be
[00:07:27] replacing the journal, Lieutenant Colonel's and I didn't want to be where they were. That's not
[00:07:32] the life that I wanted to live. So I was thinking, you know, how I knowing that I want to separate from
[00:07:37] the military, knowing that I want to run away from something, why am I going to run toward? You know,
[00:07:41] what what should I do? Should I I want to start my own business? Because I don't want to work
[00:07:44] for somebody else. I'm kind of done with W2s. I'm kind of done with deploying. I've been out of
[00:07:48] the country three years. I don't want to be out of the country another three in order just to get
[00:07:52] the military retirement pay not worth it for me. So I was thinking of all sorts of things. My wife
[00:07:58] in the background was like, Hey, how about you become a REALTOR? How about you become a REALTOR?
[00:08:01] REALTOR, REALTOR. And I was like, no, I don't like kitchens. I don't like cutesy stuff. I don't
[00:08:06] wear heels. I certainly don't dress up. Like this is no. I think I'll pass on that. It's all it's
[00:08:12] selling sunset, right? Like the TV says, sure. But the the more that I started listening to podcasts,
[00:08:20] that's exactly what I did first. Hey, before I become a licensed REALTOR, let me see what the
[00:08:26] struggles are of agents. Let me see what the process is like. Let me see. Let me just see. So
[00:08:31] what do you know? Podcasts are free. I stumbled across yours. And I've been listening to yours
[00:08:35] every single day. I am not kidding. So that is so, that is that is flattery will get you everywhere,
[00:08:41] Ali. So thank you. I you are now my absolute favorite guest I've ever had on the show. But I
[00:08:49] say that to every guest. So, but, but no, but thank you. And I think we are not the only show out
[00:08:54] there. I'm glad you found ours. There are some other really excellent ones. Real estate rock stars
[00:08:59] is very good. Massive agent is very good. So shout out to those other podcasts that are helping
[00:09:06] people as well. I am just one of one of many. But I am I'm glad that that and talk about because
[00:09:13] there are there are lots of great shows out there. How did that help prepare you? Was it just
[00:09:19] sort of understanding this is the path and this is what it takes to sort of succeed?
[00:09:24] Yeah. So, knowing that the that the barrier was low, right? The barrier to entry to be a REALTOR
[00:09:30] and anybody can do it as long as you're not a villain and you pass the test. Great. You know,
[00:09:35] that that's the pool is very large. So, as I was listening to podcasts that interview top agents
[00:09:43] that know how to run a business. That's when I realized that's when the light turned on for me
[00:09:48] as far as it being an actual business. It's not showing homes and talking about how cute a house is
[00:09:53] which is like not my thing. You know, it's like the you know. So, as I realize that there are
[00:09:59] funnels and there's a way to scale it and there's a way to automate stuff. So, that way you're not
[00:10:03] answering the same questions over and over again. You can you provide the same level of service.
[00:10:09] Actually, I think better if you compile all the frequently asked questions and make a video series
[00:10:15] for buyers, for sellers, for referrals, for agents, for everything, that will buy you back so much
[00:10:21] of your time. So, that's when I realized, hey, there's a process to this and I that's how I want
[00:10:27] to run my business and that's when I realized it's not just oh showing doors which all quiet
[00:10:31] think it is. So, that's when I got my license and I got my license in 2021. I was still active
[00:10:39] duty air force because again, I'm very risk averse. I didn't want to I didn't want to separate from
[00:10:44] the military and then at that point after that, after I'm without a job, realize that I don't even
[00:10:49] like being a REALTOR. So, I gave myself one year as because I had one year left in my active duty
[00:10:56] air force commitment before I separated as major and I gave myself one year, can I make as much
[00:11:01] as I'm making right now in the military? And at the time, it was $107,000. I was like, I just want to
[00:11:07] which by the way, that is a tough tough barrier to clear in your first year as an agent. Like that is
[00:11:13] that is a great salary in general, right? Like $107,000. It's probably not enough for people that want
[00:11:20] to earn more of course, but for you know, all intensive purposes, that's a really good salary and not
[00:11:25] an easy one to just go out and get. And so to give yourself a year is really putting the pressure
[00:11:30] on you to sort of make it happen. Yeah, yeah. So I told everyone I knew, hey, I'm getting my license.
[00:11:36] I'm not licensed yet, but I'm getting my license. And I have experience, right? Like I had, I've been
[00:11:41] purchasing properties. So people knew, start already started making that connection. Alley, the agent,
[00:11:46] which I was a federal agent for the air force. So that was my handle and the military thought I was
[00:11:51] like me being a special agent. And of course, I'm like, no, I'm a real estate agent now. So
[00:11:56] as I started telling everyone that I knew and I matched that salary of $107,000 by month eight of
[00:12:04] me being a REALTOR solo, part time. I was still traveling in the military and everything too. I was
[00:12:09] like, it was completely unsustainable. I am very much so aware. Like I could not do both at the
[00:12:13] at the same time forever. So knowing that I matched that at month eight. And then of course, I
[00:12:20] continued making more because of the, that's how sales work. At that point, I realized one,
[00:12:27] I matched the income, which is what I wanted to do. I made it less time. And I didn't have the stress
[00:12:33] of millets being in the military, which I was not the biggest fan of. And I liked it. So then I
[00:12:40] double down, I separated from the air force. And now I have since then, like grown the, I don't
[00:12:51] so downline, I guess, like I've grown the downline to 30 agents and we're growing at like three
[00:12:55] agents a month. And I have all of the checklist because as I was doing it, I didn't want somebody
[00:13:00] else to ask me the question of, hey, what's the step again? And me not know how am I going to be a
[00:13:04] resource to them if I don't know. So I'm like, hey, I'm going to as I go through every single hurdle,
[00:13:08] I'm going to add it to the checklist and I do everything on Trello. It's free. So I add it to
[00:13:14] the Trello checklist and I give them all access. And it's, it takes some step by step.
[00:13:18] And by the way, I should a little shout out to Trello. I since the beginning of my podcast,
[00:13:23] I have only used Trello to manage all of my guests information and in our workflow. And there are
[00:13:29] other systems out there. But if you're looking for a visual system to basically manage projects
[00:13:36] or to do's, there aren't a lot of them out there. And it's basically a cool way for those of us
[00:13:41] who are a little bit more visually minded to be able to to see. I used to work at a software
[00:13:46] company and we all the developers, there was this big whiteboard with all these stickies. And if
[00:13:51] you've ever watched a movie where it's, you know, Device offer developers usually can see this
[00:13:55] thing where there's stickies and they move them around. And it just from a visual perspective,
[00:13:59] it was better for me to be able to see everything. So shout out to Trello. Allie uses it,
[00:14:05] countless of her other agents are sorry of our guests have used it and our agents here at R4. And
[00:14:10] I will say to your point about accumulating sort of like frequently asked questions from
[00:14:18] from your clients that even if you're a solo agent and you don't have a team, you need to put
[00:14:23] this together for yourself because it will allow you to copy and paste responses that are to
[00:14:28] frequently asked questions when you get those texts and emails from your client. You know,
[00:14:32] we have we have almost 800 agents here at R4M and one of the smartest things we did for our own
[00:14:38] to be able to support our own agents is obviously, you know, if we got 800 phone calls a day,
[00:14:42] we wouldn't be able to do much support for our brokers are sorry, they'll allow everyone's
[00:14:46] a broker so I'll say REALTOR for our REALTOR's. So we created a frequent, basically a knowledge base,
[00:14:52] a wiki that our agents can use. And so having that even for just yourself is so important so that
[00:14:59] you like Allie was saying, you know, she asked wants to scale her business and she can't be doing
[00:15:04] as many one to one interactions if she can automate some of that stuff. So cheers to you for that.
[00:15:10] That is that is really, really amazing. I want to dive into some of these checklists too because
[00:15:14] I have I have had a lot of people on the show over the years with checklists but nobody's
[00:15:19] talked about it in a long time and if I were a practicing agent, I would be using checklists.
[00:15:24] No question about it. Also, I just want to say as a quick aside, just as a personal thing,
[00:15:28] we were just talking before we started the show Allie and I and she I won't mention where she's
[00:15:33] from just in case, you know, there's a privacy thing but she and I have actually been to her
[00:15:38] Air Force base. And so the funny part is I said, I was actually at a base near where you are and
[00:15:45] you know, I've been I talked about it. So I have literally been to where she worked and I mean,
[00:15:50] what are the odds of that? So anyway, just kind of a funny thing 20 years ago, but I was still there.
[00:15:55] But anyway, okay, let's talk about these checklists because I think there are, you know,
[00:16:00] it's one of those things that we just assume every agent uses and has but I think most agents don't.
[00:16:05] So let's talk about sort of what they're there to do and how they work and how you created them.
[00:16:11] Yeah, so I started creating them with as I was going through each transaction. There is some
[00:16:17] forward thinking that you can, you know, try to predict, you know, what could happen but
[00:16:20] every transaction goes so different every single time. So it's frequently asked questions was my
[00:16:26] number one. As soon as I as soon as any client buyer seller referral anybody asked me a question,
[00:16:32] I would drop that same question like copy and paste it into the trullo. And then at that point,
[00:16:38] if I got questions that same question over and over again, I would make a video out of that because
[00:16:43] it's one thing to respond back copy and paste a text. But it's another thing for them to see you
[00:16:49] explaining it to you. Even if you're not saying, not personalizing and saying, hey Cindy, you
[00:16:54] asked this question, this is the answer. They even if they realize this same video goes to all
[00:17:00] of the buyers, goes to all of the sellers, they realize, oh, this is a whole business for her and she
[00:17:05] treats us as such, you know, this, there's a difference when you're just scrambling and answering a
[00:17:10] phone call, which by the way, I do not answer any phone call. I'm on track to triple my military
[00:17:15] income on my second year, first year as a full time agent, tripling my income and I don't answer
[00:17:21] phone calls. I love it. Yeah, unless like it's it's already a client who are under contract and
[00:17:27] there's some something, you know, then at that point, I will, but every every other call is spam,
[00:17:32] you know, and it's it's just a waste of my time. I don't even want to tally up how many hours
[00:17:36] or minutes I spend over a course of a week back when I did answer phone calls answering these
[00:17:41] phone calls that were just robo, you know, calls. So I don't answer calls. Actually, a quick checklist
[00:17:47] on that is I have an iPhone, but I'm sure you could do this on on the any other phone that you have.
[00:17:53] Whenever you get a phone coming in, a phone call coming in, you can either respond with those
[00:17:56] auto responses that the iPhone has. It says, I'm in a meeting, I'll call you back shortly. I
[00:18:01] rephrased it and I say, hey, I'm currently with the client at the moment, I'm giving them
[00:18:04] my full attention. Can I help you with anything via text and you brilliant. Yeah, usually it's a
[00:18:10] question that it can be resolved via text and or sometimes, which is a lot of the times I know
[00:18:17] REALTORS, I know you hear you hear me on this where a lot of times it's a question that the
[00:18:21] client just all of a sudden, you know, wanted answer right away when they have access to the answer,
[00:18:26] you know, give them a little bit of time for them to do their own research. They will find their
[00:18:29] own answer. I'm not saying that they're going to run their whole transaction, but a lot of times
[00:18:33] it's, hey, what school district is this in? That's on Google, you know, like that, can I help you
[00:18:38] via text that adds that extra hurdle? And again, not saying it's like losing any client customer
[00:18:44] service, but it's, in fact, I really think it's the opposite where, hey, I can't just ask my
[00:18:50] REALTOR any question at that point. I'm asking them to bend over backward and I don't even, I lose
[00:18:54] respect to that REALTOR because clearly they have no time since they're answering all of my questions.
[00:18:59] So it's, it's treating everything as a checklist anyway, going back to the original question of
[00:19:04] checklist. And so for buyers, sellers, as I had each transaction, I would go through the process,
[00:19:11] what do I do before I even meet with them? What do I do once I meet with them? What do I do to get
[00:19:16] them under contract? What do I do once we're under contract? What are some common, you know,
[00:19:20] occurrences that happen? What are the timelines that I know crap need to know? And how do I follow
[00:19:26] up with them after, because after the transactions over to make sure they become a repeat customer
[00:19:31] client? So I, after I had those at first, it was just written on Trello, I then turned those
[00:19:38] into a video. So I have a buyer video packet. I put all the videos on one pdf, they all go back
[00:19:43] to my YouTube. And that way it's like a, it's a series. And then same thing for sellers and same
[00:19:49] thing for agents now for onboarding. I mean, we have a 180 step onboarding Trello checklist for all
[00:19:54] REALTOR's. I love it. I love it. And we should also talk about sort of the ancillary benefit of
[00:20:02] putting this information together, which is after practicing herself exclusively, she was like,
[00:20:09] you know, this, and I'm not telling your story, but, but I'm just making up the story in my head.
[00:20:14] But something to the effective, oh, by the way, this could be useful to other agents who haven't yet
[00:20:18] put these materials together. And Ali by now has so many agents asking her, hey, teach me how you do
[00:20:26] that because number one, she did 55 transactions in her first two years, which is insane. We all know,
[00:20:31] this while working a full time job, we should mention. And being traveling for the Air Force,
[00:20:36] that doing all of the responsibilities there, defending our country, and oh, by the way,
[00:20:43] doing all this, all this transactions. And she, she systematized everything. And now all these
[00:20:47] agents have reached out to her because they see what she's doing on social media. And they see the
[00:20:52] the sort of processes and systems she's built. And now they're asking her for that information. And
[00:21:01] she can now focus a lot of her time on coaching and teaching and still produce by referring a
[00:21:07] business all over the country and referrals coming both ways. So I think that in and of itself
[00:21:14] is such a cool thing because it gives you this other way you can also grow as a REALTOR. And more,
[00:21:20] we'll call it a modern REALTOR, you know, being mostly on the referral side simply by providing
[00:21:26] value to agents all over the country. So it's like it opened up this whole another business for you,
[00:21:31] which is so, so cool. Yeah. And as you stated before, I tracked my numbers. I didn't,
[00:21:40] because I want to know how much I make per hour, right? I want to compare it. Yeah, back in my,
[00:21:45] back in the days of like me being stressed out over leaving the Air Force, should I leave it?
[00:21:49] No, I was miserable. How am I, I just wanted again to compare it to what I was making before? I
[00:21:55] didn't want to lose money. So I created a spreadsheet and it's just Excel. It's nothing crazy.
[00:22:01] Anybody could do it, but I just have it looking pretty. So if you want to message me, but I created
[00:22:05] a spreadsheet where every single client that I ever had, I categorized how many hours am I driving
[00:22:11] around? How many hours am I negotiating with the cross sale or across agent? How many hours am I doing,
[00:22:17] you know, under negotiations, sitting there in inspections, whatever it is? So tally every single
[00:22:23] hour that you spend per client for all the sellers, add them all up, you know, divide by the
[00:22:27] commission. Yeah, what is it by the way? What is it? What is it? What is it average out to for a
[00:22:32] seller in a buyer? I'd love to know that number. Those numbers. Yeah. So every business is different.
[00:22:37] My business is very surprisingly, because I thought, you know, listings are everything.
[00:22:40] Listing is life. Listings was my lowest at $162 per hour. Wow. That was my, why is that, do you think?
[00:22:49] Because I was sitting at the open houses. There were some REALTORS that wanted me and not
[00:22:54] anybody else. They wanted me to be at the open house. And of course, that's a conversation that I can,
[00:22:59] that I sense that have told them, I don't, I don't do that. Plus, it doesn't even help sell your
[00:23:03] house. It's for REALTORS to get more to get leads. It's not good. You know what? By the way, by the way,
[00:23:09] what an honest and amazing thing to tell somebody, because they are going to think, well,
[00:23:14] this my friends, REALTORS, setting all these open houses for me. And what's Ali doing for me?
[00:23:18] And all you do have to say is, by the way, there's a little sort of secret in the industry that you,
[00:23:23] you can easily Google and find out that I'm telling the truth here is, it doesn't actually sell your
[00:23:27] house. It's great for me to get leads, though. So, yeah, so perfect thing. And I think, you know,
[00:23:33] be, be being able to tell a seller or a buyer, you know, any of the sort of trade secrets,
[00:23:40] which aren't even really secrets, I think is so important to building trust and, and intimacy
[00:23:45] with your clients, because now all of a sudden they're like, Ali's telling me something,
[00:23:49] no other REALTORS told me. Yeah. And that, that really, it comes with knowing,
[00:23:55] presenting yourself as the person that you are no matter where you're at. So, the clients that
[00:24:00] you get will be are already attracted to you. They know you as a person. You don't have to pretend
[00:24:04] to be somebody else. So, yeah, at the lowest, I was making a, I make $162 per seller, $360 per
[00:24:14] referral. And $453 per hour working with a buyer. Wow. The complete impossible.
[00:24:22] I, I, it's, I know it's because I have, because of your checklist, because of the check.
[00:24:27] I've perfected that checklist. Yeah. So it's, I have it down to a tee. Like they don't even need to
[00:24:31] answer any questions. The common, the common response that I get from buyers is,
[00:24:36] Ali, you answered my questions before I even knew I had them. Perfect.
[00:24:41] Exactly. Can you add that in my Google? Can you give me a five-star review of my Google and
[00:24:45] say exactly that? Yes. Yes. And by the way, my boss, when I bought my first condo, now he's my boss,
[00:24:51] but, but we were just friends. And he was my REALTOR because, you know, that's how it works. And I,
[00:24:56] once I started working here, I had said to him, I'm like, you were a really good REALTOR. It was my
[00:25:00] first experience. This is like 2005. And I said, well, I couldn't quite put my finger on why he was
[00:25:07] so good. And I said, and I said, what was your philosophy back then? You know, and he goes, I never
[00:25:12] wanted somebody to have to call me first. I wanted to give them the information before they even knew
[00:25:17] there was a question. And that way they wouldn't bother me. They wouldn't call me. And also, I would
[00:25:21] seem like a professional. So yeah. No, 100%. And now the, the REALTOR's that are like using these
[00:25:29] checklists that I have for the buyers, for sellers, for referrals for everything is on there.
[00:25:34] There's one agent that joined the crew less than a year ago. She joined from, she switched brokerages.
[00:25:41] And at the previous brokerage, what she made that entire, in an entire year, she made that in two
[00:25:46] months because she was able to scale. Like, it's, it's not, it's not rocket science. You know, it's,
[00:25:52] hey, what are these questions that I'm always getting? What question bothers me? Think about that. Like,
[00:25:56] what is the one question that I hate answering? You have to make a video out of it. So, and then make
[00:26:01] that video, link it to some resources that again, you could descend to buyers and sellers.
[00:26:07] Gosh, I absolutely love all of that. This idea of systematizing and, and having processes. But
[00:26:14] I am still fascinated that buyers were actually the most profitable for you. Why is that? What,
[00:26:20] do you think it's because the checklist was so, and we're talking about the pre, pre checklist,
[00:26:25] working with a buyer, making sure you know, everything they possibly could ever look for and want
[00:26:30] and need, their musts, their sheds, their whatever. And, and then going, okay, I know so much about
[00:26:36] what you want. I'm not going to be showing you 25 properties. We can probably narrow it down to three
[00:26:40] or four or was, I'm assuming that's kind of how that worked or am I wrong? That's exactly it. Yeah.
[00:26:46] So, major, being that I was military, I, all of my clients, I've only ever done V.A. loans. I've
[00:26:55] the rest were only V.A. I've like never done conventional. So, the, all the clients that I was
[00:27:00] getting was from my military sphere. They were all out of state because they're military is
[00:27:04] PCSing them, removing them. And they're all out of state buyers. I'm the one driving on my own time.
[00:27:09] I'm not meeting with somebody there. So, I had to schedule, I had to make a process out of that,
[00:27:14] right? I have to take a video of the outside of the inside of the neighborhood as I'm driving in,
[00:27:17] driving out, uploaded all to a Google Drive, given the link. They have access to Paws. We wind,
[00:27:22] zoom in, zoom out. And that is way better than a FaceTime or scheduling a Zoom call between
[00:27:29] spouses and me. No, that's, that's, that doesn't work. So, I save time that way.
[00:27:34] And you ever, by the way, I wrote quick. Did you ever use the same video for multiple clients?
[00:27:39] Because you could make that video once. And if the place is still on the market, you could
[00:27:43] possibly use it for, again, assuming that people are looking for the same kind of property.
[00:27:47] I guess you could do that. Right. I could, I never actually had that.
[00:27:52] That never came up. That would have been nice. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
[00:27:56] So, and, and it's being very upfront with them. And I feel like I can be with my military
[00:28:01] clients. And now people that reach out to me, they already know my personality. They know how I don't
[00:28:05] have to, there's no front. I curse. I don't dress up. I will show up in flip flops, you know, like,
[00:28:11] or gym attire. And that's, and I will get you your house. So, I, the biggest thing I say is because
[00:28:17] I was predominantly a buyer's agent back when it was the hardest to be a buyer's agent when I first
[00:28:22] got started. And I got all of my offers accepted on the first one except for two different clients,
[00:28:27] which took three attempts. It was, and that's because I go above and beyond. And I tell the clients
[00:28:33] before that I'm like, hey, I will do whatever it takes to get, to make sure that you get your offer
[00:28:38] accepted. So, eat your friends that are placing 12, 13 offers to get a property accepted.
[00:28:45] That's not going to be the case with you. And I can say that confidently because, again,
[00:28:50] that barrier to becoming a REALTOR is very low. That is the one time I make outbound calls.
[00:28:55] I just so answer inbound. So, I call the listing agent. I'm like, hey, what can we do to get our
[00:28:59] offer accepted? My buyer is your perfect question. Not, not, not, yeah, you're basically saying,
[00:29:05] hey, whatever, whatever you're seeing out there, what can we do because we want this home? So,
[00:29:10] what can we do to make this work perfect question? Because it really, there's a presupposition
[00:29:15] there that they're going to help you make it. And if you don't think they can't, if they won't,
[00:29:19] they won't. But you're basically saying, hey, I want this, what, what does it take? And it forces
[00:29:24] the person to answer that question in their head. And then hopefully they'll share that with you
[00:29:28] and give you the secret little tip that you need to take it over the top.
[00:29:32] Absolutely. And then, and then I tell the clients, before even call the listing agent,
[00:29:37] I tell the clients a couple of things. One is, as we go over your specific criteria,
[00:29:42] you will realize that you're not looking at 20 homes. There are only four to five homes that
[00:29:47] actually meet what you're looking for. So, as you're looking at houses that don't meet all those
[00:29:53] criteria, make sure that it's a level seven out of 10 before you send it my way, because I don't
[00:29:58] waste your time or my time. And I'm very honest up front. I'm like, I don't want to waste my time or
[00:30:03] your time going to these properties. If you don't even really feel like you're going to place an offer.
[00:30:08] And then I tell them that I'm going to reach out to the listing agent and do whatever it takes to
[00:30:13] get their offer accepted. So, do not be surprised when your offer is accepted. I don't want you
[00:30:17] backing out because and I get that makes you look bad. Yeah. Exactly. And I tell them I am a new
[00:30:24] REALTOR. The last thing I want to do is ruin my reputation by being that agent that backs out.
[00:30:30] You know, gets gets you offer in and then backs out. And so, I'm I tell every single client that,
[00:30:35] like I do not ruin my reputation for me. My reputation is the only thing that I have. You know,
[00:30:40] so and and at that point it it becomes a team thing, right? They're like, oh, wow. Yeah, I don't
[00:30:47] want to just treat my agent as somebody that can just throw offers here left and there, Spaghetti at
[00:30:52] the wall. That it become I become more human to them instead of just somebody that will you know,
[00:30:59] robot that's going to be doing work for them. Plus, I also think too, like as the thinking about
[00:31:05] it from the buyer's perspective, does a buyer want to go through the emotional ups and downs of
[00:31:10] losing 12 deals, 12 offers for 12 properties? Like they are going to I can't even imagine how
[00:31:17] emotionally draining that would be for a buyer. And certainly, you know, I guess, you know,
[00:31:22] REALTOR whose career is mad at enough could maybe survive their reputation to their buyer,
[00:31:27] you know, just going, well, this is the way the market is, whatever. I'm sure there's a way
[00:31:30] to talk through it, but it's certainly not a good experience for a buyer to go through that. And
[00:31:35] not and also you don't have the time to do that. You don't have time to write 12 offers. And I
[00:31:40] mean, it's too much. Right. So any other tips, I'm sorry, I have to ask because I'm so fascinated by
[00:31:46] this, how any other tips to get offers accepted other than, hey, Mr. List or Mrs. Listing agent,
[00:31:53] what can we do to make this happen? Any other sort of like in the way you present the packages to
[00:32:00] your to the to the seller to the seller's agent, what are you actually doing? Is there any little
[00:32:06] tips and tricks that you'd recommend to agents to help get their offers, you know, because there
[00:32:11] are some agents that just don't answer the phone when other agents are calling in because they
[00:32:15] got 20 other offers. So are there things that you're laughing because this you deal with this
[00:32:20] all the time. So when you don't get someone on the phone or when they're not willing to sort of
[00:32:24] give you any sort of, you know, help, what are you doing in addition to that to get these offers accepted?
[00:32:30] I love this question, DJ. So first, I talk to buy the buyers about it, right? Like for buyers and
[00:32:38] for sellers, I have seller email number one through six, buyer email number one through six in the
[00:32:43] packet that comes out and buyer email number two is all of like my secrets, right? Because buyer
[00:32:48] email number one is for any buyer. If they don't want to work with me, they won't get buyer email
[00:32:51] number two. Buying number two is once where you and I are working together in buyer email number two,
[00:32:55] there's that PDF that has my whole video video series. One of those videos is seven ways to make your
[00:33:01] to get your offer accepted. Again, it links back to my YouTube. So although I think I have that
[00:33:06] unlisted because it's just for my clients, but I'm going to share this DJ. So in some states,
[00:33:12] they do not require non-refundable earnest money. How like how important to the seller and how can
[00:33:21] you wow a seller by saying wow, no one else is offering non-refundable earnest money. These
[00:33:27] are more serious because earnest money, good faith money is is it's kind of nothing. It's
[00:33:34] basically nothing. Yeah. Anything can happen and the buyers will get their money back at least. Of
[00:33:41] course. Well, that's that's the joke of it all at least here in Illinois, like there's almost no
[00:33:45] way for anybody to actually keep earnest money. So it's all a big kind of like what are we doing here?
[00:33:50] Yeah. Yeah. So why not offer something and I'm not talking thousands of dollars. I'm talking
[00:33:56] 500 bucks and then that also gives the the buyers the buy in. Oh wait, do I really want to miss out
[00:34:02] on 500 bucks? Do I really like this property enough? That's number one. Number two is yeah.
[00:34:08] Number two is the escalation clause. Of course, hey, if you have another offer, we will beat it by
[00:34:12] 500 a thousand, you know, and then of course, talk into the listing agent too is is 500 bucks or is
[00:34:18] that extra amount of the escalation clause even worth it and have them decide, you know, if they don't
[00:34:23] want to respond to you, that's that's fine, which I will say actually right now is if you get a
[00:34:28] listing agent that doesn't respond, then send them a video text. Don't send them a text because
[00:34:32] how many texts do you get a day? You know, that's just words. That's people just trying to solicit
[00:34:37] business. No, send them a video text. Hey, what's up DJ? My name is Ali Garza, I'm with the eXp
[00:34:43] royalty and I don't want to bother you. So I just want to send you this quick video. I have buyers
[00:34:47] that are very interested in one, two, three main street. What can we do to get their offer accepted?
[00:34:51] Please give me a call back when you can. Thank you so much. That's it. Like four seconds.
[00:34:56] And do you do that like on loom or bomb bomb or are you sending a video text or what how do you
[00:35:01] what's the way that you do that? It was doing it on bomb bomb, but that bomb bomb creates one
[00:35:07] another layer of friction where they have to click. Yeah, that the click and then it goes to the
[00:35:11] link. So I just send it, especially if it's iPhone iPhone. So it's so easy. I just send an actual
[00:35:16] video from my phone to them as a text message. Perfect. Yeah. And what and I know you can't see the
[00:35:23] open rates on those you'd be able to see bomb bomb. But what do you think the open rates are when
[00:35:29] you send those video chats to other other agents? It's got to be pretty high. I'm guessing. Yeah.
[00:35:34] 100. Oh yeah. Because one they see because because everyone else the barrier is so low. Everyone
[00:35:40] else leaves it at a phone call leaves it at a voicemail. I don't answer voice. I don't even listen
[00:35:44] to voice mail. If it's that important, you will call me back or you'll text me because even my
[00:35:47] voice mail says text me. Yeah. So and everyone else just does a text which now all text seems so
[00:35:56] spammy. Make yourself look like a human. Yeah. And showcase your personality. You don't have to be
[00:36:02] like the whole bubbly person. But if you're real, if I said if I get a video text message, that shows
[00:36:07] me that that person is serious. They created a whole video for me, even if it was four seconds.
[00:36:12] Now I know what they look like. I already like them. You know, I maybe I do want to work with them.
[00:36:16] Maybe I do want to trust them to get their offer accepted all that. So that's number three, I guess.
[00:36:25] Number four, I actually have seven different ways in my video. And this has been a
[00:36:29] while since I've actually worked with with buyers. Because then my second year I work mainly
[00:36:33] sellers when it was harder to be a seller is a listing agent. But I'm telling you though,
[00:36:40] just as you're trying to find a few of those other tips that you don't have to have them all in
[00:36:44] front of you, of course. But I know what the title of this episode is going to be and is going to
[00:36:48] be believe it or not, it's more profitable to work with buyers. And everybody's this is going to be
[00:36:53] our most downloaded episode ever because nobody is going to be like, there's no way that's possible.
[00:36:58] And we are going to show that it is. So I love these tips. I do have a question. I wanted to ask you
[00:37:04] when it comes to submitting back to submitting offers. What do we think about love letters? And for
[00:37:09] those of us that don't know what a love letter is, this is when you have your clients write a
[00:37:14] letter about how much they love the house and what they plan to do with it. And how grateful they
[00:37:20] be if they offered get accepted, you know, basically a lot of, you know, interpersonal sort of stuff.
[00:37:26] And there's there's debate on this. There's there's lots of debates on possibly is it even
[00:37:30] violating fair housing. So there's a whole sort of compliance issue. Some states are okay with it.
[00:37:35] Others aren't. But it's controversial topic. What do you think about those?
[00:37:42] As before, I got a license. I loved love letters because I was an investor. Like, hey, I want to
[00:37:47] talk at the heartstrings and, you know, all of that. But now that I'm a REALTOR, first of all,
[00:37:52] $25,000 fine. I don't, I'm not going to mess with that. I'm not going to mess with that. So I do,
[00:37:58] I switch my opinion on that. I do not like love letters. Plus with a love letter, yes, there are
[00:38:04] some things that you cannot say to not violate any housing rules. But even I don't understand,
[00:38:10] because even when you sign it, even if you, if you add a photo, they see what you look like, you know,
[00:38:16] they see what that couple looks like or what that person type of dog anything. And when they sign
[00:38:20] their names, you could judge based off of their names. So if a judge really is what you're saying.
[00:38:28] Yeah, it's just too risky. Wait, too risky. Yeah. So I, plus, yeah, you don't need it. I get my
[00:38:33] offers accepted. You know, that's, that is such a, yeah, right. You don't need it anyway. But it's
[00:38:37] such a strong point for those of us that are still doing love letters. Let's, let's just think
[00:38:41] about a scenario here where you don't want to lose your license. You don't want to get in trouble.
[00:38:44] And certain states are more lenient about it than others. But let's think about this. They see
[00:38:49] the last name being signed. And let's just say it's Garcia just, just choosing a name at random.
[00:38:54] They can make an assumption based on that last name and ethnicity, you know, where that person's
[00:38:59] from, you can, somebody, people can make assumptions about education, finances, and all of a sudden,
[00:39:04] now we're into this weird fair housing gray area where we haven't technically violated
[00:39:10] the fair housing because we're not saying, hey, this is so and so Garcia and look at all the
[00:39:14] cool stuff associated with that name. It's, but people do make those assumptions because we're
[00:39:19] just human beings who'd like to put people in categories. And all of a sudden now, whatever we
[00:39:23] think about that last name, Garcia might start flooding into our decision making strategy as a
[00:39:28] seller or as a seller's agent. And so you just don't want to be part of that at all because maybe
[00:39:33] even five years later, if your client feels like, oh, I bought a bad property and they talk to
[00:39:39] an attorney and they're like, oh, look at this. We can make an assumption that, you know, based your
[00:39:43] REALTOR sort of did the wrong thing, even though it wasn't intentionally done for the wrong reason.
[00:39:48] So you just made a very, very compelling case to just, let's just play on the on the, on the safe side
[00:39:55] and not give somebody the opportunity to make a decision that possibly could violate fair housing.
[00:40:02] Yeah, smart. Yeah. Along with that, too, what typically goes on a love letter, a photo. So now
[00:40:08] they're judging based off of what you look like with the clothes, the background, you know, like what's
[00:40:12] what's what's on what's on what's on what's on are you in. So everything and the timing itself, even
[00:40:18] if even if it was black and white, like I know that this one, you know, would not violate any housing
[00:40:23] rules. The timing never works out. So I don't know, you know, because as soon as we're placing an offer
[00:40:28] or my clients want to look at a property, want to want to make an offer and a property,
[00:40:33] the at that point, then they're going to snail mail, you know, or maybe find an email that they
[00:40:37] might or might or might not open, then they're going to snail mail. At that point, we're already under
[00:40:41] contract. That it's just, you know, it's so no, I don't like love letters.
[00:40:47] Now that makes that makes perfect sense. How important is it to develop relationships with
[00:40:52] other REALTORS in your market? Because of course, love letters, we talked about potential
[00:40:58] fair housing violations, but having strong relationships with other REALTORS does possibly help
[00:41:04] grease the wheels because we like to work with people we like in a lot of cases that may help
[00:41:11] push you over the edge if you have similar or various, you know, identical offers possibly. So I'm
[00:41:16] curious on, you know, we've talked a lot about, you know, what you do for clients, but when you
[00:41:22] work with other REALTORS, you know, how are you trying to keep those relationships strong as well?
[00:41:28] That's a super good point because that does, that will make a break you getting an offer accepted,
[00:41:35] or you accepting someone else's offer when you're the listing agent, like, hey, I know that,
[00:41:39] I know that buyers agent always places an offer, gets an under contract, and then their buyers
[00:41:44] always back out, you know, like that's like in the beginning of the episode. It's everything.
[00:41:49] Relationships are everything. And so I tell the clients too, I tell the list, you know, my
[00:41:54] sellers, I tell my buyers is the relationships between REALTORS or everything, I will let you know,
[00:42:01] whether or not I have had a transaction with them in the past, whether it went smooth or not,
[00:42:06] because there are some people on my red list that I will not work with again. And I will tell,
[00:42:13] of course, at the end of the day, if the buyers really want the property, of course, but I will tell
[00:42:17] them what happened previously, because it can happen again. So that's my fiduciary duty to my client
[00:42:23] is to let them know what could go wrong. So, and then of course, the list of people to work with is
[00:42:29] always bigger, which is nice. But yeah, of course, if I know if someone that's a black and white,
[00:42:35] or you know, side by side offer, which is the same thing. And I know I have worked with an agent
[00:42:40] in the past and they're professional. They get the job done. They, you know, they work with
[00:42:44] their clients, they're communicative. And then the other one I've never worked with or I've heard
[00:42:48] poor things about, I'll tell my sellers at exactly like, hey, this is what I know. This is what I hear.
[00:42:55] You make the decision. If you want to go with the, with the agent that we've never worked with before,
[00:42:59] cool. It's completely your choice. It's not my house.
[00:43:02] This episode of Keeping It Real is brought to you by Modwell. We've all been there. You can see
[00:43:08] the potential of an outdated property, but your buyer can't. And the opportunity is lost. You
[00:43:13] wish you could snap your fingers and transform the space. And now you can with Modwell. Now listen
[00:43:19] up, this visionary team with years of experience in real estate, architecture, design, and prop tech
[00:43:25] built Modwell's 3D enhanced listing technology to digitally reimagine a property so you can show your
[00:43:31] buyer the stunning possibilities in real time and inspire action. Modwell visually transforms
[00:43:37] high-end homes as well as new developments to move prospects quickly. Josh, on million-dollar
[00:43:43] listing, used Modwell's 3D listing tech to reimagine an outdated 1930s home and went from zero
[00:43:50] showings to 23 book showings and two offers in just 10 days. That's impressive, right?
[00:43:56] Now you might be thinking, I already get renderings done. Well, this is nothing like that. This is
[00:44:01] next level interactive 3D like you've never seen and you must see it to get the full picture.
[00:44:07] I couldn't wait to try it myself and really honestly the demo blew me away. I want you guys to
[00:44:12] experience Modwell and transform your properties. So I asked them to do something special just for our
[00:44:17] listeners and they came through with a $250 credit on your first enhanced 3D listing.
[00:44:25] Just use our special link, livemodwell.com forward slash real. Again, that's livemodwell.com forward
[00:44:32] slash real. Choose them for your very next listing. Help your clients see the future. And now on to our
[00:44:40] show. Yeah, and I think it's also important for everyone listening to remember that there's always
[00:44:46] a wrinkle in every single transaction. There's always going to be something that comes up at some
[00:44:51] point that is going to completely freak the client out. It's just what's going to happen. It's just
[00:44:56] the way it works. And so understanding that you're going to have to solve for that anyway,
[00:45:02] you know, at some point is really important because it's going to happen, but try to minimize the
[00:45:07] wrinkles is really the job of the REALTOR or one of the jobs of the agent. And so this idea of
[00:45:13] knowing, hey, this person, you know, I here's what I know about them. I think is really,
[00:45:18] really important because you want to minimize, you know, whatever the unknown challenges that may
[00:45:22] be coming up. 100%. I am so impressed with this because we're really talking about this process.
[00:45:32] And as we're talking, I'm almost I want to talk to you offline because I want I'm curious if
[00:45:38] one of the things with our show. So I'm sort of speaking to the audience right now. I apologize
[00:45:43] for taking a moment of Ali's time away from her, but I want to think I want you guys who are
[00:45:48] listening and who are fans. One of the things about being a podcaster is it's really a one to zero
[00:45:53] relationship because we don't oftentimes get feedback. Like we know because of people download and
[00:45:58] we know those kind of numbers, but we don't get a lot of like, here's what I'd like to hear more
[00:46:02] over less of. And I realized as Ali was talking, one of the things we haven't I haven't done a good
[00:46:06] job of on this show because I'm not a practice in REALTOR. So I just always go ahead. I don't
[00:46:11] I don't really know a lot about process, but we haven't really ever had a dedicated series around
[00:46:16] process and like specifically like step by step. So I am curious to speaking to our listeners,
[00:46:23] if you would like a regular series on process, like literally, how do I win a listing presentation?
[00:46:30] How do I work with buyers? You know, how do I win offers? All of the how-tos like specific
[00:46:36] step by step. Well, we have somebody on the show right now who maybe would be willing to come back
[00:46:40] and do that on a more regular basis. I have to pitch it to her. She's probably too busy to do it.
[00:46:45] But if you're looking for that kind of stuff that like what we're talking about right now, tell us
[00:46:50] because we will we we work for you guys. We work for the audience. So please tell us what you want
[00:46:56] because this to me is blowing my mind and I don't do enough of conversations like this. So Ali,
[00:47:01] back to you. I apologize, but you are you are doing so such important work for for our audience right
[00:47:06] now. If this is resonating with you guys, please let us know so we can do more of this and maybe we
[00:47:11] can have Ali back on on a more regular basis. And she can go through all 180 steps. So one of her
[00:47:16] checklists and 200 steps and our other. And honestly, guys, imagine if you had that your life would
[00:47:21] be so much easier. Let's make your lives easy. It's hard enough to okay. I'm going to talk about
[00:47:25] sellers because this is a sellers market. We know that. How are you finding sellers? And how
[00:47:31] are you? What are some of the ways in which you're you're finding opportunities with sellers? Everybody
[00:47:36] wants more sellers right now. Yes, they they do, right? Unless they realize that they make more money
[00:47:44] with Microsoft. Yeah. So first actually just because it popped into my head, the other two other ways
[00:47:51] to get your offer is except that back to buyers super cool. Yeah. One, becoming some add something
[00:47:57] personal and something funny, something slightly outlandish in the contract. If they like tickets,
[00:48:02] if they are, I don't know, bear fans by the tickets by them tickets to like a concert. Maybe not
[00:48:09] tellers with, but you know, a concert or something will have them be like, even if the offer prices
[00:48:14] lower, they'll be like, oh my gosh, wait, they thought of me. They they realized that I like the
[00:48:20] Yankees. So now they got me Yankees tickets like, wow. So that's number one. Another another one is
[00:48:26] a more aggressive one where you will offer 10k above if they accept it today. And if they don't
[00:48:33] accept it by today, it'll go down to this number. So how often does that work by the way? Have you
[00:48:39] liked you have a percentage, rough a percentage of how often you've tried that and how often it's
[00:48:43] actually, you know, close the deal? It it works more if you don't offer that on the first day of
[00:48:51] the listing. So because of course they they don't want to tie themselves down when it's day one.
[00:48:57] But week three, if you offer that, you can get a good deal like, hey, this is how much I'm going
[00:49:02] to offer. But if you don't accept and you, you know, starting tomorrow, it goes down to this number.
[00:49:07] Have both numbers work for the buyer, of course, but it's a great way to get a foot in.
[00:49:12] Wow. I've never heard anybody mention that. That is such a simple and a simple idea that I love
[00:49:17] that. I love that. It's almost like you can buy any of those. Oh, yeah. If you combine them,
[00:49:24] all of a sudden now what you have is a very unique offer. Like at the very least, it's unique.
[00:49:30] It's no one else is doing that. And you now have this, you know, possibility of somebody,
[00:49:34] and it's funny. You have a cute little thing in there or you have a gift or or some something
[00:49:39] of value to them. And you're just want to be unique. And I love all of this. Okay, let's let's
[00:49:45] yeah, let's get to sellers. So what's what are it's tough right now. Let's be honest to everyone.
[00:49:51] So I saw statistic recently and I'm probably off on this, but it's close enough. It's something like
[00:49:56] I think it was 85% of home US homeowners currently have a mortgage under 4%. So it's something,
[00:50:02] something like that right around that number. So there's a huge disincentive, whatever the
[00:50:08] disincentivization, whatever there's a huge disincentive to move. I don't know the word, but to move
[00:50:14] right now, right? So I have a 3% mortgage like I'm not moving. I'm not going to a 7% mortgage.
[00:50:18] Unless I have to, unless I have to move, unless there's a really compelling reason, unless my
[00:50:23] poem is appreciated so much where it's like makes sense to cash in on that. But that's a huge problem
[00:50:29] right now. So so how are you still finding these seller opportunities? I feel like my answer won't
[00:50:36] appeal to the masses, but again, it's my military community. So they they move around.
[00:50:43] Yeah, they move. And you know, if they have the investor landlord mindset that they're not going
[00:50:48] to sell, it's great. But a lot of times they they do want to sell. But to try to appeal to more people
[00:50:55] that are not the mill, or if you're not in the military, maybe take that like military relocation,
[00:51:00] I don't know, some that's certain. Not not for the three letters at the end of your name because
[00:51:04] nobody cares about that. I promise. Well, just to get more of the inside scoop of like, hey,
[00:51:09] what is life in the military like? You know, do oh, they have 10 days to find a house as soon as
[00:51:14] they move. That's short, you know, and knowing just the acronyms, you'll be able to get better,
[00:51:19] better suited and therefore talk to be in the military community. For those that are not,
[00:51:26] maybe it's like you're not near military base or post. Then at that point, I would suggest, I guess
[00:51:34] cold calling, you know, like, and it hurts for me to say that because I don't like cold calling.
[00:51:39] I don't even add to the phone, you know. But you can get a great success from that. Cold calling,
[00:51:46] you know, even if you want to go off market direct a seller, I would probably shy away from post
[00:51:51] cars only because it's so money heavy where if you do not continue a lot, a lot, which a lot of
[00:51:57] agents don't, majority do not, then you're going to think post cards don't work. So that's, you
[00:52:02] know, direct mail can anything, any strategy that you choose, if you stick with it long and
[00:52:08] enough, it will work. You just have to choose a couple and stick with it. I was just thinking,
[00:52:14] yes, and I could not agree with you more. Here's a great phone call and I think it's a great
[00:52:18] phone call. Ali will tell me if it is or isn't. So I'm a homeowner. I bought a new development
[00:52:22] a couple years ago in a new condo and a new development. And I have a thing on Zillow because I
[00:52:27] should have it on the MLS, but I do it on Zillow because it's easier and it sends me a report like
[00:52:31] once a month and look, whatever we think about Zestimate fine, but it's what our clients look at.
[00:52:36] So let's like at least acknowledge that we should know what a Zestimate is and whether how accurate
[00:52:42] or inaccurate it is. That's what people are using as a metric. So every month, I get a little
[00:52:46] thing that says, hey, we think your home appreciated or depreciated by X. Now here's a great phone
[00:52:52] call because I set that up for myself. I got a thing yes a week ago that said, your home
[00:52:58] appreciated an insane number like 150 grand in the last 30 days, which by the way, which sounds
[00:53:04] amazing, but that's not really like the reality of the situation. But whatever it is, I noticed it.
[00:53:09] I was like, well, I'm still not moving, but like here would be a great phone call. Hey,
[00:53:13] hey, DJ, you don't know me. I'm a REALTOR. I was looking at your building. I don't know if you
[00:53:19] know this, but in the last 30 days, like I've seen your your I think the value of your property
[00:53:23] is appreciated in insane amount. If you want me just to ever shoot you over a little projection
[00:53:28] of what I think is happening, like I'd be happy to do that if it because most of us are not who
[00:53:33] are out of the business who are not in real estate are not really watching our home value pricing.
[00:53:38] But I would like to know that my home appreciated X amount and not one REALTOR has ever. And maybe
[00:53:44] it's because I'm in the business. I don't think everybody knows some of the business. I don't think
[00:53:47] anyone probably really knows them in the business. But I have never gotten that phone call. I have never
[00:53:52] gotten that email. I've never gotten a text from any REALTOR going like, hey, I want to run
[00:53:56] an updated comp because I think your homes worth a lot more than when you bought it. And I just want
[00:54:00] you to know what it's what it's appreciated to curious to you to get your thoughts. Is that
[00:54:04] is that a good strategy bad strategy? What do you think? I think that's a great strategy because
[00:54:09] one, they realize that they took out time to personalize it. That's for you. That's not your neighbor.
[00:54:14] That's not somebody down the block. That's that's for you. So, um, and I hear people doing that all
[00:54:20] the time, like, or they will even take a screenshot or print out the zillo the zestimate and say,
[00:54:24] this is what zillo thinks. What do you think? I have my own opinion as well. Call me.
[00:54:30] And so something like that could work. Could work too. Well, we're going to have we're going to wrap
[00:54:35] up right now on not because I want to. I would talk to Ali all afternoon, but we are going to get
[00:54:40] her back because we're going to talk process. I mean, I have to sort of convince her that she can
[00:54:45] come back. But if she if she wants to come back, we want her because I want to bring this this
[00:54:50] information to you guys, our audience. Ali, you are amazing. And by the way, you can learn this

My conversation with the great Allie Garcette. Okay, today on the show, we have Allie Garcette from Allie, the agent brokerage with the XP. Now, let me tell you more about Allie. Now Allie Garcette, who is known as Allie, the agent on all social media platforms, developed checklist systems and processes to be able to close 55 transactions in her first two years as an agent. Super amazing. All while being a solo agent and in her first year, and she still had a full-time job at the time. Amazing. She had more leads in time. So she grew her REALTOR downline, her team. She developed this, listen to this everybody. This is so cool. She developed 180 step onboarding checklist that her agents all over the country use and also has a 200 step checklist on working with buyers and sellers from start to finish. So agents can treat this as an actual business. And she gives these checklists and systems and processes to all of the REALTORS that partner with her. She's a fanatic of tracking her numbers. And so she has two excel sheets that she tracks. One is her hourly pay broken down by category. How much she makes per hour working with each seller by her referral, which is really smart. And the other tracker tracks how many conversations she has every day, week and month that lead to appointments and closings. She is more than happy to share these trackers with anyone in our audience that asks for it. So guess what, you're going to ask for it. I want you all to grab your phone unless you're driving. Don't do it then. But grab your phone. Go to whatever social platform Instagram. I know she is big on. And just do a search for Ali, the agent, Al. So Al, the agent, you'll find her. She's super easy to find and partner or message her and she will get you that those checklists and you can even learn a lot more from by the way, she is also a veteran of the armed forces. So we want to honor her for her service. She's too humble to say that, but that's what she has done for our country. And we think her for that Ali. Welcome to oh, and by the way, also follow her on her website, which is Garcede Realty.com J G A R C E D Realty.com. She has tons of resources for agents on there as well. So follow her on social media Ali, the agent and then follow her on her website. Garcede Realty. Ali, welcome to the show. D day, that's the best intro I've ever received. I really appreciate that. Can we say that this is this is such a fun episode for me because Ali sent a message in to our podcast not that long ago in the last couple of months. And she was mentioned and we always love when when people tell us that our show helped them grow their business and it appears that our show has helped you. And I am so, so honored to have a listener now on as a guest. We've done that just a few times in the about 500 episodes. So this is a big, big win for me. I am so happy that you're here. And also you just seem like a really fun person and you do a lot. I'm really a big fan of yours now. So I'm glad you reached out to us so that we can now have this conversation. And it was an instant. Yes, I was like, we got to have her on because this is amazing. But let's, let's start at the very beginning of the journey because you haven't been doing this all that long and yet you have a masked a huge team. You've done a ton of transactions and you are now teaching agents how to duplicate the success that you've had. So well, but let's start at the very beginning before you knew how to do any of this. So how did you get into real estate? Was it immediately after leaving military or you know, tell me about sort of how that worked? Yeah. So I actually got into real estate first through investing and I purchased my first, you know, condo because I was active duty Air Force for a decade. I recently separated. So I started investing. I realized that I liked it and not all the agents were, you know, you're not all three to equal. Yeah, yeah, we'll say that way. Some agents were great. Some agents are I was like, hey, did you ever even go on the property? Anyway, it doesn't matter. So as I knew they wanted to separate from military. I was I was unhappy. You know, I was looking at the people who I would be replacing the journal, Lieutenant Colonel's and I didn't want to be where they were. That's not the life that I wanted to live. So I was thinking, you know, how I knowing that I want to separate from the military, knowing that I want to run away from something, why am I going to run toward? You know, what what should I do? Should I I want to start my own business? Because I don't want to work for somebody else. I'm kind of done with W2s. I'm kind of done with deploying. I've been out of the country three years. I don't want to be out of the country another three in order just to get the military retirement pay not worth it for me. So I was thinking of all sorts of things. My wife in the background was like, Hey, how about you become a REALTOR? How about you become a REALTOR? REALTOR, REALTOR. And I was like, no, I don't like kitchens. I don't like cutesy stuff. I don't wear heels. I certainly don't dress up. Like this is no. I think I'll pass on that. It's all it's selling sunset, right? Like the TV says, sure. But the the more that I started listening to podcasts, that's exactly what I did first. Hey, before I become a licensed REALTOR, let me see what the struggles are of agents. Let me see what the process is like. Let me see. Let me just see. So what do you know? Podcasts are free. I stumbled across yours. And I've been listening to yours every single day. I am not kidding. So that is so, that is that is flattery will get you everywhere, Ali. So thank you. I you are now my absolute favorite guest I've ever had on the show. But I say that to every guest. So, but, but no, but thank you. And I think we are not the only show out there. I'm glad you found ours. There are some other really excellent ones. Real estate rock stars is very good. Massive agent is very good. So shout out to those other podcasts that are helping people as well. I am just one of one of many. But I am I'm glad that that and talk about because there are there are lots of great shows out there. How did that help prepare you? Was it just sort of understanding this is the path and this is what it takes to sort of succeed? Yeah. So, knowing that the that the barrier was low, right? The barrier to entry to be a REALTOR and anybody can do it as long as you're not a villain and you pass the test. Great. You know, that that's the pool is very large. So, as I was listening to podcasts that interview top agents that know how to run a business. That's when I realized that's when the light turned on for me as far as it being an actual business. It's not showing homes and talking about how cute a house is which is like not my thing. You know, it's like the you know. So, as I realize that there are funnels and there's a way to scale it and there's a way to automate stuff. So, that way you're not answering the same questions over and over again. You can you provide the same level of service. Actually, I think better if you compile all the frequently asked questions and make a video series for buyers, for sellers, for referrals, for agents, for everything, that will buy you back so much of your time. So, that's when I realized, hey, there's a process to this and I that's how I want to run my business and that's when I realized it's not just oh showing doors which all quiet think it is. So, that's when I got my license and I got my license in 2021. I was still active duty air force because again, I'm very risk averse. I didn't want to I didn't want to separate from the military and then at that point after that, after I'm without a job, realize that I don't even like being a REALTOR. So, I gave myself one year as because I had one year left in my active duty air force commitment before I separated as major and I gave myself one year, can I make as much as I'm making right now in the military? And at the time, it was $107,000. I was like, I just want to which by the way, that is a tough tough barrier to clear in your first year as an agent. Like that is that is a great salary in general, right? Like $107,000. It's probably not enough for people that want to earn more of course, but for you know, all intensive purposes, that's a really good salary and not an easy one to just go out and get. And so to give yourself a year is really putting the pressure on you to sort of make it happen. Yeah, yeah. So I told everyone I knew, hey, I'm getting my license. I'm not licensed yet, but I'm getting my license. And I have experience, right? Like I had, I've been purchasing properties. So people knew, start already started making that connection. Alley, the agent, which I was a federal agent for the air force. So that was my handle and the military thought I was like me being a special agent. And of course, I'm like, no, I'm a real estate agent now. So as I started telling everyone that I knew and I matched that salary of $107,000 by month eight of me being a REALTOR solo, part time. I was still traveling in the military and everything too. I was like, it was completely unsustainable. I am very much so aware. Like I could not do both at the at the same time forever. So knowing that I matched that at month eight. And then of course, I continued making more because of the, that's how sales work. At that point, I realized one, I matched the income, which is what I wanted to do. I made it less time. And I didn't have the stress of millets being in the military, which I was not the biggest fan of. And I liked it. So then I double down, I separated from the air force. And now I have since then, like grown the, I don't so downline, I guess, like I've grown the downline to 30 agents and we're growing at like three agents a month. And I have all of the checklist because as I was doing it, I didn't want somebody else to ask me the question of, hey, what's the step again? And me not know how am I going to be a resource to them if I don't know. So I'm like, hey, I'm going to as I go through every single hurdle, I'm going to add it to the checklist and I do everything on Trello. It's free. So I add it to the Trello checklist and I give them all access. And it's, it takes some step by step. And by the way, I should a little shout out to Trello. I since the beginning of my podcast, I have only used Trello to manage all of my guests information and in our workflow. And there are other systems out there. But if you're looking for a visual system to basically manage projects or to do's, there aren't a lot of them out there. And it's basically a cool way for those of us who are a little bit more visually minded to be able to to see. I used to work at a software company and we all the developers, there was this big whiteboard with all these stickies. And if you've ever watched a movie where it's, you know, Device offer developers usually can see this thing where there's stickies and they move them around. And it just from a visual perspective, it was better for me to be able to see everything. So shout out to Trello. Allie uses it, countless of her other agents are sorry of our guests have used it and our agents here at R4. And I will say to your point about accumulating sort of like frequently asked questions from from your clients that even if you're a solo agent and you don't have a team, you need to put this together for yourself because it will allow you to copy and paste responses that are to frequently asked questions when you get those texts and emails from your client. You know, we have we have almost 800 agents here at R4M and one of the smartest things we did for our own to be able to support our own agents is obviously, you know, if we got 800 phone calls a day, we wouldn't be able to do much support for our brokers are sorry, they'll allow everyone's a broker so I'll say REALTOR for our REALTOR's. So we created a frequent, basically a knowledge base, a wiki that our agents can use. And so having that even for just yourself is so important so that you like Allie was saying, you know, she asked wants to scale her business and she can't be doing as many one to one interactions if she can automate some of that stuff. So cheers to you for that. That is that is really, really amazing. I want to dive into some of these checklists too because I have I have had a lot of people on the show over the years with checklists but nobody's talked about it in a long time and if I were a practicing agent, I would be using checklists. No question about it. Also, I just want to say as a quick aside, just as a personal thing, we were just talking before we started the show Allie and I and she I won't mention where she's from just in case, you know, there's a privacy thing but she and I have actually been to her Air Force base. And so the funny part is I said, I was actually at a base near where you are and you know, I've been I talked about it. So I have literally been to where she worked and I mean, what are the odds of that? So anyway, just kind of a funny thing 20 years ago, but I was still there. But anyway, okay, let's talk about these checklists because I think there are, you know, it's one of those things that we just assume every agent uses and has but I think most agents don't. So let's talk about sort of what they're there to do and how they work and how you created them. Yeah, so I started creating them with as I was going through each transaction. There is some forward thinking that you can, you know, try to predict, you know, what could happen but every transaction goes so different every single time. So it's frequently asked questions was my number one. As soon as I as soon as any client buyer seller referral anybody asked me a question, I would drop that same question like copy and paste it into the trullo. And then at that point, if I got questions that same question over and over again, I would make a video out of that because it's one thing to respond back copy and paste a text. But it's another thing for them to see you explaining it to you. Even if you're not saying, not personalizing and saying, hey Cindy, you asked this question, this is the answer. They even if they realize this same video goes to all of the buyers, goes to all of the sellers, they realize, oh, this is a whole business for her and she treats us as such, you know, this, there's a difference when you're just scrambling and answering a phone call, which by the way, I do not answer any phone call. I'm on track to triple my military income on my second year, first year as a full time agent, tripling my income and I don't answer phone calls. I love it. Yeah, unless like it's it's already a client who are under contract and there's some something, you know, then at that point, I will, but every every other call is spam, you know, and it's it's just a waste of my time. I don't even want to tally up how many hours or minutes I spend over a course of a week back when I did answer phone calls answering these phone calls that were just robo, you know, calls. So I don't answer calls. Actually, a quick checklist on that is I have an iPhone, but I'm sure you could do this on on the any other phone that you have. Whenever you get a phone coming in, a phone call coming in, you can either respond with those auto responses that the iPhone has. It says, I'm in a meeting, I'll call you back shortly. I rephrased it and I say, hey, I'm currently with the client at the moment, I'm giving them my full attention. Can I help you with anything via text and you brilliant. Yeah, usually it's a question that it can be resolved via text and or sometimes, which is a lot of the times I know REALTORS, I know you hear you hear me on this where a lot of times it's a question that the client just all of a sudden, you know, wanted answer right away when they have access to the answer, you know, give them a little bit of time for them to do their own research. They will find their own answer. I'm not saying that they're going to run their whole transaction, but a lot of times it's, hey, what school district is this in? That's on Google, you know, like that, can I help you via text that adds that extra hurdle? And again, not saying it's like losing any client customer service, but it's, in fact, I really think it's the opposite where, hey, I can't just ask my REALTOR any question at that point. I'm asking them to bend over backward and I don't even, I lose respect to that REALTOR because clearly they have no time since they're answering all of my questions. So it's, it's treating everything as a checklist anyway, going back to the original question of checklist. And so for buyers, sellers, as I had each transaction, I would go through the process, what do I do before I even meet with them? What do I do once I meet with them? What do I do to get them under contract? What do I do once we're under contract? What are some common, you know, occurrences that happen? What are the timelines that I know crap need to know? And how do I follow up with them after, because after the transactions over to make sure they become a repeat customer client? So I, after I had those at first, it was just written on Trello, I then turned those into a video. So I have a buyer video packet. I put all the videos on one pdf, they all go back to my YouTube. And that way it's like a, it's a series. And then same thing for sellers and same thing for agents now for onboarding. I mean, we have a 180 step onboarding Trello checklist for all REALTOR's. I love it. I love it. And we should also talk about sort of the ancillary benefit of putting this information together, which is after practicing herself exclusively, she was like, you know, this, and I'm not telling your story, but, but I'm just making up the story in my head. But something to the effective, oh, by the way, this could be useful to other agents who haven't yet put these materials together. And Ali by now has so many agents asking her, hey, teach me how you do that because number one, she did 55 transactions in her first two years, which is insane. We all know, this while working a full time job, we should mention. And being traveling for the Air Force, that doing all of the responsibilities there, defending our country, and oh, by the way, doing all this, all this transactions. And she, she systematized everything. And now all these agents have reached out to her because they see what she's doing on social media. And they see the the sort of processes and systems she's built. And now they're asking her for that information. And she can now focus a lot of her time on coaching and teaching and still produce by referring a business all over the country and referrals coming both ways. So I think that in and of itself is such a cool thing because it gives you this other way you can also grow as a REALTOR. And more, we'll call it a modern REALTOR, you know, being mostly on the referral side simply by providing value to agents all over the country. So it's like it opened up this whole another business for you, which is so, so cool. Yeah. And as you stated before, I tracked my numbers. I didn't, because I want to know how much I make per hour, right? I want to compare it. Yeah, back in my, back in the days of like me being stressed out over leaving the Air Force, should I leave it? No, I was miserable. How am I, I just wanted again to compare it to what I was making before? I didn't want to lose money. So I created a spreadsheet and it's just Excel. It's nothing crazy. Anybody could do it, but I just have it looking pretty. So if you want to message me, but I created a spreadsheet where every single client that I ever had, I categorized how many hours am I driving around? How many hours am I negotiating with the cross sale or across agent? How many hours am I doing, you know, under negotiations, sitting there in inspections, whatever it is? So tally every single hour that you spend per client for all the sellers, add them all up, you know, divide by the commission. Yeah, what is it by the way? What is it? What is it? What is it average out to for a seller in a buyer? I'd love to know that number. Those numbers. Yeah. So every business is different. My business is very surprisingly, because I thought, you know, listings are everything. Listing is life. Listings was my lowest at $162 per hour. Wow. That was my, why is that, do you think? Because I was sitting at the open houses. There were some REALTORS that wanted me and not anybody else. They wanted me to be at the open house. And of course, that's a conversation that I can, that I sense that have told them, I don't, I don't do that. Plus, it doesn't even help sell your house. It's for REALTORS to get more to get leads. It's not good. You know what? By the way, by the way, what an honest and amazing thing to tell somebody, because they are going to think, well, this my friends, REALTORS, setting all these open houses for me. And what's Ali doing for me? And all you do have to say is, by the way, there's a little sort of secret in the industry that you, you can easily Google and find out that I'm telling the truth here is, it doesn't actually sell your house. It's great for me to get leads, though. So, yeah, so perfect thing. And I think, you know, be, be being able to tell a seller or a buyer, you know, any of the sort of trade secrets, which aren't even really secrets, I think is so important to building trust and, and intimacy with your clients, because now all of a sudden they're like, Ali's telling me something, no other REALTORS told me. Yeah. And that, that really, it comes with knowing, presenting yourself as the person that you are no matter where you're at. So, the clients that you get will be are already attracted to you. They know you as a person. You don't have to pretend to be somebody else. So, yeah, at the lowest, I was making a, I make $162 per seller, $360 per referral. And $453 per hour working with a buyer. Wow. The complete impossible. I, I, it's, I know it's because I have, because of your checklist, because of the check. I've perfected that checklist. Yeah. So it's, I have it down to a tee. Like they don't even need to answer any questions. The common, the common response that I get from buyers is, Ali, you answered my questions before I even knew I had them. Perfect. Exactly. Can you add that in my Google? Can you give me a five-star review of my Google and say exactly that? Yes. Yes. And by the way, my boss, when I bought my first condo, now he's my boss, but, but we were just friends. And he was my REALTOR because, you know, that's how it works. And I, once I started working here, I had said to him, I'm like, you were a really good REALTOR. It was my first experience. This is like 2005. And I said, well, I couldn't quite put my finger on why he was so good. And I said, and I said, what was your philosophy back then? You know, and he goes, I never wanted somebody to have to call me first. I wanted to give them the information before they even knew there was a question. And that way they wouldn't bother me. They wouldn't call me. And also, I would seem like a professional. So yeah. No, 100%. And now the, the REALTOR's that are like using these checklists that I have for the buyers, for sellers, for referrals for everything is on there. There's one agent that joined the crew less than a year ago. She joined from, she switched brokerages. And at the previous brokerage, what she made that entire, in an entire year, she made that in two months because she was able to scale. Like, it's, it's not, it's not rocket science. You know, it's, hey, what are these questions that I'm always getting? What question bothers me? Think about that. Like, what is the one question that I hate answering? You have to make a video out of it. So, and then make that video, link it to some resources that again, you could descend to buyers and sellers. Gosh, I absolutely love all of that. This idea of systematizing and, and having processes. But I am still fascinated that buyers were actually the most profitable for you. Why is that? What, do you think it's because the checklist was so, and we're talking about the pre, pre checklist, working with a buyer, making sure you know, everything they possibly could ever look for and want and need, their musts, their sheds, their whatever. And, and then going, okay, I know so much about what you want. I'm not going to be showing you 25 properties. We can probably narrow it down to three or four or was, I'm assuming that's kind of how that worked or am I wrong? That's exactly it. Yeah. So, major, being that I was military, I, all of my clients, I've only ever done V.A. loans. I've the rest were only V.A. I've like never done conventional. So, the, all the clients that I was getting was from my military sphere. They were all out of state because they're military is PCSing them, removing them. And they're all out of state buyers. I'm the one driving on my own time. I'm not meeting with somebody there. So, I had to schedule, I had to make a process out of that, right? I have to take a video of the outside of the inside of the neighborhood as I'm driving in, driving out, uploaded all to a Google Drive, given the link. They have access to Paws. We wind, zoom in, zoom out. And that is way better than a FaceTime or scheduling a Zoom call between spouses and me. No, that's, that's, that doesn't work. So, I save time that way. And you ever, by the way, I wrote quick. Did you ever use the same video for multiple clients? Because you could make that video once. And if the place is still on the market, you could possibly use it for, again, assuming that people are looking for the same kind of property. I guess you could do that. Right. I could, I never actually had that. That never came up. That would have been nice. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So, and, and it's being very upfront with them. And I feel like I can be with my military clients. And now people that reach out to me, they already know my personality. They know how I don't have to, there's no front. I curse. I don't dress up. I will show up in flip flops, you know, like, or gym attire. And that's, and I will get you your house. So, I, the biggest thing I say is because I was predominantly a buyer's agent back when it was the hardest to be a buyer's agent when I first got started. And I got all of my offers accepted on the first one except for two different clients, which took three attempts. It was, and that's because I go above and beyond. And I tell the clients before that I'm like, hey, I will do whatever it takes to get, to make sure that you get your offer accepted. So, eat your friends that are placing 12, 13 offers to get a property accepted. That's not going to be the case with you. And I can say that confidently because, again, that barrier to becoming a REALTOR is very low. That is the one time I make outbound calls. I just so answer inbound. So, I call the listing agent. I'm like, hey, what can we do to get our offer accepted? My buyer is your perfect question. Not, not, not, yeah, you're basically saying, hey, whatever, whatever you're seeing out there, what can we do because we want this home? So, what can we do to make this work perfect question? Because it really, there's a presupposition there that they're going to help you make it. And if you don't think they can't, if they won't, they won't. But you're basically saying, hey, I want this, what, what does it take? And it forces the person to answer that question in their head. And then hopefully they'll share that with you and give you the secret little tip that you need to take it over the top. Absolutely. And then, and then I tell the clients, before even call the listing agent, I tell the clients a couple of things. One is, as we go over your specific criteria, you will realize that you're not looking at 20 homes. There are only four to five homes that actually meet what you're looking for. So, as you're looking at houses that don't meet all those criteria, make sure that it's a level seven out of 10 before you send it my way, because I don't waste your time or my time. And I'm very honest up front. I'm like, I don't want to waste my time or your time going to these properties. If you don't even really feel like you're going to place an offer. And then I tell them that I'm going to reach out to the listing agent and do whatever it takes to get their offer accepted. So, do not be surprised when your offer is accepted. I don't want you backing out because and I get that makes you look bad. Yeah. Exactly. And I tell them I am a new REALTOR. The last thing I want to do is ruin my reputation by being that agent that backs out. You know, gets gets you offer in and then backs out. And so, I'm I tell every single client that, like I do not ruin my reputation for me. My reputation is the only thing that I have. You know, so and and at that point it it becomes a team thing, right? They're like, oh, wow. Yeah, I don't want to just treat my agent as somebody that can just throw offers here left and there, Spaghetti at the wall. That it become I become more human to them instead of just somebody that will you know, robot that's going to be doing work for them. Plus, I also think too, like as the thinking about it from the buyer's perspective, does a buyer want to go through the emotional ups and downs of losing 12 deals, 12 offers for 12 properties? Like they are going to I can't even imagine how emotionally draining that would be for a buyer. And certainly, you know, I guess, you know, REALTOR whose career is mad at enough could maybe survive their reputation to their buyer, you know, just going, well, this is the way the market is, whatever. I'm sure there's a way to talk through it, but it's certainly not a good experience for a buyer to go through that. And not and also you don't have the time to do that. You don't have time to write 12 offers. And I mean, it's too much. Right. So any other tips, I'm sorry, I have to ask because I'm so fascinated by this, how any other tips to get offers accepted other than, hey, Mr. List or Mrs. Listing agent, what can we do to make this happen? Any other sort of like in the way you present the packages to your to the to the seller to the seller's agent, what are you actually doing? Is there any little tips and tricks that you'd recommend to agents to help get their offers, you know, because there are some agents that just don't answer the phone when other agents are calling in because they got 20 other offers. So are there things that you're laughing because this you deal with this all the time. So when you don't get someone on the phone or when they're not willing to sort of give you any sort of, you know, help, what are you doing in addition to that to get these offers accepted? I love this question, DJ. So first, I talk to buy the buyers about it, right? Like for buyers and for sellers, I have seller email number one through six, buyer email number one through six in the packet that comes out and buyer email number two is all of like my secrets, right? Because buyer email number one is for any buyer. If they don't want to work with me, they won't get buyer email number two. Buying number two is once where you and I are working together in buyer email number two, there's that PDF that has my whole video video series. One of those videos is seven ways to make your to get your offer accepted. Again, it links back to my YouTube. So although I think I have that unlisted because it's just for my clients, but I'm going to share this DJ. So in some states, they do not require non-refundable earnest money. How like how important to the seller and how can you wow a seller by saying wow, no one else is offering non-refundable earnest money. These are more serious because earnest money, good faith money is is it's kind of nothing. It's basically nothing. Yeah. Anything can happen and the buyers will get their money back at least. Of course. Well, that's that's the joke of it all at least here in Illinois, like there's almost no way for anybody to actually keep earnest money. So it's all a big kind of like what are we doing here? Yeah. Yeah. So why not offer something and I'm not talking thousands of dollars. I'm talking 500 bucks and then that also gives the the buyers the buy in. Oh wait, do I really want to miss out on 500 bucks? Do I really like this property enough? That's number one. Number two is yeah. Number two is the escalation clause. Of course, hey, if you have another offer, we will beat it by 500 a thousand, you know, and then of course, talk into the listing agent too is is 500 bucks or is that extra amount of the escalation clause even worth it and have them decide, you know, if they don't want to respond to you, that's that's fine, which I will say actually right now is if you get a listing agent that doesn't respond, then send them a video text. Don't send them a text because how many texts do you get a day? You know, that's just words. That's people just trying to solicit business. No, send them a video text. Hey, what's up DJ? My name is Ali Garza, I'm with the eXp royalty and I don't want to bother you. So I just want to send you this quick video. I have buyers that are very interested in one, two, three main street. What can we do to get their offer accepted? Please give me a call back when you can. Thank you so much. That's it. Like four seconds. And do you do that like on loom or bomb bomb or are you sending a video text or what how do you what's the way that you do that? It was doing it on bomb bomb, but that bomb bomb creates one another layer of friction where they have to click. Yeah, that the click and then it goes to the link. So I just send it, especially if it's iPhone iPhone. So it's so easy. I just send an actual video from my phone to them as a text message. Perfect. Yeah. And what and I know you can't see the open rates on those you'd be able to see bomb bomb. But what do you think the open rates are when you send those video chats to other other agents? It's got to be pretty high. I'm guessing. Yeah. 100. Oh yeah. Because one they see because because everyone else the barrier is so low. Everyone else leaves it at a phone call leaves it at a voicemail. I don't answer voice. I don't even listen to voice mail. If it's that important, you will call me back or you'll text me because even my voice mail says text me. Yeah. So and everyone else just does a text which now all text seems so spammy. Make yourself look like a human. Yeah. And showcase your personality. You don't have to be like the whole bubbly person. But if you're real, if I said if I get a video text message, that shows me that that person is serious. They created a whole video for me, even if it was four seconds. Now I know what they look like. I already like them. You know, I maybe I do want to work with them. Maybe I do want to trust them to get their offer accepted all that. So that's number three, I guess. Number four, I actually have seven different ways in my video. And this has been a while since I've actually worked with with buyers. Because then my second year I work mainly sellers when it was harder to be a seller is a listing agent. But I'm telling you though, just as you're trying to find a few of those other tips that you don't have to have them all in front of you, of course. But I know what the title of this episode is going to be and is going to be believe it or not, it's more profitable to work with buyers. And everybody's this is going to be our most downloaded episode ever because nobody is going to be like, there's no way that's possible. And we are going to show that it is. So I love these tips. I do have a question. I wanted to ask you when it comes to submitting back to submitting offers. What do we think about love letters? And for those of us that don't know what a love letter is, this is when you have your clients write a letter about how much they love the house and what they plan to do with it. And how grateful they be if they offered get accepted, you know, basically a lot of, you know, interpersonal sort of stuff. And there's there's debate on this. There's there's lots of debates on possibly is it even violating fair housing. So there's a whole sort of compliance issue. Some states are okay with it. Others aren't. But it's controversial topic. What do you think about those? As before, I got a license. I loved love letters because I was an investor. Like, hey, I want to talk at the heartstrings and, you know, all of that. But now that I'm a REALTOR, first of all, $25,000 fine. I don't, I'm not going to mess with that. I'm not going to mess with that. So I do, I switch my opinion on that. I do not like love letters. Plus with a love letter, yes, there are some things that you cannot say to not violate any housing rules. But even I don't understand, because even when you sign it, even if you, if you add a photo, they see what you look like, you know, they see what that couple looks like or what that person type of dog anything. And when they sign their names, you could judge based off of their names. So if a judge really is what you're saying. Yeah, it's just too risky. Wait, too risky. Yeah. So I, plus, yeah, you don't need it. I get my offers accepted. You know, that's, that is such a, yeah, right. You don't need it anyway. But it's such a strong point for those of us that are still doing love letters. Let's, let's just think about a scenario here where you don't want to lose your license. You don't want to get in trouble. And certain states are more lenient about it than others. But let's think about this. They see the last name being signed. And let's just say it's Garcia just, just choosing a name at random. They can make an assumption based on that last name and ethnicity, you know, where that person's from, you can, somebody, people can make assumptions about education, finances, and all of a sudden, now we're into this weird fair housing gray area where we haven't technically violated the fair housing because we're not saying, hey, this is so and so Garcia and look at all the cool stuff associated with that name. It's, but people do make those assumptions because we're just human beings who'd like to put people in categories. And all of a sudden now, whatever we think about that last name, Garcia might start flooding into our decision making strategy as a seller or as a seller's agent. And so you just don't want to be part of that at all because maybe even five years later, if your client feels like, oh, I bought a bad property and they talk to an attorney and they're like, oh, look at this. We can make an assumption that, you know, based your REALTOR sort of did the wrong thing, even though it wasn't intentionally done for the wrong reason. So you just made a very, very compelling case to just, let's just play on the on the, on the safe side and not give somebody the opportunity to make a decision that possibly could violate fair housing. Yeah, smart. Yeah. Along with that, too, what typically goes on a love letter, a photo. So now they're judging based off of what you look like with the clothes, the background, you know, like what's what's what's on what's on what's on what's on are you in. So everything and the timing itself, even if even if it was black and white, like I know that this one, you know, would not violate any housing rules. The timing never works out. So I don't know, you know, because as soon as we're placing an offer or my clients want to look at a property, want to want to make an offer and a property, the at that point, then they're going to snail mail, you know, or maybe find an email that they might or might or might not open, then they're going to snail mail. At that point, we're already under contract. That it's just, you know, it's so no, I don't like love letters. Now that makes that makes perfect sense. How important is it to develop relationships with other REALTORS in your market? Because of course, love letters, we talked about potential fair housing violations, but having strong relationships with other REALTORS does possibly help grease the wheels because we like to work with people we like in a lot of cases that may help push you over the edge if you have similar or various, you know, identical offers possibly. So I'm curious on, you know, we've talked a lot about, you know, what you do for clients, but when you work with other REALTORS, you know, how are you trying to keep those relationships strong as well? That's a super good point because that does, that will make a break you getting an offer accepted, or you accepting someone else's offer when you're the listing agent, like, hey, I know that, I know that buyers agent always places an offer, gets an under contract, and then their buyers always back out, you know, like that's like in the beginning of the episode. It's everything. Relationships are everything. And so I tell the clients too, I tell the list, you know, my sellers, I tell my buyers is the relationships between REALTORS or everything, I will let you know, whether or not I have had a transaction with them in the past, whether it went smooth or not, because there are some people on my red list that I will not work with again. And I will tell, of course, at the end of the day, if the buyers really want the property, of course, but I will tell them what happened previously, because it can happen again. So that's my fiduciary duty to my client is to let them know what could go wrong. So, and then of course, the list of people to work with is always bigger, which is nice. But yeah, of course, if I know if someone that's a black and white, or you know, side by side offer, which is the same thing. And I know I have worked with an agent in the past and they're professional. They get the job done. They, you know, they work with their clients, they're communicative. And then the other one I've never worked with or I've heard poor things about, I'll tell my sellers at exactly like, hey, this is what I know. This is what I hear. You make the decision. If you want to go with the, with the agent that we've never worked with before, cool. It's completely your choice. It's not my house. This episode of Keeping It Real is brought to you by Modwell. We've all been there. You can see the potential of an outdated property, but your buyer can't. And the opportunity is lost. You wish you could snap your fingers and transform the space. And now you can with Modwell. Now listen up, this visionary team with years of experience in real estate, architecture, design, and prop tech built Modwell's 3D enhanced listing technology to digitally reimagine a property so you can show your buyer the stunning possibilities in real time and inspire action. Modwell visually transforms high-end homes as well as new developments to move prospects quickly. Josh, on million-dollar listing, used Modwell's 3D listing tech to reimagine an outdated 1930s home and went from zero showings to 23 book showings and two offers in just 10 days. That's impressive, right? Now you might be thinking, I already get renderings done. Well, this is nothing like that. This is next level interactive 3D like you've never seen and you must see it to get the full picture. I couldn't wait to try it myself and really honestly the demo blew me away. I want you guys to experience Modwell and transform your properties. So I asked them to do something special just for our listeners and they came through with a $250 credit on your first enhanced 3D listing. Just use our special link, livemodwell.com forward slash real. Again, that's livemodwell.com forward slash real. Choose them for your very next listing. Help your clients see the future. And now on to our show. Yeah, and I think it's also important for everyone listening to remember that there's always a wrinkle in every single transaction. There's always going to be something that comes up at some point that is going to completely freak the client out. It's just what's going to happen. It's just the way it works. And so understanding that you're going to have to solve for that anyway, you know, at some point is really important because it's going to happen, but try to minimize the wrinkles is really the job of the REALTOR or one of the jobs of the agent. And so this idea of knowing, hey, this person, you know, I here's what I know about them. I think is really, really important because you want to minimize, you know, whatever the unknown challenges that may be coming up. 100%. I am so impressed with this because we're really talking about this process. And as we're talking, I'm almost I want to talk to you offline because I want I'm curious if one of the things with our show. So I'm sort of speaking to the audience right now. I apologize for taking a moment of Ali's time away from her, but I want to think I want you guys who are listening and who are fans. One of the things about being a podcaster is it's really a one to zero relationship because we don't oftentimes get feedback. Like we know because of people download and we know those kind of numbers, but we don't get a lot of like, here's what I'd like to hear more over less of. And I realized as Ali was talking, one of the things we haven't I haven't done a good job of on this show because I'm not a practice in REALTOR. So I just always go ahead. I don't I don't really know a lot about process, but we haven't really ever had a dedicated series around process and like specifically like step by step. So I am curious to speaking to our listeners, if you would like a regular series on process, like literally, how do I win a listing presentation? How do I work with buyers? You know, how do I win offers? All of the how-tos like specific step by step. Well, we have somebody on the show right now who maybe would be willing to come back and do that on a more regular basis. I have to pitch it to her. She's probably too busy to do it. But if you're looking for that kind of stuff that like what we're talking about right now, tell us because we will we we work for you guys. We work for the audience. So please tell us what you want because this to me is blowing my mind and I don't do enough of conversations like this. So Ali, back to you. I apologize, but you are you are doing so such important work for for our audience right now. If this is resonating with you guys, please let us know so we can do more of this and maybe we can have Ali back on on a more regular basis. And she can go through all 180 steps. So one of her checklists and 200 steps and our other. And honestly, guys, imagine if you had that your life would be so much easier. Let's make your lives easy. It's hard enough to okay. I'm going to talk about sellers because this is a sellers market. We know that. How are you finding sellers? And how are you? What are some of the ways in which you're you're finding opportunities with sellers? Everybody wants more sellers right now. Yes, they they do, right? Unless they realize that they make more money with Microsoft. Yeah. So first actually just because it popped into my head, the other two other ways to get your offer is except that back to buyers super cool. Yeah. One, becoming some add something personal and something funny, something slightly outlandish in the contract. If they like tickets, if they are, I don't know, bear fans by the tickets by them tickets to like a concert. Maybe not tellers with, but you know, a concert or something will have them be like, even if the offer prices lower, they'll be like, oh my gosh, wait, they thought of me. They they realized that I like the Yankees. So now they got me Yankees tickets like, wow. So that's number one. Another another one is a more aggressive one where you will offer 10k above if they accept it today. And if they don't accept it by today, it'll go down to this number. So how often does that work by the way? Have you liked you have a percentage, rough a percentage of how often you've tried that and how often it's actually, you know, close the deal? It it works more if you don't offer that on the first day of the listing. So because of course they they don't want to tie themselves down when it's day one. But week three, if you offer that, you can get a good deal like, hey, this is how much I'm going to offer. But if you don't accept and you, you know, starting tomorrow, it goes down to this number. Have both numbers work for the buyer, of course, but it's a great way to get a foot in. Wow. I've never heard anybody mention that. That is such a simple and a simple idea that I love that. I love that. It's almost like you can buy any of those. Oh, yeah. If you combine them, all of a sudden now what you have is a very unique offer. Like at the very least, it's unique. It's no one else is doing that. And you now have this, you know, possibility of somebody, and it's funny. You have a cute little thing in there or you have a gift or or some something of value to them. And you're just want to be unique. And I love all of this. Okay, let's let's yeah, let's get to sellers. So what's what are it's tough right now. Let's be honest to everyone. So I saw statistic recently and I'm probably off on this, but it's close enough. It's something like I think it was 85% of home US homeowners currently have a mortgage under 4%. So it's something, something like that right around that number. So there's a huge disincentive, whatever the disincentivization, whatever there's a huge disincentive to move. I don't know the word, but to move right now, right? So I have a 3% mortgage like I'm not moving. I'm not going to a 7% mortgage. Unless I have to, unless I have to move, unless there's a really compelling reason, unless my poem is appreciated so much where it's like makes sense to cash in on that. But that's a huge problem right now. So so how are you still finding these seller opportunities? I feel like my answer won't appeal to the masses, but again, it's my military community. So they they move around. Yeah, they move. And you know, if they have the investor landlord mindset that they're not going to sell, it's great. But a lot of times they they do want to sell. But to try to appeal to more people that are not the mill, or if you're not in the military, maybe take that like military relocation, I don't know, some that's certain. Not not for the three letters at the end of your name because nobody cares about that. I promise. Well, just to get more of the inside scoop of like, hey, what is life in the military like? You know, do oh, they have 10 days to find a house as soon as they move. That's short, you know, and knowing just the acronyms, you'll be able to get better, better suited and therefore talk to be in the military community. For those that are not, maybe it's like you're not near military base or post. Then at that point, I would suggest, I guess cold calling, you know, like, and it hurts for me to say that because I don't like cold calling. I don't even add to the phone, you know. But you can get a great success from that. Cold calling, you know, even if you want to go off market direct a seller, I would probably shy away from post cars only because it's so money heavy where if you do not continue a lot, a lot, which a lot of agents don't, majority do not, then you're going to think post cards don't work. So that's, you know, direct mail can anything, any strategy that you choose, if you stick with it long and enough, it will work. You just have to choose a couple and stick with it. I was just thinking, yes, and I could not agree with you more. Here's a great phone call and I think it's a great phone call. Ali will tell me if it is or isn't. So I'm a homeowner. I bought a new development a couple years ago in a new condo and a new development. And I have a thing on Zillow because I should have it on the MLS, but I do it on Zillow because it's easier and it sends me a report like once a month and look, whatever we think about Zestimate fine, but it's what our clients look at. So let's like at least acknowledge that we should know what a Zestimate is and whether how accurate or inaccurate it is. That's what people are using as a metric. So every month, I get a little thing that says, hey, we think your home appreciated or depreciated by X. Now here's a great phone call because I set that up for myself. I got a thing yes a week ago that said, your home appreciated an insane number like 150 grand in the last 30 days, which by the way, which sounds amazing, but that's not really like the reality of the situation. But whatever it is, I noticed it. I was like, well, I'm still not moving, but like here would be a great phone call. Hey, hey, DJ, you don't know me. I'm a REALTOR. I was looking at your building. I don't know if you know this, but in the last 30 days, like I've seen your your I think the value of your property is appreciated in insane amount. If you want me just to ever shoot you over a little projection of what I think is happening, like I'd be happy to do that if it because most of us are not who are out of the business who are not in real estate are not really watching our home value pricing. But I would like to know that my home appreciated X amount and not one REALTOR has ever. And maybe it's because I'm in the business. I don't think everybody knows some of the business. I don't think anyone probably really knows them in the business. But I have never gotten that phone call. I have never gotten that email. I've never gotten a text from any REALTOR going like, hey, I want to run an updated comp because I think your homes worth a lot more than when you bought it. And I just want you to know what it's what it's appreciated to curious to you to get your thoughts. Is that is that a good strategy bad strategy? What do you think? I think that's a great strategy because one, they realize that they took out time to personalize it. That's for you. That's not your neighbor. That's not somebody down the block. That's that's for you. So, um, and I hear people doing that all the time, like, or they will even take a screenshot or print out the zillo the zestimate and say, this is what zillo thinks. What do you think? I have my own opinion as well. Call me. And so something like that could work. Could work too. Well, we're going to have we're going to wrap up right now on not because I want to. I would talk to Ali all afternoon, but we are going to get her back because we're going to talk process. I mean, I have to sort of convince her that she can come back.
