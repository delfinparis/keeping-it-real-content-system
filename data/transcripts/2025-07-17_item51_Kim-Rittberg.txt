[00:01:32] Today's episode is brought to you by Corded.io.
[00:01:35] Are you looking for agents to join your brokerage or team?
[00:01:39] Now, as a real estate recruiter, I can tell you the answer is always yes.
[00:01:43] But most agents aren't looking to move right now.
[00:01:46] So how do you know who to contact?
[00:01:48] Well, what if I were to tell you there's a recruiting and retention tool powered by artificial intelligence that shows you exactly which agents in your local market are looking to leave their brokerage right now and which agents at your own firm are also looking to leave you?
[00:02:04] Now, I've been recruiting REALTORS for 15 years and I've hired over 2000 agents.
[00:02:09] I can tell you with no exaggeration. This is the tool I've been waiting for.
[00:02:13] Corded.io looks for trends across dozens of variables for each agent in your market and shows you which agents they believe are likely to move. Not only does it do that.
[00:02:23] But Corded.io went and visited my recruiting website and read everything I offer.
[00:02:28] So now when I'm recruiting, Corded.io tells me exactly what to say based on that agent's needs and what my brokerage can offer.
[00:02:36] It even writes emails for me. I've never seen anything like it and I use it every single day.
[00:02:42] Now, if you are looking to grow your brokerage, Corded.io is the best tool out there.
[00:02:48] Visit Corded.io to schedule a demo again. That's Corded.io and now on to the show.
[00:03:09] Hello, keep your real listeners. I am Kim Rickberg and I feel as listen to this show before.
[00:03:13] I guess to host about once a month and I generally teach agents how to make better video and how to show up confidently on camera.
[00:03:20] And you know, if you've listened to any of my last past episodes or I'll just tell you why.
[00:03:25] But if you learn how to convert your content into cash, that is the key to growing as an agent in the modern era where social media is so important.
[00:03:34] So I recommend you listen to some past episodes if you're really interested in diving deep into a video.
[00:03:39] But today I'm really excited to bring in a special guest. So Sabina Hitchin is here.
[00:03:44] She is known as the PR Fairy Godmother. Why are we talking about PR? People are probably like Kim is a video person. Why is she talking here?
[00:03:50] So real estate agents, of course, are showing up on social media more and more.
[00:03:55] But if you want to get featured in the press, Sabina Hitchin is the person you need to know.
[00:03:59] So I'm bringing her in here and she's going to give you really amazing advice on how real estate agents can get featured in the press a little bit about Sabina.
[00:04:07] She is an educator, an entrepreneur, a speaker and a small business media strategist.
[00:04:12] She's dedicated over 17 years to spotlighting small business owners and entrepreneurs.

[00:04:38] And she's been featured in various media outlets, including Good Morning America Forbes NBC News ABC News entrepreneur USA today, the near post and more.
[00:04:46] And make sure to follow her at Sabina S a B I N A K N O W S Sabina knows across all platforms and she lives in Portland, mean with her husband, daughter and dog George Michael Sabina.
[00:04:56] Thank you for joining us.
[00:04:58] I'm so excited to talk about this because I always get hyped about what you're doing for the real estate community.
[00:05:04] Awesome. And so one thing I want to share is before you know adjacent to me being in video, I was actually a TV journalist.
[00:05:11] I was doing video and journalism. So Sabina as a publicist is someone I would work closely with and respect so much the value of publicity for what it can do for people.
[00:05:20] So Sabina, talk to me first. Why would a real estate agent want to invest their time or their effort or money or whatever into getting press?
[00:05:29] Great question. And just probably listening to might be like, what is that even look like when when can I say this we're talking like you sharing your tips on TV or in a website of calm, the newspaper, etc.
[00:05:39] For free because it's press right so things I like about publicity when you're a real estate agent specifically our number one visibility boosting all of a sudden I'm seeing you and let's be real.
[00:05:51] Like we're in a crowded market so we want to stand out. So number one all of a sudden if I'm sharing my expert advice on a local morning show or sharing advice on like for first time home sellers on like Cosmo or glamour all of a sudden I'm being seen.
[00:06:06] And also depending on the type of press you put out there and we'll talk about that a little bit later it helps you differentiate yourself like why am I choosing you and a lot of that can be very personal decision.
[00:06:17] And so press helps me choose you all of a sudden I'm seeing you on television or I'm reading your story or advice on a local website and I'm like, oh I like this person like I want this Christine selling my house.
[00:06:29] So there's a lot of to do with like the visibility the differentiation and also the authority I'm trusting you more because people are choosing to talk to you so I see you as a resource quick example I live in Portland Maine where like real estate is wild right now right.
[00:06:45] And I have seen real estate agents here appearing in national news talking about real estate trends and things like that and now I'm following them on Instagram and like you know with video and social then the funnel begins right now I'm big fans.
[00:06:59] And I love this so just for people listening to clarify so we're talking about press is being the sort of thing that's giving you credibility that is also when you really think about it's like an outside badge of honor so it is not replacing all your efforts in social media or on video you still need that because you can directly connect with buyers directly connect with sellers and you can also be providing your own expertise.
[00:07:24] But when you're landing in press it gives you that extra badge of honor as seen in you know local TV has written up on you know whatever you know just trying to think like the real deal whatever so you're getting someone else saying oh Christina's legit like up she is legit and so I think that it's just important to pause right there it doesn't replace it so the PR press is like next to what you're doing for yourself on your social media on your video on your blog on your news.
[00:07:54] So okay we're going to move on now but I wanted to pause because I talk a lot about social media and video but the value of press is really important and I just like it was a one quick thing like him is so right and what I love to picture at press for success we say like picture wheel and it's like content community publicity spinning around together and they all or like a three leg of so they all need to show up because I want to see you in all those places just like you're working so hard to become part of your communities in different ways and spending that money that content is really important.
[00:08:24] Content me the video content the social and the publicity all but together make to the real estate agent that stands out or agency love that so now I want to get right into the nitty gritty so you know let's say you have an agent and this person let's we're going to call her Lauren Lauren wants to get press what what are the first things she should do and I know that we're going to jump into the three types of things that she should be pitching what's first thing Lauren should do if she says I want to go and try to get her.
[00:08:54] I want to get press for myself and you're right because it's not like just like Lauren and run towards the media you I like to take a step back and be like what is everything I need to show up like the real estate expert I need to be so they choose me so things and if you know Kim you're probably in the lucky boat already because it's things like number one do I have some place that showcases who I am some kind of website or landing page or even Instagram these days that showcases like me I look trustworthy I look like I can speak on camera like you want that video on that page so I'm like oh Lauren.
[00:09:23] Lauren feels like the right kind of person for our program or even our dot com like she feels legit right if you're aiming towards TV prior to even pitching you want to make sure you have a photo be role of yourself doing different things like you know something that symbolizes video that symbolizes your real estate life like stacking all that stuff up in advance so that when you're ready to show up like the story ideas almost the least important part it's like are all your ducks in a row and the last thing I'm going to say is if you want this to do it you want to do it.
[00:09:53] Maybe something you want to do and I think you should it so powerful and you need to start getting in that ecosystem this is like a talent of real estate people so like I'm going to start following the people who do real estate stories and not just like New York time was also a journal but like people are talking about home buying and selling everywhere from AARP to Oprah daily so I'm starting to like look at where real estate conversations show up or similar conversations about like money and wealth and resources that your demographic cares about.
[00:10:23] So you could be like hmm I can start getting to know these spaces because I belong in them and I feel just really say people understand that because they understand relationships so if I'm like this is it yeah Kim I want to do this.
[00:10:36] You really want to go beyond just like getting yourself ready start watching the places real estate conversations show up looking at the press how they're talking about it so you can start seeing yourself in those places.
[00:10:48] And a couple of things to be said so for those of you who don't know what B-roll is no problem just follow me on Instagram and I'll tell you drop me a line of B-roll.
[00:10:55] I literally interview you about it. Yeah.
[00:10:57] One of the things that was mentioning is basically if you want to be interviewed on TV they're going to want to see they're going to say Lauren is a real estate agent in Portland Maine they're just going to want to see some footage of you looking at floor plans of you at your computer.
[00:11:12] It's like it's not that complicated but it is something that you know you don't have until you're pursuing press or until you're active with your social media.
[00:11:20] It's just something that she was mentioning and then Sabina I do think you mentioned a couple of outlets but talk to me about starting locally like those are really where people have the relationship so talk to me about how an agent Lauren can be starting to build her relationships with her local press to start to get featured locally first.
[00:11:39] Exactly and we'll talk about the specific stories in a sec but I want you to start saying okay I want to serve and I want you to like erase any thought of your head of like I'm being a pastor I'm like being so salesy like you are serving up real estate information to people who need it real estate is a wild hot topic it has been for years now so the people in your hometown are curious what do I need to know you're not trying to sell your agency or self you're being like a resource so what you want to start doing is looking again like we're not going to be able to see what you're doing and what you're doing.
[00:12:08] Where are they talking about real estate related stories in my local hometown newspaper or regional newspaper. Where are they talking about it on local TV and again it doesn't have to be on the nose but you're like okay this is something where they've said like oh like in Portland made real estate is always a hot topic so you see it appearing on certain news shows you start saying okay these are the places I belong every one of you has a local CBS ABC NBC Fox you do you have to watch it in real time start stream.
[00:12:38] I'm assuming and getting to know those places and getting to know the reporters where they're like that's the basic research you start doing because that's where we're eventually going to take the key stories I'm going to talk to you about in a second but you can't be like I want to be on TV in Nashville and not know any TV shows that are national you want to be like oh I got I know talk of the town is in Nashville I know wake up Nashville like you want to know those things because you're going to be serving yourself up to those places as an amazing resource.
[00:13:06] And a reminder to anyone who's still you know a little camera shy you don't have to be aiming for local TV it can be local yes yes or digital so you know we all have our local paper so I live in Brooklyn New York the Brooklyn Eagle Brooklyn paper and then you might say what about the New York Daily News what about the New York Post so it's your local TV there's really when you think about it like look at your table look at your kitchen table what are the magazines newspapers landing doorstep or what are the Instagram handles you follow locally.
[00:13:35] And then you're kind of going to build that list of okay here's three places six places 10 places that I actually read that people I know read and Sabina mentioned something earlier I think is really important that we can we'll talk about next is when you're pitching yourself is like when you read a story and there's an expert quoted you can be that person quoted so it must be like you know I live in New York so it's not necessarily be like Lauren like a feature on Lauren this real estate agent in New York unless you're doing something super interesting.
[00:14:05] And amazing it's kind of hard to get a feature but it might be like wow like you know this.
[00:14:12] Seven new developments what up in Queens here's Lauren.
[00:14:15] And in Queens to comment on that trend so again exactly we're really talking about you getting featured in the press but maybe don't think about who's going to feature me like it is hard to get a story where you're on the front page but it's a different like a lighter lift to get quoted to get exactly.
[00:14:33] And you're still getting those logos and those relationships and also if you're one of those people is like not me on TV baby not yet just like we're talking about those newspapers and dot coms that is a place where I'm also like if you can do it locally like if you can draw a small circle you can draw a big circle so if you're okay to like pitch your local newspaper.
[00:14:51] And you have a great trend to report on it like you like don't sell don't try to buy your first house in this economy until you do this you can also be pitching that to.
[00:15:01] Cosmo dot com glamor dot com like where the people reading who are buying first home homes and you're pursuing them that way so again that's easier it's not TV it becomes very similar to finding homes locally.
[00:15:15] Home through your story sorry awesome and now so we know let's jump into I know you have three type stories that real estate agent should be pitching to get themselves press let's talk about those.
[00:15:25] Yeah you already started with me so we'll go to that so my two favorites for real estate agents that book consistently are again when you show up as a service provider in the sense like I'm going to give you everything you need to know about the real estate space so.
[00:15:40] That is going to land in the form of expert tips right seasonal evergreen expert advice again like don't buy your first home until you this or how to stage your home or if there's a you know so like anything like an expert advice from your industry that people will find.
[00:15:54] So useful if you can make it seasonal even better so you're providing advice the second part is piggybacking on hot topics in the news and that's a power play for real estate people because every day there is something about the real estate market that you can take and say hey they just announced this or this is happening with interest rates let me translate that for the people of Kalamazoo Michigan let me translate that like what is that mean for local Chicagoans or so like you're saying new development coming up what is that mean.
[00:16:29] So again if you can start saying okay what expert advice do I have to give that seasonal or juicy or what is happening in the world of real estate or real estate adjacent that would impact my future or current customers and I'm going to become a resource of that information beginning locally because it's easy like bumpers on a bowling lane like I can start here but that's not going to be a good thing.
[00:16:54] But then I encourage you to start saying to yourself okay if I'm okay talking to my local demo customers like local newspaper about like in this economy don't think about selling your house until you do this or don't think about buying a house until you do this.
[00:17:09] Well why couldn't I say that same thing to Oprah.com where people are talking about this or ABC news.com or CNN.com so just remembering you can do that same thing many places but the expert tips and the piggybacking are where we kick off and if I can just add one little thing to the fire before we go on to another idea but I'm expert tips if you want to get a little bit deeper can also expand like if I'm a real estate agent like Lauren and I want people to choose to do that.
[00:17:39] Yes I want them to see me as an expert yes I want them to see me as an authority piggybacking on things but I want them to choose me in a way that they like I feel like they know me so sometimes for that when I'm working with a real estate agent I will slide in anecdotal wisdom like how I went from a high school teacher to really say agent and like why that pivot changed my life or how I'm working and being a mom with summer camp like something that is just allowing me to make my real estate career the better way to do that.
[00:18:10] I'm giving advice to other working moms or people pursuing a pivot or something like that so then I'm able to share another side of myself so of course I lean into the expert real estate tips first or the piggybacking but I believe once you start that machine going you should consider are there other parts of my life that I'm very good at that are adjacent to real estate maybe it's like how you stay productive during the summer months as a world.
[00:18:39] I'm working with her and or God help me like all those things so those types of expert advice is anecdotal wisdom you have as a person of working and living and whatever existence you are is another layer just to put in your back pocket because when you're a real estate agent you want someone to choose you and sometimes that comes from knowing you a little bit more than just your advice does that make sense.
[00:19:02] Yeah my tips would be like how does they productive during the summer don't try just getting sit and enjoy the weather while you're on those new meetings but I mean but they like think you're funny.
[00:19:13] Right exactly so one thing I was just thinking about so I have a client Kathleen who's an agent in Texas and she had a social media post a video about what does Trump's big beautiful bill mean for you as a buyer.
[00:19:24] Yes and it performed really well so one thing you could be thinking about as you're thinking about your expert tips what are the sort of ideas you're talking you're making for content that's like reactive to the news or seasons and then you can also say what do people ask me a lot about like you know when there's a new bill or when there's a new season or if the interest rate changes you're going to get a lot of the same questions so
[00:19:47] you know so you're recommending use that those are sort of things that are in there that's the kind of idea you should pitch okay so we have actually you see a performance on Instagram I was going to say if it performs well and socially it's likely to perform well statistically and historically in the press like it's people so you're like whoa this tells me people are interested the press are people to totally okay great so what is the second type of story agents should be pitching.
[00:20:09] Okay so expert tips are jumble the second was piggybacking so there's like two separate the third thing I want you to do and we can break those down a little bit more but again like expert tips number one so I'm thinking industry base and I'm thinking at a total when I feel it when I have something that feels purposeful the second type of story you want to be monitoring for is the piggybacking again like piggybacking on hot topics survey studies and if you are serious about press and you're listening to him and me right now I want you to act like you're not going to be a good guy.
[00:20:39] Actually you say to yourself instead of being like this is so interesting be like okay first challenge is like what set of expert tips could I put on my calendar for this month whenever you are receiving and thinking about this like what or maybe looking ahead what is one set of expert tips I could put on my calendar for next month that would be seasonal and timely and juicy because you need to knock over that first domino right and start the the train of stories going and I would be showing up like once a month with a new set of expert tips.
[00:21:09] And then also be pitching out to the back you can totally and then also because I know that if you're a regular here you hear from Kim like you follow Kim on social would you show it like you know that you're so passionate about video because then I'm a producer or report even a newspaper reporter and I'm like oh okay I'm going to go check out Lauren on Instagram to make sure she feels legit and not like it a robot then I'm like whoa she actually was just on her soapbox about the big beautiful bill and what it means to our home mind and now I am going to do it.
[00:21:36] I'm going to see her energy and I'm like yes this is so interesting so again you're multi-purposing that content if you're somebody who does a newsletter you can even send that off to your customer newsletter right your YouTube there's so many ways to do it.
[00:21:52] So again we're doing expert set of tips we're piggybacking and the last one that I love to lean into because I see real estate agents as entrepreneurs of their own kind right there doing the work they're marketing them putting themselves out there they're leading you to the market.
[00:22:06] So I like to find some way to weave in our founder story right like again meet the local mom who built a real estate empire from the shores of Portland Maine or meet the local real estate group that has donated like you know
[00:22:23] $10,000 a charity in the past month or this it like meet the two sisters who started who are like working in real estate together find out their advice and how to work with your sibling and still love each other at the end of the day.
[00:22:36] So you're thinking like what is my story I met someone I think through you Kim Debbie was that it.
[00:22:46] Yes I was like your star like you so interesting and I'm like I want to hear every part of your story I love how you work with your family I love how you're in your head like 10 things like this is fascinating to me and so your local press if it's not set up as a commercial for you but like a story and again real estate is just like the canvas at which you're telling your story of a pivot of a transformation of a choice to work with someone like a partner or a spouse or a kid like.
[00:23:14] All of that is just story telling at the end of the day so if you can start to say like where is the story behind what I do what is the why behind what I do we're used to one who was like selling lemonade as a kid and now you're selling homes where you like.
[00:23:27] I forgot a college totally pivoted out of a science career and accidentally became a real estate agent like tell us those stories provide a little takeaway for the reader or the viewer that and then look around locally first and then beyond and say where are people talking about.
[00:23:43] Pivots or stories or carrying stories of local people and then how can I walk myself into that instead of feeling like a commercial about myself feeling like a story that local people like I never knew that.
[00:23:58] Carol has a puppetry thing like you know what I mean does that make sense Carol love puppetry and it is a back on a puppetry and that's how she sells houses like like whatever it is and just one of those things about that because I remember the old days when I was in the middle of the day.
[00:24:13] I used to clubhouse and we'd tell people about stories and I want to remind everyone out there like we think our stories have to be so like wild and crazy and like the reason I'm a real estate agent say like ran into a house and saved a family and I was like this is my moment like it is not always be like that it can be that natural moment like.
[00:24:31] The thing that we all want to connect to we want like the people want to have the realness and the personal connection the relate ability and that can just be an everyday story that you dive into and find this the juicy parts.
[00:24:43] Share it and give us some takeaways and you can take with us and I want to say as kind of a video coach and a former journalist it took me a long time and I do want to flag for agents out there who are feeling like am I really worthy of getting press or I'm not big enough to get press or I'm not experienced enough to get press I do want to say number one.
[00:25:03] Everyone has something valuable to say if you're showing up on social media and sharing your tips and you've helped people buy and sell homes for X number of years you your information has value I also want to say that similar to when people make content for social media I see from clients and for myself there's a natural lean in so some of us feel more comfortable with the expert tips and some of us feel more comfortable with the personal storytelling and so don't be afraid to get to the point of view of the world.
[00:25:33] I just lean into the side that you feel more comfortable with so I will say like for me I can teach video like all day long and it has taken me a few more years to like kind of feel comfortable being like I'm going to pitch a story about me being a working mom or me quitting my job and building my business and so just that's okay to say I feel super comfortable pitching the buying tips or prepping your home for all open house market I feel super comfortable and you know commenting on the bill the big beautiful business.
[00:26:03] Like the bill and how that might impact your sales impact your home selling or buying it's okay if you feel really comfortable with either experts tips or piggybacking off of new stories down the road you can sort of say is there some softer story and likewise the other way I would say some people feel really comfortable saying.
[00:26:20] And I left a really incredible career in,
[00:26:24] as a gym teacher, and now I'm an agent
[00:26:26] and things that I find that are similar,
[00:26:28] or whatever, right, whatever your personal story is.
[00:26:30] Some people feel very comfortable with that.
[00:26:32] Lean into that.
[00:26:33] So kind of like, I guess my major advice is,
[00:26:37] A, everyone can get pressed, don't feel like you're not
[00:26:39] famous enough, you're not big enough,
[00:26:41] you haven't sold enough homes.
[00:26:42] And then the second thing is, don't feel
[00:26:45] that there's only one way to do it.
[00:26:46] Do the way that feels right to you.
[00:26:50] Yes.
[00:26:50] The entryway.
[00:26:51] Yeah.
[00:26:52] And to Sabina's point, like, I want you to today,
[00:26:54] you're going to listen to this.
[00:26:55] I want you to write down one thing that you think
[00:26:58] would help people.
[00:26:59] If you think it would help people, it would help people
[00:27:02] via the press.
[00:27:03] So whether that's a tip or a current seasonal story,
[00:27:07] I just think sort of start with what you know,
[00:27:09] like this is a way to move forward.
[00:27:11] And can I tell you just to inspire them,
[00:27:14] as we are literally talking, I googled real simple
[00:27:16] magazine in real estate, because that's an easy way

And now onto our show. Today's episode is brought to you by Corded.io. Are you looking for agents to join your brokerage or team? Now, as a real estate recruiter, I can tell you the answer is always yes. But most agents aren't looking to move right now. So how do you know who to contact? Well, what if I were to tell you there's a recruiting and retention tool powered by artificial intelligence that shows you exactly which agents in your local market are looking to leave their brokerage right now and which agents at your own firm are also looking to leave you? Now, I've been recruiting REALTORS for 15 years and I've hired over 2000 agents. I can tell you with no exaggeration. This is the tool I've been waiting for. Corded.io looks for trends across dozens of variables for each agent in your market and shows you which agents they believe are likely to move. Not only does it do that. But Corded.io went and visited my recruiting website and read everything I offer. So now when I'm recruiting, Corded.io tells me exactly what to say based on that agent's needs and what my brokerage can offer. It even writes emails for me. I've never seen anything like it and I use it every single day. Now, if you are looking to grow your brokerage, Corded.io is the best tool out there. Visit Corded.io to schedule a demo again. That's Corded.io and now on to the show. Hello, keep your real listeners. I am Kim Rickberg and I feel as listen to this show before. I guess to host about once a month and I generally teach agents how to make better video and how to show up confidently on camera. And you know, if you've listened to any of my last past episodes or I'll just tell you why. But if you learn how to convert your content into cash, that is the key to growing as an agent in the modern era where social media is so important. So I recommend you listen to some past episodes if you're really interested in diving deep into a video. But today I'm really excited to bring in a special guest. So Sabina Hitchin is here. She is known as the PR Fairy Godmother. Why are we talking about PR? People are probably like Kim is a video person. Why is she talking here? So real estate agents, of course, are showing up on social media more and more. But if you want to get featured in the press, Sabina Hitchin is the person you need to know. So I'm bringing her in here and she's going to give you really amazing advice on how real estate agents can get featured in the press a little bit about Sabina. She is an educator, an entrepreneur, a speaker and a small business media strategist. She's dedicated over 17 years to spotlighting small business owners and entrepreneurs. She's the founder and CEO of press for success. It's a membership community that helps people get themselves publicity entrepreneur magazine even highlighted its ability to turn small business owners into confident PR. Sabina used to be a high school teacher and curriculum designer. And then she was in New York in New York City doing PR for over a decade. And she's been featured in various media outlets, including Good Morning America Forbes NBC News ABC News entrepreneur USA today, the near post and more. And make sure to follow her at Sabina S a B I N A K N O W S Sabina knows across all platforms and she lives in Portland, mean with her husband, daughter and dog George Michael Sabina. Thank you for joining us. I'm so excited to talk about this because I always get hyped about what you're doing for the real estate community. Awesome. And so one thing I want to share is before you know adjacent to me being in video, I was actually a TV journalist. I was doing video and journalism. So Sabina as a publicist is someone I would work closely with and respect so much the value of publicity for what it can do for people. So Sabina, talk to me first. Why would a real estate agent want to invest their time or their effort or money or whatever into getting press? Great question. And just probably listening to might be like, what is that even look like when when can I say this we're talking like you sharing your tips on TV or in a website of calm, the newspaper, etc. For free because it's press right so things I like about publicity when you're a real estate agent specifically our number one visibility boosting all of a sudden I'm seeing you and let's be real. Like we're in a crowded market so we want to stand out. So number one all of a sudden if I'm sharing my expert advice on a local morning show or sharing advice on like for first time home sellers on like Cosmo or glamour all of a sudden I'm being seen. And also depending on the type of press you put out there and we'll talk about that a little bit later it helps you differentiate yourself like why am I choosing you and a lot of that can be very personal decision. And so press helps me choose you all of a sudden I'm seeing you on television or I'm reading your story or advice on a local website and I'm like, oh I like this person like I want this Christine selling my house. So there's a lot of to do with like the visibility the differentiation and also the authority I'm trusting you more because people are choosing to talk to you so I see you as a resource quick example I live in Portland Maine where like real estate is wild right now right. And I have seen real estate agents here appearing in national news talking about real estate trends and things like that and now I'm following them on Instagram and like you know with video and social then the funnel begins right now I'm big fans. And I love this so just for people listening to clarify so we're talking about press is being the sort of thing that's giving you credibility that is also when you really think about it's like an outside badge of honor so it is not replacing all your efforts in social media or on video you still need that because you can directly connect with buyers directly connect with sellers and you can also be providing your own expertise. But when you're landing in press it gives you that extra badge of honor as seen in you know local TV has written up on you know whatever you know just trying to think like the real deal whatever so you're getting someone else saying oh Christina's legit like up she is legit and so I think that it's just important to pause right there it doesn't replace it so the PR press is like next to what you're doing for yourself on your social media on your video on your blog on your news. So okay we're going to move on now but I wanted to pause because I talk a lot about social media and video but the value of press is really important and I just like it was a one quick thing like him is so right and what I love to picture at press for success we say like picture wheel and it's like content community publicity spinning around together and they all or like a three leg of so they all need to show up because I want to see you in all those places just like you're working so hard to become part of your communities in different ways and spending that money that content is really important. Content me the video content the social and the publicity all but together make to the real estate agent that stands out or agency love that so now I want to get right into the nitty gritty so you know let's say you have an agent and this person let's we're going to call her Lauren Lauren wants to get press what what are the first things she should do and I know that we're going to jump into the three types of things that she should be pitching what's first thing Lauren should do if she says I want to go and try to get her. I want to get press for myself and you're right because it's not like just like Lauren and run towards the media you I like to take a step back and be like what is everything I need to show up like the real estate expert I need to be so they choose me so things and if you know Kim you're probably in the lucky boat already because it's things like number one do I have some place that showcases who I am some kind of website or landing page or even Instagram these days that showcases like me I look trustworthy I look like I can speak on camera like you want that video on that page so I'm like oh Lauren. Lauren feels like the right kind of person for our program or even our dot com like she feels legit right if you're aiming towards TV prior to even pitching you want to make sure you have a photo be role of yourself doing different things like you know something that symbolizes video that symbolizes your real estate life like stacking all that stuff up in advance so that when you're ready to show up like the story ideas almost the least important part it's like are all your ducks in a row and the last thing I'm going to say is if you want this to do it you want to do it. Maybe something you want to do and I think you should it so powerful and you need to start getting in that ecosystem this is like a talent of real estate people so like I'm going to start following the people who do real estate stories and not just like New York time was also a journal but like people are talking about home buying and selling everywhere from AARP to Oprah daily so I'm starting to like look at where real estate conversations show up or similar conversations about like money and wealth and resources that your demographic cares about. So you could be like hmm I can start getting to know these spaces because I belong in them and I feel just really say people understand that because they understand relationships so if I'm like this is it yeah Kim I want to do this. You really want to go beyond just like getting yourself ready start watching the places real estate conversations show up looking at the press how they're talking about it so you can start seeing yourself in those places. And a couple of things to be said so for those of you who don't know what B-roll is no problem just follow me on Instagram and I'll tell you drop me a line of B-roll. I literally interview you about it. Yeah. One of the things that was mentioning is basically if you want to be interviewed on TV they're going to want to see they're going to say Lauren is a real estate agent in Portland Maine they're just going to want to see some footage of you looking at floor plans of you at your computer. It's like it's not that complicated but it is something that you know you don't have until you're pursuing press or until you're active with your social media. It's just something that she was mentioning and then Sabina I do think you mentioned a couple of outlets but talk to me about starting locally like those are really where people have the relationship so talk to me about how an agent Lauren can be starting to build her relationships with her local press to start to get featured locally first. Exactly and we'll talk about the specific stories in a sec but I want you to start saying okay I want to serve and I want you to like erase any thought of your head of like I'm being a pastor I'm like being so salesy like you are serving up real estate information to people who need it real estate is a wild hot topic it has been for years now so the people in your hometown are curious what do I need to know you're not trying to sell your agency or self you're being like a resource so what you want to start doing is looking again like we're not going to be able to see what you're doing and what you're doing. Where are they talking about real estate related stories in my local hometown newspaper or regional newspaper. Where are they talking about it on local TV and again it doesn't have to be on the nose but you're like okay this is something where they've said like oh like in Portland made real estate is always a hot topic so you see it appearing on certain news shows you start saying okay these are the places I belong every one of you has a local CBS ABC NBC Fox you do you have to watch it in real time start stream. I'm assuming and getting to know those places and getting to know the reporters where they're like that's the basic research you start doing because that's where we're eventually going to take the key stories I'm going to talk to you about in a second but you can't be like I want to be on TV in Nashville and not know any TV shows that are national you want to be like oh I got I know talk of the town is in Nashville I know wake up Nashville like you want to know those things because you're going to be serving yourself up to those places as an amazing resource. And a reminder to anyone who's still you know a little camera shy you don't have to be aiming for local TV it can be local yes yes or digital so you know we all have our local paper so I live in Brooklyn New York the Brooklyn Eagle Brooklyn paper and then you might say what about the New York Daily News what about the New York Post so it's your local TV there's really when you think about it like look at your table look at your kitchen table what are the magazines newspapers landing doorstep or what are the Instagram handles you follow locally. And then you're kind of going to build that list of okay here's three places six places 10 places that I actually read that people I know read and Sabina mentioned something earlier I think is really important that we can we'll talk about next is when you're pitching yourself is like when you read a story and there's an expert quoted you can be that person quoted so it must be like you know I live in New York so it's not necessarily be like Lauren like a feature on Lauren this real estate agent in New York unless you're doing something super interesting. And amazing it's kind of hard to get a feature but it might be like wow like you know this. Seven new developments what up in Queens here's Lauren. And in Queens to comment on that trend so again exactly we're really talking about you getting featured in the press but maybe don't think about who's going to feature me like it is hard to get a story where you're on the front page but it's a different like a lighter lift to get quoted to get exactly. And you're still getting those logos and those relationships and also if you're one of those people is like not me on TV baby not yet just like we're talking about those newspapers and dot coms that is a place where I'm also like if you can do it locally like if you can draw a small circle you can draw a big circle so if you're okay to like pitch your local newspaper. And you have a great trend to report on it like you like don't sell don't try to buy your first house in this economy until you do this you can also be pitching that to. Cosmo dot com glamor dot com like where the people reading who are buying first home homes and you're pursuing them that way so again that's easier it's not TV it becomes very similar to finding homes locally. Home through your story sorry awesome and now so we know let's jump into I know you have three type stories that real estate agent should be pitching to get themselves press let's talk about those. Yeah you already started with me so we'll go to that so my two favorites for real estate agents that book consistently are again when you show up as a service provider in the sense like I'm going to give you everything you need to know about the real estate space so. That is going to land in the form of expert tips right seasonal evergreen expert advice again like don't buy your first home until you this or how to stage your home or if there's a you know so like anything like an expert advice from your industry that people will find. So useful if you can make it seasonal even better so you're providing advice the second part is piggybacking on hot topics in the news and that's a power play for real estate people because every day there is something about the real estate market that you can take and say hey they just announced this or this is happening with interest rates let me translate that for the people of Kalamazoo Michigan let me translate that like what is that mean for local Chicagoans or so like you're saying new development coming up what is that mean. So again if you can start saying okay what expert advice do I have to give that seasonal or juicy or what is happening in the world of real estate or real estate adjacent that would impact my future or current customers and I'm going to become a resource of that information beginning locally because it's easy like bumpers on a bowling lane like I can start here but that's not going to be a good thing. But then I encourage you to start saying to yourself okay if I'm okay talking to my local demo customers like local newspaper about like in this economy don't think about selling your house until you do this or don't think about buying a house until you do this. Well why couldn't I say that same thing to Oprah.com where people are talking about this or ABC news.com or CNN.com so just remembering you can do that same thing many places but the expert tips and the piggybacking are where we kick off and if I can just add one little thing to the fire before we go on to another idea but I'm expert tips if you want to get a little bit deeper can also expand like if I'm a real estate agent like Lauren and I want people to choose to do that. Yes I want them to see me as an expert yes I want them to see me as an authority piggybacking on things but I want them to choose me in a way that they like I feel like they know me so sometimes for that when I'm working with a real estate agent I will slide in anecdotal wisdom like how I went from a high school teacher to really say agent and like why that pivot changed my life or how I'm working and being a mom with summer camp like something that is just allowing me to make my real estate career the better way to do that. I'm giving advice to other working moms or people pursuing a pivot or something like that so then I'm able to share another side of myself so of course I lean into the expert real estate tips first or the piggybacking but I believe once you start that machine going you should consider are there other parts of my life that I'm very good at that are adjacent to real estate maybe it's like how you stay productive during the summer months as a world. I'm working with her and or God help me like all those things so those types of expert advice is anecdotal wisdom you have as a person of working and living and whatever existence you are is another layer just to put in your back pocket because when you're a real estate agent you want someone to choose you and sometimes that comes from knowing you a little bit more than just your advice does that make sense. Yeah my tips would be like how does they productive during the summer don't try just getting sit and enjoy the weather while you're on those new meetings but I mean but they like think you're funny. Right exactly so one thing I was just thinking about so I have a client Kathleen who's an agent in Texas and she had a social media post a video about what does Trump's big beautiful bill mean for you as a buyer. Yes and it performed really well so one thing you could be thinking about as you're thinking about your expert tips what are the sort of ideas you're talking you're making for content that's like reactive to the news or seasons and then you can also say what do people ask me a lot about like you know when there's a new bill or when there's a new season or if the interest rate changes you're going to get a lot of the same questions so you know so you're recommending use that those are sort of things that are in there that's the kind of idea you should pitch okay so we have actually you see a performance on Instagram I was going to say if it performs well and socially it's likely to perform well statistically and historically in the press like it's people so you're like whoa this tells me people are interested the press are people to totally okay great so what is the second type of story agents should be pitching. Okay so expert tips are jumble the second was piggybacking so there's like two separate the third thing I want you to do and we can break those down a little bit more but again like expert tips number one so I'm thinking industry base and I'm thinking at a total when I feel it when I have something that feels purposeful the second type of story you want to be monitoring for is the piggybacking again like piggybacking on hot topics survey studies and if you are serious about press and you're listening to him and me right now I want you to act like you're not going to be a good guy. Actually you say to yourself instead of being like this is so interesting be like okay first challenge is like what set of expert tips could I put on my calendar for this month whenever you are receiving and thinking about this like what or maybe looking ahead what is one set of expert tips I could put on my calendar for next month that would be seasonal and timely and juicy because you need to knock over that first domino right and start the the train of stories going and I would be showing up like once a month with a new set of expert tips. And then also be pitching out to the back you can totally and then also because I know that if you're a regular here you hear from Kim like you follow Kim on social would you show it like you know that you're so passionate about video because then I'm a producer or report even a newspaper reporter and I'm like oh okay I'm going to go check out Lauren on Instagram to make sure she feels legit and not like it a robot then I'm like whoa she actually was just on her soapbox about the big beautiful bill and what it means to our home mind and now I am going to do it. I'm going to see her energy and I'm like yes this is so interesting so again you're multi-purposing that content if you're somebody who does a newsletter you can even send that off to your customer newsletter right your YouTube there's so many ways to do it. So again we're doing expert set of tips we're piggybacking and the last one that I love to lean into because I see real estate agents as entrepreneurs of their own kind right there doing the work they're marketing them putting themselves out there they're leading you to the market. So I like to find some way to weave in our founder story right like again meet the local mom who built a real estate empire from the shores of Portland Maine or meet the local real estate group that has donated like you know $10,000 a charity in the past month or this it like meet the two sisters who started who are like working in real estate together find out their advice and how to work with your sibling and still love each other at the end of the day. So you're thinking like what is my story I met someone I think through you Kim Debbie was that it. Yes I was like your star like you so interesting and I'm like I want to hear every part of your story I love how you work with your family I love how you're in your head like 10 things like this is fascinating to me and so your local press if it's not set up as a commercial for you but like a story and again real estate is just like the canvas at which you're telling your story of a pivot of a transformation of a choice to work with someone like a partner or a spouse or a kid like. All of that is just story telling at the end of the day so if you can start to say like where is the story behind what I do what is the why behind what I do we're used to one who was like selling lemonade as a kid and now you're selling homes where you like. I forgot a college totally pivoted out of a science career and accidentally became a real estate agent like tell us those stories provide a little takeaway for the reader or the viewer that and then look around locally first and then beyond and say where are people talking about. Pivots or stories or carrying stories of local people and then how can I walk myself into that instead of feeling like a commercial about myself feeling like a story that local people like I never knew that. Carol has a puppetry thing like you know what I mean does that make sense Carol love puppetry and it is a back on a puppetry and that's how she sells houses like like whatever it is and just one of those things about that because I remember the old days when I was in the middle of the day. I used to clubhouse and we'd tell people about stories and I want to remind everyone out there like we think our stories have to be so like wild and crazy and like the reason I'm a real estate agent say like ran into a house and saved a family and I was like this is my moment like it is not always be like that it can be that natural moment like. The thing that we all want to connect to we want like the people want to have the realness and the personal connection the relate ability and that can just be an everyday story that you dive into and find this the juicy parts. Share it and give us some takeaways and you can take with us and I want to say as kind of a video coach and a former journalist it took me a long time and I do want to flag for agents out there who are feeling like am I really worthy of getting press or I'm not big enough to get press or I'm not experienced enough to get press I do want to say number one. Everyone has something valuable to say if you're showing up on social media and sharing your tips and you've helped people buy and sell homes for X number of years you your information has value I also want to say that similar to when people make content for social media I see from clients and for myself there's a natural lean in so some of us feel more comfortable with the expert tips and some of us feel more comfortable with the personal storytelling and so don't be afraid to get to the point of view of the world. I just lean into the side that you feel more comfortable with so I will say like for me I can teach video like all day long and it has taken me a few more years to like kind of feel comfortable being like I'm going to pitch a story about me being a working mom or me quitting my job and building my business and so just that's okay to say I feel super comfortable pitching the buying tips or prepping your home for all open house market I feel super comfortable and you know commenting on the bill the big beautiful business. Like the bill and how that might impact your sales impact your home selling or buying it's okay if you feel really comfortable with either experts tips or piggybacking off of new stories down the road you can sort of say is there some softer story and likewise the other way I would say some people feel really comfortable saying. And I left a really incredible career in, as a gym teacher, and now I'm an agent and things that I find that are similar, or whatever, right, whatever your personal story is. Some people feel very comfortable with that. Lean into that. So kind of like, I guess my major advice is, A, everyone can get pressed, don't feel like you're not famous enough, you're not big enough, you haven't sold enough homes. And then the second thing is, don't feel that there's only one way to do it. Do the way that feels right to you. Yes. The entryway. Yeah. And to Sabina's point, like, I want you to today, you're going to listen to this. I want you to write down one thing that you think would help people. If you think it would help people, it would help people via the press. So whether that's a tip or a current seasonal story, I just think sort of start with what you know, like this is a way to move forward. And can I tell you just to inspire them, as we are literally talking, I googled real simple magazine in real estate, because that's an easy way to be like, what are people talking? And literally a month ago, when the headlines on their website was five expensive mistakes, first time a home seller is always make, according to the real estate pros. And of course, people were weighing in. So people want you. They are ready for you. And yes, find the way that feels like a nice gateway into like, like somebody here are here to serve. What is the way that you could show up and what could you share? I love that idea, Kim. And I think I mentioned this at the beginning, but I spent, you know, 10 years in TV. And I have been pitched so many stories. I love Sabina's tips. I think they are so spot on. And they're really like step by step. So as we wrap up Sabina, let people know where they can find you, how they can work with you. Yes. First of all, yes, come find me. Let Kim, I love to share stories and give advice and everything on social media. So come find me at Sabina Nose, KNOWS, on social, but also at pressversuccess.com, where we have workshops every week.
