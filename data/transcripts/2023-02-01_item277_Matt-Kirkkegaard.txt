[00:02:30] My conversation with Matt Kierkegaard.
[00:02:44] Today on the show, we have Matt Kierkegaard, a bloated property group in Nashville.
[00:02:48] Let me tell you more about Matt.
[00:02:51] Now, Matt Kierkegaard has been a Nashville resident since 2008.
[00:02:55] As a professional musician, he has lived and worked in every area of Nashville and the
[00:03:00] surrounding areas.
[00:03:00] He has a passion for Nashville and a passion for people.
[00:03:04] Matt and his team bring a deep level of simplicity and honesty to the buying process.
[00:03:09] They strive to make the process of buying a home an exciting one.
[00:03:13] Matt also started a program called Lift Up, where 10% of his company's profits go to
[00:03:18] the Lift Up Fund, which provides mortgage and rent relief for struggling families and
[00:03:23] individuals.

[00:03:36] We will have links to those social platforms in the show notes.
[00:03:39] Matt, welcome to the show.
[00:03:41] Hey, thanks for having me.
[00:03:43] Yeah, super excited to chat.
[00:03:45] But right before we were going alive, I was telling Matt, the last time I was in Nashville
[00:03:50] was for the eclipse.
[00:03:52] And I was like, Oh, were you there?
[00:03:53] And you were in Puerto Rico.
[00:03:55] And I was saying, it was really a cool thing because, and I don't know that most people
[00:03:59] knew this.
[00:04:00] I certainly didn't, was that because we were at Nashville, which was considered like
[00:04:04] a perfect latitude, longitudinal point to be able to see the eclipse, we were able
[00:04:10] to safely take our glasses off and stare directly at the eclipse only for a minute or so.
[00:04:16] But there, because we were at that one space, we were actually able to see it without glasses.
[00:04:21] And it really was, I honestly, I think it's the most beautiful thing I've ever seen.
[00:04:24] I love that.
[00:04:25] Aside from being in beautiful Nashville, which is also just such a dream place to I always
[00:04:31] fantasize if I was going to move Charleston or Nashville, maybe be my daughter.
[00:04:36] Anyway, enough about me.
[00:04:37] Let's talk about you.
[00:04:38] Thanks for.
[00:04:39] Thanks for coming on the show.
[00:04:41] And let's actually, I'd love to hear about how you got into real estate.
[00:04:45] I know you're a musician.
[00:04:47] So and still a musician.
[00:04:48] So I'd love to hear about, you know, how you had, you know, the path you had through
[00:04:52] a musician ship and also real estate and how you married the two.
[00:04:57] Yeah, how long do we have?
[00:04:58] I mean, a few hours, right?
[00:05:00] I mean, it's, it's, it's, it's kind of a crazy story.
[00:05:04] I, yes, I just said I'm a musician.
[00:05:05] I, I grew up music's kind of been my only most of my life.
[00:05:09] I started playing professionally.
[00:05:10] I was nine.
[00:05:11] And so I've never known anything else.
[00:05:13] And so what's school for music?
[00:05:15] I went to Nashville for music.
[00:05:17] And, and for all intents and purposes, I really made it in the music industry or started,
[00:05:20] you know, kind of my, my bustling music career and was on a good trajectory and moving forward
[00:05:26] really well.
[00:05:29] And met a girl as all of the stories start.
[00:05:33] Married said girl and in our, in our,
[00:05:36] shortly after we got married, actually, we had a family member that basically stole a lot
[00:05:42] of money from us left us with a pretty intense amount of debt.
[00:05:45] And long story short, we lost our house.
[00:05:47] We were homeless for year and a half.
[00:05:48] And, and I say homeless, my wife's corrected me many times on this.
[00:05:51] We weren't fully homeless.
[00:05:52] We had lots of friends that offered up their couch or a spot in a garage or, you know,
[00:05:58] their driveway for our car or whatever.
[00:05:59] So we had, we had lots of lots of people who stepped in and took care of us during that
[00:06:03] season, but we were unable to, we did not have our own space for a year and a half.
[00:06:07] And, um, living in the same school you were still performing during that time.
[00:06:11] I was.
[00:06:12] Yeah.
[00:06:12] Some music was still the primary at that time, which, you know, I made okay money
[00:06:15] in music, but not enough to recover loss like that.
[00:06:17] And this was, you know, pretty substantial.
[00:06:19] So we had, you know, still, an extraordinary hurdle to get over in order to even get us
[00:06:24] back to solvent and ground zero and pursuing a music career and a life as a musician is
[00:06:29] hard enough, let alone adding that to it.
[00:06:31] It just kind of became a non starter.
[00:06:33] And so I pivoted a, a buddy of mine at the time, worked as a mortgage lender.
[00:06:38] He's like, maybe you should get your real estate license and all send you a deal once
[00:06:40] a while and do the math and the money.
[00:06:43] As a musician, the money looked really great and feels like, man, I know a lot of people.
[00:06:47] If you are a musician, you've made it as a professional musician in a national tendency,
[00:06:50] you know how to network like nobody's business.
[00:06:52] And so I know people and I'm relational and I love diving into people in their stories.
[00:06:56] And so I could, hey, I owned a buyer's house.
[00:06:59] I can help them with that.
[00:07:02] And that's at least some money that I would not have had any other way.
[00:07:05] So I was, of course, working about five days and the way to do it really, yeah,
[00:07:11] just knock it out.
[00:07:12] Because I always, I always tell people who are taking their classes.
[00:07:15] I'm like, you're going to forget it anyway.
[00:07:16] You might as well forget it after the test.
[00:07:18] So do it as quick as possible.
[00:07:19] There's not a single thing in that class or in that education process that I've actually
[00:07:24] applied realistically in my career.
[00:07:28] And so anyway, sorry, state of Tennessee real estate exam, but it ended up just being
[00:07:33] something I could kind of blow through and then learn the practical side of it on the other side of it.
[00:07:38] But I just dove in and again, I tell people a time, you know, part of my success story is a
[00:07:42] fact and when you don't have another option, but for it to work, it has to work.
[00:07:45] And you figure out how to make it work.
[00:07:47] And so I got very, very determined, driven to figure out how to recover from this
[00:07:52] because the other side of this is that I really am passionate about music and I knew music was where
[00:07:57] I needed to be in my career path.
[00:07:58] And I don't have a long time to take my time recovering from this.
[00:08:03] I need to get to the other side of this and get back to music.
[00:08:05] And that really was my goal for the whole first part of my career.
[00:08:09] And then there's been some shifts and some additions in there, which I'm sure we'll get to.
[00:08:13] So ultimately for me, it was out of necessity that this kind of came up.
[00:08:16] Real estate was never on my on my purview.
[00:08:19] And it was just a mention.
[00:08:21] And what's amazing is I'm really grateful for that moment because real estate is such an
[00:08:25] incredible tool in vehicle as an agent, but also learning the investor side of it and how
[00:08:29] property ownership leads to wealth building and passive income.
[00:08:32] And there's so many pieces of real estate that I never knew.
[00:08:36] Super countercultural in my from my world, my parents, you know, people that had given me
[00:08:42] financial advice up to that point in my mid 20s.
[00:08:45] I had heard very polar opposite advice from when I started being in the real estate
[00:08:49] industry watching investors who were making a lot of money.
[00:08:52] I started weighing those two things and realizing that there's
[00:08:56] maybe another path here and a whole bunch of stuff that I didn't know before that could help me
[00:09:01] become a little bit more financially solvent and still have the freedom and capacity to pursue
[00:09:05] music and do that. I want to do that too. So anyway, that's how my real estate career started and how
[00:09:09] it kind of developed there.
[00:09:11] Wow, well, there is, I'd love to unpack some of that. So number one,
[00:09:16] when you were talking about, I know you've recovered since otherwise I wouldn't make any joke at all.
[00:09:21] But I was like, well, at least it was a family member.
[00:09:24] Right. Sure.
[00:09:26] If it can't be family stealing, I don't know. No, I mean, it's awful.
[00:09:32] Awful. It was, it was really heartbreaking and it was on top of a lot of other things.
[00:09:36] My wife and I, there's like the barnest statistics of the top 20 stressors and marriage experiences
[00:09:40] in a lifetime. And we hit 18 of them our first year of our marriage. And so I really was just a
[00:09:46] hellish hellish season for sure. And I can look back at that now. And there were actually a lot of
[00:09:50] beautiful moments in there. My wife might feel like we've been married for 40 years when in reality,
[00:09:54] we've only been married. It probably brought, brought you both a lot closer together because you
[00:09:58] had to be band together as a team and really, really figure life out when you were at this huge
[00:10:04] disadvantage. So in some ways, it again, not that there's that it's a good thing. It's not the ideal.
[00:10:09] But the result of the less than ideal is that we clung to each other for survival and we figured
[00:10:14] out him forward. And that doesn't mean by any stretch that it's been easy. And we've had an immense
[00:10:18] amount of hard in our marriage. Which I think marriage is supposed to be hard. Everything worth
[00:10:23] while is hard. Yeah. However, through a lot of counseling and a lot of therapy, which we're
[00:10:27] still going through and I'm too proponent of therapy, we are recovering from the trauma and we
[00:10:32] are still married and still trying to fight for something we believe in. So, but I do think that
[00:10:38] that early part of that definitely got us real real fast with each other. Got us real with
[00:10:45] ourselves real fast and I figured out what it looks like to believe in yourself when honestly no
[00:10:53] one else does or no one else can because there's nothing to believe in at the moment in that way.
[00:10:57] So you just kind of just charge forward. And again, when you have to do it, you don't have an
[00:11:02] option but to do it. You do it. You figured out. It is like that. It's that expression. What is
[00:11:08] it? Necessity is the mother of invention. Which is absolutely. It's like it's so interesting when
[00:11:15] because people will call me a lot who are in the process of getting their real estate license and
[00:11:20] they'll ask the the biggest question I think that people like me who are recruiters get from
[00:11:25] people who are entering the businesses. Well, I want a steady income. So I'm going to stay part time
[00:11:31] for now. And what do you think about that? And it's I always say, well, nobody can give you the
[00:11:36] right answer. I said, however, people will tell you that there's no way to do it part time and that
[00:11:42] full times really the only way. And while in theory, I think that probably is the right approach for
[00:11:47] most people. I have seen people do it part time, but the people that do it part time because they
[00:11:53] want that steady income from their pre you know, their current job. I understand that I get that.
[00:11:58] But I think what you're saying actually does tend to bring out the best of somebody when you cut off
[00:12:05] the the the lifeline and you're like, I'm just going to make this work. I'm going to figure it out
[00:12:10] like you guys were in that forced to situation. It does actually seem to get make people more resilient
[00:12:17] and they're able to sort of find resources when they have that lifeline. It's harder. I think to
[00:12:22] access that drive when you're trying to do two things at once. Not to say that you can't be done. I've
[00:12:27] had people on the show who started part time for years and was able to then be eventually become a
[00:12:32] top producer. But I think that I think that extends the journey by doing it. I was going to say my
[00:12:37] argument therapy is that those years that they weren't a top producer would have been erased.
[00:12:42] Had they just gone full in? Can I parallel it to music permanent? I like I said, I've done music
[00:12:47] whole life. So that really is my background. I went to school for music in Los Angeles. And my
[00:12:51] first day, freshman 101 class, this was a commercial commercial music business class. I was a commercial
[00:12:55] music major with the piano performance emphasis. And first day, music business 101, there's 68
[00:13:00] freshmen in this class. And the professor comes in kind of blows through the doors. Doesn't really
[00:13:05] even argue to himself. Just kind of sets a briefcase down and says, how many of you guys have a plan B?
[00:13:09] And my immediate thing is, well, this is where I get the lecture about how I need to have a plan B
[00:13:13] because music's so unstable and you've got to have a backup plan blah blah. And I have a vendetta
[00:13:19] against plan B's and that has never been me. So I didn't raise my hand really ready to fight this
[00:13:22] like you don't have a plan B when you're a musician. And oddly enough, 38 kids rose raised their
[00:13:28] hands with their plan B's and he just moved from the class. Because if you have a plan B,
[00:13:34] you will end up taking it. You probably shouldn't end up taking it. And honestly, you're wasting my
[00:13:38] time and yours. So there's the door. And obviously it's a little nicer than that. But at the end of
[00:13:43] the day, he made the comment after you left that the people make it in music are the ones who will
[00:13:47] make it or die trying. And those are your options. There's no option. There's no other plan B
[00:13:50] because music is notorious, a notoriously difficult career to enter into and it's going to take
[00:13:56] everything you've got to get there. I would say that's true with entrepreneurship, with leadership,
[00:14:00] with ownership, with any company, any of that, that's the reality. Because if you are not willing
[00:14:04] to literally risk it all and put 100% of it online, then that doesn't happen. And it's not going
[00:14:11] to happen until you're ready to do that. And so trying to weigh some sort of safety net of a
[00:14:18] steady income or whatever and then still trying to start something else. Even if you're one of the
[00:14:23] lucky few who kind of balanced that and get to some place where that happens, it's going to take an
[00:14:28] extraordinarily, it's going to take a much longer period of time to get there. Then if you just
[00:14:31] are 100%, you're going to get it down, you're going to want, which is why entrepreneurs,
[00:14:35] clinical entrepreneurs, you know, Elon Musk's and Steve Jobs and these big folks,
[00:14:40] clinically, they do something they start it, they get it running and they move on to the next thing
[00:14:43] and fire people to run the thing for them. Because at the end of the day, the folks that
[00:14:47] are able to do that are the ones that are just 100% and they're going to establish something and
[00:14:51] they're going to move on to the next thing. And so I think that for me getting thrown into that,
[00:14:56] already having my background in music, my wife and I are both notorious risk takers as it is.
[00:15:00] So we're not, we have no risk of version anyway. But there was just, that was an easy transition
[00:15:04] press to be right in that, right in that mix and just go for it. It reminds me speaking of like a
[00:15:08] musical metaphor that I think speaks to what you were just saying. I don't remember who the musician
[00:15:13] was who did this. I don't know. It was a violinist and I don't know if it's a pro-menor. I don't
[00:15:18] think it was him. But if somebody else, some some super famous violinist considered best in the
[00:15:23] world at, you know, 23 years ago, whatever. Anyway, so they was at a party, somebody was at a party
[00:15:27] in New York ran into this person and was like, oh my gosh, I'm such a huge fan. I wish I could play
[00:15:33] the violin like you or I think it was violin. Maybe it was cello, the Gio-Yoma or something.
[00:15:37] Whatever. It doesn't matter. Somebody super famous. And he goes, no, I'm totally
[00:15:42] misremembering who the person was, but doesn't matter because what the person said was so, so the
[00:15:46] someone went up, I wish I could play like you. I, oh no, he said, I give my life to play like you.
[00:15:51] That's what the fan said. And he goes, no, you wouldn't because he goes, yeah, exactly. He goes,
[00:15:57] no, you wouldn't because I did. And he goes, you don't, you, you aren't. And it wasn't trying to be
[00:16:02] mean. He was like, he was, you don't understand. Like, this is all I do. This is what I do. And
[00:16:07] I, you know, I, and he's like, if you're willing to give up everything else, then yes, you could
[00:16:12] probably play like me. And that's, and that's not to say that you can't have balance in your life.
[00:16:17] Obviously, everyone we should strive for that. And having, you know, personal and professional,
[00:16:22] you know, balance with, with our activities, that being said, it is like one of those things. You
[00:16:32] know, even if it doesn't work, I still think the lessons learned from putting in a solid, you
[00:16:38] know, attempt will then lead you to the next thing, even if that failure is never, it shouldn't
[00:16:45] be a negative. No, it's just simply a stepping stone. It's a, hey, I learned how not to do
[00:16:50] something when they go do it differently and do it again. And I think you said balance. And I'm
[00:16:54] definitely a component of balance. I am anti-workaholic for sure. And you have, I think you need to
[00:17:00] really align your priorities and figure out what takes priority in your life. And of course, for me,
[00:17:03] my family is a huge priority, my kids. And there's nothing real, state or music, actually,
[00:17:08] that will ever take precedence over them at the end of the day. But, but in that, I think that you,
[00:17:16] I still think that the things that you're going to put yourself to, you're going to find more
[00:17:21] success in those things that you're willing to put yourself 100% into those things and be fully
[00:17:25] present and fully there and 100% committed. And taking the safe route almost always keeps you in
[00:17:31] the safe zone, which is, which is some sort of a, a mediocre, not a mediocre and a bad way,
[00:17:35] the mediocre mid-level average zone. The people that get above that are the ones that are willing
[00:17:40] to kind of take the risks to get there. So I think risk is the key component to this, no matter where
[00:17:44] you are. And that doesn't mean you don't prioritize things that are important. It just means that
[00:17:47] you're willing to jump into those things, those other things that you do full force at first.
[00:17:52] I think too there's there's an aspect. I'm curious to get your thoughts on this. There's an
[00:17:56] aspect of getting comfortable with failure. And I don't mean failure. Obviously, we're talking about
[00:18:01] feedback, you know, things that aren't the ideal outcome that you're shooting for, you, you know,
[00:18:05] just doesn't work. I call it failure, but I don't put a connotation on that. That's a bad thing.
[00:18:10] I just call it all that didn't work. Well, it's called did things that didn't work. I'll say that.
[00:18:14] It's oh, I think the most successful people I know are ones who are like, well, that's just like
[00:18:19] you said, it didn't work. I learned from it. I'm going to try something else. And it's a really
[00:18:22] simple idea, but it's very difficult for a lot of us to sort of get comfortable with that
[00:18:28] discomfort of like, oh, I really went for this and it didn't turn out. So now I have to, like
[00:18:32] you were saying, with your business and you've pivoted multiple times, you've had to pivot
[00:18:36] obviously with your living situation. And that's, you know, that's obviously a very serious and
[00:18:41] difficult, stressful thing. But this idea of being able to just be present for some of these
[00:18:50] these feelings and then go, oh, okay, I'm sad that something didn't work out in the way that I wanted.
[00:18:56] But I'm going to really take it as feedback and then just keep going forward and moving. I think
[00:19:02] is, you know, into a different direction possibly. But I think it's important to get comfortable with,
[00:19:07] you know, things not working out the way that you would anticipate them. And so that way you can just,
[00:19:12] you know, I mean, probably 80% of the as a marketing guy, 80% of the things I do don't provide the
[00:19:18] results I'm really looking for. But yeah, but I think it's a number. It's a number. It's a number.
[00:19:24] It's a first day. And at the end of the day, I think you have, I think I think far too many people
[00:19:27] give far too much time and emotional energy to a failed attempt. Yeah. I think that those things
[00:19:35] come and I'll be on that stings. Okay, back to the drawing board. It should be a pretty quick
[00:19:39] roll off to keep going forward and move forward. And I think if you devote a lot of time and energy,
[00:19:43] you lose any momentum you did have. And then you're always starting from square one or square zero.
[00:19:49] Whereas if you can roll that off, you can still capitalize in some of the momentum that keep
[00:19:52] moving with that. Definitely. And I think that becomes. And again, it doesn't matter who you are.
[00:19:57] You asked anybody in the world who's found any measure of success and any discipline,
[00:20:01] they're going to say that their path to that success has 80% of the time been, oh, I failed
[00:20:08] and I kept going. That's the point. That's how it works. And again, I think part of me is a musician
[00:20:13] comes at that such a natural thing because I was in front of juries and on stage and getting judged
[00:20:17] for my playing since I was nine. So I there was always that, oh, that wasn't great. Here's how
[00:20:22] you do it better. Oh, great. I'll go learn to do it better and blow you away next time. I mean,
[00:20:25] there's just never that was never a problem for me. I have a colleague. I won't mention his name.
[00:20:30] I say, colleague, because he's I'm not a huge huge fan per se of some of the thing, but I'll have to say,
[00:20:35] he went bankrupt to millionaire three times and to get to his multi million dollar world right now,
[00:20:42] he was bankrupt three times back to millionaire. And so he did the bankrupt two millionaire,
[00:20:46] flow three different times. It's third fourth time theoretically got to millionaire and have stayed
[00:20:50] there. But I appreciate that story because at the end of the day, that's just kind of what it is.
[00:20:55] It's a number scheme. You're going to fail. It's going to happen. Fail big win big as an investor.
[00:21:00] I buy a lot of we do a lot of investments and I I chant champion a lot of clients to be investors
[00:21:05] in the market. And I always say two out of 10 times, I'm going to break even maybe make a little bit
[00:21:10] of money five out of 10 times. I'm going to make some money and three out of 10 times. I'm going to
[00:21:15] make a lot. And so then overall, in the course of 10 deals, I've made a lot of money. And I find
[00:21:21] that a lot of my investor friends tend to, I mean, I have one investor right now. He's been wanting
[00:21:25] to invest in Nashville for four years and hasn't pulled the trigger on anything yet because he's too
[00:21:29] scared to lose any money. And I'm like, bro, you could have bought anything four years ago. And you
[00:21:33] would have made money at this point. Like it didn't matter. Like, so I think that at some point,
[00:21:37] you just got to go for it and man, you win something loose on. But as long as you grow and learn
[00:21:42] and win more than you lose, you're good. Well, that and I think there's really even something deeper about
[00:21:47] the example you gave about the gentleman that that went broken millionaire, you know, three
[00:21:52] to three different times is you could take all that person's money away tomorrow. It's already
[00:21:56] happened to him several times. And he's built and he's built it back up. It's so he he is not worried
[00:22:02] about, well, he's probably worried about failure in the sense of he doesn't want to lose what he's
[00:22:06] built. But it's happened to him. And he's like, oh, I know how to do this. I know how to build up from
[00:22:10] nothing. You know how to build from nothing. You have done that. And that is, I mean, that in and
[00:22:17] of itself, it's not something that can easily be taught. It sort of has to be lived. And
[00:22:22] exactly. And there's no shortcut through it. It just is exactly that. But what it does is there's
[00:22:26] a ton of freedom in that. And I wish I could communicate that freedom to someone that hasn't
[00:22:30] experienced it because that would allow them to launch without having to go through it. But I
[00:22:34] don't not tell you sure that's actually possible. But that is a huge part of where my story is,
[00:22:38] is the fact that I'm actually not scared of losing it all except in their dumb that. And so I lose it
[00:22:42] all. I'll figure out how to figure it out again. Like I just I'm not scared of that. Therefore,
[00:22:46] it allows me a lot of freedom to go take those risks and dive in had burst into things that I
[00:22:50] believe in. And, and, you know, so I think that's a huge part of it. I think you're absolutely right.
[00:22:55] If you can get past the fear of losing it all and understanding there's there's just freedom
[00:22:59] and safety in the fact that you're going to be able to keep going. There's no the worst case scenario
[00:23:03] is not really worst case right now. Like it opens it opens you up to keep going forward. You know,
[00:23:09] yeah. Well, at least in this country, we have a lot of opportunity and we're very fortunate to
[00:23:14] to live in a country where there is a lot of economic opportunity for people that are disadvantaged.
[00:23:20] Not that it's easy. Of course, it is not and we should have that but the in compassion for people
[00:23:24] who don't, you know, have have a lot of resources. But, but it is amazing. I'm always so amazed
[00:23:30] that people who just do it and you're right. It's seen I've had a lot of them on my show over the
[00:23:34] years. You're not the first person that has told me they slept in their car. And, and when I,
[00:23:39] I mean, it's in and it's like they just go, well, I just didn't have another option. So that I
[00:23:44] just put everything I had into it. And, and it's, it's that it's that gift of desperation.
[00:23:49] It really is in some ways a gift. Not a fun ride, but it is, it is a ride that'll get you there.
[00:23:55] If, if you can stay in the car the whole time. I think it usually proves something about yourself
[00:23:59] to yourself. Yeah. When you're in that desperation place and you get out of it, you look back
[00:24:04] yourself and you're like, Oh, I don't, I can do that. I'm not scared of my own ability to do that
[00:24:10] anymore. And I think people, I just was having conversation with one of my, one of my, uh,
[00:24:15] girl that works for me yesterday. And we were just talking about how sometimes she, she's second
[00:24:19] guess herself. She's wildly skilled. She's wildly talented, but she doesn't necessarily believe
[00:24:23] in herself a lot. And then hinders her from really stepping into some of that and knowing her value
[00:24:27] as she presents herself. And I was like, you're wildly valuable. You have a ton of skills. You know,
[00:24:31] you're, you're, you have to believe in yourself 100%. Even if no one else does. And the gift of
[00:24:37] desperation, I like how you said that oftentimes gives someone the ability to believe in themselves.
[00:24:42] Because you know, and also is going to do it at that point. You have to believe in yourself to
[00:24:46] get there. So, and I want to, I want to honor you for something that you just said, because I think
[00:24:51] what you just said really highlights why you're, I would assume a very effective and, um, uh, boss
[00:25:00] and mentor because if something you just said that I wonder how many of our audience members have
[00:25:06] heard this from their managing broker where you, you sat somebody down, you know, this, this woman
[00:25:10] who works with you, who is maybe not feeling super confident or struggling with, you know, her own
[00:25:15] capabilities. And you're like, oh, no, you're super talented. You're super skilled. Like you can do
[00:25:20] this. I, I don't think that's all that common. I think there's a lot of training that goes on at
[00:25:25] brokerages. Um, I mean, we certainly do it at our brokerage. There's lots of training and there's
[00:25:29] lots of here the skills, here are the activities. But to be, but to, but to actually say to somebody,
[00:25:34] you're super talented, you have this. I actually think that's pretty rare. And I want to honor you
[00:25:40] for saying that because I bet that was exactly what she wanted or needed to hear in that moment.
[00:25:45] And for you to, to, to give her what she needed, um, I think that is a very special thing that you
[00:25:50] say. I think it's very vulnerable to say that. And, and I think that probably meant a lot to her.
[00:25:54] And I, I would encourage anyone who's listening who has, who is a managing broker who runs a team,
[00:25:59] who has people right now. We know it's a tough time. You know, rates are up inventories down.
[00:26:03] People, brokers are, real tours are struggling. So this is a great time to make sure the people
[00:26:08] that are struggling on your team do know how valuable they are to you and how skilled they are.
[00:26:13] It might just be maybe they're feeling down, but you could maybe lift them. And I, I think, I
[00:26:17] just want to honor you for doing that. Um, that's, that's, that's, that seems so obvious to me. Um,
[00:26:23] yeah, I suspect. But, um, but that being said, I've watched a lot of team leaders bulldoze their,
[00:26:30] their teams before and, and have the, the looming and boss mentality and let me squish you down
[00:26:37] until you submit and do it. And I just think that that's not ever working. Um, I take leadership
[00:26:42] actually as a lowest position on my team. So we usually invert the whole workshop and I'm at the
[00:26:46] bottom and my teams at the top because at the end of the day, they, um, at the end of the day,
[00:26:52] I'm not going to be able to do what I do without them at this point. And I think one of the things
[00:26:56] that you have to understand about people in general, and maybe this is where my, this is probably where
[00:27:00] I'm, I know that I'm a little bit unique in this aspect because I get told that from my partners
[00:27:04] on a regular basis, even, but I, um, I am wildly empathetic. I'm very much a relational person.
[00:27:10] So that's what I do. I dive into relationship and I will, I will give my, I will give myself
[00:27:15] under the bus to ensure that someone else thrives. Um, and, uh, in stepping in with people
[00:27:23] listening to their story, hearing where they're at, hearing who they are, I would challenge anybody
[00:27:27] trying to go to team or any brokers managing individuals leaders, anybody leading anybody else,
[00:27:32] understand that the people and do not only are wildly talented and really skilled set actually
[00:27:37] and really skilled their skill set, their talent, their value is something you could never bring
[00:27:41] to the table. Yep. At the end of the day, I have a skill set that I bring to the table that's very
[00:27:46] valuable. I don't doubt that at all. However, the other people that I work with have a skill set
[00:27:50] that they'd bring to the table that I do not have. And I need to know that they do something better
[00:27:54] than me. And that's okay. My team members under me do things better than I do. That's okay.
[00:27:59] That's not, that's the point. That's why teams work at the end of the day is because other people
[00:28:03] do things better than you do. If everyone did everything as good as me and I just happen to be the one
[00:28:06] of the driver's seat, just a matter of time before someone jumps in the driver's seat and takes
[00:28:10] over from me. Well, normally I wait till the very end to say this, but I want to say it now while
[00:28:15] I think the iron is still hot. Basically, I think what you've demonstrated to a lot of our audiences,
[00:28:20] boy, I wish I had a managing broker or a team lead like that. So if anyone is in the national area,
[00:28:26] I might as well do it now because I honestly think you spoke from the heart. I think I think it was
[00:28:32] a very unique sort of value proposition in a sense and in talking about how you relate to your team
[00:28:39] members and the support you provide to them. If anyone out there is working in the national area,
[00:28:43] and maybe you feel like you're not getting that kind of support or encouragement or empathy or help
[00:28:48] from your existing, I guess they're called managing brokers in Tennessee. I'm guessing, but whoever,
[00:28:54] team lead, whatever, the person in charge, if you're not getting that, you know, reach out to Matt,
[00:28:58] you can go to movementpropertygroup.com. He would love to learn more about you. See if you might be
[00:29:02] a good fit for his, his company. I know we haven't talked much about the business yet, but what you
[00:29:08] just said was was a lot of really impressive things. And right now we know REALTORS are in
[00:29:13] recruiting mode because the markets down, they're starting to look around, maybe see what other
[00:29:17] options exist. So if you're in the Nashville area, go to movementpropertygroup.com. You can
[00:29:22] learn more about Matt and his company and maybe be a good fit for them. Yeah, absolutely. Well,
[00:29:28] come on. I'm a huge coffee fan, so I'll buy you a cup of coffee in a time. So let me know.
[00:29:35] So speaking of being the market being having shifted, of course, from 2021, we noticed here,
[00:29:43] we're in Chicago, we noticed that we have about 700 some REALTORS at our company. And we had a
[00:29:49] a pretty good first three quarters of last year. And the final quarter was kind of where everything
[00:29:55] changed and fell apart. We're now, you know, doing about half of what we were doing
[00:30:00] prior a year ago, which again, to be under to be, you know, that seems like it makes sense based
[00:30:04] on what happened in the market, but certainly an uncomfortable place. And I'm pretty active with
[00:30:10] the REALTOR community here locally. And I talked to a lot of agents outside of our company. And
[00:30:14] there seems to be top agents seem to be like everything's going to be fine. Agents who are struggling
[00:30:19] or newer are feeling a little discouraged and down, I think right now and also isolated.
[00:30:25] And I, that was another reason why I want to add that back to the sort of commercial I was giving
[00:30:31] for for for your group, because I think you, you, you probably, you would be an amazing boss to work for.
[00:30:37] But I also think that if you feel alone right now in this industry and you're not getting that
[00:30:41] personalized attention, this would be another reason to maybe reach out because you seem like
[00:30:46] you're able to provide some guidance. So I think not on my team just have a cup of coffee. I'm all about it.
[00:30:50] I think that's important to talk to someone else. Yeah. So how are you keeping your agents motivated
[00:30:56] right now? Obviously the market has shifted. It's changed. It's not quite as as busy as it was,
[00:31:03] although we hope that that changes this later this year. So what are you telling your agents to keep
[00:31:09] them, you know, sort of on track? I mean, I come at this. I'm a very bullish person in this type of
[00:31:18] the market. This doesn't scare me at all. In fact, I'm really, I'm actually great with it.
[00:31:23] Me and one of the other partners, I have, we were both very Keller's top 100 agents. So we've
[00:31:27] spent a lot of time in the room with Gary Keller. If you don't know, Gary Keller is Teller Williams.
[00:31:31] Billionaire real estate. Billionaire real estate agent. But brilliant, brilliant, brilliant business man.
[00:31:36] And he has a really good pull some things. And he thinks outside of the box. And I, I always get a lot
[00:31:41] from those times with him. But he wrote a book called Shift. And he talks about shifting markets
[00:31:46] somehow. Basically, there's just as much opportunity to capitalize on business now as there was
[00:31:50] a year and a half ago. Like there's, it just is a different business. It's a different type of
[00:31:54] market. You're, you're looking at a different skill set, a different, you know, your day to day looks
[00:31:59] different. For our team, I, you know, Nashville's unique. I have to give that preface because Nashville
[00:32:06] is its own ecosystem anyway. It doesn't rise with the rest of the country. It doesn't fall. The rest
[00:32:10] of the country, and currently, Nashville's the number one market in this country to move to. And so,
[00:32:14] we're a little bit insulated from some of that. So, to be honest with you, we, we felt a little
[00:32:20] bit of a slow down in September and October. We were back up in November and December to our normal
[00:32:24] members. And we're, we're, you know, exceedingly beating those numbers this year. So I, I don't see,
[00:32:31] so that's also that's part of this. However, the conversation our rates and stuff is is, is right now,
[00:32:36] we have, and I think in any market, you're going to have a lot of real estate agents that exit the
[00:32:40] business, um, which for anybody that's staying in the business is fantastic because it just is
[00:32:44] awesome. Sure. Yeah. Take, right? Yes. So the people that are going to be able to stay in the
[00:32:48] business and watch all the people leaving and make sure you go call their friends and say, hey,
[00:32:52] I, do you have an agent because your, your previous agent may have left. And I would love to buy
[00:32:56] you coffee and take over and you take over that business and take that market share. So we're,
[00:33:02] really preoccupied with taking market share this year, as a lot of folks are leaving.
[00:33:05] Um, I think the conversation is all also, I try to somewhat control the narrative a little bit.
[00:33:13] Um, when the rates started going up and inflation started going up and things were kind of
[00:33:18] hitting down, there was a good half of the community builders, bankers, you know,
[00:33:23] allos and real estate agents that are the sky is falling. We're heading towards total economic
[00:33:27] collapse and they just spread all of this massive amounts of fear that the sky is falling.
[00:33:31] And what that does is that that that spews all of that to clients and buyers and sellers and
[00:33:36] they're like, well, I don't need to move in. I'm too terrified because everyone's saying the sky's
[00:33:40] falling. I try to be a little bit of a voice or reason in that and bring some data to support
[00:33:44] the other side of that and say, it's not falling. We're in this type of a shift and this is what it
[00:33:48] looks like. We've done it lots of times in the past. We'll do it again and we're fine. We're not on
[00:33:53] the bar of bread, break a global economic collapse. We're just not there. Um, I have, I can't tell you the
[00:33:59] might my daily conversation has been with people who are basing all of their fears on a 2008 meltdown.
[00:34:06] And I continually try to bring data to the table again and be the voice for reason in 2008 was not due
[00:34:11] to an economic recession. It was not due to, to, you know, massive inflation or any of this other
[00:34:17] stuff 2008 was due to wildly an ethical lending practices. Subprime lending.
[00:34:22] The mortgage fraud at the end of the day and it finally caught up with everybody and we had to
[00:34:26] pay for that. And so that's what 2008 was. This is not 2008. This is a typical market shift. And in
[00:34:32] six of the seven last of the previous typical market shifts properties is still appreciated.
[00:34:37] How's it still sell? And so I just am not. So I try to arm myself with as much data and facts as I
[00:34:44] can to bring those conversations to the table, bring a little bit of balance and reason to everybody.
[00:34:49] I have a few people in the market that are experts that I usually, I always say very, very
[00:34:54] finger on because they're always going to bring a lot of really good data to the table that is above
[00:34:59] and beyond my, like above my pay grade. But good data that I can then bring to my clients. Thanks to
[00:35:03] Hey, listen, here's some really, really great financial advisors, economic experts that are saying,
[00:35:08] this is what we're looking at. Here's what you can expect. Here's what this means for us.
[00:35:13] And then the second piece of that is then I pitch why I pitch in this season what that means for
[00:35:19] you. So while right now for Nashville, what that means across the board is that while yes,
[00:35:24] rates are higher and you will pay a little bit more. Sellers are giving mass, mass credits and
[00:35:31] mass discounts right now. So while you might pay a little, so I'll take that rate and I'll say,
[00:35:36] sure, we were at 3% last year. And we're at 8% now. The difference in that's going to cost you
[00:35:41] an extra $10,000 this year. However, the seller of this house that I'm selling right now that we
[00:35:47] just showed is willing to give you a $35,000 credit, which means that that would never have happened
[00:35:52] six months ago. Six months ago. We were eight months ago. No, we were. We were pricing above
[00:35:59] market value. Things were selling $100,000 higher than that with no appraisal zero concessions and
[00:36:05] zero, zero, moveability from a seller. So at the end of the day, you're foundations broken. Sorry,
[00:36:13] it's on your fix. Like at the end of there's nothing. And so I'm telling my, I'm telling my buyers
[00:36:17] right now, it's fantastic time to buy because the rates are going to go back down. You'll be able to
[00:36:21] refinance any year and you get a property for the actual market value with the $35,000 seller
[00:36:26] concession and they'll probably fix all the stuff that comes up on the repair proposal. Let's
[00:36:29] buy the house now refinance next year and you're going to be in a better situation in a year than
[00:36:34] you would have good if you bought eight months ago. Yeah, yeah, because number one, it was probably
[00:36:39] certainly overpriced because or most likely would have been overpriced due to multiple over.
[00:36:45] Yeah, and even though like I'm locked into a 3% rate and I need to, I need to make sure
[00:36:50] that I don't think of myself as well now I can never move because and I think, I think,
[00:36:55] I think REALTORS would do themselves a huge favor in really understanding the mentality of the
[00:37:02] 3% mortgage because most of the people who own a home refinance in the last several years or
[00:37:07] purchased a home at a low rate, those people are thinking I don't want to move because I don't
[00:37:13] want to lose that rate. You as a REALTOR, like you need to be armed with data and just education
[00:37:19] to say here's how it could work if you were to move and here's why it's not quite as ugly as it
[00:37:26] might appear. Well, and understand all of the other nuances that come into play. One of my favorite
[00:37:32] things that has worked so well is I have really fantastic partners. So I have four different
[00:37:38] lending partners that I refer to all the time. My primary lender guy is one of the top in the
[00:37:42] Southeast but I have local banks and a credit union and another banker that do really specific
[00:37:45] things. So I go to a lot of my sellers and I'm like, okay, let's do this. Let's turn you into a real
[00:37:51] state investor. Let's keep your 3% rate. Let's pull your money out on a HELOC. Let's go buy another
[00:37:56] property that you want to buy and this property is going to pay for that property and you're going
[00:37:59] to refinance the property and you're going to have two properties cash flowing, paying for you're
[00:38:02] going to live for free and there's so many of those opportunities right now to tell people about
[00:38:06] what it means to become a real estate investor. And now, yes, you have one property at 3% which you
[00:38:11] get to hold on to that rate but there's all of this other opportunity to still do what you want to
[00:38:15] do to move forward in life to get the next house to become an investor to build whatever it is.
[00:38:20] There's all those opportunities that you can do and some of that's being armed with the right
[00:38:23] tools and understanding what those tools are that you have your disposal which sit down. I do this
[00:38:28] probably on a two biweekly basis. I sit down with my lenders with my bankers and I say, tell me what
[00:38:33] you've got right now and all of them have really unique opportunities and unique products right now
[00:38:37] to meet the market demand. One of my lenders and this is great is offering basically they prepay
[00:38:43] for the refinance ultimately and so I'm offering so they're buying the property and they're getting a
[00:38:48] free refinance within the next two years. We're planning on rates being down in the fives this year.
[00:38:55] I think and probably for us next year and that's kind of iffy but that's probably where we're
[00:38:59] planning on. So at the end of the day, you can ultimately get your house now, get the seller credits
[00:39:04] to cover all the difference and then some and then you you literally have a zero-postry finance
[00:39:08] when the rates go. That's amazing. That is an important thing and that's just you staying in touch
[00:39:13] with your lenders going, hey guys, what do you got right now? Absolutely and then helping present
[00:39:17] that to my clients because they don't usually lenders are a little more data driven, they're a little
[00:39:21] bit more numbers so they're a little bit less personable so that it's maybe able to interpret that
[00:39:24] data and walk through it really slowly in general with my buyers or sellers and say here's some
[00:39:28] opportunities that we have. We've done a lot of rate buy downs, we've got three, two, one buy downs
[00:39:33] right now happening so rates are at seven, you buy down three percent for the first year, two
[00:39:37] percent for the second year, one percent for the third year and that's all part of something
[00:39:40] that seller pays for and then you refinance by the time that that goes back up and again you save
[00:39:46] yourself money. So at the end of the day, the rate doesn't have to be a scary thing, there's lots of
[00:39:49] ways around it. Having a house with a three percent rate doesn't need to lock you into the house
[00:39:54] for the rest of your life. There's lots of ways to still make the moves you need to move your house
[00:39:58] and one seller client, they would they call me actually the list their property because
[00:40:02] they have grown out of their property and they actually love their neighborhood, they love their
[00:40:06] kids school which they can walk to from their house, they brought other kids home to this house,
[00:40:10] they absolutely love this house and their dream would be to be able to renovate it, add a little
[00:40:14] bit of space to it, but they just can't afford it. And so I talked myself out of a job and I sat
[00:40:19] down with them and I said, hey, here's here's here's what I think. I think you take the $500,000
[00:40:24] equity you have in this house. I think you get that in a key lock and then I think we're going to go buy
[00:40:28] some investor properties that'll cashflow that you're going to take $150 of that and do the
[00:40:32] renovation and additions to your house. And these investment properties that you're doing are going
[00:40:36] to pay for that renovation and you're going to be at the same cash monthly cashflow that you are
[00:40:39] right now. On a short short, that's the that's the route we went. So I talked myself out of a listing
[00:40:43] but I talked myself into three investment purchases and they get to stay in their house, they get
[00:40:48] to do the addition and who are they telling everybody about? You've got to go talk to Matt, he has
[00:40:52] options you don't even know exists. So it's about arming yourself with the options and how to creatively
[00:40:56] get around people's problems and that starts with listening to people knowing their story, knowing
[00:41:00] what their pain points are. But then figuring out creative solutions to be able to get around those
[00:41:04] pain points and knowing the tools you have in your your back pocket and by way of lenders and banks
[00:41:09] and options for them to be able to do the things that they need to do. And that's this market. This
[00:41:14] is the perfect market for that. Perfect. Yeah, I could not agree more. I think what we're really
[00:41:19] talking about is education and in real. Real. Real. Realizing the marketing and branding, that's one
[00:41:25] part of your business but continuing education. I don't mean to the every two years thing that you
[00:41:29] have to do for your state your license. I mean, regular studying the market and also studying what
[00:41:35] other people are doing to pivot and compensate for some of the deficiencies in the market. You know,
[00:41:42] and it's really as I mean, this podcast was birthed out of me think, look, thinking of, you know,
[00:41:48] top REALTORS in the country going, I wonder how they did that. And then I said, I wonder if I asked
[00:41:51] them if they'd if they tell me on a podcast, there's really nothing in it for them other than at the
[00:41:57] time when I first started right, like no listeners. Now, now we have thankfully a lot of listeners.
[00:42:01] But back then I was like, I don't think anyone's going to want to do this because there's literally
[00:42:05] nothing in it for them. And sure enough, I was I think we got turned down once or twice out of
[00:42:10] hundreds of times. So it's one of these things where anybody could you can reach out to the top
[00:42:15] agents in your area. Not everyone's going to reply, but say, gosh, I really admire you. I admire
[00:42:20] what you do. I would love to take you to coffee and just get a better understanding. And you what
[00:42:25] you I think what you'll usually find is that they have more information than you have. And here's
[00:42:31] what I'll tell you. I'll tell you that if if someone turns you down for a coffee date like that
[00:42:36] at that type of a class, they're not actually a top agent in the area. They're a mid to high level
[00:42:41] agent. The mid high level agents tend to be like, no, my business, I do it. The top agents are like,
[00:42:46] yeah, let me help you. There's no secrets. All of us. We've been through this long enough that we
[00:42:51] know there's plenty of business for everybody. Let me sit down and help you figure out your business.
[00:42:55] Oh, and what does this relationship do for me as well? Because I can, you know, you never know
[00:42:58] who you're going to meet and what that's going to be too as well either. So yeah, it's a great
[00:43:02] thing because number one, you're not really bothering them if they don't want to go to coffee with you.
[00:43:07] They won't. But the ones that do are smart because they are going to think, well, maybe this person
[00:43:11] might join my team or this person might join my brokerage or maybe I can just be of service to
[00:43:16] this person and give them something. And then they'll have a positive feeling. You know, it's just
[00:43:20] top agents are generous in my experience. This whole podcast is for the most part.
[00:43:25] For the most part. Yeah, there's exceptions. Absolutely. Yeah. And, and you know, I mean, I think
[00:43:31] this is actually a really, I know we didn't get to as much of your story as I as I would have
[00:43:36] liked to. However, I think this episode in particular, we've done 400 and I don't know,
[00:43:41] 50 episodes or so. This is a really good episode. And I hope I, yes, because I think what we talk,
[00:43:48] what I think came through very well and very eloquently was how you think about the industry,
[00:43:54] how you think about managing your team, how you think about working with buyers and sellers,
[00:43:59] investors as well. It really just sort of your overall attitude as approach and strategy.
[00:44:04] I think came through really, really well. And if for nothing else, listening to Matt say, I am not
[00:44:10] worried about 2023. And you probably shouldn't be either, but you should be paying attention to
[00:44:16] what successful agents are doing in the area. This is, this is a great opportunity when times are
[00:44:22] slower to reach out to some of those agents and really get some of those, those coffee dates set
[00:44:27] up. And even, even if you, you just went on one of those a week, imagine if Matt, I mean,
[00:44:32] I'm just so funny, you'll appreciate this. But back when you were not a top producer and you were
[00:44:37] not, you know, running your own business, can you imagine the amount of information you would have
[00:44:42] got if just once a week you would have taken a top producer for a year to launch it,
[00:44:47] to, would have been incredible. Oh, for sure. Well, I tell people, I tell people on my team all the
[00:44:52] time, one of the things that I did do that I credit a lot of my success for is I probably took
[00:44:56] about 60 coffee dates a week. I would go to a coffee shop and I would sit there and I would
[00:45:01] introduce myself to everyone in the coffee shop. And I would do that multiple days,
[00:45:04] multiple times a day, every single day of the week, just because I want to meet people. And so,
[00:45:08] now, to your point, had I gone back and taken one of those days and actually met with other top
[00:45:12] producing agents, that probably would have been wildly valuable. But at the end of the day,
[00:45:16] meet people, meet everybody you meet because they've always got something to offer. Everyone has
[00:45:19] something to offer. Everyone has some piece of wisdom. Everyone has a story. And at the end of the
[00:45:23] day, there might be business for there for you there as well. And it always begins with this
[00:45:26] relational kind of organic level. But everyone's got something to offer in that space for sure too.
[00:45:31] So yeah, go to coffee dates with everybody. You can go to coffee dates left for sure.
[00:45:35] And I want to back up one second because what you just you also just said something that is very
[00:45:38] profound. And probably people's anxiety spiked when you said it because it is kind of a scary idea
[00:45:45] for a lot of us, which is you went you go to a coffee shop and you introduce yourself to all the
[00:45:50] patrons there. And which by the way, not an easy thing to do. Like we can, you know, we can pretend
[00:45:55] that it's easy. But for most of us, that's a very, very scary proposition because we're like,
[00:45:59] we don't want to bother people. We don't want people to yell at me. We don't want to be rejected,
[00:46:02] etc. But if you if you can get comfortable with the fact that approaching somebody and saying,
[00:46:08] I am always so impressed when I go to a party or when I go to any sort of social event.
[00:46:14] And somebody comes up to me who I don't know. And it's like, hi, I'm so and so. And they don't know me.
[00:46:19] It's not like they know me from something else. They just randomly come up. But I was with a friend
[00:46:24] of mine last night who we read an event for our local Chicago's our association of REALTORS.
[00:46:31] And and I asked her, I said, oh, Amy, I haven't seen you all night tonight. She goes, I'm walking around
[00:46:35] talking to people who are standing by themselves. And I was like, that's amazing because amazing.
[00:46:41] Amazing. Amazing. Amazing. Love that. And so the point is you guys can do this. And it's a good idea.
[00:46:47] Doesn't mean you have to pitch your services and your products. And you know, nobody really wants to
[00:46:51] be pitched in a coffee shop. Here's an idea. Here's an idea. And this is what I did. And I'll put it out
[00:46:55] there. I think it's I think it was one of the best moves I made is you have to spend money to make
[00:46:59] money, right? So spend a little bit of money. But I would go on every three or four times a week and
[00:47:05] go to a coffee shop. And I talked to the priest. Who know me because I'm in the coffee shop every day.
[00:47:09] And I'd say for the next two hours, I'm buying everyone's coffee and I'd give them my card and say,
[00:47:12] hold my card. And everyone that comes to the line, they'd say, hey, your coffee's covered by that guy sitting
[00:47:16] over there. They'd all come in or do some sales to me. I didn't have to go introduce myself to anyone
[00:47:20] anymore. They came in and introduced themselves to me. And we'd talk and I'd say, man, I just love
[00:47:23] my community and I love my neighborhood. I want to know the people in it. I want to serve my
[00:47:26] community well. I'll, by the way, I'm a real estate agent. Here's my business card. Let me know if I can help.
[00:47:30] That's huge. Yeah. Not that not that you you know, it's not easy not necessarily to always draw
[00:47:37] straight line to business. But any idea about how much business that might have generated for you.
[00:47:44] I'm seeing amount of business. It was a good for doing an investment. The ROI was very high for sure.
[00:47:53] Oh my gosh, I got to have you back on the show. This is incredible because
[00:47:57] let's, let's do it. Let's do it. All right. So I want everybody who lives in, who's a real turn
[00:48:01] the Nashville area, you got to reach out to Matt. Now, understand he's a busy guy and he will
[00:48:07] get back to you when he can. But if you are not getting this kind of attention from your team lead,
[00:48:11] you need to reach out. Property man, he's incredible. He's done an incredible job on the show.
[00:48:17] And I want to make sure anyone listening, you should reach out to him. Oh, and by the way,
[00:48:21] before before we end, I do have to ask you before I'll give your your plugs here in one sec.
[00:48:26] But who's your favorite pianist? Who are your favorite pianists? I'll give you my first two
[00:48:32] hour. I'll give you mine first. And I only have one. I mean, there's lots that I admire. The only
[00:48:37] ever really was to Bill Evans. I'm a Bill Evans guy. I was going to say Bill Evans is one of my
[00:48:42] tops. I love Bill Evans. He's just, I mean, he's essential though. I mean, he's kind of made, he made
[00:48:46] his Michael Jordan. Yeah. Right. He's the Michael Jackson of jazz pianists. He's amazing. So he's,
[00:48:51] yeah, Bill Evans is great. I will go probably a little bit old school. I'll go back to their
[00:48:54] romantic periods. They rock him on and off rock him on an off. So my favorite composer. And, uh,
[00:48:59] and just I think the hit, the brilliant brilliant composer always played with passion. You know,
[00:49:04] you have 10 fingers and he would write 12 notes at once. Like I know the amount of passion
[00:49:08] that came into his writing. And so yeah, he dropped on an off. What was the, what was the,
[00:49:12] the movie, the rock, mononoff movie shine? So everybody you need to see the movie shine. It is,
[00:49:20] well, it's, it's kind of a sad movie. It's very sad. They're actually, but, but it's somebody
[00:49:24] trying to attempt rock, mononoff second. Third, third, third, which is the hardest piano piece in the
[00:49:30] world of all time. Yeah. There's only several dozen people that have ever played a successful
[00:49:35] a one of which is my teacher, actually. So I grew up, I grew up with that and she played all the world.
[00:49:39] She taught it. Julia and she didn't go crazy as in the movie. No, I mean, everyone goes a little
[00:49:43] crazy when you get to that level. So she was a little eccentric, but she didn't lose it for sure.
[00:49:47] But, um, but yeah, it shines with David Healthcott. And it's about the, yeah, David Healthcott. Yes.
[00:49:52] Yes. Yeah. That was the story of David Healthcott. Yeah. Oh my gosh. Oh, right. Gosh, I could talk to
[00:49:56] you forever. Um, so for everyone, everyone listening, I want you guys to check out and also
[00:50:01] support Matt's music too. Um, I want everybody to go to movementpropertygroup.com. If you're a

But right before we were going alive, I was telling Matt, the last time I was in Nashville was for the eclipse. And I was like, Oh, were you there? And you were in Puerto Rico. And I was saying, it was really a cool thing because, and I don't know that most people knew this. I certainly didn't, was that because we were at Nashville, which was considered like a perfect latitude, longitudinal point to be able to see the eclipse, we were able to safely take our glasses off and stare directly at the eclipse only for a minute or so. But there, because we were at that one space, we were actually able to see it without glasses. And it really was, I honestly, I think it's the most beautiful thing I've ever seen. I love that. Aside from being in beautiful Nashville, which is also just such a dream place to I always fantasize if I was going to move Charleston or Nashville, maybe be my daughter. Anyway, enough about me. Let's talk about you. Thanks for. Thanks for coming on the show. And let's actually, I'd love to hear about how you got into real estate. I know you're a musician. So and still a musician. So I'd love to hear about, you know, how you had, you know, the path you had through a musician ship and also real estate and how you married the two. Yeah, how long do we have? I mean, a few hours, right? I mean, it's, it's, it's, it's kind of a crazy story. I, yes, I just said I'm a musician. I, I grew up music's kind of been my only most of my life. I started playing professionally. I was nine. And so I've never known anything else. And so what's school for music? I went to Nashville for music. And, and for all intents and purposes, I really made it in the music industry or started, you know, kind of my, my bustling music career and was on a good trajectory and moving forward really well. And met a girl as all of the stories start. Married said girl and in our, in our, shortly after we got married, actually, we had a family member that basically stole a lot of money from us left us with a pretty intense amount of debt. And long story short, we lost our house. We were homeless for year and a half. And, and I say homeless, my wife's corrected me many times on this. We weren't fully homeless. We had lots of friends that offered up their couch or a spot in a garage or, you know, their driveway for our car or whatever. So we had, we had lots of lots of people who stepped in and took care of us during that season, but we were unable to, we did not have our own space for a year and a half. And, um, living in the same school you were still performing during that time. I was. Yeah. Some music was still the primary at that time, which, you know, I made okay money in music, but not enough to recover loss like that. And this was, you know, pretty substantial. So we had, you know, still, an extraordinary hurdle to get over in order to even get us back to solvent and ground zero and pursuing a music career and a life as a musician is hard enough, let alone adding that to it. It just kind of became a non starter. And so I pivoted a, a buddy of mine at the time, worked as a mortgage lender. He's like, maybe you should get your real estate license and all send you a deal once a while and do the math and the money. As a musician, the money looked really great and feels like, man, I know a lot of people. If you are a musician, you've made it as a professional musician in a national tendency, you know how to network like nobody's business. And so I know people and I'm relational and I love diving into people in their stories. And so I could, hey, I owned a buyer's house. I can help them with that. And that's at least some money that I would not have had any other way. So I was, of course, working about five days and the way to do it really, yeah, just knock it out. Because I always, I always tell people who are taking their classes. I'm like, you're going to forget it anyway. You might as well forget it after the test. So do it as quick as possible. There's not a single thing in that class or in that education process that I've actually applied realistically in my career. And so anyway, sorry, state of Tennessee real estate exam, but it ended up just being something I could kind of blow through and then learn the practical side of it on the other side of it. But I just dove in and again, I tell people a time, you know, part of my success story is a fact and when you don't have another option, but for it to work, it has to work. And you figure out how to make it work. And so I got very, very determined, driven to figure out how to recover from this because the other side of this is that I really am passionate about music and I knew music was where I needed to be in my career path. And I don't have a long time to take my time recovering from this. I need to get to the other side of this and get back to music. And that really was my goal for the whole first part of my career. And then there's been some shifts and some additions in there, which I'm sure we'll get to. So ultimately for me, it was out of necessity that this kind of came up. Real estate was never on my on my purview. And it was just a mention. And what's amazing is I'm really grateful for that moment because real estate is such an incredible tool in vehicle as an agent, but also learning the investor side of it and how property ownership leads to wealth building and passive income. And there's so many pieces of real estate that I never knew. Super countercultural in my from my world, my parents, you know, people that had given me financial advice up to that point in my mid 20s. I had heard very polar opposite advice from when I started being in the real estate industry watching investors who were making a lot of money. I started weighing those two things and realizing that there's maybe another path here and a whole bunch of stuff that I didn't know before that could help me become a little bit more financially solvent and still have the freedom and capacity to pursue music and do that. I want to do that too. So anyway, that's how my real estate career started and how it kind of developed there. Wow, well, there is, I'd love to unpack some of that. So number one, when you were talking about, I know you've recovered since otherwise I wouldn't make any joke at all. But I was like, well, at least it was a family member. Right. Sure. If it can't be family stealing, I don't know. No, I mean, it's awful. Awful. It was, it was really heartbreaking and it was on top of a lot of other things. My wife and I, there's like the barnest statistics of the top 20 stressors and marriage experiences in a lifetime. And we hit 18 of them our first year of our marriage. And so I really was just a hellish hellish season for sure. And I can look back at that now. And there were actually a lot of beautiful moments in there. My wife might feel like we've been married for 40 years when in reality, we've only been married. It probably brought, brought you both a lot closer together because you had to be band together as a team and really, really figure life out when you were at this huge disadvantage. So in some ways, it again, not that there's that it's a good thing. It's not the ideal. But the result of the less than ideal is that we clung to each other for survival and we figured out him forward. And that doesn't mean by any stretch that it's been easy. And we've had an immense amount of hard in our marriage. Which I think marriage is supposed to be hard. Everything worth while is hard. Yeah. However, through a lot of counseling and a lot of therapy, which we're still going through and I'm too proponent of therapy, we are recovering from the trauma and we are still married and still trying to fight for something we believe in. So, but I do think that that early part of that definitely got us real real fast with each other. Got us real with ourselves real fast and I figured out what it looks like to believe in yourself when honestly no one else does or no one else can because there's nothing to believe in at the moment in that way. So you just kind of just charge forward. And again, when you have to do it, you don't have an option but to do it. You do it. You figured out. It is like that. It's that expression. What is it? Necessity is the mother of invention. Which is absolutely. It's like it's so interesting when because people will call me a lot who are in the process of getting their real estate license and they'll ask the the biggest question I think that people like me who are recruiters get from people who are entering the businesses. Well, I want a steady income. So I'm going to stay part time for now. And what do you think about that? And it's I always say, well, nobody can give you the right answer. I said, however, people will tell you that there's no way to do it part time and that full times really the only way. And while in theory, I think that probably is the right approach for most people. I have seen people do it part time, but the people that do it part time because they want that steady income from their pre you know, their current job. I understand that I get that. But I think what you're saying actually does tend to bring out the best of somebody when you cut off the the the lifeline and you're like, I'm just going to make this work. I'm going to figure it out like you guys were in that forced to situation. It does actually seem to get make people more resilient and they're able to sort of find resources when they have that lifeline. It's harder. I think to access that drive when you're trying to do two things at once. Not to say that you can't be done. I've had people on the show who started part time for years and was able to then be eventually become a top producer. But I think that I think that extends the journey by doing it. I was going to say my argument therapy is that those years that they weren't a top producer would have been erased. Had they just gone full in? Can I parallel it to music permanent? I like I said, I've done music whole life. So that really is my background. I went to school for music in Los Angeles. And my first day, freshman 101 class, this was a commercial commercial music business class. I was a commercial music major with the piano performance emphasis. And first day, music business 101, there's 68 freshmen in this class. And the professor comes in kind of blows through the doors. Doesn't really even argue to himself. Just kind of sets a briefcase down and says, how many of you guys have a plan B? And my immediate thing is, well, this is where I get the lecture about how I need to have a plan B because music's so unstable and you've got to have a backup plan blah blah. And I have a vendetta against plan B's and that has never been me. So I didn't raise my hand really ready to fight this like you don't have a plan B when you're a musician. And oddly enough, 38 kids rose raised their hands with their plan B's and he just moved from the class. Because if you have a plan B, you will end up taking it. You probably shouldn't end up taking it. And honestly, you're wasting my time and yours. So there's the door. And obviously it's a little nicer than that. But at the end of the day, he made the comment after you left that the people make it in music are the ones who will make it or die trying. And those are your options. There's no option. There's no other plan B because music is notorious, a notoriously difficult career to enter into and it's going to take everything you've got to get there. I would say that's true with entrepreneurship, with leadership, with ownership, with any company, any of that, that's the reality. Because if you are not willing to literally risk it all and put 100% of it online, then that doesn't happen. And it's not going to happen until you're ready to do that. And so trying to weigh some sort of safety net of a steady income or whatever and then still trying to start something else. Even if you're one of the lucky few who kind of balanced that and get to some place where that happens, it's going to take an extraordinarily, it's going to take a much longer period of time to get there. Then if you just are 100%, you're going to get it down, you're going to want, which is why entrepreneurs, clinical entrepreneurs, you know, Elon Musk's and Steve Jobs and these big folks, clinically, they do something they start it, they get it running and they move on to the next thing and fire people to run the thing for them. Because at the end of the day, the folks that are able to do that are the ones that are just 100% and they're going to establish something and they're going to move on to the next thing. And so I think that for me getting thrown into that, already having my background in music, my wife and I are both notorious risk takers as it is. So we're not, we have no risk of version anyway. But there was just, that was an easy transition press to be right in that, right in that mix and just go for it. It reminds me speaking of like a musical metaphor that I think speaks to what you were just saying. I don't remember who the musician was who did this. I don't know. It was a violinist and I don't know if it's a pro-menor. I don't think it was him. But if somebody else, some some super famous violinist considered best in the world at, you know, 23 years ago, whatever. Anyway, so they was at a party, somebody was at a party in New York ran into this person and was like, oh my gosh, I'm such a huge fan. I wish I could play the violin like you or I think it was violin. Maybe it was cello, the Gio-Yoma or something. Whatever. It doesn't matter. Somebody super famous. And he goes, no, I'm totally misremembering who the person was, but doesn't matter because what the person said was so, so the someone went up, I wish I could play like you. I, oh no, he said, I give my life to play like you. That's what the fan said. And he goes, no, you wouldn't because he goes, yeah, exactly. He goes, no, you wouldn't because I did. And he goes, you don't, you, you aren't. And it wasn't trying to be mean. He was like, he was, you don't understand. Like, this is all I do. This is what I do. And I, you know, I, and he's like, if you're willing to give up everything else, then yes, you could probably play like me. And that's, and that's not to say that you can't have balance in your life. Obviously, everyone we should strive for that. And having, you know, personal and professional, you know, balance with, with our activities, that being said, it is like one of those things. You know, even if it doesn't work, I still think the lessons learned from putting in a solid, you know, attempt will then lead you to the next thing, even if that failure is never, it shouldn't be a negative. No, it's just simply a stepping stone. It's a, hey, I learned how not to do something when they go do it differently and do it again. And I think you said balance. And I'm definitely a component of balance. I am anti-workaholic for sure. And you have, I think you need to really align your priorities and figure out what takes priority in your life. And of course, for me, my family is a huge priority, my kids. And there's nothing real, state or music, actually, that will ever take precedence over them at the end of the day. But, but in that, I think that you, I still think that the things that you're going to put yourself to, you're going to find more success in those things that you're willing to put yourself 100% into those things and be fully present and fully there and 100% committed. And taking the safe route almost always keeps you in the safe zone, which is, which is some sort of a, a mediocre, not a mediocre and a bad way, the mediocre mid-level average zone. The people that get above that are the ones that are willing to kind of take the risks to get there. So I think risk is the key component to this, no matter where you are. And that doesn't mean you don't prioritize things that are important. It just means that you're willing to jump into those things, those other things that you do full force at first. I think too there's there's an aspect. I'm curious to get your thoughts on this. There's an aspect of getting comfortable with failure. And I don't mean failure. Obviously, we're talking about feedback, you know, things that aren't the ideal outcome that you're shooting for, you, you know, just doesn't work. I call it failure, but I don't put a connotation on that. That's a bad thing. I just call it all that didn't work. Well, it's called did things that didn't work. I'll say that. It's oh, I think the most successful people I know are ones who are like, well, that's just like you said, it didn't work. I learned from it. I'm going to try something else. And it's a really simple idea, but it's very difficult for a lot of us to sort of get comfortable with that discomfort of like, oh, I really went for this and it didn't turn out. So now I have to, like you were saying, with your business and you've pivoted multiple times, you've had to pivot obviously with your living situation. And that's, you know, that's obviously a very serious and difficult, stressful thing. But this idea of being able to just be present for some of these these feelings and then go, oh, okay, I'm sad that something didn't work out in the way that I wanted. But I'm going to really take it as feedback and then just keep going forward and moving. I think is, you know, into a different direction possibly. But I think it's important to get comfortable with, you know, things not working out the way that you would anticipate them. And so that way you can just, you know, I mean, probably 80% of the as a marketing guy, 80% of the things I do don't provide the results I'm really looking for. But yeah, but I think it's a number. It's a number. It's a number. It's a first day. And at the end of the day, I think you have, I think I think far too many people give far too much time and emotional energy to a failed attempt. Yeah. I think that those things come and I'll be on that stings. Okay, back to the drawing board. It should be a pretty quick roll off to keep going forward and move forward. And I think if you devote a lot of time and energy, you lose any momentum you did have. And then you're always starting from square one or square zero. Whereas if you can roll that off, you can still capitalize in some of the momentum that keep moving with that. Definitely. And I think that becomes. And again, it doesn't matter who you are. You asked anybody in the world who's found any measure of success and any discipline, they're going to say that their path to that success has 80% of the time been, oh, I failed and I kept going. That's the point. That's how it works. And again, I think part of me is a musician comes at that such a natural thing because I was in front of juries and on stage and getting judged for my playing since I was nine. So I there was always that, oh, that wasn't great. Here's how you do it better. Oh, great. I'll go learn to do it better and blow you away next time. I mean, there's just never that was never a problem for me. I have a colleague. I won't mention his name. I say, colleague, because he's I'm not a huge huge fan per se of some of the thing, but I'll have to say, he went bankrupt to millionaire three times and to get to his multi million dollar world right now, he was bankrupt three times back to millionaire. And so he did the bankrupt two millionaire, flow three different times. It's third fourth time theoretically got to millionaire and have stayed there. But I appreciate that story because at the end of the day, that's just kind of what it is. It's a number scheme. You're going to fail. It's going to happen. Fail big win big as an investor. I buy a lot of we do a lot of investments and I I chant champion a lot of clients to be investors in the market. And I always say two out of 10 times, I'm going to break even maybe make a little bit of money five out of 10 times. I'm going to make some money and three out of 10 times. I'm going to make a lot. And so then overall, in the course of 10 deals, I've made a lot of money. And I find that a lot of my investor friends tend to, I mean, I have one investor right now. He's been wanting to invest in Nashville for four years and hasn't pulled the trigger on anything yet because he's too scared to lose any money. And I'm like, bro, you could have bought anything four years ago. And you would have made money at this point. Like it didn't matter. Like, so I think that at some point, you just got to go for it and man, you win something loose on. But as long as you grow and learn and win more than you lose, you're good. Well, that and I think there's really even something deeper about the example you gave about the gentleman that that went broken millionaire, you know, three to three different times is you could take all that person's money away tomorrow. It's already happened to him several times. And he's built and he's built it back up. It's so he he is not worried about, well, he's probably worried about failure in the sense of he doesn't want to lose what he's built. But it's happened to him. And he's like, oh, I know how to do this. I know how to build up from nothing. You know how to build from nothing. You have done that. And that is, I mean, that in and of itself, it's not something that can easily be taught. It sort of has to be lived. And exactly. And there's no shortcut through it. It just is exactly that. But what it does is there's a ton of freedom in that. And I wish I could communicate that freedom to someone that hasn't experienced it because that would allow them to launch without having to go through it. But I don't not tell you sure that's actually possible. But that is a huge part of where my story is, is the fact that I'm actually not scared of losing it all except in their dumb that. And so I lose it all. I'll figure out how to figure it out again. Like I just I'm not scared of that. Therefore, it allows me a lot of freedom to go take those risks and dive in had burst into things that I believe in. And, and, you know, so I think that's a huge part of it. I think you're absolutely right. If you can get past the fear of losing it all and understanding there's there's just freedom and safety in the fact that you're going to be able to keep going. There's no the worst case scenario is not really worst case right now. Like it opens it opens you up to keep going forward. You know, yeah. Well, at least in this country, we have a lot of opportunity and we're very fortunate to to live in a country where there is a lot of economic opportunity for people that are disadvantaged. Not that it's easy. Of course, it is not and we should have that but the in compassion for people who don't, you know, have have a lot of resources. But, but it is amazing. I'm always so amazed that people who just do it and you're right. It's seen I've had a lot of them on my show over the years. You're not the first person that has told me they slept in their car. And, and when I, I mean, it's in and it's like they just go, well, I just didn't have another option. So that I just put everything I had into it. And, and it's, it's that it's that gift of desperation. It really is in some ways a gift. Not a fun ride, but it is, it is a ride that'll get you there. If, if you can stay in the car the whole time. I think it usually proves something about yourself to yourself. Yeah. When you're in that desperation place and you get out of it, you look back yourself and you're like, Oh, I don't, I can do that. I'm not scared of my own ability to do that anymore. And I think people, I just was having conversation with one of my, one of my, uh, girl that works for me yesterday. And we were just talking about how sometimes she, she's second guess herself. She's wildly skilled. She's wildly talented, but she doesn't necessarily believe in herself a lot. And then hinders her from really stepping into some of that and knowing her value as she presents herself. And I was like, you're wildly valuable. You have a ton of skills. You know, you're, you're, you have to believe in yourself 100%. Even if no one else does. And the gift of desperation, I like how you said that oftentimes gives someone the ability to believe in themselves. Because you know, and also is going to do it at that point. You have to believe in yourself to get there. So, and I want to, I want to honor you for something that you just said, because I think what you just said really highlights why you're, I would assume a very effective and, um, uh, boss and mentor because if something you just said that I wonder how many of our audience members have heard this from their managing broker where you, you sat somebody down, you know, this, this woman who works with you, who is maybe not feeling super confident or struggling with, you know, her own capabilities. And you're like, oh, no, you're super talented. You're super skilled. Like you can do this. I, I don't think that's all that common. I think there's a lot of training that goes on at brokerages. Um, I mean, we certainly do it at our brokerage. There's lots of training and there's lots of here the skills, here are the activities. But to be, but to, but to actually say to somebody, you're super talented, you have this. I actually think that's pretty rare. And I want to honor you for saying that because I bet that was exactly what she wanted or needed to hear in that moment. And for you to, to, to give her what she needed, um, I think that is a very special thing that you say. I think it's very vulnerable to say that. And, and I think that probably meant a lot to her. And I, I would encourage anyone who's listening who has, who is a managing broker who runs a team, who has people right now. We know it's a tough time. You know, rates are up inventories down. People, brokers are, real tours are struggling. So this is a great time to make sure the people that are struggling on your team do know how valuable they are to you and how skilled they are. It might just be maybe they're feeling down, but you could maybe lift them. And I, I think, I just want to honor you for doing that. Um, that's, that's, that's, that seems so obvious to me. Um, yeah, I suspect. But, um, but that being said, I've watched a lot of team leaders bulldoze their, their teams before and, and have the, the looming and boss mentality and let me squish you down until you submit and do it. And I just think that that's not ever working. Um, I take leadership actually as a lowest position on my team. So we usually invert the whole workshop and I'm at the bottom and my teams at the top because at the end of the day, they, um, at the end of the day, I'm not going to be able to do what I do without them at this point. And I think one of the things that you have to understand about people in general, and maybe this is where my, this is probably where I'm, I know that I'm a little bit unique in this aspect because I get told that from my partners on a regular basis, even, but I, um, I am wildly empathetic. I'm very much a relational person. So that's what I do. I dive into relationship and I will, I will give my, I will give myself under the bus to ensure that someone else thrives. Um, and, uh, in stepping in with people listening to their story, hearing where they're at, hearing who they are, I would challenge anybody trying to go to team or any brokers managing individuals leaders, anybody leading anybody else, understand that the people and do not only are wildly talented and really skilled set actually and really skilled their skill set, their talent, their value is something you could never bring to the table. Yep. At the end of the day, I have a skill set that I bring to the table that's very valuable. I don't doubt that at all. However, the other people that I work with have a skill set that they'd bring to the table that I do not have. And I need to know that they do something better than me. And that's okay. My team members under me do things better than I do. That's okay. That's not, that's the point. That's why teams work at the end of the day is because other people do things better than you do. If everyone did everything as good as me and I just happen to be the one of the driver's seat, just a matter of time before someone jumps in the driver's seat and takes over from me. Well, normally I wait till the very end to say this, but I want to say it now while I think the iron is still hot. Basically, I think what you've demonstrated to a lot of our audiences, boy, I wish I had a managing broker or a team lead like that. So if anyone is in the national area, I might as well do it now because I honestly think you spoke from the heart. I think I think it was a very unique sort of value proposition in a sense and in talking about how you relate to your team members and the support you provide to them. If anyone out there is working in the national area, and maybe you feel like you're not getting that kind of support or encouragement or empathy or help from your existing, I guess they're called managing brokers in Tennessee. I'm guessing, but whoever, team lead, whatever, the person in charge, if you're not getting that, you know, reach out to Matt, you can go to movementpropertygroup.com. He would love to learn more about you. See if you might be a good fit for his, his company. I know we haven't talked much about the business yet, but what you just said was was a lot of really impressive things. And right now we know REALTORS are in recruiting mode because the markets down, they're starting to look around, maybe see what other options exist. So if you're in the Nashville area, go to movementpropertygroup.com. You can learn more about Matt and his company and maybe be a good fit for them. Yeah, absolutely. Well, come on. I'm a huge coffee fan, so I'll buy you a cup of coffee in a time. So let me know. So speaking of being the market being having shifted, of course, from 2021, we noticed here, we're in Chicago, we noticed that we have about 700 some REALTORS at our company. And we had a a pretty good first three quarters of last year. And the final quarter was kind of where everything changed and fell apart. We're now, you know, doing about half of what we were doing prior a year ago, which again, to be under to be, you know, that seems like it makes sense based on what happened in the market, but certainly an uncomfortable place. And I'm pretty active with the REALTOR community here locally. And I talked to a lot of agents outside of our company. And there seems to be top agents seem to be like everything's going to be fine. Agents who are struggling or newer are feeling a little discouraged and down, I think right now and also isolated. And I, that was another reason why I want to add that back to the sort of commercial I was giving for for for your group, because I think you, you, you probably, you would be an amazing boss to work for. But I also think that if you feel alone right now in this industry and you're not getting that personalized attention, this would be another reason to maybe reach out because you seem like you're able to provide some guidance. So I think not on my team just have a cup of coffee. I'm all about it. I think that's important to talk to someone else. Yeah. So how are you keeping your agents motivated right now? Obviously the market has shifted. It's changed. It's not quite as as busy as it was, although we hope that that changes this later this year. So what are you telling your agents to keep them, you know, sort of on track? I mean, I come at this. I'm a very bullish person in this type of the market. This doesn't scare me at all. In fact, I'm really, I'm actually great with it. Me and one of the other partners, I have, we were both very Keller's top 100 agents. So we've spent a lot of time in the room with Gary Keller. If you don't know, Gary Keller is Teller Williams. Billionaire real estate. Billionaire real estate agent. But brilliant, brilliant, brilliant business man. And he has a really good pull some things. And he thinks outside of the box. And I, I always get a lot from those times with him. But he wrote a book called Shift. And he talks about shifting markets somehow. Basically, there's just as much opportunity to capitalize on business now as there was a year and a half ago. Like there's, it just is a different business. It's a different type of market. You're, you're looking at a different skill set, a different, you know, your day to day looks different. For our team, I, you know, Nashville's unique. I have to give that preface because Nashville is its own ecosystem anyway. It doesn't rise with the rest of the country. It doesn't fall. The rest of the country, and currently, Nashville's the number one market in this country to move to. And so, we're a little bit insulated from some of that. So, to be honest with you, we, we felt a little bit of a slow down in September and October. We were back up in November and December to our normal members. And we're, we're, you know, exceedingly beating those numbers this year. So I, I don't see, so that's also that's part of this. However, the conversation our rates and stuff is is, is right now, we have, and I think in any market, you're going to have a lot of real estate agents that exit the business, um, which for anybody that's staying in the business is fantastic because it just is awesome. Sure. Yeah. Take, right? Yes. So the people that are going to be able to stay in the business and watch all the people leaving and make sure you go call their friends and say, hey, I, do you have an agent because your, your previous agent may have left. And I would love to buy you coffee and take over and you take over that business and take that market share. So we're, really preoccupied with taking market share this year, as a lot of folks are leaving. Um, I think the conversation is all also, I try to somewhat control the narrative a little bit. Um, when the rates started going up and inflation started going up and things were kind of hitting down, there was a good half of the community builders, bankers, you know, allos and real estate agents that are the sky is falling. We're heading towards total economic collapse and they just spread all of this massive amounts of fear that the sky is falling. And what that does is that that that spews all of that to clients and buyers and sellers and they're like, well, I don't need to move in. I'm too terrified because everyone's saying the sky's falling. I try to be a little bit of a voice or reason in that and bring some data to support the other side of that and say, it's not falling. We're in this type of a shift and this is what it looks like. We've done it lots of times in the past. We'll do it again and we're fine. We're not on the bar of bread, break a global economic collapse. We're just not there. Um, I have, I can't tell you the might my daily conversation has been with people who are basing all of their fears on a 2008 meltdown. And I continually try to bring data to the table again and be the voice for reason in 2008 was not due to an economic recession. It was not due to, to, you know, massive inflation or any of this other stuff 2008 was due to wildly an ethical lending practices. Subprime lending. The mortgage fraud at the end of the day and it finally caught up with everybody and we had to pay for that. And so that's what 2008 was. This is not 2008. This is a typical market shift. And in six of the seven last of the previous typical market shifts properties is still appreciated. How's it still sell? And so I just am not. So I try to arm myself with as much data and facts as I can to bring those conversations to the table, bring a little bit of balance and reason to everybody. I have a few people in the market that are experts that I usually, I always say very, very finger on because they're always going to bring a lot of really good data to the table that is above and beyond my, like above my pay grade. But good data that I can then bring to my clients. Thanks to Hey, listen, here's some really, really great financial advisors, economic experts that are saying, this is what we're looking at. Here's what you can expect. Here's what this means for us. And then the second piece of that is then I pitch why I pitch in this season what that means for you. So while right now for Nashville, what that means across the board is that while yes, rates are higher and you will pay a little bit more. Sellers are giving mass, mass credits and mass discounts right now. So while you might pay a little, so I'll take that rate and I'll say, sure, we were at 3% last year. And we're at 8% now. The difference in that's going to cost you an extra $10,000 this year. However, the seller of this house that I'm selling right now that we just showed is willing to give you a $35,000 credit, which means that that would never have happened six months ago. Six months ago. We were eight months ago. No, we were. We were pricing above market value. Things were selling $100,000 higher than that with no appraisal zero concessions and zero, zero, moveability from a seller. So at the end of the day, you're foundations broken. Sorry, it's on your fix. Like at the end of there's nothing. And so I'm telling my, I'm telling my buyers right now, it's fantastic time to buy because the rates are going to go back down. You'll be able to refinance any year and you get a property for the actual market value with the $35,000 seller concession and they'll probably fix all the stuff that comes up on the repair proposal. Let's buy the house now refinance next year and you're going to be in a better situation in a year than you would have good if you bought eight months ago. Yeah, yeah, because number one, it was probably certainly overpriced because or most likely would have been overpriced due to multiple over. Yeah, and even though like I'm locked into a 3% rate and I need to, I need to make sure that I don't think of myself as well now I can never move because and I think, I think, I think REALTORS would do themselves a huge favor in really understanding the mentality of the 3% mortgage because most of the people who own a home refinance in the last several years or purchased a home at a low rate, those people are thinking I don't want to move because I don't want to lose that rate. You as a REALTOR, like you need to be armed with data and just education to say here's how it could work if you were to move and here's why it's not quite as ugly as it might appear. Well, and understand all of the other nuances that come into play. One of my favorite things that has worked so well is I have really fantastic partners. So I have four different lending partners that I refer to all the time. My primary lender guy is one of the top in the Southeast but I have local banks and a credit union and another banker that do really specific things. So I go to a lot of my sellers and I'm like, okay, let's do this. Let's turn you into a real state investor. Let's keep your 3% rate. Let's pull your money out on a HELOC. Let's go buy another property that you want to buy and this property is going to pay for that property and you're going to refinance the property and you're going to have two properties cash flowing, paying for you're going to live for free and there's so many of those opportunities right now to tell people about what it means to become a real estate investor. And now, yes, you have one property at 3% which you get to hold on to that rate but there's all of this other opportunity to still do what you want to do to move forward in life to get the next house to become an investor to build whatever it is. There's all those opportunities that you can do and some of that's being armed with the right tools and understanding what those tools are that you have your disposal which sit down. I do this probably on a two biweekly basis. I sit down with my lenders with my bankers and I say, tell me what you've got right now and all of them have really unique opportunities and unique products right now to meet the market demand. One of my lenders and this is great is offering basically they prepay for the refinance ultimately and so I'm offering so they're buying the property and they're getting a free refinance within the next two years. We're planning on rates being down in the fives this year. I think and probably for us next year and that's kind of iffy but that's probably where we're planning on. So at the end of the day, you can ultimately get your house now, get the seller credits to cover all the difference and then some and then you you literally have a zero-postry finance when the rates go. That's amazing. That is an important thing and that's just you staying in touch with your lenders going, hey guys, what do you got right now? Absolutely and then helping present that to my clients because they don't usually lenders are a little more data driven, they're a little bit more numbers so they're a little bit less personable so that it's maybe able to interpret that data and walk through it really slowly in general with my buyers or sellers and say here's some opportunities that we have. We've done a lot of rate buy downs, we've got three, two, one buy downs right now happening so rates are at seven, you buy down three percent for the first year, two percent for the second year, one percent for the third year and that's all part of something that seller pays for and then you refinance by the time that that goes back up and again you save yourself money. So at the end of the day, the rate doesn't have to be a scary thing, there's lots of ways around it. Having a house with a three percent rate doesn't need to lock you into the house for the rest of your life. There's lots of ways to still make the moves you need to move your house and one seller client, they would they call me actually the list their property because they have grown out of their property and they actually love their neighborhood, they love their kids school which they can walk to from their house, they brought other kids home to this house, they absolutely love this house and their dream would be to be able to renovate it, add a little bit of space to it, but they just can't afford it. And so I talked myself out of a job and I sat down with them and I said, hey, here's here's here's what I think. I think you take the $500,000 equity you have in this house. I think you get that in a key lock and then I think we're going to go buy some investor properties that'll cashflow that you're going to take $150 of that and do the renovation and additions to your house. And these investment properties that you're doing are going to pay for that renovation and you're going to be at the same cash monthly cashflow that you are right now. On a short short, that's the that's the route we went. So I talked myself out of a listing but I talked myself into three investment purchases and they get to stay in their house, they get to do the addition and who are they telling everybody about? You've got to go talk to Matt, he has options you don't even know exists. So it's about arming yourself with the options and how to creatively get around people's problems and that starts with listening to people knowing their story, knowing what their pain points are. But then figuring out creative solutions to be able to get around those pain points and knowing the tools you have in your your back pocket and by way of lenders and banks and options for them to be able to do the things that they need to do. And that's this market. This is the perfect market for that. Perfect. Yeah, I could not agree more. I think what we're really talking about is education and in real. Real. Real. Realizing the marketing and branding, that's one part of your business but continuing education. I don't mean to the every two years thing that you have to do for your state your license. I mean, regular studying the market and also studying what other people are doing to pivot and compensate for some of the deficiencies in the market. You know, and it's really as I mean, this podcast was birthed out of me think, look, thinking of, you know, top REALTORS in the country going, I wonder how they did that. And then I said, I wonder if I asked them if they'd if they tell me on a podcast, there's really nothing in it for them other than at the time when I first started right, like no listeners. Now, now we have thankfully a lot of listeners. But back then I was like, I don't think anyone's going to want to do this because there's literally nothing in it for them. And sure enough, I was I think we got turned down once or twice out of hundreds of times. So it's one of these things where anybody could you can reach out to the top agents in your area. Not everyone's going to reply, but say, gosh, I really admire you. I admire what you do. I would love to take you to coffee and just get a better understanding. And you what you I think what you'll usually find is that they have more information than you have. And here's what I'll tell you. I'll tell you that if if someone turns you down for a coffee date like that at that type of a class, they're not actually a top agent in the area. They're a mid to high level agent. The mid high level agents tend to be like, no, my business, I do it. The top agents are like, yeah, let me help you. There's no secrets. All of us. We've been through this long enough that we know there's plenty of business for everybody. Let me sit down and help you figure out your business. Oh, and what does this relationship do for me as well? Because I can, you know, you never know who you're going to meet and what that's going to be too as well either. So yeah, it's a great thing because number one, you're not really bothering them if they don't want to go to coffee with you. They won't. But the ones that do are smart because they are going to think, well, maybe this person might join my team or this person might join my brokerage or maybe I can just be of service to this person and give them something. And then they'll have a positive feeling. You know, it's just top agents are generous in my experience. This whole podcast is for the most part. For the most part. Yeah, there's exceptions. Absolutely. Yeah. And, and you know, I mean, I think this is actually a really, I know we didn't get to as much of your story as I as I would have liked to. However, I think this episode in particular, we've done 400 and I don't know, 50 episodes or so. This is a really good episode. And I hope I, yes, because I think what we talk, what I think came through very well and very eloquently was how you think about the industry, how you think about managing your team, how you think about working with buyers and sellers, investors as well. It really just sort of your overall attitude as approach and strategy. I think came through really, really well. And if for nothing else, listening to Matt say, I am not worried about 2023. And you probably shouldn't be either, but you should be paying attention to what successful agents are doing in the area. This is, this is a great opportunity when times are slower to reach out to some of those agents and really get some of those, those coffee dates set up. And even, even if you, you just went on one of those a week, imagine if Matt, I mean, I'm just so funny, you'll appreciate this. But back when you were not a top producer and you were not, you know, running your own business, can you imagine the amount of information you would have got if just once a week you would have taken a top producer for a year to launch it, to, would have been incredible. Oh, for sure. Well, I tell people, I tell people on my team all the time, one of the things that I did do that I credit a lot of my success for is I probably took about 60 coffee dates a week. I would go to a coffee shop and I would sit there and I would introduce myself to everyone in the coffee shop. And I would do that multiple days, multiple times a day, every single day of the week, just because I want to meet people. And so, now, to your point, had I gone back and taken one of those days and actually met with other top producing agents, that probably would have been wildly valuable. But at the end of the day, meet people, meet everybody you meet because they've always got something to offer. Everyone has something to offer. Everyone has some piece of wisdom. Everyone has a story. And at the end of the day, there might be business for there for you there as well. And it always begins with this relational kind of organic level. But everyone's got something to offer in that space for sure too. So yeah, go to coffee dates with everybody. You can go to coffee dates left for sure. And I want to back up one second because what you just you also just said something that is very profound. And probably people's anxiety spiked when you said it because it is kind of a scary idea for a lot of us, which is you went you go to a coffee shop and you introduce yourself to all the patrons there. And which by the way, not an easy thing to do. Like we can, you know, we can pretend that it's easy. But for most of us, that's a very, very scary proposition because we're like, we don't want to bother people. We don't want people to yell at me. We don't want to be rejected, etc. But if you if you can get comfortable with the fact that approaching somebody and saying, I am always so impressed when I go to a party or when I go to any sort of social event. And somebody comes up to me who I don't know. And it's like, hi, I'm so and so. And they don't know me. It's not like they know me from something else. They just randomly come up. But I was with a friend of mine last night who we read an event for our local Chicago's our association of REALTORS. And and I asked her, I said, oh, Amy, I haven't seen you all night tonight. She goes, I'm walking around talking to people who are standing by themselves. And I was like, that's amazing because amazing. Amazing. Amazing. Amazing. Love that. And so the point is you guys can do this. And it's a good idea. Doesn't mean you have to pitch your services and your products. And you know, nobody really wants to be pitched in a coffee shop. Here's an idea. Here's an idea. And this is what I did. And I'll put it out there. I think it's I think it was one of the best moves I made is you have to spend money to make money, right? So spend a little bit of money. But I would go on every three or four times a week and go to a coffee shop. And I talked to the priest. Who know me because I'm in the coffee shop every day. And I'd say for the next two hours, I'm buying everyone's coffee and I'd give them my card and say, hold my card. And everyone that comes to the line, they'd say, hey, your coffee's covered by that guy sitting over there. They'd all come in or do some sales to me. I didn't have to go introduce myself to anyone anymore. They came in and introduced themselves to me. And we'd talk and I'd say, man, I just love my community and I love my neighborhood. I want to know the people in it. I want to serve my community well. I'll, by the way, I'm a real estate agent. Here's my business card. Let me know if I can help. That's huge. Yeah. Not that not that you you know, it's not easy not necessarily to always draw straight line to business. But any idea about how much business that might have generated for you. I'm seeing amount of business. It was a good for doing an investment. The ROI was very high for sure. Oh my gosh, I got to have you back on the show. This is incredible because let's, let's do it. Let's do it. All right. So I want everybody who lives in, who's a real turn the Nashville area, you got to reach out to Matt. Now, understand he's a busy guy and he will get back to you when he can. But if you are not getting this kind of attention from your team lead, you need to reach out. Property man, he's incredible. He's done an incredible job on the show. And I want to make sure anyone listening, you should reach out to him. Oh, and by the way, before before we end, I do have to ask you before I'll give your your plugs here in one sec. But who's your favorite pianist? Who are your favorite pianists? I'll give you my first two hour. I'll give you mine first. And I only have one. I mean, there's lots that I admire. The only ever really was to Bill Evans. I'm a Bill Evans guy. I was going to say Bill Evans is one of my tops. I love Bill Evans. He's just, I mean, he's essential though. I mean, he's kind of made, he made his Michael Jordan. Yeah. Right. He's the Michael Jackson of jazz pianists. He's amazing. So he's, yeah, Bill Evans is great. I will go probably a little bit old school. I'll go back to their romantic periods. They rock him on and off rock him on an off. So my favorite composer. And, uh, and just I think the hit, the brilliant brilliant composer always played with passion. You know, you have 10 fingers and he would write 12 notes at once. Like I know the amount of passion that came into his writing. And so yeah, he dropped on an off. What was the, what was the, the movie, the rock, mononoff movie shine? So everybody you need to see the movie shine. It is, well, it's, it's kind of a sad movie. It's very sad. They're actually, but, but it's somebody trying to attempt rock, mononoff second. Third, third, third, which is the hardest piano piece in the world of all time. Yeah. There's only several dozen people that have ever played a successful a one of which is my teacher, actually. So I grew up, I grew up with that and she played all the world. She taught it. Julia and she didn't go crazy as in the movie. No, I mean, everyone goes a little crazy when you get to that level. So she was a little eccentric, but she didn't lose it for sure. But, um, but yeah, it shines with David Healthcott. And it's about the, yeah, David Healthcott. Yes. Yes. Yeah. That was the story of David Healthcott. Yeah. Oh my gosh. Oh, right. Gosh, I could talk to you forever.
