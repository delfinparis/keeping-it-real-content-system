[00:02:03] Today's episode is brought to you by Corded.io.
[00:02:06] Are you looking for agents to join your brokerage or team?
[00:02:10] Now, as a real estate recruiter, I can tell you the answer is always yes.
[00:02:14] But most agents aren't looking to move right now.
[00:02:17] So how do you know who to contact?
[00:02:19] Well, what if I were to tell you there's a recruiting and retention tool powered by artificial intelligence
[00:02:24] that shows you exactly which agents in your local market are looking to leave their brokerage right now
[00:02:30] and which agents at your own firm are also looking to leave you?
[00:02:35] Now, I've been recruiting REALTORS for 15 years and I've hired over 2000 agents.
[00:02:40] I can tell you with no exaggeration, this is the tool I've been waiting for.
[00:02:44] Corded.io looks for trends across dozens of variables for each agent in your market
[00:02:49] and shows you which agents they believe are likely to move.
[00:02:53] Not only does it do that, but Corded.io went and visited my recruiting website
[00:02:57] and read everything I offer.
[00:02:59] So now when I'm recruiting, Corded.io tells me exactly what to say based on that agent's needs
[00:03:05] and what my brokerage can offer.
[00:03:07] It even writes emails for me.
[00:03:09] I've never seen anything like it and I use it every single day.
[00:03:13] Now, if you are looking to grow your brokerage, Corded.io is the best tool out there.
[00:03:19] Visit Corded.io to schedule a demo again.
[00:03:22] That's Corded.io and now, onto the show.

[00:06:40] It'll take you right there.
[00:06:41] Trisha, welcome to the show.
[00:06:42] Thank you so much for having me.
[00:06:45] I am so excited to talk to you.
[00:06:47] I haven't done this show for seven years.
[00:06:50] I think maybe I've had one or two home staging episodes over that entire time.
[00:06:55] I can't even remember how many years it's been since the last one.
[00:06:58] So this is super exciting because it's a part of the business that I feel doesn't really get it's due.
[00:07:04] I don't think it's talked about enough.
[00:07:07] It's funny because the home staging experts will tell REALTORS,
[00:07:11] like, no, you'll actually sell this for more money.
[00:07:14] This is actually a money-
[00:07:15] Absolutely.
[00:07:16] ...that positive situation.
[00:07:18] And I think a lot of agents just maybe they're not exposed to it,
[00:07:21] or they don't think about it, or they think their clients won't pay for it.
[00:07:24] So today we're going to make the case on why virtually every home should at least have
[00:07:29] some sort of staging opportunity.
[00:07:31] So let's start with you.
[00:07:33] How did you get into home staging?
[00:07:35] Well, you've always had an interest in it.
[00:07:37] For some from the first time I was looking at homes to buy my first home.
[00:07:42] And then when I sold my first home and when I sold my second home,
[00:07:46] and I just really wanted to present a good product.
[00:07:50] I used to sell insurance a long time ago, and we learned all about the need behind the need,
[00:07:55] or the why behind the why, and why are people needing this,
[00:07:58] or why do we need to show them that they need that?
[00:08:00] And so I kind of integrated that into the home staging process
[00:08:04] when long many, many, many years ago.
[00:08:07] And then once I was able to kind of decide,
[00:08:13] well, you know, when people are coming in,
[00:08:14] they want to really connect with this home.
[00:08:16] They want to spend time with their family and friends here.
[00:08:19] They want to have Christmas here, or send their daughter off to prom here,
[00:08:23] and things like that.
[00:08:24] And so really trying to create this emotional connection
[00:08:26] of having breakfast in the breakfast nook,
[00:08:29] or dinner parties at the dinner table,
[00:08:30] or breakfast in bed, and things like that.
[00:08:33] And so I started to do little things like that many, many years ago.
[00:08:37] And then before the internet, you know, a long time ago.
[00:08:40] Oh, I remember.
[00:08:42] Yeah, way long time ago before the internet.
[00:08:44] And then once I, I mean, I tried to, I delved into so much,
[00:08:49] you know, the library and all the places you could find any kind of just more
[00:08:52] sales of information about the home buying process or home staging,
[00:08:56] which back then 20 years ago, there wasn't really a whole lot of information about it.
[00:09:01] And since then, you know, about 10 years ago when I started this company,
[00:09:05] I really was just helping a neighbor get her house sold.
[00:09:09] We live in a really nice area with a really, really good school district,
[00:09:13] and homes typically sell very, very quickly.
[00:09:16] And hers was very low price, and it just sat there and she kept lowering the price,
[00:09:23] and lowering the price.
[00:09:24] And I think one thing that is so important with home staging is
[00:09:28] people actually telling the truth.
[00:09:30] And you can tell the truth in love, which is kind of where we came up with lovely homes.
[00:09:34] I think, you know, sometimes sellers get so desperate and they just want people to tell them
[00:09:39] either what's wrong with their home and why it's not selling.
[00:09:41] And I think people are so afraid to hurt their feelings that they, you know,
[00:09:45] they don't want to tell them that it has an odor or they don't want to tell them that it's dirty
[00:09:49] or they don't want to tell them things like that.
[00:09:51] And I feel like at some, you know, they get to a point where they're so desperate to
[00:09:56] really know why it isn't selling.
[00:09:59] And so I think that's, we speak the truth in love.
[00:10:02] So we do come at it from a way that we want to definitely tell you, you know,
[00:10:06] things that are going to make a difference.
[00:10:08] And so that's kind of what I had to do with my neighbor.
[00:10:10] I walked into her formal living room and there was a pool table in her living room.
[00:10:14] And I was like, you, you know, you walk right in the front door and there's a beautiful fireplace
[00:10:20] and all this stuff.
[00:10:20] And there was a pool table.
[00:10:22] And I was just like, are you a professional pool player?
[00:10:26] And she's like,
[00:10:26] because that would be the only good reason to have a
[00:10:29] 
[00:10:29] That would be it.
[00:10:29] Like if your livelihood came from playing pool and she's like, oh, no, I hate that thing.
[00:10:35] You know, and I'm like, then why in the world would you have that right inside your front door?
[00:10:40] And anyway, so that kind of, we just, I went through her house and she didn't have a dining room
[00:10:44] table.
[00:10:45] And I'm like, this is where young families live.
[00:10:48] You know, you're in a, you know, first time home buying price point of a home and people need
[00:10:53] to sit down and eat dinner with their kids, you know, and so just a whole assembly of things.
[00:10:58] But anyway, it had been on the market for several months and had sold and they'd reduced the price
[00:11:02] of lunch.
[00:11:03] And I went in and moved things around and took stuff down and created a dining room and did some
[00:11:08] things like that.
[00:11:09] And she ended up getting multiple offers when her REALTOR took new pictures and put it back online.
[00:11:14] And so then I was not a home stater.
[00:11:17] I was a stay-at-home mom.
[00:11:19] And then that REALTOR said, I have another house.
[00:11:22] I'd really like you to take a look at.
[00:11:24] And I was like, oh, no, no, I don't do this.
[00:11:27] You know, this isn't my thing.
[00:11:28] I just really understand what was wrong.
[00:11:30] And she's like, please calm.
[00:11:32] I will pay you money.
[00:11:33] And then I thought, well, I guess I could do this.
[00:11:36] I took my little baby with me and a way we went.
[00:11:38] And he's now having his 11th birthday here in a couple days.
[00:11:42] And so yeah, we, but anyway, I had just learned and written down
[00:11:47] so many things about why we would really,
[00:11:50] why the emotional connection is so important.
[00:11:53] And just all these different strategies that have come up with over the years.
[00:11:56] So, yeah, that's how I got into it.
[00:11:59] And we should also mention, I'd like to say this.
[00:12:02] I want to say this upfront because it's a really important distinction between you
[00:12:06] and other local home stages.
[00:12:08] You are located in Kansas and for all of our audience that goes,
[00:12:11] well, I don't practice real estate in Kansas.
[00:12:13] Don't worry because we have Trisha on because she has a consulting,
[00:12:17] a home staging consulting practice as well.
[00:12:20] She's the only person I know in the whole industry that does this.
[00:12:23] So she can actually help you no matter where you are or where the property is.
[00:12:27] So I wanted to make sure that that's that's something.
[00:12:30] And you can learn about that at lovelyhomes.com, of course.
[00:12:34] Let's make the case.
[00:12:36] Well, actually, let's let me be the the REALTOR who doesn't want to home stage at home.
[00:12:43] I'll give you probably a reason you hear constantly, you know,
[00:12:46] often it's too expensive and or either I, the REALTOR doesn't want,
[00:12:52] I don't want to pay for it and or I don't know how to pitch it to my client
[00:12:57] to get them to pay for it.
[00:12:59] So this comes up a lot.
[00:13:00] I'm sure.
[00:13:01] So what would you say to an agent who says it's just too expensive?
[00:13:05] I mean, I feel like the the first thing I would say is when you are even considering
[00:13:11] home staging, I feel like it's important to approach it with asking home
[00:13:16] seizures or looking for a home seizure in your area or even one online
[00:13:19] and seeing what their approach to it is because I feel like you can work in any price point as a
[00:13:25] home seizure.
[00:13:26] Here in Kansas, we do vacant home staging.
[00:13:29] We also do occupied home staging.
[00:13:31] We approach those totally different.
[00:13:34] We I feel like the budget really concerns with there's so many things that are free.
[00:13:40] Like cleaning is free.
[00:13:42] I mean, unless you aren't able or don't have elbow grease to put into it.
[00:13:46] So I feel like there's that.
[00:13:47] I feel like, you know, opening blinds and taking down old curtains and things like that is free.
[00:13:52] I feel like, you know, turning on the lights that are already in your home is free.
[00:13:57] I feel like and then the other things that are so cost effective, like,
[00:14:01] fresh, neutral paint and things like that, you get back 125% of what it costs to do it
[00:14:07] in the price of the home.
[00:14:08] So I know the national association of REALTORS have done so much research and have so many
[00:14:15] statistics on home staging and they have a return on investment of 300% for home staging.
[00:14:21] So every one dollar that you spend, you get three dollars back.
[00:14:25] So I feel like it's it is an investment because it does cost a little bit money,
[00:14:30] but I always tell people it costs way less than a price reduction does.
[00:14:33] So I feel like being able to put a little bit up front, it also just the impact of it for REALTORS.
[00:14:41] I mean, I feel like it makes sure of houses sell faster, which in turn is good for you in the long run.
[00:14:47] It gives you a perceived an increased perceived value on the home and then also on your business
[00:14:51] as a REALTOR. I feel like it increases your professional image, just making you look like you know
[00:14:56] more about what you're doing. Even if you're not the one teaching them how to stage it, like because
[00:15:02] you have a professional that does that, just like in your role at X of having painters or having,
[00:15:07] you know, a handyman or an electrician or things like that. Also having a really good home
[00:15:12] stageer in your back pocket is just makes you look like a professional REALTOR. Your first impressions
[00:15:18] on your homes are always better. You have less days on market. The biggest thing I think a lot of
[00:15:24] people, we spent a lot of time on trying to minimize the negotiation obstacles at the end of the
[00:15:28] process like once you have sold the house and because you've taken the extra step on, you know,
[00:15:34] making sure all, you know, the air filters have been cleaned and the gutters are good and you've
[00:15:39] done these checklists and, you know, points on our, like we have a checklist that we hand them that
[00:15:45] they can make sure all these things have been taken care of before they get to the inspections
[00:15:49] and things like that that can slow things down at the end. So I do feel like it's, you know, it does
[00:15:55] cost a little bit as an investment but definitely pays in dividends, you know, with so much higher
[00:16:00] price, you know, a higher sales price in the end and those types of things. And then to answer
[00:16:05] your other question about, you know, finding a home stageer, I know we talked a little bit about
[00:16:10] this but we interviewed so many REALTORS here in our town and we were struggling a little bit just
[00:16:17] to kind of get the information out and why staging was important because of those things that you've
[00:16:21] just mentioned. And we put together a magazine that has all of those questions answered. I feel like
[00:16:28] for women, they walk into the home and have this real emotional connection and men are like, let me
[00:16:33] look at the windows and let me look at the, you know, the H back and stuff like that. And so men really
[00:16:39] struggle a lot more than women with home staging and why it's important. And so in our REALTORS guidebook
[00:16:45] to home staging, we put in statistics because numbers talk to men a lot more than they do to women
[00:16:51] typically. They talk to me both ways but I feel like in our guidebook it has, you know, statistics
[00:16:58] on why this is a good investment to make. And then of course there's pretty pictures of why it
[00:17:03] actually gives that first impression. So, you know, in today's day and age we talked about being
[00:17:09] getting started in this before the internet. But since the internet has come along, you know,
[00:17:14] your very first piece of marketing is your pictures online that people are seeing. And so really
[00:17:20] making those stand out as being, you know, a very tidy, well-maintained bright light and neutral
[00:17:28] home are the things that are going to appeal to buyers right away. Yeah. And, you know, I also,
[00:17:33] so by the way, to get that guide, it's lovelyhomes.com forward slash free. So we'll have a link to that
[00:17:39] in the show notes. Download this guide. It has all the stats. It tells you how to overcome objections
[00:17:44] and just gives you a lot of good information on makes the case for why home staging is so important.
[00:17:49] And I was thinking because you have this consulting opportunity, you know, for people all over
[00:17:54] the world, I was thinking, you know, you were mentioning is as becoming a real estate professional.
[00:18:00] One of the ways you could differentiate yourself is really getting knowledgeable about why home staging
[00:18:05] is so significant. And by the way, I've entered all I do on this show is interview the top 1% of
[00:18:10] REALTORS across the country. And they all do home staging. Like literally they all do it. It's
[00:18:14] it's rare. If I meet the only people that don't do it are people that have their own stock. And
[00:18:20] they just like, you know, so if you eventually get to a certain size of REALTOR, you might just be
[00:18:25] buying your own stuff and you're staging it yourself. But everyone else uses home, they're, you know,
[00:18:28] some sort of home stage or but I was thinking was you said something, you know, this idea that you're
[00:18:33] a consultant is really interesting because what I think I would want to do if I were a practicing agent
[00:18:39] is I would want to go into a home and say, I also want to take a look and give you some home staging
[00:18:45] ideas and go around and take notes and take videos. And then I would come back and hire you to go
[00:18:51] over that with me because then you would say, okay, DJ, you're going to tell them do this, this,
[00:18:55] this, and this. I would pay you a fee to do that because then I get to go back and be the hero
[00:19:00] anyway. And then I get to go and say, okay, this is what we need to do. And, you know, then, you
[00:19:06] can make the case for, for, you know, how it's a good investment and all of that. But I think that
[00:19:11] would be an amazing thing. Instead of hiring a local home stage, which by the way, great option to
[00:19:15] and sometimes you'll need to do that if you need to rent furniture and things like that. But just to
[00:19:20] go in and do the like, hey, I'm a REALTOR, I know what I'm talking about, you know, go in, take
[00:19:25] video. I'm going to come back to you with some ideas and, you know, talk to Trisha in between
[00:19:29] and she will tell you what to do. I think that in and of itself is an unbelievably smart thing for
[00:19:36] an agent to do. Absolutely. And I think it can help too. Like I was mentioning earlier, we're going
[00:19:41] to be coaching a workshop on like all of these different things that need to happen during and how
[00:19:46] to kind of progress through the home for staging it and getting it ready. And I think that, um,
[00:19:53] being able to have someone to, you know, look to or to, you know, even a resource to work off of,
[00:19:59] I think is very, is very, very important. And I think being able to just have that confidence that
[00:20:04] you know, looking at the home, what needs to be done next is also a valuable tool as well. And
[00:20:10] does make you out to be the professional, which I think, you know, you're in a lot of homes and
[00:20:14] you're doing that. So, um, knowing what to look for is definitely a good thing. Yeah, I just think
[00:20:20] that's so cool. If you go to a listing presentation and say, hey, one of the things I do for my clients
[00:20:25] that is a bit unique is I am going to tell you exactly how to stage this property. And I have a,
[00:20:30] you know, a team of people that I consult with to make sure and I'm going to come back to you with
[00:20:34] all these ideas and trishes of the team. And I mean, that is an incredible amount of value, um, to
[00:20:41] provide. And I want to talk about why home staging is so important, um, just aesthetically. So,
[00:20:47] obviously, you know, there's a lot of stats that will tell us why it's a good return on investment.
[00:20:52] And that's all great. But I also just think, you know, we talk about aesthetics. Instagram is
[00:20:57] nothing but a perfect aesthetics, right? Like it's essentially, uh, for us to make our lives and
[00:21:03] everything look a little bit shinier and cleaner than they really are more beautiful than they are.
[00:21:07] And that's no exception with, with, uh, with homes, right? And so we certainly see, you know,
[00:21:13] images of homes that are poorly staged or aren't staged at all. But we haven't expect, I think,
[00:21:19] as consumers of social media, we have an expectation that a home actually looks like in person that
[00:21:27] looks like what we see on Instagram for, you know, home after home after home. And even though
[00:21:32] that's probably an unfair thing to put on a homeowner, it is the reality in which we live in.
[00:21:38] And you might as well play with, in, in, with the cards were dealt because the expectation is
[00:21:43] going to be that everything looks perfect. And home staging gets you as close to that as possible.
[00:21:49] And I'm curious your thoughts on this. Yes. I mean, gone are the days of just having to hide
[00:21:53] the kitty litter. That's for sure. You know, like, we have surpassed that by a mile. And I feel like,
[00:22:00] um, I do feel like it's important that we like look at it as, you know, a, as a marketing tool,
[00:22:08] as a marketing piece. You have this object that we're wanting to sell and we have to feature it in
[00:22:12] its best light. And so I feel like the staging is going to be, um, really trying instead,
[00:22:19] besides just decorating, I mean, I think people kind of get those two confused. When I go into a
[00:22:24] home, that mean the first thing I say is how we live is totally different than how we stage. So,
[00:22:30] for example, I was helping a family get their dining room ready to sell or with that's the part of
[00:22:38] the tour we were on in the home. And I said that, you know, that film on the window is awful. You
[00:22:46] sit in this chair and eat dinner. The sun hits you right in the eye. And I was like, that sounds
[00:22:52] magical. Let's rip that nasty stuff down because we want so much of that sun to come into this room.
[00:22:58] And you know, when they sit down and have dinner in here, they're going to have to deal with that. But
[00:23:02] for now, we want all the light that we can to come into this room. So I think that, um, preparing the
[00:23:08] home for sale is definitely different than how we live. And honestly, on Instagram, I mean, nobody
[00:23:13] really lives like that anyway. All the mess is on the other side of the camera. But we don't
[00:23:17] think about that when we're looking at this beautiful picture. So I feel like that's kind of the,
[00:23:22] you know, we're trying to prepare this thing to go to market. And we want it to look. It's very,
[00:23:26] very best. We want to maximize the features that are there. If there's a fireplace or a view or
[00:23:32] a beautiful chef kitchen, kitchen, we're always trying to make those things elevate those things and
[00:23:37] make those even better. And then if there is something like a like flaws, we always want to try to
[00:23:41] minimize those. So if you don't have enough storage, I mean, let's just let that be our little secret.
[00:23:46] And we'll take as much stuff as we have inside of your cabinets and inside of your closets and
[00:23:51] things like that and pack those away to move and then let the buyers see how much base you actually
[00:23:57] have, you know, there is all this space here or things like that. So I definitely think it is, um,
[00:24:03] you know, presenting this, you know, magical thing that someone can connect with visually and then
[00:24:09] connect with emotionally and then ultimately purchase for a higher price than the one next store.
[00:24:15] That's our goal. Yeah. It's, you know, this just idea of clutter is is really great if if that's
[00:24:23] where how you like to live with certain, I don't mean, you know, tremendous clutter, but just having
[00:24:27] things out on, you know, that are permanent sort of things that sit out on counters because they're
[00:24:32] keepsakes or whatever they may be, they're important, you know, emotionally to you. Get them out of
[00:24:36] there for the photos, right? We want to see everybody wants clean lines. We don't want to see the
[00:24:42] toaster oven sitting out on the, you know, put that put that in the closet. But I would love to hear,
[00:24:48] I'd love to go just just one little tip per room, if possible, or rather a mistake that people make per room
[00:24:56] would be great as well. So, you know, when, because you must see just a ton of listings and most listings
[00:25:02] are not staged, right? And you probably are like, how, you know, this is, but again, you don't know what
[00:25:08] you don't know. So this is how a lot of audience. So let's, let's think about, we'll start with the,
[00:25:13] we'll start with the primary bedroom. Sure. I was going to say, let's start at the curb. That's
[00:25:17] normally what I, let's start at the curb. Okay, start at the front like our approach. We kind of
[00:25:22] check that out. I think a lot, the number one thing people often miss is their front porch. And
[00:25:27] when I say their front porch, I mean like they're the tightiness of the front porch, especially in our
[00:25:32] area, a lot of people enter the home through the garage. And so they rarely are on their front porch.
[00:25:37] And so, you know, I always tell them, you know, the week leading up to your house, you know,
[00:25:43] the photos and stuff being taken, come back out here to your front porch and check it for like
[00:25:47] cobwebs and spiderwebs and, you know, all that kind of stuff that can creep up pretty quickly here,
[00:25:53] especially and, you know, sweeping off your front porch when people are coming to tour your home,
[00:25:58] they're typically coming from another house with the agent. And so they'll be on the front porch
[00:26:02] with them while they're waiting for the MLS key to open. And so they're out there, you know, for maybe
[00:26:07] 20 to 30 seconds standing on your front porch and just looking. And so I always tell people, you
[00:26:12] know, just revisit your front porch before people come or before your photos are taken. So that's one
[00:26:17] thing I think is, um, and maybe even ask a few friends to come and say, I need you to take off that
[00:26:24] take off your hat that we're friends and I need you to put on your buyer hat.
[00:26:28] Yes. Imagine you're driving up to my property. What don't you like from the outside?
[00:26:32] Right. You know, I think a lot of people have overgrowth. I mean, there's so many things I could
[00:26:38] list, but that typically is the number like one of the things that people miss is their front porch
[00:26:42] and just having, you know, a fresh dorma is eight dollars at Walmart. I mean, just get one that
[00:26:47] says, welcome, no colors, no streamers, no frilly things, just welcome and a nice fresh dorma
[00:26:53] and make sure everything is clean. And I think that that really speaks a lot to buyers. So
[00:26:58] walking into the home, then like in your entryway, that kind of thing, I think entryways can vary,
[00:27:04] you know, how large they are or small they are if they're the table or room for any of that kind of
[00:27:09] stuff. But one thing I tell people to do is to remove anything that says you don't have enough
[00:27:13] storage. So that would be like a hall tree or an extra thing of hooks and things like that just
[00:27:19] says we don't have enough storage in our storage closet. That's great. I never would have thought of
[00:27:24] that, but you're absolutely right. Yeah. So that one or the other one would be like in the entry
[00:27:29] closet that you do have if it's full, completely full, that's one of the very first doors that people
[00:27:34] open when they come into tour house is going to be that entry closet. And so I always tell people
[00:27:39] to keep that, you know, deep down size your coat collection and your coat closet. One of my tips
[00:27:45] is to store it in luggage that you aren't using right now because it's, you know, used to having
[00:27:49] clothing and things like that. It's got wheels. It's easy to move. So store your out of season
[00:27:52] coats or things that you're not using a lot. And then try to keep that floor clean on your
[00:27:57] entryway closet because it makes the entryway feel a little bit larger. And we all care about one
[00:28:03] thing with closets is how much space there are. And you can't tell it's really the only thing we
[00:28:07] care about with closets is how big they are. So and having an empty floor in the closet makes the
[00:28:13] closet feel twice as large. Oh, that's a great tip empty floor. So would you recommend just
[00:28:18] completely emptying out a hall or an entryway closet? I mean, if you're, if it's a vacant home,
[00:28:24] obviously it's going to be empty. If you're living there in a summertime, you know, maybe you can
[00:28:29] have just a few things in there. Otherwise, it might seem weird. But I feel like, you know, one coat per
[00:28:34] person in your home is probably just going to be enough all the excess. I just, you know, you
[00:28:40] shouldn't have 50 coffee mugs in your kitchen and you shouldn't have 50 coats in your closet. So
[00:28:46] all right. So getting through the entryway, what are what do we have tackle next? Let's tackle,
[00:28:51] usually dining rooms are pretty close by. I think so my biggest thing on the dining room is people
[00:28:56] always have the shades or there's a really heavy drapery in there. And so I always try to get people
[00:29:01] to let natural light in making sure that all of the light bulbs in the chandelier are the same
[00:29:06] color. So the same Kelvin temperature and depending on if your home is really gray or really brown,
[00:29:12] that's kind of where we would choose a different colored light bulb there. But I feel like
[00:29:17] just making sure all the light bulbs are the same color to start off with is a really big factor
[00:29:22] that can show up and just look kind of tacky and pictures. So we just want to make sure those
[00:29:26] light bulbs are the same color. A lot of times I encourage people to set a dining room table very
[00:29:31] minimally. It just makes it really trigger emotional connection with fires. So yeah, that would be my
[00:29:38] main for the dining room is the light is a really big deal. All right, where are we going next?
[00:29:44] Let's travel to the living room. I feel like a lot of the gatherings and family time are going to
[00:29:51] be happening in there. And the same thing with making sure that the you know a lot of times with
[00:29:56] blinds, a lot of people have blinds in there and they'll just want to turn them open.
[00:30:00] And honestly, people don't ever usually open their blinds, which I think is so strange. But
[00:30:04] opening the blinds and actually pulling the blinds up so that you can see the full window and
[00:30:09] let the full light in and make sure your furniture, if you do have oversized furniture that you remove
[00:30:14] some of it. So you don't have wall to wall furniture. And then really highlighting the features.
[00:30:20] If you have a fireplace, maybe flinks some chairs on either side. If your view is what is the
[00:30:26] best thing, make sure that you have a walk. You don't push a couch right up next to the window.
[00:30:31] So people can't walk next to the window. So really trying to highlight whatever your feature is and
[00:30:35] make that even better. And what about even just like removing a big giant TV that's not mounted to a
[00:30:43] wall or you know, obviously if it's mounted, that's a bigger challenge. But you know, if you have
[00:30:47] like a free standing TV that makes the room look smaller, I suspect there's times where like get
[00:30:52] that out of there, put it in a closet and you can always put it back. Absolutely. You can't always
[00:30:58] put it back. And I think, you know, when we do vacant staging, people are like, oh, are you going
[00:31:02] to hang a TV in this room? And I'm like, you know, TV's aren't that pretty. If you think about it,
[00:31:06] nobody wants to see a TV. Nobody wants to see a TV. I mean, unless it's in some type of a theater room
[00:31:11] or a basement, something or another. I mean, I feel like that. But I mean, a really nice piece of
[00:31:16] large, chastel art is always going to have a better connection with people than a TV. So yeah.
[00:31:23] All right. So that's living room. Let's go to kitchen. Yes, the kitchen. I tell you what, you know,
[00:31:29] kitchen's common all shapes and sizes and colors. But I feel like they all have the same function in
[00:31:35] mind that this is where we're going to be, you know, preparing our food and that kind of a thing.
[00:31:40] So when I think of that, I try to tell people to spend the most time cleaning their kitchen,
[00:31:45] cleaning the inside of their appliances, the outside of their appliances, and organizing their
[00:31:52] kitchen, people open pantry doors, people open your cabinetry, they open your silverware drawer,
[00:31:57] all of that's connected. And so I think when people see a very tidy, clean and organized kitchen,
[00:32:04] it really shows that you have maintained your home properly. Yeah, you know, psychologically,
[00:32:10] it's going to tell these buyers that you have changed your air filter every three months and that
[00:32:16] if a leak has happened, you've taken care of that promptly because you are a clean, tidy,
[00:32:21] and organized person. And so I feel like that's a very important thing, especially in the kitchen,
[00:32:26] to really drive home. I have some friends who have this beautiful home in a blowing rock. I believe
[00:32:40] in the kitchen. So when people know that this is the main thing, it's going to tell people and both of
[00:32:41] these guys are absolute design nerds. And in their entire kitchen, there is not one thing out,
[00:32:49] there is not one appliance out. There is literally, it is just clean. And it's, and when you walk
[00:32:56] into, so to to your point, when you walk in and see it, it blows you away because no one's home looks
[00:33:01] like that, except for these two guys. And, and I mean, it looks like straight out of well,
[00:33:06] they're clearly don't live there kind of thing, but it's so beautifully done that you think,
[00:33:11] wow, these guys are on top of stuff. Like they're organized, they have their shit together.
[00:33:16] You know, and it just makes the police look like you're right. It sort of makes you think more
[00:33:21] highly of the of the place itself. And that's this is something anyone can do really.
[00:33:26] Oh, absolutely. I mean, that doesn't it just is, you know, it is what it is. It is taking
[00:33:31] 50 coffee mugs down to maybe six. And it is, you know, getting rid of all the excess so that you
[00:33:36] have room in your current kitchen to be able to store things that you do use daily, but inside
[00:33:41] of a cabinet space. And so I think that's one of the biggest things if it were just to pick one
[00:33:47] thing for the room would be to have it, you know, clean, tidy and organized. And just because it says
[00:33:51] so much about that, I mean, people know when you are when you're buying a pre-owned home,
[00:33:57] you know that someone has lived there. Obviously, their stuff is there. But it's I always try to relate
[00:34:02] that to people about when you go stay in an Airbnb or when you go stay in a hotel, you know that
[00:34:09] other people have stayed there. You just don't want it to feel like that. You don't want to see
[00:34:13] dirty towels on the floor when you come into a hotel. You don't want to see a bed unmade when you
[00:34:18] go into an Airbnb. You want it to feel very clean. Like you're the first person to come there and
[00:34:23] stay there. It makes you feel like that it's a place that you could live. So even though they know
[00:34:29] you're moving out before they buy the home, they just wanted to feel like a very clean place.
[00:34:35] And I just was thinking, well, I want to make this point or get your take on this point because
[00:34:41] and it's not just about staging it for the photos because that's part one. And then part two is
[00:34:47] making sure it looks like that when the person walks in, which again, that's a big ask. We understand
[00:34:52] that people need to live where they live and they yes, they're going to be a little inconvenience
[00:34:56] maybe. And there's some other stuff's not going to be where they want it to be. But it's important
[00:35:01] that when they walk in that, you know, the kitchen in the photo, and this is the problem with virtual
[00:35:06] staging. So I'm going to say virtual staging has its place and it could be great. But the
[00:35:11] challenge is if the home, if the kitchen doesn't look like what's in the pictures, whether it's
[00:35:15] virtually staged or professionally staged and then the person just puts it back to normal, there's
[00:35:20] going to be a huge disconnect there. And it's going to be like, oh, it's almost going to feel like
[00:35:25] the photos are no longer real. Like the photos. Almost like a beaten switch kind of into, I feel like
[00:35:31] as well. And I, you know, I try to really convey that if all these things are done, and you know,
[00:35:39] even if it's done right before pictures and then pictures are taken in two days later, your house
[00:35:43] is put on the market and between the time the pictures are taken, you take a little weekend get away.
[00:35:47] I feel like if all things are done properly and the home is priced at the right price, which is
[00:35:52] due to the REALTOR and agreeing on the price to put it up. And the pictures are professional.
[00:35:58] And everything has been marketed the way it should be. It really should just take three by our
[00:36:03] statistics show that there's three buyers that come into the house and at least one of them puts
[00:36:07] an offer in. So for us, that's how we look at it is maybe if you do everything right and everything
[00:36:13] gets done and it's, you know, all of that happens. You only have to live with it like that for the
[00:36:18] weekend. If we can get, you know, through this weekend and everything is price right, market right,
[00:36:24] all that kind of stuff stays right and everything looks like as it should, then hopefully you don't
[00:36:29] have to do a very long. Well, I don't want you to give away all of your secrets, but I know.
[00:36:36] And I would, I would, I want to hold because I want people to contact you as well. And I want
[00:36:41] this sort of, you know, service that you're offering to be a consultant. I really want this to take
[00:36:47] off because this is, this is really, really significant. And you really need, you know, look,
[00:36:52] we have coaches for all sorts of things in life. And the idea of having a home stage in coach is
[00:36:57] a really, really cool idea. So, but let's give one tip about primary bedroom. And then I'll let you
[00:37:04] keep your secrets to the rest of our audience who should reach out. The trick is so generous.
[00:37:10] Yeah. I am an open. But let's talk bedroom. Yeah, sure. The primary bedroom. You know, this is where,
[00:37:16] you know, when I'm talking to sellers and REALTORS about this, I always try to say this is the person
[00:37:22] purchasing the home where they're going to be resting their head at night. And so we really want
[00:37:26] this to feel like a place of rest. I mean, intimacy, all those things are going to be happening
[00:37:31] in this space. And so we want them to really feel like that when they walk in. And so we kind of
[00:37:37] joked earlier about Zillow saying, you know, adding white bedding increases your sales price by
[00:37:42] 30% or less time on market by 30%. But I do think there is something to that. And I think that kind of
[00:37:47] goes back to like the hotel or Airbnb thing. When you go to a hotel, you see nice clean white
[00:37:54] bedding and white sheets. And it just, it is always white because it always can be bleached. And it
[00:37:58] always can feel very clean, which is why I feel like that resonates with people. I feel like
[00:38:05] having a proper bedroom. And I think this is one thing that I step on people's toes just a little
[00:38:10] bit having a headboard with a bed and nightstands and lamps, things like that really can showcase that
[00:38:18] bedroom. And even when we do vacant staging and we go in and we put a bed, I don't ever have to
[00:38:23] put a dresser in. I don't feel like I do because that's not like the money shop that people see in
[00:38:27] the room. There's plenty of room for a dresser and they can see that one can go there. But I feel
[00:38:32] showing them, you know, this is a king size bed or this is a queen size bed with proper night
[00:38:37] stands and lamps and a headboard and thing like that. It doesn't have to cost a ton of money,
[00:38:42] but I do feel like it shows a proper space. And then also with the bathroom that's typically
[00:38:46] connected to the primary suite, I feel like making sure of course that's clean. We always encourage
[00:38:51] people to buy fluffy white towels and things like that. I don't think you have to go out and get
[00:38:56] monograms, things and all kinds of wild, expensive things. But even again, it can be as easy as
[00:39:05] Walmart or it can be somewhere else that's more expensive. But no one's going to be using the
[00:39:11] towels. We just want them to be clean and we want them to be white. So those are my tips. And
[00:39:15] not having a lot of personal photos and things like that. And I feel like just rid of all the
[00:39:20] personal photos. Yeah, I feel like this is kind of where things get confusing for people. Because when
[00:39:25] I say, you know, take out all the personal items like your photos and things, you know,
[00:39:31] doilies, oh, doilies, don't get me started. We'll have a whole, you know, conversation on doilies.
[00:39:35] But I think when I say things like that, people think I'm meaning, I don't mean to remove the
[00:39:39] personality from the home. I just mean to remove the personal item. So you can remove all those
[00:39:45] items and then add in some type of personality through art and plants and tasteful accessories.
[00:39:51] Yeah, it's it's yeah, I think you're right. And also if there's a TV in that master suite,
[00:39:56] let's let's remove that for the time being. We can always put it back because there are a lot of
[00:40:01] people like me who would never put a TV in his bedroom only because that's just not how I
[00:40:07] watch TV. And you know, I like to keep my bedroom kind of just to do for one purpose. And
[00:40:12] but not everyone's that way. And some people really enjoy watching TV in bed. And that's great. But
[00:40:17] I would say probably another great idea. I don't really get to get that. I'm gonna help with the
[00:40:21] sale of the home for sure. So and that's kind of what we have how we have to look at it through
[00:40:26] each space is how is it going to help the sale of a home. I mean, I think there's so many things
[00:40:30] we could talk about for animals and for secondary spaces and exterior spaces and all that kind of
[00:40:35] stuff that we kind of have a proper little channel that we go through on each of those. And I
[00:40:39] feel like all of that stuff is is helpful for this sale. So I think lots of secrets left to
[00:40:46] default. Well, well, I want to keep you coming back so we can share some of those secrets with
[00:40:52] our audience. But for right now, I want everybody to check this out. Go to lovely homes.com forward slash
[00:40:58] free. And again, it's L O V E L E E. That's her last name is Lee. So lovely homes.com forward slash free
[00:41:04] and you could download her magazine, which not only explains, you know, makes the case for home
[00:41:10] staging actually shows you some examples and gives you all of the resources you need to be able
[00:41:15] to sell this service because it really should sell itself if you explain it correctly because,
[00:41:20] yes, there's a little bit of money up front. But the return on investment is I mean, I would love to
[00:41:26] I would love to give any institution my money and get a 300% return. I'd be a I'd be a wealthy
[00:41:34] person. So that in and of itself, that's the argument, you know, that's the main argument. And
[00:41:40] you know, you may have to learn how to make that argument. But of course, obviously, you know, I
[00:41:45] was funny. I was as you were talking, I was thinking about my place, which is all I have like white
[00:41:49] everything because of three or three years ago, everything was white. And it still is. And that's
[00:41:54] and that's fine. But I was thinking and I keep my place pretty not minimal. But but but anyway,
[00:42:00] I was thinking if I were selling it right now, would I stage it? And I went, oh, I totally would
[00:42:05] because I don't know what shouldn't be in there. Like I don't know. And it's going to be like,
[00:42:09] okay, remove this, remove this, remove this. It's probably just a lot of subtraction more than
[00:42:12] anything. And that's great because then, you know, it could what does it cost $30 to rent a for a
[00:42:19] month, a, you know, a storage locker or storage unit. It's not that expensive to get that stuff out
[00:42:24] of there, move it into somewhere. And even if all you're doing is taking things out, you know,
[00:42:29] I mean editing is a really large process of the staging definitely. It really is. And and in
[00:42:36] complete and total transparency, I sold my house and moved seven years ago. And I had to have a
[00:42:43] friend come, I mean, we, you know, those commercials where they say you've gone nose blind, you know,
[00:42:49] to whatever your smell would be or whatever. I always joke about going I blind, which I think is
[00:42:53] technically what blind is. But I think I, you know, when your own space, it's really hard. You get
[00:42:59] used to seeing things the way they are and you get used to seeing that. So having a fresh set of
[00:43:03] eyes come in and say, Oh, this probably shouldn't be here. I know this probably feels very normal to you
[00:43:09] to have your couch facing this direction or to have your, you know, entryway with this or your
[00:43:15] dining table rotated this way. I mean, there's things that seem very normal because of the way that
[00:43:20] you're accustomed to living. But I think again, like we said in the beginning, selling is totally
[00:43:24] different and staging is totally different than living in your home. And so I think it is important
[00:43:30] to get a fresh set of eyes for sure. Yeah, it is because we know as real estate professionals that
[00:43:36] when we go to sell our own properties, we overvalue them and we know better. We know this is what
[00:43:41] people do. We do the same thing because it's human nature. We don't see what someone else sees
[00:43:46] because we love our places. We love everything and then we love the little knick-knacks because they
[00:43:51] mean something to us. But we, and so we, like you said, there's, there's a, there is a, I think
[00:43:56] they're called Gestaltzer or some sort of blot, you know, whatever the blind spot is. Those are
[00:44:00] blind spots. And that's where you need an expert. And that's, I think, what's really, again, the pitch I
[00:44:06] keep hearing in my head is REALTOR coming in and saying, look, one of the things that you may not
[00:44:11] know about real estate agencies, we are fiduciaries. And what that means is we are literally responsible
[00:44:16] for the, for your financial decisions around selling this property and my job, I am bound by an oath
[00:44:22] to get you the highest possible price. You know, that's my job and I'm literally bound by, by some
[00:44:28] of these roles. And so I'm going to tell you some things about what we need to move around here.
[00:44:33] And I have a, you know, I have a team of consultants. We're going to go through it, you know,
[00:44:36] room by room. We're going to show you exactly what we need to do and what it, what's going to happen
[00:44:40] is the home is going to sell faster. It's going to sell for more money. And so like that's all I mean.
[00:44:45] And that's a win for everyone faster and more money. Who doesn't want that? Who doesn't want
[00:44:49] to sell their house faster and get rid of all the carrying costs and all that kind of stuff. And I
[00:44:54] feel like it's a win-win win for everyone. Well, and imagine too. Imagine if you're interviewing,
[00:45:00] you're a home seller and you're interviewing three REALTORS to maybe possibly sell your home.
[00:45:04] And they all have probably somewhat similar presentations. We're going to list it. We're going to
[00:45:08] market it. We're going to do open houses and we'll put a sign in the yard and we'll spruce it up.
[00:45:14] Great. Those are all great. But if I were an agent practicing, I would go, no, no, I want to talk
[00:45:19] about something that people don't usually talk about because it could seem uncomfortable.
[00:45:23] But I'm telling you this is so important. And I'm also bound by this fiduciary oath. So I have
[00:45:29] to tell you these things. And again, right then and there, all of a sudden you're different from
[00:45:34] every other agent. Absolutely. I can't tell you the number of times we have had, you know,
[00:45:39] REALTORS who have come in and they'll give us a call and they'll be like, okay, this house has
[00:45:44] set on the market for six months and it is not moving. And, you know, you know, I'm getting this
[00:45:50] listing now or that people, you know, have gotten rid of their last real turn there. I'm trying to
[00:45:55] get this listing or something like that. Would you be available to come in and tell them what to do?
[00:45:59] Or, you know, is this something that you can do? And every single time I mean, and this has happened
[00:46:03] time after time after time that buyers have come in to see it before it was staged and want nothing
[00:46:09] to do with it. And then buyers come into the same home after it staged and they're like, oh my gosh,
[00:46:14] this is my dream space. And literally the only thing that changed was the furniture or literally
[00:46:19] the only thing that changed was, you know, the removal of clutter or a fresh coat of neutral paint
[00:46:25] or, you know, there's just so many things that you don't know what buyers are thinking. I mean,
[00:46:29] I feel like I do. I've kind of devoted my life to it. But I feel like, you know, there's definitely
[00:46:34] ways that can make it make them make it appeal to them a lot more for sure.
[00:46:40] Yeah. And again, what I will ask our audience to do is take a chance on this on your next
[00:46:46] on your next listing. Contact Trisha if you go to lovelyhomes.com you'll see your services and
[00:46:53] she has a few consulting services. One is home staging, another one's interior design.
[00:46:58] You know, her home staging consultation is incredibly affordable. Go ahead and try it.
[00:47:04] Do it with her and see what happens to how, you know, the home, how the home performs. And also
[00:47:11] to how your clients look at you because you can say to them, I have a home stage of consultant that
[00:47:16] I work with. I'm going to video this entire property and I'm going to come back to you with a bunch
[00:47:20] of ideas. And again, you're going to see the value in this. And again, you don't have to be the
[00:47:25] expert. You don't have to know any of this stuff. This is what's this is what's so great about
[00:47:30] considering yourself a consultant. Consultants don't come in and immediately go, this is what we need
[00:47:34] to fix in your business or whatever kind of consult they go, they look around or they look at the
[00:47:39] business. They look, they do a lot of analysis and then they come back with a solution, right?
[00:47:44] Consultants come back. And so this idea is you don't have to know the answers right away. You just
[00:47:48] have to hem and haunt kind of go, hmm, that's interesting and take pictures and video go, okay,
[00:47:53] I'm going to take this back to my team. I'm going to come back to you in a week or a couple of days
[00:47:56] and we're going to get to work. That is an incredibly powerful, I mean, most agents don't do that.
[00:48:03] So yeah, absolutely. Absolutely. Absolutely. I mean, I think anything that can make you look like you
[00:48:10] have, you know, more knowledge in the area just makes you have a more professional image
[00:48:16] to your clients. I love it. Well, again, lovely homes.com is where you go forward slash free for her
[00:48:23] magazine that will really help sort of get you on the path of making the case about why home
[00:48:28] stage is important. And by the way, if you loved hearing Trisha on this episode and I know you did,
[00:48:33] let her know that you appreciated her being on the show and let me know that you loved hearing
[00:48:37] her too, because I'm having like this is a great episode for me. I love learning things like this.
[00:48:43] And now I have knowledge to share with other agents that Trisha has given me. So I appreciate
[00:48:47] you Trisha, of course, for taking time to give away some of your give away some of the secrets to
[00:48:53] our audience. It's very much appreciated. And you are incredibly generous and kind. And again,
[00:48:58] I think this home stage and consultation or consulting business you have is just going to sky,
[00:49:03] if it's already probably skyrocketing, but I want to see it keep growing and growing because I
[00:49:07] just think it's a brilliant idea. And I want everybody to check it out. So on behalf of our audience,
[00:49:12] we all say thank you to Trisha for coming on and sharing her wisdom about how to, I mean, again,
[00:49:18] how to help how to help home so faster and for more money. It's like, you don't really get a
[00:49:22] better deal than that. And on behalf of Trisha and myself, also we want to thank the audience for
[00:49:27] making it all the way to the end. We appreciate you. We only do this because of you and we couldn't
[00:49:33] say thank you enough. So the best way that you can help us, obviously go check Trisha's stuff out,
[00:49:38] of course, and tell another friend about this episode, tell another agent in your office who doesn't
[00:49:43] know anything about home staging and maybe even skeptical about it and say, I've got this episode,
[00:49:48] I want you to check out send them over. It really helps us, of course, and you're going to be helping
[00:49:52] that agent along the way. So you can find us anywhere podcasts are served. Our website, you can even

Trisha, welcome to the show. Thank you so much for having me. I am so excited to talk to you. I haven't done this show for seven years. I think maybe I've had one or two home staging episodes over that entire time. I can't even remember how many years it's been since the last one. So this is super exciting because it's a part of the business that I feel doesn't really get it's due. I don't think it's talked about enough. It's funny because the home staging experts will tell REALTORS, like, no, you'll actually sell this for more money. This is actually a money- Absolutely. ...that positive situation. And I think a lot of agents just maybe they're not exposed to it, or they don't think about it, or they think their clients won't pay for it. So today we're going to make the case on why virtually every home should at least have some sort of staging opportunity. So let's start with you. How did you get into home staging? Well, you've always had an interest in it. For some from the first time I was looking at homes to buy my first home. And then when I sold my first home and when I sold my second home, and I just really wanted to present a good product. I used to sell insurance a long time ago, and we learned all about the need behind the need, or the why behind the why, and why are people needing this, or why do we need to show them that they need that? And so I kind of integrated that into the home staging process when long many, many, many years ago. And then once I was able to kind of decide, well, you know, when people are coming in, they want to really connect with this home. They want to spend time with their family and friends here. They want to have Christmas here, or send their daughter off to prom here, and things like that. And so really trying to create this emotional connection of having breakfast in the breakfast nook, or dinner parties at the dinner table, or breakfast in bed, and things like that. And so I started to do little things like that many, many years ago. And then before the internet, you know, a long time ago. Oh, I remember. Yeah, way long time ago before the internet. And then once I, I mean, I tried to, I delved into so much, you know, the library and all the places you could find any kind of just more sales of information about the home buying process or home staging, which back then 20 years ago, there wasn't really a whole lot of information about it. And since then, you know, about 10 years ago when I started this company, I really was just helping a neighbor get her house sold. We live in a really nice area with a really, really good school district, and homes typically sell very, very quickly. And hers was very low price, and it just sat there and she kept lowering the price, and lowering the price. And I think one thing that is so important with home staging is people actually telling the truth. And you can tell the truth in love, which is kind of where we came up with lovely homes. I think, you know, sometimes sellers get so desperate and they just want people to tell them either what's wrong with their home and why it's not selling. And I think people are so afraid to hurt their feelings that they, you know, they don't want to tell them that it has an odor or they don't want to tell them that it's dirty or they don't want to tell them things like that. And I feel like at some, you know, they get to a point where they're so desperate to really know why it isn't selling. And so I think that's, we speak the truth in love. So we do come at it from a way that we want to definitely tell you, you know, things that are going to make a difference. And so that's kind of what I had to do with my neighbor. I walked into her formal living room and there was a pool table in her living room. And I was like, you, you know, you walk right in the front door and there's a beautiful fireplace and all this stuff. And there was a pool table. And I was just like, are you a professional pool player? And she's like, because that would be the only good reason to have a That would be it. Like if your livelihood came from playing pool and she's like, oh, no, I hate that thing. You know, and I'm like, then why in the world would you have that right inside your front door? And anyway, so that kind of, we just, I went through her house and she didn't have a dining room table. And I'm like, this is where young families live. You know, you're in a, you know, first time home buying price point of a home and people need to sit down and eat dinner with their kids, you know, and so just a whole assembly of things. But anyway, it had been on the market for several months and had sold and they'd reduced the price of lunch. And I went in and moved things around and took stuff down and created a dining room and did some things like that. And she ended up getting multiple offers when her REALTOR took new pictures and put it back online. And so then I was not a home stater. I was a stay-at-home mom. And then that REALTOR said, I have another house. I'd really like you to take a look at. And I was like, oh, no, no, I don't do this. You know, this isn't my thing. I just really understand what was wrong. And she's like, please calm. I will pay you money. And then I thought, well, I guess I could do this. I took my little baby with me and a way we went. And he's now having his 11th birthday here in a couple days. And so yeah, we, but anyway, I had just learned and written down so many things about why we would really, why the emotional connection is so important. And just all these different strategies that have come up with over the years. So, yeah, that's how I got into it. And we should also mention, I'd like to say this. I want to say this upfront because it's a really important distinction between you and other local home stages. You are located in Kansas and for all of our audience that goes, well, I don't practice real estate in Kansas. Don't worry because we have Trisha on because she has a consulting, a home staging consulting practice as well. She's the only person I know in the whole industry that does this. So she can actually help you no matter where you are or where the property is. So I wanted to make sure that that's that's something. And you can learn about that at lovelyhomes.com, of course. Let's make the case. Well, actually, let's let me be the the REALTOR who doesn't want to home stage at home. I'll give you probably a reason you hear constantly, you know, often it's too expensive and or either I, the REALTOR doesn't want, I don't want to pay for it and or I don't know how to pitch it to my client to get them to pay for it. So this comes up a lot. I'm sure. So what would you say to an agent who says it's just too expensive? I mean, I feel like the the first thing I would say is when you are even considering home staging, I feel like it's important to approach it with asking home seizures or looking for a home seizure in your area or even one online and seeing what their approach to it is because I feel like you can work in any price point as a home seizure. Here in Kansas, we do vacant home staging. We also do occupied home staging. We approach those totally different. We I feel like the budget really concerns with there's so many things that are free. Like cleaning is free. I mean, unless you aren't able or don't have elbow grease to put into it. So I feel like there's that. I feel like, you know, opening blinds and taking down old curtains and things like that is free. I feel like, you know, turning on the lights that are already in your home is free. I feel like and then the other things that are so cost effective, like, fresh, neutral paint and things like that, you get back 125% of what it costs to do it in the price of the home. So I know the national association of REALTORS have done so much research and have so many statistics on home staging and they have a return on investment of 300% for home staging. So every one dollar that you spend, you get three dollars back. So I feel like it's it is an investment because it does cost a little bit money, but I always tell people it costs way less than a price reduction does. So I feel like being able to put a little bit up front, it also just the impact of it for REALTORS. I mean, I feel like it makes sure of houses sell faster, which in turn is good for you in the long run. It gives you a perceived an increased perceived value on the home and then also on your business as a REALTOR. I feel like it increases your professional image, just making you look like you know more about what you're doing. Even if you're not the one teaching them how to stage it, like because you have a professional that does that, just like in your role at X of having painters or having, you know, a handyman or an electrician or things like that. Also having a really good home stageer in your back pocket is just makes you look like a professional REALTOR. Your first impressions on your homes are always better. You have less days on market. The biggest thing I think a lot of people, we spent a lot of time on trying to minimize the negotiation obstacles at the end of the process like once you have sold the house and because you've taken the extra step on, you know, making sure all, you know, the air filters have been cleaned and the gutters are good and you've done these checklists and, you know, points on our, like we have a checklist that we hand them that they can make sure all these things have been taken care of before they get to the inspections and things like that that can slow things down at the end. So I do feel like it's, you know, it does cost a little bit as an investment but definitely pays in dividends, you know, with so much higher price, you know, a higher sales price in the end and those types of things. And then to answer your other question about, you know, finding a home stageer, I know we talked a little bit about this but we interviewed so many REALTORS here in our town and we were struggling a little bit just to kind of get the information out and why staging was important because of those things that you've just mentioned. And we put together a magazine that has all of those questions answered. I feel like for women, they walk into the home and have this real emotional connection and men are like, let me look at the windows and let me look at the, you know, the H back and stuff like that. And so men really struggle a lot more than women with home staging and why it's important. And so in our REALTORS guidebook to home staging, we put in statistics because numbers talk to men a lot more than they do to women typically. They talk to me both ways but I feel like in our guidebook it has, you know, statistics on why this is a good investment to make. And then of course there's pretty pictures of why it actually gives that first impression. So, you know, in today's day and age we talked about being getting started in this before the internet. But since the internet has come along, you know, your very first piece of marketing is your pictures online that people are seeing. And so really making those stand out as being, you know, a very tidy, well-maintained bright light and neutral home are the things that are going to appeal to buyers right away. Yeah. And, you know, I also, so by the way, to get that guide, it's lovelyhomes.com forward slash free. So we'll have a link to that in the show notes. Download this guide. It has all the stats. It tells you how to overcome objections and just gives you a lot of good information on makes the case for why home staging is so important. And I was thinking because you have this consulting opportunity, you know, for people all over the world, I was thinking, you know, you were mentioning is as becoming a real estate professional. One of the ways you could differentiate yourself is really getting knowledgeable about why home staging is so significant. And by the way, I've entered all I do on this show is interview the top 1% of REALTORS across the country. And they all do home staging. Like literally they all do it. It's it's rare. If I meet the only people that don't do it are people that have their own stock. And they just like, you know, so if you eventually get to a certain size of REALTOR, you might just be buying your own stuff and you're staging it yourself. But everyone else uses home, they're, you know, some sort of home stage or but I was thinking was you said something, you know, this idea that you're a consultant is really interesting because what I think I would want to do if I were a practicing agent is I would want to go into a home and say, I also want to take a look and give you some home staging ideas and go around and take notes and take videos. And then I would come back and hire you to go over that with me because then you would say, okay, DJ, you're going to tell them do this, this, this, and this. I would pay you a fee to do that because then I get to go back and be the hero anyway. And then I get to go and say, okay, this is what we need to do. And, you know, then, you can make the case for, for, you know, how it's a good investment and all of that. But I think that would be an amazing thing. Instead of hiring a local home stage, which by the way, great option to and sometimes you'll need to do that if you need to rent furniture and things like that. But just to go in and do the like, hey, I'm a REALTOR, I know what I'm talking about, you know, go in, take video. I'm going to come back to you with some ideas and, you know, talk to Trisha in between and she will tell you what to do. I think that in and of itself is an unbelievably smart thing for an agent to do. Absolutely. And I think it can help too. Like I was mentioning earlier, we're going to be coaching a workshop on like all of these different things that need to happen during and how to kind of progress through the home for staging it and getting it ready. And I think that, um, being able to have someone to, you know, look to or to, you know, even a resource to work off of, I think is very, is very, very important. And I think being able to just have that confidence that you know, looking at the home, what needs to be done next is also a valuable tool as well. And does make you out to be the professional, which I think, you know, you're in a lot of homes and you're doing that. So, um, knowing what to look for is definitely a good thing. Yeah, I just think that's so cool. If you go to a listing presentation and say, hey, one of the things I do for my clients that is a bit unique is I am going to tell you exactly how to stage this property. And I have a, you know, a team of people that I consult with to make sure and I'm going to come back to you with all these ideas and trishes of the team. And I mean, that is an incredible amount of value, um, to provide. And I want to talk about why home staging is so important, um, just aesthetically. So, obviously, you know, there's a lot of stats that will tell us why it's a good return on investment. And that's all great. But I also just think, you know, we talk about aesthetics. Instagram is nothing but a perfect aesthetics, right? Like it's essentially, uh, for us to make our lives and everything look a little bit shinier and cleaner than they really are more beautiful than they are. And that's no exception with, with, uh, with homes, right? And so we certainly see, you know, images of homes that are poorly staged or aren't staged at all. But we haven't expect, I think, as consumers of social media, we have an expectation that a home actually looks like in person that looks like what we see on Instagram for, you know, home after home after home. And even though that's probably an unfair thing to put on a homeowner, it is the reality in which we live in. And you might as well play with, in, in, with the cards were dealt because the expectation is going to be that everything looks perfect. And home staging gets you as close to that as possible. And I'm curious your thoughts on this. Yes. I mean, gone are the days of just having to hide the kitty litter. That's for sure. You know, like, we have surpassed that by a mile. And I feel like, um, I do feel like it's important that we like look at it as, you know, a, as a marketing tool, as a marketing piece. You have this object that we're wanting to sell and we have to feature it in its best light. And so I feel like the staging is going to be, um, really trying instead, besides just decorating, I mean, I think people kind of get those two confused. When I go into a home, that mean the first thing I say is how we live is totally different than how we stage. So, for example, I was helping a family get their dining room ready to sell or with that's the part of the tour we were on in the home. And I said that, you know, that film on the window is awful. You sit in this chair and eat dinner. The sun hits you right in the eye. And I was like, that sounds magical. Let's rip that nasty stuff down because we want so much of that sun to come into this room. And you know, when they sit down and have dinner in here, they're going to have to deal with that. But for now, we want all the light that we can to come into this room. So I think that, um, preparing the home for sale is definitely different than how we live. And honestly, on Instagram, I mean, nobody really lives like that anyway. All the mess is on the other side of the camera. But we don't think about that when we're looking at this beautiful picture. So I feel like that's kind of the, you know, we're trying to prepare this thing to go to market. And we want it to look. It's very, very best. We want to maximize the features that are there. If there's a fireplace or a view or a beautiful chef kitchen, kitchen, we're always trying to make those things elevate those things and make those even better. And then if there is something like a like flaws, we always want to try to minimize those. So if you don't have enough storage, I mean, let's just let that be our little secret. And we'll take as much stuff as we have inside of your cabinets and inside of your closets and things like that and pack those away to move and then let the buyers see how much base you actually have, you know, there is all this space here or things like that. So I definitely think it is, um, you know, presenting this, you know, magical thing that someone can connect with visually and then connect with emotionally and then ultimately purchase for a higher price than the one next store. That's our goal. Yeah. It's, you know, this just idea of clutter is is really great if if that's where how you like to live with certain, I don't mean, you know, tremendous clutter, but just having things out on, you know, that are permanent sort of things that sit out on counters because they're keepsakes or whatever they may be, they're important, you know, emotionally to you. Get them out of there for the photos, right? We want to see everybody wants clean lines. We don't want to see the toaster oven sitting out on the, you know, put that put that in the closet. But I would love to hear, I'd love to go just just one little tip per room, if possible, or rather a mistake that people make per room would be great as well. So, you know, when, because you must see just a ton of listings and most listings are not staged, right? And you probably are like, how, you know, this is, but again, you don't know what you don't know. So this is how a lot of audience. So let's, let's think about, we'll start with the, we'll start with the primary bedroom. Sure. I was going to say, let's start at the curb. That's normally what I, let's start at the curb. Okay, start at the front like our approach. We kind of check that out. I think a lot, the number one thing people often miss is their front porch. And when I say their front porch, I mean like they're the tightiness of the front porch, especially in our area, a lot of people enter the home through the garage. And so they rarely are on their front porch. And so, you know, I always tell them, you know, the week leading up to your house, you know, the photos and stuff being taken, come back out here to your front porch and check it for like cobwebs and spiderwebs and, you know, all that kind of stuff that can creep up pretty quickly here, especially and, you know, sweeping off your front porch when people are coming to tour your home, they're typically coming from another house with the agent. And so they'll be on the front porch with them while they're waiting for the MLS key to open. And so they're out there, you know, for maybe 20 to 30 seconds standing on your front porch and just looking. And so I always tell people, you know, just revisit your front porch before people come or before your photos are taken. So that's one thing I think is, um, and maybe even ask a few friends to come and say, I need you to take off that take off your hat that we're friends and I need you to put on your buyer hat. Yes. Imagine you're driving up to my property. What don't you like from the outside? Right. You know, I think a lot of people have overgrowth. I mean, there's so many things I could list, but that typically is the number like one of the things that people miss is their front porch and just having, you know, a fresh dorma is eight dollars at Walmart. I mean, just get one that says, welcome, no colors, no streamers, no frilly things, just welcome and a nice fresh dorma and make sure everything is clean. And I think that that really speaks a lot to buyers. So walking into the home, then like in your entryway, that kind of thing, I think entryways can vary, you know, how large they are or small they are if they're the table or room for any of that kind of stuff. But one thing I tell people to do is to remove anything that says you don't have enough storage. So that would be like a hall tree or an extra thing of hooks and things like that just says we don't have enough storage in our storage closet. That's great. I never would have thought of that, but you're absolutely right. Yeah. So that one or the other one would be like in the entry closet that you do have if it's full, completely full, that's one of the very first doors that people open when they come into tour house is going to be that entry closet. And so I always tell people to keep that, you know, deep down size your coat collection and your coat closet. One of my tips is to store it in luggage that you aren't using right now because it's, you know, used to having clothing and things like that. It's got wheels. It's easy to move. So store your out of season coats or things that you're not using a lot. And then try to keep that floor clean on your entryway closet because it makes the entryway feel a little bit larger. And we all care about one thing with closets is how much space there are. And you can't tell it's really the only thing we care about with closets is how big they are. So and having an empty floor in the closet makes the closet feel twice as large. Oh, that's a great tip empty floor. So would you recommend just completely emptying out a hall or an entryway closet? I mean, if you're, if it's a vacant home, obviously it's going to be empty. If you're living there in a summertime, you know, maybe you can have just a few things in there. Otherwise, it might seem weird. But I feel like, you know, one coat per person in your home is probably just going to be enough all the excess. I just, you know, you shouldn't have 50 coffee mugs in your kitchen and you shouldn't have 50 coats in your closet. So all right. So getting through the entryway, what are what do we have tackle next? Let's tackle, usually dining rooms are pretty close by. I think so my biggest thing on the dining room is people always have the shades or there's a really heavy drapery in there. And so I always try to get people to let natural light in making sure that all of the light bulbs in the chandelier are the same color. So the same Kelvin temperature and depending on if your home is really gray or really brown, that's kind of where we would choose a different colored light bulb there. But I feel like just making sure all the light bulbs are the same color to start off with is a really big factor that can show up and just look kind of tacky and pictures. So we just want to make sure those light bulbs are the same color. A lot of times I encourage people to set a dining room table very minimally. It just makes it really trigger emotional connection with fires. So yeah, that would be my main for the dining room is the light is a really big deal. All right, where are we going next? Let's travel to the living room. I feel like a lot of the gatherings and family time are going to be happening in there. And the same thing with making sure that the you know a lot of times with blinds, a lot of people have blinds in there and they'll just want to turn them open. And honestly, people don't ever usually open their blinds, which I think is so strange. But opening the blinds and actually pulling the blinds up so that you can see the full window and let the full light in and make sure your furniture, if you do have oversized furniture that you remove some of it. So you don't have wall to wall furniture. And then really highlighting the features. If you have a fireplace, maybe flinks some chairs on either side. If your view is what is the best thing, make sure that you have a walk. You don't push a couch right up next to the window. So people can't walk next to the window. So really trying to highlight whatever your feature is and make that even better. And what about even just like removing a big giant TV that's not mounted to a wall or you know, obviously if it's mounted, that's a bigger challenge. But you know, if you have like a free standing TV that makes the room look smaller, I suspect there's times where like get that out of there, put it in a closet and you can always put it back. Absolutely. You can't always put it back. And I think, you know, when we do vacant staging, people are like, oh, are you going to hang a TV in this room? And I'm like, you know, TV's aren't that pretty. If you think about it, nobody wants to see a TV. Nobody wants to see a TV. I mean, unless it's in some type of a theater room or a basement, something or another. I mean, I feel like that. But I mean, a really nice piece of large, chastel art is always going to have a better connection with people than a TV. So yeah. All right. So that's living room. Let's go to kitchen. Yes, the kitchen. I tell you what, you know, kitchen's common all shapes and sizes and colors. But I feel like they all have the same function in mind that this is where we're going to be, you know, preparing our food and that kind of a thing. So when I think of that, I try to tell people to spend the most time cleaning their kitchen, cleaning the inside of their appliances, the outside of their appliances, and organizing their kitchen, people open pantry doors, people open your cabinetry, they open your silverware drawer, all of that's connected. And so I think when people see a very tidy, clean and organized kitchen, it really shows that you have maintained your home properly. Yeah, you know, psychologically, it's going to tell these buyers that you have changed your air filter every three months and that if a leak has happened, you've taken care of that promptly because you are a clean, tidy, and organized person. And so I feel like that's a very important thing, especially in the kitchen, to really drive home. I have some friends who have this beautiful home in a blowing rock. I believe in the kitchen. So when people know that this is the main thing, it's going to tell people and both of these guys are absolute design nerds. And in their entire kitchen, there is not one thing out, there is not one appliance out. There is literally, it is just clean. And it's, and when you walk into, so to to your point, when you walk in and see it, it blows you away because no one's home looks like that, except for these two guys. And, and I mean, it looks like straight out of well, they're clearly don't live there kind of thing, but it's so beautifully done that you think, wow, these guys are on top of stuff. Like they're organized, they have their shit together. You know, and it just makes the police look like you're right. It sort of makes you think more highly of the of the place itself. And that's this is something anyone can do really. Oh, absolutely. I mean, that doesn't it just is, you know, it is what it is. It is taking 50 coffee mugs down to maybe six. And it is, you know, getting rid of all the excess so that you have room in your current kitchen to be able to store things that you do use daily, but inside of a cabinet space. And so I think that's one of the biggest things if it were just to pick one thing for the room would be to have it, you know, clean, tidy and organized. And just because it says so much about that, I mean, people know when you are when you're buying a pre-owned home, you know that someone has lived there. Obviously, their stuff is there. But it's I always try to relate that to people about when you go stay in an Airbnb or when you go stay in a hotel, you know that other people have stayed there. You just don't want it to feel like that. You don't want to see dirty towels on the floor when you come into a hotel. You don't want to see a bed unmade when you go into an Airbnb. You want it to feel very clean. Like you're the first person to come there and stay there. It makes you feel like that it's a place that you could live. So even though they know you're moving out before they buy the home, they just wanted to feel like a very clean place. And I just was thinking, well, I want to make this point or get your take on this point because and it's not just about staging it for the photos because that's part one. And then part two is making sure it looks like that when the person walks in, which again, that's a big ask. We understand that people need to live where they live and they yes, they're going to be a little inconvenience maybe. And there's some other stuff's not going to be where they want it to be. But it's important that when they walk in that, you know, the kitchen in the photo, and this is the problem with virtual staging. So I'm going to say virtual staging has its place and it could be great. But the challenge is if the home, if the kitchen doesn't look like what's in the pictures, whether it's virtually staged or professionally staged and then the person just puts it back to normal, there's going to be a huge disconnect there. And it's going to be like, oh, it's almost going to feel like the photos are no longer real. Like the photos. Almost like a beaten switch kind of into, I feel like as well. And I, you know, I try to really convey that if all these things are done, and you know, even if it's done right before pictures and then pictures are taken in two days later, your house is put on the market and between the time the pictures are taken, you take a little weekend get away. I feel like if all things are done properly and the home is priced at the right price, which is due to the REALTOR and agreeing on the price to put it up. And the pictures are professional. And everything has been marketed the way it should be. It really should just take three by our statistics show that there's three buyers that come into the house and at least one of them puts an offer in. So for us, that's how we look at it is maybe if you do everything right and everything gets done and it's, you know, all of that happens. You only have to live with it like that for the weekend. If we can get, you know, through this weekend and everything is price right, market right, all that kind of stuff stays right and everything looks like as it should, then hopefully you don't have to do a very long. Well, I don't want you to give away all of your secrets, but I know. And I would, I would, I want to hold because I want people to contact you as well. And I want this sort of, you know, service that you're offering to be a consultant. I really want this to take off because this is, this is really, really significant. And you really need, you know, look, we have coaches for all sorts of things in life. And the idea of having a home stage in coach is a really, really cool idea. So, but let's give one tip about primary bedroom. And then I'll let you keep your secrets to the rest of our audience who should reach out. The trick is so generous. Yeah. I am an open. But let's talk bedroom. Yeah, sure. The primary bedroom. You know, this is where, you know, when I'm talking to sellers and REALTORS about this, I always try to say this is the person purchasing the home where they're going to be resting their head at night. And so we really want this to feel like a place of rest. I mean, intimacy, all those things are going to be happening in this space. And so we want them to really feel like that when they walk in. And so we kind of joked earlier about Zillow saying, you know, adding white bedding increases your sales price by 30% or less time on market by 30%. But I do think there is something to that. And I think that kind of goes back to like the hotel or Airbnb thing. When you go to a hotel, you see nice clean white bedding and white sheets. And it just, it is always white because it always can be bleached. And it always can feel very clean, which is why I feel like that resonates with people. I feel like having a proper bedroom. And I think this is one thing that I step on people's toes just a little bit having a headboard with a bed and nightstands and lamps, things like that really can showcase that bedroom. And even when we do vacant staging and we go in and we put a bed, I don't ever have to put a dresser in. I don't feel like I do because that's not like the money shop that people see in the room. There's plenty of room for a dresser and they can see that one can go there. But I feel showing them, you know, this is a king size bed or this is a queen size bed with proper night stands and lamps and a headboard and thing like that. It doesn't have to cost a ton of money, but I do feel like it shows a proper space. And then also with the bathroom that's typically connected to the primary suite, I feel like making sure of course that's clean. We always encourage people to buy fluffy white towels and things like that. I don't think you have to go out and get monograms, things and all kinds of wild, expensive things. But even again, it can be as easy as Walmart or it can be somewhere else that's more expensive. But no one's going to be using the towels. We just want them to be clean and we want them to be white. So those are my tips. And not having a lot of personal photos and things like that. And I feel like just rid of all the personal photos. Yeah, I feel like this is kind of where things get confusing for people. Because when I say, you know, take out all the personal items like your photos and things, you know, doilies, oh, doilies, don't get me started. We'll have a whole, you know, conversation on doilies. But I think when I say things like that, people think I'm meaning, I don't mean to remove the personality from the home. I just mean to remove the personal item. So you can remove all those items and then add in some type of personality through art and plants and tasteful accessories. Yeah, it's it's yeah, I think you're right. And also if there's a TV in that master suite, let's let's remove that for the time being. We can always put it back because there are a lot of people like me who would never put a TV in his bedroom only because that's just not how I watch TV. And you know, I like to keep my bedroom kind of just to do for one purpose. And but not everyone's that way. And some people really enjoy watching TV in bed. And that's great. But I would say probably another great idea. I don't really get to get that. I'm gonna help with the sale of the home for sure. So and that's kind of what we have how we have to look at it through each space is how is it going to help the sale of a home. I mean, I think there's so many things we could talk about for animals and for secondary spaces and exterior spaces and all that kind of stuff that we kind of have a proper little channel that we go through on each of those. And I feel like all of that stuff is is helpful for this sale. So I think lots of secrets left to default. Well, well, I want to keep you coming back so we can share some of those secrets with our audience. But for right now, I want everybody to check this out. Go to lovely homes.com forward slash free. And again, it's L O V E L E E. That's her last name is Lee. So lovely homes.com forward slash free and you could download her magazine, which not only explains, you know, makes the case for home staging actually shows you some examples and gives you all of the resources you need to be able to sell this service because it really should sell itself if you explain it correctly because, yes, there's a little bit of money up front. But the return on investment is I mean, I would love to I would love to give any institution my money and get a 300% return. I'd be a I'd be a wealthy person. So that in and of itself, that's the argument, you know, that's the main argument. And you know, you may have to learn how to make that argument. But of course, obviously, you know, I was funny. I was as you were talking, I was thinking about my place, which is all I have like white everything because of three or three years ago, everything was white. And it still is. And that's and that's fine. But I was thinking and I keep my place pretty not minimal. But but but anyway, I was thinking if I were selling it right now, would I stage it? And I went, oh, I totally would because I don't know what shouldn't be in there. Like I don't know. And it's going to be like, okay, remove this, remove this, remove this. It's probably just a lot of subtraction more than anything. And that's great because then, you know, it could what does it cost $30 to rent a for a month, a, you know, a storage locker or storage unit. It's not that expensive to get that stuff out of there, move it into somewhere. And even if all you're doing is taking things out, you know, I mean editing is a really large process of the staging definitely. It really is. And and in complete and total transparency, I sold my house and moved seven years ago. And I had to have a friend come, I mean, we, you know, those commercials where they say you've gone nose blind, you know, to whatever your smell would be or whatever. I always joke about going I blind, which I think is technically what blind is. But I think I, you know, when your own space, it's really hard. You get used to seeing things the way they are and you get used to seeing that. So having a fresh set of eyes come in and say, Oh, this probably shouldn't be here. I know this probably feels very normal to you to have your couch facing this direction or to have your, you know, entryway with this or your dining table rotated this way. I mean, there's things that seem very normal because of the way that you're accustomed to living. But I think again, like we said in the beginning, selling is totally different and staging is totally different than living in your home. And so I think it is important to get a fresh set of eyes for sure. Yeah, it is because we know as real estate professionals that when we go to sell our own properties, we overvalue them and we know better. We know this is what people do. We do the same thing because it's human nature. We don't see what someone else sees because we love our places. We love everything and then we love the little knick-knacks because they mean something to us. But we, and so we, like you said, there's, there's a, there is a, I think they're called Gestaltzer or some sort of blot, you know, whatever the blind spot is. Those are blind spots. And that's where you need an expert. And that's, I think, what's really, again, the pitch I keep hearing in my head is REALTOR coming in and saying, look, one of the things that you may not know about real estate agencies, we are fiduciaries. And what that means is we are literally responsible for the, for your financial decisions around selling this property and my job, I am bound by an oath to get you the highest possible price. You know, that's my job and I'm literally bound by, by some of these roles. And so I'm going to tell you some things about what we need to move around here. And I have a, you know, I have a team of consultants. We're going to go through it, you know, room by room. We're going to show you exactly what we need to do and what it, what's going to happen is the home is going to sell faster. It's going to sell for more money. And so like that's all I mean. And that's a win for everyone faster and more money. Who doesn't want that? Who doesn't want to sell their house faster and get rid of all the carrying costs and all that kind of stuff. And I feel like it's a win-win win for everyone. Well, and imagine too. Imagine if you're interviewing, you're a home seller and you're interviewing three REALTORS to maybe possibly sell your home. And they all have probably somewhat similar presentations. We're going to list it. We're going to market it. We're going to do open houses and we'll put a sign in the yard and we'll spruce it up. Great. Those are all great. But if I were an agent practicing, I would go, no, no, I want to talk about something that people don't usually talk about because it could seem uncomfortable. But I'm telling you this is so important. And I'm also bound by this fiduciary oath. So I have to tell you these things. And again, right then and there, all of a sudden you're different from every other agent. Absolutely. I can't tell you the number of times we have had, you know, REALTORS who have come in and they'll give us a call and they'll be like, okay, this house has set on the market for six months and it is not moving. And, you know, you know, I'm getting this listing now or that people, you know, have gotten rid of their last real turn there. I'm trying to get this listing or something like that. Would you be available to come in and tell them what to do? Or, you know, is this something that you can do? And every single time I mean, and this has happened time after time after time that buyers have come in to see it before it was staged and want nothing to do with it. And then buyers come into the same home after it staged and they're like, oh my gosh, this is my dream space. And literally the only thing that changed was the furniture or literally the only thing that changed was, you know, the removal of clutter or a fresh coat of neutral paint or, you know, there's just so many things that you don't know what buyers are thinking. I mean, I feel like I do. I've kind of devoted my life to it. But I feel like, you know, there's definitely ways that can make it make them make it appeal to them a lot more for sure. Yeah. And again, what I will ask our audience to do is take a chance on this on your next on your next listing. Contact Trisha if you go to lovelyhomes.com you'll see your services and she has a few consulting services. One is home staging, another one's interior design. You know, her home staging consultation is incredibly affordable. Go ahead and try it. Do it with her and see what happens to how, you know, the home, how the home performs. And also to how your clients look at you because you can say to them, I have a home stage of consultant that I work with. I'm going to video this entire property and I'm going to come back to you with a bunch of ideas. And again, you're going to see the value in this. And again, you don't have to be the expert. You don't have to know any of this stuff. This is what's this is what's so great about considering yourself a consultant. Consultants don't come in and immediately go, this is what we need to fix in your business or whatever kind of consult they go, they look around or they look at the business. They look, they do a lot of analysis and then they come back with a solution, right? Consultants come back. And so this idea is you don't have to know the answers right away. You just have to hem and haunt kind of go, hmm, that's interesting and take pictures and video go, okay, I'm going to take this back to my team. I'm going to come back to you in a week or a couple of days and we're going to get to work. That is an incredibly powerful, I mean, most agents don't do that. So yeah, absolutely. Absolutely. Absolutely. I mean, I think anything that can make you look like you have, you know, more knowledge in the area just makes you have a more professional image to your clients. I love it. Well, again, lovely homes.com is where you go forward slash free for her magazine that will really help sort of get you on the path of making the case about why home stage is important.

So I appreciate you Trisha, of course, for taking time to give away some of your give away some of the secrets to our audience. It's very much appreciated. And you are incredibly generous and kind. And again, I think this home stage and consultation or consulting business you have is just going to sky, if it's already probably skyrocketing, but I want to see it keep growing and growing because I just think it's a brilliant idea. And I want everybody to check it out. So on behalf of our audience, we all say thank you to Trisha for coming on and sharing her wisdom about how to, I mean, again, how to help how to help home so faster and for more money.
