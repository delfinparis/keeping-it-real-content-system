[00:03:34] My conversation with Jim Remly.
[00:03:49] Okay, today on the show, we really have a true Renaissance man. Jim Remly, I want to tell you,
[00:03:57] Jim is a very humble person, but I'm going to brag for him because what he has accomplished is
[00:04:02] nothing really short of remarkable. Not only has he been a top producer, it's also a brokerage owner,
[00:04:08] he is a recruiter, he is a podcast host, an author, an educator for National Association of REALTORS.
[00:04:15] This man does it all and we are so honored to have him on the show, but let me actually tell you more
[00:04:19] about Jim. So Jim Remly began his real estate, this is also incredible. He began his real estate
[00:04:24] career at 19 and quickly became a top performer, which nobody does at 19 except Jim. He ranked in the
[00:04:31] top 1% of REALTORS nationwide, which is insane. Within a year, he listed over 150 properties,
[00:04:39] and by the age of 24, he founded the largest independent real estate company in Oregon. Of course,
[00:04:45] he did growing it to 17 offices with his extensive experience. Jim became an instructor for the
[00:04:50] National Association of REALTORS and co-founded the luxury home council. He authored the accredited
[00:04:56] loan, sorry, the accredited luxury home specialist designation, ALSH, and three best selling books,
[00:05:03] including sell your home in any market. Jim's expertise has led to appearances on various television
[00:05:08] and radio programs, including CNN's open house. He currently leads one of Oregon's largest real
[00:05:14] estate firms, closing 3,000 transactions annually with a sales volume of over 1.4 billion
[00:05:20] and aims to help agents and brokers accelerate their performance. Jim also hosts the podcast
[00:05:26] eReal Estate Coach, where you can find wherever podcasts are served. So there's so many things about
[00:05:32] Jim. If you go into our description, we're going to have a link to his podcast, his coaching,
[00:05:37] and also his books on Amazon. But if you want to check out his coaching offering,
[00:05:42] eReal Estate Coach.com. And before we bring him on, if you are a REALTOR in the Southern
[00:05:47] Oregon area, and you would like to work with Jim, I know I would, if I live there, I would want to
[00:05:52] check out to see what Jim's brokerage offers. You can reach out to Jim directly. He is with John
[00:05:59] L. Scott, and he has a, that's his brokerage in Southern Oregon, and we'll give you his contact
[00:06:06] information, Charlie. Jim, welcome to the show. Well, thank you so much. That's quite an
[00:06:10] induction. I appreciate that. You've done quite a lot. And I am, I'm actually a little intimidated.
[00:06:18] So I appreciate a fellow podcast host and author and a National Association of REALTORS is our
[00:06:23] backyard here. So we can, I can appreciate that I have, I actually would like to serve at the
[00:06:31] at the national level. So I'm in the process of going through the ranks to hopefully get to help
[00:06:37] out in some way. But I would love to really learn more about you. First of all, starting
[00:06:43] a real estate career at 19 is, well, everyone listening knows that's not an easy thing. And tell
[00:06:49] us sort of why you did that and then how you became so successful so quickly. Well, as a college
[00:06:54] dropout, first of all, and I don't recommend that I can, my kids are, are required to go to college.
[00:06:59] So that I didn't, I was a terrible college student, barely graduate high school for that matter.
[00:07:05] But I went to work at a lumber mill in, in Roosevelt, Oregon where I grew up. It's the lumber
[00:07:11] camp level world. So anybody that doesn't go to college goes and works at a lumber mill. So I was
[00:07:16] working graveyard lumber mill. And I'll never forget one of the first nights I was coming down with
[00:07:20] graveyard shift. I was trying to go to college at the same time, didn't work out. But I was coming
[00:07:24] down the, the, the walkway and now these big lumber ponds. And there's always floating lumber. And
[00:07:34] up towards me to start the day shift and they're wearing jackets and they're proud of the jackets.
[00:07:38] And they should be hardworking guys. But the, the jackets have, um, little arm bands that say how
[00:07:44] long they've been there. And one guy was 20 years, 30 years, 25 years, one guy had 40 years. And I
[00:07:50] thought to myself, do I want to be doing this for 30, 50 years or 40 years? And I thought I've
[00:07:55] been to do something else. I had to do something else quickly. And so I pivoted and got my real
[00:07:59] sale license. And that was kind of my, a little bit of my origin story. I've always been entrepreneurial.
[00:08:04] I started my first business when I was 15, win clear, window cleaning.
[00:08:08] I love it. Yeah. And so, you know, I was, I was a hard worker at a young age, but I needed to
[00:08:15] channel that into something that would give me a way that I could, you know, leverage my talents
[00:08:22] when you don't have any money, which is where I wasn't that point in my life.
[00:08:26] Well, I mean, what 19 year old has, has anything really? I mean, I know I didn't. But passing the test
[00:08:33] is one thing because, you know, you could just be a good student and pass the test or, or,
[00:08:37] you know, particularly good at, you know, educational testing. But to actually then become successful
[00:08:43] at 19 and then by 24, you know, opening a firm, you know, how did you find clients when you were
[00:08:51] that young? I would assume that would be a bit of an uphill battle to convince people, hey,
[00:08:56] you know, let me sell your home at 19. Yeah. Well, and I just just to back up, step for anybody
[00:09:01] listening to this, that is younger. I was not a great test digger. I failed the first time. So,
[00:09:07] your test score on the, on the national and state exams has nothing to do with your success level.
[00:09:13] Thank goodness. I mean, I sometimes I have people coming, they say, I got 100% and I was like,
[00:09:20] you studied too much. Yeah, it's a great question. So when I was 19, you know, when I'm going out
[00:09:28] to interview for jobs, most of the people that I'm interviewing with are, you know, 30, 40, 50 years
[00:09:34] old and they look at me like, whoa, you know, I've got kids older than you. Why would I trust my
[00:09:38] largest financial assets in you? Then you barely can grow facial air. So my, my, the way I was able to
[00:09:46] sell myself is to come in more prepared than any other REALTOR. So I would really go all in on
[00:09:52] prep. And so I learned something a long time ago that for every one minute at prep,
[00:09:58] says four minutes of execution. So you gotta prepare really, really as if you're, you're going to
[00:10:04] get there every listing like this is, you're not just going from an appointment, you're getting the
[00:10:08] listing. And if you're getting the listing, why not just do all the work? So that means you know,
[00:10:12] all the county research, all the city research, all the zoning research, all the CCNARS, you're just
[00:10:17] going all in. You're going to know more about that property than the seller when you get there,
[00:10:20] right? And that would impress people, right? Sure. And then I would say, I would just, you know,
[00:10:25] you got to go out the aged thing head on up your young, right? Because the, the unsaid is worse
[00:10:30] than the, than the said, right? There's an old marketing principle called if you can't fix it,
[00:10:35] feature it. And this is what we're talking about. Yeah. One hundred percent. You take the
[00:10:38] sting out, right? And you're just going to deal with it right up front. So I would say, obviously,
[00:10:43] I'm younger than most people that you're interviewing, right? But can I tell you why that's an advantage?
[00:10:47] And everybody like, yeah, I told them that's, it's an advantage because I'm going to outwork every
[00:10:51] other interview. I'm going to give you all my attention, all my effort, all my energy, and I
[00:10:57] am completely open to critique. So if you don't like anything I'm doing, you tell me, I'll be the first
[00:11:01] to change it. But I guarantee you, you will get no one that will work harder than I am. And
[00:11:06] that listens to that has a kid or a grand kid. And they're like, I'm going to give the kid a shot.
[00:11:12] Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And I was, I didn't mean to stop either, but I was so impressed with that,
[00:11:17] because not only is that a nice thing to say, but you also had done the homework and it wasn't
[00:11:23] just like, hey, I'm going to outwork everyone. I'm going to show you right now how I've already,
[00:11:27] I mean, without saying that you've probably already outworked the other listing agents who might
[00:11:31] have come in to, you know, also bid on that, on that business. And so I love that it's backed up
[00:11:37] by action. And you're right is there is something about giving a young person a shot when they're
[00:11:43] eager, you know, they seem really authentic. And you sort of want to root for the underdog,
[00:11:49] right? We like rooting for underdogs. And I think young people have that, again, you're right,
[00:11:54] they address the issue head on, hey, here's why, you know, I don't have 40 clients that I'm dealing
[00:11:58] with right now. I have you. And I am going to, I need you to be happy because so I'm going to do
[00:12:04] whatever it takes. And you're going to tell me if there's anything I need to change. And I just,
[00:12:08] I love that. Well, that was just so perfectly said.
[00:12:11] One other spin on that too that I trained to now with agencies, you know, people can read
[00:12:16] confidence really quickly. And if you come in and you're not confident, it makes everyone
[00:12:20] uncomfortable really fast. It does. It's like, look at out of your spas as possible. So,
[00:12:26] and so the question mark is how do I build confidence for young people for every age, so it's
[00:12:31] just young people. And the way you build confidence is through competence. Correct. And the way
[00:12:36] competence is built is through rehearsal, practice syndrome, reperson, practice drill.
[00:12:41] And the great book outliers by Malcolm Gladwell, he talks about, you know, the 10,000 hour role that
[00:12:47] every master, whether it's a musician, artist, a writer, you know, some of the in sports,
[00:12:53] they bought across the 10,000 hour threshold. So if we relate that to real estate, and we say,
[00:12:57] well, how much of I really truly honestly practice my listing presentation?
[00:13:01] By practice to five hours, my practice of 10,000, certainly not 10,000 hours, but if I
[00:13:06] practice it, a hundred hours this year, probably not. So if you have this expectation, you're going
[00:13:11] to make a million dollars this year, and you're not putting the time in to be a master, you've got
[00:13:16] to disconnect there. You want to be the master, you got to, you got to act like a master, you got to
[00:13:20] go all in. Yeah, I agree. It's it's very akin to getting physically fit, which, you know, there's
[00:13:26] a visual component to getting physically fit. And but the work that it take, there's only really
[00:13:31] one way to do it through hard work. I guess you could get implants surgically inserted, which
[00:13:35] are the facade of muscles. But if you really want actual muscles, you have to be willing to put
[00:13:40] yourself, you have to be willing to give, you know, that 10,000 hours in the gym, the Beatles,
[00:13:45] which which are talked about in outliers, the book are really the perfect example of this, because
[00:13:50] before they ever recorded their first album, they had 10,000 hours of live studio or live performance
[00:13:57] because a time because they were playing in Germany for eight to 12 hours at a time. And so they
[00:14:04] just got that good. They knew, they knew like 500 songs by that. But it really was their sort of,
[00:14:10] you know, incubation period too. And obviously we know, we know what they accomplished. And so many
[00:14:14] others are in that same category of, you know, output. But you're right, it's all about practice.
[00:14:20] It's it's like, I guess if I, if I was wanting to go to a listing presentation and it was a
[00:14:26] luxury property, for example, I would probably need to put in a bunch of time on my own to perfect
[00:14:32] that presentation, run it by a bunch of people, record myself doing it, and then make lots of
[00:14:37] modifications over and over and over and over again until until it didn't sound like a presentation,
[00:14:42] I guess. But, but you're right, it's all it's all about the practice and the work. And the good
[00:14:47] news too is 10,000 hours is a pretty daunting number. It's almost like an un not conceivable number.
[00:14:53] But if you just chip away at it, you know, a little bit every day, you know, you put an hour
[00:14:57] in a day of studying the MLS and your chosen market or whatever skill you want to develop.
[00:15:03] Within a year, you probably are going to be on the right track. You're probably going to be like,
[00:15:07] wow, I just know a whole lot. I'm a big, big believer of this. You do so many, so many things,
[00:15:14] you're brokerage owner, you're a top producer, and of course, instructor and a coach now.
[00:15:20] Where do you see just because I want to jive into the coaching? So so much. And by the way, again,
[00:15:25] gyms, coaching website is erealestatecoach.com. You has all sorts of different programs and services
[00:15:31] for agents, specifically a lot around recruiting too, which I don't see that much of. So maybe you're
[00:15:37] a team and you're looking to recruit more agents or maybe you're a brokerage owner. We have a lot of
[00:15:41] brokerage owners that listen and you're like me, I'm a recruiter. That's what I do. So I'm interested
[00:15:45] in learning from gym two. But before we get to the recruiting stuff, let's talk about just
[00:15:49] keeping agents productive right now. You know, it's obviously not the easiest time to be a real
[00:15:55] tour. I would guess we have the NAR lawsuits. We've got buyer agency changing, although I don't,
[00:16:00] actually we could we could talk just briefly about buyer agency. But I'm curious to what your
[00:16:04] coaching agents to do today to stay productive, even though rates aren't exactly where we want them
[00:16:10] to be. Inventory is probably not exactly where we want it to be, but we still have to keep working.
[00:16:14] So how are you keeping your agents working and productive? Well, there's a magic number in
[00:16:20] the real estate industry that you know, you have to embrace it if you're going to be successful.
[00:16:25] And I learned this pretty early. And that is that your success as an agent is relative to what I
[00:16:30] call Q2. And Q2 is the quantity and quality of your database, your sphere of influence. And we
[00:16:35] hear it all the time. But NAR studies this. It's not like it's a you know, some mystical tank.
[00:16:43] This is truth. And so the latest study shows that 69% of sellers found their agent from
[00:16:48] referral. 61% of buyers found their agents are referral. So the first thing we have to do is
[00:16:53] agencies accept that and say, okay, number one, before I go chasing rabbits and chasing down all
[00:16:59] these internet things that people are selling me. The first thing I got to do is fix my sphere.
[00:17:04] And then I got to say, is my sphere completely dialed in? Number one. And then I need to understand
[00:17:09] the path is in the math. The numbers are what's going to drive your business, nothing else.
[00:17:15] So the numbers are very simple. So if I want to close X number transactions, I take that number
[00:17:20] times 10. It tells me the exact number of people I need my sphere of influence. I want to close
[00:17:23] 30 transactions. I need 300 people. Then everybody has a gap number. That's the number you have now.
[00:17:28] The difference between what you want, what you have now is your gap. And you got to fill that gap
[00:17:32] as fast as you can when you possible. And then beyond that, I've got to create a 20 to 50 touch
[00:17:39] point matrix on how I'm going to touch these people for the course of year of a state top of mind.
[00:17:43] Yeah. Now some of you that are older, like me, that I've been in business 35 years,
[00:17:47] that number used to be 9 to 12 times year. Now it's 20 to 50 times year because every American is
[00:17:53] hearing minimum of 5,000 advertising matches is a day. So we have to cut through the communication
[00:17:59] jungle to stay top of mind. And what's nice about what we're talking about is deepening the
[00:18:05] relationships, deepening the connections we have with our sphere because the numbers are on our
[00:18:10] side. When we do that, as Jim said, you know, nearly seven out of every 10 people choose a REALTOR
[00:18:15] either from someone they have already worked with in the past or a referral from somebody who said,
[00:18:19] you got to work with my buddy, you know, here she is the greatest. So this is where I think the
[00:18:25] really fun part about being a REALTOR comes in because you can control all of the touch points,
[00:18:29] like you can set up systems and we've had episodes on this where, you know, you don't, if you're
[00:18:35] having to talk to touch somebody 20 to 50 times a year, you're certainly not calling them 20 to 50
[00:18:40] times going, hey, are you ready to sell your home? Obviously, we're not talking about that. We're
[00:18:43] talking about ways to provide value, ways to just stay front of mind or back of mind. And there's
[00:18:49] lots of fun ways to do that. You know, the traditional path would be email newsletters and, you know,
[00:18:54] client appreciation events and all sorts of, you know, sending out updated comps and celebrating
[00:19:00] somebody on their home anniversary and all of these things that were like, yeah, I should do that.
[00:19:04] But also too, now with social media, we have the ability to see what our clients are doing in their
[00:19:10] personal lives. And if we're connected with them on LinkedIn, we can see what they're doing in
[00:19:15] their professional lives. And we can actually take some notes and say like, oh, hey, I saw so and so,
[00:19:19] just got a promotion at work or I saw something for the company this person works. I just had a big
[00:19:25] news story. I'm going to, that's a touch point. I'm going to reach out to be like, hey, I just
[00:19:28] saw you got a promotion. You're crushing it. Keep, you know, it's, to me, it's all about building
[00:19:32] intimacy as, as best as possible, which is really a lot of effort because you have to go through and
[00:19:38] pay attention to what's going on in your clients and your spheres lives. And I'm curious to get some
[00:19:44] suggestions about how you might encourage people to get their sphere in order so that they can get
[00:19:49] more of that 69 percent. Yeah. Well, I think you're exactly right. I mean, I coach people that are
[00:19:56] in, you know, doing 50, 60, 70, 80 million dollars a year, 100 million dollars a year. And when you
[00:20:01] talk to them, and for any of the time, what happens is every single time with all these top producers,
[00:20:06] they will say, hey, I just, just to my friend's house, or I just saw my buddy house, they don't look
[00:20:11] at their clients as transactional units on a spreadsheet. And this is a difference.
[00:20:18] Week agents look at their clients as transactional units on a spreadsheet. Strong agents, the
[00:20:22] strongest agents in America look at their clients as relationships. And they look at this as
[00:20:28] friends and friends refer friends. This is a, this is an ultimate aspect of our sphere that most
[00:20:35] people messes your job is to move people up the ladder of friendship. So they start as an
[00:20:41] acquaintance to meet an open house. And you want to just try to bubble that relationship up to a
[00:20:46] point where they look at you as, hey, Jim's a friend of mine. And I refer friends to friends. That's
[00:20:51] the ultimate goal. So how do you get there? Right? So the way you're going to get there is through
[00:20:56] communication. And then communication is going to look like not always trying to sell them something
[00:21:02] there. It gets on the out of it. Right? So the, in the great book, GoGibber by Bob Burry. Great.
[00:21:07] We'll look about this kind of concept. I'm just going to give you a couple examples. Number one,
[00:21:13] is understanding at all of your clients is aspirational goals. So if I was talking to you, I'd say,
[00:21:17] hey, man, tell me what, what do you want to get done in the next six months to a year? What do you,
[00:21:20] your big goals? And you're going to tell me something, right? I want to open a bakery. I want to go
[00:21:24] to Hawaii, whatever it happens to be. And then I'm going to say, oh, okay, now I'm going to be on
[00:21:28] the watch for that. And if I can help you with that, oh, I found a great article on, on opening the
[00:21:33] big, I love that. I've been to Hawaii. I just had this happen, by the way, for my honeymoon,
[00:21:39] I got married six years ago. One of my agents heard that we're going to Maui. He bought me a book,
[00:21:44] Scott Lewis, if he's listening to this, a ninja, amazing agent, top racing agent. He buys me a
[00:21:49] book about Maui and marks in the book those favorite places that he went in Maui. Oh, that's great.
[00:21:54] These are the kinds of things that elevate relationships to friendships, right? And when you stop
[00:21:59] thinking about how many referrals can I pull out of this, you know, that's not the way that
[00:22:03] top agents operate. Top agents operate a whole different mindset. Now, you need to put some
[00:22:08] numbers behind it. Here's one thing I look at it as I say, what's my students is you want to go big
[00:22:13] and go small every day. Let me give you an example. Sure. Going big is I'm going to do something that
[00:22:19] touches a large group of people every single day. So that could be my email newsletter, right?
[00:22:24] It could be that I'm doing a social media post, right? Something big. It could be I'm doing a
[00:22:29] voice mail drop to every single person on my database. Something big. And then I'm going to go small.
[00:22:35] Going small means I'm going to have personal interactions with a, we put a number behind it,
[00:22:40] and it's very specific, 10 people a day. And I'm going to have a phone call, a text, a direct message
[00:22:46] where I'm going to be physically talking to somebody 10 times a day, right? And that might look
[00:22:51] differently, like your examples of using, you know, social media as your own CRM, looking for
[00:22:57] life change and having comments about that. All great. But let me tell you that the secret weapon
[00:23:02] I see with top, top, top agents, the secret weapon and it's the least expensive, most effective,
[00:23:11] and kind of undercover prospecting is networking. And networking just means I am breaking bread with
[00:23:19] people or having lunch, coffee, dinner, drinks with somebody three times a week, minimum. If I'm doing
[00:23:27] that three times a week with people in my spirit of influence, your business will explode. There is
[00:23:32] no way you won't explode. Now in the meetings, do I have to talk about real estate? No, I don't.
[00:23:38] Real estate will come up because you are in real estate, but you want to sit there and talk real
[00:23:42] estate all the time. You're just going to talk and you're going to create friendships and relationships
[00:23:45] with people. I'm telling you guys, that is the most effective way to lead generate is networking,
[00:23:51] networking, networking. So here's my goal and I'll just give you a quick model and I know I'm talking
[00:23:55] a lot of time, but my goal is to solve perfect. My quick model for success with the agents is the 4-1-1-1 strategy.
[00:24:01] You're going to spend one hour a day in lead gen, primarily focused on your sphere of influence.
[00:24:06] But I'm going to add one more pipeline to whether it's Fisbo's expires, absentee, or something else.
[00:24:11] 20% of my time there are 80% of my time on sphere. One hour a day on lead gen, my goal of that
[00:24:16] hours is to set one appointment with a seller, a buyer, or a sphere member. Spere member is just as valuable
[00:24:22] as a buyer of seller meeting. Because I'm setting one appointment, I'm going on one appointment
[00:24:26] today. And then the most important thing that every agent needs to do every day is add one new person
[00:24:33] to the sphere of each single day. So that's what we call our perfect model.
[00:24:38] Yeah, it's a great point because if you do add one person a day, let's just, I don't know how many
[00:24:43] business days there are in the year, 220, something, something like that. So you're adding 200 plus
[00:24:49] people to your day. If you could add 200 plus people to your database, which is essentially meeting
[00:24:53] one person every weekday, roughly, and getting their information, of course, and putting it in your
[00:24:59] CRM and then working, and then as Jim said, you know, developing a communication strategy,
[00:25:04] like, how am I going to touch this person 20 to 50 times over the next 12 months? And then you're
[00:25:08] just literally running running the process, right? It's, it's okay. Today, I'm going to check out
[00:25:13] their social media tomorrow. I'm going to invite them to lunch or, you know, whatever the process is,
[00:25:17] every quarter, I'm going to, you know, reach out to them by telephone every once a year. I'll do a
[00:25:22] sit down, whatever. There's lots of ways to do this. We're not, we obviously, there's no one size fits
[00:25:27] all, but this is, I think the biggest missing piece that REALTORS oftentimes fall out of that habit
[00:25:34] of adding people to their database because they get caught up with all the to-do's of the day. They
[00:25:39] have clients they need to service. And of course, you know, when we know when we're dealing with
[00:25:44] transactions, things just fly at us at any given time and they really require a lot of times,
[00:25:50] our immediate attention and it takes us out of building the business. I'm working now in the business
[00:25:55] as opposed to on the business. I wanted to ask you, Jim, too. It's been really interesting. So,
[00:26:01] of course, I know everybody is sick of hearing about buyer agency representation. I got it. We're
[00:26:06] not going to have a big conversation about that. Hopefully, everybody has received some training
[00:26:09] from their brokerage or from their association about how to proceed in a way that's, you know,
[00:26:16] sort of mindful and authentic and certainly, you know, compliant. So we're not going to talk too
[00:26:22] much about this, but I wanted to ask your opinion as a coach because on this show, I talked to top
[00:26:27] 1% producers and I've asked every one of them, has this impacted your business? Now, obviously,
[00:26:32] we haven't seen a lot of 0% co-ops at least here in Chicago yet, but we are going to start seeing
[00:26:38] those. It will happen. People will have to deal with it and buyer representation is changing. Okay.
[00:26:43] Well, it isn't really changing. It's just being a lot more specific now. I'd say I'd argue that
[00:26:48] it really isn't changed. It's just more transparent, which I think is a good thing. But certainly a more
[00:26:53] difficult thing to explain as in the past, maybe the reason why we're in this situation is it wasn't
[00:26:58] explained well before, but now we do have to explain it and we should. I have found that talking
[00:27:06] to all these top agents, not one of the people I've talked to was worried about it. And so, I'm curious
[00:27:11] to get your thoughts on it. For anyone out there who's nervous about saying, gosh, I'm going to have
[00:27:16] to tell my buyers they might have to pony up. That's a tricky thing. Just curious on your thoughts
[00:27:22] about that altogether. That's a great question. I actually taught the ABR class for 10 years for NAR.
[00:27:28] So I was pretty versed in that. I've been teaching just in the last six months a class called the
[00:27:33] buyer representation mastery course across the country for brokerageism and boards. So it's a great
[00:27:39] topic. I think when you're seeing with top agents is that a lot of top agents have already
[00:27:45] adopted a standard of I'm only working with loyal buyers that are either under contract or would
[00:27:52] have no problem signing a contract. Right. Now that we're going to have to all be under contract.
[00:27:57] I think the scary point for agents that are maybe not used to having the confidence level that
[00:28:04] some of these top agents have is the biggest fear point is that is the commission conversation.
[00:28:10] Like how do I explain the commission to a buyer in a way that doesn't creep them out?
[00:28:15] Right. So number one and I'm telling all my students this you got three things you need to have
[00:28:21] right now. And I don't wait to August like today. You need to have a number one of buyer
[00:28:26] presentations just like a cell presentation. You should already build that right. We've got a 12 step
[00:28:31] it's 12 points that we believe she's going to buy a presentation. But that buyer presentations
[00:28:35] should have proprietary value built in. In other words, you can't just be doing what every other
[00:28:40] role she's doing. You got to actually have some reasons why I'm going to use you as opposed to
[00:28:44] the other 10,000 agents in this market. So proprietary value unique sign propositions are so important.
[00:28:50] I can give you a few if you want to go to the slide. An example would be you know the misconception.
[00:28:56] Like if you're going tick tock and you start talking about buyer representation like I have
[00:28:59] you get all the trolls pile on to you and they'll say why would I pay an age of 10 grand or 20 grand
[00:29:05] open a door for me. I can do that myself. Why would I pay an age of that kind of money to search
[00:29:10] for homes. I can do that for myself. And you know what? We need to listen to what's being said there
[00:29:17] because that's the perception that buyers have of us. So what are we going to do about that? I'll
[00:29:23] get you an example. So in on my buyer presentation obviously when you on the flip side of that when
[00:29:28] NA are does studies of buyers and I say what's the most valuable thing a buyer's age can bring to you.
[00:29:33] Number one is helping them find the right home. It's been number one for 20 years. It's always been
[00:29:37] number one. As long as I've been teaching it's been number one. So we have an economy here. We
[00:29:42] got to solve this. So here's the way I'm going to solve this. I'm going to give it two strategies.
[00:29:47] When I'm sitting with you I'm going to say so obviously one of the services I'm going to provide to
[00:29:50] you is helping you find the right property to purchase. Now a lot of people will just plug you into an
[00:29:56] MLS system or you know you could plug yourself into Road to a Conver Zillow and you can just get a
[00:30:01] stream of properties coming to you. Every agent can do that. But here's what I'm going to do. Now I'm
[00:30:05] going to add proprietary value. I'm going to add some unit. I'm going to hand curate every listing that
[00:30:10] sent you. So what that means is that I'm going to get a copy of every listing sent to you. And I'm
[00:30:15] going to tell you my thoughts on every property that's sent when you should look at it or not.
[00:30:20] Now you might say Jim that sounds like a lot of work. I'm going to the 50% of the agents in America
[00:30:26] have closed two deals last year. Less than two deals. When you tell them you can't handle this. That's BS.
[00:30:32] You can handle this. It's not like the end of the world. If you want to start closing you get to
[00:30:35] 50 transactions. Let's talk about the work involved. But you're not closing enough transactions for most
[00:30:39] of you. Well and at that point you hire somebody to do the other things that are taking up your time.
[00:30:43] Right. Exactly. And then then I go into the no stone on turn conversation. The no stone on turn
[00:30:48] conversations. Listen, here's the reality. We're in a low supply market when we have been for
[00:30:53] last 10 years. And what that means is a lot of the best listings ever hit the market. They never hit
[00:30:58] them on us. So my job really is to go way deeper than I'm lost. You're going to get the
[00:31:02] I'm lost up for sure. And I'm going to give you my care pin hand curation on that. But I'm also
[00:31:07] going to be looking at coming soon listings by networking with the top 10% agents in the
[00:31:11] make than the market that do a 9% of the business. I'm going to look at for sell by apps. I'm going
[00:31:14] to look at expire listings. I'm going to dive into neighborhoods that you're interested in. And if
[00:31:19] you want to either reach out and canvas that neighborhood and I'll shake loose. But it's thinking
[00:31:23] about now that's that's a real I'm only spasking you because this is a super cool idea. I'm so sorry,
[00:31:29] Jim. I want to Jim is saying something that is gold right now because I just want to make sure
[00:31:34] we pause for a moment to really get this idea out there. It's very wrapped on almost 600 episodes
[00:31:40] here. And this is really the one of the first times this particular idea has has been brought up.
[00:31:44] So what Jim's talking about is you know, you have a buyer and you know that buyer wants to live in
[00:31:50] a particular subdivision neighborhood community wherever. And you could in theory print up little
[00:31:57] flyers or something something of value to deliver to the homes in that area saying, Hey, I know your
[00:32:04] homes not on the market. I have a buyer that desperately wants to move into this area. Well,
[00:32:08] you would probably say desperately, but you know, you would say I have a I work with people who
[00:32:11] want to move in this area. If you would or you know, or ever think I'm not doing a good job of this.
[00:32:16] But we get the idea you can go out and look for listings as a buyer's agent. 100% and that's it's
[00:32:23] pure gold to do that. I mean, we go to the stats around that and how successful that is.
[00:32:28] But it absolutely works 100% live buyer prospecting is the best prospecting on earth when you're doing
[00:32:35] cold or warm kind of prospecting. But let me do the third thing we can't go through all 12. But the
[00:32:40] third thing I'm going to talk about in the buyer presentation, which is proprietary value as well,
[00:32:45] is I want to put a bright line here and I want to say, but finding the home is the easy part.
[00:32:50] Because they perceive it's the easy part anyway. It's not really easy. They have Zillow. Yes, they
[00:32:54] think it is. They perceive it to be easy. So I'm going to say finding the home is the easy part.
[00:32:58] The hard part for me is your agent is when we find the home you want to buy because that's what my
[00:33:02] work really begins. Here's what I'm going to do for you. And this is what I get into what my
[00:33:06] presentation is called deep research. So I'm going to do deep research on every property. This
[00:33:11] means I'm going to go to the county, pull all the permits that have been pulled on that property.
[00:33:15] I'm going to look at the zoning. I'm going to look at the overlays for the property. I'm going to
[00:33:18] get the disclosures taken and go through that with the fine tooth comb. I'm going to tell you what
[00:33:22] to sell or pay for the property. The last time they refinanced the property, I'm going to even talk
[00:33:27] to the neighbors on either side of the property, ask them what they know about the neighborhood.
[00:33:31] If they like the neighborhood, what don't they like the neighborhood. And if they know anything
[00:33:34] about the house, at least you know. By the time I'm done, you're going to know more about that
[00:33:37] house than the seller knows about that. Now, but as I'm going and I can go on and on and on,
[00:33:42] I'm going to show you neighborhood trends and nails. But I'm going to create a situation where
[00:33:47] I'm a category of one. There is no one that is going to come to them and give them the level of
[00:33:53] value I'm delivering. And they're going to know it in about 10 minutes of being with me.
[00:33:58] So now I'm going to eventually get down to how I'm compensated. I'm going to get down to the
[00:34:03] compensation question, which is the big fear point. That doesn't have to be fearful, guys. It can be so
[00:34:09] so easy and so seamless. It's all in your confidence level, which is built by confidence,
[00:34:15] which is built by rehearsal drill practice. So what I'm going to say is, hey guys,
[00:34:19] now how am I paid? I'm paid fee and my fee is x, but it's a success fee. And this is the key
[00:34:26] language. It's a success. Love that. Yes. And the success fee just means that you will not pay me a
[00:34:31] nickel, a dime, a penny. Unless you find the perfect home for you, we negotiate the best price
[00:34:38] that you're comfortable with. We get your financing or we go through all the appraisals, the
[00:34:42] inspections, the home gets underrided. You get everything you want in that house. We get all
[00:34:46] the way to closing your hand of the keys. That's when I'm paid. I'm not paid a dime. You don't close.
[00:34:52] So don't think you're there's some kind of hourly clock ticking. I'm not like a taxi. And here's
[00:34:57] what's going to happen. My fee, I'm going to try to get as much of my fee from the sellers possible.
[00:35:03] So what we write it on for, I'm going to ask the seller to pay all or most of that fee on your
[00:35:07] app. Now some sellers will agree, some sellers won't agree. And that's a negotiation. But this
[00:35:13] is going to be completely transparent. You're going to know exactly what you're getting into it. Every
[00:35:16] transaction you have the power to say no, I can't afford to do it, or I don't want to do it
[00:35:21] in every transaction. And here's what I'm going to recommend to all the agents that are listening.
[00:35:25] For most strong agents, when you have a listing a seller and you have an offer coming in, a lot
[00:35:31] of us do a net sheet. And we say, hey, here's what you're going to net. We have our little estimate
[00:35:36] calculator. Maybe we pulled from the title company app or the title company's doing it for us.
[00:35:40] And we say, what based on this offer you get X, we're going to start doing the same thing with
[00:35:43] buyers guys. We're going to say based on the offer that we've negotiated, here's what it would cost
[00:35:47] you a closing, which includes your down payment. It's great. Closing costs, my fees, everything else,
[00:35:53] so I can go on and on and on about this conversation, but that's kind of the way we work.
[00:35:57] I do also am curious to get your thoughts. If somebody says, well, I understand now that buyers are
[00:36:02] now paying and whatever they may read a story online, and they're not probably going to understand
[00:36:08] the full history of it. But I think it's really important to, I would love to get your thoughts,
[00:36:17] because you may have a different opinion. But if somebody says, well, hey, okay,
[00:36:22] it seems like I'm paying a new fee last time I didn't have to pay a fee. And last time I bought a
[00:36:27] home, I didn't cut a check to anyone. Well, actually, and that's where you could bring some data in
[00:36:33] and say, let me tell you about how the system was set up, how it worked, and you actually did pay
[00:36:39] fees. They weren't really easily disclosed or transparent. You weren't technically cutting a
[00:36:45] check. However, if we just sort of think about economics and traditional supply and demand,
[00:36:51] like it's built in to the price or, you know, anyway, and again, I'm not a practicing REALTOR,
[00:36:56] so forgive me for not saying that in the right appropriate way. But we understand that this is,
[00:37:01] we're now just bringing something a little bit more to the forefront. Yes, there's technically a
[00:37:06] step where they may have to write a check these days. They didn't have to do that before, but they
[00:37:10] were paying that one way or the other. And now they're just paying it more on the front end,
[00:37:13] versus having wrapping it into the mortgage or however it was, it wasn't really wrapped into
[00:37:18] the mortgage. It was part of the price. But it can make the strong argument that the fees have been
[00:37:23] paid this whole time, and it was just not super clear who was paying or how the fees were being paid.
[00:37:29] Yeah, I agree. And the way we, you know, the way I explained it on the seller side of the fence,
[00:37:35] which is as important to this whole conversation too, is to say, let me ask you, when you bought the house
[00:37:41] that you own now, did you write a check to your buyer's agent or to the seller paper that on your
[00:37:46] half? And they'll always be like, well, the seller runs the check. Okay, and can I tell you why that
[00:37:52] happened? And they'll say, oh, well, yeah, I'll tell you why it happened because what happens is you
[00:37:58] paid the seller's price and that price paid for the seller's representation and your representation.
[00:38:04] But what it allowed you to do is something very special. It allowed you to finance the
[00:38:10] representation costs in the transaction over 30 years, which is what most buyers prefer to do.
[00:38:15] Sure. Of course. What I recommend that we still offer by-raging compensation. And we can't do
[00:38:21] it in MLS, but we can certainly do it when people call us. And I recommend it because you're going to
[00:38:25] open up the buyer pool. The study's right now or that 30 to 50 percent of the buyers in the market
[00:38:30] can't afford to write through each and such. Right. So if we don't give them a way to finance
[00:38:34] this transaction cost, what's going to happen is you're in a 30 to 50 percent of your buyer pool,
[00:38:40] which most of us don't want to lose. It's going to cost you money. And we don't want to do that.
[00:38:43] And most people can explain that by their account. Okay. I'll give it.
[00:38:47] I'm also curious too, as another option, if there's going to be a way that lenders can kind of come
[00:38:54] to the rescue here and create a commission loan or a source where it can be financed. Maybe it's
[00:39:01] its own loan with its own rate. I mean, I don't know why banks wouldn't want to do that. I don't
[00:39:05] know about the compliance associated there. I know it hasn't. I don't think it's been done yet by
[00:39:09] any lender, but I would hope that there is going to be something to help out those those home buyers
[00:39:14] who are now. Oh gosh, now I need to come up with another 10 grand, right. And again, we're not
[00:39:20] seeing a lot of that today. But of course, there are going to be sellers who are going to start testing
[00:39:26] the waters to see if they don't have to pay out of pocket for the buyer fees. So I'll be curious.
[00:39:32] Do you do you obviously nobody has a crystal ball, but do you have a think that lenders could
[00:39:36] possibly come up with a solution to this or do or we're not sure yet? 100% I think my guess would
[00:39:42] be that Fannie and Freddie will roll out of a way that they can that buyers can finance
[00:39:48] the buyer closing costs. And this is this is just a part of your closing costs. I mean,
[00:39:52] the way to look at it. So I absolutely think that will happen. I wish it would have happened
[00:39:57] before any of our made the settlement. So it's easier. But I would my personal guess is that yes,
[00:40:07] that will happen. Well, I want to switch gears. Thank you for that that opinion. I want to switch
[00:40:13] gears because one of the things we don't ever talk about rarely talk about on the show is recruiting
[00:40:17] agents and as teams have become more and more significant over the last well ever since I've been
[00:40:24] in this industry 14 years, I've slowly seen the rise of teams for a lot of different reasons. And
[00:40:30] you know, also brokerages are always looking to attract agents teams are always looking to attract
[00:40:34] agents or maybe somebody's listening wants to develop a team. I know that this is a big passion of
[00:40:40] yours is some best practices around attraction versus like chasing, right? So how does one think
[00:40:46] about attracting a producing agent to their team or to partner up with or to join their brokerage
[00:40:53] because we know that agents get recruiting calls all day long every you know, every week from
[00:40:58] every firm that that's out there every firm is always recruiting pretty much. So they're getting
[00:41:02] a lot of these calls. And how do you sort of cut through the noise to actually get to to a good
[00:41:08] size producers, you know, sort of get on their radar so that you can actually cut through the
[00:41:14] other five calls they got that week about recruiting? Well, here's what let me tell you what
[00:41:19] what offices and team leaders should not do first and they should not focus on commission.
[00:41:25] And this is the number one trap and the number one mistake that brokerage owners and team leaders
[00:41:30] make is they think, well, if I just offer the lowest commission then lowest caps, you know,
[00:41:38] I'm going to track all the agents in my market and it's just absolutely not true. And the reason
[00:41:43] it's not true is because as soon as you go to five dollars, some of the markets are going to come
[00:41:47] before dollars and then you're going to raise to the bottom. And what has to happen in order for
[00:41:52] you to have that low cost structure is you end up having to cut services. So you're going to cut
[00:41:57] services and basically you're just giving people an umbrella to work under and you know, you're
[00:42:02] offering zero value. In fact, what I'm saying with some of the most successful offices and brokerage
[00:42:07] leaders and team leaders in the country dying is going to complete reverse of that. And they are
[00:42:12] saying, what's build out again, when I say this word for proprietary, but it's important is for
[00:42:17] proprietary value that makes me unique in the marketplace that is actually my value proposition.
[00:42:22] So if you're a broker, Joe, or a team leader listening, if you were to take out a piece of paper
[00:42:27] and write down what are the five reasons why someone should come to work for me? Five things I
[00:42:30] do differently or better than anyone else in the market. What would those be? And when you actually
[00:42:35] ask people that, most people don't have an answer to that. And so it can't just be a cult of
[00:42:40] personality. It can't be just thinking, I'm so great that everybody's going to come to work for me.
[00:42:45] Yes, people have to like you 100%. But beyond liking you, there has to be actual value behind coming
[00:42:52] to work for you. The only reason when people call me and say, Jim West, I can work for you, my answer
[00:42:57] that is always the same. There's only two reasons you should come to work for me. A, I can help you
[00:43:01] make more money or be I can make your life easier. I know that I can do both, but I need 20 minutes
[00:43:05] your time to show you. Now, so what it's about is it's about the number of transactions closed.
[00:43:13] So I've got a proof to you that I can help you close more transactions now or with me then you're
[00:43:18] closing down. That's it. So that is our whole focus of our presentation when we're talking to people
[00:43:24] is let me show you how I think we can help you close more transactions and make your life easier
[00:43:28] because work life balance for agents is super important, especially at a high level.
[00:43:32] Time control is super important and people have this desire that I don't want to kill myself working.
[00:43:37] I want to enjoy the money I'm making. So all of that plays as a factor in your recruiting
[00:43:41] presentation, your recruiting approach. Yeah, I agree. It's, you know, we're we're a perfect
[00:43:48] example of what you were talking about because when we started, when my boss started the our brokerage,
[00:43:53] we were a one person company at that time and I came on board a few years after it started and
[00:43:59] we had to recruit agents and when you're a two person, three person brokerage, you're just don't have
[00:44:04] a lot or we didn't have a lot to offer. Maybe there are smaller brokerages that have a lot to offer.
[00:44:08] We did not. And so we went the cost way, we are the cost savings way. We went highest commissions,
[00:44:14] lowest fees because that was we thought our only trump card and it worked to build us hundreds and
[00:44:19] hundreds and hundreds of agents. However, we weren't really attracting top producers. We were
[00:44:23] attracting great agents, whether they're part time or full time, but we weren't attracting the
[00:44:28] really massive producers. And the reason is because what we learned 10 years in, oh, they don't,
[00:44:36] top producers don't care about giving away 10, 15, 20% of their income if they're getting some
[00:44:42] other needs met by their brokerage, making their life easier as Jim said or increasing production.
[00:44:47] So they're happy to give away 10, 20, maybe even 30% of their commission if these other
[00:44:54] these other things are being solved. So I like that. And I'm curious to, so you know, if you want,
[00:45:00] if I want to recruit somebody to my team, I have to figure out first what my value prop, what is my
[00:45:06] true value proposition? Why not just, you know, if I say I can help you grow your production,
[00:45:12] I better be able to explain in detail how that is actually going to manifest as well as
[00:45:17] saving somebody time or solving some pain point. I better have an answer for that. And I think
[00:45:22] that's where practice comes in as you were saying, but also just really getting clear on why somebody
[00:45:29] needs to join you and then find, just find out what their pain point is and give them a solution.
[00:45:33] Yeah. And the way you have to look at it is I look at it as we're NFL coaches, we're NBA owners
[00:45:39] of our organization. And when you're doing a high level recruiting, high level recruiting is
[00:45:45] different than recruiting new agents. And so this is a whole, there's like a bright line in the sand.
[00:45:50] New agents are excited to come to work. They'll come to work for anybody anytime you can
[00:45:54] recruit them in an hour, right? They're just so excited. And I'm, I mean, facetious, but you know,
[00:45:59] it's easy to recruit new agents. Correct. It's much, much, much more difficult to recruit experience
[00:46:03] agents. But here's the problem with recruiting new agents is that there's an 87% nutrition rate.
[00:46:07] Right. So over the first two years, you have lose 87% of them. No matter how good your training is,
[00:46:11] no matter how good your mentorship and they take the most amount of effort and time and energy
[00:46:17] and from you as a broker, John, I'll lead her. I've got to completely let go of that. And I
[00:46:22] guys say, new agent recruiting is not wrong at I'm going after experience agents. And that's going
[00:46:27] to totally transform my company. If I just really go after that, the question is now, how do I do it?
[00:46:32] We have a seven step plan for doing it. That's very specific. But here's the thing. When you
[00:46:40] nine times out of a hundred, when you say, Hey, I'd love to do a recruiting presentation with you.
[00:46:45] I'm happy. I'm good. Where I am. Thanks. Exactly. It's not going anywhere. They're like, okay,
[00:46:49] no, thanks. Right. So here's the thing is that everybody's happy till they're not. So this is a
[00:46:54] really important thing to think about. So, but we've all seen people in our markets the last year that
[00:47:00] have moved. And you're like, damn, they moved. They didn't even come talk to me. They didn't even
[00:47:03] pick up the phone to have a conversation with me. Here's why they didn't do that because you didn't
[00:47:08] open the door. And so it's not about you going in for the throat like you would do with a new agent.
[00:47:13] It's about you building a relationship with them so that they know the doors open if and when
[00:47:17] they decide to raise their hand and say, I'm not happy because what happens is they're completely
[00:47:22] happy on Friday on Monday. They're pissed because the broker's career mover, the technology failed. They
[00:47:28] have a bad interaction with a staff member, somebody else in the office career mover. There's something
[00:47:33] went wrong. And now they go to the people that have opened the doors and then it's said, we want
[00:47:37] you. So what I have to do is I have to identify a target audience on my market, call 3, 4, 500
[00:47:42] agents that you love to have. Then I need to open doors with all of them. And that's as simple as
[00:47:46] letting them know why they're why you're attracted to them as an agent. So it might be to say,
[00:47:51] John, Jim, Bob, Susan, I just want to say I was talking to one of our agents this morning. I know
[00:47:58] you're in transaction with and they said you did such a phenomenal job in that appraisal negotiation.
[00:48:04] And I just want to say thank you because it's working with quality people is kind of rare in our
[00:48:08] industry today. I just want to say congratulations. Thank you for going in transaction with us.
[00:48:12] There's ever an opportunity to talk about what we can offer you. I love that opportunity.
[00:48:17] No, it's probably not in the car today, but if it ever is, I want you to know that door is wide open
[00:48:21] for you. Now what I'm going to start to do now is I'm just going to start to build a relationship.
[00:48:27] And most of us don't have any relationships with any of these three or four or five hundred people
[00:48:30] are trying to recruit. I got to find ways to build relationships. And we give people tons and tons
[00:48:35] of strategies on opening the door, getting in position and then getting ready to be at that when
[00:48:40] they say, yes, I want to come talk to you. I got 20 minutes. Tell me why I should come to your
[00:48:44] company. Then I have to have a beautiful recruiting presentation ready to go. It's a stack value,
[00:48:49] right? So I love that. And you know, celebrating what we call celebrating superlatives or in this
[00:48:55] case, Jim brought a great example of calling the co-op broker saying, hey, we do this too,
[00:49:03] where we send, well, I call after, but I send an email saying, hey, we just congratulations,
[00:49:09] you just closed the steal on such as this property. Thanks for working with our agent. We're
[00:49:13] so grateful that you guys got this closed and then assuming the agent told us they did a great
[00:49:18] job. We'll say, hey, agent said you were amazing. And, hey, congratulations again. I don't ask for,
[00:49:24] you know, hey, join our firm in that email because I don't want to take away from the authentic,
[00:49:28] hey, I'm really, really happy that you did this and I just want to congratulate you. Then when I call,
[00:49:33] I'll call say, hey, just also wanted to leave a message, super happy by the, you know, and then I'll
[00:49:38] go through that same thing and then I'll say, hey, by the way, just like you said, I'm sure you're
[00:49:42] perfectly happy where you are. And I like saying that because it doesn't, someone's either happy
[00:49:48] or they're not, right? Like there's nothing I'm going to say. So all I want to do is just kind of
[00:49:51] put the midis and say, hey, I'm sure you're happy where you're on, where you are, you're where
[00:49:55] you're at. It's a great firm. If that ever changes, please, please call me because you're exactly who
[00:50:00] we want. And I'm going to stay in touch with you so that you don't forget about me, but I will be
[00:50:04] patients and I am here for you if anything ever changes. You know, and, and then you're like you say,
[00:50:10] you just open the door and then just like you were saying with someone's sphere of influence, you
[00:50:14] know, you set up those touch points, same thing on the recruiting side. And this is also the same
[00:50:19] way too. Newer agents could learn from top agents is, you know, new agents, I think miss a huge
[00:50:26] opportunity. I know we're switching gears, getting away from recruiting just for a moment. But if
[00:50:30] you're a new agent listening to the show and we have a lot of them, you know, write a list of the
[00:50:34] producers, the REALTORS in your local market that you really admire and make a commitment to call,
[00:50:41] you know, whether they work at your company or whatever company, it doesn't matter. Reach out to
[00:50:44] them over, you know, over the next year, make a list of 50 of them and say, hey, I'd love,
[00:50:49] I really admire you. I love what you do. Maybe give them a specific reason why you admire them.
[00:50:54] Could I pick your brain for 15 minutes? Can I bring some coffee in to your office? I know you're
[00:50:58] busy, but I just wanted to shake your hand and just say hi and introduce myself because I really
[00:51:02] admire. Like that would be an extraordinarily smart thing to do for a new agent because then they
[00:51:08] could go and get an audience with that top producer for at least a few minutes and say, hey, I'd
[00:51:12] love a couple of quick tips if you have any or I'm struggling with this part of my business. What
[00:51:16] might you suggest? And they will just give you the answers. So it's the whole reason we built this
[00:51:20] whole show was built on my pie. It has to top producer who doesn't know me to like share their
[00:51:26] secrets with the world. Would they do that? I thought, I don't know. And turn off they will. I
[00:51:31] found out that they do. They have no problem doing that. I was sure that the number one recruiting
[00:51:36] opportunity we've had in the last 10 years is upon us right now. And that is the M.E.R. Southern.
[00:51:40] So you need to look at this is the number one recruiting opportunity and be all in on this right
[00:51:45] now. And the scripts that we're getting to our team are broker-to-chew students. You know,
[00:51:50] we give them a lot. But one of the things is if you're doing live classes in your offices,
[00:51:55] invitations to those live classes, if you create a brokerage, excuse me, a broker,
[00:52:01] a buyer, a broker presentation or a buyer presentation, that's a great one when you're talking
[00:52:06] about opinion. If I call you and say, hey, we just rolled out a new buyer presentation. I just
[00:52:11] ran the numbers. You're one of the top 20 buyer agents in the market. I love your honest feedback.
[00:52:16] I mean, you can be completely brutal with me, but I'd love to get your feedback on what you think we
[00:52:20] built here. Would you have coffee with me? And people will appreciate it because it's an ego
[00:52:24] stroke. Sure. And they'll love it. But also, I like the idea of my friends at the Ninja program
[00:52:30] have something they call the pit where they have agents get into the pit. So to speak,
[00:52:36] we're around a conference room. They're going to fire at each other objections and, you know,
[00:52:41] we're practicing scripts with each other role-playing. I think that's such a great idea when it comes
[00:52:45] to this whole buyer representation issue. And inviting other offices and other agents from other
[00:52:50] companies and say, hey, we're having a whole role-playing session this Wednesday on this whole buyer
[00:52:56] presentation stuff. We've got some scripts that we've rolled out that we feel good about. Do you
[00:53:00] got something you got? Come on. Let's all work together to get better at this. It'll be a lot of
[00:53:05] agents that respond to that. You know, I love that. I have not seen that. We're one of the largest
[00:53:10] real-ter markets in the country here in Chicago. We have about 46,000 agents. And I'm not on every
[00:53:15] mailing list from every brokerage, of course. And there's probably a lot that don't email to me.
[00:53:21] But I get a lot of emails. I have yet to see a come one come all. Let's all practice how to get
[00:53:27] better at buyer agency representation. I have yet to see I know brokerages are doing it certainly.
[00:53:32] And so that's a wonderful idea is to invite people from outside of your brokerage to participate,
[00:53:37] maybe bring in an expert somebody who you know who teaches this. Oh, and by the way, we should also
[00:53:42] make you talked about ABR designation. I believe and I hope I'm not wrong about this. I NAR had made
[00:53:47] that a complimentary thing. I don't know if it still is. Is it still complimentary? Everybody should
[00:53:52] go do this. Go to NAR.reelter and look for the ABR designation. It used to cost money. And now it's
[00:53:58] now it doesn't. So this is you're going to need this anyway, as of course, if you're working with
[00:54:02] buyers. So go get that designation. Boy Jim, this is you're really providing a tremendous
[00:54:08] amount of value. I am also curious to ask you back to agent production. What do you recommend?
[00:54:18] We talked about these touch points, like 20 to 50 touch points a year per person in your database.
[00:54:25] So let's say I sell somebody a home, they may move in. And now the stats say I'm probably seven to
[00:54:31] nine years before they are going to move. So now I have to keep that relationship going, assuming I
[00:54:37] want to be in the business in seven to nine years, because I want that repeat business. And how do I
[00:54:42] what would you recommend to make sure that those people don't forget that I was the one that sold
[00:54:47] in the home. And obviously the answer is yeah, you stay in touch. You call, you text, you email,
[00:54:51] and yes, all of all it. I'm not asking for a secret magic bullet that you know that no one else
[00:54:57] knows. But what do you typically suggest to agents so that people don't fall through the cracks
[00:55:02] once they once they've already transacted? Well, one of the things is a simple, simple thing that
[00:55:08] I'd say 95% of agents don't do is at the day you close that transaction, you're coming back to your
[00:55:14] CRM and you're flagging their home anniversary date. The interest rate they paid for the house,
[00:55:18] which is now today's going to be super important over the next two to three years. And their
[00:55:23] loan type, their loan, their loan if they have PMI insurance, everything you can record in that
[00:55:28] in your CRM about that. But now every year when their home anniversary rolls around, of course,
[00:55:33] people can send a card and an email and that kind of thing. But you're not doing that. You're
[00:55:37] you're leveling up and you're going to call them and say, hey guys, it's now time for your home
[00:55:41] annual home equity assessment. And I'm just going to give you a quick update. I want you to
[00:55:44] let's have what's happened to your home value. Good news. You look like your home has gone up
[00:55:48] $20,000 in value. Congratulations. And then a couple years from now, it's going to happen. And maybe
[00:55:53] a as low as a year from now. And by the way, guys, you guys financed at 7%
[00:55:58] interest rates are now down to 4.5% or 5% or whatever the number is going to be.
[00:56:02] I've got a great lender. If you're considering a refund, they could probably save you some dollars.
[00:56:06] So would you like me to refer you over? And I'm giving value value value. The spring summer of
[00:56:12] every market, I'm adding value by saying, hey guys, spring summers when most people do a lot of
[00:56:17] work on their houses, I've got a vendor relationships with most of the best talented contractors
[00:56:21] in the market area. They give you the best prices, the best service. If you got some money,
[00:56:26] if you get some work you want to do, reach out to me and I'll put you in touch. So you want to
[00:56:36] drive towards friendship. So I want to try to be more than that. I want to try to continue to have
[00:56:42] even a deeper relationship, not just a transactional relationship but a deeper relationship.
[00:56:47] But those are a couple of value at points that you can do really easily.
[00:56:50] I love that. And Jim, I could keep you here all day and I would love to keep you here all day,
[00:56:55] but you are a busy man with a brokerage to run, lots of agents to service and of course,
[00:57:01] coaching clients to service as well and podcasts to make and books to write.
[00:57:05] So I will let Jim get on with his busy day, but I would love to have Jim back because he
[00:57:12] really gave about 10 solid strategies in our conversation about how you could grow your business,
[00:57:19] attract other agents as well if you're looking to do that and just be top of mind. And really,
[00:57:24] it boils down to a lot as do your homework, right? Be prepared, that old Boy Scout motto, come,
[00:57:30] practice your presentations, bring data with you, have so much on stack the deck with so much
[00:57:37] value that it will be very difficult for somebody not to understand your value, right?
[00:57:42] If you have to learn how to effectively communicate it, but you also have it. So have that,
[00:57:46] like, as Jim was saying at the beginning, no one's going to work harder for you than me and here,
[00:57:50] I'm going to show you exactly what that means. Because of course, talk is cheap. It's like every
[00:57:54] brokerage says in the recruiting site, we have the best training and coaching. Well, everybody says
[00:57:58] that probably isn't, I want to know more specifics, right? So you have to prove your value to your
[00:58:04] clients or if you're recruiting agents. And, you know, there's a lot of great ways to do that.
[00:58:10] So we're talking about a lot of communication. I think it sounds like these are communication skills
[00:58:14] that anyone really can develop or sharpen those tools. And this is this is the year to do that.
[00:58:20] Because we're basically sharpened by sharpening communication, we increase our
[00:58:24] our relationships with people. We deepen those relationships and we of course get more effortless
[00:58:30] effortless referrals. You mentioned Bob Berg earlier. He is the king of referrals. I think he has
[00:58:35] a book called Endless Referral. There he has a lot of books, but Endless Referrals is a really good
[00:58:38] book. It's probably a million years old now, but it's probably been revised. If you read anything
[00:58:43] by Bob Berg, you're going to change your perspective. And also too, I love the fact that you mentioned,
[00:58:50] you know, don't worry too much about price when you're dealing with buyers. Just make sure you
[00:58:53] explain it correctly. And what, you know, there's always a solution to any challenges.
[00:58:59] So I want to really encourage all of our listeners to do a few things. First,
[00:59:03] I want you to subscribe to Jim's podcast, which is eReal Estate Coach. We'll have a link to that
[00:59:07] in the show notes. It's available everywhere podcasts are found. And let's check out Jim's
[00:59:12] coaching because this is the kind of thing Jim does with each of his coaching clients. So eReal

Okay, today on the show, we really have a true Renaissance man. Jim Remly, I want to tell you, Jim is a very humble person, but I'm going to brag for him because what he has accomplished is nothing really short of remarkable. Not only has he been a top producer, it's also a brokerage owner, he is a recruiter, he is a podcast host, an author, an educator for National Association of REALTORS. This man does it all and we are so honored to have him on the show, but let me actually tell you more about Jim. So Jim Remly began his real estate, this is also incredible. He began his real estate career at 19 and quickly became a top performer, which nobody does at 19 except Jim. He ranked in the top 1% of REALTORS nationwide, which is insane. Within a year, he listed over 150 properties, and by the age of 24, he founded the largest independent real estate company in Oregon. Of course, he did growing it to 17 offices with his extensive experience. Jim became an instructor for the National Association of REALTORS and co-founded the luxury home council. He authored the accredited loan, sorry, the accredited luxury home specialist designation, ALSH, and three best selling books, including sell your home in any market. Jim's expertise has led to appearances on various television and radio programs, including CNN's open house. He currently leads one of Oregon's largest real estate firms, closing 3,000 transactions annually with a sales volume of over 1.4 billion and aims to help agents and brokers accelerate their performance. Jim also hosts the podcast eReal Estate Coach, where you can find wherever podcasts are served. So there's so many things about Jim. If you go into our description, we're going to have a link to his podcast, his coaching, and also his books on Amazon. But if you want to check out his coaching offering, eReal Estate Coach.com. And before we bring him on, if you are a REALTOR in the Southern Oregon area, and you would like to work with Jim, I know I would, if I live there, I would want to check out to see what Jim's brokerage offers. You can reach out to Jim directly. He is with John L. Scott, and he has a, that's his brokerage in Southern Oregon, and we'll give you his contact information, Charlie. Jim, welcome to the show. Well, thank you so much. That's quite an induction. I appreciate that. You've done quite a lot. And I am, I'm actually a little intimidated. So I appreciate a fellow podcast host and author and a National Association of REALTORS is our backyard here. So we can, I can appreciate that I have, I actually would like to serve at the at the national level. So I'm in the process of going through the ranks to hopefully get to help out in some way. But I would love to really learn more about you. First of all, starting a real estate career at 19 is, well, everyone listening knows that's not an easy thing. And tell us sort of why you did that and then how you became so successful so quickly. Well, as a college dropout, first of all, and I don't recommend that I can, my kids are, are required to go to college. So that I didn't, I was a terrible college student, barely graduate high school for that matter. But I went to work at a lumber mill in, in Roosevelt, Oregon where I grew up. It's the lumber camp level world. So anybody that doesn't go to college goes and works at a lumber mill. So I was working graveyard lumber mill. And I'll never forget one of the first nights I was coming down with graveyard shift. I was trying to go to college at the same time, didn't work out. But I was coming down the, the, the walkway and now these big lumber ponds. And there's always floating lumber. And up towards me to start the day shift and they're wearing jackets and they're proud of the jackets. And they should be hardworking guys. But the, the jackets have, um, little arm bands that say how long they've been there. And one guy was 20 years, 30 years, 25 years, one guy had 40 years. And I thought to myself, do I want to be doing this for 30, 50 years or 40 years? And I thought I've been to do something else. I had to do something else quickly. And so I pivoted and got my real sale license. And that was kind of my, a little bit of my origin story. I've always been entrepreneurial. I started my first business when I was 15, win clear, window cleaning. I love it. Yeah. And so, you know, I was, I was a hard worker at a young age, but I needed to channel that into something that would give me a way that I could, you know, leverage my talents when you don't have any money, which is where I wasn't that point in my life. Well, I mean, what 19 year old has, has anything really? I mean, I know I didn't. But passing the test is one thing because, you know, you could just be a good student and pass the test or, or, you know, particularly good at, you know, educational testing. But to actually then become successful at 19 and then by 24, you know, opening a firm, you know, how did you find clients when you were that young? I would assume that would be a bit of an uphill battle to convince people, hey, you know, let me sell your home at 19. Yeah. Well, and I just just to back up, step for anybody listening to this, that is younger. I was not a great test digger. I failed the first time. So, your test score on the, on the national and state exams has nothing to do with your success level. Thank goodness. I mean, I sometimes I have people coming, they say, I got 100% and I was like, you studied too much. Yeah, it's a great question. So when I was 19, you know, when I'm going out to interview for jobs, most of the people that I'm interviewing with are, you know, 30, 40, 50 years old and they look at me like, whoa, you know, I've got kids older than you. Why would I trust my largest financial assets in you? Then you barely can grow facial air. So my, my, the way I was able to sell myself is to come in more prepared than any other REALTOR. So I would really go all in on prep. And so I learned something a long time ago that for every one minute at prep, says four minutes of execution. So you gotta prepare really, really as if you're, you're going to get there every listing like this is, you're not just going from an appointment, you're getting the listing. And if you're getting the listing, why not just do all the work? So that means you know, all the county research, all the city research, all the zoning research, all the CCNARS, you're just going all in. You're going to know more about that property than the seller when you get there, right? And that would impress people, right? Sure. And then I would say, I would just, you know, you got to go out the aged thing head on up your young, right? Because the, the unsaid is worse than the, than the said, right? There's an old marketing principle called if you can't fix it, feature it. And this is what we're talking about. Yeah. One hundred percent. You take the sting out, right? And you're just going to deal with it right up front. So I would say, obviously, I'm younger than most people that you're interviewing, right? But can I tell you why that's an advantage? And everybody like, yeah, I told them that's, it's an advantage because I'm going to outwork every other interview. I'm going to give you all my attention, all my effort, all my energy, and I am completely open to critique. So if you don't like anything I'm doing, you tell me, I'll be the first to change it. But I guarantee you, you will get no one that will work harder than I am. And that listens to that has a kid or a grand kid. And they're like, I'm going to give the kid a shot. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And I was, I didn't mean to stop either, but I was so impressed with that, because not only is that a nice thing to say, but you also had done the homework and it wasn't just like, hey, I'm going to outwork everyone. I'm going to show you right now how I've already, I mean, without saying that you've probably already outworked the other listing agents who might have come in to, you know, also bid on that, on that business. And so I love that it's backed up by action. And you're right is there is something about giving a young person a shot when they're eager, you know, they seem really authentic. And you sort of want to root for the underdog, right? We like rooting for underdogs. And I think young people have that, again, you're right, they address the issue head on, hey, here's why, you know, I don't have 40 clients that I'm dealing with right now. I have you. And I am going to, I need you to be happy because so I'm going to do whatever it takes. And you're going to tell me if there's anything I need to change. And I just, I love that. Well, that was just so perfectly said. One other spin on that too that I trained to now with agencies, you know, people can read confidence really quickly. And if you come in and you're not confident, it makes everyone uncomfortable really fast. It does. It's like, look at out of your spas as possible. So, and so the question mark is how do I build confidence for young people for every age, so it's just young people. And the way you build confidence is through competence. Correct. And the way competence is built is through rehearsal, practice syndrome, reperson, practice drill. And the great book outliers by Malcolm Gladwell, he talks about, you know, the 10,000 hour role that every master, whether it's a musician, artist, a writer, you know, some of the in sports, they bought across the 10,000 hour threshold. So if we relate that to real estate, and we say, well, how much of I really truly honestly practice my listing presentation? By practice to five hours, my practice of 10,000, certainly not 10,000 hours, but if I practice it, a hundred hours this year, probably not. So if you have this expectation, you're going to make a million dollars this year, and you're not putting the time in to be a master, you've got to disconnect there. You want to be the master, you got to, you got to act like a master, you got to go all in. Yeah, I agree. It's it's very akin to getting physically fit, which, you know, there's a visual component to getting physically fit. And but the work that it take, there's only really one way to do it through hard work. I guess you could get implants surgically inserted, which are the facade of muscles. But if you really want actual muscles, you have to be willing to put yourself, you have to be willing to give, you know, that 10,000 hours in the gym, the Beatles, which which are talked about in outliers, the book are really the perfect example of this, because before they ever recorded their first album, they had 10,000 hours of live studio or live performance because a time because they were playing in Germany for eight to 12 hours at a time. And so they just got that good. They knew, they knew like 500 songs by that. But it really was their sort of, you know, incubation period too. And obviously we know, we know what they accomplished. And so many others are in that same category of, you know, output. But you're right, it's all about practice. It's it's like, I guess if I, if I was wanting to go to a listing presentation and it was a luxury property, for example, I would probably need to put in a bunch of time on my own to perfect that presentation, run it by a bunch of people, record myself doing it, and then make lots of modifications over and over and over and over again until until it didn't sound like a presentation, I guess. But, but you're right, it's all it's all about the practice and the work. And the good news too is 10,000 hours is a pretty daunting number. It's almost like an un not conceivable number. But if you just chip away at it, you know, a little bit every day, you know, you put an hour in a day of studying the MLS and your chosen market or whatever skill you want to develop. Within a year, you probably are going to be on the right track. You're probably going to be like, wow, I just know a whole lot. I'm a big, big believer of this. You do so many, so many things, you're brokerage owner, you're a top producer, and of course, instructor and a coach now. Where do you see just because I want to jive into the coaching? So so much. And by the way, again, gyms, coaching website is erealestatecoach.com. You has all sorts of different programs and services for agents, specifically a lot around recruiting too, which I don't see that much of. So maybe you're a team and you're looking to recruit more agents or maybe you're a brokerage owner. We have a lot of brokerage owners that listen and you're like me, I'm a recruiter. That's what I do. So I'm interested in learning from gym two. But before we get to the recruiting stuff, let's talk about just keeping agents productive right now. You know, it's obviously not the easiest time to be a real tour. I would guess we have the NAR lawsuits. We've got buyer agency changing, although I don't, actually we could we could talk just briefly about buyer agency. But I'm curious to what your coaching agents to do today to stay productive, even though rates aren't exactly where we want them to be. Inventory is probably not exactly where we want it to be, but we still have to keep working. So how are you keeping your agents working and productive? Well, there's a magic number in the real estate industry that you know, you have to embrace it if you're going to be successful. And I learned this pretty early. And that is that your success as an agent is relative to what I call Q2. And Q2 is the quantity and quality of your database, your sphere of influence. And we hear it all the time. But NAR studies this. It's not like it's a you know, some mystical tank. This is truth. And so the latest study shows that 69% of sellers found their agent from referral. 61% of buyers found their agents are referral. So the first thing we have to do is agencies accept that and say, okay, number one, before I go chasing rabbits and chasing down all these internet things that people are selling me. The first thing I got to do is fix my sphere. And then I got to say, is my sphere completely dialed in? Number one. And then I need to understand the path is in the math. The numbers are what's going to drive your business, nothing else. So the numbers are very simple. So if I want to close X number transactions, I take that number times 10. It tells me the exact number of people I need my sphere of influence. I want to close 30 transactions. I need 300 people. Then everybody has a gap number. That's the number you have now. The difference between what you want, what you have now is your gap. And you got to fill that gap as fast as you can when you possible. And then beyond that, I've got to create a 20 to 50 touch point matrix on how I'm going to touch these people for the course of year of a state top of mind. Yeah. Now some of you that are older, like me, that I've been in business 35 years, that number used to be 9 to 12 times year. Now it's 20 to 50 times year because every American is hearing minimum of 5,000 advertising matches is a day. So we have to cut through the communication jungle to stay top of mind. And what's nice about what we're talking about is deepening the relationships, deepening the connections we have with our sphere because the numbers are on our side. When we do that, as Jim said, you know, nearly seven out of every 10 people choose a REALTOR either from someone they have already worked with in the past or a referral from somebody who said, you got to work with my buddy, you know, here she is the greatest. So this is where I think the really fun part about being a REALTOR comes in because you can control all of the touch points, like you can set up systems and we've had episodes on this where, you know, you don't, if you're having to talk to touch somebody 20 to 50 times a year, you're certainly not calling them 20 to 50 times going, hey, are you ready to sell your home? Obviously, we're not talking about that. We're talking about ways to provide value, ways to just stay front of mind or back of mind. And there's lots of fun ways to do that. You know, the traditional path would be email newsletters and, you know, client appreciation events and all sorts of, you know, sending out updated comps and celebrating somebody on their home anniversary and all of these things that were like, yeah, I should do that. But also too, now with social media, we have the ability to see what our clients are doing in their personal lives. And if we're connected with them on LinkedIn, we can see what they're doing in their professional lives. And we can actually take some notes and say like, oh, hey, I saw so and so, just got a promotion at work or I saw something for the company this person works. I just had a big news story. I'm going to, that's a touch point. I'm going to reach out to be like, hey, I just saw you got a promotion. You're crushing it. Keep, you know, it's, to me, it's all about building intimacy as, as best as possible, which is really a lot of effort because you have to go through and pay attention to what's going on in your clients and your spheres lives. And I'm curious to get some suggestions about how you might encourage people to get their sphere in order so that they can get more of that 69 percent. Yeah. Well, I think you're exactly right. I mean, I coach people that are in, you know, doing 50, 60, 70, 80 million dollars a year, 100 million dollars a year. And when you talk to them, and for any of the time, what happens is every single time with all these top producers, they will say, hey, I just, just to my friend's house, or I just saw my buddy house, they don't look at their clients as transactional units on a spreadsheet. And this is a difference. Week agents look at their clients as transactional units on a spreadsheet. Strong agents, the strongest agents in America look at their clients as relationships. And they look at this as friends and friends refer friends. This is a, this is an ultimate aspect of our sphere that most people messes your job is to move people up the ladder of friendship. So they start as an acquaintance to meet an open house. And you want to just try to bubble that relationship up to a point where they look at you as, hey, Jim's a friend of mine. And I refer friends to friends. That's the ultimate goal. So how do you get there? Right? So the way you're going to get there is through communication. And then communication is going to look like not always trying to sell them something there. It gets on the out of it. Right? So the, in the great book, GoGibber by Bob Burry. Great. We'll look about this kind of concept. I'm just going to give you a couple examples. Number one, is understanding at all of your clients is aspirational goals. So if I was talking to you, I'd say, hey, man, tell me what, what do you want to get done in the next six months to a year? What do you, your big goals? And you're going to tell me something, right? I want to open a bakery. I want to go to Hawaii, whatever it happens to be. And then I'm going to say, oh, okay, now I'm going to be on the watch for that. And if I can help you with that, oh, I found a great article on, on opening the big, I love that. I've been to Hawaii. I just had this happen, by the way, for my honeymoon, I got married six years ago. One of my agents heard that we're going to Maui. He bought me a book, Scott Lewis, if he's listening to this, a ninja, amazing agent, top racing agent. He buys me a book about Maui and marks in the book those favorite places that he went in Maui. Oh, that's great. These are the kinds of things that elevate relationships to friendships, right? And when you stop thinking about how many referrals can I pull out of this, you know, that's not the way that top agents operate. Top agents operate a whole different mindset. Now, you need to put some numbers behind it. Here's one thing I look at it as I say, what's my students is you want to go big and go small every day. Let me give you an example. Sure. Going big is I'm going to do something that touches a large group of people every single day. So that could be my email newsletter, right? It could be that I'm doing a social media post, right? Something big. It could be I'm doing a voice mail drop to every single person on my database. Something big. And then I'm going to go small. Going small means I'm going to have personal interactions with a, we put a number behind it, and it's very specific, 10 people a day. And I'm going to have a phone call, a text, a direct message where I'm going to be physically talking to somebody 10 times a day, right? And that might look differently, like your examples of using, you know, social media as your own CRM, looking for life change and having comments about that. All great. But let me tell you that the secret weapon I see with top, top, top agents, the secret weapon and it's the least expensive, most effective, and kind of undercover prospecting is networking. And networking just means I am breaking bread with people or having lunch, coffee, dinner, drinks with somebody three times a week, minimum. If I'm doing that three times a week with people in my spirit of influence, your business will explode. There is no way you won't explode. Now in the meetings, do I have to talk about real estate? No, I don't. Real estate will come up because you are in real estate, but you want to sit there and talk real estate all the time. You're just going to talk and you're going to create friendships and relationships with people. I'm telling you guys, that is the most effective way to lead generate is networking, networking, networking. So here's my goal and I'll just give you a quick model and I know I'm talking a lot of time, but my goal is to solve perfect. My quick model for success with the agents is the 4-1-1-1 strategy. You're going to spend one hour a day in lead gen, primarily focused on your sphere of influence. But I'm going to add one more pipeline to whether it's Fisbo's expires, absentee, or something else. 20% of my time there are 80% of my time on sphere. One hour a day on lead gen, my goal of that hours is to set one appointment with a seller, a buyer, or a sphere member. Spere member is just as valuable as a buyer of seller meeting. Because I'm setting one appointment, I'm going on one appointment today. And then the most important thing that every agent needs to do every day is add one new person to the sphere of each single day. So that's what we call our perfect model. Yeah, it's a great point because if you do add one person a day, let's just, I don't know how many business days there are in the year, 220, something, something like that. So you're adding 200 plus people to your day. If you could add 200 plus people to your database, which is essentially meeting one person every weekday, roughly, and getting their information, of course, and putting it in your CRM and then working, and then as Jim said, you know, developing a communication strategy, like, how am I going to touch this person 20 to 50 times over the next 12 months? And then you're just literally running running the process, right? It's, it's okay. Today, I'm going to check out their social media tomorrow. I'm going to invite them to lunch or, you know, whatever the process is, every quarter, I'm going to, you know, reach out to them by telephone every once a year. I'll do a sit down, whatever. There's lots of ways to do this. We're not, we obviously, there's no one size fits all, but this is, I think the biggest missing piece that REALTORS oftentimes fall out of that habit of adding people to their database because they get caught up with all the to-do's of the day. They have clients they need to service. And of course, you know, when we know when we're dealing with transactions, things just fly at us at any given time and they really require a lot of times, our immediate attention and it takes us out of building the business. I'm working now in the business as opposed to on the business. I wanted to ask you, Jim, too. It's been really interesting. So, of course, I know everybody is sick of hearing about buyer agency representation. I got it. We're not going to have a big conversation about that. Hopefully, everybody has received some training from their brokerage or from their association about how to proceed in a way that's, you know, sort of mindful and authentic and certainly, you know, compliant. So we're not going to talk too much about this, but I wanted to ask your opinion as a coach because on this show, I talked to top 1% producers and I've asked every one of them, has this impacted your business? Now, obviously, we haven't seen a lot of 0% co-ops at least here in Chicago yet, but we are going to start seeing those. It will happen. People will have to deal with it and buyer representation is changing. Okay. Well, it isn't really changing. It's just being a lot more specific now. I'd say I'd argue that it really isn't changed. It's just more transparent, which I think is a good thing. But certainly a more difficult thing to explain as in the past, maybe the reason why we're in this situation is it wasn't explained well before, but now we do have to explain it and we should. I have found that talking to all these top agents, not one of the people I've talked to was worried about it. And so, I'm curious to get your thoughts on it. For anyone out there who's nervous about saying, gosh, I'm going to have to tell my buyers they might have to pony up. That's a tricky thing. Just curious on your thoughts about that altogether. That's a great question. I actually taught the ABR class for 10 years for NAR. So I was pretty versed in that. I've been teaching just in the last six months a class called the buyer representation mastery course across the country for brokerageism and boards. So it's a great topic. I think when you're seeing with top agents is that a lot of top agents have already adopted a standard of I'm only working with loyal buyers that are either under contract or would have no problem signing a contract. Right. Now that we're going to have to all be under contract. I think the scary point for agents that are maybe not used to having the confidence level that some of these top agents have is the biggest fear point is that is the commission conversation. Like how do I explain the commission to a buyer in a way that doesn't creep them out? Right. So number one and I'm telling all my students this you got three things you need to have right now. And I don't wait to August like today. You need to have a number one of buyer presentations just like a cell presentation. You should already build that right. We've got a 12 step it's 12 points that we believe she's going to buy a presentation. But that buyer presentations should have proprietary value built in. In other words, you can't just be doing what every other role she's doing. You got to actually have some reasons why I'm going to use you as opposed to the other 10,000 agents in this market. So proprietary value unique sign propositions are so important. I can give you a few if you want to go to the slide. An example would be you know the misconception. Like if you're going tick tock and you start talking about buyer representation like I have you get all the trolls pile on to you and they'll say why would I pay an age of 10 grand or 20 grand open a door for me. I can do that myself. Why would I pay an age of that kind of money to search for homes. I can do that for myself. And you know what? We need to listen to what's being said there because that's the perception that buyers have of us. So what are we going to do about that? I'll get you an example. So in on my buyer presentation obviously when you on the flip side of that when NA are does studies of buyers and I say what's the most valuable thing a buyer's age can bring to you. Number one is helping them find the right home. It's been number one for 20 years. It's always been number one. As long as I've been teaching it's been number one. So we have an economy here. We got to solve this. So here's the way I'm going to solve this. I'm going to give it two strategies. When I'm sitting with you I'm going to say so obviously one of the services I'm going to provide to you is helping you find the right property to purchase. Now a lot of people will just plug you into an MLS system or you know you could plug yourself into Road to a Conver Zillow and you can just get a stream of properties coming to you. Every agent can do that. But here's what I'm going to do. Now I'm going to add proprietary value. I'm going to add some unit. I'm going to hand curate every listing that sent you. So what that means is that I'm going to get a copy of every listing sent to you. And I'm going to tell you my thoughts on every property that's sent when you should look at it or not. Now you might say Jim that sounds like a lot of work. I'm going to the 50% of the agents in America have closed two deals last year. Less than two deals. When you tell them you can't handle this. That's BS. You can handle this. It's not like the end of the world. If you want to start closing you get to 50 transactions. Let's talk about the work involved. But you're not closing enough transactions for most of you. Well and at that point you hire somebody to do the other things that are taking up your time. Right. Exactly. And then then I go into the no stone on turn conversation. The no stone on turn conversations. Listen, here's the reality. We're in a low supply market when we have been for last 10 years. And what that means is a lot of the best listings ever hit the market. They never hit them on us. So my job really is to go way deeper than I'm lost. You're going to get the I'm lost up for sure. And I'm going to give you my care pin hand curation on that. But I'm also going to be looking at coming soon listings by networking with the top 10% agents in the make than the market that do a 9% of the business. I'm going to look at for sell by apps. I'm going to look at expire listings. I'm going to dive into neighborhoods that you're interested in. And if you want to either reach out and canvas that neighborhood and I'll shake loose. But it's thinking about now that's that's a real I'm only spasking you because this is a super cool idea. I'm so sorry, Jim. I want to Jim is saying something that is gold right now because I just want to make sure we pause for a moment to really get this idea out there. It's very wrapped on almost 600 episodes here. And this is really the one of the first times this particular idea has has been brought up. So what Jim's talking about is you know, you have a buyer and you know that buyer wants to live in a particular subdivision neighborhood community wherever. And you could in theory print up little flyers or something something of value to deliver to the homes in that area saying, Hey, I know your homes not on the market. I have a buyer that desperately wants to move into this area. Well, you would probably say desperately, but you know, you would say I have a I work with people who want to move in this area. If you would or you know, or ever think I'm not doing a good job of this. But we get the idea you can go out and look for listings as a buyer's agent. 100% and that's it's pure gold to do that. I mean, we go to the stats around that and how successful that is. But it absolutely works 100% live buyer prospecting is the best prospecting on earth when you're doing cold or warm kind of prospecting. But let me do the third thing we can't go through all 12. But the third thing I'm going to talk about in the buyer presentation, which is proprietary value as well, is I want to put a bright line here and I want to say, but finding the home is the easy part. Because they perceive it's the easy part anyway. It's not really easy. They have Zillow. Yes, they think it is. They perceive it to be easy. So I'm going to say finding the home is the easy part. The hard part for me is your agent is when we find the home you want to buy because that's what my work really begins. Here's what I'm going to do for you. And this is what I get into what my presentation is called deep research. So I'm going to do deep research on every property. This means I'm going to go to the county, pull all the permits that have been pulled on that property. I'm going to look at the zoning. I'm going to look at the overlays for the property. I'm going to get the disclosures taken and go through that with the fine tooth comb. I'm going to tell you what to sell or pay for the property. The last time they refinanced the property, I'm going to even talk to the neighbors on either side of the property, ask them what they know about the neighborhood. If they like the neighborhood, what don't they like the neighborhood. And if they know anything about the house, at least you know. By the time I'm done, you're going to know more about that house than the seller knows about that. Now, but as I'm going and I can go on and on and on, I'm going to show you neighborhood trends and nails. But I'm going to create a situation where I'm a category of one. There is no one that is going to come to them and give them the level of value I'm delivering. And they're going to know it in about 10 minutes of being with me. So now I'm going to eventually get down to how I'm compensated. I'm going to get down to the compensation question, which is the big fear point. That doesn't have to be fearful, guys. It can be so so easy and so seamless. It's all in your confidence level, which is built by confidence, which is built by rehearsal drill practice. So what I'm going to say is, hey guys, now how am I paid? I'm paid fee and my fee is x, but it's a success fee. And this is the key language. It's a success. Love that. Yes. And the success fee just means that you will not pay me a nickel, a dime, a penny. Unless you find the perfect home for you, we negotiate the best price that you're comfortable with. We get your financing or we go through all the appraisals, the inspections, the home gets underrided. You get everything you want in that house. We get all the way to closing your hand of the keys. That's when I'm paid. I'm not paid a dime. You don't close. So don't think you're there's some kind of hourly clock ticking. I'm not like a taxi. And here's what's going to happen. My fee, I'm going to try to get as much of my fee from the sellers possible. So what we write it on for, I'm going to ask the seller to pay all or most of that fee on your app. Now some sellers will agree, some sellers won't agree. And that's a negotiation. But this is going to be completely transparent. You're going to know exactly what you're getting into it. Every transaction you have the power to say no, I can't afford to do it, or I don't want to do it in every transaction. And here's what I'm going to recommend to all the agents that are listening. For most strong agents, when you have a listing a seller and you have an offer coming in, a lot of us do a net sheet. And we say, hey, here's what you're going to net. We have our little estimate calculator. Maybe we pulled from the title company app or the title company's doing it for us. And we say, what based on this offer you get X, we're going to start doing the same thing with buyers guys. We're going to say based on the offer that we've negotiated, here's what it would cost you a closing, which includes your down payment. It's great. Closing costs, my fees, everything else, so I can go on and on and on about this conversation, but that's kind of the way we work. I do also am curious to get your thoughts. If somebody says, well, I understand now that buyers are now paying and whatever they may read a story online, and they're not probably going to understand the full history of it. But I think it's really important to, I would love to get your thoughts, because you may have a different opinion. But if somebody says, well, hey, okay, it seems like I'm paying a new fee last time I didn't have to pay a fee. And last time I bought a home, I didn't cut a check to anyone. Well, actually, and that's where you could bring some data in and say, let me tell you about how the system was set up, how it worked, and you actually did pay fees. They weren't really easily disclosed or transparent. You weren't technically cutting a check. However, if we just sort of think about economics and traditional supply and demand, like it's built in to the price or, you know, anyway, and again, I'm not a practicing REALTOR, so forgive me for not saying that in the right appropriate way. But we understand that this is, we're now just bringing something a little bit more to the forefront. Yes, there's technically a step where they may have to write a check these days. They didn't have to do that before, but they were paying that one way or the other. And now they're just paying it more on the front end, versus having wrapping it into the mortgage or however it was, it wasn't really wrapped into the mortgage. It was part of the price. But it can make the strong argument that the fees have been paid this whole time, and it was just not super clear who was paying or how the fees were being paid. Yeah, I agree. And the way we, you know, the way I explained it on the seller side of the fence, which is as important to this whole conversation too, is to say, let me ask you, when you bought the house that you own now, did you write a check to your buyer's agent or to the seller paper that on your half? And they'll always be like, well, the seller runs the check. Okay, and can I tell you why that happened? And they'll say, oh, well, yeah, I'll tell you why it happened because what happens is you paid the seller's price and that price paid for the seller's representation and your representation. But what it allowed you to do is something very special. It allowed you to finance the representation costs in the transaction over 30 years, which is what most buyers prefer to do. Sure. Of course. What I recommend that we still offer by-raging compensation. And we can't do it in MLS, but we can certainly do it when people call us. And I recommend it because you're going to open up the buyer pool. The study's right now or that 30 to 50 percent of the buyers in the market can't afford to write through each and such. Right. So if we don't give them a way to finance this transaction cost, what's going to happen is you're in a 30 to 50 percent of your buyer pool, which most of us don't want to lose. It's going to cost you money. And we don't want to do that. And most people can explain that by their account. Okay. I'll give it. I'm also curious too, as another option, if there's going to be a way that lenders can kind of come to the rescue here and create a commission loan or a source where it can be financed. Maybe it's its own loan with its own rate. I mean, I don't know why banks wouldn't want to do that. I don't know about the compliance associated there. I know it hasn't. I don't think it's been done yet by any lender, but I would hope that there is going to be something to help out those those home buyers who are now. Oh gosh, now I need to come up with another 10 grand, right. And again, we're not seeing a lot of that today. But of course, there are going to be sellers who are going to start testing the waters to see if they don't have to pay out of pocket for the buyer fees. So I'll be curious. Do you do you obviously nobody has a crystal ball, but do you have a think that lenders could possibly come up with a solution to this or do or we're not sure yet? 100% I think my guess would be that Fannie and Freddie will roll out of a way that they can that buyers can finance the buyer closing costs. And this is this is just a part of your closing costs. I mean, the way to look at it. So I absolutely think that will happen. I wish it would have happened before any of our made the settlement. So it's easier. But I would my personal guess is that yes, that will happen. Well, I want to switch gears. Thank you for that that opinion. I want to switch gears because one of the things we don't ever talk about rarely talk about on the show is recruiting agents and as teams have become more and more significant over the last well ever since I've been in this industry 14 years, I've slowly seen the rise of teams for a lot of different reasons. And you know, also brokerages are always looking to attract agents teams are always looking to attract agents or maybe somebody's listening wants to develop a team. I know that this is a big passion of yours is some best practices around attraction versus like chasing, right? So how does one think about attracting a producing agent to their team or to partner up with or to join their brokerage because we know that agents get recruiting calls all day long every you know, every week from every firm that that's out there every firm is always recruiting pretty much. So they're getting a lot of these calls. And how do you sort of cut through the noise to actually get to to a good size producers, you know, sort of get on their radar so that you can actually cut through the other five calls they got that week about recruiting? Well, here's what let me tell you what what offices and team leaders should not do first and they should not focus on commission. And this is the number one trap and the number one mistake that brokerage owners and team leaders make is they think, well, if I just offer the lowest commission then lowest caps, you know, I'm going to track all the agents in my market and it's just absolutely not true. And the reason it's not true is because as soon as you go to five dollars, some of the markets are going to come before dollars and then you're going to raise to the bottom. And what has to happen in order for you to have that low cost structure is you end up having to cut services. So you're going to cut services and basically you're just giving people an umbrella to work under and you know, you're offering zero value. In fact, what I'm saying with some of the most successful offices and brokerage leaders and team leaders in the country dying is going to complete reverse of that. And they are saying, what's build out again, when I say this word for proprietary, but it's important is for proprietary value that makes me unique in the marketplace that is actually my value proposition. So if you're a broker, Joe, or a team leader listening, if you were to take out a piece of paper and write down what are the five reasons why someone should come to work for me? Five things I do differently or better than anyone else in the market. What would those be? And when you actually ask people that, most people don't have an answer to that. And so it can't just be a cult of personality. It can't be just thinking, I'm so great that everybody's going to come to work for me. Yes, people have to like you 100%. But beyond liking you, there has to be actual value behind coming to work for you. The only reason when people call me and say, Jim West, I can work for you, my answer that is always the same. There's only two reasons you should come to work for me. A, I can help you make more money or be I can make your life easier. I know that I can do both, but I need 20 minutes your time to show you. Now, so what it's about is it's about the number of transactions closed. So I've got a proof to you that I can help you close more transactions now or with me then you're closing down. That's it. So that is our whole focus of our presentation when we're talking to people is let me show you how I think we can help you close more transactions and make your life easier because work life balance for agents is super important, especially at a high level. Time control is super important and people have this desire that I don't want to kill myself working. I want to enjoy the money I'm making. So all of that plays as a factor in your recruiting presentation, your recruiting approach. Yeah, I agree. It's, you know, we're we're a perfect example of what you were talking about because when we started, when my boss started the our brokerage, we were a one person company at that time and I came on board a few years after it started and we had to recruit agents and when you're a two person, three person brokerage, you're just don't have a lot or we didn't have a lot to offer. Maybe there are smaller brokerages that have a lot to offer. We did not. And so we went the cost way, we are the cost savings way. We went highest commissions, lowest fees because that was we thought our only trump card and it worked to build us hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of agents. However, we weren't really attracting top producers. We were attracting great agents, whether they're part time or full time, but we weren't attracting the really massive producers. And the reason is because what we learned 10 years in, oh, they don't, top producers don't care about giving away 10, 15, 20% of their income if they're getting some other needs met by their brokerage, making their life easier as Jim said or increasing production. So they're happy to give away 10, 20, maybe even 30% of their commission if these other these other things are being solved. So I like that. And I'm curious to, so you know, if you want, if I want to recruit somebody to my team, I have to figure out first what my value prop, what is my true value proposition? Why not just, you know, if I say I can help you grow your production, I better be able to explain in detail how that is actually going to manifest as well as saving somebody time or solving some pain point. I better have an answer for that. And I think that's where practice comes in as you were saying, but also just really getting clear on why somebody needs to join you and then find, just find out what their pain point is and give them a solution. Yeah. And the way you have to look at it is I look at it as we're NFL coaches, we're NBA owners of our organization. And when you're doing a high level recruiting, high level recruiting is different than recruiting new agents. And so this is a whole, there's like a bright line in the sand. New agents are excited to come to work. They'll come to work for anybody anytime you can recruit them in an hour, right? They're just so excited. And I'm, I mean, facetious, but you know, it's easy to recruit new agents. Correct. It's much, much, much more difficult to recruit experience agents. But here's the problem with recruiting new agents is that there's an 87% nutrition rate. Right. So over the first two years, you have lose 87% of them. No matter how good your training is, no matter how good your mentorship and they take the most amount of effort and time and energy and from you as a broker, John, I'll lead her. I've got to completely let go of that. And I guys say, new agent recruiting is not wrong at I'm going after experience agents. And that's going to totally transform my company. If I just really go after that, the question is now, how do I do it? We have a seven step plan for doing it. That's very specific. But here's the thing. When you nine times out of a hundred, when you say, Hey, I'd love to do a recruiting presentation with you. I'm happy. I'm good. Where I am. Thanks. Exactly. It's not going anywhere. They're like, okay, no, thanks. Right. So here's the thing is that everybody's happy till they're not. So this is a really important thing to think about. So, but we've all seen people in our markets the last year that have moved. And you're like, damn, they moved. They didn't even come talk to me. They didn't even pick up the phone to have a conversation with me. Here's why they didn't do that because you didn't open the door. And so it's not about you going in for the throat like you would do with a new agent. It's about you building a relationship with them so that they know the doors open if and when they decide to raise their hand and say, I'm not happy because what happens is they're completely happy on Friday on Monday. They're pissed because the broker's career mover, the technology failed. They have a bad interaction with a staff member, somebody else in the office career mover. There's something went wrong. And now they go to the people that have opened the doors and then it's said, we want you. So what I have to do is I have to identify a target audience on my market, call 3, 4, 500 agents that you love to have. Then I need to open doors with all of them. And that's as simple as letting them know why they're why you're attracted to them as an agent. So it might be to say, John, Jim, Bob, Susan, I just want to say I was talking to one of our agents this morning. I know you're in transaction with and they said you did such a phenomenal job in that appraisal negotiation. And I just want to say thank you because it's working with quality people is kind of rare in our industry today. I just want to say congratulations. Thank you for going in transaction with us. There's ever an opportunity to talk about what we can offer you. I love that opportunity. No, it's probably not in the car today, but if it ever is, I want you to know that door is wide open for you. Now what I'm going to start to do now is I'm just going to start to build a relationship. And most of us don't have any relationships with any of these three or four or five hundred people are trying to recruit. I got to find ways to build relationships. And we give people tons and tons of strategies on opening the door, getting in position and then getting ready to be at that when they say, yes, I want to come talk to you. I got 20 minutes. Tell me why I should come to your company. Then I have to have a beautiful recruiting presentation ready to go. It's a stack value, right? So I love that. And you know, celebrating what we call celebrating superlatives or in this case, Jim brought a great example of calling the co-op broker saying, hey, we do this too, where we send, well, I call after, but I send an email saying, hey, we just congratulations, you just closed the steal on such as this property. Thanks for working with our agent. We're so grateful that you guys got this closed and then assuming the agent told us they did a great job. We'll say, hey, agent said you were amazing. And, hey, congratulations again. I don't ask for, you know, hey, join our firm in that email because I don't want to take away from the authentic, hey, I'm really, really happy that you did this and I just want to congratulate you. Then when I call, I'll call say, hey, just also wanted to leave a message, super happy by the, you know, and then I'll go through that same thing and then I'll say, hey, by the way, just like you said, I'm sure you're perfectly happy where you are. And I like saying that because it doesn't, someone's either happy or they're not, right? Like there's nothing I'm going to say. So all I want to do is just kind of put the midis and say, hey, I'm sure you're happy where you're on, where you are, you're where you're at. It's a great firm. If that ever changes, please, please call me because you're exactly who we want. And I'm going to stay in touch with you so that you don't forget about me, but I will be patients and I am here for you if anything ever changes. You know, and, and then you're like you say, you just open the door and then just like you were saying with someone's sphere of influence, you know, you set up those touch points, same thing on the recruiting side. And this is also the same way too. Newer agents could learn from top agents is, you know, new agents, I think miss a huge opportunity. I know we're switching gears, getting away from recruiting just for a moment. But if you're a new agent listening to the show and we have a lot of them, you know, write a list of the producers, the REALTORS in your local market that you really admire and make a commitment to call, you know, whether they work at your company or whatever company, it doesn't matter. Reach out to them over, you know, over the next year, make a list of 50 of them and say, hey, I'd love, I really admire you. I love what you do. Maybe give them a specific reason why you admire them. Could I pick your brain for 15 minutes? Can I bring some coffee in to your office? I know you're busy, but I just wanted to shake your hand and just say hi and introduce myself because I really admire. Like that would be an extraordinarily smart thing to do for a new agent because then they could go and get an audience with that top producer for at least a few minutes and say, hey, I'd love a couple of quick tips if you have any or I'm struggling with this part of my business. What might you suggest? And they will just give you the answers. So it's the whole reason we built this whole show was built on my pie. It has to top producer who doesn't know me to like share their secrets with the world. Would they do that? I thought, I don't know. And turn off they will. I found out that they do. They have no problem doing that. I was sure that the number one recruiting opportunity we've had in the last 10 years is upon us right now. And that is the M.E.R. Southern. So you need to look at this is the number one recruiting opportunity and be all in on this right now. And the scripts that we're getting to our team are broker-to-chew students. You know, we give them a lot. But one of the things is if you're doing live classes in your offices, invitations to those live classes, if you create a brokerage, excuse me, a broker, a buyer, a broker presentation or a buyer presentation, that's a great one when you're talking about opinion. If I call you and say, hey, we just rolled out a new buyer presentation. I just ran the numbers. You're one of the top 20 buyer agents in the market. I love your honest feedback. I mean, you can be completely brutal with me, but I'd love to get your feedback on what you think we built here. Would you have coffee with me? And people will appreciate it because it's an ego stroke. Sure. And they'll love it. But also, I like the idea of my friends at the Ninja program have something they call the pit where they have agents get into the pit. So to speak, we're around a conference room. They're going to fire at each other objections and, you know, we're practicing scripts with each other role-playing. I think that's such a great idea when it comes to this whole buyer representation issue. And inviting other offices and other agents from other companies and say, hey, we're having a whole role-playing session this Wednesday on this whole buyer presentation stuff. We've got some scripts that we've rolled out that we feel good about. Do you got something you got? Come on. Let's all work together to get better at this. It'll be a lot of agents that respond to that. You know, I love that. I have not seen that. We're one of the largest real-ter markets in the country here in Chicago. We have about 46,000 agents. And I'm not on every mailing list from every brokerage, of course. And there's probably a lot that don't email to me. But I get a lot of emails. I have yet to see a come one come all. Let's all practice how to get better at buyer agency representation. I have yet to see I know brokerages are doing it certainly. And so that's a wonderful idea is to invite people from outside of your brokerage to participate, maybe bring in an expert somebody who you know who teaches this. Oh, and by the way, we should also make you talked about ABR designation. I believe and I hope I'm not wrong about this. I NAR had made that a complimentary thing. I don't know if it still is. Is it still complimentary? Everybody should go do this. Go to NAR.reelter and look for the ABR designation. It used to cost money. And now it's now it doesn't. So this is you're going to need this anyway, as of course, if you're working with buyers. So go get that designation. Boy Jim, this is you're really providing a tremendous amount of value. I am also curious to ask you back to agent production. What do you recommend? We talked about these touch points, like 20 to 50 touch points a year per person in your database. So let's say I sell somebody a home, they may move in. And now the stats say I'm probably seven to nine years before they are going to move. So now I have to keep that relationship going, assuming I want to be in the business in seven to nine years, because I want that repeat business. And how do I what would you recommend to make sure that those people don't forget that I was the one that sold in the home. And obviously the answer is yeah, you stay in touch. You call, you text, you email, and yes, all of all it. I'm not asking for a secret magic bullet that you know that no one else knows. But what do you typically suggest to agents so that people don't fall through the cracks once they once they've already transacted? Well, one of the things is a simple, simple thing that I'd say 95% of agents don't do is at the day you close that transaction, you're coming back to your CRM and you're flagging their home anniversary date. The interest rate they paid for the house, which is now today's going to be super important over the next two to three years. And their loan type, their loan, their loan if they have PMI insurance, everything you can record in that in your CRM about that. But now every year when their home anniversary rolls around, of course, people can send a card and an email and that kind of thing. But you're not doing that. You're you're leveling up and you're going to call them and say, hey guys, it's now time for your home annual home equity assessment. And I'm just going to give you a quick update. I want you to let's have what's happened to your home value. Good news. You look like your home has gone up $20,000 in value. Congratulations. And then a couple years from now, it's going to happen. And maybe a as low as a year from now. And by the way, guys, you guys financed at 7% interest rates are now down to 4.5% or 5% or whatever the number is going to be. I've got a great lender. If you're considering a refund, they could probably save you some dollars. So would you like me to refer you over? And I'm giving value value value. The spring summer of every market, I'm adding value by saying, hey guys, spring summers when most people do a lot of work on their houses, I've got a vendor relationships with most of the best talented contractors in the market area. They give you the best prices, the best service. If you got some money, if you get some work you want to do, reach out to me and I'll put you in touch. So you want to drive towards friendship. So I want to try to be more than that. I want to try to continue to have even a deeper relationship, not just a transactional relationship but a deeper relationship. But those are a couple of value at points that you can do really easily. I love that. And Jim, I could keep you here all day and I would love to keep you here all day, but you are a busy man with a brokerage to run, lots of agents to service and of course, coaching clients to service as well and podcasts to make and books to write. So I will let Jim get on with his busy day, but I would love to have Jim back because he really gave about 10 solid strategies in our conversation about how you could grow your business, attract other agents as well if you're looking to do that and just be top of mind. And really, it boils down to a lot as do your homework, right? Be prepared, that old Boy Scout motto, come, practice your presentations, bring data with you, have so much on stack the deck with so much value that it will be very difficult for somebody not to understand your value, right? If you have to learn how to effectively communicate it, but you also have it. So have that, like, as Jim was saying at the beginning, no one's going to work harder for you than me and here, I'm going to show you exactly what that means. Because of course, talk is cheap. It's like every brokerage says in the recruiting site, we have the best training and coaching. Well, everybody says that probably isn't, I want to know more specifics, right? So you have to prove your value to your clients or if you're recruiting agents. And, you know, there's a lot of great ways to do that. So we're talking about a lot of communication. I think it sounds like these are communication skills that anyone really can develop or sharpen those tools. And this is this is the year to do that. Because we're basically sharpened by sharpening communication, we increase our our relationships with people. We deepen those relationships and we of course get more effortless effortless referrals. You mentioned Bob Berg earlier. He is the king of referrals. I think he has a book called Endless Referral. There he has a lot of books, but Endless Referrals is a really good book. It's probably a million years old now, but it's probably been revised. If you read anything by Bob Berg, you're going to change your perspective. And also too, I love the fact that you mentioned, you know, don't worry too much about price when you're dealing with buyers. Just make sure you explain it correctly. And what, you know, there's always a solution to any challenges. So I want to really encourage all of our listeners to do a few things. First, I want you to subscribe to Jim's podcast, which is eReal Estate Coach. We'll have a link to that in the show notes. It's available everywhere podcasts are found.
