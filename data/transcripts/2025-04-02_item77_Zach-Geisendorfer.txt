[00:01:15] Today's episode is brought to you by corded.io.
[00:01:18] Are you looking for agents to join your brokerage or team?
[00:01:22] Now, as a real estate recruiter,
[00:01:24] I can tell you the answer is always yes.
[00:01:27] But most agents aren't looking to move right now.
[00:01:29] So how do you know who to contact?
[00:01:32] Well, what if I were to tell you there's a recruiting
[00:01:33] and retention tool powered by artificial intelligence
[00:01:37] that shows you exactly which agents in your local market
[00:01:40] are looking to leave their brokerage right now
[00:01:42] and which agents at your own firm
[00:01:45] are also looking to leave you.
[00:01:47] Now, I've been recruiting REALTORS for 15 years
[00:01:50] and I've hired over 2000 agents.
[00:01:52] I can tell you with no exaggeration,
[00:01:55] this is the tool I've been waiting for.
[00:01:57] Corded's AI looks for trends across dozens of variables
[00:02:00] for each agent in your market
[00:02:01] and shows you which agents they believe are likely to move.
[00:02:05] Not only does it do that,
[00:02:06] but corded's AI went and visited my recruiting website
[00:02:09] and read everything I offer.
[00:02:11] So now when I'm recruiting,
[00:02:13] corded's AI tells me exactly what to say
[00:02:16] based on that agent's needs and what my brokerage can offer.
[00:02:19] It even writes emails for me.
[00:02:21] I've never seen anything like it
[00:02:23] and I use it every single day.
[00:02:26] Now, if you are looking to grow your brokerage,
[00:02:28] corded.io is the best tool out there.

[00:04:13] All right, guys, let's get on to my conversation with Zach Geisendorfer.
[00:04:29] What is the best piece of advice that you've ever received as an agent?
[00:04:35] I think the best piece of advice I've gone is also the simplest piece of advice,
[00:04:41] which I seem to find very often, you know, tends to be.
[00:04:44] So personally, my favorite one is the work works super simple.
[00:04:49] I got told super early in the sales, not even just real estate.
[00:04:52] Hey, like the work works in sales as long as you work the work.
[00:04:57] And I was like, oh my God, what are you even talking about the work?
[00:04:59] What is work in the work?
[00:05:00] And yeah, I'm just here to close deals.
[00:05:02] And as you kind of get going in any sales career whether it's real estate or something else,
[00:05:06] you realize, oh, the work.
[00:05:08] Yeah, it works.
[00:05:09] Okay.
[00:05:09] Trust, trust the process.
[00:05:11] Trust the process and also trust the basics.
[00:05:13] The basics are the basics for a reason.
[00:05:15] Like the normal work every day work that an agent does, it works most likely.
[00:05:21] You're just trying to bump out of that work.
[00:05:23] You know, trying to do something that's outside the wheel.
[00:05:26] One of my favorite expressions is before enlightenment, chop wood, carry water, after enlightenment,
[00:05:32] chop wood, carry water.
[00:05:34] It's like, you just got to do keep doing the basic.
[00:05:38] Okay.
[00:05:38] And what is a not great piece of advice?
[00:05:41] What's maybe the worst piece of advice you've ever heard as an agent?
[00:05:44] One of the first pieces of advice I got when I first came into real estate and we started
[00:05:48] growing our team was work with every single person.
[00:05:52] They were just like, cry to help every single person that's out there, get the masses,
[00:05:56] doesn't matter.
[00:05:57] Like, what's an avatar client?
[00:05:59] You know, all this stuff and it was just go, go, go, go, go.
[00:06:02] And it just didn't really work out too well for us personally.
[00:06:06] You know, it just, it was all these non-affered our clients, people that were hard, people
[00:06:10] that were out of our area.
[00:06:11] And we'd be like, talking with our coach and he was like, oh, it's only an hour and a half
[00:06:14] drive.
[00:06:15] That's totally fine.
[00:06:16] It's like three hours if your day is gone.
[00:06:18] And so I just learned very quickly.
[00:06:20] It wasn't a sustainable, replicable way to do it, which is why I think it's one of the
[00:06:25] worst pieces of advice I got because you're losing your number one asset, which is your
[00:06:30] time, you know, doing something like that.
[00:06:33] Perfectly said.
[00:06:34] Well, today our guest is Zach Geisendorf for with eXp in in in California and so Cal.
[00:06:42] Zach is a so Cal guy.
[00:06:44] He's actually been there his whole life grew up in Orange County and works predominantly
[00:06:49] in the San Diego area as well as Orange County.
[00:06:51] So let me tell you more about Zach.
[00:06:53] So Zach grew up in so Cal, like we mentioned, he's lived there his entire life, which again,
[00:06:57] super jealous of that.
[00:06:59] He's been in sales since high school where he got his start working the floor at Sports
[00:07:03] Shilé and he's been hooked on helping people ever since.
[00:07:07] And today he still lives in So Cal with the love of his life Rachel and a 28 years old.
[00:07:12] This is insane.
[00:07:14] He is the sales manager and partner at Fam Realty Group.
[00:07:18] He's a top performing mega team with eXp Realty having closed over 100 homes last year
[00:07:24] again in the in the 30 sorry the worst year for home sales in the past 30 years.
[00:07:31] He closed 100 homes and get this this year.
[00:07:34] He's on pace to do 222 homes.
[00:07:38] Incredible.
[00:07:39] His mission is simple to be the number one vehicle in the I love it is missions and simple,
[00:07:43] but but but very ambitious, which is the to be the number one vehicle in the United States
[00:07:49] for real estate agents to hit their financial goals.
[00:07:52] He's obsessed with building systems culture and sales skills that create real sustainable
[00:07:57] success for agents at every level and he is building his team.
[00:08:01] So our listeners, if you like what Zach is going to say and you probably will based on
[00:08:07] the amount of production that he and his team are doing, he's a good guy.
[00:08:09] I like him a lot and you should really consider talking to him and seeing if you'd be a fit.
[00:08:14] You know, Zach actually works with agents all over the country.
[00:08:17] So it doesn't just have to be local.
[00:08:19] So Cal folks, although if you are local, you should reach out to him as well.
[00:08:23] Follow him on Instagram.
[00:08:24] He is at Zach Zen, which Z.E.N.
[00:08:27] So ZAC, Z.E.N real estate will have a link to that in the show notes against Zach Zen,
[00:08:32] on Instagram, Zach.
[00:08:33] Welcome to the show.
[00:08:34] I appreciate it so much.
[00:08:36] I really appreciate you guys having me.
[00:08:38] Yeah, super excited.
[00:08:39] You are really a lot of fun to we would chat in a little bit before and and we seem to
[00:08:44] have a lot a lot of fun things to talk about.
[00:08:46] So first of all, I want to know how you got started in real estate.
[00:08:52] So what brought you to real estate?
[00:08:54] What were you doing before?
[00:08:55] I know you're mentioning you were at Sportschela, but how did you get from there to real estate?
[00:09:00] Definitely.
[00:09:01] So I realized very quickly that's your Sportschela that sales is where I was meant to be.
[00:09:05] I picked a pair of goggles weirdly enough.
[00:09:07] I ran the water section and I'd pick one pair of goggles, make that my product until
[00:09:12] they were sold out and I'd move to the next pair and the next pair and the next pair.
[00:09:15] And we like blue numbers off the roof and I was like, what am I doing at Sportschela?
[00:09:18] I was like, this is crazy.
[00:09:20] So I went through a bunch of different sales jobs, kind of, you know, work in my way up
[00:09:23] and I landed selling real estate leads for a company called Set Schedule.
[00:09:29] I'm sorry.
[00:09:30] I know those guys very well.
[00:09:31] They're right.
[00:09:32] They're so calm as well.
[00:09:33] They are so calm as well and not to put them down any way.
[00:09:36] Just over my year of being there, my first 30 days I broke a company record.
[00:09:42] So I knew phone sales communication is where I was supposed to be.
[00:09:46] After 90 days, I was in the top two sales reps consecutively for three months.
[00:09:52] And after a year of being there, I sold about a million dollars worth of leads.
[00:09:56] You know, that's where I met my business partner now, Francis,
[00:10:00] who I actually followed up with her for about five months trying to sell her leads.
[00:10:04] You know, in this company that we were a part of or that I was a part of.
[00:10:07] And she stopped me one day and just said, hey, what are you doing?
[00:10:11] Like selling leads.
[00:10:13] She was like, I'm not going to I'm not going to buy these from you,
[00:10:17] which is kind of stung.
[00:10:18] But she was like, if you ever need a job, like let me know.
[00:10:21] And it was kind of one of those like, sure, call me, you know, type of offers.
[00:10:24] I ended up quitting my job on the spot.
[00:10:27] It just kind of felt right.
[00:10:28] I have no idea why, but I quit it on the spot called her and said, hey, like,
[00:10:32] you need to hire me now.
[00:10:34] And so that's where I started in real estate as an ISA for anybody who doesn't know
[00:10:39] what an ISA is, essentially a cold collar.
[00:10:42] That's a rough, a rough starting job for you.
[00:10:45] But you know what, it's trial by fire.
[00:10:47] So ISA is somebody that is going to be taking inbound calls for leads,
[00:10:51] going to be making lots of outbound calls for leads.
[00:10:54] Basically, is sitting on the phone all day, trying to get people to answer
[00:10:57] or answer questions, setting up appointments.
[00:11:00] It is boy, not for the faint of heart for sure, but a really good way
[00:11:04] to learn how to talk about real estate because you're doing that all day long.
[00:11:06] Yep, 100% and I came in from knowing nothing about real estate to calling a homeowner
[00:11:12] and saying, hey, do you want to sell your house?
[00:11:14] You know what that's.
[00:11:15] And I learned very quickly what didn't work and took me a little bit longer
[00:11:19] to find what does work on that one.
[00:11:21] So my first year with her, I did about 100,000 outbound calls as an ISA.
[00:11:26] That was my goal was to hit 100,000 because in my mind, if I could do 100,000 calls,
[00:11:31] I would be an expert at cold calling homeowners.
[00:11:34] I learned quickly, it changes every year.
[00:11:37] So you sure you can be an expert, but every single year, you need to update your craft,
[00:11:41] you need to grow, you need to continue.
[00:11:43] So I kept on doing 100,000 calls every single year for the last five years,
[00:11:49] which ending I try to keep track of my wife or I should be pushing almost 600,000 calls over the last five years.
[00:11:59] Unbelievable.
[00:12:00] That is, you know, I have so much, you know, we talk about chop wood, carry water.
[00:12:03] That is chopping the wood and carrying the water.
[00:12:06] And certainly not the easiest thing to do.
[00:12:09] I want to give a quick shout out because Zach mentioned something, the art of calls and whether it's a cold call or follow-up calls.
[00:12:17] We all have, well, most of us have, suffer's act, has a little bit of call reluctance, right?
[00:12:21] So this is something that we just kind of, we don't really want to call.
[00:12:24] People aren't calling as much these days.
[00:12:26] And the follow-ups are in the wind, Zach can tell you that working.
[00:12:30] Zach's worked at a lead company.
[00:12:31] He knows it's not usually even the first call that gets it done.
[00:12:34] It might be the sixth or seventh or, you know, anything in between or after.
[00:12:38] But I'm going to give a quick plug.
[00:12:40] I wish I was getting paid by these guys.
[00:12:42] This is one of the, and as Zach, I don't know if you know these guys.
[00:12:44] If not, check them out.
[00:12:45] There's a great group where you can sign.
[00:12:47] If you're having call reluctance and these guys will get you to, they'll tell you exactly what to say on the call.
[00:12:53] They're not just real estate.
[00:12:54] They do all sorts of industries, but called 30 minutes to presidents club, which is 30mpc.com.
[00:13:00] These guys are the real deal.
[00:13:02] They have all the data on what works.
[00:13:03] Anyway, so enough about that.
[00:13:05] But 30mpc.com, check them out.
[00:13:06] I found it to be super cool.
[00:13:08] And we all should be making more calls.
[00:13:09] So great.
[00:13:10] So you were at set schedule.
[00:13:12] You were making a lot of calls there.
[00:13:14] I know that company.
[00:13:15] I know that company.
[00:13:16] 400 hand dials a day.
[00:13:18] Like on an old office phone, we didn't have dialers, you know, like at that point.
[00:13:22] Like I would hold the office phone like this and I would take my pencil.
[00:13:27] And I'd do about 400 dials going through Realtor.com.
[00:13:31] I would just go through Realtor.com, start at the top, go down.
[00:13:34] And my goal was out of 400 dials.
[00:13:36] If I could get like 15 appointments for the next day, then we're in a good spot.
[00:13:41] You know, and that was my goal is about, if I do 15 presentations booked, I knew my math.
[00:13:47] I knew I'd have about six that would show up for that day.
[00:13:50] And if I can pitch six people, I'll close to.
[00:13:53] So it was just simple math.
[00:13:55] I knew what my math was.
[00:13:58] Wow.
[00:13:59] Well, I will tell you, it takes a lot of discipline and just fortitude to power through hundreds
[00:14:06] of dials a day.
[00:14:07] I started that when I, in my first job as financial advisor, well, not my first job,
[00:14:12] but my first job as a financial advisor.
[00:14:13] I was making about 200 dials a day and I thought that was insane.
[00:14:16] And we did not have a dialer either.
[00:14:18] But boy, you really develop, you develop, yeah, thanks.
[00:14:23] You really develop a lot of resiliency.
[00:14:25] And you started, it's almost like, you know, for guys who are afraid, who are single,
[00:14:29] who are afraid to approach a woman and ask for a date, like all you have to do is ask
[00:14:33] about, you know, 20 different women who you find interesting to like chat with, you'll
[00:14:37] realize like, oh, you'll get rejected.
[00:14:39] It's okay.
[00:14:39] It's not the end of the world.
[00:14:40] You're still standing.
[00:14:41] And you know, some of them are married, have boyfriends or just aren't interested in
[00:14:44] you.
[00:14:44] Like, who cares?
[00:14:45] But it feels like it's the end of the world.
[00:14:47] It feels, you know, awful to think, you know, it's what's that anticipation in our mind
[00:14:51] of like, this is going to hurt.
[00:14:53] The reality of it is, it doesn't have to.
[00:14:55] And you know, if you're confident in your own, I'm a good person, I'm a good human being,
[00:14:59] then, you know, making those dials and having somebody go, you're the fifth REALTOR to call
[00:15:03] me today because I have my home FSBO.
[00:15:06] You know, oh, I'm sorry, it didn't mean to bug you.
[00:15:09] I'll keep going, you know, not the end of the world, but I know you've probably had
[00:15:13] your fair share of abuse on the phones.
[00:15:15] And you just kind of shaken off.
[00:15:19] It's not about you.
[00:15:22] You know, I mean, you get in yelled at, said funny things to text messages like yada,
[00:15:27] yada, yada, yada.
[00:15:27] Let me just be super direct with you.
[00:15:30] Anybody on here who's listening about cold calling, it's pretty rare.
[00:15:34] Okay, that you get somebody super rude.
[00:15:36] Okay, on the other hand, nine, and I'm here in California.
[00:15:39] Okay, like trust me, I get rude people.
[00:15:40] Okay, on the phones, like, and it's very rare that someone actually is rude, aggressive,
[00:15:47] or mean to me on the phone.
[00:15:48] Normally, I just like, hey man, no, I'm not interested.
[00:15:50] Thanks.
[00:15:52] And you're on the next, you know, it's not like this big scary thing.
[00:15:54] So I coach, when I coach people on cold calling and on prospecting in general, I'm a very
[00:16:00] strong believer that you need to teach it like you would teach a swim class.
[00:16:04] In the first day of swim class, they put you in the water to show that you're not going
[00:16:09] to drowned.
[00:16:10] So then the next day you come in, you're like, oh my god, it's okay, I'm not going to
[00:16:13] drown.
[00:16:14] Okay, I'll get in the water and everything's okay after that.
[00:16:17] So a lot of people try to learn cold calling off of YouTube, off of videos, but then they
[00:16:21] never take the actual step to try to just make the call and see what, you know, and see
[00:16:26] what happens.
[00:16:27] It's just like, swim class guys, you've got to jump in, watch the YouTube videos.
[00:16:31] Don't get me wrong.
[00:16:32] Like, master your craft, but you need to have some implementation calling to know like,
[00:16:37] oh my god, this person can't kill me on the other side of the phone.
[00:16:39] You know, like, I'm okay here.
[00:16:41] Like, I'm just going to call the next person.
[00:16:44] You know, and everything's fine.
[00:16:46] Plus, too, like, I think, you know, look, we'd love to say that everything is relationships.
[00:16:52] And maybe there are lots of agents that can do that where it's literally their networking
[00:16:56] gurus and they are just, you know, connecting all over the place.
[00:16:59] And if you're that person, god bless you for the rest of us, and especially for the introverts
[00:17:04] out there, like, this is perfect for introverts, right?
[00:17:07] So I believe it or not, I'm an introvert.
[00:17:09] And I like making, I don't like making dials.
[00:17:12] I don't think anyone likes making dials.
[00:17:13] But I like that I don't have to go outside to make dials.
[00:17:17] And I know that I can just go person to person to person.
[00:17:20] But I want to switch gears because you are a big believer in open houses.
[00:17:24] And I love this because I hear it all the time from agents who, I've never really heard
[00:17:30] it from a successful agent, but I've heard it from agents who are maybe newer in the industry
[00:17:34] or maybe they're just not having success they want.
[00:17:36] They're like, yeah, open houses that just doesn't work.
[00:17:38] And I know that they do because I talk to agents like you every day or every other day
[00:17:42] that on the show that literally prove otherwise.
[00:17:45] But tell me about open houses.
[00:17:46] I know that you are like, no, open houses literally print money for you if you do them right.
[00:17:51] So tell us.
[00:17:51] Yeah, so I'll just be really simple.
[00:17:52] You guys, the reason open houses don't work is because you're not hosting open houses.
[00:17:55] You're just hanging out in the house on a Saturday afternoon.
[00:17:57] Okay, there's very, very, very big difference.
[00:18:00] Okay.
[00:18:01] And those two items.
[00:18:02] Last year for 2024, like you said, one of the hardest years for real estate, we paid
[00:18:06] out over $350,000 worth of GCI just from open house seats.
[00:18:11] Okay, so when I say we know open houses work, it's because I know for a fact that they work.
[00:18:16] I'm not here guessing.
[00:18:17] Okay, with you guys, I don't leave paychecks up to guess work.
[00:18:20] Okay, it's just nobody, nobody should want to do that.
[00:18:23] So very simply our open house, we call them mega open house.
[00:18:27] Okay, and it's because it is a mega open house.
[00:18:29] And it also implements in your brain that you're going to have a mega open house this week.
[00:18:33] And I'm not going to go just hang out on the couch.
[00:18:35] Okay, for two, three hours.
[00:18:37] Our open houses start on Wednesday.
[00:18:39] Okay, so if I have an open house on Saturday, my job starts Wednesday.
[00:18:45] Not Saturday morning, one hour before the open house.
[00:18:48] Okay, when I show up.
[00:18:50] So just to kind of walk through some very basic steps and we can deep dive.
[00:18:54] Of course, if you want it, we have Wednesday starts to dial in around the open house.
[00:18:59] So on average, we want to call two to 300 homeowners around that open house
[00:19:04] before the actual open house.
[00:19:06] And if you're on here and you're listening, you're like, oh my God,
[00:19:09] that's so many dials with so many of this.
[00:19:10] I have brand new agents on our team that closed their first escrow in 30 days
[00:19:14] from dialing around an open house.
[00:19:16] Our main price point is 865.
[00:19:18] Okay, so like they're doing just fine.
[00:19:20] And I promise you, it works.
[00:19:23] So just to slow it down a bit.
[00:19:25] So we get an open house, we have a listing, we have an open house.
[00:19:28] Or maybe it's not even our listing.
[00:19:30] Maybe it's somebody else's listing in our office.
[00:19:31] And they're saying, hey, you can do an open house, even better, even better.
[00:19:35] So what Zach is doing is he's getting the phone numbers
[00:19:37] for all the people that are in those immediate surrounding areas
[00:19:40] because, well, he's going to tell us why.
[00:19:43] But I'm going to tell you my idea.
[00:19:44] Why? Because everybody's nosy and wants to see what's inside their neighbor's home.
[00:19:47] But also maybe, you know, obviously facilitate the idea.
[00:19:50] Hmm, maybe I should sell mine.
[00:19:51] But go ahead, tell us why that works.
[00:19:52] All production is derived from one thing and it's conversations.
[00:19:56] And so if I have a reason to call somebody instead of just a cold call,
[00:20:01] I'm going to take that reason.
[00:20:03] And so these calls are much easier than like calling a list of expires.
[00:20:07] Okay, or something like that because I have a reason to call like I really do.
[00:20:11] And so we run the Pick Your Neighbor campaign.
[00:20:14] That's what we like to call it, aka the even nosy neighbor, pick your next person,
[00:20:18] you know, et cetera.
[00:20:19] But I'm just a drop the bomb.
[00:20:20] I'll drop the script.
[00:20:21] It's okay on here right now.
[00:20:22] It's very simple.
[00:20:23] It's, hey, DJ, hey, DJ, this is Zach.
[00:20:25] I'm actually selling your neighbor's house right over the street on two, three,
[00:20:28] three, four, Jupiter.
[00:20:29] I was calling to let you know they're going to have a huge mega open house this weekend.
[00:20:32] Saturday and Sunday, one to four.
[00:20:35] There's going to be a lot more traffic than normal in the neighborhood.
[00:20:38] I just wanted to see by chance, do you know of anybody that wants to come see the house
[00:20:41] or move into the neighborhood?
[00:20:44] So we're on the Pick Your Neighbor campaign and they go, wait, what house are they going,
[00:20:48] no, man, like I'm good, I'm not selling.
[00:20:50] I go, no, I'm actually not calling you about selling.
[00:20:52] I'm calling you about picking your next neighbor and they're like, okay, what?
[00:20:56] What is that?
[00:20:57] What does that mean?
[00:20:58] And so I just run them through it.
[00:21:00] You guys, most of these people are curious.
[00:21:01] You're just, you're trying to sell them on something.
[00:21:03] I'm just trying to create curiosity, you know, is my, is my first step, you know,
[00:21:07] that we're doing here.
[00:21:08] And so I, we run the Pick Your Neighbor campaign.
[00:21:11] A lot of them say, no, we don't have somebody.
[00:21:14] Okay, then wants to come see the house.
[00:21:15] And then I, I drew my backup, which is trying to get them into like a market report,
[00:21:19] you know, inside of our system.
[00:21:21] So I go, hey, DJ, totally understand that you may not have somebody who wants to come see the house.
[00:21:25] What I'd like to do is I'm already doing it for a few of your neighbors
[00:21:27] is I make this really high level and crafted report that I send out every single month.
[00:21:32] It shows homeowners exactly what's going on in the market, exactly what's going on in the community.
[00:21:37] And really, it just gives you all the information a homeowner should know about their home.
[00:21:41] Where should I send that text or email?
[00:21:45] No questions.
[00:21:46] It's not so whether or not they have somebody from my open house as a no,
[00:21:49] I'm then going to get them in my database for a future listing.
[00:21:52] Okay, and it's not rocket science that simple two minute call right there.
[00:21:56] We'll bring you 12 to 15 people into your database per week.
[00:22:01] Easy, easy.
[00:22:03] And those are sellers that know your name, know your voice,
[00:22:06] gave you a valid email.
[00:22:08] And we use fellow shout out to fellow.
[00:22:10] We use them for all of our market reports and Ryan Young is amazing.
[00:22:13] So we just put them into fellow.
[00:22:15] And then they're in fellow and we're good.
[00:22:17] We just follow up every like 90 days.
[00:22:19] You know, it's super simple.
[00:22:20] But so that way you get people that come to your open house.
[00:22:23] Okay, you get to look like a listing agent.
[00:22:25] Even if you're not so for new agents, if you're not calling around open houses saying
[00:22:29] I'm selling your neighbor's house, you're just missing your opportunity to brand as a listing agent.
[00:22:33] They don't know, you know, who has the listing and who doesn't.
[00:22:35] Also, even if they know who has it, who's the impressive listing agent?
[00:22:39] The one calling the homeowners or the one with their name on the side.
[00:22:42] It's the one calling the homeowners.
[00:22:43] And then the third one is it gives you sellers and your database for future, you know, transactions.
[00:22:50] I love the idea too of picking your neighbor because we all care
[00:22:53] who is across the street, right?
[00:22:55] You know, even if we're not going to be buddies with them, we want to at least feel like,
[00:22:59] oh, I like that person.
[00:23:00] If for whatever reason or we certainly don't want to feel like I don't like that person.
[00:23:04] And even though you're right, they're not really going to have somebody
[00:23:06] probably ready to buy that house.
[00:23:08] It at least gets them thinking about, hmm, who do I know?
[00:23:11] Who would be kind of fun to live a car?
[00:23:13] Like in a real subtle way, it's a fun exercise for them to go through in their mind.
[00:23:18] Just because they're like, okay, they're thinking all my buddies.
[00:23:21] Any of them are moving right now.
[00:23:22] You know, I mean, and again, the odds of them actually moving into that home are
[00:23:25] few and far between, but that's not why you're doing it.
[00:23:27] But there's something psychologically kind of satisfying about thinking about
[00:23:31] if I lived by my friends, how cool would that be?
[00:23:34] Like it feels good.
[00:23:34] One else of this we're most agents mess up on this is they call looking for listings.
[00:23:39] An impressive listing agent doesn't call a neighbor that they have a live listing
[00:23:42] in looking to create competition for themselves.
[00:23:44] That just doesn't make sense.
[00:23:46] I hear a lot of agents down to go, Zach, hey, I'm calling.
[00:23:48] No one's saying, hey, this is Greg and I was just wanting to listing your neighbor's house right
[00:23:51] here. It's for sale right now.
[00:23:52] Or have you ever any thoughts about selling your house for looking at offers?
[00:23:55] I'm like, bro, we're way too early for that.
[00:23:56] That's after closing.
[00:23:58] You know that we can do that.
[00:23:59] An impressive agent is focused on that deal.
[00:24:01] And so I'm always trying to sell that house.
[00:24:04] Once they say no, and they disqualify themselves from being a candidate for the house,
[00:24:10] now I can move into trying to be a listing agent and talk to them about their home.
[00:24:14] But that's where a lot of agents miss that step.
[00:24:16] People want to hire an impressive listing agent to sell their home.
[00:24:19] They're not trying to just call an agent that's calling around.
[00:24:22] You know, yeah, yeah.
[00:24:22] So don't call around for more listings in the neighborhood.
[00:24:25] Call just being the impressive listing agent trying to sell the home because that's your job
[00:24:30] in the first place.
[00:24:31] And they feel that on the phone.
[00:24:33] And that's why they remember you.
[00:24:35] And they don't remember the random guy that sold the home in the neighborhood like 30 days prior.
[00:24:40] Plus they're now thinking, wow, this guy's like really a go-getter.
[00:24:44] Like he's literally calling all of us in the name like no other agents want to do that.
[00:24:49] So I mean the reality but is it's not like there's a lot of other competition.
[00:24:52] You know, if there's another open house next door to your open house,
[00:24:55] odds are that person across street is getting one phone call yours.
[00:24:58] And they're probably like, hey, that kid's pretty good.
[00:25:02] You know, he's working hard and it's just it's very it's an impressive thing.
[00:25:08] I think and it's not invasive.
[00:25:09] You're not asking for anything.
[00:25:10] You're just saying, hey, I just want to let you know.
[00:25:12] That's why he's saying, hey, you know what?
[00:25:14] I should yeah, and I shoot out this thing that'll help you to kind of always let you know what your home is worth.
[00:25:18] What's going on in the neighborhood?
[00:25:19] Where do you want me to sign it like easy?
[00:25:21] Now you got the open house.
[00:25:23] You've called the neighbors on when I'm sorry.
[00:25:25] I don't want to maybe we skip this.
[00:25:27] No, no.
[00:25:27] So is there anything you're starting that on Wednesday?
[00:25:30] I've got a Wednesday having the open house.
[00:25:31] That's going to take Wednesday and Thursday and part usually part of Friday.
[00:25:37] Okay, it's a lot of people, you know, doing two, three hundred dials doesn't go super quick.
[00:25:41] Unless you have like a dialer, obviously you can do it a lot faster.
[00:25:44] Then we're also going to mega study the house itself.
[00:25:48] Okay, so when I say that house, not just the details like the square footage and the bedrooms and the baths,
[00:25:54] like I'm talking knowledge bomb something that they cannot find.
[00:25:58] So I'm talking like the house that sold down the street three months ago.
[00:26:02] I want to know all the areas that's what is the average for sale or what is the average
[00:26:06] of over this price that it sells or under this price.
[00:26:10] What is the average days on market in here?
[00:26:12] Did the last one fall out of escrow at any point?
[00:26:14] I'm going to call the agents before I host the last listing agents on the other listings that sold
[00:26:19] in there and literally say, hey, how did your last sale go?
[00:26:23] Like I am going to be D inside scoop.
[00:26:26] So when they walk in my open house, they are like, holy moly.
[00:26:31] They are just like, it's impossible not to get impressed.
[00:26:36] Walking in there because the average agent knows how it's a three bedroom, two bath,
[00:26:40] 1,500 square feet, and it's a single story home.
[00:26:42] We're like, thanks point Dexter for letting me know the house I just came to see.
[00:26:45] Like I'm sorry, but it's just, you know, I'm not going to be rude.
[00:26:48] The things I can already see for myself.
[00:26:50] The agents are becoming a commodity because of that.
[00:26:52] That's my big word here for agents on our team.
[00:26:55] We focus on not being a commodity, which means we have to have information.
[00:26:58] They can't just get from Zillow.
[00:27:00] You know, aka, the closed calms, the average over all these little things.
[00:27:05] I want that information.
[00:27:07] So when they come in, it just comes out in your language.
[00:27:09] You don't even need to try to use it.
[00:27:11] Your brain wants to show off.
[00:27:12] So you're literally calling the listing agents.
[00:27:16] Are you also calling the buy side agents for the deals that happen?
[00:27:19] Really depends.
[00:27:20] If it's like a really niche area or something like that, I would.
[00:27:22] But if it's like a standard cookie cutter, I'll call one or two listing agents,
[00:27:25] get some, you know, see how their last sales were.
[00:27:28] So when somebody comes in, I go, hey, you know, DJ, I know you said that this is maybe a perfect house for you guys.
[00:27:33] I just want to let you know the last house that sold down there had 17 offers closed
[00:27:37] escrow in 10 days.
[00:27:39] So this is a pretty aggressive neighborhood.
[00:27:41] And let me ask you, what do you think you want to offer on the home?
[00:27:44] And it creates that, oh my god, I'm working with the right person.
[00:27:47] You know, is what it does.
[00:27:48] Yeah.
[00:27:49] I love that.
[00:27:50] And so by the way, back to the cold call just for a second, I wanted to ask this.
[00:27:53] What if somebody says, what's a mega open house?
[00:27:56] What's the answer to that?
[00:27:57] So my personal response that I do this like, oh, my god, I'm so sorry that you haven't
[00:28:01] been able to witness in a mega open house before.
[00:28:04] So I give this like a apology like, oh, my god, so sorry you haven't been invited before.
[00:28:08] And they're like, what?
[00:28:09] And I go, a mega open house is when we're selling a home and we open the doors for business for
[00:28:15] the weekend and our number one goal is to create a traffic jam.
[00:28:19] So I go, I apologize, you know, and that's why I'm calling the neighborhood in advance is because my
[00:28:24] literal goal with selling your neighbor's house is you created traffic jam of people coming in.
[00:28:30] So I create the highest comp possible for the community, which obviously affects your home,
[00:28:35] 
[00:28:35] And affects their home and makes the whole world go around.
[00:28:38] So I kind of just give that like, hey, so sorry you haven't heard of this before.
[00:28:41] Wow, like, let me tell you what this is.
[00:28:44] And I just, you know, I talk about the traffic jam because we've done that multiple times where
[00:28:48] we've literally caused traffic jams, you know, in neighborhoods.
[00:28:51] So I think it's a cool picture in people's heads.
[00:28:55] You know, it's like, wait, a traffic jam.
[00:28:57] They start picturing this open house with all these cars, like kind of colliding in and, you know,
[00:29:01] coming in and so that's usually my little mini explanation.
[00:29:06] So Zach just did something very skillful and it's a subtle thing that you might not have picked up on
[00:29:11] and I want to address this because if you identify the structure of what he's doing, you can apply this
[00:29:16] all throughout the sales marketing process or the sales cycle.
[00:29:20] Zach did something very, very clever.
[00:29:21] He identified a future problem for the guy across the street.
[00:29:26] And offered a solution or offered a reason why it's actually a benefit to that person.
[00:29:32] So he said, hey, I'm really sorry, you know, just so you know, there's, there's going to be a lot of
[00:29:36] traffic that day.
[00:29:37] You know, I apologize for that.
[00:29:38] And the reason I'm doing that is because I want as many offers as I can for that house because I want
[00:29:43] to drive up those comps so that you as well, the whole neighborhood will benefit from this.
[00:29:48] So he basically identified a potential issue where people go, I don't want to deal with a traffic
[00:29:52] jam for my neighbor's house.
[00:29:53] It cares.
[00:29:54] And then Zach goes, here's why you need to care.
[00:29:56] And here's why it's a minor inconvenience.
[00:29:58] And he basically just solved that entire, brought up a problem and addressed it and solved it
[00:30:03] and made it worth the person's time to go, oh, that's pretty cool.
[00:30:07] Okay, cool.
[00:30:08] So I love that.
[00:30:09] My favorite line here, everybody should remember this.
[00:30:12] The only thing you should be thinking that's in your prospect's head is what's in this for me.
[00:30:16] They could care less than himself on their neighbor's house and have an open house and all this.
[00:30:21] So like I said, it's just this big inconvenience until I make it about them.
[00:30:25] Okay, so it's really important.
[00:30:26] One of my favorite phrases is this benefits you because, because everyone will be like,
[00:30:32] oh, my God, I have this amazing open house and this.
[00:30:36] And then they'll hike up all this stuff.
[00:30:37] And then the homeowners just like, that sounds cool.
[00:30:39] And I go, the reason this benefits you is because, because it's all about you is because I'm
[00:30:43] going to boost the comps in the neighborhood.
[00:30:45] I'm going to break a neighborhood sale record.
[00:30:47] And I'm going to bring so much traffic in here that we're going to have so many offers
[00:30:51] that you may even want to look at one of those offers on your home.
[00:30:54] Like I'm just I'm hitting it hard.
[00:30:57] You know, like, hey, this is valuable for you to not just that homeowner,
[00:31:02] but it's that key phrase that it's valued to you because, you know, and you get that reason.
[00:31:08] This is why you should care about it, essentially, because they don't care unless you tell them why they should care.
[00:31:13] And everyone has that number that even though they don't want to move and they're not looking to list their home,
[00:31:21] everyone's got that number that if somebody threw that at them, they would move.
[00:31:25] Even they would give up that three percent mortgage if that number was high enough.
[00:31:29] And so it really gets the person thinking, Zack's driving up the comp,
[00:31:33] he's going to eat once a bidding war.
[00:31:35] Gosh, you know, maybe I should check out see what's going on here.
[00:31:37] See what this guy's all about because maybe somebody would want to throw me a number that's pretty insane.
[00:31:41] So brilliant all the way around.
[00:31:43] Oh my gosh.
[00:31:44] So much value.
[00:31:45] I'm in the open house yet.
[00:31:47] Okay, so now let's get to the open house.
[00:31:49] So now you're at the open house.
[00:31:50] People are coming in.
[00:31:51] Okay, so our one house has a few factors.
[00:31:53] One first off is signage.
[00:31:55] Okay, I ask a lot of agents.
[00:31:57] How many signs do you put out?
[00:31:58] And my I'd say the average answer here is between five and maybe like eight,
[00:32:03] you know, signs that people are putting out.
[00:32:05] So we have a minimum of 50.
[00:32:07] Okay, that we put out.
[00:32:08] So we hire a sign guy, like a new build guy who for our team list things,
[00:32:15] we go and have 50 signs put out.
[00:32:17] And that does not include the 15 signs that the agent's going to bring with their name,
[00:32:22] their phone number for inside of the neighborhood.
[00:32:24] So sometimes we'll have up to 65 signs for an open house.
[00:32:27] I know some of you guys are like rolling your eyes.
[00:32:29] Well, of course they're busy.
[00:32:31] You can put out 65 signs.
[00:32:32] You guys, before we had a sign guy, our agents were doing this.
[00:32:36] We're just all about raising the value of our agents times.
[00:32:39] You're like, I used to have an agent that would go to the signs at five in the morning.
[00:32:42] She would drive out, put out signs at like four or five a.m.
[00:32:46] when it's still dark out, no cars on the road, hammer everything.
[00:32:50] And then she'd be good, you know, it would take her like not that long.
[00:32:53] She's just being smart with her time.
[00:32:55] But so I know it sounds like a lot.
[00:32:58] But when an agent to the left of me has an open house that had three people through it,
[00:33:03] and then my agent to the right had 80.
[00:33:07] 80 people through and that's not something.
[00:33:09] Number last weekend literally on a Saturday, Sunday, sorry,
[00:33:12] not even a Saturday, Sunday, our agent resident had 80 people through his open house.
[00:33:18] I'm willing to put in the few extra hours to get 80 people through my open house.
[00:33:22] So signage is huge.
[00:33:23] Okay, I highly suggest get bright colors.
[00:33:26] We do like neon pink, neon blue, green, like the,
[00:33:30] our brand colors are black and gold.
[00:33:32] I wish we could do those everywhere, but they blend in.
[00:33:34] They do. They just, you know, people don't read any of the writing or anything.
[00:33:38] They just see a big arrow, you know, and they point in.
[00:33:41] So we're going from the freeway all the way to the house, typically.
[00:33:46] Like we want to get people down that whole windy road, you know,
[00:33:49] in and then inside the neighborhood, we have our agents put 15 of their branded signs,
[00:33:55] their face, their name, their phone number.
[00:33:57] Because if all they have to do is
[00:34:00] sign inside of a neighborhood with 15 signs,
[00:34:04] you'll do that no problem.
[00:34:06] You know, that's 30, that's 30 minutes right there,
[00:34:08] you know, just to put those out.
[00:34:10] And it's really dense.
[00:34:11] So basically, the cars are just following following arrows.
[00:34:15] I drove by a new build and said,
[00:34:17] why the heck are they allowed to have 100 signs out in 10 foot flags and all this stuff
[00:34:22] and we can't?
[00:34:23] And so I looked into and I was like, oh, we can.
[00:34:25] People just don't do it.
[00:34:27] And so we have said 217 foot tall flags that we put right in the front of the house.
[00:34:31] Okay, they're super easy and you don't want Amazon of like 60 bucks.
[00:34:35] You know, or something like that.
[00:34:36] We just, wham, stick them in.
[00:34:38] And people drive by and it looks like a freaking carnival.
[00:34:41] Dude, like it just like it is.
[00:34:42] Like it looks like they're like, okay, whatever, there's an open house.
[00:34:45] Oh my god, there's the same sign.
[00:34:47] Oh my god, there's three of the same sign.
[00:34:49] Oh my god, we're going into our neighborhood and there's five signs 10 feet apart
[00:34:52] all point in here.
[00:34:53] Like I have to go inside.
[00:34:54] Like I have to.
[00:34:56] So we're forcing plus how impressive.
[00:34:59] I'm sorry to interrupt it.
[00:35:00] Plus how impressive that looks to the neighbors.
[00:35:02] Right?
[00:35:03] Like we might be thinking, ooh, that's a little much, that's a little much.
[00:35:06] But and yes, maybe it is much to some people.
[00:35:09] But if you're selling your home, you want much.
[00:35:12] You want as many people coming by as possible.
[00:35:14] So what you're really doing is conditioning the neighbors to go,
[00:35:17] this is how much I care.
[00:35:18] And nobody else has done this before.
[00:35:20] They've seen other homes for sale.
[00:35:21] It's quiet.
[00:35:22] There's one home and there's a sign in the yard.
[00:35:24] And that's probably about it.
[00:35:25] They're not seeing this level of activity.
[00:35:27] And they're like, wow, this guy's really putting me down.
[00:35:29] You guys are average days on market right now.
[00:35:32] It's 14 days.
[00:35:33] And that's all of 2024 to this first quarter of 2025 average.
[00:35:39] And that's with a medium price point.
[00:35:40] Like set of right below $900,000.
[00:35:43] So like when I say we know how to sell homes,
[00:35:46] like we and we're all about quick, highest number possible.
[00:35:50] Sitting on market this 100 days, 120 days.
[00:35:54] Like it's just if you take your per an hour value there,
[00:35:57] like all you're doing is lowering your value.
[00:35:59] So we hit super hard, super impressive.
[00:36:03] Okay, super high level right in the beginning.
[00:36:06] Big flags, lots of signs, calling the neighbors.
[00:36:10] And then we finally get to the open house.
[00:36:13] Okay, and here's the key.
[00:36:15] If you guys have a pen and paper, I'll write this down.
[00:36:17] I'm about to drop the $300,000 script on you right now.
[00:36:20] Okay, no joke.
[00:36:21] This paid out $300,000 last year in GCI.
[00:36:24] They walk in the open house.
[00:36:26] And I go, hi, my name is Zach.
[00:36:29] So nice to meet you.
[00:36:30] Welcome to my open house.
[00:36:31] What's your name?
[00:36:32] DJ, awesome.
[00:36:33] DJ, so nice to meet you.
[00:36:35] Okay, this house is a three bedroom, two baths,
[00:36:37] 1500 square foot.
[00:36:38] Here's the flyer with all the information on the home.
[00:36:40] It has an ocean view deck off the top bedroom.
[00:36:43] I highly suggest you go check it out.
[00:36:45] And it's got a dog around over on the left hand side.
[00:36:47] So I suggest you go see that as well.
[00:36:48] Take as much time walk around the open house as you would like.
[00:36:52] I just asked one favor though.
[00:36:54] Can you meet me by the kitchen counter before you leave?
[00:36:57] So I can ask you a few questions about the home.
[00:36:59] They go, yeah, of course.
[00:37:01] No problem.
[00:37:01] I just gave you everything you wanted.
[00:37:04] People walk in an open house.
[00:37:06] I hear the agent, can you sign in please?
[00:37:09] Oh, hey, can you sign in please?
[00:37:11] Oh no, you have to sign in to get in.
[00:37:13] Okay, the people come in.
[00:37:15] I give them everything they want.
[00:37:17] I asked them my favor, which they say, of course, too,
[00:37:20] because I just gave them everything.
[00:37:22] The second they turn their body away from me, I go,
[00:37:26] oh, DJ, really quick.
[00:37:27] Can I get you to sign in for the homeowner?
[00:37:31] And what they just go and their brain,
[00:37:35] of course, wasn't the first priority was just to get me to sign up for some
[00:37:38] sheet. It was a second.
[00:37:40] It's like almost an afterthought.
[00:37:41] After a second.
[00:37:42] So sure, I'm going to go put in my real phone number,
[00:37:44] my real email, my real name, because this guy seems like a good guy.
[00:37:50] Like he's not trying to just go meet through a registration seat and then
[00:37:53] calling me a few days later.
[00:37:54] You know, I'm blowing me up.
[00:37:56] Like, so you guys, they're also, I'm sorry if anybody feels called out by this.
[00:38:00] Okay, but the worst question in real estate that humanly exists is what brought you in today.
[00:38:09] What are you expecting them to say?
[00:38:11] I just don't get, oh, I'm here to buy a house.
[00:38:13] Like, I just, you know, like, it's like, I'm assuming you're here to buy a house.
[00:38:17] You're inside an open house.
[00:38:18] So people walk in and I hear agents all the time, like, what brought you in today?
[00:38:22] Like, oh, we're just looking.
[00:38:23] And you're like, okay, shoot, okay.
[00:38:25] And instantly cuts it.
[00:38:27] You're just setting yourself up.
[00:38:29] But failure is to go.
[00:38:29] Instead of what brought you in today, move that over to the side and just, hey, gratitude.
[00:38:36] Thank you so much for coming into my open house today.
[00:38:39] I'm so grateful that you were able to come see me and my business.
[00:38:44] Today, not hence, I don't have to hang out in the corner on Instagram for three hours and
[00:38:48] not get paid for any of my time.
[00:38:50] Thank you so much for coming in.
[00:38:52] Like, so grateful for you coming in my open house today.
[00:38:56] And you start with gratitude.
[00:38:57] Yeah.
[00:38:59] You know, it's funny.
[00:39:00] I think as you were saying this idea of, you know, the O by the way,
[00:39:04] oh, well, real quickly.
[00:39:05] Could I get your, you know, your email address?
[00:39:08] You know, I think about this.
[00:39:09] There's so many applications for this.
[00:39:11] You know, it's thinking the same idea when you walk into a clothing store.
[00:39:14] And the salesperson comes up and the last thing you want them to do is come right up to you.
[00:39:18] Because you're like, I don't even know what I'm looking at yet.
[00:39:20] I, yeah, I'm here.
[00:39:22] But what they could do is they come and say, hey, hey, I know you, I know you want to start browsing.
[00:39:26] I'm going to let you do that.
[00:39:27] Here's where you men's clothes over here, over here, over here.
[00:39:30] I'm going to leave you alone.
[00:39:31] Just wanted to let you know where things were.
[00:39:33] I'm here if you need me.
[00:39:34] And then they, they can, okay, cool.
[00:39:36] They go, oh, by the way, we send out a lot of coupons and offers.
[00:39:39] Can I just grab your email real quick and then it's the same exact idea.
[00:39:43] And I don't know why restaurants don't do this before they see you.
[00:39:46] I don't, I mean, there's so much opportunity here.
[00:39:48] So that is the easy one.
[00:39:50] Because obviously everybody talks about car sales and like, you know, us being
[00:39:53] used car salesman.
[00:39:54] I know some great used car salesman.
[00:39:56] You guys just for everybody out there.
[00:39:58] But we have this wrap, you know, like that.
[00:40:00] So I tell everybody, imagine even me, I go to a car lot and I go, oh, my God,
[00:40:05] where, where is he going to come out of?
[00:40:07] He's going to pop out of the back of the truck because he's going to walk from the corner.
[00:40:10] Like, where is this guy going to come out of and not leave me alone?
[00:40:13] Because it is like a stereotype for that.
[00:40:15] And even I think it like an I'm in sales.
[00:40:16] So I imagine this and I told this to a car sale guy and he crushes it.
[00:40:21] Imagine somebody walks on the lot.
[00:40:23] They walked up and they said, hey, DJ, really quick.
[00:40:27] I'm going to let you look around and take as much time as you would need.
[00:40:31] I just wanted to give you a quick update.
[00:40:33] So all the Toyota's are over here.
[00:40:35] All the midside bands over here, the trucks okay, are back over there.
[00:40:39] Once again, take as much time to look around as you'd like.
[00:40:42] I just asked one favor.
[00:40:44] Can you stop by the front office before you go?
[00:40:46] That way I can just ask you a few questions about your vehicle purchase.
[00:40:49] And they're like, we'd be like, oh my God.
[00:40:51] Yeah, easy.
[00:40:52] 
[00:40:52] Thank you.
[00:40:52] They'd be like, that's amazing.
[00:40:53] And then as I turn around and be like, oh, really quick.
[00:40:56] Could I get your contact information?
[00:40:58] Just like it sends you over.
[00:41:00] Like we have some cars.
[00:41:00] We're doing some amazing deals on it.
[00:41:02] And then you get it.
[00:41:03] It's like the secondary thought and they feel.
[00:41:06] Yeah, love it.
[00:41:06] So that's crucial.
[00:41:09] Stop forcing people to sign in right when they walk in the house.
[00:41:13] Give them all the value first.
[00:41:15] Log reparsity kicks in and they end up giving you what you want back now.
[00:41:19] You know, without even thinking about it.
[00:41:22] I love it.
[00:41:23] Okay.
[00:41:24] So any other tips for the open house or is that basically is at the,
[00:41:28] oh, are you do you have are you have refreshments?
[00:41:30] Do you have food?
[00:41:31] What are you doing?
[00:41:32] I'm looking for a drink.
[00:41:33] I'm looking for a drink.
[00:41:34] Look good.
[00:41:34] Feel good.
[00:41:35] Smell good.
[00:41:35] That goes for you and for the house.
[00:41:37] Okay.
[00:41:37] That's a rule of thumb.
[00:41:39] You should look good.
[00:41:40] Feel good.
[00:41:41] And hopefully you smell good.
[00:41:42] Okay.
[00:41:42] Same with the house.
[00:41:43] Hopefully it should look good.
[00:41:45] It's cleaned.
[00:41:46] Okay.
[00:41:46] There's not stuff everywhere.
[00:41:48] You have the closets closed.
[00:41:49] The toilet seats down.
[00:41:51] You know, windows open.
[00:41:53] Feel good.
[00:41:54] Okay.
[00:41:54] Get it a good temperature in there.
[00:41:56] Nobody wants to walk in this freaking, you know,
[00:41:58] warm, sweaty, you know, open house.
[00:42:01] Okay.
[00:42:02] And then smell good.
[00:42:03] Make it smell good.
[00:42:04] You guys, you don't need to don't go spray for breeze everywhere.
[00:42:07] Okay.
[00:42:07] That just suffocates people like just go.
[00:42:10] I literally got stuff one time at open house.
[00:42:12] The smell terrible.
[00:42:12] I didn't have anything on me.
[00:42:14] I literally they had a bunch of lemons.
[00:42:16] So I turn on the hot water and just squeeze a ton of lemons
[00:42:20] like in the sinks and stuff.
[00:42:21] And the house smell like fresh lemons.
[00:42:22] One of the best feedback I got actually was,
[00:42:24] wow, the house smells great.
[00:42:26] I was like, thanks.
[00:42:27] You know, appreciate it.
[00:42:28] But so look good.
[00:42:29] Feel good.
[00:42:29] It smells good.
[00:42:30] Okay.
[00:42:31] Feel good.
[00:42:31] Would mean music.
[00:42:33] You know, the echoes.
[00:42:34] You walk in an open house and you're,
[00:42:37] you hear yourself echoing in the room.
[00:42:38] Nobody wants to be there.
[00:42:40] Okay.
[00:42:40] This so they get out as if it could possibly.
[00:42:41] Right.
[00:42:42] Food.
[00:42:43] You know, we don't do like,
[00:42:44] we don't do like big cookie platters.
[00:42:46] You know, anything like that.
[00:42:47] We'll do like some chocolates or, you know,
[00:42:50] something really small, you know,
[00:42:51] an easy and then drinks.
[00:42:53] This is our big trick.
[00:42:54] A lot of people I walk in,
[00:42:55] they got like a $60 bottle of champagne.
[00:42:57] And I'm just like, damn, man,
[00:42:59] you're like, you know, like I guess you're crushing it.
[00:43:01] You know, your open house is,
[00:43:02] you guys, we use $2 bottles of champagne.
[00:43:05] Like buy a bunch of bottles of champagne.
[00:43:07] They're not there for the quality of champagne.
[00:43:09] They're there for the house.
[00:43:10] The champagne's about that.
[00:43:11] Okay.
[00:43:11] So get yourself some cheap champagne,
[00:43:13] you know, poured in some glasses
[00:43:15] and just look good, feel good, smell good.
[00:43:18] You're running a good open house at that point.
[00:43:22] Love it.
[00:43:23] So now they've left the open house.
[00:43:25] They've gone about their day.
[00:43:26] You've got their contact information.
[00:43:28] Maybe they stopped by and talked to you or maybe they didn't,
[00:43:30] but you've got the info.
[00:43:31] So it doesn't matter.
[00:43:34] So by the way, just had a curiosity.
[00:43:36] What percentage stop by you on the way out?
[00:43:40] I know you don't probably care so much about it,
[00:43:42] but just curious.
[00:43:43] Like what percentage actually?
[00:43:43] Okay, a question because everybody thinks it's really low.
[00:43:45] They think it's like 50% 25.
[00:43:48] If I've not been thrown out there,
[00:43:49] it's like over 80%.
[00:43:50] I'm not even joking.
[00:43:52] As long as you nail,
[00:43:53] what that is so,
[00:43:54] I'm showing you it shocking because it's,
[00:43:56] well, it's two parts on this.
[00:43:58] Okay, one, it's the law of reprocity.
[00:44:00] Okay, sure, that part's really important.
[00:44:02] You gave them everything.
[00:44:03] You made their life easy.
[00:44:04] What happens when you make someone's life easy
[00:44:05] as they make your life easy and return?
[00:44:07] Okay, and they don't make your life hard.
[00:44:08] You make somebody's life hard.
[00:44:09] AKA you force them to sign in within the first two seconds.
[00:44:12] You just made their life harder.
[00:44:15] They're going to make your life harder
[00:44:16] and they're going to get the heck out of that open house.
[00:44:18] You know, not answer the phone for you.
[00:44:19] Not to talk to you.
[00:44:19] Give you a fake phone number.
[00:44:21] AKA my life is harder now because of that.
[00:44:23] The second one,
[00:44:24] this is the key word here is favor.
[00:44:29] Favours make people feel good.
[00:44:31] People like doing favors for other people.
[00:44:34] Now, a request is very different.
[00:44:37] Hey, DJ, I'm going to ask that you meet me
[00:44:39] by the kitchen counter before you leave.
[00:44:41] That's very different.
[00:44:42] Yeah, that doesn't feel the same.
[00:44:44] It's a request is very different.
[00:44:46] We actually don't like requests.
[00:44:48] We don't like when people request things
[00:44:49] from us,
[00:44:49] it's a home evaluation or a showing.
[00:44:53] But it's that favor.
[00:44:55] Hey, DJ, would you mind doing me a favor?
[00:44:58] And they go, yeah, of course.
[00:45:00] I go, now it feels weird when I go meet me
[00:45:03] by the kitchen, I go, yeah, of course, that'd be great.
[00:45:05] It feels weird for them to just leave.
[00:45:07] Like they're like, okay, could we got to stop?
[00:45:09] You know, we got to at least stop and say hi.
[00:45:11] The second they walk up to the counter,
[00:45:13] this is super important.
[00:45:15] Because this is your ending really to your open house.
[00:45:17] Okay, they walk up to the counter, they walk up.
[00:45:20] I go, hey, DJ,
[00:45:22] wow, you guys got some time to look around the house.
[00:45:24] Let me ask you, do you want to write an offer?
[00:45:28] Okay, your worst question is, how did you like the house?
[00:45:31] That's a hard question to answer.
[00:45:32] Yeah, right.
[00:45:34] Nobody wants to answer that.
[00:45:36] Well, then they start thinking about the downfall.
[00:45:38] There's things I like, there's things I didn't like.
[00:45:40] I just got heart.
[00:45:41] I like yes or no questions to start always.
[00:45:44] Yes or no.
[00:45:45] So hey, DJ, ranking the house on a scale, you know,
[00:45:49] a one to 10, you know, what would you rank the home at?
[00:45:52] Eight, awesome, exciting, doesn't it mean you want to write an offer?
[00:45:57] Okay, you have to ask about the offer.
[00:45:59] I see so many people just letting people leave up the open house.
[00:46:02] Like I'll call them later, you know, and I'll follow up with them.
[00:46:05] Nobody good.
[00:46:06] No, not at all.
[00:46:08] Like my successful open house on the Saturday means I signed an agreement.
[00:46:11] I'm or I'm writing an offer and I get a lot of kick back on this
[00:46:14] from other teams, other agents, other everything.
[00:46:17] Where they're like, it's kind of pushy, you know, and it's kind of this.
[00:46:20] I go tell that to all my agents that have escros right now for open houses
[00:46:23] on the open house they held.
[00:46:25] And all they're doing is, oh, yeah, you want to write an offer?
[00:46:27] They go, yeah, it's actually a really nice house.
[00:46:29] And they go awesome.
[00:46:30] Has anyone walked you through the seven steps of a winning offer?
[00:46:33] They haven't.
[00:46:34] Oh my gosh, we need to set up a call later tonight when I'm done with the open house
[00:46:37] and work on this winning offer for you.
[00:46:39] But you just need to ask you guys in this in this world.
[00:46:42] You need to ask what you want.
[00:46:43] You can't just expect it to fall in your lap.
[00:46:45] So if you're not asking them for you want, they're not going to give it to you.
[00:46:49] I want to write an offer on this house.
[00:46:52] So I'm going to ask people to write an offer on this house.
[00:46:55] And one of them is probably going to do it.
[00:46:57] Yeah, it's funny.
[00:46:59] I was when I moved into my, when I moved into the condo I currently live in.
[00:47:04] It was a new development and the developer or actually a representative for the developer
[00:47:07] came along on one of the show.
[00:47:09] He says he had to let us in because it was still being constructed
[00:47:11] and they had certain access that couldn't get to.
[00:47:13] So he walks us over and he's not the, he's not the agent.
[00:47:17] He's just the guy working for the developer.
[00:47:20] And we asked him, what about this or this?
[00:47:22] We asked our agent, what about this or this or this?
[00:47:24] Because we didn't know all the answers.
[00:47:26] And he says write an offer and find out.
[00:47:29] And he was kind of being cheeky and a little funny.
[00:47:32] And I was like, yeah, that's a good point.
[00:47:34] He probably would, they're going to answer these questions,
[00:47:36] which were like, could you do this for us?
[00:47:37] Could you do this for us?
[00:47:38] They want to see that we're serious.
[00:47:40] And it made me think, holy crap, I got to write an offer because,
[00:47:43] and he's a good guy.
[00:47:44] I didn't think he was being pushed.
[00:47:45] He was just trying to get these things sold.
[00:47:47] And there's something about this idea that what you said is,
[00:47:51] is, are you, are you ready to make an offer?
[00:47:53] Would you like to make an offer?
[00:47:54] Is your presupposing that people want to make offers?
[00:47:58] And psychologically, there's a little bit of a,
[00:48:01] of an urgency aspect to it.
[00:48:03] Now again, you're not a creepy sales guy.
[00:48:05] So you don't have to worry about being a creepy sales guy.
[00:48:07] You're just not.
[00:48:08] So you can say things that maybe other person
[00:48:10] might sound like a creepy sales guy doing it.
[00:48:12] Don't worry, you're not that person.
[00:48:13] You're a good person.
[00:48:14] So this idea of, hey, do you want to make an offer?
[00:48:18] And it's not, I'm trying to sell you this home.
[00:48:21] It's just so, you know, first of all,
[00:48:22] they're going to see all the traffic going in and out.
[00:48:24] They're going to understand that there's urgency
[00:48:26] and you're actually helping them.
[00:48:28] You're actually saying, hey, would you,
[00:48:31] are you thinking about making an offer?
[00:48:33] You know, it's important that I know this
[00:48:35] because there's a lot of people coming through.
[00:48:37] You know what I'm saying?
[00:48:38] Once again, this is a big one.
[00:48:40] You guys, you're selling the house.
[00:48:42] That's your job.
[00:48:44] Your job isn't for the buyer's agent
[00:48:46] and standing inside of an open house.
[00:48:48] That doesn't make a ton of sense.
[00:48:49] So like, I see a lot.
[00:48:51] Buyers walk up to the counter or they call their,
[00:48:54] you know, the open house, you know,
[00:48:56] visitor like a few days after some like that.
[00:48:59] And they're just like, so why don't you break down
[00:49:00] for me what you're looking for in a home?
[00:49:02] I'm like, bro, how about sell that house first?
[00:49:04] You know, in the second they say no to that house,
[00:49:07] then I can be the buyer's agent.
[00:49:09] So if I go, hey, DJ, do you want to write an offer
[00:49:11] on this house?
[00:49:12] You like them?
[00:49:13] They go, oh, no, no, no, no, we just started looking.
[00:49:16] How exciting.
[00:49:17] Why don't you break down for me what you're looking for
[00:49:19] in a new home?
[00:49:20] Now I can be the buyer's agent, you know,
[00:49:23] and step in and be this, but you guys,
[00:49:24] people want to work with an impressive agent in general.
[00:49:28] So be the impressive agent, your job that you're there.
[00:49:31] Okay, to be at a K selling the house.
[00:49:34] So try to sell the house.
[00:49:35] Okay, be like being inside of a target.
[00:49:38] You walk inside a target.
[00:49:40] You're like, hey, I want to check out with this closing.
[00:49:41] I'm like, hey, do you actually know they have this cheaper
[00:49:45] over at Walmart?
[00:49:46] I'd be like, you're weird.
[00:49:47] I'd be like, what, I just want to buy this right now.
[00:49:49] Like I just, what, I don't know, that's weird to me.
[00:49:50] I'm not going to go drive to Walmart now.
[00:49:52] Like you should be selling me on this shirt
[00:49:54] that I have in my hand, you know, right here.
[00:49:56] So that's what you're doing inside of the open house.
[00:49:58] So you're literally somebody's walking into Best Buy
[00:50:00] and you're saying it's cheaper over at Target.
[00:50:03] It's just weird.
[00:50:04] Yeah, it's weird.
[00:50:05] Okay, so they, so now they've left.
[00:50:08] You've got their contact information at the beginning.
[00:50:11] You 80% of the time are getting some sort of conversation
[00:50:15] at the end of the open house,
[00:50:17] which is finding out how interested they are,
[00:50:19] whether they want to make an offer on this one
[00:50:21] or they're looking at other properties,
[00:50:22] either way, it's a win for you.
[00:50:24] You know, if they have another agent,
[00:50:26] obviously you'll find that out.
[00:50:27] And then now the open house is concluded.
[00:50:30] So now what's the follow up process?
[00:50:33] What are you doing that either evening or next?
[00:50:36] My favorite, one of my favorite parts of the process,
[00:50:39] typically because of the face I get,
[00:50:41] when we talk about it, 21 touches and seven days.
[00:50:45] Okay, is what an open house should have seven,
[00:50:48] the following seven days.
[00:50:50] Okay, I've come in and you're open house.
[00:50:51] That's gonna be calls, that's gonna be emails,
[00:50:53] that's gonna be text messages,
[00:50:54] it's gonna be property alerts,
[00:50:55] it's gonna be videos.
[00:50:56] Okay, so our actual plan,
[00:50:58] and once again, you guys can literally write this down.
[00:51:00] Okay, is the day of the open house,
[00:51:03] not Monday, okay, Saturday after the open house,
[00:51:08] we're calling them.
[00:51:10] If they don't answer the phone,
[00:51:12] we're taking a video from inside the open house.
[00:51:16] Okay, so a lot of our agents will just do this
[00:51:17] before they leave the open house.
[00:51:19] Okay, they take the video and say,
[00:51:21] hey, DJ, it was such a pleasure meeting
[00:51:23] at my open house today.
[00:51:24] I just want to, you know, I'm working hard
[00:51:26] on exactly what we talked about,
[00:51:28] and I'd love to set up, you know, whatever it is.
[00:51:30] You know, it's there, but so it's a call,
[00:51:31] they don't answer.
[00:51:32] Then they get a text with a video
[00:51:35] and they're getting a property alert all in the same day,
[00:51:37] no matter what.
[00:51:39] Like that is the key.
[00:51:40] So it's three touches right there.
[00:51:41] The second you wait till Monday,
[00:51:43] they've gone in seven other open houses.
[00:51:46] Every other agent's calling them on Monday.
[00:51:48] You guys need to stop watching
[00:51:49] what all these other agents are doing and copying them,
[00:51:51] because the fact that 70% of agents
[00:51:52] didn't do a deal last year,
[00:51:54] and you're following what all those other agents are doing,
[00:51:56] eh, it's just, or one deal,
[00:51:58] I mean, it's just like that's a hard one,
[00:51:59] where nobody's calling them day up.
[00:52:02] Do what nobody else is doing.
[00:52:04] Call them day up, get them on a property alert,
[00:52:06] send them the video, hey, it was so nice to meet you.
[00:52:09] I'm so grateful for having you in my world now.
[00:52:12] What can I do to assist you in buying a home?
[00:52:14] Something like it doesn't matter,
[00:52:16] just be impressive and be there.
[00:52:18] Don't wait till Monday, like everybody else.
[00:52:20] It's just average, you know, they sense it.
[00:52:23] How are you taking notes along the way
[00:52:26] to make sure you remember anything of note
[00:52:29] because you have to be taking notes.
[00:52:31] So how are you doing that?
[00:52:33] Are you using a digital system?
[00:52:34] Are you using pen and paper?
[00:52:35] We're big on tech.
[00:52:37] I'm very luckily of my business partner Brett,
[00:52:39] a computer major, and so we get to use his tech brain,
[00:52:42] you know, for everything,
[00:52:42] but we use a system called lofty as our CRM,
[00:52:44] if you ever heard a lofty, okay?
[00:52:46] 
[00:52:46] We've been with them, sure, probably when they were chime,
[00:52:49] you know, originally for about,
[00:52:50] honestly, it's probably been over five years now, actually,
[00:52:53] that we've been with them, it's been a long time.
[00:52:55] But so we use the virtual sign-in sheet
[00:52:57] and one of my favorite parts of it
[00:52:59] is that right after the lead submits,
[00:53:02] it leaves this little window right there for the agent
[00:53:05] to go and put in a few notes really quick and then submit,
[00:53:09] and it goes in with the lead.
[00:53:11] Outside of that, they have a pen and paper.
[00:53:14] I'm big on letting people see that I'm taking notes.
[00:53:17] I think agents try to like hide, like, oh my God,
[00:53:20] I don't want them to see my pen and paper
[00:53:21] that I have here in my note.
[00:53:22] You guys, it's like good.
[00:53:24] When the waiter doesn't wipe down my order
[00:53:26] in front of my face, I'm like,
[00:53:27] yeah, you freak out a little bit.
[00:53:28] You're like, you get that?
[00:53:30] I'm like, you got me back, right?
[00:53:30] This dude just screwed up my whole night.
[00:53:32] My dinner is gonna come out wrong.
[00:53:33] And that's like right on my brain is that
[00:53:35] where if somebody's in front of me,
[00:53:36] just writing, okay, they're looking for a three-bedroom,
[00:53:38] two bath, okay, yeah, get it up.
[00:53:40] It's impressive.
[00:53:40] It just means you're like,
[00:53:41] are actually listening to what's going on.
[00:53:43] So if it's after they come to the kitchen counter,
[00:53:46] they're typically doing it on like a note pad,
[00:53:48] you know, so they can witness you taking notes.
[00:53:50] Sure.
[00:53:52] Okay, got it.
[00:53:53] So you're doing the three touches,
[00:53:55] we don't have to go through every touch,
[00:53:56] but basically you're continuing a psych a version
[00:53:59] of that cycle for the next, what, do you say seven days?
[00:54:02] So there's 21 touches for seven days of the goal
[00:54:04] after that.
[00:54:05] It will typically bounce back to like a few times a week,
[00:54:09] you know, like two or three times a week.
[00:54:11] We have an ISA team that calls our open house leads,
[00:54:13] you know, as well, just to make it easy.
[00:54:15] So the agents getting their touches,
[00:54:18] then the ISA is coming in and getting the touches typically,
[00:54:20] within about 90 days, we can call a week bump,
[00:54:23] you know, or not bump.
[00:54:24] And it's not that we throw them away.
[00:54:25] We just move them kind of out of our face
[00:54:27] and let some AI emails and stuff work on them.
[00:54:30] Like we want to get the hot ready to go.
[00:54:32] That's why we do our agents all do four open houses a month.
[00:54:35] Okay, it's just our standard that we hold, you know,
[00:54:37] four open houses because we know out of four open houses,
[00:54:41] we're going to get at least one escrow.
[00:54:42] Like it's just, I use CISU,
[00:54:44] then anybody's here heard a CISU,
[00:54:45] shout out Brian and spring.
[00:54:47] Oh my gosh, CISU is freaking amazing.
[00:54:49] So there's no guessing here.
[00:54:50] Like I know four open houses gets us at least one escrow.
[00:54:53] You know, it's, it's really unbelievable.
[00:54:58] We're talking about just running a system
[00:55:01] that we know other agents are not willing to do.
[00:55:05] The other agents, you really don't have any competition
[00:55:08] when it comes to other open houses.
[00:55:10] Nobody's seen anything like this before.
[00:55:12] The experience for the customer walking in
[00:55:15] is a positive experience.
[00:55:17] You're giving them value, you're leaving them alone,
[00:55:21] you're doing all the things they want you to do
[00:55:23] and you're still getting the information you want
[00:55:24] and now they're in your database.
[00:55:26] And Zach knows something very, very important,
[00:55:30] this important statistic and he might even have
[00:55:33] a different number than I have,
[00:55:34] but I ask chat GPT, this is what chat GPT says.
[00:55:38] And Zach now has these people in his database
[00:55:39] and he knows that at least 10 to 15% of every one
[00:55:43] of those people in his database
[00:55:44] is going to use a real estate agent in the next 12 months.
[00:55:47] That's just what the numbers say.
[00:55:48] So the more people he's got in that database,
[00:55:51] not just the people he has in the database.
[00:55:53] The people he has in there, the number of them
[00:55:55] and the number of times he's branding himself
[00:55:58] and reminding those people, I'm a professional,
[00:56:00] this is what I do, I'm here to help.
[00:56:02] Buh, buh, buh, buh.
[00:56:02] He is going to win the majority of those deals.
[00:56:06] So you are just expanding your database every single week.
[00:56:09] Yeah, they have a CRM right now that has 1.5 million people
[00:56:13] inside of it.
[00:56:14] I see agents show me databases that they like to do.
[00:56:17] My CRM is so busy, I can barely keep up with my tasks.
[00:56:21] Oh my gosh, they open it, it's like 50 people inside.
[00:56:24] I'm like, man, we got 1.5 million people inside of here.
[00:56:27] Like we're rolling.
[00:56:29] We're like, I'm all about the mass.
[00:56:31] Bring me the homeowners, bring me the buyers,
[00:56:33] bring me expi- like bring me everybody here
[00:56:35] and put them in my bubble.
[00:56:36] You know, because I just want to look impressive.
[00:56:38] All right.
[00:56:40] Well, you are impressive to me as somebody
[00:56:43] who interviews top agents all over the country.
[00:56:45] You absolutely without exception have the best open house strategy
[00:56:50] I've ever heard of.
[00:56:51] It's an absolute no-brainer.
[00:56:53] Does it require more work?
[00:56:54] Sure it does.
[00:56:55] So does everything in life that's worthwhile.
[00:56:56] It requires a little bit more work.
[00:56:59] But it's worth it.
[00:57:00] It's worth it.
[00:57:01] Yeah, it's worth it.
[00:57:02] It's not, there's no worrying because you've set up yourself
[00:57:07] to win and you're willing to put in the work too.
[00:57:09] That, okay, so let's, I think, you know,
[00:57:12] I want to have you back on the show
[00:57:13] because there's so many other aspects of this business
[00:57:15] that I know you have great systems for.
[00:57:18] So I want to talk to you about coming on more regularly.
[00:57:20] But before we end the show, I want everybody to,
[00:57:23] like obviously Zach has lots of good information to share.
[00:57:26] So I want to, let's talk about FamCamp.
[00:57:28] Your company is fam.
[00:57:29] Let's talk about what you do for agents
[00:57:31] because you turn agents into closers in just two weeks.
[00:57:35] So FamCamp is my baby.
[00:57:37] Okay, we've built FamCamp over the last five years
[00:57:39] and I can very 100% confidently say
[00:57:43] that FamCamp is the absolute best way
[00:57:46] for an agent to get in production.
[00:57:48] And I say that just based off track records.
[00:57:50] You guys can, I'm all about numbers.
[00:57:51] Okay, I'm not about guesswork here.
[00:57:52] So what FamCamp is is a two week boot camp.
[00:57:55] Okay, it's from 7 a.m. to 8 a.m.
[00:57:58] Okay, we do it for two weeks.
[00:57:59] Week one is all about systems and tech.
[00:58:03] Okay, so we don't train on sales and tech
[00:58:05] and manage all this at one time.
[00:58:07] It's just too much.
[00:58:08] So week one is the CRM fellow,
[00:58:11] how do you use our Google business, how do you slack,
[00:58:14] how do you use your tech stack,
[00:58:15] how do you use all these tools that are in your tool belt.
[00:58:17] Week two, we then move on to sales.
[00:58:20] You know, we're moving on to prospecting.
[00:58:21] So that's you're doing your first open houses,
[00:58:23] you're calling the neighbors around it,
[00:58:25] you're getting some older leads,
[00:58:26] we're calling your SOI.
[00:58:28] Okay, so our last FamCamp was five, was seven people.
[00:58:32] Okay, they went through the last one,
[00:58:34] that was about 60, or sorry, a little bit for 90 days ago.
[00:58:37] Two of them did not make it through, they tapped out.
[00:58:40] Okay, through which is why we have it.
[00:58:41] It's not, our model is not for everybody, well aware,
[00:58:44] you know, we're not perfect for everybody,
[00:58:46] but we're exceptional for some, okay.
[00:58:49] And during that two week process,
[00:58:52] and then 90 days following, that's always our goals.
[00:58:56] What does the next 90 days of somebody's career look like?
[00:58:59] Every single five of those agents have closed transactions.
[00:59:05] Okay, one of them has two sign listings right now,
[00:59:09] a closed buyer and another buyer signed on an agreement.
[00:59:12] The other one has four BBRAs signed, four buyer agreements.
[00:59:15] Like, you guys, it's just,
[00:59:16] it's not a complicated system, it's just hard work.
[00:59:19] You know, so it's an intense two weeks,
[00:59:22] but oh my God, is it worth it?
[00:59:24] You know, for what you pop out on the other side,
[00:59:27] and our goal is that FamCamp mixed with a 30, 60, 90, okay.
[00:59:32] The following days after is that you're in production,
[00:59:35] not that you have a signed agreement,
[00:59:37] not that you have a little bit of a pipeline
[00:59:39] that you have a closed transaction.
[00:59:42] That's being in production, is getting a paycheck.
[00:59:44] So that's our goal of the FamCamp, the 30, 60, 90,
[00:59:47] our current group of campers are just finishing up week one.
[00:59:52] This week, they've achieved two appointments.
[00:59:56] They've achieved 20, or sorry, 39 Google reviews.
[01:00:02] Like, what agents even have reviews right now,
[01:00:05] and our FamCampers don't even have experience.
[01:00:07] They have 39 reviews in the matter of seven days,
[01:00:10] and they've added about 185 SOI into the database.
[01:00:16] So like, once again, it's a simple, replicative process
[01:00:22] that I can be 100% confident in working
[01:00:25] as long as you're right for the environment,
[01:00:28] you know that you're being started.
[01:00:29] So if you just want to work a bunch of leads,
[01:00:30] no, FamCamp doesn't typically work for you.
[01:00:33] Real estate doesn't typically work, sorry.
[01:00:35] You know for you, but if you want to come in
[01:00:38] and you want to grow a pipeline, master your craft,
[01:00:41] is there really key word here?
[01:00:43] And get your first signed agreements in the process,
[01:00:46] your first closing, that's really what FamCamp,
[01:00:49] the 30, 69, you has designed around.
[01:00:52] And if someone is interested in doing,
[01:00:55] and again, this is what you just have one hour a day
[01:00:57] for the next two weeks.
[01:00:59] It's two weeks for one hour a day, it's not a big commitment.
[01:01:01] And this is why I think it's funny.
[01:01:02] We get people that tap out halfway through
[01:01:04] because of time and I go perfect.
[01:01:06] I go, if you can't get one hour a day for two weeks,
[01:01:09] I'm sorry, real estate is going to be a really hard road,
[01:01:13] you know for you to come.
[01:01:14] And I like that you started early in the morning too
[01:01:17] because that also has a demonstration of commitment.
[01:01:20] It's, look, you're probably not really starting your day
[01:01:22] at 7 a.m. most people in the country.
[01:01:25] So if you're willing to put in a little bit extra work
[01:01:27] so that you can be present and do some actual work
[01:01:29] from 7 to 8, you're probably at least on the right track
[01:01:33] because you're right.
[01:01:34] You're going to have to get up,
[01:01:35] you're going to have to work long hours in this business.
[01:01:37] I'll end it with one story, you guys.
[01:01:38] I always like to say what is the possible
[01:01:40] instead of what is going to happen
[01:01:42] because everybody's different.
[01:01:44] Okay, but the possible is we had an agent
[01:01:46] who joined our team last year.
[01:01:48] She did real estate for about six months of last year,
[01:01:51] first year in real estate, okay?
[01:01:53] She did $10 million.
[01:01:55] Okay, in six months of real estate.
[01:01:57] Currently for this year already,
[01:02:00] she's on track to do $22 million at 22 years old.
[01:02:05] And, you know, we think boy, who's giving, you know,
[01:02:09] who's listing or using a buyer or who's a buyer or a seller,
[01:02:13] who's using a 22 year old, right?
[01:02:15] We're like, that doesn't happen.
[01:02:16] Well, she's also doing it in the second most competitive market
[01:02:19] that exists in the United States.
[01:02:22] And she's signing, she has four escros right now
[01:02:26] and five listing signed for 2025.
[01:02:30] The work works.
[01:02:32] I promise you, just stop avoiding the work.
[01:02:35] That's the number one thing.
[01:02:36] Agents avoid the work too early.
[01:02:37] The work works.
[01:02:38] I absolutely promise you.
[01:02:41] Zach, send real estate is where you go to learn
[01:02:44] about all things Zach and his team,
[01:02:47] fam, for fam, realty group, they are in SoCal,
[01:02:51] but they work with agents all over the country.
[01:02:54] So please, even if you're in Delaware,
[01:02:56] you're somewhere else and you're like,
[01:02:57] I need to learn from somebody like Zach
[01:02:59] or from Zach directly.
[01:03:01] You're gonna want to reach out to him,
[01:03:02] Zach's in real estate on Instagram.
[01:03:04] Zach, is there another way that people should check out?
[01:03:05] Yeah, if you want you can go to my YouTube, you know, as well.
[01:03:08] You guys, I'm in a book, you know,
[01:03:10] I don't hide anything.
[01:03:11] A lot of our like recorded team trainings are on YouTube.
[01:03:15] Like I'm just posting our actual trainings.
[01:03:17] I'm not doing like a top five things that close and expired.
[01:03:19] Like it's our actual live team trainings that we're doing.
[01:03:22] So my YouTube is just Zach, guys in Dwarfer.
[01:03:25] Okay, Zach, ZAC, H, guys in Dwarfer, GEI, SEM,
[01:03:30] and you'll see it pop up right away.
[01:03:31] There's not many Zach guys in Dwarfers.
[01:03:33] Okay, on there, but GEI, SEM, DOR, FER.
[01:03:37] Okay, those are literally recorded trainings from our team.
[01:03:41] If you want to go on my Instagram
[01:03:42] and click a link to book with me,
[01:03:43] you'll literally get an hour of my time on a strategy session for free.
[01:03:47] You guys absolutely for free.
[01:03:49] So if you want to sit down and just say a little bit of a business audit
[01:03:52] or a scripting session, whatever it is that you think your business is,
[01:03:56] like let's just do it.
[01:03:58] Why not?
[01:03:58] Like why not let's just show up?
[01:04:01] You know what I didn't hear you say today was, you know,
[01:04:04] it's really a bummer because rates are so high,
[01:04:07] inventory is so low, and those are true.
[01:04:10] Yeah, those are true.
[01:04:11] Those are affecting people.
[01:04:13] I didn't hear you talk about that.
[01:04:14] And wonder why?
[01:04:15] Because you don't, it doesn't matter to you.
[01:04:17] You're running your chopping wood and carrying water,
[01:04:19] no matter what the market conditions are.
[01:04:21] And you know that all you have to do is maybe adjust your strategy here
[01:04:25] and there according to market conditions,
[01:04:26] but it's literally, like you said, trust the process, trust the work.
[01:04:31] The work works.
[01:04:32] Yeah, so I think that's just in life.
[01:04:36] Don't just not just in real estate and life.
[01:04:38] Like don't focus on the things you can't control.
[01:04:40] Like rates and the market, you know,
[01:04:42] all these things, sure, I like to know the theme of the market
[01:04:45] is what I like to call it.
[01:04:46] It is my theme buyers right now.
[01:04:48] Is it sellers?
[01:04:49] Is it like what is my theme at the moment?
[01:04:51] But you guys, you spend so much time.
[01:04:53] I talked to agent like my last year was so hard.
[01:04:55] Just the rates were high or because you know, because of this.
[01:04:58] Because I'm like, why are you putting your business in control
[01:05:00] of something that you can't control?
[01:05:02] Like that just doesn't make a ton of sense to me.
[01:05:05] And I want to ask one final question
[01:05:07] because nobody is perfect and everyone's business has imperfections.
[01:05:11] And this will just humanize that a little bit and let us know
[01:05:14] that he has challenges because we always, always have challenges.
[01:05:18] What is a current challenge in your business?
[01:05:21] And we're, you know, what are you thinking?
[01:05:23] How are you thinking?
[01:05:23] Totally.
[01:05:24] So a big one for us is in social media.
[01:05:26] Okay, we were very behind the ring on social media.
[01:05:28] It's funny.
[01:05:28] Most people do social media to get production.
[01:05:31] We actually were doing production to show off on social media.
[01:05:34] We kind of had the wrong concept.
[01:05:35] So really building our social media was a big tool that we lacked
[01:05:40] for many, many years, actually, for about four years of our team.
[01:05:44] We did a little bit.
[01:05:45] We posted.
[01:05:45] We hired some companies, but nothing was really a brand, you know,
[01:05:50] that we were able to create.
[01:05:51] So it's funny.
[01:05:51] We're kind of doing it the opposite as most teams.
[01:05:53] But so our big goal for this year is to really brand really heavy,
[01:05:57] create more online presence, more social media presence,
[01:06:01] YouTube, Instagram.
[01:06:02] We were way behind, you know, on that.
[01:06:04] So we just hired an in-house media team, about 15 employees
[01:06:09] that now from the editing, they tell us,
[01:06:12] Hey, Zach, you need to get us a video.
[01:06:14] They go, you haven't sent us a video.
[01:06:16] I'm like, two days.
[01:06:16] I'm like, cool, got it.
[01:06:17] My bad.
[01:06:18] Like, you know, I just don't think about it.
[01:06:20] So social was a big one for us that we really wished we were
[01:06:24] stronger in over the last few years.
[01:06:25] And our goal for 2025 is that we have a really strong social
[01:06:29] presence, you know, at the end of the year.
[01:06:32] And I love that you've built this entire process in team
[01:06:36] with essentially very little to know social media presence
[01:06:40] in your young guy.
[01:06:41] It's not like you're a six-year-old guy.
[01:06:42] He's like, well, I just got a huge network of friends.
[01:06:44] I wish I was a social media guy.
[01:06:45] You're like, no, no, everybody I know is on social all day long.
[01:06:48] And I didn't really do that.
[01:06:50] And look where I'm at.
[01:06:51] And I did 100 homes.
[01:06:52] And I'm on PROSP past to do 222 this year.
[01:06:55] Oh, and yeah, I need to actually get my social media up and running.
[01:06:58] And I'm working on that.
[01:06:58] But that is awesome.
[01:07:00] So I appreciate you being vulnerable and sharing,
[01:07:03] hey, my business ain't isn't perfect.
[01:07:04] Either nobody's business is.
[01:07:06] But you've got some really strong process.
[01:07:08] And guys, if this was a value, I mean, I know it was,
[01:07:11] let me know that it was a value to you.
[01:07:13] Let shoot, shoot me a message.
[01:07:15] This helps me know what you like.
[01:07:17] I know you like Zach.
[01:07:18] You want to hear more of Zach?
[01:07:19] I'd like to hear more of Zach.
[01:07:20] So, you know, if Zach was like a really good, I mean, gosh,
[01:07:23] this truly is one of the best episodes I think we've ever done.
[01:07:27] Not because of me, but because of Zach.
[01:07:29] So if this was super valuable to you, do, do, do be two favors.
[01:07:33] One, shoot me a message on social or, you know,
[01:07:36] whatever, you can find me.
[01:07:36] I'm easy.
[01:07:38] Find me.
[01:07:38] Let me know if you appreciated this and also let Zach know.
[01:07:40] That would really even be better.
[01:07:41] Let him know how much you appreciate.
[01:07:43] But also tell another agent about this episode.
[01:07:46] Shoot them a link every agent in the country should really hear this.
[01:07:49] He just gave all of you his entire strategy for free.
[01:07:52] Didn't ask for anything from you.
[01:07:53] He's a good guy.
[01:07:55] That's pretty awesome.
[01:07:56] And thank you, Zach, on behalf of everyone listening.
[01:07:58] So please tell a friend everyone listening about this episode.
[01:08:01] Just pass through to your office.
[01:08:03] You will be a hero to them and you will help their production.
[01:08:06] And that will help your own production as well.
[01:08:08] Let's all help each other.
[01:08:09] And the other thing is leave us a review.
[01:08:11] Let us know what you think of the show.

Now, as a real estate recruiter, I can tell you the answer is always yes. But most agents aren't looking to move right now. So how do you know who to contact? Well, what if I were to tell you there's a recruiting and retention tool powered by artificial intelligence that shows you exactly which agents in your local market are looking to leave their brokerage right now and which agents at your own firm are also looking to leave you. Now, I've been recruiting REALTORS for 15 years and I've hired over 2000 agents. I can tell you with no exaggeration, this is the tool I've been waiting for. Corded's AI looks for trends across dozens of variables for each agent in your market and shows you which agents they believe are likely to move. Not only does it do that, but corded's AI went and visited my recruiting website and read everything I offer. So now when I'm recruiting, corded's AI tells me exactly what to say based on that agent's needs and what my brokerage can offer. It even writes emails for me. I've never seen anything like it and I use it every single day. Now, if you are looking to grow your brokerage, corded.io is the best tool out there. Visit corded.io to schedule a demo again.

Right now it helps us out a ton. All right, guys, let's get on to my conversation with Zach Geisendorfer. What is the best piece of advice that you've ever received as an agent? I think the best piece of advice I've gone is also the simplest piece of advice, which I seem to find very often, you know, tends to be. So personally, my favorite one is the work works super simple. I got told super early in the sales, not even just real estate. Hey, like the work works in sales as long as you work the work. And I was like, oh my God, what are you even talking about the work? What is work in the work? And yeah, I'm just here to close deals. And as you kind of get going in any sales career whether it's real estate or something else, you realize, oh, the work. Yeah, it works. Okay. Trust, trust the process. Trust the process and also trust the basics. The basics are the basics for a reason. Like the normal work every day work that an agent does, it works most likely. You're just trying to bump out of that work. You know, trying to do something that's outside the wheel. One of my favorite expressions is before enlightenment, chop wood, carry water, after enlightenment, chop wood, carry water. It's like, you just got to do keep doing the basic. Okay. And what is a not great piece of advice? What's maybe the worst piece of advice you've ever heard as an agent? One of the first pieces of advice I got when I first came into real estate and we started growing our team was work with every single person. They were just like, cry to help every single person that's out there, get the masses, doesn't matter. Like, what's an avatar client? You know, all this stuff and it was just go, go, go, go, go. And it just didn't really work out too well for us personally. You know, it just, it was all these non-affered our clients, people that were hard, people that were out of our area. And we'd be like, talking with our coach and he was like, oh, it's only an hour and a half drive. That's totally fine. It's like three hours if your day is gone. And so I just learned very quickly. It wasn't a sustainable, replicable way to do it, which is why I think it's one of the worst pieces of advice I got because you're losing your number one asset, which is your time, you know, doing something like that. Perfectly said. Well, today our guest is Zach Geisendorf for with eXp in in in California and so Cal. Zach is a so Cal guy. He's actually been there his whole life grew up in Orange County and works predominantly in the San Diego area as well as Orange County. So let me tell you more about Zach. So Zach grew up in so Cal, like we mentioned, he's lived there his entire life, which again, super jealous of that. He's been in sales since high school where he got his start working the floor at Sports Shilé and he's been hooked on helping people ever since. And today he still lives in So Cal with the love of his life Rachel and a 28 years old. This is insane. He is the sales manager and partner at Fam Realty Group. He's a top performing mega team with eXp Realty having closed over 100 homes last year again in the in the 30 sorry the worst year for home sales in the past 30 years. He closed 100 homes and get this this year. He's on pace to do 222 homes. Incredible. His mission is simple to be the number one vehicle in the I love it is missions and simple, but but but very ambitious, which is the to be the number one vehicle in the United States for real estate agents to hit their financial goals. He's obsessed with building systems culture and sales skills that create real sustainable success for agents at every level and he is building his team. So our listeners, if you like what Zach is going to say and you probably will based on the amount of production that he and his team are doing, he's a good guy. I like him a lot and you should really consider talking to him and seeing if you'd be a fit. You know, Zach actually works with agents all over the country. So it doesn't just have to be local. So Cal folks, although if you are local, you should reach out to him as well. Follow him on Instagram. He is at Zach Zen, which Z.E.N. So ZAC, Z.E.N real estate will have a link to that in the show notes against Zach Zen, on Instagram, Zach. Welcome to the show. I appreciate it so much. I really appreciate you guys having me. Yeah, super excited. You are really a lot of fun to we would chat in a little bit before and and we seem to have a lot a lot of fun things to talk about. So first of all, I want to know how you got started in real estate. So what brought you to real estate? What were you doing before? I know you're mentioning you were at Sportschela, but how did you get from there to real estate? Definitely. So I realized very quickly that's your Sportschela that sales is where I was meant to be. I picked a pair of goggles weirdly enough. I ran the water section and I'd pick one pair of goggles, make that my product until they were sold out and I'd move to the next pair and the next pair and the next pair. And we like blue numbers off the roof and I was like, what am I doing at Sportschela? I was like, this is crazy. So I went through a bunch of different sales jobs, kind of, you know, work in my way up and I landed selling real estate leads for a company called Set Schedule. I'm sorry. I know those guys very well. They're right. They're so calm as well. They are so calm as well and not to put them down any way. Just over my year of being there, my first 30 days I broke a company record. So I knew phone sales communication is where I was supposed to be. After 90 days, I was in the top two sales reps consecutively for three months. And after a year of being there, I sold about a million dollars worth of leads. You know, that's where I met my business partner now, Francis, who I actually followed up with her for about five months trying to sell her leads. You know, in this company that we were a part of or that I was a part of. And she stopped me one day and just said, hey, what are you doing? Like selling leads. She was like, I'm not going to I'm not going to buy these from you, which is kind of stung. But she was like, if you ever need a job, like let me know. And it was kind of one of those like, sure, call me, you know, type of offers. I ended up quitting my job on the spot. It just kind of felt right. I have no idea why, but I quit it on the spot called her and said, hey, like, you need to hire me now. And so that's where I started in real estate as an ISA for anybody who doesn't know what an ISA is, essentially a cold collar. That's a rough, a rough starting job for you. But you know what, it's trial by fire. So ISA is somebody that is going to be taking inbound calls for leads, going to be making lots of outbound calls for leads. Basically, is sitting on the phone all day, trying to get people to answer or answer questions, setting up appointments. It is boy, not for the faint of heart for sure, but a really good way to learn how to talk about real estate because you're doing that all day long. Yep, 100% and I came in from knowing nothing about real estate to calling a homeowner and saying, hey, do you want to sell your house? You know what that's. And I learned very quickly what didn't work and took me a little bit longer to find what does work on that one. So my first year with her, I did about 100,000 outbound calls as an ISA. That was my goal was to hit 100,000 because in my mind, if I could do 100,000 calls, I would be an expert at cold calling homeowners. I learned quickly, it changes every year. So you sure you can be an expert, but every single year, you need to update your craft, you need to grow, you need to continue. So I kept on doing 100,000 calls every single year for the last five years, which ending I try to keep track of my wife or I should be pushing almost 600,000 calls over the last five years. Unbelievable. That is, you know, I have so much, you know, we talk about chop wood, carry water. That is chopping the wood and carrying the water. And certainly not the easiest thing to do. I want to give a quick shout out because Zach mentioned something, the art of calls and whether it's a cold call or follow-up calls. We all have, well, most of us have, suffer's act, has a little bit of call reluctance, right? So this is something that we just kind of, we don't really want to call. People aren't calling as much these days. And the follow-ups are in the wind, Zach can tell you that working. Zach's worked at a lead company. He knows it's not usually even the first call that gets it done. It might be the sixth or seventh or, you know, anything in between or after. But I'm going to give a quick plug. I wish I was getting paid by these guys. This is one of the, and as Zach, I don't know if you know these guys. If not, check them out. There's a great group where you can sign. If you're having call reluctance and these guys will get you to, they'll tell you exactly what to say on the call. They're not just real estate. They do all sorts of industries, but called 30 minutes to presidents club, which is 30mpc.com. These guys are the real deal. They have all the data on what works. Anyway, so enough about that. But 30mpc.com, check them out. I found it to be super cool. And we all should be making more calls. So great. So you were at set schedule. You were making a lot of calls there. I know that company. I know that company. 400 hand dials a day. Like on an old office phone, we didn't have dialers, you know, like at that point. Like I would hold the office phone like this and I would take my pencil. And I'd do about 400 dials going through Realtor.com. I would just go through Realtor.com, start at the top, go down. And my goal was out of 400 dials. If I could get like 15 appointments for the next day, then we're in a good spot. You know, and that was my goal is about, if I do 15 presentations booked, I knew my math. I knew I'd have about six that would show up for that day. And if I can pitch six people, I'll close to. So it was just simple math. I knew what my math was. Wow. Well, I will tell you, it takes a lot of discipline and just fortitude to power through hundreds of dials a day. I started that when I, in my first job as financial advisor, well, not my first job, but my first job as a financial advisor. I was making about 200 dials a day and I thought that was insane. And we did not have a dialer either. But boy, you really develop, you develop, yeah, thanks. You really develop a lot of resiliency. And you started, it's almost like, you know, for guys who are afraid, who are single, who are afraid to approach a woman and ask for a date, like all you have to do is ask about, you know, 20 different women who you find interesting to like chat with, you'll realize like, oh, you'll get rejected. It's okay. It's not the end of the world. You're still standing. And you know, some of them are married, have boyfriends or just aren't interested in you. Like, who cares? But it feels like it's the end of the world. It feels, you know, awful to think, you know, it's what's that anticipation in our mind of like, this is going to hurt. The reality of it is, it doesn't have to. And you know, if you're confident in your own, I'm a good person, I'm a good human being, then, you know, making those dials and having somebody go, you're the fifth REALTOR to call me today because I have my home FSBO. You know, oh, I'm sorry, it didn't mean to bug you. I'll keep going, you know, not the end of the world, but I know you've probably had your fair share of abuse on the phones. And you just kind of shaken off. It's not about you. You know, I mean, you get in yelled at, said funny things to text messages like yada, yada, yada, yada. Let me just be super direct with you. Anybody on here who's listening about cold calling, it's pretty rare. Okay, that you get somebody super rude. Okay, on the other hand, nine, and I'm here in California. Okay, like trust me, I get rude people. Okay, on the phones, like, and it's very rare that someone actually is rude, aggressive, or mean to me on the phone. Normally, I just like, hey man, no, I'm not interested. Thanks. And you're on the next, you know, it's not like this big scary thing. So I coach, when I coach people on cold calling and on prospecting in general, I'm a very strong believer that you need to teach it like you would teach a swim class. In the first day of swim class, they put you in the water to show that you're not going to drowned. So then the next day you come in, you're like, oh my god, it's okay, I'm not going to drown. Okay, I'll get in the water and everything's okay after that. So a lot of people try to learn cold calling off of YouTube, off of videos, but then they never take the actual step to try to just make the call and see what, you know, and see what happens. It's just like, swim class guys, you've got to jump in, watch the YouTube videos. Don't get me wrong. Like, master your craft, but you need to have some implementation calling to know like, oh my god, this person can't kill me on the other side of the phone. You know, like, I'm okay here. Like, I'm just going to call the next person. You know, and everything's fine. Plus, too, like, I think, you know, look, we'd love to say that everything is relationships. And maybe there are lots of agents that can do that where it's literally their networking gurus and they are just, you know, connecting all over the place. And if you're that person, god bless you for the rest of us, and especially for the introverts out there, like, this is perfect for introverts, right? So I believe it or not, I'm an introvert. And I like making, I don't like making dials. I don't think anyone likes making dials. But I like that I don't have to go outside to make dials. And I know that I can just go person to person to person. But I want to switch gears because you are a big believer in open houses. And I love this because I hear it all the time from agents who, I've never really heard it from a successful agent, but I've heard it from agents who are maybe newer in the industry or maybe they're just not having success they want. They're like, yeah, open houses that just doesn't work. And I know that they do because I talk to agents like you every day or every other day that on the show that literally prove otherwise. But tell me about open houses. I know that you are like, no, open houses literally print money for you if you do them right. So tell us. Yeah, so I'll just be really simple. You guys, the reason open houses don't work is because you're not hosting open houses. You're just hanging out in the house on a Saturday afternoon. Okay, there's very, very, very big difference. Okay. And those two items. Last year for 2024, like you said, one of the hardest years for real estate, we paid out over $350,000 worth of GCI just from open house seats. Okay, so when I say we know open houses work, it's because I know for a fact that they work. I'm not here guessing. Okay, with you guys, I don't leave paychecks up to guess work. Okay, it's just nobody, nobody should want to do that. So very simply our open house, we call them mega open house. Okay, and it's because it is a mega open house. And it also implements in your brain that you're going to have a mega open house this week. And I'm not going to go just hang out on the couch. Okay, for two, three hours. Our open houses start on Wednesday. Okay, so if I have an open house on Saturday, my job starts Wednesday. Not Saturday morning, one hour before the open house. Okay, when I show up. So just to kind of walk through some very basic steps and we can deep dive. Of course, if you want it, we have Wednesday starts to dial in around the open house. So on average, we want to call two to 300 homeowners around that open house before the actual open house. And if you're on here and you're listening, you're like, oh my God, that's so many dials with so many of this. I have brand new agents on our team that closed their first escrow in 30 days from dialing around an open house. Our main price point is 865. Okay, so like they're doing just fine. And I promise you, it works. So just to slow it down a bit. So we get an open house, we have a listing, we have an open house. Or maybe it's not even our listing. Maybe it's somebody else's listing in our office. And they're saying, hey, you can do an open house, even better, even better. So what Zach is doing is he's getting the phone numbers for all the people that are in those immediate surrounding areas because, well, he's going to tell us why. But I'm going to tell you my idea. Why? Because everybody's nosy and wants to see what's inside their neighbor's home. But also maybe, you know, obviously facilitate the idea. Hmm, maybe I should sell mine. But go ahead, tell us why that works. All production is derived from one thing and it's conversations. And so if I have a reason to call somebody instead of just a cold call, I'm going to take that reason. And so these calls are much easier than like calling a list of expires. Okay, or something like that because I have a reason to call like I really do. And so we run the Pick Your Neighbor campaign. That's what we like to call it, aka the even nosy neighbor, pick your next person, you know, et cetera. But I'm just a drop the bomb. I'll drop the script. It's okay on here right now. It's very simple. It's, hey, DJ, hey, DJ, this is Zach. I'm actually selling your neighbor's house right over the street on two, three, three, four, Jupiter. I was calling to let you know they're going to have a huge mega open house this weekend. Saturday and Sunday, one to four. There's going to be a lot more traffic than normal in the neighborhood. I just wanted to see by chance, do you know of anybody that wants to come see the house or move into the neighborhood? So we're on the Pick Your Neighbor campaign and they go, wait, what house are they going, no, man, like I'm good, I'm not selling. I go, no, I'm actually not calling you about selling. I'm calling you about picking your next neighbor and they're like, okay, what? What is that? What does that mean? And so I just run them through it. You guys, most of these people are curious. You're just, you're trying to sell them on something. I'm just trying to create curiosity, you know, is my, is my first step, you know, that we're doing here. And so I, we run the Pick Your Neighbor campaign. A lot of them say, no, we don't have somebody. Okay, then wants to come see the house. And then I, I drew my backup, which is trying to get them into like a market report, you know, inside of our system. So I go, hey, DJ, totally understand that you may not have somebody who wants to come see the house. What I'd like to do is I'm already doing it for a few of your neighbors is I make this really high level and crafted report that I send out every single month. It shows homeowners exactly what's going on in the market, exactly what's going on in the community. And really, it just gives you all the information a homeowner should know about their home. Where should I send that text or email? No questions. It's not so whether or not they have somebody from my open house as a no, I'm then going to get them in my database for a future listing. Okay, and it's not rocket science that simple two minute call right there. We'll bring you 12 to 15 people into your database per week. Easy, easy. And those are sellers that know your name, know your voice, gave you a valid email. And we use fellow shout out to fellow. We use them for all of our market reports and Ryan Young is amazing. So we just put them into fellow. And then they're in fellow and we're good. We just follow up every like 90 days. You know, it's super simple. But so that way you get people that come to your open house. Okay, you get to look like a listing agent. Even if you're not so for new agents, if you're not calling around open houses saying I'm selling your neighbor's house, you're just missing your opportunity to brand as a listing agent. They don't know, you know, who has the listing and who doesn't. Also, even if they know who has it, who's the impressive listing agent? The one calling the homeowners or the one with their name on the side. It's the one calling the homeowners. And then the third one is it gives you sellers and your database for future, you know, transactions. I love the idea too of picking your neighbor because we all care who is across the street, right? You know, even if we're not going to be buddies with them, we want to at least feel like, oh, I like that person. If for whatever reason or we certainly don't want to feel like I don't like that person. And even though you're right, they're not really going to have somebody probably ready to buy that house. It at least gets them thinking about, hmm, who do I know? Who would be kind of fun to live a car? Like in a real subtle way, it's a fun exercise for them to go through in their mind. Just because they're like, okay, they're thinking all my buddies. Any of them are moving right now. You know, I mean, and again, the odds of them actually moving into that home are few and far between, but that's not why you're doing it. But there's something psychologically kind of satisfying about thinking about if I lived by my friends, how cool would that be? Like it feels good. One else of this we're most agents mess up on this is they call looking for listings. An impressive listing agent doesn't call a neighbor that they have a live listing in looking to create competition for themselves. That just doesn't make sense. I hear a lot of agents down to go, Zach, hey, I'm calling. No one's saying, hey, this is Greg and I was just wanting to listing your neighbor's house right here. It's for sale right now. Or have you ever any thoughts about selling your house for looking at offers? I'm like, bro, we're way too early for that. That's after closing. You know that we can do that. An impressive agent is focused on that deal. And so I'm always trying to sell that house. Once they say no, and they disqualify themselves from being a candidate for the house, now I can move into trying to be a listing agent and talk to them about their home. But that's where a lot of agents miss that step. People want to hire an impressive listing agent to sell their home. They're not trying to just call an agent that's calling around. You know, yeah, yeah. So don't call around for more listings in the neighborhood. Call just being the impressive listing agent trying to sell the home because that's your job in the first place. And they feel that on the phone. And that's why they remember you. And they don't remember the random guy that sold the home in the neighborhood like 30 days prior. Plus they're now thinking, wow, this guy's like really a go-getter. Like he's literally calling all of us in the name like no other agents want to do that. So I mean the reality but is it's not like there's a lot of other competition. You know, if there's another open house next door to your open house, odds are that person across street is getting one phone call yours. And they're probably like, hey, that kid's pretty good. You know, he's working hard and it's just it's very it's an impressive thing. I think and it's not invasive. You're not asking for anything. You're just saying, hey, I just want to let you know. That's why he's saying, hey, you know what? I should yeah, and I shoot out this thing that'll help you to kind of always let you know what your home is worth. What's going on in the neighborhood? Where do you want me to sign it like easy? Now you got the open house. You've called the neighbors on when I'm sorry. I don't want to maybe we skip this. No, no. So is there anything you're starting that on Wednesday? I've got a Wednesday having the open house. That's going to take Wednesday and Thursday and part usually part of Friday. Okay, it's a lot of people, you know, doing two, three hundred dials doesn't go super quick. Unless you have like a dialer, obviously you can do it a lot faster. Then we're also going to mega study the house itself. Okay, so when I say that house, not just the details like the square footage and the bedrooms and the baths, like I'm talking knowledge bomb something that they cannot find. So I'm talking like the house that sold down the street three months ago. I want to know all the areas that's what is the average for sale or what is the average of over this price that it sells or under this price. What is the average days on market in here? Did the last one fall out of escrow at any point? I'm going to call the agents before I host the last listing agents on the other listings that sold in there and literally say, hey, how did your last sale go? Like I am going to be D inside scoop. So when they walk in my open house, they are like, holy moly. They are just like, it's impossible not to get impressed. Walking in there because the average agent knows how it's a three bedroom, two bath, 1,500 square feet, and it's a single story home. We're like, thanks point Dexter for letting me know the house I just came to see. Like I'm sorry, but it's just, you know, I'm not going to be rude. The things I can already see for myself. The agents are becoming a commodity because of that. That's my big word here for agents on our team. We focus on not being a commodity, which means we have to have information. They can't just get from Zillow. You know, aka, the closed calms, the average over all these little things. I want that information. So when they come in, it just comes out in your language. You don't even need to try to use it. Your brain wants to show off. So you're literally calling the listing agents. Are you also calling the buy side agents for the deals that happen? Really depends. If it's like a really niche area or something like that, I would. But if it's like a standard cookie cutter, I'll call one or two listing agents, get some, you know, see how their last sales were. So when somebody comes in, I go, hey, you know, DJ, I know you said that this is maybe a perfect house for you guys. I just want to let you know the last house that sold down there had 17 offers closed escrow in 10 days. So this is a pretty aggressive neighborhood. And let me ask you, what do you think you want to offer on the home? And it creates that, oh my god, I'm working with the right person. You know, is what it does. Yeah. I love that. And so by the way, back to the cold call just for a second, I wanted to ask this. What if somebody says, what's a mega open house? What's the answer to that? So my personal response that I do this like, oh, my god, I'm so sorry that you haven't been able to witness in a mega open house before. So I give this like a apology like, oh, my god, so sorry you haven't been invited before. And they're like, what? And I go, a mega open house is when we're selling a home and we open the doors for business for the weekend and our number one goal is to create a traffic jam. So I go, I apologize, you know, and that's why I'm calling the neighborhood in advance is because my literal goal with selling your neighbor's house is you created traffic jam of people coming in. So I create the highest comp possible for the community, which obviously affects your home, And affects their home and makes the whole world go around. So I kind of just give that like, hey, so sorry you haven't heard of this before. Wow, like, let me tell you what this is. And I just, you know, I talk about the traffic jam because we've done that multiple times where we've literally caused traffic jams, you know, in neighborhoods. So I think it's a cool picture in people's heads. You know, it's like, wait, a traffic jam. They start picturing this open house with all these cars, like kind of colliding in and, you know, coming in and so that's usually my little mini explanation. So Zach just did something very skillful and it's a subtle thing that you might not have picked up on and I want to address this because if you identify the structure of what he's doing, you can apply this all throughout the sales marketing process or the sales cycle. Zach did something very, very clever. He identified a future problem for the guy across the street. And offered a solution or offered a reason why it's actually a benefit to that person. So he said, hey, I'm really sorry, you know, just so you know, there's, there's going to be a lot of traffic that day. You know, I apologize for that. And the reason I'm doing that is because I want as many offers as I can for that house because I want to drive up those comps so that you as well, the whole neighborhood will benefit from this. So he basically identified a potential issue where people go, I don't want to deal with a traffic jam for my neighbor's house. It cares. And then Zach goes, here's why you need to care. And here's why it's a minor inconvenience. And he basically just solved that entire, brought up a problem and addressed it and solved it and made it worth the person's time to go, oh, that's pretty cool. Okay, cool. So I love that. My favorite line here, everybody should remember this. The only thing you should be thinking that's in your prospect's head is what's in this for me. They could care less than himself on their neighbor's house and have an open house and all this. So like I said, it's just this big inconvenience until I make it about them. Okay, so it's really important. One of my favorite phrases is this benefits you because, because everyone will be like, oh, my God, I have this amazing open house and this. And then they'll hike up all this stuff. And then the homeowners just like, that sounds cool. And I go, the reason this benefits you is because, because it's all about you is because I'm going to boost the comps in the neighborhood. I'm going to break a neighborhood sale record. And I'm going to bring so much traffic in here that we're going to have so many offers that you may even want to look at one of those offers on your home. Like I'm just I'm hitting it hard. You know, like, hey, this is valuable for you to not just that homeowner, but it's that key phrase that it's valued to you because, you know, and you get that reason. This is why you should care about it, essentially, because they don't care unless you tell them why they should care. And everyone has that number that even though they don't want to move and they're not looking to list their home, everyone's got that number that if somebody threw that at them, they would move. Even they would give up that three percent mortgage if that number was high enough. And so it really gets the person thinking, Zack's driving up the comp, he's going to eat once a bidding war. Gosh, you know, maybe I should check out see what's going on here. See what this guy's all about because maybe somebody would want to throw me a number that's pretty insane. So brilliant all the way around. Oh my gosh. So much value. I'm in the open house yet. Okay, so now let's get to the open house. So now you're at the open house. People are coming in. Okay, so our one house has a few factors. One first off is signage. Okay, I ask a lot of agents. How many signs do you put out? And my I'd say the average answer here is between five and maybe like eight, you know, signs that people are putting out. So we have a minimum of 50. Okay, that we put out. So we hire a sign guy, like a new build guy who for our team list things, we go and have 50 signs put out. And that does not include the 15 signs that the agent's going to bring with their name, their phone number for inside of the neighborhood. So sometimes we'll have up to 65 signs for an open house. I know some of you guys are like rolling your eyes. Well, of course they're busy. You can put out 65 signs. You guys, before we had a sign guy, our agents were doing this. We're just all about raising the value of our agents times. You're like, I used to have an agent that would go to the signs at five in the morning. She would drive out, put out signs at like four or five a.m. when it's still dark out, no cars on the road, hammer everything. And then she'd be good, you know, it would take her like not that long. She's just being smart with her time. But so I know it sounds like a lot. But when an agent to the left of me has an open house that had three people through it, and then my agent to the right had 80. 80 people through and that's not something. Number last weekend literally on a Saturday, Sunday, sorry, not even a Saturday, Sunday, our agent resident had 80 people through his open house. I'm willing to put in the few extra hours to get 80 people through my open house. So signage is huge. Okay, I highly suggest get bright colors. We do like neon pink, neon blue, green, like the, our brand colors are black and gold. I wish we could do those everywhere, but they blend in. They do. They just, you know, people don't read any of the writing or anything. They just see a big arrow, you know, and they point in. So we're going from the freeway all the way to the house, typically. Like we want to get people down that whole windy road, you know, in and then inside the neighborhood, we have our agents put 15 of their branded signs, their face, their name, their phone number. Because if all they have to do is sign inside of a neighborhood with 15 signs, you'll do that no problem. You know, that's 30, that's 30 minutes right there, you know, just to put those out. And it's really dense. So basically, the cars are just following following arrows. I drove by a new build and said, why the heck are they allowed to have 100 signs out in 10 foot flags and all this stuff and we can't? And so I looked into and I was like, oh, we can. People just don't do it. And so we have said 217 foot tall flags that we put right in the front of the house. Okay, they're super easy and you don't want Amazon of like 60 bucks. You know, or something like that. We just, wham, stick them in. And people drive by and it looks like a freaking carnival. Dude, like it just like it is. Like it looks like they're like, okay, whatever, there's an open house. Oh my god, there's the same sign. Oh my god, there's three of the same sign. Oh my god, we're going into our neighborhood and there's five signs 10 feet apart all point in here. Like I have to go inside. Like I have to. So we're forcing plus how impressive. I'm sorry to interrupt it. Plus how impressive that looks to the neighbors. Right? Like we might be thinking, ooh, that's a little much, that's a little much. But and yes, maybe it is much to some people. But if you're selling your home, you want much. You want as many people coming by as possible. So what you're really doing is conditioning the neighbors to go, this is how much I care. And nobody else has done this before. They've seen other homes for sale. It's quiet. There's one home and there's a sign in the yard. And that's probably about it. They're not seeing this level of activity. And they're like, wow, this guy's really putting me down. You guys are average days on market right now. It's 14 days. And that's all of 2024 to this first quarter of 2025 average. And that's with a medium price point. Like set of right below $900,000. So like when I say we know how to sell homes, like we and we're all about quick, highest number possible. Sitting on market this 100 days, 120 days. Like it's just if you take your per an hour value there, like all you're doing is lowering your value. So we hit super hard, super impressive. Okay, super high level right in the beginning. Big flags, lots of signs, calling the neighbors. And then we finally get to the open house. Okay, and here's the key. If you guys have a pen and paper, I'll write this down. I'm about to drop the $300,000 script on you right now. Okay, no joke. This paid out $300,000 last year in GCI. They walk in the open house. And I go, hi, my name is Zach. So nice to meet you. Welcome to my open house. What's your name? DJ, awesome. DJ, so nice to meet you. Okay, this house is a three bedroom, two baths, 1500 square foot. Here's the flyer with all the information on the home. It has an ocean view deck off the top bedroom. I highly suggest you go check it out. And it's got a dog around over on the left hand side. So I suggest you go see that as well. Take as much time walk around the open house as you would like. I just asked one favor though. Can you meet me by the kitchen counter before you leave? So I can ask you a few questions about the home. They go, yeah, of course. No problem. I just gave you everything you wanted. People walk in an open house. I hear the agent, can you sign in please? Oh, hey, can you sign in please? Oh no, you have to sign in to get in. Okay, the people come in. I give them everything they want. I asked them my favor, which they say, of course, too, because I just gave them everything. The second they turn their body away from me, I go, oh, DJ, really quick. Can I get you to sign in for the homeowner? And what they just go and their brain, of course, wasn't the first priority was just to get me to sign up for some sheet. It was a second. It's like almost an afterthought. After a second. So sure, I'm going to go put in my real phone number, my real email, my real name, because this guy seems like a good guy. Like he's not trying to just go meet through a registration seat and then calling me a few days later. You know, I'm blowing me up. Like, so you guys, they're also, I'm sorry if anybody feels called out by this. Okay, but the worst question in real estate that humanly exists is what brought you in today. What are you expecting them to say? I just don't get, oh, I'm here to buy a house. Like, I just, you know, like, it's like, I'm assuming you're here to buy a house. You're inside an open house. So people walk in and I hear agents all the time, like, what brought you in today? Like, oh, we're just looking. And you're like, okay, shoot, okay. And instantly cuts it. You're just setting yourself up. But failure is to go. Instead of what brought you in today, move that over to the side and just, hey, gratitude. Thank you so much for coming into my open house today. I'm so grateful that you were able to come see me and my business. Today, not hence, I don't have to hang out in the corner on Instagram for three hours and not get paid for any of my time. Thank you so much for coming in. Like, so grateful for you coming in my open house today. And you start with gratitude. Yeah. You know, it's funny. I think as you were saying this idea of, you know, the O by the way, oh, well, real quickly. Could I get your, you know, your email address? You know, I think about this. There's so many applications for this. You know, it's thinking the same idea when you walk into a clothing store. And the salesperson comes up and the last thing you want them to do is come right up to you. Because you're like, I don't even know what I'm looking at yet. I, yeah, I'm here. But what they could do is they come and say, hey, hey, I know you, I know you want to start browsing. I'm going to let you do that. Here's where you men's clothes over here, over here, over here. I'm going to leave you alone. Just wanted to let you know where things were. I'm here if you need me. And then they, they can, okay, cool. They go, oh, by the way, we send out a lot of coupons and offers. Can I just grab your email real quick and then it's the same exact idea. And I don't know why restaurants don't do this before they see you. I don't, I mean, there's so much opportunity here. So that is the easy one. Because obviously everybody talks about car sales and like, you know, us being used car salesman. I know some great used car salesman. You guys just for everybody out there. But we have this wrap, you know, like that. So I tell everybody, imagine even me, I go to a car lot and I go, oh, my God, where, where is he going to come out of? He's going to pop out of the back of the truck because he's going to walk from the corner. Like, where is this guy going to come out of and not leave me alone? Because it is like a stereotype for that. And even I think it like an I'm in sales. So I imagine this and I told this to a car sale guy and he crushes it. Imagine somebody walks on the lot. They walked up and they said, hey, DJ, really quick. I'm going to let you look around and take as much time as you would need. I just wanted to give you a quick update. So all the Toyota's are over here. All the midside bands over here, the trucks okay, are back over there. Once again, take as much time to look around as you'd like. I just asked one favor. Can you stop by the front office before you go? That way I can just ask you a few questions about your vehicle purchase. And they're like, we'd be like, oh my God. Yeah, easy. Thank you. They'd be like, that's amazing. And then as I turn around and be like, oh, really quick. Could I get your contact information? Just like it sends you over. Like we have some cars. We're doing some amazing deals on it. And then you get it. It's like the secondary thought and they feel. Yeah, love it. So that's crucial. Stop forcing people to sign in right when they walk in the house. Give them all the value first. Log reparsity kicks in and they end up giving you what you want back now. You know, without even thinking about it. I love it. Okay. So any other tips for the open house or is that basically is at the, oh, are you do you have are you have refreshments? Do you have food? What are you doing? I'm looking for a drink. I'm looking for a drink. Look good. Feel good. Smell good. That goes for you and for the house. Okay. That's a rule of thumb. You should look good. Feel good. And hopefully you smell good. Okay. Same with the house. Hopefully it should look good. It's cleaned. Okay. There's not stuff everywhere. You have the closets closed. The toilet seats down. You know, windows open. Feel good. Okay. Get it a good temperature in there. Nobody wants to walk in this freaking, you know, warm, sweaty, you know, open house. Okay. And then smell good. Make it smell good. You guys, you don't need to don't go spray for breeze everywhere. Okay. That just suffocates people like just go. I literally got stuff one time at open house. The smell terrible. I didn't have anything on me. I literally they had a bunch of lemons. So I turn on the hot water and just squeeze a ton of lemons like in the sinks and stuff. And the house smell like fresh lemons. One of the best feedback I got actually was, wow, the house smells great. I was like, thanks. You know, appreciate it. But so look good. Feel good. It smells good. Okay. Feel good. Would mean music. You know, the echoes. You walk in an open house and you're, you hear yourself echoing in the room. Nobody wants to be there. Okay. This so they get out as if it could possibly. Right. Food. You know, we don't do like, we don't do like big cookie platters. You know, anything like that. We'll do like some chocolates or, you know, something really small, you know, an easy and then drinks. This is our big trick. A lot of people I walk in, they got like a $60 bottle of champagne. And I'm just like, damn, man, you're like, you know, like I guess you're crushing it. You know, your open house is, you guys, we use $2 bottles of champagne. Like buy a bunch of bottles of champagne. They're not there for the quality of champagne. They're there for the house. The champagne's about that. Okay. So get yourself some cheap champagne, you know, poured in some glasses and just look good, feel good, smell good. You're running a good open house at that point. Love it. So now they've left the open house. They've gone about their day. You've got their contact information. Maybe they stopped by and talked to you or maybe they didn't, but you've got the info. So it doesn't matter. So by the way, just had a curiosity. What percentage stop by you on the way out? I know you don't probably care so much about it, but just curious. Like what percentage actually? Okay, a question because everybody thinks it's really low. They think it's like 50% 25. If I've not been thrown out there, it's like over 80%. I'm not even joking. As long as you nail, what that is so, I'm showing you it shocking because it's, well, it's two parts on this. Okay, one, it's the law of reprocity. Okay, sure, that part's really important. You gave them everything. You made their life easy. What happens when you make someone's life easy as they make your life easy and return? Okay, and they don't make your life hard. You make somebody's life hard. AKA you force them to sign in within the first two seconds. You just made their life harder. They're going to make your life harder and they're going to get the heck out of that open house. You know, not answer the phone for you. Not to talk to you. Give you a fake phone number. AKA my life is harder now because of that. The second one, this is the key word here is favor. Favours make people feel good. People like doing favors for other people. Now, a request is very different. Hey, DJ, I'm going to ask that you meet me by the kitchen counter before you leave. That's very different. Yeah, that doesn't feel the same. It's a request is very different. We actually don't like requests. We don't like when people request things from us, it's a home evaluation or a showing. But it's that favor. Hey, DJ, would you mind doing me a favor? And they go, yeah, of course. I go, now it feels weird when I go meet me by the kitchen, I go, yeah, of course, that'd be great. It feels weird for them to just leave. Like they're like, okay, could we got to stop? You know, we got to at least stop and say hi. The second they walk up to the counter, this is super important. Because this is your ending really to your open house. Okay, they walk up to the counter, they walk up. I go, hey, DJ, wow, you guys got some time to look around the house. Let me ask you, do you want to write an offer? Okay, your worst question is, how did you like the house? That's a hard question to answer. Yeah, right. Nobody wants to answer that. Well, then they start thinking about the downfall. There's things I like, there's things I didn't like. I just got heart. I like yes or no questions to start always. Yes or no. So hey, DJ, ranking the house on a scale, you know, a one to 10, you know, what would you rank the home at? Eight, awesome, exciting, doesn't it mean you want to write an offer? Okay, you have to ask about the offer. I see so many people just letting people leave up the open house. Like I'll call them later, you know, and I'll follow up with them. Nobody good. No, not at all. Like my successful open house on the Saturday means I signed an agreement. I'm or I'm writing an offer and I get a lot of kick back on this from other teams, other agents, other everything. Where they're like, it's kind of pushy, you know, and it's kind of this. I go tell that to all my agents that have escros right now for open houses on the open house they held. And all they're doing is, oh, yeah, you want to write an offer? They go, yeah, it's actually a really nice house. And they go awesome. Has anyone walked you through the seven steps of a winning offer? They haven't. Oh my gosh, we need to set up a call later tonight when I'm done with the open house and work on this winning offer for you. But you just need to ask you guys in this in this world. You need to ask what you want. You can't just expect it to fall in your lap. So if you're not asking them for you want, they're not going to give it to you. I want to write an offer on this house. So I'm going to ask people to write an offer on this house. And one of them is probably going to do it. Yeah, it's funny. I was when I moved into my, when I moved into the condo I currently live in. It was a new development and the developer or actually a representative for the developer came along on one of the show. He says he had to let us in because it was still being constructed and they had certain access that couldn't get to. So he walks us over and he's not the, he's not the agent. He's just the guy working for the developer. And we asked him, what about this or this? We asked our agent, what about this or this or this? Because we didn't know all the answers. And he says write an offer and find out. And he was kind of being cheeky and a little funny. And I was like, yeah, that's a good point. He probably would, they're going to answer these questions, which were like, could you do this for us? Could you do this for us? They want to see that we're serious. And it made me think, holy crap, I got to write an offer because, and he's a good guy. I didn't think he was being pushed. He was just trying to get these things sold. And there's something about this idea that what you said is, is, are you, are you ready to make an offer? Would you like to make an offer? Is your presupposing that people want to make offers? And psychologically, there's a little bit of a, of an urgency aspect to it. Now again, you're not a creepy sales guy. So you don't have to worry about being a creepy sales guy. You're just not. So you can say things that maybe other person might sound like a creepy sales guy doing it. Don't worry, you're not that person. You're a good person. So this idea of, hey, do you want to make an offer? And it's not, I'm trying to sell you this home. It's just so, you know, first of all, they're going to see all the traffic going in and out. They're going to understand that there's urgency and you're actually helping them. You're actually saying, hey, would you, are you thinking about making an offer? You know, it's important that I know this because there's a lot of people coming through. You know what I'm saying? Once again, this is a big one. You guys, you're selling the house. That's your job. Your job isn't for the buyer's agent and standing inside of an open house. That doesn't make a ton of sense. So like, I see a lot. Buyers walk up to the counter or they call their, you know, the open house, you know, visitor like a few days after some like that. And they're just like, so why don't you break down for me what you're looking for in a home? I'm like, bro, how about sell that house first? You know, in the second they say no to that house, then I can be the buyer's agent. So if I go, hey, DJ, do you want to write an offer on this house? You like them? They go, oh, no, no, no, no, we just started looking. How exciting. Why don't you break down for me what you're looking for in a new home? Now I can be the buyer's agent, you know, and step in and be this, but you guys, people want to work with an impressive agent in general. So be the impressive agent, your job that you're there. Okay, to be at a K selling the house. So try to sell the house. Okay, be like being inside of a target. You walk inside a target. You're like, hey, I want to check out with this closing. I'm like, hey, do you actually know they have this cheaper over at Walmart? I'd be like, you're weird. I'd be like, what, I just want to buy this right now. Like I just, what, I don't know, that's weird to me. I'm not going to go drive to Walmart now. Like you should be selling me on this shirt that I have in my hand, you know, right here. So that's what you're doing inside of the open house. So you're literally somebody's walking into Best Buy and you're saying it's cheaper over at Target. It's just weird. Yeah, it's weird. Okay, so they, so now they've left. You've got their contact information at the beginning. You 80% of the time are getting some sort of conversation at the end of the open house, which is finding out how interested they are, whether they want to make an offer on this one or they're looking at other properties, either way, it's a win for you. You know, if they have another agent, obviously you'll find that out. And then now the open house is concluded. So now what's the follow up process? What are you doing that either evening or next? My favorite, one of my favorite parts of the process, typically because of the face I get, when we talk about it, 21 touches and seven days. Okay, is what an open house should have seven, the following seven days. Okay, I've come in and you're open house. That's gonna be calls, that's gonna be emails, that's gonna be text messages, it's gonna be property alerts, it's gonna be videos. Okay, so our actual plan, and once again, you guys can literally write this down. Okay, is the day of the open house, not Monday, okay, Saturday after the open house, we're calling them. If they don't answer the phone, we're taking a video from inside the open house. Okay, so a lot of our agents will just do this before they leave the open house. Okay, they take the video and say, hey, DJ, it was such a pleasure meeting at my open house today. I just want to, you know, I'm working hard on exactly what we talked about, and I'd love to set up, you know, whatever it is. You know, it's there, but so it's a call, they don't answer. Then they get a text with a video and they're getting a property alert all in the same day, no matter what. Like that is the key. So it's three touches right there. The second you wait till Monday, they've gone in seven other open houses. Every other agent's calling them on Monday. You guys need to stop watching what all these other agents are doing and copying them, because the fact that 70% of agents didn't do a deal last year, and you're following what all those other agents are doing, eh, it's just, or one deal, I mean, it's just like that's a hard one, where nobody's calling them day up. Do what nobody else is doing. Call them day up, get them on a property alert, send them the video, hey, it was so nice to meet you. I'm so grateful for having you in my world now. What can I do to assist you in buying a home? Something like it doesn't matter, just be impressive and be there. Don't wait till Monday, like everybody else. It's just average, you know, they sense it. How are you taking notes along the way to make sure you remember anything of note because you have to be taking notes. So how are you doing that? Are you using a digital system? Are you using pen and paper? We're big on tech. I'm very luckily of my business partner Brett, a computer major, and so we get to use his tech brain, you know, for everything, but we use a system called lofty as our CRM, if you ever heard a lofty, okay? We've been with them, sure, probably when they were chime, you know, originally for about, honestly, it's probably been over five years now, actually, that we've been with them, it's been a long time. But so we use the virtual sign-in sheet and one of my favorite parts of it is that right after the lead submits, it leaves this little window right there for the agent to go and put in a few notes really quick and then submit, and it goes in with the lead. Outside of that, they have a pen and paper. I'm big on letting people see that I'm taking notes. I think agents try to like hide, like, oh my God, I don't want them to see my pen and paper that I have here in my note. You guys, it's like good. When the waiter doesn't wipe down my order in front of my face, I'm like, yeah, you freak out a little bit. You're like, you get that? I'm like, you got me back, right? This dude just screwed up my whole night. My dinner is gonna come out wrong. And that's like right on my brain is that where if somebody's in front of me, just writing, okay, they're looking for a three-bedroom, two bath, okay, yeah, get it up. It's impressive. It just means you're like, are actually listening to what's going on. So if it's after they come to the kitchen counter, they're typically doing it on like a note pad, you know, so they can witness you taking notes. Sure. Okay, got it. So you're doing the three touches, we don't have to go through every touch, but basically you're continuing a psych a version of that cycle for the next, what, do you say seven days? So there's 21 touches for seven days of the goal after that. It will typically bounce back to like a few times a week, you know, like two or three times a week. We have an ISA team that calls our open house leads, you know, as well, just to make it easy. So the agents getting their touches, then the ISA is coming in and getting the touches typically, within about 90 days, we can call a week bump, you know, or not bump. And it's not that we throw them away. We just move them kind of out of our face and let some AI emails and stuff work on them. Like we want to get the hot ready to go. That's why we do our agents all do four open houses a month. Okay, it's just our standard that we hold, you know, four open houses because we know out of four open houses, we're going to get at least one escrow. Like it's just, I use CISU, then anybody's here heard a CISU, shout out Brian and spring. Oh my gosh, CISU is freaking amazing. So there's no guessing here. Like I know four open houses gets us at least one escrow. You know, it's, it's really unbelievable. We're talking about just running a system that we know other agents are not willing to do. The other agents, you really don't have any competition when it comes to other open houses. Nobody's seen anything like this before. The experience for the customer walking in is a positive experience. You're giving them value, you're leaving them alone, you're doing all the things they want you to do and you're still getting the information you want and now they're in your database. And Zach knows something very, very important, this important statistic and he might even have a different number than I have, but I ask chat GPT, this is what chat GPT says. And Zach now has these people in his database and he knows that at least 10 to 15% of every one of those people in his database is going to use a real estate agent in the next 12 months. That's just what the numbers say. So the more people he's got in that database, not just the people he has in the database. The people he has in there, the number of them and the number of times he's branding himself and reminding those people, I'm a professional, this is what I do, I'm here to help. Buh, buh, buh, buh. He is going to win the majority of those deals. So you are just expanding your database every single week. Yeah, they have a CRM right now that has 1.5 million people inside of it. I see agents show me databases that they like to do. My CRM is so busy, I can barely keep up with my tasks. Oh my gosh, they open it, it's like 50 people inside. I'm like, man, we got 1.5 million people inside of here. Like we're rolling. We're like, I'm all about the mass. Bring me the homeowners, bring me the buyers, bring me expi- like bring me everybody here and put them in my bubble. You know, because I just want to look impressive. All right. Well, you are impressive to me as somebody who interviews top agents all over the country. You absolutely without exception have the best open house strategy I've ever heard of. It's an absolute no-brainer. Does it require more work? Sure it does. So does everything in life that's worthwhile. It requires a little bit more work. But it's worth it. It's worth it. Yeah, it's worth it. It's not, there's no worrying because you've set up yourself to win and you're willing to put in the work too. That, okay, so let's, I think, you know, I want to have you back on the show because there's so many other aspects of this business that I know you have great systems for. So I want to talk to you about coming on more regularly. But before we end the show, I want everybody to, like obviously Zach has lots of good information to share. So I want to, let's talk about FamCamp. Your company is fam. Let's talk about what you do for agents because you turn agents into closers in just two weeks. So FamCamp is my baby. Okay, we've built FamCamp over the last five years and I can very 100% confidently say that FamCamp is the absolute best way for an agent to get in production. And I say that just based off track records. You guys can, I'm all about numbers. Okay, I'm not about guesswork here. So what FamCamp is is a two week boot camp. Okay, it's from 7 a.m. to 8 a.m. Okay, we do it for two weeks. Week one is all about systems and tech. Okay, so we don't train on sales and tech and manage all this at one time. It's just too much. So week one is the CRM fellow, how do you use our Google business, how do you slack, how do you use your tech stack, how do you use all these tools that are in your tool belt. Week two, we then move on to sales. You know, we're moving on to prospecting. So that's you're doing your first open houses, you're calling the neighbors around it, you're getting some older leads, we're calling your SOI. Okay, so our last FamCamp was five, was seven people. Okay, they went through the last one, that was about 60, or sorry, a little bit for 90 days ago. Two of them did not make it through, they tapped out. Okay, through which is why we have it. It's not, our model is not for everybody, well aware, you know, we're not perfect for everybody, but we're exceptional for some, okay. And during that two week process, and then 90 days following, that's always our goals. What does the next 90 days of somebody's career look like? Every single five of those agents have closed transactions. Okay, one of them has two sign listings right now, a closed buyer and another buyer signed on an agreement. The other one has four BBRAs signed, four buyer agreements. Like, you guys, it's just, it's not a complicated system, it's just hard work. You know, so it's an intense two weeks, but oh my God, is it worth it? You know, for what you pop out on the other side, and our goal is that FamCamp mixed with a 30, 60, 90, okay. The following days after is that you're in production, not that you have a signed agreement, not that you have a little bit of a pipeline that you have a closed transaction. That's being in production, is getting a paycheck. So that's our goal of the FamCamp, the 30, 60, 90, our current group of campers are just finishing up week one. This week, they've achieved two appointments. They've achieved 20, or sorry, 39 Google reviews. Like, what agents even have reviews right now, and our FamCampers don't even have experience. They have 39 reviews in the matter of seven days, and they've added about 185 SOI into the database. So like, once again, it's a simple, replicative process that I can be 100% confident in working as long as you're right for the environment, you know that you're being started. So if you just want to work a bunch of leads, no, FamCamp doesn't typically work for you. Real estate doesn't typically work, sorry. You know for you, but if you want to come in and you want to grow a pipeline, master your craft, is there really key word here? And get your first signed agreements in the process, your first closing, that's really what FamCamp, the 30, 69, you has designed around. And if someone is interested in doing, and again, this is what you just have one hour a day for the next two weeks. It's two weeks for one hour a day, it's not a big commitment. And this is why I think it's funny. We get people that tap out halfway through because of time and I go perfect. I go, if you can't get one hour a day for two weeks, I'm sorry, real estate is going to be a really hard road, you know for you to come. And I like that you started early in the morning too because that also has a demonstration of commitment. It's, look, you're probably not really starting your day at 7 a.m. most people in the country. So if you're willing to put in a little bit extra work so that you can be present and do some actual work from 7 to 8, you're probably at least on the right track because you're right. You're going to have to get up, you're going to have to work long hours in this business. I'll end it with one story, you guys. I always like to say what is the possible instead of what is going to happen because everybody's different. Okay, but the possible is we had an agent who joined our team last year. She did real estate for about six months of last year, first year in real estate, okay? She did $10 million. Okay, in six months of real estate. Currently for this year already, she's on track to do $22 million at 22 years old. And, you know, we think boy, who's giving, you know, who's listing or using a buyer or who's a buyer or a seller, who's using a 22 year old, right? We're like, that doesn't happen. Well, she's also doing it in the second most competitive market that exists in the United States. And she's signing, she has four escros right now and five listing signed for 2025. The work works. I promise you, just stop avoiding the work. That's the number one thing. Agents avoid the work too early. The work works. I absolutely promise you. Zach, send real estate is where you go to learn about all things Zach and his team, fam, for fam, realty group, they are in SoCal, but they work with agents all over the country. So please, even if you're in Delaware, you're somewhere else and you're like, I need to learn from somebody like Zach or from Zach directly. You're gonna want to reach out to him, Zach's in real estate on Instagram. Zach, is there another way that people should check out? Yeah, if you want you can go to my YouTube, you know, as well. You guys, I'm in a book, you know, I don't hide anything. A lot of our like recorded team trainings are on YouTube. Like I'm just posting our actual trainings. I'm not doing like a top five things that close and expired. Like it's our actual live team trainings that we're doing. So my YouTube is just Zach, guys in Dwarfer. Okay, Zach, ZAC, H, guys in Dwarfer, GEI, SEM, and you'll see it pop up right away. There's not many Zach guys in Dwarfers. Okay, on there, but GEI, SEM, DOR, FER. Okay, those are literally recorded trainings from our team. If you want to go on my Instagram and click a link to book with me, you'll literally get an hour of my time on a strategy session for free. You guys absolutely for free. So if you want to sit down and just say a little bit of a business audit or a scripting session, whatever it is that you think your business is, like let's just do it. Why not? Like why not let's just show up? You know what I didn't hear you say today was, you know, it's really a bummer because rates are so high, inventory is so low, and those are true. Yeah, those are true. Those are affecting people. I didn't hear you talk about that. And wonder why? Because you don't, it doesn't matter to you. You're running your chopping wood and carrying water, no matter what the market conditions are. And you know that all you have to do is maybe adjust your strategy here and there according to market conditions, but it's literally, like you said, trust the process, trust the work. The work works. Yeah, so I think that's just in life. Don't just not just in real estate and life. Like don't focus on the things you can't control. Like rates and the market, you know, all these things, sure, I like to know the theme of the market is what I like to call it. It is my theme buyers right now. Is it sellers? Is it like what is my theme at the moment? But you guys, you spend so much time. I talked to agent like my last year was so hard. Just the rates were high or because you know, because of this. Because I'm like, why are you putting your business in control of something that you can't control? Like that just doesn't make a ton of sense to me. And I want to ask one final question because nobody is perfect and everyone's business has imperfections. And this will just humanize that a little bit and let us know that he has challenges because we always, always have challenges. What is a current challenge in your business? And we're, you know, what are you thinking? How are you thinking? Totally. So a big one for us is in social media. Okay, we were very behind the ring on social media. It's funny. Most people do social media to get production. We actually were doing production to show off on social media. We kind of had the wrong concept. So really building our social media was a big tool that we lacked for many, many years, actually, for about four years of our team. We did a little bit. We posted. We hired some companies, but nothing was really a brand, you know, that we were able to create. So it's funny. We're kind of doing it the opposite as most teams. But so our big goal for this year is to really brand really heavy, create more online presence, more social media presence, YouTube, Instagram. We were way behind, you know, on that. So we just hired an in-house media team, about 15 employees that now from the editing, they tell us, Hey, Zach, you need to get us a video. They go, you haven't sent us a video. I'm like, two days. I'm like, cool, got it. My bad. Like, you know, I just don't think about it. So social was a big one for us that we really wished we were stronger in over the last few years. And our goal for 2025 is that we have a really strong social presence, you know, at the end of the year. And I love that you've built this entire process in team with essentially very little to know social media presence in your young guy. It's not like you're a six-year-old guy. He's like, well, I just got a huge network of friends. I wish I was a social media guy. You're like, no, no, everybody I know is on social all day long. And I didn't really do that. And look where I'm at. And I did 100 homes. And I'm on PROSP past to do 222 this year. Oh, and yeah, I need to actually get my social media up and running. And I'm working on that. But that is awesome. So I appreciate you being vulnerable and sharing, hey, my business ain't isn't perfect. Either nobody's business is. But you've got some really strong process. And guys, if this was a value, I mean, I know it was, let me know that it was a value to you. Let shoot, shoot me a message. This helps me know what you like. I know you like Zach. You want to hear more of Zach? I'd like to hear more of Zach. So, you know, if Zach was like a really good, I mean, gosh, this truly is one of the best episodes I think we've ever done. Not because of me, but because of Zach. So if this was super valuable to you, do, do, do be two favors. One, shoot me a message on social or, you know, whatever, you can find me. I'm easy. Find me. Let me know if you appreciated this and also let Zach know. That would really even be better. Let him know how much you appreciate. But also tell another agent about this episode. Shoot them a link every agent in the country should really hear this. He just gave all of you his entire strategy for free. Didn't ask for anything from you. He's a good guy. That's pretty awesome.
