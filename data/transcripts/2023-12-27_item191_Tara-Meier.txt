[00:04:27] Tara, welcome to the show.
[00:04:30] Thank you.
[00:04:30] Thanks for having me.
[00:04:32] I have to say, my very first real girlfriend in life
[00:04:35] was named Tara.
[00:04:36] And so, and I haven't thought of that name
[00:04:39] in a very, very long time.
[00:04:40] So I'm having these weird flashbacks to my early 20s
[00:04:44] of going, this painful relationship
[00:04:48] that was a million years ago.
[00:04:50] And actually, she's old.
[00:04:52] She's a lovely person.
[00:04:53] Everybody's first relationship was terrible, I think.
[00:04:56] So, but it is funny.
[00:04:58] I haven't talked to too many Tara since then.
[00:05:02] And I had a moment where I was like,
[00:05:05] why am I thinking about my, oh, that's right.
[00:05:06] They have the same name.
[00:05:07] So, I knew I was just kind of a cute story.
[00:05:10] But she's married, has kids.
[00:05:12] She's doing great.
[00:05:13] But anyway, let's talk about some fun stuff today
[00:05:16] because I'm a marketing person as well.
[00:05:19] You're a marketing person.
[00:05:20] You're about systems and branding and marketing.
[00:05:24] And we're going to talk about all that fun stuff.
[00:05:26] As opposed to just how do you grow your business?
[00:05:28] Which is what I do on every other episode,
[00:05:30] which is really fun and exciting too.
[00:05:32] But people really want to hear about systems and marketing.
[00:05:35] So, let's talk about that.
[00:05:37] But before we do, I do want to find out
[00:05:39] how you got into the business.
[00:05:41] How did you start in real estate and why?
[00:05:44] Yeah.
[00:05:45] So, in 2002, I found myself at the front desk
[00:05:49] of a title insurance company.
[00:05:51] I spent 10 years at first American title,
[00:05:54] kind of doing various positions.
[00:05:57] I grew from, like I said, a receptionist.
[00:06:00] I did Escort of Spursments and signings
[00:06:02] and finished off as an examiner on the title side.
[00:06:07] Shortly after that, I was recruited by an agent
[00:06:11] who liked my title background.
[00:06:13] He was focused primarily in RIO at that time.
[00:06:17] So, that was around 2010.
[00:06:19] And I helped him with, I mean, he was a one-man show
[00:06:24] running like 30, various 30 to 50 RIO dispositions at one time.
[00:06:31] So, it was all things vendor management and cash for keys
[00:06:35] and some of those, not so sexy things.
[00:06:40] And then from there, I transitioned,
[00:06:43] I got my license in Arizona 2012.
[00:06:46] I was a successful agent.
[00:06:49] I think I did roughly around 150 transactions
[00:06:52] between 2012 to 2019 when I also got my broker's license.
[00:06:58] And then I quickly decided, I decided I wanted to pivot
[00:07:01] and do something new.
[00:07:02] And so I went into Prop Deck.
[00:07:04] That where I was a supervisor and a program manager
[00:07:07] for Zillow offers.
[00:07:09] And I learned all things scaling and how to operate
[00:07:15] with well-managed people as well as work
[00:07:19] with some of the most top producing agents
[00:07:21] in the Western United States that were affiliated
[00:07:23] with Zillow offers at that time.
[00:07:25] Sure.
[00:07:26] They unfortunately went through a line down,
[00:07:28] which everybody knows about.
[00:07:29] I didn't get it.
[00:07:30] We all know Zillow offers
[00:07:33] is no more.
[00:07:34] By the way, I know a lot of people have strong feelings
[00:07:37] about Zillow in general.
[00:07:39] I do not have those same strong feelings.
[00:07:41] I am a big fan of tech companies.
[00:07:44] Zillow, will they ultimately try to replace agents?
[00:07:48] I guess they say they won't.
[00:07:50] But regardless, I think Zillow really does act
[00:07:54] to really help agents more than,
[00:07:56] and I know that not everyone agrees with that.
[00:07:58] But I am a fan of Zillow.
[00:08:00] Actually, they used to be a sponsor of my show
[00:08:01] and I face to have them on the show all the time.
[00:08:03] So I'm a big fan.
[00:08:04] Yeah, it was a great company to work for.
[00:08:07] I learned a lot about culture
[00:08:08] and just how to operate in a high capacity.
[00:08:13] So I really valued my time there
[00:08:15] and some fortunate that it ended,
[00:08:17] but things happen for a reason.
[00:08:19] It was just bad timing, not you,
[00:08:22] but it was just timing with the market and everything.
[00:08:25] And it wasn't the only company like that
[00:08:30] or division of a company like that to go under
[00:08:32] pretty much most of them did.
[00:08:34] So it wasn't exclusive to Zillow.
[00:08:36] But so you pivoted, you were doing that
[00:08:38] and then that ended and then where'd you go from there?
[00:08:42] Yeah, so then I was picked up by another
[00:08:44] Proptech company, actually called it Workshored
[00:08:46] and I was the general manager
[00:08:47] and launched the Phoenix market here.
[00:08:50] And they also went through a wind down.
[00:08:53] So it was there for about a year and a half.
[00:08:54] So my 10 year in Proptech lasted about four years.
[00:08:59] And then I was like, okay, I need to do something different.
[00:09:01] Maybe I just need to go back into real estate.
[00:09:03] And so I was kind of playing with that
[00:09:05] and trying to relaunch my indie career
[00:09:07] at the worst time, probably possible.
[00:09:11] And while we were kind of going through
[00:09:13] with these high interest rates and everything of 2022
[00:09:16] and 2023, and then I was actually approached by
[00:09:20] or I followed a friend of mine, Aaron Lyce,
[00:09:23] who's also an MTD for my home.
[00:09:26] And he had kind of sent out in SOS.
[00:09:29] I'm looking for somebody who's really into marketing
[00:09:30] and can help me kind of grow what I'm doing here.
[00:09:33] And so I reached out to him and was like,
[00:09:34] wow, this sounds really fun.
[00:09:36] And I don't know if I have the chops for it,
[00:09:37] but I'm willing to give it a try.
[00:09:40] And it just made sense because it was like,
[00:09:43] even throughout my entire real estate career,
[00:09:46] that was the thing that I focused on the most
[00:09:47] was the marketing technology piece.
[00:09:50] I was in charge of doing the websites.
[00:09:52] I was in charge of doing all of the lead gen
[00:09:56] of setting up our online presence
[00:09:58] of doing all of these things.
[00:10:00] And so I have a knack for it and a passion
[00:10:03] for helping others.
[00:10:04] And I'm also, this kind of side hustle,
[00:10:08] but I'm also a CrossFit coach.
[00:10:10] And so I love helping people just lifting them up
[00:10:16] and helping them navigate complex things,
[00:10:20] whether that's how to do a snatch or a clean and jerk
[00:10:23] or navigating how to figure out how to put together
[00:10:27] a Facebook post.
[00:10:28] So I have one CrossFit question for you.
[00:10:32] I don't know that this is a CrossFit move necessarily,
[00:10:35] but in fact, it's funny.
[00:10:37] I was telling Tara, I go,
[00:10:38] I have to leave it to a clock.
[00:10:39] And the reason I have to leave
[00:10:40] is I have a personal training session,
[00:10:42] not CrossFit, but I do like a weightlifter workout.
[00:10:45] But when I was gonna ask you,
[00:10:46] because I've only seen CrossFit people do this.
[00:10:48] And for everyone else who's listening,
[00:10:50] like, shut up, get to the real estate stuff.
[00:10:51] But I just wanna ask one quick question.
[00:10:53] Is, can you do a muscle up?
[00:10:55] Is that a, do you know what a muscle up is?
[00:10:58] Those are insane.
[00:11:00] 
[00:11:00] You can do one?
[00:11:01] Oh yeah, I can do them on the rings
[00:11:03] and I can do them on the bar.
[00:11:04] So either one.
[00:11:05] So I want everybody to know what Tara just said
[00:11:08] means she is the strongest person
[00:11:10] to have ever been on this podcast.
[00:11:11] Because she will tell you,
[00:11:13] it is one of the hardest things you can possibly do
[00:11:16] as an exercise.
[00:11:17] And literally I've had on NFL football players
[00:11:20] on the show that cannot do that.
[00:11:22] So that is incredible.
[00:11:23] So you are a very fit person.
[00:11:25] That is incredible.
[00:11:26] Oh, if I had athlete, yes.
[00:11:28] Yes.
[00:11:30] Oh my gosh, that is amazing.
[00:11:31] And guys, if you don't know what that is,
[00:11:32] Google muscle up.
[00:11:33] It doesn't look as hard.
[00:11:35] Just give it a try.
[00:11:36] And if you could even, anyway, all right,
[00:11:39] let's get to the fun stuff.
[00:11:39] But the reason I'm saying this is my trainer
[00:11:41] just got her, did her first muscle up ever,
[00:11:44] it took her a year to get there.
[00:11:45] And she's like the strongest person I know.
[00:11:47] So that's really, really impressive.
[00:11:49] So discipline is not a problem for you.
[00:11:51] Is what I'm guessing.
[00:11:53] No, it is not a problem.
[00:11:55] I love trying to figure things out,
[00:11:56] whether it be a muscle up or walking down my hands
[00:12:00] or how to get somebody to look at my website.
[00:12:05] 
[00:12:06] Let's start with online presence.
[00:12:08] So REALTORS, I agree.
[00:12:10] Most of them have little to no online presence
[00:12:14] with the exception of, hey, I just sold this home
[00:12:17] or I just listed this property
[00:12:19] and I'm gonna throw a pretty boring post on Facebook
[00:12:22] or Instagram.
[00:12:23] That's usually about it.
[00:12:26] Let's talk about what agents can do in 2024
[00:12:30] to really provide value to their followers
[00:12:34] on social media because,
[00:12:35] and I wanna get your opinion on this,
[00:12:37] I believe the best way to really garner interest
[00:12:40] is to provide some sort of content
[00:12:45] that isn't all just about, look at how great I am,
[00:12:48] but more about here's some maybe questions
[00:12:50] or some answers to questions that you, Mr. and Mrs. Follower,
[00:12:53] might have or here's some content
[00:12:55] that you just would find interesting.
[00:12:57] So I'd love to get your overall philosophy
[00:12:59] on online branding, especially with social media.
[00:13:04] Oh gosh, yeah.
[00:13:05] So so much to talk about there.
[00:13:07] So first and foremost, am I,
[00:13:10] online presence is probably the most important thing
[00:13:14] that a real estate agent can do.
[00:13:15] I mean, 90% of people are going online and Googling you,
[00:13:20] whether you are a referral or whether they see
[00:13:22] a postcard coming the mail, they're gonna be Googling you,
[00:13:25] they're gonna be checking out who you are,
[00:13:28] what you stand for, what your online marketing looks like
[00:13:33] before they decide to pick up a phone and call you.
[00:13:36] And so,
[00:13:36] also your friends are going to do the same thing.
[00:13:40] So don't assume that just because you work
[00:13:42] a referral based business, meaning your clients refer
[00:13:44] or it's your sphere of influence,
[00:13:47] those people are also going to search you.
[00:13:49] Yeah, and that's, you know, a common misconception right now
[00:13:53] is that referrals will just pick up the phone and call
[00:13:55] and that was maybe true five years ago.
[00:13:57] Now, on average, it's taking them two to three weeks
[00:14:00] of research before they actually decide to pick up
[00:14:03] the phone and call.
[00:14:05] So, online presence number one is showing up consistently
[00:14:09] so that it's not confusing, you know,
[00:14:11] all of these online platforms like zelo.com,
[00:14:14] redspin, Realtor.com, homes.com,
[00:14:17] they're all going to create profiles for you,
[00:14:19] whether you like it or not,
[00:14:21] because they are fed from the IDX feeds.
[00:14:24] And so it's important that you go in
[00:14:26] and you take control of what people see from you.
[00:14:29] And so that means updating, adding a profile photo,
[00:14:34] if there's an opportunity to showcase a banner
[00:14:36] like in Realtor.com, you should do that.
[00:14:38] Make sure your bio is up to date and accurate,
[00:14:41] not outdated, and also ensuring that all of your links
[00:14:45] work to your various platforms.
[00:14:47] Google Business is one that's, you know,
[00:14:50] I think way under leverage right now for real estate agents.
[00:14:53] And it's so important because you can drive all of your
[00:14:57] reviews there and it's the first thing people see
[00:14:59] when they Google your name.
[00:15:01] And there's a lot of ways to optimize it for
[00:15:04] hyper local type content.
[00:15:08] And when you talk about content, you know,
[00:15:09] whether you're posting it on social media.
[00:15:11] So if you're into doing Facebook, YouTube, TikTok,
[00:15:16] Instagram, all of those, I think it's great.
[00:15:18] I personally don't think that you need to be
[00:15:21] an influencer on any of those platforms
[00:15:23] in order to have a successful business.
[00:15:25] But what I do think you need to do is you need to show.
[00:15:28] If you decide to show up on one of those,
[00:15:30] you need to be present and you need to engage
[00:15:34] on a consistent basis.
[00:15:36] So, you know, we look at different platforms like they are
[00:15:39] going to give you kind of either a positive result,
[00:15:42] a neutral result or a negative one.
[00:15:45] And profiles that you have kind of out there,
[00:15:47] like maybe you have a Twitter or none on his ex platform
[00:15:51] that you've had for five years and you don't do
[00:15:53] anything on it.
[00:15:54] It almost kind of gives that like negative,
[00:15:56] wow, is she open?
[00:15:57] Get rid of it.
[00:15:59] Yeah, get rid of it if you're not using it
[00:16:00] because nobody likes to see last post 2018.
[00:16:04] You're like, well, it just appears
[00:16:06] that you've abandoned something, right?
[00:16:09] Totally, totally.
[00:16:11] And, you know, there are certain things
[00:16:16] that are good about having some of those platforms.
[00:16:19] But like I said, if you're not on there,
[00:16:21] consistently using it, posting consistently,
[00:16:25] then get off of it.
[00:16:26] And then with regards to content,
[00:16:30] I'm with you.
[00:16:31] Like I think that, you know, gone are the days
[00:16:35] when just posting at house for sale is going to be exciting.
[00:16:38] I mean, I'm to the point I don't know about you,
[00:16:40] but if I see it, I just scroll right by.
[00:16:42] And now people want to, they want to be entertained,
[00:16:47] they want to be informed, they want to be inspired.
[00:16:50] And so you really kind of have to identify your audience.
[00:16:54] Number one, that's probably when you venture
[00:16:56] into this content producing realm,
[00:16:59] as you need to identify who your audience is going to be.
[00:17:02] And that includes like uncovering like,
[00:17:05] what are their consistent struggles?
[00:17:08] What are their problems?
[00:17:08] What do they want to know?
[00:17:10] What are they asking online?
[00:17:12] And there's a ton of different resources for you out there
[00:17:15] to kind of figure that out.
[00:17:16] Like Chatchy BT is a great resource.
[00:17:18] You can use it to help you identify your audience
[00:17:23] in your niche, or if you have a niche,
[00:17:25] like what are some of those, you know,
[00:17:27] common questions that you can maybe answer
[00:17:29] on some of your posts.
[00:17:32] And so, so identify your audience.
[00:17:34] That's probably like the biggest thing, yeah.
[00:17:37] Yeah, so I just jumping in just because you said
[00:17:40] a lot of really great stuff there.
[00:17:41] So here's what guys, if you're like, well,
[00:17:44] I sort of don't know my audience,
[00:17:46] what my target audience is.
[00:17:48] Well, think about if you've worked with clients in the past,
[00:17:51] who did you enjoy working with the most?
[00:17:52] Was it a certain demographic?
[00:17:54] Maybe an age range, maybe a certain type of buyer
[00:17:57] or seller first time versus maybe the investor
[00:17:59] or whatever you enjoyed, you know,
[00:18:02] and you can literally then type that into Chatchy
[00:18:05] for if you wanted to work with first time home buyers,
[00:18:07] for example, and I would want to know
[00:18:09] what's the average age of a first time home buyer?
[00:18:11] Okay, well, that you can ask Chatchy BT that.
[00:18:13] And then I would say, hey, Chatchy BT,
[00:18:16] what are, give me 10 common concerns
[00:18:19] that a first time home buyer has
[00:18:20] or hear 20 questions that a first time home buyer may have
[00:18:24] or what might a first time home buyer be searching for
[00:18:27] on Google or Facebook or Instagram or YouTube?
[00:18:31] You can literally just ask these questions to Chatchy BT
[00:18:34] and it won't always be perfect answers,
[00:18:37] but you will get a lot of good data that way.
[00:18:39] A ton of good data.
[00:18:41] And I would say, don't be afraid to reiterate
[00:18:43] your question, the original question that you asked
[00:18:45] because so many people I hear, you know, like,
[00:18:47] yeah, I answered a couple of questions
[00:18:49] and it kind of came back with gibberish.
[00:18:51] Like you have to, there's a science in an art to the prompt.
[00:18:54] You have to tell it who you are.
[00:18:56] So on a real estate agent in this specific area,
[00:18:59] I want to know what, you know,
[00:19:03] what home buyers, first time home buyers
[00:19:05] are struggling with in the FedEx area.
[00:19:08] So and then give me 10 ideas for content to use
[00:19:12] on social media.
[00:19:14] So you have to be very specific.
[00:19:17] Otherwise, it will, you know, go off
[00:19:19] and who knows what kind of direction.
[00:19:21] Yeah, but it is really cool too because if you think like,
[00:19:24] okay, if one of the questions comes back with
[00:19:27] Chatchy BT saying, hey, neighborhood selection
[00:19:30] or suburb selection is one of the biggest challenges
[00:19:33] for new first time home buyers.
[00:19:35] Like, oh, that makes sense.
[00:19:36] Well, guess what guys?
[00:19:37] You can now create content going,
[00:19:39] here's how people choose neighborhoods or here's,
[00:19:42] or here's let's do a tour of a neighborhood.
[00:19:44] You know, the content is really endless.
[00:19:47] What you really want to find is how,
[00:19:49] what really all you're doing is answering
[00:19:51] the questions first time home buyers
[00:19:52] or whatever your demographic is has.
[00:19:55] And I love that when it gives you the 10 ideas
[00:19:58] and then you say, okay, I want to elaborate on number one
[00:20:01] and then it'll give you like 10 more ideas
[00:20:03] or you can break it up into like a script for YouTube.
[00:20:07] You know, you can just continue to get more
[00:20:09] and more granular as you go down the chat
[00:20:12] until you get like, you know, get to the gold, I guess.
[00:20:16] And for anyone who's looking for the free version
[00:20:18] of Chatchy BT, yes, you can Google it and find it.
[00:20:22] I personally, if you're not going to pay for it,
[00:20:24] you don't probably have to at this point.
[00:20:27] Down the road, yeah, there's going to be
[00:20:29] some additional functionality you want to have access to.
[00:20:31] But I personally, I never search on Bing,
[00:20:33] but Bing Microsoft owns Chatchy BT.
[00:20:36] So inside of the Bing app, they have,
[00:20:39] the Chatchy BT is in there and it's pretty well updated,
[00:20:41] I think to 2022.
[00:20:43] So it's pretty current with information
[00:20:45] and you can literally just speak to it.
[00:20:47] So if you don't have the Bing app, download it
[00:20:49] just to use it for Chatchy BT.
[00:20:51] That's a little my pro tip.
[00:20:52] Sorry, Tara, go right ahead.
[00:20:53] Awesome, no, I love it.
[00:20:54] I love it.
[00:20:55] I think that I was at the end of my,
[00:20:57] did I answer all of your questions?
[00:20:59] I think so, yeah.
[00:21:00] So the idea is, you know, now we're really talking about AI.
[00:21:04] I was telling this to Tara just before we started
[00:21:07] and I'll make this very quick,
[00:21:08] because this is really about Tara,
[00:21:09] but I found a really cool application for AI this weekend.
[00:21:14] I was, said, I wonder what AI knows about my condo
[00:21:17] and I just put in the building it was built a few years ago
[00:21:19] and it knew everything.
[00:21:21] I just wrote, tell me everything you know about
[00:21:23] and I gave the address and I go, oh my God,
[00:21:25] agents could do this before every single listing they have.
[00:21:29] They just, on their way, you know, use the Bing app,
[00:21:31] talk to it, say, tell me everything, you know,
[00:21:33] and let's say it comes back with nothing.
[00:21:35] Let's say it's like, I don't know anything about this home.
[00:21:37] Okay, fine.
[00:21:38] Then say, give me five fun facts about the neighborhood
[00:21:40] or the city or the suburb or whatever.
[00:21:43] You can use it to get information that, you know,
[00:21:47] or give me things first time home buyers
[00:21:49] in this neighborhood might be curious about
[00:21:51] or, you know, where's the nearest grocery store?
[00:21:53] Things like that.
[00:21:54] You can get really sort of, you can just ask it things
[00:21:56] that you can then use in your conversations.
[00:21:59] Oh, yeah, I love that.
[00:22:00] One of my favorite features of Chad GBT.
[00:22:02] I actually have the paid version
[00:22:04] just because I do a lot of trading on it,
[00:22:05] but with a $20 a month version,
[00:22:08] you get an option to upload a photograph.
[00:22:10] And you can upload a photograph of the listing
[00:22:13] that you're doing, and it will give you,
[00:22:15] yeah, you don't just ask it for a listing description
[00:22:17] for this property that I'm uploading a photograph of.
[00:22:20] And it will give you, give such a great description
[00:22:23] of not only the architecture,
[00:22:24] but it will also go into what is surrounding it
[00:22:27] because there is, I believe, the metadata
[00:22:29] that's attached to the photos.
[00:22:31] Oh, sure, yeah.
[00:22:32] Yeah, yeah.
[00:22:34] So that's really smart.
[00:22:35] So it'll know the coordinates of that,
[00:22:38] most likely, if you have your metadata in there.
[00:22:41] And then it will just look for other information,
[00:22:44] kind of, oh, that's brilliant, I love it.
[00:22:46] Yeah, and I'm sure it takes into consideration
[00:22:48] to other listings that are around the area.
[00:22:51] So kind of like, you know,
[00:22:52] try and gulates all those different things.
[00:22:54] And just really gives you some really juicy stuff.
[00:22:57] So for $20 a month, if I was a brand new agent,
[00:23:00] and I really didn't know much about architecture
[00:23:02] or I hadn't learned that yet,
[00:23:04] I would before every listing just upload one picture
[00:23:07] and say, tell me everything you know
[00:23:08] about this particular photo,
[00:23:10] everything that you can, you know, surmise.
[00:23:13] And this way, guys, when you can talk,
[00:23:15] say, oh, this is a tutor home,
[00:23:16] or whatever it may be.
[00:23:18] So, oh, that's such a great suggestion.
[00:23:20] I love that.
[00:23:21] Mm-hmm.
[00:23:21] Yeah, yeah.
[00:23:22] And it's not just limited to, like, kind of listing
[00:23:25] and everything, like, AI can really help you craft,
[00:23:28] like a really compelling bio.
[00:23:29] It can help you build your brand.
[00:23:32] You know, it can help you draft copy for your website
[00:23:36] for, you know, all of your social media posts
[00:23:39] and everything like that.
[00:23:40] So I use it all the time.
[00:23:42] And, you know, I will say that, yes,
[00:23:44] you definitely have to like book it over.
[00:23:45] But as far as like getting like the creative juices
[00:23:48] kind of flowing and making, you know,
[00:23:51] getting things started on the path to creativity,
[00:23:53] like it is a block remover.
[00:23:56] Like, so use it, it will change your world.
[00:24:02] Yeah, it really will, I think, ultimately,
[00:24:06] over time, there'll be applications developed into it
[00:24:09] that are very assistant focused,
[00:24:11] where you're going to be able, it's going to know you,
[00:24:13] it's going to know your schedule,
[00:24:14] it's going to know, you know, your, you know, your challenges,
[00:24:18] and it's ultimately going to start, you know, helping you.
[00:24:21] But now for now, you can just manually ask it everything.
[00:24:24] And as Tara was saying, you know,
[00:24:26] you can start talking to it and telling it who you are.
[00:24:29] Hey, I'm a REALTOR, I'm this age.
[00:24:32] I have been in the business this long.
[00:24:34] The more specific information you give it,
[00:24:36] the better answer it will give you.
[00:24:38] And I'm looking for first time home buyers in this area.
[00:24:41] You could even ask it, what suggestions do you have
[00:24:44] for me to find first time home buyers in this area?
[00:24:47] It will give you, it will give you all sorts of suggestions.
[00:24:50] Let's talk about, so for,
[00:24:55] I think what most agents know about AI today
[00:24:57] is listing descriptions.
[00:24:59] We know we can throw our listing description that we write
[00:25:02] in, or we don't even, maybe AI will write it for us.
[00:25:04] But if we have one, we can have it write a more persuasive one
[00:25:07] or, you know, and you could even tell it
[00:25:10] to avoid fair housing violations.
[00:25:13] So you can always say, please rewrite this
[00:25:14] in a more persuasive way or more emotional way
[00:25:18] or whatever.
[00:25:19] And please make sure to avoid, you know,
[00:25:21] fair housing violations.
[00:25:23] And it's, again, you want to double check everything,
[00:25:25] but you can add that in at the end.
[00:25:28] Yeah, for sure.
[00:25:29] The other, I mean, it's not limited
[00:25:31] to just listing descriptions or branding even.
[00:25:34] If you are utilizing like a CRM
[00:25:36] and you want to put together some kind of open house campaign
[00:25:41] or texting strategy, you can use it to navigate that as well
[00:25:46] and come up with email templates, texting templates,
[00:25:50] anything like that that you want to add into your CRM.
[00:25:54] In order to nurture your clients.
[00:25:56] So yeah.
[00:25:57] And also, you can use it.
[00:25:59] I know a very popular thing for agents
[00:26:02] is doing webinars or seminars where your, for example,
[00:26:06] hey, I'm gonna help you buy your first home
[00:26:08] or from renting to buying, why you would consider that
[00:26:12] or investing in real estate or whatever the particular topic might be,
[00:26:16] you can have chat GBT write you, not only descriptions
[00:26:21] for every slide.
[00:26:22] They could actually create the slides for you as well.
[00:26:25] So it's really very, very cool.
[00:26:27] If you're like, I'm not good at graphic design,
[00:26:29] I don't use Canva or Photoshop.
[00:26:31] Yes, I mean, you still may have to tweak some things,
[00:26:34] but it can put a pretty decent first draft together for you.
[00:26:37] Yeah, for sure.
[00:26:40] One of the things that have come up recently
[00:26:42] like with the team at my home is putting together
[00:26:46] kind of seller education classes.
[00:26:49] And like, you know, initially those types of things
[00:26:51] they seem like a really big elephant
[00:26:53] just have to swallow right off the bat.
[00:26:56] And so if you start it and do it systematically,
[00:27:00] you can really, you know, and you take it just one step at a time,
[00:27:03] you can develop an entire course to teach on,
[00:27:08] do the presentation, and then also put together a marketing strategy
[00:27:11] to help people bring people into your classes.
[00:27:15] So, you know, it's just, it's very holistic.
[00:27:18] I mean, you can just do the whole thing
[00:27:20] and it makes it very doable for just your average,
[00:27:25] you know, average individual who needs to generate some business
[00:27:30] and make some contacts.
[00:27:32] Yeah, if you, if somebody's, you know,
[00:27:35] if our listeners are thinking, okay,
[00:27:38] I want to create great video content on social media this year,
[00:27:42] but I don't really want to write the scripts
[00:27:45] and I don't, you know, it's hard for me to come up with topics.
[00:27:48] This is what you can use chat GBT to do as well.
[00:27:51] Say, hey, create a 60 second script for me,
[00:27:56] specifically talking about, you know, X, Y or Z
[00:28:00] and then give me five different versions of that
[00:28:02] or five different, you know, five different examples altogether.
[00:28:06] And literally that's your script
[00:28:08] or at least a good first draft for a script
[00:28:10] and you just saved yourself hours
[00:28:11] and now you just have to turn your phone around
[00:28:13] and hit the record button.
[00:28:15] Yes, yes.
[00:28:16] And you know, you have so many resources out there
[00:28:18] as real estate agents with regards to market data
[00:28:21] and you know, everybody wants to do a market update,
[00:28:24] but nobody wants knows what to say
[00:28:25] or sometimes in some cases you may not even know
[00:28:28] how to interpret some of the data that's coming through.
[00:28:30] And so use things like chat GBT or even Claud A.
[00:28:34] I was a really good one for consuming
[00:28:35] a large amounts of data.
[00:28:37] So you can get some like 10 key takeaways
[00:28:40] on like a really hefty document.
[00:28:42] And then you can ask it to generate
[00:28:44] you a script just like he does like did you was saying
[00:28:46] and it will even go into as much detail
[00:28:49] as giving you like the cutscenes
[00:28:50] and what should be incorporated like on screen
[00:28:53] as far as text is concerned.
[00:28:55] So it does.
[00:28:57] It just it saves you so much time
[00:28:58] and leaves you way more time to actually connect with people
[00:29:00] and your families like, I mean,
[00:29:03] this is gonna be like the biggest time saver I think
[00:29:05] and we're really gonna see some leveling up.
[00:29:08] I feel like in the real estate industry, thanks to AI.
[00:29:12] Yeah, you want to be at the front part of the curve here
[00:29:15] because once everybody understands how to utilize it,
[00:29:18] it becomes a little bit less significant
[00:29:20] for the individual agent because everyone's going
[00:29:23] to be utilizing these tools in different ways
[00:29:26] but you really want to be at the front end of this
[00:29:28] because this is the time to really explore AI.
[00:29:32] I would love to also Tara ask you,
[00:29:36] oh, we should mention by the way,
[00:29:37] Tara does consulting and coaching for real estate agents.
[00:29:41] She talks a lot about marketing automation, branding,
[00:29:45] AI systems, this is her specialty.
[00:29:48] She is a marketing guru.
[00:29:49] So if you're interested, we have Tara's contact information
[00:29:53] in the listing description, please, please, please reach out
[00:29:56] to her and she can let you know
[00:29:57] what her different training and coaching options are.
[00:30:00] Tara, let's talk a little bit about batching content
[00:30:04] because we know like in an ideal world,
[00:30:06] I'd film a video every two days
[00:30:08] and maybe a 60 second video on Instagram or Facebook.
[00:30:13] But we know that that's pretty difficult to do
[00:30:16] when things are flying at an agent at any given time
[00:30:20] and maybe every two days isn't realistic.
[00:30:22] So could you batch the content
[00:30:24] and do you recommend sort of batching versus individual
[00:30:28] doing it every two days or so?
[00:30:30] I personally love batching.
[00:30:33] I have tried both ways,
[00:30:37] both doing it on the fly and trying to juggle a million things
[00:30:41] at once, even just like in my regular job,
[00:30:44] I mean, I have other clients and everything
[00:30:46] that I have to work with to just real estate agents.
[00:30:48] And I have to set aside like two to three hours a week
[00:30:53] for planning and recording.
[00:30:58] So I may have a day where I do just kind of like the plan,
[00:31:01] I find my audio, I do kind of all the background
[00:31:04] right out my caption and do my hashtags.
[00:31:07] And then I have another day where it may just be super simple
[00:31:10] and then the recording is just like one and done
[00:31:13] and I'm scheduled and I'm done for the week.
[00:31:16] I love that.
[00:31:17] It makes my week so much less stressful.
[00:31:22] And so if you can do that, I highly suggest it.
[00:31:26] You can use anything from Google Sheets
[00:31:30] to organize kind of your plan for the week
[00:31:33] to tools like Trello or Asana,
[00:31:35] both of those are very easy to use and free.
[00:31:38] Actually, all of those are easy to use and free.
[00:31:41] I personally like Asana.
[00:31:43] I've tried everything else
[00:31:44] and that's the one that kind of works best for me
[00:31:46] and for what I need.
[00:31:49] And it really just takes a lot of the pressure
[00:31:52] off of the posting piece too
[00:31:55] because I mean, how many times have you gotten to a point
[00:31:57] where you're like, oh, I'm gonna do this real.
[00:31:58] And you know, and okay, maybe I don't want to post it
[00:32:03] after all or I'll post it and then you delete it
[00:32:05] because you're like, oh, it was really embarrassing.
[00:32:08] Or I didn't think it was gonna do well.
[00:32:10] If you schedule it and then you just don't think about it
[00:32:12] and you just let it go, you know what I mean?
[00:32:14] And you kind of, you just have to be okay
[00:32:16] with summer gonna flop and summer not.
[00:32:20] And and and batching really helps,
[00:32:23] I think not only with time saving
[00:32:25] but also with like your mindset
[00:32:26] as it pertains to getting content out.
[00:32:30] Yeah, and also too, let's remember everyone
[00:32:32] that just because you post something on social video,
[00:32:35] for example, a very small percentage of your audience
[00:32:38] is actually going to see it.
[00:32:40] So it's not like every single person you know
[00:32:42] is gonna watch this video and then have a judgment
[00:32:44] about it whether it was good or bad, you know,
[00:32:46] it very, very small percentage.
[00:32:48] So don't worry too much about, you know, that part of it
[00:32:51] of like, oh my gosh, this isn't perfect.
[00:32:53] I don't think anyone's expecting perfection
[00:32:57] out of your content.
[00:32:58] I think what they're expecting is good quality information.
[00:33:02] Curious to get your thoughts on that.
[00:33:04] Yeah, no, I have 100% agree.
[00:33:06] And you know, it's important to kind of come up
[00:33:08] with some guidelines for yourself with regards
[00:33:11] to what it is you're gonna be posting
[00:33:12] just to kind of keep your guardrails,
[00:33:14] your bumpers on so to speak,
[00:33:15] so that you don't get too far off and, you know,
[00:33:18] while all land.
[00:33:20] And it also makes it easier to plan that way
[00:33:22] you know, and people want information,
[00:33:26] they want it, like I was saying earlier,
[00:33:27] they want to be entertained, they want to be inspired.
[00:33:30] And so coming up with some common themes for yourself
[00:33:33] that makes sense and resonate with who you are
[00:33:35] and who you want to be as a brand is gonna be
[00:33:37] an important first step even like back
[00:33:39] when we're talking about, you know,
[00:33:41] creating and identifying who your audience is.
[00:33:44] Because you can't please everyone.
[00:33:47] And so it's important that you're talking,
[00:33:50] you know, you have to narrow down who it is you're talking to.
[00:33:53] And not care about who, you know,
[00:33:56] like you're saying, your friends and your sphere,
[00:33:59] yes, they might see you,
[00:34:00] but only a few of them will.
[00:34:03] And you know, the reason that you're doing social media
[00:34:06] and you know, Reels or TikTok or anything like that
[00:34:09] is to reach new followers.
[00:34:11] And so you wanna be speaking to them
[00:34:13] and if you don't raise your hand and be yourself
[00:34:16] and let people know what it is you do,
[00:34:18] then they're not going to find you.
[00:34:20] 
[00:34:20] Now, I have a question about personal,
[00:34:25] revealing personal details about your own life
[00:34:28] versus just professional details, right?
[00:34:31] So we can talk, we can have a brand that is exclusively
[00:34:36] I provide great information about buying and selling homes
[00:34:39] and that real estate stuff.
[00:34:41] And I also know a lot of agents want to show parts
[00:34:45] of their personal life as well that people could find
[00:34:48] maybe interesting because it shows what that agent
[00:34:50] is passionate about.
[00:34:52] For example, you're a workout person across foot person.
[00:34:55] So I've seen agents who are cross-foot people post,
[00:34:58] you know, little quick videos of their workouts.
[00:35:01] Do you have an opinion?
[00:35:03] And again, everybody's temperature around sharing private
[00:35:07] or more personal information is as different.
[00:35:11] So obviously there's no correct answer.
[00:35:13] But what's your overall thought on professional content
[00:35:16] versus personal content?
[00:35:19] I think good mix is always a good idea.
[00:35:23] People, they want to know the person behind the profile.
[00:35:27] And I think how much you share is really your choice
[00:35:30] and dependent on how comfortable you are doing that
[00:35:34] and whether that's something that you feel is important.
[00:35:37] So I mean, I try to be a mix.
[00:35:41] You know, I kind of think of stories as kind of my place
[00:35:43] to engage with the people and share kind of silly names
[00:35:48] about my husband or something like that.
[00:35:51] And then I tend to kind of keep my reels and mix
[00:35:54] of personal, inspirational and business.
[00:35:59] And I think it's important to share who you are
[00:36:03] outside of business because I personally,
[00:36:07] I built a lot of my business around CrossFit
[00:36:09] when I was actively selling
[00:36:12] and had I not done CrossFit
[00:36:14] and not let those people know what it was I did,
[00:36:17] then I probably wouldn't have been as successful as I was.
[00:36:21] So people like to connect with Black people.
[00:36:24] So show who you are and what you do outside of just real estate.
[00:36:29] Did you end up working with CrossFit people
[00:36:31] who would be attracted to,
[00:36:33] hey, she's CrossFit person, I saw her videos.
[00:36:35] So they would start to think, hey, she's like me.
[00:36:38] I want to work with people who are
[00:36:39] into the similar things to me.
[00:36:41] Like I imagine you probably did work with CrossFit people.
[00:36:43] I did, yeah, a lot.
[00:36:46] Yeah, it's funny.
[00:36:48] I used to, when I used to see REALTORS showing their workouts,
[00:36:52] I always, I was like, I don't really get it.
[00:36:54] Like do people really care?
[00:36:56] And then I sort of like watching people work out now.
[00:36:59] Like I don't know why even if it's just for a few seconds,
[00:37:01] there's something kind of inspiring about it for me to remind me
[00:37:04] to continue on my physical health journey.
[00:37:07] But also it's like, oh, that person's really disciplined.
[00:37:11] It also, and I'm not saying everyone has to work out
[00:37:13] and fund their workout videos.
[00:37:14] But whatever it is you're passionate about any part of your life,
[00:37:17] you can feature it.
[00:37:19] And again, that might just speak to somebody who also has those
[00:37:22] same passions and is like, God, I wish I had a REALTOR that was
[00:37:26] into some of the same stuff that I'm into.
[00:37:28] Or I'd be more comfortable with a REALTOR who is into some of these,
[00:37:31] you know, I'm a, if you were like a big Harry Potter fan, I'm not.
[00:37:34] But if you were, I would be talking about, I mean, that's an old thing.
[00:37:37] But whatever, whatever a newer version of Harry Potter, that's your thing.
[00:37:41] I would, I would talk about it all the time on social media if that was your
[00:37:44] thing because you're going to attract those people who have that same passion.
[00:37:49] 100%.
[00:37:49] Do you have a, do you have a suggestion for a mix of personal to professional?
[00:37:53] So in other words, hey, here's some information about buying and selling homes
[00:37:57] or I just bought, you know, I just had a client do this or that.
[00:38:00] And here's what I got going on in my personal life.
[00:38:02] Do you have like a suggestion for a mix of maybe what percentage should be each?
[00:38:07] Yeah, I personally think that it's like, you know, two thirds, you and one third
[00:38:13] business, especially for real estate agents, you know, and it's, it's more like
[00:38:18] who you are with a sprinkle of real estate kind of in there.
[00:38:21] And if you can relate what you do on a daily basis, like maybe you're at the park
[00:38:26] working and you're like, hey, getting work done while I'm, you know, watching my
[00:38:29] kid throw, throw a baseball or something like that.
[00:38:32] So, you know, there's subtle ways for you to do it on a consistent basis.
[00:38:36] It's just kind of figuring it out and making, you know, you have to just do it.
[00:38:41] It's really the strategy.
[00:38:44] You have to just figure it out what's going to work for you and, you know,
[00:38:49] make sure that you're paying attention to the analytics and the data that's within
[00:38:54] the system.
[00:38:54] So you can kind of see what's getting, you know, the most engagement, maybe what's
[00:38:58] not. So you can shape your content that way.
[00:39:01] Can we, can we talk a little bit about digital advertising and, and beyond like
[00:39:06] we're talking about creating content?
[00:39:08] Do you have specific thoughts on agents who are thinking about doing Facebook ads
[00:39:13] or LinkedIn ads or Instagram ads?
[00:39:17] Any specific, have you seen agents have success with that or is that, is that a
[00:39:21] tough mountain to climb?
[00:39:23] Just curious your thoughts.
[00:39:25] Yeah. So, you know, Facebook ads, bulk of the population is on Facebook.
[00:39:30] I mean, it's got the biggest audience out there.
[00:39:32] And so if you are just going in and boosting posts, posts like randomly,
[00:39:37] like you don't have any strategy behind who it is, you're trying to target.
[00:39:40] I think you're pretty much like throwing spaghetti at the wall, just kind of
[00:39:43] see in what, what, what sticks.
[00:39:45] There's, there are ways to be much more strategic about your ads that you're
[00:39:50] doing on Facebook, Instagram.
[00:39:53] And, you know, and I'll talk about like, did it a second, but with regards to
[00:39:56] Facebook and Instagram, there's a lot of ways to kind of layer your farming.
[00:40:00] So if you are farming specific areas, you can layer some digital ads on top of
[00:40:06] that. So utilizing phone numbers and email addresses that you may have from
[00:40:09] your farms, you can create customer audiences and target them in more than one
[00:40:13] way. So you may be sending them a postcard in the mail.
[00:40:16] So they're getting that.
[00:40:17] And then they're also starting to see you online.
[00:40:19] So they're like, oh my gosh, this person is everywhere.
[00:40:22] I think that that's probably the most strategic way to do any kind of Facebook
[00:40:26] or Instagram ads at this point, especially for real estate.
[00:40:30] It's just being, you know, strategic, you could even, you know, download your,
[00:40:34] your contacts from the cloud and Google and, you know, so that way you have
[00:40:38] like your spirit and some people that maybe, maybe, maybe you worked within the
[00:40:42] past that you may not have contact with anymore.
[00:40:45] So there's a lot of ways to do them.
[00:40:47] That's a really good point too.
[00:40:49] So basically what Tara was saying is you can take your CRM and, and export
[00:40:53] all of your contacts and upload those into Facebook as a custom audience.
[00:40:58] And what Facebook's going to do is try to match those email addresses and the
[00:41:02] names with accounts that they have.
[00:41:04] And it isn't going to be a perfect match always and it might not find everybody.
[00:41:08] But it's going to find a lot of people.
[00:41:10] And if you upload all your clients, for example, you probably wouldn't want
[00:41:14] them to receive an ad that says, Hey, buy your, buy your first home, right?
[00:41:18] Assuming that these are people that have already bought a home, right?
[00:41:20] They might want to get a thing about are you looking to upgrade to your next
[00:41:23] property? You could make a specific ad for that or looking to make a change.
[00:41:27] That kind of thing.
[00:41:29] So you can get really granular about this and there doesn't have to be a
[00:41:32] million different buckets.
[00:41:33] But there may be a few buckets of, you know, this isn't yet a client.
[00:41:37] This is a client that I've already worked with.
[00:41:39] And you can have different ads going in this way.
[00:41:42] And guys, I used to Facebook used to come on my show every single month,
[00:41:46] corporate and talk about it.
[00:41:47] And they would say, do not boost post.
[00:41:49] Do not boost post if you're a REALTOR.
[00:41:50] They would literally just tell us to do it.
[00:41:52] It goes back a few years, but the head of the real estate department and
[00:41:56] Instagram or at a Facebook would bet I would say do not boost posts.
[00:41:59] Guys, you want to be way more strategic.
[00:42:02] And so Tara can actually help you with all of this stuff too and help you figure
[00:42:05] out what your audiences are.
[00:42:07] It is a little complicated, but she can help you get, get set up that way.
[00:42:12] Yeah, 100%.
[00:42:13] And with regards to LinkedIn, so LinkedIn is actually has been named like one
[00:42:18] of the top things to do for 2024 as far as ads are concerned.
[00:42:24] You know, there's a lot of opportunities there, particularly with people
[00:42:28] who are doing like commercial and agricultural things that are more business
[00:42:33] to business, but also on the luxury market.
[00:42:36] Like there's a lot of cat co-cats you can make.
[00:42:37] You can do some targeting with regards to job title things like that to kind
[00:42:43] of make your targeting a little bit more specific and segmented.
[00:42:49] And, you know, I personally have not run any ads on LinkedIn.
[00:42:54] This has just kind of done my research, so I'm excited to dive into it on my own
[00:42:58] and see what I could do.
[00:43:00] Some of my colleagues have been working on it and they've been just, you know,
[00:43:04] singing its phrases.
[00:43:05] So if you have not taken an opportunity to check out LinkedIn for your marketing efforts
[00:43:12] in 2024, that's definitely something to start keep an eye on.
[00:43:16] And it's also the social media platform that I think REALTORS use the very least.
[00:43:22] It seems to be not used at all by REALTORS and it is used by literally every other industry.
[00:43:26] So this is a place where I would spend a lot of time.
[00:43:29] For example, if you had a client that worked at a corporation in your local area,
[00:43:34] I would go into LinkedIn and see if I could find like the head of HR for that particular
[00:43:39] organization, if it's big enough to have that, or the owner and say, hey, I just worked
[00:43:43] with one of your employees.
[00:43:45] I helped them, you know, buy, sell or whatever.
[00:43:47] And I would love the opportunity to come and bring lunch for the audience, for the office
[00:43:52] and, you know, reach out and do a free webinar about, you know, working with a REALTOR, whatever.
[00:43:58] This is what you can use LinkedIn to do is you can actually find this information
[00:44:02] and use it in a hyper local way.
[00:44:04] So it's not just about making as many connections as you can on LinkedIn, which is great as well,
[00:44:09] or posting great content to LinkedIn, but you can actually use it for research and development
[00:44:12] to find opportunities for you to reach out to, you know, because every, every corporate person I know,
[00:44:19] they use LinkedIn.
[00:44:20] They love LinkedIn.
[00:44:21] They use it.
[00:44:22] REALTORS don't usually use it.
[00:44:23] So don't be, don't be fooled into thinking, oh, no one uses LinkedIn.
[00:44:26] They do.
[00:44:27] It's just REALTOR.
[00:44:28] Yeah, exactly.
[00:44:30] Yeah, I've used it more in the last like four years that I ever thought I would.
[00:44:36] But it's amazing.
[00:44:37] Like a number of connections that you can make on that platform.
[00:44:41] You know, it's great to just stay up to date on a lot of different market trends,
[00:44:46] because that's where it's a great place for you to also share your insights as far as like what you know about the market.
[00:44:52] So just be strategic about what you're sharing there.
[00:44:55] And, and I, and you join groups.
[00:44:57] There's, there's all kinds of things on there for you to participate in and engage.
[00:45:01] So yeah, I'm a big fan.
[00:45:03] We're actually streaming live to LinkedIn right now as well.
[00:45:06] So we stream the, yeah, we streamed to all the major platforms.
[00:45:11] And, and that's guys, you know, that's kind of what you, you want to, again, the whole point is,
[00:45:16] should I be on Facebook?
[00:45:17] Should I be on Instagram?
[00:45:18] Should I be on LinkedIn TikTok?
[00:45:20] Where is your audience hanging out?
[00:45:22] That's where you want to be.
[00:45:23] We're at, and also what you enjoy.
[00:45:25] Like if you hate LinkedIn, don't, don't do it then.
[00:45:27] If you hate TikTok, don't be on TikTok because it's, it's not going to work for you as well.
[00:45:31] You want to be on something that you feel comfortable with, but also that your audience, your, your, your,
[00:45:37] preferred audience is hanging out at.
[00:45:39] How do you know where your preferred audience hangs out?
[00:45:41] Ask them, send out a survey to all of your clients and say, Hey, I'm working on my marketing strategy for next year.
[00:45:46] Just curious, where do you spend the most time?
[00:45:49] Well, you know, what, what social media channels, if, if any, do you spend time on that will tell you we found out in an organization that I,
[00:45:55] that I help that unrelated real estate that LinkedIn was the number one place I would have never guessed that I would have guessed Facebook.
[00:46:04] But for this organization with thousands of members, LinkedIn was the clear winner and we wouldn't have known that had we not asked.
[00:46:10] So we put a lot of our resources in a LinkedIn at that point.
[00:46:13] So great suggestion there is just reach out to your audience and say, Hey, can you help me?
[00:46:17] I'm curious on where you're spending a lot of time.
[00:46:20] And that'll give you some guidance.
[00:46:22] So Tara Meyer is our guest and I want to make sure that we tell everybody that she is a coach.
[00:46:29] She can, she is a digital strategist.
[00:46:31] She is also a marketing strategist and more, most recently, AI and she's a systems person.
[00:46:36] So for example, if you wanted to learn how to deal with transaction management and maybe not have to do all of that, all that work,
[00:46:44] she can help you figure that stuff out as well.
[00:46:46] She's a systems person and she's very, very effective.
[00:46:48] So if anyone out there is like, gosh, I would like to work with someone like Tara.
[00:46:52] Maybe she can help, you know, take my my marketing strategies or my systems to the next level or just learn more about AI and automation.
[00:47:00] Tara is your person.

[00:47:29] So guys, if you miss some of them, please go back and relisten and the best way you can help us is just tell a friend about the show.
[00:47:36] Tell another REALTOR that's struggling with, I mean, everyone's struggling right now, guys.
[00:47:40] It's just a tough time to be in real estate.
[00:47:42] So everybody needs as much help as possible.
[00:47:44] Do do a good deed.

We have to learn about all things Tara. Tara, welcome to the show. Thank you. Thanks for having me. I have to say, my very first real girlfriend in life was named Tara. And so, and I haven't thought of that name in a very, very long time. So I'm having these weird flashbacks to my early 20s of going, this painful relationship that was a million years ago. And actually, she's old. She's a lovely person. Everybody's first relationship was terrible, I think. So, but it is funny. I haven't talked to too many Tara since then. And I had a moment where I was like, why am I thinking about my, oh, that's right. They have the same name. So, I knew I was just kind of a cute story. But she's married, has kids. She's doing great. But anyway, let's talk about some fun stuff today because I'm a marketing person as well. You're a marketing person. You're about systems and branding and marketing. And we're going to talk about all that fun stuff. As opposed to just how do you grow your business? Which is what I do on every other episode, which is really fun and exciting too. But people really want to hear about systems and marketing. So, let's talk about that. But before we do, I do want to find out how you got into the business. How did you start in real estate and why? Yeah. So, in 2002, I found myself at the front desk of a title insurance company. I spent 10 years at first American title, kind of doing various positions. I grew from, like I said, a receptionist. I did Escort of Spursments and signings and finished off as an examiner on the title side. Shortly after that, I was recruited by an agent who liked my title background. He was focused primarily in RIO at that time. So, that was around 2010. And I helped him with, I mean, he was a one-man show running like 30, various 30 to 50 RIO dispositions at one time. So, it was all things vendor management and cash for keys and some of those, not so sexy things. And then from there, I transitioned, I got my license in Arizona 2012. I was a successful agent. I think I did roughly around 150 transactions between 2012 to 2019 when I also got my broker's license. And then I quickly decided, I decided I wanted to pivot and do something new. And so I went into Prop Deck. That where I was a supervisor and a program manager for Zillow offers. And I learned all things scaling and how to operate with well-managed people as well as work with some of the most top producing agents in the Western United States that were affiliated with Zillow offers at that time. Sure. They unfortunately went through a line down, which everybody knows about. I didn't get it. We all know Zillow offers is no more. By the way, I know a lot of people have strong feelings about Zillow in general. I do not have those same strong feelings. I am a big fan of tech companies. Zillow, will they ultimately try to replace agents? I guess they say they won't. But regardless, I think Zillow really does act to really help agents more than, and I know that not everyone agrees with that. But I am a fan of Zillow. Actually, they used to be a sponsor of my show and I face to have them on the show all the time. So I'm a big fan. Yeah, it was a great company to work for. I learned a lot about culture and just how to operate in a high capacity. So I really valued my time there and some fortunate that it ended, but things happen for a reason. It was just bad timing, not you, but it was just timing with the market and everything. And it wasn't the only company like that or division of a company like that to go under pretty much most of them did. So it wasn't exclusive to Zillow. But so you pivoted, you were doing that and then that ended and then where'd you go from there? Yeah, so then I was picked up by another Proptech company, actually called it Workshored and I was the general manager and launched the Phoenix market here. And they also went through a wind down. So it was there for about a year and a half. So my 10 year in Proptech lasted about four years. And then I was like, okay, I need to do something different. Maybe I just need to go back into real estate. And so I was kind of playing with that and trying to relaunch my indie career at the worst time, probably possible. And while we were kind of going through with these high interest rates and everything of 2022 and 2023, and then I was actually approached by or I followed a friend of mine, Aaron Lyce, who's also an MTD for my home. And he had kind of sent out in SOS. I'm looking for somebody who's really into marketing and can help me kind of grow what I'm doing here. And so I reached out to him and was like, wow, this sounds really fun. And I don't know if I have the chops for it, but I'm willing to give it a try. And it just made sense because it was like, even throughout my entire real estate career, that was the thing that I focused on the most was the marketing technology piece. I was in charge of doing the websites. I was in charge of doing all of the lead gen of setting up our online presence of doing all of these things. And so I have a knack for it and a passion for helping others. And I'm also, this kind of side hustle, but I'm also a CrossFit coach. And so I love helping people just lifting them up and helping them navigate complex things, whether that's how to do a snatch or a clean and jerk or navigating how to figure out how to put together a Facebook post. So I have one CrossFit question for you. I don't know that this is a CrossFit move necessarily, but in fact, it's funny. I was telling Tara, I go, I have to leave it to a clock. And the reason I have to leave is I have a personal training session, not CrossFit, but I do like a weightlifter workout. But when I was gonna ask you, because I've only seen CrossFit people do this. And for everyone else who's listening, like, shut up, get to the real estate stuff. But I just wanna ask one quick question. Is, can you do a muscle up? Is that a, do you know what a muscle up is? Those are insane. You can do one? Oh yeah, I can do them on the rings and I can do them on the bar. So either one. So I want everybody to know what Tara just said means she is the strongest person to have ever been on this podcast. Because she will tell you, it is one of the hardest things you can possibly do as an exercise. And literally I've had on NFL football players on the show that cannot do that. So that is incredible. So you are a very fit person. That is incredible. Oh, if I had athlete, yes. Yes. Oh my gosh, that is amazing. And guys, if you don't know what that is, Google muscle up. It doesn't look as hard. Just give it a try. And if you could even, anyway, all right, let's get to the fun stuff. But the reason I'm saying this is my trainer just got her, did her first muscle up ever, it took her a year to get there. And she's like the strongest person I know. So that's really, really impressive. So discipline is not a problem for you. Is what I'm guessing. No, it is not a problem. I love trying to figure things out, whether it be a muscle up or walking down my hands or how to get somebody to look at my website. Let's start with online presence. So REALTORS, I agree. Most of them have little to no online presence with the exception of, hey, I just sold this home or I just listed this property and I'm gonna throw a pretty boring post on Facebook or Instagram. That's usually about it. Let's talk about what agents can do in 2024 to really provide value to their followers on social media because, and I wanna get your opinion on this, I believe the best way to really garner interest is to provide some sort of content that isn't all just about, look at how great I am, but more about here's some maybe questions or some answers to questions that you, Mr. and Mrs. Follower, might have or here's some content that you just would find interesting. So I'd love to get your overall philosophy on online branding, especially with social media. Oh gosh, yeah. So so much to talk about there. So first and foremost, am I, online presence is probably the most important thing that a real estate agent can do. I mean, 90% of people are going online and Googling you, whether you are a referral or whether they see a postcard coming the mail, they're gonna be Googling you, they're gonna be checking out who you are, what you stand for, what your online marketing looks like before they decide to pick up a phone and call you. And so, also your friends are going to do the same thing. So don't assume that just because you work a referral based business, meaning your clients refer or it's your sphere of influence, those people are also going to search you. Yeah, and that's, you know, a common misconception right now is that referrals will just pick up the phone and call and that was maybe true five years ago. Now, on average, it's taking them two to three weeks of research before they actually decide to pick up the phone and call. So, online presence number one is showing up consistently so that it's not confusing, you know, all of these online platforms like zelo.com, redspin, Realtor.com, homes.com, they're all going to create profiles for you, whether you like it or not, because they are fed from the IDX feeds. And so it's important that you go in and you take control of what people see from you. And so that means updating, adding a profile photo, if there's an opportunity to showcase a banner like in Realtor.com, you should do that. Make sure your bio is up to date and accurate, not outdated, and also ensuring that all of your links work to your various platforms. Google Business is one that's, you know, I think way under leverage right now for real estate agents. And it's so important because you can drive all of your reviews there and it's the first thing people see when they Google your name. And there's a lot of ways to optimize it for hyper local type content. And when you talk about content, you know, whether you're posting it on social media. So if you're into doing Facebook, YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, all of those, I think it's great. I personally don't think that you need to be an influencer on any of those platforms in order to have a successful business. But what I do think you need to do is you need to show. If you decide to show up on one of those, you need to be present and you need to engage on a consistent basis. So, you know, we look at different platforms like they are going to give you kind of either a positive result, a neutral result or a negative one. And profiles that you have kind of out there, like maybe you have a Twitter or none on his ex platform that you've had for five years and you don't do anything on it. It almost kind of gives that like negative, wow, is she open? Get rid of it. Yeah, get rid of it if you're not using it because nobody likes to see last post 2018. You're like, well, it just appears that you've abandoned something, right? Totally, totally. And, you know, there are certain things that are good about having some of those platforms. But like I said, if you're not on there, consistently using it, posting consistently, then get off of it. And then with regards to content, I'm with you. Like I think that, you know, gone are the days when just posting at house for sale is going to be exciting. I mean, I'm to the point I don't know about you, but if I see it, I just scroll right by. And now people want to, they want to be entertained, they want to be informed, they want to be inspired. And so you really kind of have to identify your audience. Number one, that's probably when you venture into this content producing realm, as you need to identify who your audience is going to be. And that includes like uncovering like, what are their consistent struggles? What are their problems? What do they want to know? What are they asking online? And there's a ton of different resources for you out there to kind of figure that out. Like Chatchy BT is a great resource. You can use it to help you identify your audience in your niche, or if you have a niche, like what are some of those, you know, common questions that you can maybe answer on some of your posts. And so, so identify your audience. That's probably like the biggest thing, yeah. Yeah, so I just jumping in just because you said a lot of really great stuff there. So here's what guys, if you're like, well, I sort of don't know my audience, what my target audience is. Well, think about if you've worked with clients in the past, who did you enjoy working with the most? Was it a certain demographic? Maybe an age range, maybe a certain type of buyer or seller first time versus maybe the investor or whatever you enjoyed, you know, and you can literally then type that into Chatchy for if you wanted to work with first time home buyers, for example, and I would want to know what's the average age of a first time home buyer? Okay, well, that you can ask Chatchy BT that. And then I would say, hey, Chatchy BT, what are, give me 10 common concerns that a first time home buyer has or hear 20 questions that a first time home buyer may have or what might a first time home buyer be searching for on Google or Facebook or Instagram or YouTube? You can literally just ask these questions to Chatchy BT and it won't always be perfect answers, but you will get a lot of good data that way. A ton of good data. And I would say, don't be afraid to reiterate your question, the original question that you asked because so many people I hear, you know, like, yeah, I answered a couple of questions and it kind of came back with gibberish. Like you have to, there's a science in an art to the prompt. You have to tell it who you are. So on a real estate agent in this specific area, I want to know what, you know, what home buyers, first time home buyers are struggling with in the FedEx area. So and then give me 10 ideas for content to use on social media. So you have to be very specific. Otherwise, it will, you know, go off and who knows what kind of direction. Yeah, but it is really cool too because if you think like, okay, if one of the questions comes back with Chatchy BT saying, hey, neighborhood selection or suburb selection is one of the biggest challenges for new first time home buyers. Like, oh, that makes sense. Well, guess what guys? You can now create content going, here's how people choose neighborhoods or here's, or here's let's do a tour of a neighborhood. You know, the content is really endless. What you really want to find is how, what really all you're doing is answering the questions first time home buyers or whatever your demographic is has. And I love that when it gives you the 10 ideas and then you say, okay, I want to elaborate on number one and then it'll give you like 10 more ideas or you can break it up into like a script for YouTube. You know, you can just continue to get more and more granular as you go down the chat until you get like, you know, get to the gold, I guess. And for anyone who's looking for the free version of Chatchy BT, yes, you can Google it and find it. I personally, if you're not going to pay for it, you don't probably have to at this point. Down the road, yeah, there's going to be some additional functionality you want to have access to. But I personally, I never search on Bing, but Bing Microsoft owns Chatchy BT. So inside of the Bing app, they have, the Chatchy BT is in there and it's pretty well updated, I think to 2022. So it's pretty current with information and you can literally just speak to it. So if you don't have the Bing app, download it just to use it for Chatchy BT. That's a little my pro tip. Sorry, Tara, go right ahead. Awesome, no, I love it. I love it. I think that I was at the end of my, did I answer all of your questions? I think so, yeah. So the idea is, you know, now we're really talking about AI. I was telling this to Tara just before we started and I'll make this very quick, because this is really about Tara, but I found a really cool application for AI this weekend. I was, said, I wonder what AI knows about my condo and I just put in the building it was built a few years ago and it knew everything. I just wrote, tell me everything you know about and I gave the address and I go, oh my God, agents could do this before every single listing they have. They just, on their way, you know, use the Bing app, talk to it, say, tell me everything, you know, and let's say it comes back with nothing. Let's say it's like, I don't know anything about this home. Okay, fine. Then say, give me five fun facts about the neighborhood or the city or the suburb or whatever. You can use it to get information that, you know, or give me things first time home buyers in this neighborhood might be curious about or, you know, where's the nearest grocery store? Things like that. You can get really sort of, you can just ask it things that you can then use in your conversations. Oh, yeah, I love that. One of my favorite features of Chad GBT. I actually have the paid version just because I do a lot of trading on it, but with a $20 a month version, you get an option to upload a photograph. And you can upload a photograph of the listing that you're doing, and it will give you, yeah, you don't just ask it for a listing description for this property that I'm uploading a photograph of. And it will give you, give such a great description of not only the architecture, but it will also go into what is surrounding it because there is, I believe, the metadata that's attached to the photos. Oh, sure, yeah. Yeah, yeah. So that's really smart. So it'll know the coordinates of that, most likely, if you have your metadata in there. And then it will just look for other information, kind of, oh, that's brilliant, I love it. Yeah, and I'm sure it takes into consideration to other listings that are around the area. So kind of like, you know, try and gulates all those different things. And just really gives you some really juicy stuff. So for $20 a month, if I was a brand new agent, and I really didn't know much about architecture or I hadn't learned that yet, I would before every listing just upload one picture and say, tell me everything you know about this particular photo, everything that you can, you know, surmise. And this way, guys, when you can talk, say, oh, this is a tutor home, or whatever it may be. So, oh, that's such a great suggestion. I love that. Mm-hmm. Yeah, yeah. And it's not just limited to, like, kind of listing and everything, like, AI can really help you craft, like a really compelling bio. It can help you build your brand. You know, it can help you draft copy for your website for, you know, all of your social media posts and everything like that. So I use it all the time. And, you know, I will say that, yes, you definitely have to like book it over. But as far as like getting like the creative juices kind of flowing and making, you know, getting things started on the path to creativity, like it is a block remover. Like, so use it, it will change your world. Yeah, it really will, I think, ultimately, over time, there'll be applications developed into it that are very assistant focused, where you're going to be able, it's going to know you, it's going to know your schedule, it's going to know, you know, your, you know, your challenges, and it's ultimately going to start, you know, helping you. But now for now, you can just manually ask it everything. And as Tara was saying, you know, you can start talking to it and telling it who you are. Hey, I'm a REALTOR, I'm this age. I have been in the business this long. The more specific information you give it, the better answer it will give you. And I'm looking for first time home buyers in this area. You could even ask it, what suggestions do you have for me to find first time home buyers in this area? It will give you, it will give you all sorts of suggestions. Let's talk about, so for, I think what most agents know about AI today is listing descriptions. We know we can throw our listing description that we write in, or we don't even, maybe AI will write it for us. But if we have one, we can have it write a more persuasive one or, you know, and you could even tell it to avoid fair housing violations. So you can always say, please rewrite this in a more persuasive way or more emotional way or whatever. And please make sure to avoid, you know, fair housing violations. And it's, again, you want to double check everything, but you can add that in at the end. Yeah, for sure. The other, I mean, it's not limited to just listing descriptions or branding even. If you are utilizing like a CRM and you want to put together some kind of open house campaign or texting strategy, you can use it to navigate that as well and come up with email templates, texting templates, anything like that that you want to add into your CRM. In order to nurture your clients. So yeah. And also, you can use it. I know a very popular thing for agents is doing webinars or seminars where your, for example, hey, I'm gonna help you buy your first home or from renting to buying, why you would consider that or investing in real estate or whatever the particular topic might be, you can have chat GBT write you, not only descriptions for every slide. They could actually create the slides for you as well. So it's really very, very cool. If you're like, I'm not good at graphic design, I don't use Canva or Photoshop. Yes, I mean, you still may have to tweak some things, but it can put a pretty decent first draft together for you. Yeah, for sure. One of the things that have come up recently like with the team at my home is putting together kind of seller education classes. And like, you know, initially those types of things they seem like a really big elephant just have to swallow right off the bat. And so if you start it and do it systematically, you can really, you know, and you take it just one step at a time, you can develop an entire course to teach on, do the presentation, and then also put together a marketing strategy to help people bring people into your classes. So, you know, it's just, it's very holistic. I mean, you can just do the whole thing and it makes it very doable for just your average, you know, average individual who needs to generate some business and make some contacts. Yeah, if you, if somebody's, you know, if our listeners are thinking, okay, I want to create great video content on social media this year, but I don't really want to write the scripts and I don't, you know, it's hard for me to come up with topics. This is what you can use chat GBT to do as well. Say, hey, create a 60 second script for me, specifically talking about, you know, X, Y or Z and then give me five different versions of that or five different, you know, five different examples altogether. And literally that's your script or at least a good first draft for a script and you just saved yourself hours and now you just have to turn your phone around and hit the record button. Yes, yes. And you know, you have so many resources out there as real estate agents with regards to market data and you know, everybody wants to do a market update, but nobody wants knows what to say or sometimes in some cases you may not even know how to interpret some of the data that's coming through. And so use things like chat GBT or even Claud A. I was a really good one for consuming a large amounts of data. So you can get some like 10 key takeaways on like a really hefty document. And then you can ask it to generate you a script just like he does like did you was saying and it will even go into as much detail as giving you like the cutscenes and what should be incorporated like on screen as far as text is concerned. So it does. It just it saves you so much time and leaves you way more time to actually connect with people and your families like, I mean, this is gonna be like the biggest time saver I think and we're really gonna see some leveling up. I feel like in the real estate industry, thanks to AI. Yeah, you want to be at the front part of the curve here because once everybody understands how to utilize it, it becomes a little bit less significant for the individual agent because everyone's going to be utilizing these tools in different ways but you really want to be at the front end of this because this is the time to really explore AI. I would love to also Tara ask you, oh, we should mention by the way, Tara does consulting and coaching for real estate agents. She talks a lot about marketing automation, branding, AI systems, this is her specialty. She is a marketing guru. So if you're interested, we have Tara's contact information in the listing description, please, please, please reach out to her and she can let you know what her different training and coaching options are. Tara, let's talk a little bit about batching content because we know like in an ideal world, I'd film a video every two days and maybe a 60 second video on Instagram or Facebook. But we know that that's pretty difficult to do when things are flying at an agent at any given time and maybe every two days isn't realistic. So could you batch the content and do you recommend sort of batching versus individual doing it every two days or so? I personally love batching. I have tried both ways, both doing it on the fly and trying to juggle a million things at once, even just like in my regular job, I mean, I have other clients and everything that I have to work with to just real estate agents. And I have to set aside like two to three hours a week for planning and recording. So I may have a day where I do just kind of like the plan, I find my audio, I do kind of all the background right out my caption and do my hashtags. And then I have another day where it may just be super simple and then the recording is just like one and done and I'm scheduled and I'm done for the week. I love that. It makes my week so much less stressful. And so if you can do that, I highly suggest it. You can use anything from Google Sheets to organize kind of your plan for the week to tools like Trello or Asana, both of those are very easy to use and free. Actually, all of those are easy to use and free. I personally like Asana. I've tried everything else and that's the one that kind of works best for me and for what I need. And it really just takes a lot of the pressure off of the posting piece too because I mean, how many times have you gotten to a point where you're like, oh, I'm gonna do this real. And you know, and okay, maybe I don't want to post it after all or I'll post it and then you delete it because you're like, oh, it was really embarrassing. Or I didn't think it was gonna do well. If you schedule it and then you just don't think about it and you just let it go, you know what I mean? And you kind of, you just have to be okay with summer gonna flop and summer not. And and and batching really helps, I think not only with time saving but also with like your mindset as it pertains to getting content out. Yeah, and also too, let's remember everyone that just because you post something on social video, for example, a very small percentage of your audience is actually going to see it. So it's not like every single person you know is gonna watch this video and then have a judgment about it whether it was good or bad, you know, it very, very small percentage. So don't worry too much about, you know, that part of it of like, oh my gosh, this isn't perfect. I don't think anyone's expecting perfection out of your content. I think what they're expecting is good quality information. Curious to get your thoughts on that. Yeah, no, I have 100% agree. And you know, it's important to kind of come up with some guidelines for yourself with regards to what it is you're gonna be posting just to kind of keep your guardrails, your bumpers on so to speak, so that you don't get too far off and, you know, while all land. And it also makes it easier to plan that way you know, and people want information, they want it, like I was saying earlier, they want to be entertained, they want to be inspired. And so coming up with some common themes for yourself that makes sense and resonate with who you are and who you want to be as a brand is gonna be an important first step even like back when we're talking about, you know, creating and identifying who your audience is. Because you can't please everyone. And so it's important that you're talking, you know, you have to narrow down who it is you're talking to. And not care about who, you know, like you're saying, your friends and your sphere, yes, they might see you, but only a few of them will. And you know, the reason that you're doing social media and you know, Reels or TikTok or anything like that is to reach new followers. And so you wanna be speaking to them and if you don't raise your hand and be yourself and let people know what it is you do, then they're not going to find you. Now, I have a question about personal, revealing personal details about your own life versus just professional details, right? So we can talk, we can have a brand that is exclusively I provide great information about buying and selling homes and that real estate stuff. And I also know a lot of agents want to show parts of their personal life as well that people could find maybe interesting because it shows what that agent is passionate about. For example, you're a workout person across foot person. So I've seen agents who are cross-foot people post, you know, little quick videos of their workouts. Do you have an opinion? And again, everybody's temperature around sharing private or more personal information is as different. So obviously there's no correct answer. But what's your overall thought on professional content versus personal content? I think good mix is always a good idea. People, they want to know the person behind the profile. And I think how much you share is really your choice and dependent on how comfortable you are doing that and whether that's something that you feel is important. So I mean, I try to be a mix. You know, I kind of think of stories as kind of my place to engage with the people and share kind of silly names about my husband or something like that. And then I tend to kind of keep my reels and mix of personal, inspirational and business. And I think it's important to share who you are outside of business because I personally, I built a lot of my business around CrossFit when I was actively selling and had I not done CrossFit and not let those people know what it was I did, then I probably wouldn't have been as successful as I was. So people like to connect with Black people. So show who you are and what you do outside of just real estate. Did you end up working with CrossFit people who would be attracted to, hey, she's CrossFit person, I saw her videos. So they would start to think, hey, she's like me. I want to work with people who are into the similar things to me. Like I imagine you probably did work with CrossFit people. I did, yeah, a lot. Yeah, it's funny. I used to, when I used to see REALTORS showing their workouts, I always, I was like, I don't really get it. Like do people really care? And then I sort of like watching people work out now. Like I don't know why even if it's just for a few seconds, there's something kind of inspiring about it for me to remind me to continue on my physical health journey. But also it's like, oh, that person's really disciplined. It also, and I'm not saying everyone has to work out and fund their workout videos. But whatever it is you're passionate about any part of your life, you can feature it. And again, that might just speak to somebody who also has those same passions and is like, God, I wish I had a REALTOR that was into some of the same stuff that I'm into. Or I'd be more comfortable with a REALTOR who is into some of these, you know, I'm a, if you were like a big Harry Potter fan, I'm not. But if you were, I would be talking about, I mean, that's an old thing. But whatever, whatever a newer version of Harry Potter, that's your thing. I would, I would talk about it all the time on social media if that was your thing because you're going to attract those people who have that same passion. 100%. Do you have a, do you have a suggestion for a mix of personal to professional? So in other words, hey, here's some information about buying and selling homes or I just bought, you know, I just had a client do this or that. And here's what I got going on in my personal life. Do you have like a suggestion for a mix of maybe what percentage should be each? Yeah, I personally think that it's like, you know, two thirds, you and one third business, especially for real estate agents, you know, and it's, it's more like who you are with a sprinkle of real estate kind of in there. And if you can relate what you do on a daily basis, like maybe you're at the park working and you're like, hey, getting work done while I'm, you know, watching my kid throw, throw a baseball or something like that. So, you know, there's subtle ways for you to do it on a consistent basis. It's just kind of figuring it out and making, you know, you have to just do it. It's really the strategy. You have to just figure it out what's going to work for you and, you know, make sure that you're paying attention to the analytics and the data that's within the system. So you can kind of see what's getting, you know, the most engagement, maybe what's not. So you can shape your content that way. Can we, can we talk a little bit about digital advertising and, and beyond like we're talking about creating content? Do you have specific thoughts on agents who are thinking about doing Facebook ads or LinkedIn ads or Instagram ads? Any specific, have you seen agents have success with that or is that, is that a tough mountain to climb? Just curious your thoughts. Yeah. So, you know, Facebook ads, bulk of the population is on Facebook. I mean, it's got the biggest audience out there. And so if you are just going in and boosting posts, posts like randomly, like you don't have any strategy behind who it is, you're trying to target. I think you're pretty much like throwing spaghetti at the wall, just kind of see in what, what, what sticks. There's, there are ways to be much more strategic about your ads that you're doing on Facebook, Instagram. And, you know, and I'll talk about like, did it a second, but with regards to Facebook and Instagram, there's a lot of ways to kind of layer your farming. So if you are farming specific areas, you can layer some digital ads on top of that. So utilizing phone numbers and email addresses that you may have from your farms, you can create customer audiences and target them in more than one way. So you may be sending them a postcard in the mail. So they're getting that. And then they're also starting to see you online. So they're like, oh my gosh, this person is everywhere. I think that that's probably the most strategic way to do any kind of Facebook or Instagram ads at this point, especially for real estate. It's just being, you know, strategic, you could even, you know, download your, your contacts from the cloud and Google and, you know, so that way you have like your spirit and some people that maybe, maybe, maybe you worked within the past that you may not have contact with anymore. So there's a lot of ways to do them. That's a really good point too. So basically what Tara was saying is you can take your CRM and, and export all of your contacts and upload those into Facebook as a custom audience. And what Facebook's going to do is try to match those email addresses and the names with accounts that they have. And it isn't going to be a perfect match always and it might not find everybody. But it's going to find a lot of people. And if you upload all your clients, for example, you probably wouldn't want them to receive an ad that says, Hey, buy your, buy your first home, right? Assuming that these are people that have already bought a home, right? They might want to get a thing about are you looking to upgrade to your next property? You could make a specific ad for that or looking to make a change. That kind of thing. So you can get really granular about this and there doesn't have to be a million different buckets. But there may be a few buckets of, you know, this isn't yet a client. This is a client that I've already worked with. And you can have different ads going in this way. And guys, I used to Facebook used to come on my show every single month, corporate and talk about it. And they would say, do not boost post. Do not boost post if you're a REALTOR. They would literally just tell us to do it. It goes back a few years, but the head of the real estate department and Instagram or at a Facebook would bet I would say do not boost posts. Guys, you want to be way more strategic. And so Tara can actually help you with all of this stuff too and help you figure out what your audiences are. It is a little complicated, but she can help you get, get set up that way. Yeah, 100%. And with regards to LinkedIn, so LinkedIn is actually has been named like one of the top things to do for 2024 as far as ads are concerned. You know, there's a lot of opportunities there, particularly with people who are doing like commercial and agricultural things that are more business to business, but also on the luxury market. Like there's a lot of cat co-cats you can make. You can do some targeting with regards to job title things like that to kind of make your targeting a little bit more specific and segmented. And, you know, I personally have not run any ads on LinkedIn. This has just kind of done my research, so I'm excited to dive into it on my own and see what I could do. Some of my colleagues have been working on it and they've been just, you know, singing its phrases. So if you have not taken an opportunity to check out LinkedIn for your marketing efforts in 2024, that's definitely something to start keep an eye on. And it's also the social media platform that I think REALTORS use the very least. It seems to be not used at all by REALTORS and it is used by literally every other industry. So this is a place where I would spend a lot of time. For example, if you had a client that worked at a corporation in your local area, I would go into LinkedIn and see if I could find like the head of HR for that particular organization, if it's big enough to have that, or the owner and say, hey, I just worked with one of your employees. I helped them, you know, buy, sell or whatever. And I would love the opportunity to come and bring lunch for the audience, for the office and, you know, reach out and do a free webinar about, you know, working with a REALTOR, whatever. This is what you can use LinkedIn to do is you can actually find this information and use it in a hyper local way. So it's not just about making as many connections as you can on LinkedIn, which is great as well, or posting great content to LinkedIn, but you can actually use it for research and development to find opportunities for you to reach out to, you know, because every, every corporate person I know, they use LinkedIn. They love LinkedIn. They use it. REALTORS don't usually use it. So don't be, don't be fooled into thinking, oh, no one uses LinkedIn. They do. It's just REALTOR. Yeah, exactly. Yeah, I've used it more in the last like four years that I ever thought I would. But it's amazing. Like a number of connections that you can make on that platform. You know, it's great to just stay up to date on a lot of different market trends, because that's where it's a great place for you to also share your insights as far as like what you know about the market. So just be strategic about what you're sharing there. And, and I, and you join groups. There's, there's all kinds of things on there for you to participate in and engage. So yeah, I'm a big fan. We're actually streaming live to LinkedIn right now as well. So we stream the, yeah, we streamed to all the major platforms. And, and that's guys, you know, that's kind of what you, you want to, again, the whole point is, should I be on Facebook? Should I be on Instagram? Should I be on LinkedIn TikTok? Where is your audience hanging out? That's where you want to be. We're at, and also what you enjoy. Like if you hate LinkedIn, don't, don't do it then. If you hate TikTok, don't be on TikTok because it's, it's not going to work for you as well. You want to be on something that you feel comfortable with, but also that your audience, your, your, your, preferred audience is hanging out at. How do you know where your preferred audience hangs out? Ask them, send out a survey to all of your clients and say, Hey, I'm working on my marketing strategy for next year. Just curious, where do you spend the most time? Well, you know, what, what social media channels, if, if any, do you spend time on that will tell you we found out in an organization that I, that I help that unrelated real estate that LinkedIn was the number one place I would have never guessed that I would have guessed Facebook. But for this organization with thousands of members, LinkedIn was the clear winner and we wouldn't have known that had we not asked. So we put a lot of our resources in a LinkedIn at that point. So great suggestion there is just reach out to your audience and say, Hey, can you help me? I'm curious on where you're spending a lot of time. And that'll give you some guidance.
