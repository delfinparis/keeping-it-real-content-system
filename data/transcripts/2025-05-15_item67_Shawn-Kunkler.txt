[00:01:14] Today's episode is brought to you by corded.io.
[00:01:18] Are you looking for agents to join your brokerage or team?
[00:01:21] Now as a real estate recruiter, I can tell you the answer is always yes.
[00:01:26] But most agents aren't looking to move right now.
[00:01:29] So how do you know who to contact?
[00:01:31] Well, what if I were to tell you there's a recruiting and retention tool powered by artificial intelligence
[00:01:35] that shows you exactly which agents in your local market are looking to leave their brokerage right now.
[00:01:42] And which agents at your own firm are also looking to leave you.
[00:01:47] Now, I've been recruiting real tours for 15 years and I've hired over 2,000 agents.
[00:01:51] I can tell you with no exaggeration.
[00:01:54] This is the tool I've been waiting for.
[00:01:56] Corded's AI looks for trends across dozens of variables for each agent in your market and shows you which agents they believe are likely to move.
[00:02:04] Not only does it do that, but corded's AI went and visited my recruiting website and read everything I offer.
[00:02:11] So now when I'm recruiting, corded's AI tells me exactly what to say based on that agent's needs and what my brokerage can offer.
[00:02:19] It even writes emails for me.
[00:02:20] I've never seen anything like it and I use it every single day.
[00:02:25] Now, if you are looking to grow your brokerage, corded.io is the best tool out there.

[00:02:51] Hello and welcome to another episode of Keeping It Real, the largest podcast made by real estate agents and four real estate agents.
[00:02:58] My name is DJ Paris.
[00:03:00] I am your guide and host through the show.
[00:03:02] And in just a moment, we're going to be speaking with top producer Sean Conkler before we get to Sean.
[00:03:08] And by the way, this episode is amazing because not only is Sean a top producing agent, he is also a student of top producers in the business.
[00:03:17] It's how he learned how to become a great agent and learn from him as he learned from others.
[00:03:23] It's so great.
[00:03:24] I can't wait for you guys to hear it.
[00:03:25] Before we get to that, as a reminder, as always, please, please tell a friend about the show.
[00:03:30] That's how you help us grow and help us continue to do all of these episodes.
[00:03:34] We appreciate it.

[00:03:39] They are so wonderful and help keep this whole machine running.
[00:03:42] All right, guys, let's get to it.
[00:03:44] My conversation with Sean Conkler.
[00:03:59] Today, my guest is Sean Conkler with Compass in San Francisco.
[00:04:03] He is part of Homeward Associates.
[00:04:07] And let me tell you more about Sean.
[00:04:10] So he's an East Coast native who traded Connecticut winners for California, sunny skies in his early 20s.
[00:04:15] And Sean has cultivated a deep love for Northern California and all that his community provides.
[00:04:20] Mastering the art of customer success in his previous career, he pivoted from luxury athletic clubs into the real estate realm in 2017 and is not look back.
[00:04:29] Serving the same discerning bake area clientele, Sean has honed his keynability to anticipate clients, individual needs and identify the right course of action to achieve success driven by a strong desire to help others put down roots in the beloved community.
[00:04:44] He calls home his passion for real estate is possible.
[00:04:47] It is evident in the way he thoughtfully guides clients through the home buying process advocating every step of the way we should mention San Francisco, not barrier rather, not the easiest market to be a REALTOR in as we probably all know.
[00:05:02] So I love talking to agents that are really, you know, doing well out there.
[00:05:06] I just, who scares me to even think about trying something like that.
[00:05:09] He's also an accomplished martial artist and publish author the motor.
[00:05:13] He's also motorcycle enthusiast and he loves riding up the coast visiting museums and hiking Bay area trails on the weekend.
[00:05:19] I want everybody. Oh, and he's a podcast host.
[00:05:21] When everybody to check out his podcast.
[00:05:23] It's very similar to this one in the sense that he talks to top producers.
[00:05:27] And so we couldn't be a bigger supporter REALTOR 180 is the podcast anywhere.

[00:05:44] Sean, welcome.
[00:05:45] Thank you.
[00:05:46] I'm so happy to be here.
[00:05:47] This is going to be fun.
[00:05:49] I am so well, this is light lifting day for me because you are a podcast host.
[00:05:53] So no pressure, but you can you know, the lot of a lot of the interesting stuff is going to come from you
[00:06:01] because you're used to having interesting conversations with agents.
[00:06:04] But I always like to start actually before we get started, I have a question for you.
[00:06:10] And I apologize.
[00:06:11] I usually tell guests about this head of time.
[00:06:12] I didn't this time.
[00:06:13] So I apologize for that.
[00:06:15] But I think you'll be able to handle it, which is what's the best piece of advice you ever received?
[00:06:21] You know, from 2017 on about, you know, being an agent.
[00:06:24] What was the best piece of advice you received?
[00:06:26] Wow.
[00:06:27] That is a great question right out of the gate.
[00:06:30] What's the best piece of advice?
[00:06:34] I want to say, it's funny.
[00:06:38] My brain is going in 20 different directions.
[00:06:43] But I think the best piece of advice that I ever received was wherever you're at in your career.
[00:06:52] Let's say you're one to going into year two or year 10 going into 11 is talk to people who are successful and ask them specifically what they did.
[00:07:12] And so I would say surround yourself with highly successful people and then ask them what they specifically did at that specific threshold.
[00:07:29] That's really, really great advice.
[00:07:32] I always like to say that I'm not going to be able to do that.
[00:07:32] 
[00:07:32] 
[00:07:32] 
[00:07:32] 
[00:07:32] I always love, it's always the fundamentals, right?
[00:07:34] And that is such a great fundamental thing that we should all be doing.
[00:07:38] And also, you know, asking those people slightly above, like, how do you, how do you get from here to there?
[00:07:44] And finding out what those tasks are probably the same tasks, you know, that you do now.
[00:07:50] And what's one bad piece of advice that you've received as an agent?
[00:07:55] I think it's, you know, it's twofold.
[00:07:58] It's I had a really amazing principal when I was in high school.
[00:08:03] And he always said consider the source.
[00:08:07] And so like if you were getting negative feedback from somebody or like someone who's picking on you would be like consider the source.
[00:08:13] And I think when you qualify advice and then you really consider the source, the reality is you only have a couple mentors, but a lot of people, everybody's going to give you advice.
[00:08:24] And figure out what that person's really great at.
[00:08:27] And if they're not, then I probably want to take their advice.
[00:08:32] Yeah, I think that's very wise.
[00:08:34] Wise way, consider the source. That's great.
[00:08:36] Wow, that is fantastic.
[00:08:39] Well, thank you again for being on our show.
[00:08:42] I would love to get to know you a bit better and find out how you got from the East Coast to the West Coast.
[00:08:47] So tell us about previously in, you know, you were in the luxury athletic club business and then, you know, making this the shift how why wear tell me give me this specifics.
[00:08:58] Oh God, that was almost two decades ago.
[00:09:01] So it was quite a while ago.
[00:09:03] I was, yeah, I grew up in the burbs and I grew up in a town that was very, it was a factory town, my dad owned a factory.
[00:09:11] And I grew up working in his machine shop and learning the inner workings of that.
[00:09:20] And I realized that, well, it's a great path.
[00:09:22] It just wasn't for me.
[00:09:24] It wasn't my DNA and I really wanted to, I wanted to do more and different.
[00:09:30] Simultaneously, I was a really insecure and scared kid.
[00:09:34] And so I realized that I need to just get in front of more people to overcome that, that fear that I had.
[00:09:43] And I had an opportunity to do sales and I was about, I want to say 18 years old.
[00:09:49] And I, my, my ex works for a motorcycle seat company and they were hosting a huge event.
[00:09:56] And I went to the event and it was a three day events and it was basically selling seats and installing them.
[00:10:06] And we had a dinner at the close of the event.
[00:10:09] And the president stood up and there was, you know, the senior VPs and the VPs and the regional directors and all these people and he's like,
[00:10:19] I want to basically share what happened in the weekend and blah, blah, blah.
[00:10:22] And he like goes through and he's like, the top two sales people.
[00:10:25] He was the number one, the president and number two was me.
[00:10:31] And I had never done sales before and that's where I got my taste.
[00:10:34] Simultaneously, I, you know, I grew up in a small town and I realized going to New York on weekends and hanging out in Boston that there was just something about a city.
[00:10:45] And wanting to do more, wanting to figure out this different new space.
[00:10:51] I was always enthralled with martial arts.
[00:10:54] I remember as a kid like laying on the couch, I had bad asthma and I, it'd be like the weekend and I'd watch like Kung Fu Marathons and I was just, I loved it.
[00:11:04] I don't know what it was about it, but I loved it.
[00:11:07] And so, you know, as I got a little bit older and started to figure out things, I realized one, I wanted to live in a city and two.
[00:11:13] I really wanted to study martial arts and going to New York and realizing they have the same weather patterns as can.
[00:11:20] And I was like, you know, I really want to go to a different hub somewhere else.
[00:11:27] And I had a pen pal growing up who lived in San Francisco and I learned tidbits about it.
[00:11:34] And I think it was four months later, we moved sight unseen.
[00:11:40] Amazing. And here you are.
[00:11:43] So what I, what I love about what, what you do is obviously you are in, you're doing something I am, I don't do, which is I am not out there in the trenches selling.
[00:11:52] So you are, which I very much admire.
[00:11:56] And on top of that, you also have this great podcast.
[00:12:00] And you're talking to other successful agents.
[00:12:03] So you're giving back to the industry.
[00:12:05] And I think that's unbelievable as well.
[00:12:08] So, you know, tell us a little bit about why do you decide to start the podcast.
[00:12:14] Great question. So I, when I was building my, my real estate team, I had a business coach and we the very first steps were, it was a business coach, not a real estate coach because
[00:12:27] you know, real estate coach is not all of them, but they tend to do a lot of blocking and tackling.
[00:12:32] You need to make more calls, you need to do more of this and you hear the scripts and I didn't want that I wanted business help and advice.
[00:12:40] And so we started down the path of what culture are you looking to build with your team, what's your mission.
[00:12:46] And the mission statement was from JFK, a rising tide lifts all boats.
[00:12:52] And in that, the spirit of that carried over into the podcast of, I really wanted to spend time with top, top, top.
[00:13:02] performers and learn firsthand what they're doing.
[00:13:06] And with that, how can I do that and do what I enjoy, which is learning and talking to really amazing people.
[00:13:14] And simultaneously lift the bar for the industry.
[00:13:18] And it just kind of, it evolved and it evolved out of my curiosity and my passions, if you will.
[00:13:28] Yeah, it's amazing. It's not easy to start a podcast and I've been there and I've continued to be there and I know just how challenging it is.
[00:13:39] And I also know how much fun it is to talk to top producers and find out what they're doing and share their success with others.
[00:13:48] And I know that you've got a hundred hours of interviews under your belt, which is again an amazing accomplishment.
[00:13:56] And I never have counted the number of hours I've done, but I imagine, you know, if I would have thought when I got to 100, whenever that was, that would have been a nice thing to celebrate.
[00:14:06] So I appreciate you acknowledging that I'm sort of the person that never quite knows how many how many episodes he's done or or what what our numbers are at.
[00:14:15] But I do love talking to top producers and it's something that if I were an agent or well, I technically am, but I don't practice if I were practicing it.
[00:14:23] Then I think I would still continue to do this because it is so exciting to hear top agents and you know, just sort of by sheer immersion being around people that are doing these things.
[00:14:34] You know, the the fundamentals get repeated the sort of special techniques get repeated.
[00:14:39] You know, there isn't typically a lot and I'm curious to get your perspective of, hey, I've got this secret sort of strategy that most people don't know occasionally I do hear that and that's fun.
[00:14:50] For the most part, it's I just practice the fundamentals over and over and over again and I work, you know, diligently to make sure that I treat this thing like a business and I structure my day and you know, all of the things that that agents will tell us.
[00:15:02] And yet it seems so hard for so many agents to do that.
[00:15:05] And so I think, you know, just being a producing agent yourself, you know, this is probably just great reminders of every single time you talk to a top producer like, oh yeah, this is what I what I'm doing as well.
[00:15:17] I completely agree. Yeah, it's I think there's a great quote and I want to say it's socrates and it's learning is remembering and you know, more often than not we know we know how to have be healthy.
[00:15:31] We know how to have a healthy business. We know how to do budgets and things like that.
[00:15:36] We just stop doing it. We get distracted in our days and our lives and we we don't do it or we, you know, we just you know, it's, you know, what's one little piece of cake.
[00:15:46] And then you can do that one little piece of cake more and more and and suddenly you're you're at a different different place.
[00:15:53] And so yeah, I think the podcast is the the experience I've had.
[00:15:58] It's twofold. It's the reminder to keep doing this thing and then it's I'm always looking for that one nugget. What's the what's that one thing that I can not change in my business but improve what we're doing by 1%
[00:16:14] and if I can improve it just 1% every day. That's a radical change at the end of the year and of two years at the end of 10 years.
[00:16:23] It's a completely different direction that you're traveling in.
[00:16:27] Yeah, it's that metaphor of what what's not even a metaphor. It's what pilots do right. They think if they're off by even a half a degree, you know, pretty soon it's not even close to where they're where you want to land.
[00:16:37] So there's the self correcting mechanism of always sort of staying on the path, which is doing doing all of those, you know, sort of habits, you know, for for lack of a better term these these habits that we want to cultivate that ultimately continue to reinforce, you know, us pressing down that path and it's hard because
[00:16:55] the most brokerages don't have a structure in place because while you're not an employee at most brokerages. So you are kind of left to your own devices.
[00:17:03] You can't really be told to do a certain number of hours or a certain number of activities other than compliance, you know, and it can be very isolating.
[00:17:13] I think to be a REALTOR it can be it can be tricky. Many agents aren't working in offices these days. So it feels even maybe more singular and individual and it's look, you know, we we are not always able to do everything ourselves.
[00:17:28] And I think this idea of community is so important and I love that you're creating that with your podcast. I've certainly felt that we've built some version of that here.
[00:17:38] And I want to I want to talk about you practicing because moving out to San Francisco again one of the toughest markets. If not maybe the number one or number two toughest markets to not only purchase real estate, but to be real estate agent because of course the price points are so high.
[00:17:52] It's such an attractive occupation. If you can get those land those deals because obviously a lot there's a lot of revenue there. And yet it seems to me to be gosh.
[00:18:04] I don't know how anyone gets business with so many agents and I've talked to a lot of San Francisco agents and you know obviously they figured out.
[00:18:10] So I'd love to hear from you about how you made that transition and how you started growing about growing that your your own business.
[00:18:16] Yeah, it's it's a spicy market. That's for sure. There's to give context San Francisco is only seven by seven miles. Yeah.
[00:18:26] And so the footprint of San Francisco is smaller than Disney's parking lot.
[00:18:31] Mind blowing, right. And within that there's about roughly 6000 practicing agents.
[00:18:38] And so to your point, the competition is fierce and the price points are high. The price points.
[00:18:45] The opening price point is luxury in most other markets for a two bedroom condo.
[00:18:53] And so it's tricky.
[00:18:54] But you know similar to the podcast is I figured out if you if you hang out with the right with successful people virtue of osmosis it rubs off.
[00:19:07] And then simultaneously if you if you hang out where successful buyers and sellers are those conversations are naturally going to come up.
[00:19:19] So I had a teacher in school who always would joke and say you don't go elephant hunting in a bar. Right. You have to you have to go to where the elephants are is really what it what it comes down to.
[00:19:33] And so I very early on I realized I took the city and I kind of you know broke it up and figured out what section of the city do I want to really cut my teeth in and then two fold what brokerage was doing the most transactions in that area.
[00:19:52] And then who were the those top agents doing it.
[00:19:56] And then I hung around those agents I would go to their open houses and just introduce myself and say hi and talk to them.
[00:20:05] And eventually I won the trust of a very prolific agent who didn't have a team.
[00:20:11] And I was given the amazing opportunity to host one of her open houses and it was on the north side of the city it was a 2.5 million dollar property.
[00:20:22] And I would show up 20 minutes early and I would put like six six of my signs out.
[00:20:29] And I would text her when I got there early I would bring a broom and I would sweep the street in front I would clean up the house I would let her know if anything was was off or needed refilling and I would just take care of it and I would let her know that I'm taking care of it.
[00:20:44] And through that she not only gave me a ton of those open houses but then it parlayed into other open houses.
[00:20:52] And from doing that and being consistent and doing that I I feel like I got really lucky but I think luck always meets hard work and I met a guy who had to move he was on a very tight time crunch he had cash in my first transaction in the city was for 2.6.
[00:21:11] Wow and I was like blown away another couple who I met at that property I've got them into contract a couple months later for 1.8 and it my business transformed literally overnight but it it didn't it you know it started with me choosing the right brokerage and then choosing to be around those the right people and then going in not just doing a good job at these open houses but doing such a noteworthy job for me.
[00:21:41] So I was like I was going to go to the office for that agent to make that agent looks so good in front of their client I would send her these reports that were a page long with bullet points of what time I arrived what time I left what the weather was like who were the parties who came through who was their agent I would hyperlink the agents.
[00:22:00] I made it so darn easy for her that she couldn't say no when I when I said hey do you have any other open house opportunities and eventually she said here's the spreadsheet of all my properties all the dates are in there put your name under anyone's you want to host and that's that's how it's just snowballs for me and it's just a really quick clip.
[00:22:23] I wish all of our audience to really really go back and listen to shunt all that story over and over and over again because it is the story that I have heard over and over again doing this podcast I cannot tell you you probably have heard it as well is this beg plead and and earn a top producer you know or any producer really say I I want to I want to do this you know I want to do open house.
[00:22:52] I want to do open house and what what do I need to do to earn that trust you know and like you said make it really easy for them to want you back you know and boy you know they're getting reports I mean who sends reports you know almost nobody probably you know to to the other listing agent and yet you know yeah I I'd see boy what what an amazing what an amazing opportunity for you and and for everyone thinking open houses don't work they work if you were if you know what you're doing and if you're you know if my
[00:23:22] anyway we know they were so wow what a what a wonderful message for the audience this is so smart so you know I would do that you know whatever brokerage you're at look at the other listings from that brokerage in that area and let's start talking to those top agents or any agent and saying hey I want to get better open houses and here's my plan that I I want to do does this meet your standards Mr. Mrs. broker is this what you're looking for in an open house and if not help me fill in the blanks and let's let me go do this for you and
[00:23:52] prove to you that I'm going to make you look amazing to the neighborhood and the sellers and who doesn't want to look amazing to the client right so exactly what a wonderful suggestion so thank you for for that again it's it's so fundamental and yet it is so easily ignored and it takes courage to ask a top producer to let you show their you know several billion dollar listing that is not an easy ask because of course they're like why would I give that to you well eventually you like
[00:24:22] Sean said he goes I earned my way into that you know probably wasn't the very first time he asked you probably I imagine you you probably had to you know demonstrate that you had the the competency to do something like that yeah I mean I you know it's we've all heard you know with with clients you they have to know you like you then trust you
[00:24:43] and it's it's not just similar it's the same formula for agents and I remember this agent who didn't know me from from anybody else I went to her open house I introduced myself I saw she was busy I just said hi I wanted to introduce myself I'm Sean like let me know if you ever need anything happy to help left when I was leaving I saw that her sign on the corner had blown over
[00:25:07] and so I stood it back up I took a photo and I said hey you're signed on the corner blew over I leaned it up so it wouldn't fall over again and then that was it and and but I sent it with an image and I remember she thanked me and so it's it's those it's the little things and and you know it's it's now they they kind of know you're looking out right you're you're aware and it's it's you're getting on the you get on the radar first
[00:25:37] and then you just build from there it's the same I think for agents recruiting for agents wanting to get in front of top performers to do open houses to get in front of clients it's the same formula treat everybody like a client follow up with them check in with them see how they're doing and don't ask permission to be supportive just be supportive and
[00:26:03] I've I have found from doing that good good things come from it and just I think simultaneously you know do things without expectation just just do good work just do really good workout there good work usually ends up winning because there's not in abundance of good work in in most industries and most professions and and even within sometimes most offices so I think this this idea of
[00:26:31] elevating 1% you know that making a 1% doable we can do 1% I can get better at my listing presentation 1% or my you know open house or my customer care calls or whatever you know we can do we can do one 100% that's hard 1% we can do that and then sure enough after
[00:26:51] after a few months it's you are at 100% probably even though technically you know you're just making these incremental changes but all the sudden big big things start shifting so I want to
[00:27:00] chat with you because you've talked to so many top agents and I know you have sort of these three items of that you find or strategies or techniques that agents are using really successful ones so I'd love for you to share that with our audience.
[00:27:16] Yeah it's interesting it's it's kind of you know everything is very Yin and Yang push and pull and
[00:27:25] the simultaneously if you do the right things you tend to stop doing the wrong things right if you want to start eating healthier
[00:27:32] and your caloric intake is all healthy food it leaves less room for unhealthy food right and if you allocate time to work out you have
[00:27:42] led less time to sit around on the couch eating ice cream and so a business is not dissimilar so if you just
[00:27:50] tend to stop doing the things that don't work and do more of the things that work you
[00:27:56] successful come from it and so the three are are more or less the what you shouldn't be doing but baked in that is what you
[00:28:04] should be doing and so I call them the the tourist the racehorse and the ping pong and I've been I love it
[00:28:12] the and I did it in this way because the way our brains work is we remember stories
[00:28:19] and they're easier to remember and so if you just visualize a a racehorse and a ping pong and a
[00:28:25] tourist they will these these things will make sense and and so the tourist years and years ago I worked
[00:28:31] at the Kung Fu school and I was running the schools the federation had quarters and I was under a lot of
[00:28:36] stress and pressure and I'm trying to run a business and I would have instructors call out all the time
[00:28:43] and so I'm running a business and I'm teaching 16 classes a week and burning out and I burnt out
[00:28:49] is is really what happened and I I wound up calling a friend and we were talking and he just sold
[00:28:56] this business and had obviously some good proceeds and he's like we should just take a trip
[00:29:03] and I was like that sounds like a great idea and so I submitted my resignation and we booked the trip
[00:29:10] to Italy for a month and we landed in Milan and the best part was we had a flight in and we had a
[00:29:18] flight out when we had one month and we had zero place to be and so we would literally get up in
[00:29:23] the morning look at a map and go okay we can go here and if if we're gonna flip a coin if it lands
[00:29:30] on heads we'll go here and if we flip a tail so we'll go here and we would literally flip a coin to
[00:29:35] figure out where to go fun fact there's a villa villa conchlor up near Venice I didn't get to go see
[00:29:43] it but it's on my it's on my to-do list and and so we had this meandering adventure of just
[00:29:50] literally flipping a coin of what to do every day and so the spirit of that and how that relates to
[00:29:56] business is if you have no plan that is your plan and and thus the agents who don't have a plan
[00:30:04] they tend to just wake up in the morning flip a coin and whatever it lands on they tend to do and
[00:30:11] so they don't do anything with with a plan and the agents who are succeeding on a very high level
[00:30:17] they have a very clear plan they know where they're going and they know the strategies to get them
[00:30:25] there and so my advice would be to not be the tourist is really what it summarizes down to and
[00:30:32] and have a business plan and more importantly I have found from working with agents who I've
[00:30:36] recruited to the team is have a one-page business plan if if you can't get it down distilled into
[00:30:42] one page you are never ever ever going to execute on it but more importantly you have to revisit it
[00:30:49] you have to sit with it every Monday and look at it and figure out last week did I do the tasks
[00:30:57] to move towards this plan and it's not one of these at the end of the years you set it and then
[00:31:04] forget it and then you re-look at it next year and you said oh we missed or we hit great job
[00:31:09] that's that's not how you use it and so having a really concise plan is is what's going to
[00:31:17] carry you to success so don't be the tourist but be the almost gosh you know I don't know the
[00:31:25] tip the the the opposite of tourists is but but certainly somebody who knows exactly what they're
[00:31:31] a pilot a pilot you know to go back to your analogy of flying you know a plane flying from
[00:31:37] New York to San Francisco is off course 90 percent of the time the pilot's goal is to keep keep
[00:31:44] it course corrected that's that's their goal and so within that there's no failures the the pilot
[00:31:52] didn't fail because they need to course correct it was an outcome and they had an outcome they didn't
[00:31:57] want so they changed it to have the outcome they do want and so having the mindset of their
[00:32:03] their aren't failures there's outcomes and stop doing the outcomes that are giving you what you
[00:32:08] know want and start doing more of the ones that are giving you what you do want yeah yeah that makes
[00:32:14] perfect sense um so yeah I agree it's talking about attentionality right it's the idea of
[00:32:21] instead of being reactive and it's so easy to be reactive but it can feel so productive to be
[00:32:27] reactive things that come at us come in or inbox or text and phone calls and we can just
[00:32:33] spend all day you know batting the balls back and forth that are hit coming out our way and
[00:32:38] certainly we have to do that and we also need to have a time where it's like no from this time
[00:32:43] to this time I'm doing this other thing and this other thing is to help me course correct so that
[00:32:48] I'm not just batting you know the customer service uh you know balls all day long you know I have
[00:32:55] to be prospecting I have to be you know nurturing my database and so those are the things that
[00:33:01] yeah they're they're not as easy to get started and also they're sometimes not as much fun right
[00:33:06] that's the other part is that it isn't necessarily the most pleasurable tasks that are the most
[00:33:10] um profitable right and so that's the other thing is we we think we also have to really get
[00:33:16] comfortable with the idea that discomfort is is the part probably the pay you know the the name
[00:33:22] of the game is how do we stay in discomfort healthy discomfort you know discomfort that's
[00:33:26] leading us to where we want to go and that's not easy to to step into that because you have to be
[00:33:31] willing to stand in the in the way of a bit of misery um and misery is the path and because
[00:33:37] through misery you you know you get stronger and you get better and and it's and then all the sudden
[00:33:42] you're out of the misery and you're you're reaping the rewards but misery is the place you gotta
[00:33:47] you gotta be willing to step into and it's it's not a it's not a fun lesson to hear and I wish there
[00:33:52] was another way you know it relates to working out right you go to the gym and then your sore
[00:34:02] that's discomfort but you you earn that discomfort that's good discomfort because tomorrow when
[00:34:08] you show up your body's healing it's growing it's changing and you're stronger and so that thing
[00:34:14] that made you discomfort are uncomfortable in the beginning no longer makes you uncomfortable
[00:34:18] and that's our brains are actually wired like that the more that you do something that's uncomfortable
[00:34:23] that part of your brain actually gets stronger and so the next time you do it it's not as uncomfortable
[00:34:28] that's why you know you see these amazing public speakers on stage in their charismatic and charming
[00:34:35] engaging with with with everybody or your podcast there's no way your first podcast was as good as
[00:34:42] the one you you're your last six I eliminated it for my memory because it was so bad mine too
[00:34:49] I go back and I look at the first one and I was like oh my god this was painful but I got more
[00:34:55] and more comfortable and I'm sure now you don't think about who's listening you focus on the
[00:34:59] conversation and you you kind of stay in the moment and but you got there by doing that uncomfortable
[00:35:05] thing so many times that it doesn't I'm sure you don't get jitters anymore you don't get the butterflies
[00:35:14] you just you're like all right I know what to do let's go like this is amazing this can be fun
[00:35:18] and it's it's the same with all the aspects of our business I agree and I would also add to that
[00:35:25] to keep me honest that you know it's like you're going back to your workout metaphor so every time I
[00:35:32] go to the gym you know for example if I have to do a wall sit something that I'm not a fan of doing
[00:35:38] I don't like that exercise it's not enjoyable for me none of the exercises are enjoyable but
[00:35:43] that is one of the least enjoyable ones it hurts I have to hold it it's this isometric exercise
[00:35:48] that I go basically almost until failure so I'm almost like collapsing and yet that's the path
[00:35:53] because that's how muscles get torn apart and they rebuild stronger and then to keep my keep me honest
[00:35:58] is yes the next time maybe maybe that particular amount of time is is easier but that means I have to
[00:36:05] do more to make it even harder and I have to keep doing that to ratchet up to keep growing and so
[00:36:10] you know back to this podcast yeah I don't get jitters but what am I working on to make this even
[00:36:15] better for the players and the truth is that yeah I could kind of phone it in because I've done it
[00:36:21] long enough and I'm sure there's times where I have if I you know if I'm being perfectly honest
[00:36:25] yeah and I don't want to do that and I want to keep growing so it's always this consistent you know
[00:36:31] we return to discomfort that again I wish it wasn't that way I wish we just didn't have to
[00:36:37] but it seems to be rewarded it's rewarded by society it's rewarded by ourselves it's rewarded
[00:36:43] just it you know by industry so again it's it's never the message I want to hear
[00:36:49] you know well said I mean and I appreciate the reframe is you're right like we even if you
[00:36:55] you have figured out even if you got the wall sit for 15 seconds now it's 16 yeah and then it's
[00:37:01] 17 then it's 18 and then eventually it's like two minutes three minutes and you're like oh my god
[00:37:05] this is crazy you're right you're absolutely right you do need you need that continuous growth and
[00:37:13] that's where when we're growing as humans that's when we're typically the happiest it's 100% those
[00:37:21] those really challenging experiences in our lives are usually that that moment after was the
[00:37:29] biggest growth we've had yeah I totally agree and I just thought came to me that I wanted to toss
[00:37:36] in which is while I'm doing for example the wall sit and it's that you know higher level that I
[00:37:43] did from the previous day doing it or the previous time I have to be you know I said this to my
[00:37:48] trainer a year or two ago I said oh I'm never gonna feel strong when I'm working out and she goes
[00:37:54] that is correct no matter how strong you actually are you will never feel strong working out if you
[00:38:00] work out more right away and so it's kind of that that willingness to be like oh I'm not going
[00:38:04] I'm always going to feel like there's another level to achieve you know and and that to me is how
[00:38:12] really successful agents do it it's not that they're down on themselves or they think they're worthless
[00:38:16] or they you know that I don't think is a good idea I think shame really shuts us down but if we
[00:38:21] can say hey here's where I'm at here's where I want to be and I'm always gonna strive to get just
[00:38:26] a little bit one percent that one percent better I think is such a good message I'm so glad you
[00:38:31] shared that because that's something we can we can jump on do but we have to be willing to go
[00:38:35] what what's the discomfort that that one percent is going to entail and I'm gonna have to sit with it
[00:38:40] but I'm gonna have pride at the end of that I'm going to also probably have results and and it's
[00:38:49] going to just you know continue to to further my growth okay tell us about the ping pong I'd love
[00:38:53] to hear so we talked about tourist and being the pilot as opposed to the tourist tell us about ping pong
[00:38:58] the ping pong is you know this is a pattern that I've seen with with agents who kind of started to
[00:39:05] figure it out and I've done it myself and my career is the ping pong is you start doing that thing
[00:39:11] that really works for you and then you become really successful in doing that one thing but then
[00:39:17] you also become very busy so then you recede from doing that one thing and then the business
[00:39:24] and then you're like shoot shoot shoot I don't have any sales I don't have a pipeline so then you
[00:39:28] go back to doing that one thing or you try something new and then that thing doesn't work so then you
[00:39:34] try something else and that doesn't work and then you go back to the thing that works and you're like
[00:39:38] wow this really works you you do that thing a ton of times now you're again busy and successful
[00:39:45] and you stop doing that thing and so your your business ricochets from having abundance to scarcity
[00:39:54] and back and forth and back and forth and that really genuinely relates to systems and processes
[00:40:00] and no one wants to talk about it because it's not sexy but they don't have the system
[00:40:06] in the process of consistently doing that thing to gain new new contacts and then having the
[00:40:16] system to follow up what's what's the actual workflow after that and then again going out and
[00:40:23] doing that activity again say the open house is and then collecting those names I can't even tell
[00:40:29] you how many agents are amazing I'll use open houses as an example they're amazing at collecting
[00:40:35] the names and then they're like well the person didn't respond so yeah they're their tire kickers
[00:40:41] or you know look he lose or whatever they are and I hate both of those phrases and it's like well
[00:40:47] how many times did you follow up well I sent them an email yeah and you're like well how many times
[00:40:52] once and so it's like you need to system on the back end to you to do it more than once in the
[00:40:58] reality is marketing statistically we need to hear about something seven to nine times before we
[00:41:07] actually engage with it so the math is the reality is you're going to have to meet 100 people
[00:41:15] to have a 2% conversion meaning two closes 100 people to have two closes and you're going to have
[00:41:20] to follow up with 100 people north of seven times yeah and most people don't have that system in
[00:41:28] place and so their business tends to ping pong is sadly what happens and they also don't have the
[00:41:35] willingness and again I'm not I this you know there before the grace of God go I so I am not I am not
[00:41:42] dissimilar from this but they don't have the willingness to say I'm not going to see the result on
[00:41:47] the third call in fact if I do it's a fluke right on the third text the third phone call the third
[00:41:52] email if they somehow are like let's start working together I just got real lucky because it's
[00:41:58] really going to take right probably even more than than seven to nine touches you know it might be
[00:42:02] 30 but this idea of I'm going to earn this I'm going to earn this just like you earned your way into
[00:42:09] you know to some open houses you have to earn it and you know other sometimes you get lucky and
[00:42:14] those are the ones that probably hurt people the most because they're so yeah they're they're so
[00:42:20] fun easy win the easy win you know like oh this is easy I only need to do it one time but you know
[00:42:26] to go back to the the whole gym is how many times have you how many people in the world have gone
[00:42:34] into a gym one time had an amazing workout and they're like they look into me and like wow I'm fit
[00:42:39] for life yeah never happens you have to go back but not only go back you have to go back consistently
[00:42:46] over time and just because you get on the scale and it's the same number that doesn't mean that
[00:42:52] your body's not redoing a decomposition meaning your body fat is going down but your muscle is going
[00:43:00] up and so the scale is exactly the same and so just because you don't see the difference based on
[00:43:06] what you're measuring it doesn't mean you're not getting the results and I think that's you know you
[00:43:11] have that one easy hit you get that you you know you meet that client at the open house and they write
[00:43:17] the offer on that property then you get lazy you don't build the muscle and and so the muscle really
[00:43:24] is develops through the practice of the follow up and it's not it's it's not a pass fail just because
[00:43:32] they didn't respond that doesn't mean you failed you're just practicing your follow up and then
[00:43:36] within the practice practice different follow ups and and never open an email this is like the
[00:43:42] ban my existence never open an email with them just following up I hate that yeah because
[00:43:48] you're fishing instead listen to whatever the conversation was and then don't say I'm following
[00:43:55] up but follow up with a piece of information that is then valuable to what they're wanting or
[00:44:03] needing if you met them at a three bedroom and it wasn't a good fit for them hey can you imagine
[00:44:08] yourself living here now you know what we really need a second bath and you were able to collect
[00:44:13] the email well then your follow up should be hey I wanted to check in I know this property wasn't a
[00:44:19] good fit because x y and z but I found this other one that's off market and it is did you want to hear
[00:44:24] more information about it yeah it's great it's it's this I was thinking about you here's something that
[00:44:30] you might want and letting that be the guiding star versus you know I have to check this you know
[00:44:38] this is my fourth email so I have to just keep keep keep bugging you until eventually you break down
[00:44:44] and go okay let's talk and you know maybe that works I don't know I don't suspect it works very well
[00:44:48] I think this providing value and going back to you know you're talking about ping pong versus
[00:44:54] systems or versus habits you know I might even say habits because habits are like okay I got
[00:45:01] I got the you know the easy win and now I got to go back and make all my dials and I have to go
[00:45:05] continue to you know do my customer service and I have to you know it's just consistently running
[00:45:09] running the the same playbook and making adjustments when necessary of course but just you know
[00:45:14] I talked to a top producer just last week and she I said what do you get just like you're
[00:45:20] saying what are you doing right after this because I always love to hear what top producers do during
[00:45:23] the day she goes oh I have to make like an hour and a half of phone calls and I said oh okay like
[00:45:27] what kind she goes oh they're my prospecting calls I do it every single day she's been in 20 years
[00:45:31] in the business love I said I said really and she said I have to she goes I don't it's the ping pong
[00:45:37] effect you know I'll be busy for a while and then I won't be she's like I can't not keep my
[00:45:44] pipeline full so and and I suspect she doesn't get you know a huge hit rate on those phone calls
[00:45:50] but she knows that that's the that's how you earn your way into somebody's into somebody's business
[00:45:56] you know again it goes back to out of a hundred people that you know that's in your database only
[00:46:02] 2% are going to convert that's just sales statistics only 2% and so 98 of those phone calls are
[00:46:11] they're not they're not useless they're future business because not only that each person knows
[00:46:20] 3 other people who are thinking about making a move later that year and so that's the gold
[00:46:28] and and and just you know out it's and I always use this word very carefully I used it earlier when
[00:46:34] we said but we don't make time like you can't make time it's if that's an impossibility but you
[00:46:40] can allocate time to do the thing and and in those top performers they always allocate time and
[00:46:46] think they they also live by another rule if you have to erase it you must replace it you have to
[00:46:53] put it somewhere else on your calendar and and that's you know the calendars another ping pong is
[00:46:59] the top performers and I'm sure you've seen this with your podcast all the top performers use a
[00:47:03] calendar and they all show up when they have to be there the I can always tell when I'm doing a
[00:47:09] podcast recording who's not a top performer just virtue of the emails that I get hey are we still
[00:47:16] on for Friday hey I don't see the link here it's like they're missing all of the cues along the way
[00:47:24] yeah yeah they don't have systems and there he is you know I do I had this thought and I
[00:47:30] I don't think this is our listeners so please I'm not talking to you the listener but other people
[00:47:35] that maybe aren't listening I think there's a lot of REALTORS maybe the majority of them that
[00:47:39] don't actually keep a calendar I I don't mean top performers they all do but I mean everybody else
[00:47:44] I suspect I think there's people in my personal life who are who are not REALTORS who don't keep a
[00:47:50] calendar I maybe they just have amazing memories I don't know but I certainly don't so I I have to
[00:47:55] structure every hour of the day pretty much and that doesn't mean I don't make adjustments we all do
[00:48:00] but I at least try to figure out what am I doing today and what time and I have to write it down
[00:48:07] because I won't remember but same I I cannot rely my memory at all and so our
[00:48:14] listing process for example there's a hundred and seven steps there's a hundred and seven
[00:48:18] steps because I cannot remember when we have four listings what if that one report was ordered
[00:48:24] for this specific property so the when you have systems and processes those three AM wake up panics
[00:48:30] don't happen anymore because there's a place for everything and everything's in its place
[00:48:37] yeah and you know it's a good reminder for me to tighten up some of my systems as well because
[00:48:41] that's that is a good if you are having those Sunday scaries or whatever day of the week that is for
[00:48:47] you it's you know I love that phrase yeah I didn't come up with it it's it's it's kind of out there
[00:48:54] in the in the vernacular now but I it's such so perfect because I know I know that feeling
[00:48:58] it's probably because I haven't tightened up my process and I haven't created a repeatable system
[00:49:04] so yeah let's talk about racehorse so we have we had tourist we have ping pong don't be a ping pong
[00:49:09] you know making sure that you're consistent with your with your disciplined habits and now tell us
[00:49:16] about racehorse yeah so you got to have a plan is the is the first thing and then you have this you
[00:49:20] have to have a system to execute the plan and now the racehorse the racehorse if you ever been to
[00:49:25] a racetrack when I turned 30 my friends all decided to take me to the racetrack which was super fun
[00:49:30] we all like put on suits in the women wars sunglasses and it was just like this just such a
[00:49:36] cool event but what's interesting is these racehorse is they have a goal right so they have the
[00:49:44] they're not the tourists they start at the start line and they their their goal is the finish line
[00:49:50] and not only that to finish first but the fascinating part is every horse has blinders on and so
[00:49:57] now the jockey's goal is to keep the horse doing its job and the blinders are now to keep the horse
[00:50:05] from getting distracted because if the horse doesn't have them and they focus on the horse that
[00:50:10] left the horse on the right is going to pass and if they're focused on the horse on the right the
[00:50:14] horse on the left is going to pass so they have blinders to keep from getting distracted and so then
[00:50:19] they can only focus on that one goal and I I feel that because we have the autonomy to do whatever
[00:50:27] we want with our day we don't put blinders on ourselves we don't have the discipline and we tend
[00:50:34] to just get distracted we sit in these meetings and we hear you know Joan over here is doing X,
[00:50:42] Y and Z and you're like I should be doing that and then so you introduce more ping pongs now you
[00:50:47] don't have one ping pong now you got two and then you're like well Mike over here is doing this
[00:50:53] thing so now let me bring in another ping pong and so now we've made ourselves really busy we don't
[00:50:58] have a system to implement these ping pongs and then we are now chasing more and more ping pongs
[00:51:05] and getting less and less results and so it really boils down to you is you got to have a plan
[00:51:13] you got to have the systems but then you got to stay focused and it's distractions that are
[00:51:20] really killing the business and those agents who are succeeding on an eye level they have those
[00:51:27] blinders on and you know even going back to agents leverage social media how many set a timer
[00:51:35] to focus on lead generation on social media but instead they actually just turn it into a
[00:51:43] scroll fast and then the next thing you know two hours went by and they're looking at like pictures
[00:51:49] of puppies yeah and and so really having the discipline in your in your day to say hey I'm doing
[00:51:58] this thing right now and I'm not going to be distracted by it one of the simple things that we do
[00:52:04] is with the podcast great example is when I launched it I decided that we're going to have a goal
[00:52:13] of of X amount of months and the goal is to get somebody subscribers or downloads and then
[00:52:21] so we won't measure anything until that point and within that I need to have enough budget allocated
[00:52:28] for that project and then I need to figure out who is going to execute what because I don't have
[00:52:35] time to add more ping pongs my schedule is already full and so now I have to figure out how to get
[00:52:41] some of these things off my plate and that's the pre-planning to a strategy whatever your
[00:52:46] marketing strategy is is having having the plan to it deciding things on the whim right not referring
[00:52:54] to your business plan is kind of the kiss of death it's kind of like you know being a tourist
[00:53:00] in the gym it's like if you went to the gym and said I don't feel like doing wall sits today but you
[00:53:05] did that over you know 20 30 40 days your wall sits are not going to get any better and you're not
[00:53:12] going to develop that core strength because you didn't feel like it that day and so again having
[00:53:19] the blinders on or the coach the mentor in your back pocket to say hey you really need to this
[00:53:27] was your plan now you need to execute on it yeah and and having accountability and I think you
[00:53:33] know that's where like you said coach comes in accountability partner if you can't do a coach you
[00:53:37] just find another agent look we're all struggling we're all struggling in different ways and so
[00:53:41] everybody's going to need accountability you know nobody does it all perfectly and getting
[00:53:46] somebody to help keep you on on task is you know obviously such a great a great thing and it's not
[00:53:53] a failure I want to make sure if you're thinking boy I I end up doing scrolling or I end up just
[00:53:58] infinitely scrolling because yeah that's what it's designed to do it's designed to make you do that
[00:54:03] that's not even your fault but there's a way around it right and that's by having some sort of
[00:54:09] accountability where maybe you only allow yourself a certain number of minutes you know and and having
[00:54:14] other other processes in place but yes the hard stuff is hard the hard stuff is hard
[00:54:20] good well said yeah and I again wish it wasn't boy I it'll be my first question if there is a
[00:54:26] creator and I get to meet the creator when I when I pass I'll be like why do you make all the good
[00:54:31] stuff so hard but you probably or he or she will probably say well yeah it's what's supposed to be so
[00:54:38] so it it just is it's kind of just reality so you know look you know we also I think you know
[00:54:43] just have to be really careful about technology just capturing our attention when it's it's designed
[00:54:50] to especially social media is designed to capture our attention because that's how it monetizes so
[00:54:55] of course it wants you infinitely scrolling like that's the best possible thing you can do for
[00:55:00] that service and it's tricky because you probably have to post on social media it's kind of like the
[00:55:07] person with the eating disorder trying to learn how to you know eat it in a non-disorderly way
[00:55:11] that's not easy because you have to eat so I get that the social media thing is really tricky but if
[00:55:17] you keep falling into that hole that's where you need to say you know I keep falling into this hole
[00:55:21] I just have to see find a solution and whether it's you put a timer on your phone that blocks you out
[00:55:26] or you get somebody to you know just check in with okay for the next half an hour I'm gonna post
[00:55:31] I'm gonna connect with my audience I'm going to write comments on there you know instead of
[00:55:36] consuming I'm going to be proactive and do something create content whatever and in 30 minutes
[00:55:41] I'm gonna call you and I'm gonna tell you how many of these I did you know or whatever whatever
[00:55:44] the system is you know don't feel ashamed my girlfriend struggles with with infinitely scrolling
[00:55:51] and she's a super successful executive so it's not and she's one of the most disciplined people
[00:55:57] I know and she can't hardly do it so and that's how it's designed I mean it's yeah I can be
[00:56:03] addictive and I think you make a really great point DJ is is to recognize you know to just be
[00:56:11] very honest with yourself and it's hard to say you know I do scroll too much and I do have a problem
[00:56:18] with that like at least whatever it is in your business just acknowledge it and then whatever
[00:56:24] I commend is find a solution is maybe log out every time you are done or delete the app so you
[00:56:35] have to re upload the app before and then you have to log back in to go do the activity make it a
[00:56:40] little bit harder a really subtle trick for those watching this podcast is my phone is black
[00:56:48] and white because the colors make it more attractive to our community receptors so if your phone is
[00:56:56] black and white it loses the red numbers that jump up on all the apps it's it doesn't have the
[00:57:04] same appeal to our brain and so the the satisfying part of it goes away and so there's there's
[00:57:13] tons of little tricks you can get a product like like loomlee for example and you go to that
[00:57:19] platform and you put all of your social posts in there and then you schedule them to go out so you
[00:57:25] don't even have to actually physically go to that app yeah and then as a tree this is where you know
[00:57:31] program the Pavlovian philosophy or strategy comes into play is listen I'm going to sit down for
[00:57:38] 30 minutes and make past client calls I'm just going to say hey I was thinking about you and wanted
[00:57:43] to say hi at the end of 30 minutes reward yourself set a timer for 10 minutes and doom scroll yeah
[00:57:51] create it as you know pain and pleasure create a reward for doing the thing or you know you know
[00:57:59] let's go back to working out it was I use that because it's easy for me because I did it for
[00:58:04] the bulk of my life yeah but if you're eating very disciplined for seven days a week months on end
[00:58:12] you get really it gets really challenging but if you have a cheat day yeah like sun that
[00:58:19] cheat meal just a cheat meal if a cheat day if you fall off the fall off the you know you fall
[00:58:25] completely out of cheat day and it just really hurts you the next then make it a cheat meal or
[00:58:30] two cheat meals or whatever yeah exactly and but you then give yourself the reward or like hey you
[00:58:36] know like I'm eating really disciplined all week my friends birthdays this weekend I'm going to have
[00:58:40] French Ryzen beer that just sounds amazing and now it's a reward for the hard work and so it's just
[00:58:46] it's just creating these it's stepping back and looking like where what area do I want to improve
[00:58:52] how can I improve it and then how do you how do you change it or maybe you don't like making
[00:58:57] phone calls maybe that's not your thing but maybe you have a really nice hot tub and you have a
[00:59:02] cell phone so you know what I'm gonna go put on some cool music I'm gonna go hop in the hot tub
[00:59:07] I'm gonna fire it up I'm gonna it's a cheat day I'm gonna pour glass of wine and you know what
[00:59:12] then I'm gonna make my calls yeah what a great experience I think what are you doing I'm you know
[00:59:18] what I was relaxing in my hot tub and I was just thinking about my past year and I was thinking
[00:59:24] about how I helped you so buy that home or sell it and I just wanted to say hi and how grateful I am
[00:59:29] for the opportunity to work with you yes and it's like you've changed the whole landscape of what
[00:59:35] that what that looks like I you know I have a home gym and one of the ways I keep myself engaged
[00:59:41] is every once in a while I'll be like oh I really really have to have this new piece of equipment
[00:59:46] okay what's my goal all right I'm gonna structure some sort of silly little goal for myself
[00:59:51] and when I reach that goal I'm gonna get that product I'm gonna get that thing and now I have like
[00:59:55] this new fun thing to play with and so I think not making the the word discipline a dirty thing but
[01:00:02] make it like this happy engaging thing that has associated rewards with it yeah I love that make
[01:00:08] you know change the environment of of the of where you're performing the unpleasant act and try to
[01:00:16] make it as pleasant as possible it's certainly you know it's hard to feel depressed if you're
[01:00:21] throwing your shoulders back and you look up and you or even easier it's hard to be depressed while
[01:00:27] that's pretty easy but it's hard to be depressed if you're feeling grateful about something and so
[01:00:31] you know while I'm feeling depressed I'm not grateful okay well if you were grateful about something
[01:00:35] what might that be you certainly have something you have to be grateful about okay that okay now
[01:00:39] come up with another thing and another thing and another thing yeah it's past it yeah now go do the
[01:00:43] tasks that's really hard exactly and sometimes start simple like like hey I'm grateful because I'm
[01:00:50] on this side of the of the dirt yeah like let's start there I'm thankful I'm grateful that I can
[01:00:56] take a deep breath and then you just you you build on I'm thankful that I have a beautiful safe home
[01:01:04] environment I'm thankful that I have food in my refrigerator it's just start really simple and
[01:01:09] then build them there and and again like I think if you add some body movement and some music it's
[01:01:17] it's really easy for us to download its viral you know you should have a deal blowing up you have
[01:01:22] you know clients pulling out you have like a lot of bad stuff but you can go back and re re-calibrate
[01:01:28] yourself our brains can't you cannot focus on being depressed and immensely grateful at the same time
[01:01:34] it can't like the the wiring those different parts of the brain yeah it's a totally different part
[01:01:39] of the brain and just go back to what like I'm grateful for this opportunity it's a learning
[01:01:44] opportunity and it's a challenge but I'm grateful that I'm having this moment right now because
[01:01:48] I'm going to learn something what can I learn and then it's you change your reframing your
[01:01:53] perspective on that that event which sometimes it's really hard perfectly said well

And now on to our show. Today's episode is brought to you by corded.io. Are you looking for agents to join your brokerage or team? Now as a real estate recruiter, I can tell you the answer is always yes. But most agents aren't looking to move right now. So how do you know who to contact? Well, what if I were to tell you there's a recruiting and retention tool powered by artificial intelligence that shows you exactly which agents in your local market are looking to leave their brokerage right now. And which agents at your own firm are also looking to leave you. Now, I've been recruiting real tours for 15 years and I've hired over 2,000 agents. I can tell you with no exaggeration. This is the tool I've been waiting for. Corded's AI looks for trends across dozens of variables for each agent in your market and shows you which agents they believe are likely to move. Not only does it do that, but corded's AI went and visited my recruiting website and read everything I offer. So now when I'm recruiting, corded's AI tells me exactly what to say based on that agent's needs and what my brokerage can offer. It even writes emails for me. I've never seen anything like it and I use it every single day. Now, if you are looking to grow your brokerage, corded.io is the best tool out there. Visit corded.io to schedule a demo again. That's corded.io. And now onto the show. Hello and welcome to another episode of Keeping It Real, the largest podcast made by real estate agents and four real estate agents. My name is DJ Paris. I am your guide and host through the show. And in just a moment, we're going to be speaking with top producer Sean Conkler before we get to Sean. And by the way, this episode is amazing because not only is Sean a top producing agent, he is also a student of top producers in the business.

Leave us a review. Let us know what you think of the show and support our sponsors. They are so wonderful and help keep this whole machine running. All right, guys, let's get to it. My conversation with Sean Conkler. Today, my guest is Sean Conkler with Compass in San Francisco. He is part of Homeward Associates. And let me tell you more about Sean. So he's an East Coast native who traded Connecticut winners for California, sunny skies in his early 20s. And Sean has cultivated a deep love for Northern California and all that his community provides. Mastering the art of customer success in his previous career, he pivoted from luxury athletic clubs into the real estate realm in 2017 and is not look back. Serving the same discerning bake area clientele, Sean has honed his keynability to anticipate clients, individual needs and identify the right course of action to achieve success driven by a strong desire to help others put down roots in the beloved community. He calls home his passion for real estate is possible. It is evident in the way he thoughtfully guides clients through the home buying process advocating every step of the way we should mention San Francisco, not barrier rather, not the easiest market to be a REALTOR in as we probably all know. So I love talking to agents that are really, you know, doing well out there. I just, who scares me to even think about trying something like that. He's also an accomplished martial artist and publish author the motor. He's also motorcycle enthusiast and he loves riding up the coast visiting museums and hiking Bay area trails on the weekend. I want everybody. Oh, and he's a podcast host. When everybody to check out his podcast. It's very similar to this one in the sense that he talks to top producers.

You'll find them and follow him on Instagram. Sean underscore concler K1K LER will have links to all this in the show note. Sean, welcome. Thank you. I'm so happy to be here. This is going to be fun. I am so well, this is light lifting day for me because you are a podcast host. So no pressure, but you can you know, the lot of a lot of the interesting stuff is going to come from you because you're used to having interesting conversations with agents. But I always like to start actually before we get started, I have a question for you. And I apologize. I usually tell guests about this head of time. I didn't this time. So I apologize for that. But I think you'll be able to handle it, which is what's the best piece of advice you ever received? You know, from 2017 on about, you know, being an agent. What was the best piece of advice you received? Wow. That is a great question right out of the gate. What's the best piece of advice? I want to say, it's funny. My brain is going in 20 different directions. But I think the best piece of advice that I ever received was wherever you're at in your career. Let's say you're one to going into year two or year 10 going into 11 is talk to people who are successful and ask them specifically what they did. And so I would say surround yourself with highly successful people and then ask them what they specifically did at that specific threshold. That's really, really great advice. I always like to say that I'm not going to be able to do that. I always love, it's always the fundamentals, right? And that is such a great fundamental thing that we should all be doing. And also, you know, asking those people slightly above, like, how do you, how do you get from here to there? And finding out what those tasks are probably the same tasks, you know, that you do now. And what's one bad piece of advice that you've received as an agent? I think it's, you know, it's twofold. It's I had a really amazing principal when I was in high school. And he always said consider the source. And so like if you were getting negative feedback from somebody or like someone who's picking on you would be like consider the source. And I think when you qualify advice and then you really consider the source, the reality is you only have a couple mentors, but a lot of people, everybody's going to give you advice. And figure out what that person's really great at. And if they're not, then I probably want to take their advice. Yeah, I think that's very wise. Wise way, consider the source. That's great. Wow, that is fantastic. Well, thank you again for being on our show. I would love to get to know you a bit better and find out how you got from the East Coast to the West Coast. So tell us about previously in, you know, you were in the luxury athletic club business and then, you know, making this the shift how why wear tell me give me this specifics. Oh God, that was almost two decades ago. So it was quite a while ago. I was, yeah, I grew up in the burbs and I grew up in a town that was very, it was a factory town, my dad owned a factory. And I grew up working in his machine shop and learning the inner workings of that. And I realized that, well, it's a great path. It just wasn't for me. It wasn't my DNA and I really wanted to, I wanted to do more and different. Simultaneously, I was a really insecure and scared kid. And so I realized that I need to just get in front of more people to overcome that, that fear that I had. And I had an opportunity to do sales and I was about, I want to say 18 years old. And I, my, my ex works for a motorcycle seat company and they were hosting a huge event. And I went to the event and it was a three day events and it was basically selling seats and installing them. And we had a dinner at the close of the event. And the president stood up and there was, you know, the senior VPs and the VPs and the regional directors and all these people and he's like, I want to basically share what happened in the weekend and blah, blah, blah. And he like goes through and he's like, the top two sales people. He was the number one, the president and number two was me. And I had never done sales before and that's where I got my taste. Simultaneously, I, you know, I grew up in a small town and I realized going to New York on weekends and hanging out in Boston that there was just something about a city. And wanting to do more, wanting to figure out this different new space. I was always enthralled with martial arts. I remember as a kid like laying on the couch, I had bad asthma and I, it'd be like the weekend and I'd watch like Kung Fu Marathons and I was just, I loved it. I don't know what it was about it, but I loved it. And so, you know, as I got a little bit older and started to figure out things, I realized one, I wanted to live in a city and two. I really wanted to study martial arts and going to New York and realizing they have the same weather patterns as can. And I was like, you know, I really want to go to a different hub somewhere else. And I had a pen pal growing up who lived in San Francisco and I learned tidbits about it. And I think it was four months later, we moved sight unseen. Amazing. And here you are. So what I, what I love about what, what you do is obviously you are in, you're doing something I am, I don't do, which is I am not out there in the trenches selling. So you are, which I very much admire. And on top of that, you also have this great podcast. And you're talking to other successful agents. So you're giving back to the industry. And I think that's unbelievable as well. So, you know, tell us a little bit about why do you decide to start the podcast. Great question. So I, when I was building my, my real estate team, I had a business coach and we the very first steps were, it was a business coach, not a real estate coach because you know, real estate coach is not all of them, but they tend to do a lot of blocking and tackling. You need to make more calls, you need to do more of this and you hear the scripts and I didn't want that I wanted business help and advice. And so we started down the path of what culture are you looking to build with your team, what's your mission. And the mission statement was from JFK, a rising tide lifts all boats. And in that, the spirit of that carried over into the podcast of, I really wanted to spend time with top, top, top. performers and learn firsthand what they're doing. And with that, how can I do that and do what I enjoy, which is learning and talking to really amazing people. And simultaneously lift the bar for the industry. And it just kind of, it evolved and it evolved out of my curiosity and my passions, if you will. Yeah, it's amazing. It's not easy to start a podcast and I've been there and I've continued to be there and I know just how challenging it is. And I also know how much fun it is to talk to top producers and find out what they're doing and share their success with others. And I know that you've got a hundred hours of interviews under your belt, which is again an amazing accomplishment. And I never have counted the number of hours I've done, but I imagine, you know, if I would have thought when I got to 100, whenever that was, that would have been a nice thing to celebrate. So I appreciate you acknowledging that I'm sort of the person that never quite knows how many how many episodes he's done or or what what our numbers are at. But I do love talking to top producers and it's something that if I were an agent or well, I technically am, but I don't practice if I were practicing it. Then I think I would still continue to do this because it is so exciting to hear top agents and you know, just sort of by sheer immersion being around people that are doing these things. You know, the the fundamentals get repeated the sort of special techniques get repeated. You know, there isn't typically a lot and I'm curious to get your perspective of, hey, I've got this secret sort of strategy that most people don't know occasionally I do hear that and that's fun. For the most part, it's I just practice the fundamentals over and over and over again and I work, you know, diligently to make sure that I treat this thing like a business and I structure my day and you know, all of the things that that agents will tell us. And yet it seems so hard for so many agents to do that. And so I think, you know, just being a producing agent yourself, you know, this is probably just great reminders of every single time you talk to a top producer like, oh yeah, this is what I what I'm doing as well. I completely agree. Yeah, it's I think there's a great quote and I want to say it's socrates and it's learning is remembering and you know, more often than not we know we know how to have be healthy. We know how to have a healthy business. We know how to do budgets and things like that. We just stop doing it. We get distracted in our days and our lives and we we don't do it or we, you know, we just you know, it's, you know, what's one little piece of cake. And then you can do that one little piece of cake more and more and and suddenly you're you're at a different different place. And so yeah, I think the podcast is the the experience I've had. It's twofold. It's the reminder to keep doing this thing and then it's I'm always looking for that one nugget. What's the what's that one thing that I can not change in my business but improve what we're doing by 1% and if I can improve it just 1% every day. That's a radical change at the end of the year and of two years at the end of 10 years. It's a completely different direction that you're traveling in. Yeah, it's that metaphor of what what's not even a metaphor. It's what pilots do right. They think if they're off by even a half a degree, you know, pretty soon it's not even close to where they're where you want to land. So there's the self correcting mechanism of always sort of staying on the path, which is doing doing all of those, you know, sort of habits, you know, for for lack of a better term these these habits that we want to cultivate that ultimately continue to reinforce, you know, us pressing down that path and it's hard because the most brokerages don't have a structure in place because while you're not an employee at most brokerages. So you are kind of left to your own devices. You can't really be told to do a certain number of hours or a certain number of activities other than compliance, you know, and it can be very isolating. I think to be a REALTOR it can be it can be tricky. Many agents aren't working in offices these days. So it feels even maybe more singular and individual and it's look, you know, we we are not always able to do everything ourselves. And I think this idea of community is so important and I love that you're creating that with your podcast. I've certainly felt that we've built some version of that here. And I want to I want to talk about you practicing because moving out to San Francisco again one of the toughest markets. If not maybe the number one or number two toughest markets to not only purchase real estate, but to be real estate agent because of course the price points are so high. It's such an attractive occupation. If you can get those land those deals because obviously a lot there's a lot of revenue there. And yet it seems to me to be gosh. I don't know how anyone gets business with so many agents and I've talked to a lot of San Francisco agents and you know obviously they figured out. So I'd love to hear from you about how you made that transition and how you started growing about growing that your your own business. Yeah, it's it's a spicy market. That's for sure. There's to give context San Francisco is only seven by seven miles. Yeah. And so the footprint of San Francisco is smaller than Disney's parking lot. Mind blowing, right. And within that there's about roughly 6000 practicing agents. And so to your point, the competition is fierce and the price points are high. The price points. The opening price point is luxury in most other markets for a two bedroom condo. And so it's tricky. But you know similar to the podcast is I figured out if you if you hang out with the right with successful people virtue of osmosis it rubs off. And then simultaneously if you if you hang out where successful buyers and sellers are those conversations are naturally going to come up. So I had a teacher in school who always would joke and say you don't go elephant hunting in a bar. Right. You have to you have to go to where the elephants are is really what it what it comes down to. And so I very early on I realized I took the city and I kind of you know broke it up and figured out what section of the city do I want to really cut my teeth in and then two fold what brokerage was doing the most transactions in that area. And then who were the those top agents doing it. And then I hung around those agents I would go to their open houses and just introduce myself and say hi and talk to them. And eventually I won the trust of a very prolific agent who didn't have a team. And I was given the amazing opportunity to host one of her open houses and it was on the north side of the city it was a 2.5 million dollar property. And I would show up 20 minutes early and I would put like six six of my signs out. And I would text her when I got there early I would bring a broom and I would sweep the street in front I would clean up the house I would let her know if anything was was off or needed refilling and I would just take care of it and I would let her know that I'm taking care of it. And through that she not only gave me a ton of those open houses but then it parlayed into other open houses. And from doing that and being consistent and doing that I I feel like I got really lucky but I think luck always meets hard work and I met a guy who had to move he was on a very tight time crunch he had cash in my first transaction in the city was for 2.6. Wow and I was like blown away another couple who I met at that property I've got them into contract a couple months later for 1.8 and it my business transformed literally overnight but it it didn't it you know it started with me choosing the right brokerage and then choosing to be around those the right people and then going in not just doing a good job at these open houses but doing such a noteworthy job for me. So I was like I was going to go to the office for that agent to make that agent looks so good in front of their client I would send her these reports that were a page long with bullet points of what time I arrived what time I left what the weather was like who were the parties who came through who was their agent I would hyperlink the agents. I made it so darn easy for her that she couldn't say no when I when I said hey do you have any other open house opportunities and eventually she said here's the spreadsheet of all my properties all the dates are in there put your name under anyone's you want to host and that's that's how it's just snowballs for me and it's just a really quick clip. I wish all of our audience to really really go back and listen to shunt all that story over and over and over again because it is the story that I have heard over and over again doing this podcast I cannot tell you you probably have heard it as well is this beg plead and and earn a top producer you know or any producer really say I I want to I want to do this you know I want to do open house. I want to do open house and what what do I need to do to earn that trust you know and like you said make it really easy for them to want you back you know and boy you know they're getting reports I mean who sends reports you know almost nobody probably you know to to the other listing agent and yet you know yeah I I'd see boy what what an amazing what an amazing opportunity for you and and for everyone thinking open houses don't work they work if you were if you know what you're doing and if you're you know if my anyway we know they were so wow what a what a wonderful message for the audience this is so smart so you know I would do that you know whatever brokerage you're at look at the other listings from that brokerage in that area and let's start talking to those top agents or any agent and saying hey I want to get better open houses and here's my plan that I I want to do does this meet your standards Mr. Mrs. broker is this what you're looking for in an open house and if not help me fill in the blanks and let's let me go do this for you and prove to you that I'm going to make you look amazing to the neighborhood and the sellers and who doesn't want to look amazing to the client right so exactly what a wonderful suggestion so thank you for for that again it's it's so fundamental and yet it is so easily ignored and it takes courage to ask a top producer to let you show their you know several billion dollar listing that is not an easy ask because of course they're like why would I give that to you well eventually you like Sean said he goes I earned my way into that you know probably wasn't the very first time he asked you probably I imagine you you probably had to you know demonstrate that you had the the competency to do something like that yeah I mean I you know it's we've all heard you know with with clients you they have to know you like you then trust you and it's it's not just similar it's the same formula for agents and I remember this agent who didn't know me from from anybody else I went to her open house I introduced myself I saw she was busy I just said hi I wanted to introduce myself I'm Sean like let me know if you ever need anything happy to help left when I was leaving I saw that her sign on the corner had blown over and so I stood it back up I took a photo and I said hey you're signed on the corner blew over I leaned it up so it wouldn't fall over again and then that was it and and but I sent it with an image and I remember she thanked me and so it's it's those it's the little things and and you know it's it's now they they kind of know you're looking out right you're you're aware and it's it's you're getting on the you get on the radar first and then you just build from there it's the same I think for agents recruiting for agents wanting to get in front of top performers to do open houses to get in front of clients it's the same formula treat everybody like a client follow up with them check in with them see how they're doing and don't ask permission to be supportive just be supportive and I've I have found from doing that good good things come from it and just I think simultaneously you know do things without expectation just just do good work just do really good workout there good work usually ends up winning because there's not in abundance of good work in in most industries and most professions and and even within sometimes most offices so I think this this idea of elevating 1% you know that making a 1% doable we can do 1% I can get better at my listing presentation 1% or my you know open house or my customer care calls or whatever you know we can do we can do one 100% that's hard 1% we can do that and then sure enough after after a few months it's you are at 100% probably even though technically you know you're just making these incremental changes but all the sudden big big things start shifting so I want to chat with you because you've talked to so many top agents and I know you have sort of these three items of that you find or strategies or techniques that agents are using really successful ones so I'd love for you to share that with our audience. Yeah it's interesting it's it's kind of you know everything is very Yin and Yang push and pull and the simultaneously if you do the right things you tend to stop doing the wrong things right if you want to start eating healthier and your caloric intake is all healthy food it leaves less room for unhealthy food right and if you allocate time to work out you have led less time to sit around on the couch eating ice cream and so a business is not dissimilar so if you just tend to stop doing the things that don't work and do more of the things that work you successful come from it and so the three are are more or less the what you shouldn't be doing but baked in that is what you should be doing and so I call them the the tourist the racehorse and the ping pong and I've been I love it the and I did it in this way because the way our brains work is we remember stories and they're easier to remember and so if you just visualize a a racehorse and a ping pong and a tourist they will these these things will make sense and and so the tourist years and years ago I worked at the Kung Fu school and I was running the schools the federation had quarters and I was under a lot of stress and pressure and I'm trying to run a business and I would have instructors call out all the time and so I'm running a business and I'm teaching 16 classes a week and burning out and I burnt out is is really what happened and I I wound up calling a friend and we were talking and he just sold this business and had obviously some good proceeds and he's like we should just take a trip and I was like that sounds like a great idea and so I submitted my resignation and we booked the trip to Italy for a month and we landed in Milan and the best part was we had a flight in and we had a flight out when we had one month and we had zero place to be and so we would literally get up in the morning look at a map and go okay we can go here and if if we're gonna flip a coin if it lands on heads we'll go here and if we flip a tail so we'll go here and we would literally flip a coin to figure out where to go fun fact there's a villa villa conchlor up near Venice I didn't get to go see it but it's on my it's on my to-do list and and so we had this meandering adventure of just literally flipping a coin of what to do every day and so the spirit of that and how that relates to business is if you have no plan that is your plan and and thus the agents who don't have a plan they tend to just wake up in the morning flip a coin and whatever it lands on they tend to do and so they don't do anything with with a plan and the agents who are succeeding on a very high level they have a very clear plan they know where they're going and they know the strategies to get them there and so my advice would be to not be the tourist is really what it summarizes down to and and have a business plan and more importantly I have found from working with agents who I've recruited to the team is have a one-page business plan if if you can't get it down distilled into one page you are never ever ever going to execute on it but more importantly you have to revisit it you have to sit with it every Monday and look at it and figure out last week did I do the tasks to move towards this plan and it's not one of these at the end of the years you set it and then forget it and then you re-look at it next year and you said oh we missed or we hit great job that's that's not how you use it and so having a really concise plan is is what's going to carry you to success so don't be the tourist but be the almost gosh you know I don't know the tip the the the opposite of tourists is but but certainly somebody who knows exactly what they're a pilot a pilot you know to go back to your analogy of flying you know a plane flying from New York to San Francisco is off course 90 percent of the time the pilot's goal is to keep keep it course corrected that's that's their goal and so within that there's no failures the the pilot didn't fail because they need to course correct it was an outcome and they had an outcome they didn't want so they changed it to have the outcome they do want and so having the mindset of their their aren't failures there's outcomes and stop doing the outcomes that are giving you what you know want and start doing more of the ones that are giving you what you do want yeah yeah that makes perfect sense um so yeah I agree it's talking about attentionality right it's the idea of instead of being reactive and it's so easy to be reactive but it can feel so productive to be reactive things that come at us come in or inbox or text and phone calls and we can just spend all day you know batting the balls back and forth that are hit coming out our way and certainly we have to do that and we also need to have a time where it's like no from this time to this time I'm doing this other thing and this other thing is to help me course correct so that I'm not just batting you know the customer service uh you know balls all day long you know I have to be prospecting I have to be you know nurturing my database and so those are the things that yeah they're they're not as easy to get started and also they're sometimes not as much fun right that's the other part is that it isn't necessarily the most pleasurable tasks that are the most um profitable right and so that's the other thing is we we think we also have to really get comfortable with the idea that discomfort is is the part probably the pay you know the the name of the game is how do we stay in discomfort healthy discomfort you know discomfort that's leading us to where we want to go and that's not easy to to step into that because you have to be willing to stand in the in the way of a bit of misery um and misery is the path and because through misery you you know you get stronger and you get better and and it's and then all the sudden you're out of the misery and you're you're reaping the rewards but misery is the place you gotta you gotta be willing to step into and it's it's not a it's not a fun lesson to hear and I wish there was another way you know it relates to working out right you go to the gym and then your sore that's discomfort but you you earn that discomfort that's good discomfort because tomorrow when you show up your body's healing it's growing it's changing and you're stronger and so that thing that made you discomfort are uncomfortable in the beginning no longer makes you uncomfortable and that's our brains are actually wired like that the more that you do something that's uncomfortable that part of your brain actually gets stronger and so the next time you do it it's not as uncomfortable that's why you know you see these amazing public speakers on stage in their charismatic and charming engaging with with with everybody or your podcast there's no way your first podcast was as good as the one you you're your last six I eliminated it for my memory because it was so bad mine too I go back and I look at the first one and I was like oh my god this was painful but I got more and more comfortable and I'm sure now you don't think about who's listening you focus on the conversation and you you kind of stay in the moment and but you got there by doing that uncomfortable thing so many times that it doesn't I'm sure you don't get jitters anymore you don't get the butterflies you just you're like all right I know what to do let's go like this is amazing this can be fun and it's it's the same with all the aspects of our business I agree and I would also add to that to keep me honest that you know it's like you're going back to your workout metaphor so every time I go to the gym you know for example if I have to do a wall sit something that I'm not a fan of doing I don't like that exercise it's not enjoyable for me none of the exercises are enjoyable but that is one of the least enjoyable ones it hurts I have to hold it it's this isometric exercise that I go basically almost until failure so I'm almost like collapsing and yet that's the path because that's how muscles get torn apart and they rebuild stronger and then to keep my keep me honest is yes the next time maybe maybe that particular amount of time is is easier but that means I have to do more to make it even harder and I have to keep doing that to ratchet up to keep growing and so you know back to this podcast yeah I don't get jitters but what am I working on to make this even better for the players and the truth is that yeah I could kind of phone it in because I've done it long enough and I'm sure there's times where I have if I you know if I'm being perfectly honest yeah and I don't want to do that and I want to keep growing so it's always this consistent you know we return to discomfort that again I wish it wasn't that way I wish we just didn't have to but it seems to be rewarded it's rewarded by society it's rewarded by ourselves it's rewarded just it you know by industry so again it's it's never the message I want to hear you know well said I mean and I appreciate the reframe is you're right like we even if you you have figured out even if you got the wall sit for 15 seconds now it's 16 yeah and then it's 17 then it's 18 and then eventually it's like two minutes three minutes and you're like oh my god this is crazy you're right you're absolutely right you do need you need that continuous growth and that's where when we're growing as humans that's when we're typically the happiest it's 100% those those really challenging experiences in our lives are usually that that moment after was the biggest growth we've had yeah I totally agree and I just thought came to me that I wanted to toss in which is while I'm doing for example the wall sit and it's that you know higher level that I did from the previous day doing it or the previous time I have to be you know I said this to my trainer a year or two ago I said oh I'm never gonna feel strong when I'm working out and she goes that is correct no matter how strong you actually are you will never feel strong working out if you work out more right away and so it's kind of that that willingness to be like oh I'm not going I'm always going to feel like there's another level to achieve you know and and that to me is how really successful agents do it it's not that they're down on themselves or they think they're worthless or they you know that I don't think is a good idea I think shame really shuts us down but if we can say hey here's where I'm at here's where I want to be and I'm always gonna strive to get just a little bit one percent that one percent better I think is such a good message I'm so glad you shared that because that's something we can we can jump on do but we have to be willing to go what what's the discomfort that that one percent is going to entail and I'm gonna have to sit with it but I'm gonna have pride at the end of that I'm going to also probably have results and and it's going to just you know continue to to further my growth okay tell us about the ping pong I'd love to hear so we talked about tourist and being the pilot as opposed to the tourist tell us about ping pong the ping pong is you know this is a pattern that I've seen with with agents who kind of started to figure it out and I've done it myself and my career is the ping pong is you start doing that thing that really works for you and then you become really successful in doing that one thing but then you also become very busy so then you recede from doing that one thing and then the business and then you're like shoot shoot shoot I don't have any sales I don't have a pipeline so then you go back to doing that one thing or you try something new and then that thing doesn't work so then you try something else and that doesn't work and then you go back to the thing that works and you're like wow this really works you you do that thing a ton of times now you're again busy and successful and you stop doing that thing and so your your business ricochets from having abundance to scarcity and back and forth and back and forth and that really genuinely relates to systems and processes and no one wants to talk about it because it's not sexy but they don't have the system in the process of consistently doing that thing to gain new new contacts and then having the system to follow up what's what's the actual workflow after that and then again going out and doing that activity again say the open house is and then collecting those names I can't even tell you how many agents are amazing I'll use open houses as an example they're amazing at collecting the names and then they're like well the person didn't respond so yeah they're their tire kickers or you know look he lose or whatever they are and I hate both of those phrases and it's like well how many times did you follow up well I sent them an email yeah and you're like well how many times once and so it's like you need to system on the back end to you to do it more than once in the reality is marketing statistically we need to hear about something seven to nine times before we actually engage with it so the math is the reality is you're going to have to meet 100 people to have a 2% conversion meaning two closes 100 people to have two closes and you're going to have to follow up with 100 people north of seven times yeah and most people don't have that system in place and so their business tends to ping pong is sadly what happens and they also don't have the willingness and again I'm not I this you know there before the grace of God go I so I am not I am not dissimilar from this but they don't have the willingness to say I'm not going to see the result on the third call in fact if I do it's a fluke right on the third text the third phone call the third email if they somehow are like let's start working together I just got real lucky because it's really going to take right probably even more than than seven to nine touches you know it might be 30 but this idea of I'm going to earn this I'm going to earn this just like you earned your way into you know to some open houses you have to earn it and you know other sometimes you get lucky and those are the ones that probably hurt people the most because they're so yeah they're they're so fun easy win the easy win you know like oh this is easy I only need to do it one time but you know to go back to the the whole gym is how many times have you how many people in the world have gone into a gym one time had an amazing workout and they're like they look into me and like wow I'm fit for life yeah never happens you have to go back but not only go back you have to go back consistently over time and just because you get on the scale and it's the same number that doesn't mean that your body's not redoing a decomposition meaning your body fat is going down but your muscle is going up and so the scale is exactly the same and so just because you don't see the difference based on what you're measuring it doesn't mean you're not getting the results and I think that's you know you have that one easy hit you get that you you know you meet that client at the open house and they write the offer on that property then you get lazy you don't build the muscle and and so the muscle really is develops through the practice of the follow up and it's not it's it's not a pass fail just because they didn't respond that doesn't mean you failed you're just practicing your follow up and then within the practice practice different follow ups and and never open an email this is like the ban my existence never open an email with them just following up I hate that yeah because you're fishing instead listen to whatever the conversation was and then don't say I'm following up but follow up with a piece of information that is then valuable to what they're wanting or needing if you met them at a three bedroom and it wasn't a good fit for them hey can you imagine yourself living here now you know what we really need a second bath and you were able to collect the email well then your follow up should be hey I wanted to check in I know this property wasn't a good fit because x y and z but I found this other one that's off market and it is did you want to hear more information about it yeah it's great it's it's this I was thinking about you here's something that you might want and letting that be the guiding star versus you know I have to check this you know this is my fourth email so I have to just keep keep keep bugging you until eventually you break down and go okay let's talk and you know maybe that works I don't know I don't suspect it works very well I think this providing value and going back to you know you're talking about ping pong versus systems or versus habits you know I might even say habits because habits are like okay I got I got the you know the easy win and now I got to go back and make all my dials and I have to go continue to you know do my customer service and I have to you know it's just consistently running running the the same playbook and making adjustments when necessary of course but just you know I talked to a top producer just last week and she I said what do you get just like you're saying what are you doing right after this because I always love to hear what top producers do during the day she goes oh I have to make like an hour and a half of phone calls and I said oh okay like what kind she goes oh they're my prospecting calls I do it every single day she's been in 20 years in the business love I said I said really and she said I have to she goes I don't it's the ping pong effect you know I'll be busy for a while and then I won't be she's like I can't not keep my pipeline full so and and I suspect she doesn't get you know a huge hit rate on those phone calls but she knows that that's the that's how you earn your way into somebody's into somebody's business you know again it goes back to out of a hundred people that you know that's in your database only 2% are going to convert that's just sales statistics only 2% and so 98 of those phone calls are they're not they're not useless they're future business because not only that each person knows 3 other people who are thinking about making a move later that year and so that's the gold and and and just you know out it's and I always use this word very carefully I used it earlier when we said but we don't make time like you can't make time it's if that's an impossibility but you can allocate time to do the thing and and in those top performers they always allocate time and think they they also live by another rule if you have to erase it you must replace it you have to put it somewhere else on your calendar and and that's you know the calendars another ping pong is the top performers and I'm sure you've seen this with your podcast all the top performers use a calendar and they all show up when they have to be there the I can always tell when I'm doing a podcast recording who's not a top performer just virtue of the emails that I get hey are we still on for Friday hey I don't see the link here it's like they're missing all of the cues along the way yeah yeah they don't have systems and there he is you know I do I had this thought and I I don't think this is our listeners so please I'm not talking to you the listener but other people that maybe aren't listening I think there's a lot of REALTORS maybe the majority of them that don't actually keep a calendar I I don't mean top performers they all do but I mean everybody else I suspect I think there's people in my personal life who are who are not REALTORS who don't keep a calendar I maybe they just have amazing memories I don't know but I certainly don't so I I have to structure every hour of the day pretty much and that doesn't mean I don't make adjustments we all do but I at least try to figure out what am I doing today and what time and I have to write it down because I won't remember but same I I cannot rely my memory at all and so our listing process for example there's a hundred and seven steps there's a hundred and seven steps because I cannot remember when we have four listings what if that one report was ordered for this specific property so the when you have systems and processes those three AM wake up panics don't happen anymore because there's a place for everything and everything's in its place yeah and you know it's a good reminder for me to tighten up some of my systems as well because that's that is a good if you are having those Sunday scaries or whatever day of the week that is for you it's you know I love that phrase yeah I didn't come up with it it's it's it's kind of out there in the in the vernacular now but I it's such so perfect because I know I know that feeling it's probably because I haven't tightened up my process and I haven't created a repeatable system so yeah let's talk about racehorse so we have we had tourist we have ping pong don't be a ping pong you know making sure that you're consistent with your with your disciplined habits and now tell us about racehorse yeah so you got to have a plan is the is the first thing and then you have this you have to have a system to execute the plan and now the racehorse the racehorse if you ever been to a racetrack when I turned 30 my friends all decided to take me to the racetrack which was super fun we all like put on suits in the women wars sunglasses and it was just like this just such a cool event but what's interesting is these racehorse is they have a goal right so they have the they're not the tourists they start at the start line and they their their goal is the finish line and not only that to finish first but the fascinating part is every horse has blinders on and so now the jockey's goal is to keep the horse doing its job and the blinders are now to keep the horse from getting distracted because if the horse doesn't have them and they focus on the horse that left the horse on the right is going to pass and if they're focused on the horse on the right the horse on the left is going to pass so they have blinders to keep from getting distracted and so then they can only focus on that one goal and I I feel that because we have the autonomy to do whatever we want with our day we don't put blinders on ourselves we don't have the discipline and we tend to just get distracted we sit in these meetings and we hear you know Joan over here is doing X, Y and Z and you're like I should be doing that and then so you introduce more ping pongs now you don't have one ping pong now you got two and then you're like well Mike over here is doing this thing so now let me bring in another ping pong and so now we've made ourselves really busy we don't have a system to implement these ping pongs and then we are now chasing more and more ping pongs and getting less and less results and so it really boils down to you is you got to have a plan you got to have the systems but then you got to stay focused and it's distractions that are really killing the business and those agents who are succeeding on an eye level they have those blinders on and you know even going back to agents leverage social media how many set a timer to focus on lead generation on social media but instead they actually just turn it into a scroll fast and then the next thing you know two hours went by and they're looking at like pictures of puppies yeah and and so really having the discipline in your in your day to say hey I'm doing this thing right now and I'm not going to be distracted by it one of the simple things that we do is with the podcast great example is when I launched it I decided that we're going to have a goal of of X amount of months and the goal is to get somebody subscribers or downloads and then so we won't measure anything until that point and within that I need to have enough budget allocated for that project and then I need to figure out who is going to execute what because I don't have time to add more ping pongs my schedule is already full and so now I have to figure out how to get some of these things off my plate and that's the pre-planning to a strategy whatever your marketing strategy is is having having the plan to it deciding things on the whim right not referring to your business plan is kind of the kiss of death it's kind of like you know being a tourist in the gym it's like if you went to the gym and said I don't feel like doing wall sits today but you did that over you know 20 30 40 days your wall sits are not going to get any better and you're not going to develop that core strength because you didn't feel like it that day and so again having the blinders on or the coach the mentor in your back pocket to say hey you really need to this was your plan now you need to execute on it yeah and and having accountability and I think you know that's where like you said coach comes in accountability partner if you can't do a coach you just find another agent look we're all struggling we're all struggling in different ways and so everybody's going to need accountability you know nobody does it all perfectly and getting somebody to help keep you on on task is you know obviously such a great a great thing and it's not a failure I want to make sure if you're thinking boy I I end up doing scrolling or I end up just infinitely scrolling because yeah that's what it's designed to do it's designed to make you do that that's not even your fault but there's a way around it right and that's by having some sort of accountability where maybe you only allow yourself a certain number of minutes you know and and having other other processes in place but yes the hard stuff is hard the hard stuff is hard good well said yeah and I again wish it wasn't boy I it'll be my first question if there is a creator and I get to meet the creator when I when I pass I'll be like why do you make all the good stuff so hard but you probably or he or she will probably say well yeah it's what's supposed to be so so it it just is it's kind of just reality so you know look you know we also I think you know just have to be really careful about technology just capturing our attention when it's it's designed to especially social media is designed to capture our attention because that's how it monetizes so of course it wants you infinitely scrolling like that's the best possible thing you can do for that service and it's tricky because you probably have to post on social media it's kind of like the person with the eating disorder trying to learn how to you know eat it in a non-disorderly way that's not easy because you have to eat so I get that the social media thing is really tricky but if you keep falling into that hole that's where you need to say you know I keep falling into this hole I just have to see find a solution and whether it's you put a timer on your phone that blocks you out or you get somebody to you know just check in with okay for the next half an hour I'm gonna post I'm gonna connect with my audience I'm going to write comments on there you know instead of consuming I'm going to be proactive and do something create content whatever and in 30 minutes I'm gonna call you and I'm gonna tell you how many of these I did you know or whatever whatever the system is you know don't feel ashamed my girlfriend struggles with with infinitely scrolling and she's a super successful executive so it's not and she's one of the most disciplined people I know and she can't hardly do it so and that's how it's designed I mean it's yeah I can be addictive and I think you make a really great point DJ is is to recognize you know to just be very honest with yourself and it's hard to say you know I do scroll too much and I do have a problem with that like at least whatever it is in your business just acknowledge it and then whatever I commend is find a solution is maybe log out every time you are done or delete the app so you have to re upload the app before and then you have to log back in to go do the activity make it a little bit harder a really subtle trick for those watching this podcast is my phone is black and white because the colors make it more attractive to our community receptors so if your phone is black and white it loses the red numbers that jump up on all the apps it's it doesn't have the same appeal to our brain and so the the satisfying part of it goes away and so there's there's tons of little tricks you can get a product like like loomlee for example and you go to that platform and you put all of your social posts in there and then you schedule them to go out so you don't even have to actually physically go to that app yeah and then as a tree this is where you know program the Pavlovian philosophy or strategy comes into play is listen I'm going to sit down for 30 minutes and make past client calls I'm just going to say hey I was thinking about you and wanted to say hi at the end of 30 minutes reward yourself set a timer for 10 minutes and doom scroll yeah create it as you know pain and pleasure create a reward for doing the thing or you know you know let's go back to working out it was I use that because it's easy for me because I did it for the bulk of my life yeah but if you're eating very disciplined for seven days a week months on end you get really it gets really challenging but if you have a cheat day yeah like sun that cheat meal just a cheat meal if a cheat day if you fall off the fall off the you know you fall completely out of cheat day and it just really hurts you the next then make it a cheat meal or two cheat meals or whatever yeah exactly and but you then give yourself the reward or like hey you know like I'm eating really disciplined all week my friends birthdays this weekend I'm going to have French Ryzen beer that just sounds amazing and now it's a reward for the hard work and so it's just it's just creating these it's stepping back and looking like where what area do I want to improve how can I improve it and then how do you how do you change it or maybe you don't like making phone calls maybe that's not your thing but maybe you have a really nice hot tub and you have a cell phone so you know what I'm gonna go put on some cool music I'm gonna go hop in the hot tub I'm gonna fire it up I'm gonna it's a cheat day I'm gonna pour glass of wine and you know what then I'm gonna make my calls yeah what a great experience I think what are you doing I'm you know what I was relaxing in my hot tub and I was just thinking about my past year and I was thinking about how I helped you so buy that home or sell it and I just wanted to say hi and how grateful I am for the opportunity to work with you yes and it's like you've changed the whole landscape of what that what that looks like I you know I have a home gym and one of the ways I keep myself engaged is every once in a while I'll be like oh I really really have to have this new piece of equipment okay what's my goal all right I'm gonna structure some sort of silly little goal for myself and when I reach that goal I'm gonna get that product I'm gonna get that thing and now I have like this new fun thing to play with and so I think not making the the word discipline a dirty thing but make it like this happy engaging thing that has associated rewards with it yeah I love that make you know change the environment of of the of where you're performing the unpleasant act and try to make it as pleasant as possible it's certainly you know it's hard to feel depressed if you're throwing your shoulders back and you look up and you or even easier it's hard to be depressed while that's pretty easy but it's hard to be depressed if you're feeling grateful about something and so you know while I'm feeling depressed I'm not grateful okay well if you were grateful about something what might that be you certainly have something you have to be grateful about okay that okay now come up with another thing and another thing and another thing yeah it's past it yeah now go do the tasks that's really hard exactly and sometimes start simple like like hey I'm grateful because I'm on this side of the of the dirt yeah like let's start there I'm thankful I'm grateful that I can take a deep breath and then you just you you build on I'm thankful that I have a beautiful safe home environment I'm thankful that I have food in my refrigerator it's just start really simple and then build them there and and again like I think if you add some body movement and some music it's it's really easy for us to download its viral you know you should have a deal blowing up you have you know clients pulling out you have like a lot of bad stuff but you can go back and re re-calibrate yourself our brains can't you cannot focus on being depressed and immensely grateful at the same time it can't like the the wiring those different parts of the brain yeah it's a totally different part of the brain and just go back to what like I'm grateful for this opportunity it's a learning opportunity and it's a challenge but I'm grateful that I'm having this moment right now because I'm going to learn something what can I learn and then it's you change your reframing your perspective on that that event which sometimes it's really hard perfectly said well REALTOR 180 is the podcast I want everybody to go check out and subscribe I'll
