[00:01:15] Are you looking for agents to join your brokerage, your team?
[00:01:19] Now, as a real estate recruiter, I can tell you
[00:01:21] the answer is always yes.
[00:01:23] But most agents aren't looking to move right now.
[00:01:26] So how do you know who to contact?
[00:01:28] Well, what if I were to tell you there's a recruiting
[00:01:30] and retention tool powered by artificial intelligence
[00:01:34] that shows you exactly which agents in your local market
[00:01:37] are looking to leave their brokerage right now
[00:01:39] and which agents at your own firm are also looking to leave you?

[00:02:08] So now when I'm recruiting, corded's AI tells me
[00:02:11] exactly what to say based on that agent's needs
[00:02:14] and what my brokerage can offer.

[00:02:48] Hello and welcome to Keeping It Real,
[00:02:51] the largest podcast made by real estate agents and four real estate agents.
[00:02:56] My name is DJ Paris.
[00:02:57] I am your guide and host through the show.
[00:02:59] Today is a very special episode for us here at Keeping It Real.
[00:03:02] We have best selling author, Marissa Caschino,
[00:03:05] and she is a fiction writer and wrote an amazing book
[00:03:08] that everybody needs to read called Best Offer Wins.
[00:03:11] And it is funny, it is dark, it is thrilling.
[00:03:14] If you liked Gone Girl, you're going to love this.
[00:03:17] It's a very big deal.
[00:03:18] It's on all sorts of awards.
[00:03:19] It's won a bunch of awards and it's on all sorts of book lists.
[00:03:22] If we're going to be talking with Marissa
[00:03:24] about how this book came to be, it's her very first novel,
[00:03:27] and she is crushing it.
[00:03:28] And it's even currently being optioned
[00:03:31] for a television deal as well.
[00:03:33] So this is awesome.
[00:03:34] It's our first time interviewing a fiction writer
[00:03:36] talking about the real estate business.
[00:03:38] You will love this book.
[00:03:39] I'm reading it right now and it's so great.
[00:03:42] I love it.
[00:03:42] So check it out, Best Offer Wins on Amazon,
[00:03:45] anywhere you find books, of course.
[00:03:49] And let's just get right to, oh no, before I get to Marissa,
[00:03:52] one last thing, I just built you guys a tool I want you to check out.
[00:03:54] I want you to go to joincal.com forward slash one hyphen thing.
[00:04:02] What is this?
[00:04:03] I built an AI tool to help you with your AI prompts.
[00:04:07] So it basically is going to help you identify the biggest problem right now
[00:04:10] in your real estate practice.
[00:04:12] By the way, this whole tool takes 30 seconds.
[00:04:14] It's super fast.
[00:04:15] You're going to say, here's my biggest problem.
[00:04:17] And it's going to ask you a few quick questions.
[00:04:20] And then it's going to give you an AI prompt
[00:04:22] that you copy and paste into the AI system
[00:04:24] that you are currently using.
[00:04:25] And it is a long prompt.
[00:04:27] This is a big prompt because we know that
[00:04:29] agents really don't often understand how to write great prompts
[00:04:32] to get great results.
[00:04:33] This is going to do that for you totally free.
[00:04:35] My gift to you.
[00:04:36] Please check it out.
[00:04:37] Let me know what you think.
[00:04:38] Joincal.com forward slash one hyphen thing.
[00:04:41] And now under my conversation with Marissa Casino.
[00:04:58] Marissa Casino is our guest today.
[00:05:01] And this is a real departure for us.
[00:05:03] The first kind of episode we've done like this in close to,
[00:05:07] well, over 700 episodes now.
[00:05:09] But she is the author.
[00:05:10] In fact, I will tell you how I became aware of you.
[00:05:12] We received, and you don't know this.
[00:05:15] I don't think.
[00:05:16] And I'm going to introduce you in just a moment.
[00:05:18] But we received a anonymous, we sent book in the mail.
[00:05:24] That was to our office here.
[00:05:27] And we occasionally because of my podcast,
[00:05:30] I get sent books.
[00:05:32] And there's usually information about it.
[00:05:34] Or it's for a guest I'm going to be having on the show.
[00:05:36] And in this case, there wasn't that.
[00:05:38] Or maybe there was in that part got thrown away before I got handed to me.
[00:05:41] But I got handed this novel.
[00:05:44] And I thought, oh, this is cool.
[00:05:46] And then we realized, oh, this is probably a marketing thing.
[00:05:50] They're sending it to real estate companies or real estate brokerages.
[00:05:53] And I saw this and I said, I have to have Marissa the author on our show.
[00:05:58] So I want to introduce you to Marissa.
[00:06:01] This is again, a complete change for us.
[00:06:03] We're normally interviewing top agents.
[00:06:04] But now we're interviewing.
[00:06:05] I top best selling author.
[00:06:07] Marissa, she is the author of Best Offer Wins.
[00:06:10] Which by the way, isn't just a book that we has a great title that we think our audience would love.
[00:06:16] But she is also a legitimately credited author.
[00:06:20] She is a good morning America book club pick.
[00:06:23] So GMA says this is the book to read.
[00:06:25] She's also, by the way, not just a best selling author.
[00:06:29] She's in development right now with Hulu for a TV series about this exact topic.
[00:06:34] And other things too, she's a big deal.
[00:06:37] This is, she's previously a journalist.
[00:06:38] Most recently at Washington Post also a very big deal.
[00:06:42] She spent the bulk of her career at Washingtonian magazine, which is a citywide magazine writing long form features overseeing the real estate at home design coverage.
[00:06:51] She's worked with a lot of agents.
[00:06:53] She grew up near Seattle graduating from University of Washington with degree in journalism and polypsi.
[00:06:59] She now lives in DC area where there are husband two dogs, two cats.
[00:07:02] I also have two cats.

[00:07:41] So link in the show notes.
[00:07:42] Marissa, welcome to the show.
[00:07:44] Wow. Well, thank you.
[00:07:45] That is quite a welcome.
[00:07:46] I don't think anyone has given me an introduction like that other than my own mother, probably.
[00:07:50] But thank you so much.
[00:07:52] It's wonderful to be here.
[00:07:54] Everybody's a best selling author except they're not really.
[00:07:56] And you actually are.
[00:07:57] So I am very excited.
[00:08:00] And I wanted to give you the proper respect that this novel deserves.
[00:08:05] And also congratulations on being your debut novel and having such a.
[00:08:11] Really lightning in a bottle sort of situation.
[00:08:14] So, you know, good luck.
[00:08:17] And we're really excited to see your trajectory and follow your your career.
[00:08:22] And so our audience again, they're REALTORS.
[00:08:25] I know you're not a REALTOR.
[00:08:27] And so we're not going to tell our agents how to become better agents.
[00:08:31] But we will sort of talk a little bit about your experience as a buyer and seller.
[00:08:36] You've bought and sold three properties.
[00:08:38] So you're not totally, you know, even though this is your first book, you've had experience with REALTOR and you've interviewed REALTORS for the Washington, and magazine.
[00:08:47] And just in your journalism.
[00:08:49] X exploits, but let's get into writing.
[00:08:52] When did you know?
[00:08:53] I want to know when you knew you wanted to be a writer and maybe that's journalist, maybe that's novelist.
[00:08:59] When was it?
[00:08:59] What was the age?
[00:09:00] Yeah, well, that's a great, a great question.
[00:09:03] I so I will say I never ever thought I would write fiction.
[00:09:06] I never once said I'm going to be a novelist to me.
[00:09:09] That sounded about as plausible as saying I was going to be like a prince, a princess.
[00:09:14] Or like a Broadway actress or something.
[00:09:17] So I, but I've always loved to write.
[00:09:19] I don't really remember a time when I didn't like to write.
[00:09:21] I think I have credit a lot of it to being for the most part an only child.
[00:09:25] So I had a lot of like time to like make up stories.
[00:09:28] And you know, I spent a lot of time as a kid reading and writing.
[00:09:32] And you know, when it, when you got to those years in elementary school and people started asking what do you want to do when you grow up?
[00:09:38] I just said journalists because I thought that was what you did if you wanted to be a writer.
[00:09:42] So I decided from a very early age to be a journalist.
[00:09:46] You know, I took my major the second I watched, you know, watch in the door at college.
[00:09:50] 
[00:09:50] And I thought it would be a journalist forever.
[00:09:52] So the fact that I'm now sitting here talking to you about having written a novel is very surprising to me.
[00:09:59] And it's been this really fun, unexpected turn of events in the past in the past couple of years.
[00:10:06] Yeah.
[00:10:06] You always were writing about real things.
[00:10:09] So that is a totally different part of the brain and a totally different skill set.
[00:10:15] And what's amazing is that you've proven yourself in the journalism world, which not easy.
[00:10:21] Certainly journalists is a tough tough job because you're constantly piping out content and really having to speak to that particular audience.
[00:10:30] And now you've written for a totally different, I mean, I guess there's crossover but a totally different audience in a totally different style that is foreign to you.
[00:10:38] And not something you ever thought you'd do.
[00:10:40] So and by the way, you wrote this book in three months, which is like just incredible.
[00:10:47] I will be very clear.
[00:10:49] Yeah, I wrote a first draft in three months.
[00:10:51] It took longer to, you know, to make it into a into a good book.
[00:10:55] But yeah, that's right.
[00:10:57] How important.
[00:10:58] I do want to talk about the editing process because to me, the way I think about editors is and I've written for publications before.
[00:11:07] And having an editor's was critical because they were able to take my work, which was usually in the humor space and make it punchier tighter.
[00:11:18] And but I was just talking about this with my fiance.
[00:11:21] It's very, it was very difficult for me when I, because I was a blogger, just ready my own stuff for many, many years.
[00:11:27] And I had a decent following.
[00:11:29] And I didn't have anyone telling me this isn't funny enough or you need to make this, you know, different.
[00:11:34] But when I did find an editor, they did make it better in every case.
[00:11:38] But it was very difficult for me to accept that feedback.
[00:11:41] So as a journalist, you've worked with editors.
[00:11:43] So you, you, you were, you understand that process.
[00:11:46] Was it difficult though with a fictional tale, something you were really creating from your own brain?
[00:11:51] Was it difficult to work with an editor?
[00:11:53] Not at all.
[00:11:54] I, you know, so I will say I actually was an editor myself at the tail end of my, right before I sold the book.
[00:12:01] I was an editor of the Washington Post.
[00:12:03] So I know from firsthand experience how critical editing is and how, you know, a good editor can really elevate your writing.
[00:12:12] So no, you know, I was really, I have a great editor.
[00:12:14] My, my fiction editor is Ryan Dorety and Seladon. That's my publisher.
[00:12:18] And he's, he's awesome. And what I really love about him and what I always actually tried to do myself when I was editing journalism was to not be too prescriptive about the edit, but to just sort of tell the writer like here, you know, the four or five things that I think is important.
[00:12:32] I think needs to be punched up or that are missing or that I think we need to draw out make this emotion bigger or make this part, you know, quiet or whatever and then let the writer kind of figure out the specific kind of path to follow from there.
[00:12:45] So that's how Ryan edits.
[00:12:47] I actually think he and I are pretty similar editors.
[00:12:49] So it's, it's sort of it was a pretty painless experience actually. And I will say I had.
[00:12:55] I was very lucky to have my pick of a few different, and there were a few different publishers that wanted the book when I was selling it.
[00:13:02] And I had meetings with all of them and was very lucky to meet a lot of really impressive book editors.
[00:13:08] But I had a good vibe and a good feeling about Ryan from the jump. So I'm like, glad that it worked out the way that it did.
[00:13:14] The reason I'm talking about editing is because I see them as coaches and for sure, oftentimes, real, oftentimes, the most successful agents and agents even who were starting out.
[00:13:24] I think maybe I should get a coach. In fact, the most successful agents I know they all have coaches or almost all of them almost everyone I've interviewed on the show has had coaches, which, you know, we would put an editor in a similar category to a coach.
[00:13:36] So I think it's important to know that a successful editor like yourself, who might, might be more difficult to edit for because of your editing experience.
[00:13:46] It might be even harder for you to say, well, I wouldn't have edited it this way because you've had that role.
[00:13:53] But yet, you're obviously very coachable and you have to be as a writer, I suspect.
[00:13:58] Yeah, I don't think there's any weakness in that at all. I think actually, you know, when you can accept that oftentimes when you're in the weeds yourself on something, you can no longer see it.
[00:14:10] It's hard to see the full picture, you know, once you're really down in the weeds yourself.
[00:14:14] So having a coach on the sidelines able to point some of that stuff out to you is extremely helpful.
[00:14:20] Did the editor Ryan, did he make the book better?
[00:14:24] Yeah, definitely. He made the book better. And I will say, you know, in the publishing industry agents are also sort of sort of the first edits to like they like when I first got my book agents, they also read the manuscript and gave me some ideas to make it better before we started shopping at around the publishers.
[00:14:40] That's just sort of how the process works. So my agents also made it better. I mean, I think, you know, you can have too many hooks in the kitchen for sure. But if you find the right, you know, kind of the right smart people to bring into the fold, I think it's always for the better to have an outside perspective, especially on something as, yeah, something as personal as a book, like when you're really, you sometimes lose the big picture yourself.
[00:15:05] Yeah, I'm having this point hard because I want our audience to really realize that even successful editors and writers like Marissa have have coaches, right? And so REALTORS need this.
[00:15:17] I've interviewed a ton of former collegiate athletes, professional athletes who, you know, left that their sports career to then go on to become real estate agents or real estate professionals.
[00:15:28] They all got coaches because they're all used to being coached. And it's one of those things that I think, you know, as you said, it made your book better.
[00:15:36] Obviously, you're having tremendous success with it and that came from you, but somebody to help you see the things you don't see that you can't see from that third person perspective is so critical.
[00:15:47] So I'm glad that that was been your experience. Let's talk about the book. Okay.
[00:15:52] Great. No, tell us tell us about best offer wins. What is it about?
[00:15:56] So best offer wins is about the particular, the particular hell of trying to buy a home in a very, very competitive housing market.
[00:16:04] So it takes place in the post pandemic market. It's like the 2022-ish time period when the housing market all over the country was just going bonkers, you know, interest rates for nothing.
[00:16:15] The thanks for giving away mortgages and everybody was so sick of looking at their same four walls, right?
[00:16:21] So the book starts out with Margot, our main character. She and her husband are trapped in a small apartment. They have been outbid on 11 different homes.
[00:16:29] They've been, they've been trying to buy a house for two years now. Margot is at her breaking point and you'll also learn that she actually has a little bit of an obsessive tendency to begin away.
[00:16:39] So she's kind of like the very worst buyer to push too far. So she gets a tip about a house that is not yet on the market, but it's going to be listed in the month.
[00:16:49] And it's like the perfect house, perfect neighborhood, check, holoboxes. And she decides she's going to figure out a way to get that house before it is publicly listed.
[00:16:57] And the masses can descend upon it and outbid her once again. So she basically endeavors to warm her way into the lives of the homeowners and convince them to sell to her.
[00:17:10] And when that doesn't go quite as planned, her tactics sort of escalate from there and get more and more extreme and unhinged.
[00:17:19] And you are in her head for the entire book. It's the first person narrative. So you really have a front row seat to her, this like psychological unraveling as this goes on.
[00:17:28] And I really think that that is something that real estate agents will probably relate to because you guys work with clients all the time who are in the throes of the biggest investment they'll ever make.
[00:17:39] I mean, buying a house is so emotionally fraught. So I really do think this book is sort of take that that emotion to the very extreme.
[00:17:49] Yeah, it's really how far would someone go to the house, right?
[00:17:53] Yeah, we're talking about bidding more stress, open house anxiety, the emotional chaos that buyers feel when the house is like, oh, this is perfect. And I'm worried that 20 other people are also going to feel the same way.
[00:18:08] And I love this is a dark comedy thriller. It would that exactly. Yeah, yeah, I love that. And we gosh, I think it is such a great title. And it's funny that it really to my knowledge, I'm sure other writers have tried to tackle this topic, but probably not in the exact way that you did.
[00:18:27] And I think that is a really fun experience. Where did you, where did you sort of research the Margo character? Was it from experiences you've had yourself or conversations you've had with REALTORS since you've been in that industry.
[00:18:40] Tell us about about where that came from.
[00:18:42] Well, it's funny that you mentioned that you haven't read this before. I mean, that is why I decided to write the book actually. So I sort of, you know, I was a journalist. I felt a little bit creatively unfulfilled.
[00:18:52] You know, I'd reach for this point in my career where I sort of was looking for something else. And I thought, I'm just going to try writing fiction for fun because I have this idea.
[00:19:00] And I sort of cannot believe that nobody has done this already because the house hunt is such an emotionally like, you know, it's this kind of anxiety written thing.
[00:19:10] So the stakes feel so high when you're in it. So I thought it would make sort of the perfect context for a thriller.
[00:19:16] And yeah, I was shocked that no one else had done it yet. I based Margo on a lot of different things. I mean, so yeah, I covered real estate for a long time, including during the time period that the book takes place in. So during the pandemic.
[00:19:29] I wrote a cover story actually for Washington, me and magazine all about the COVID housing boom. And that I think I got a lot of inspiration. I mean, I didn't realize when I was reporting that story at the time that I would then repurpose that material for a book later.
[00:19:41] But I think that is actually when the seed was planted because I for that story, I interviewed dozens and dozens of house hunters and agents all going through this extremely difficult process of trying to buy a house when there are 50 other bids and, you know, half of them are all cash.
[00:19:58] And, you know, the open house lines are around the block. And so I did talk to house owners luckily nobody who was really to go quite to the extremes that Margo goes to in the book.
[00:20:06] But, you know, it was very normal at that time to, you know, write letters, write emotional letters with your own or to do things to try to get in the back door to like try to, you know, you would circle the neighborhood and see what that house is really is really cool.
[00:20:18] Maybe I'll just go knock on the door and see if there's any chance to sell it to me because you know, there was such a shortage of inventory.
[00:20:23] There still is a big inventory problem as your audience knows.
[00:20:27] So there were these things that were kind of like that were very normal to do, but that walked right up to the edge of like being too far.
[00:20:35] So when I decided to write the book, I thought, well, I'm just going to let my main character, because this is fiction now, she is going to take it over that line into the to I've gotten too far.
[00:20:44] Charatory.
[00:20:45] Yeah, I love that and so much of humor is taking a simple premise and then exaggerating it right and so that's that's essentially what the Margo character is is this idea of going in and doing some, you know, routine sort of looking up online of how what the maybe the motivations of these of the sellers might be and who they are so I can gain a slight advantage.
[00:21:08] And then you know, ramping that up and escalating that up into where it becomes absurd in her efforts and what what a funny thing.
[00:21:18] So I see it as this dark comedy and also a thriller when you started writing it, was it more of a comedy or more of a thriller at first?
[00:21:26] Were you sure or did you want to marry those two at the same time?
[00:21:30] So I, the first idea that I had was the twist that comes late in the book. So I can't tell you what that is about that would ruin the book, but the twist is very much thriller.
[00:21:42] Right. So that was so I guess I if we're talking about, you know, where what was the first where did I actually start from? I started from the twist. So I guess that was that that would be like starting from the point of the thriller.
[00:21:54] But I also knew I wanted more I wanted the main character to not be like you're traditionally like a bull main character. Like I knew she was going to be like, you know, she was going to be like a Walter White like a behaving badly main character who hopefully you would still decide that you want to tag along with for the whole ride anyway and maybe even start to root for even as she does like really despicable things.
[00:22:16] So I thought, you know, a way to make her even if you're appalled by what she's doing. I still wanted you to maybe like her. So to me humor was the way into that. So she does have a pretty darkly funny in her monologues that you get to be privy to as as the reader.
[00:22:36] You know, in particular because what we're talking about is buying she's she her budget is $1.3 million. She's buying a nice, you know, pretty nice, you know, high end home.
[00:22:46] She comes herself from very humble beginnings and is very self made. So she's now a PR she's a publicist in the DC area her husband's a government lawyer.
[00:22:56] So she has made this life for herself unlike a lot of the people that she sees around her who, you know, from her point of view had had everything candid to them like there, you know, trust fund, you know, kids who have all cash, you know, from their parents to put down on a house.
[00:23:10] They all went to the right Ivy League schools, but she did not. So you are privy to the way she is kind of for seeming to people around her.
[00:23:16] And so there is a lot of commentary on the sort of class that comes along with the book.
[00:23:22] And she just feels like she's had to work, you know, 10 times as hard as all these people. So she's owed this house.
[00:23:27] And she's going to have to like take matters into her own hands to get it.
[00:23:32] Yeah, I love that. You know, it's funny. I just started my fiance and I started. We said, let's read a book together that just do something together.
[00:23:43] And so we run. Yeah, yeah, we she was talking about joining a book club. And then she's like, I don't know if I have time for that. Like we could just do a book club ourselves.
[00:23:50] Yeah, so my husband and my husband and I sometimes do that. And it's fun because then you have to move to talk about.
[00:23:55] Well, we just started reading. What what are we reading? Agatha Christie's and then there was none, which we used to be telling the Indians, right, which I see a lot of Agatha Christie.
[00:24:05] I don't know if she was a major inspiration for you, but she is darkly funny, darkly funny. I mean, one of just the funniest writers.
[00:24:12] And obviously she's more mystery than thriller, but that thriller too, I guess. And so I see a little bit of that. I don't know if she was one of one of your heroes.
[00:24:21] But it certainly seems as you're talking, you know, just the way that she writes. So I guess that's I guess that's a nice compliment.
[00:24:29] Well, that is a huge compliment. I will say even, you know, I think Agatha Christie's work is just so sort of in the culture now that even if you don't realize she was an influence, she probably was.
[00:24:40] I mean, I think there are you can see threads of Agatha Christie in a lot of really successful modern commercial thrillers. So yeah, she probably did work her way in there somewhere.
[00:24:50] Who were who were your fiction heroes growing up?
[00:24:54] So, oh gosh, well, you know, as I already said, like I didn't ever think I was going to be an author. So I a lot of a lot of my writing heroes were more were actually more nonfiction.
[00:25:02] That's where I was focused. Like I'm a huge David David Grand fan. I don't know if you know him. He's a New Yorker writer, but he's written a couple of few books that are like historical nonfiction, but they're so good that they read like novels.
[00:25:15] But I will say when I was thinking about creating a female protagonist who does some bad things, I definitely did think a lot about gone girl.
[00:25:25] And the character of Amy Dunn, I would say I don't think Margot is Margot and Amy Dunn are very different, but they are the same and that they are not afraid to really like go the extra mile for what they want.
[00:25:42] But what do you think the book says about status status neighborhoods? Let's talk about that because that's a big theme in the book. Like who gets in who gets priced out, you know, who gets judged.
[00:25:53] There's a lot of that in here. So tell us talk about status.
[00:25:57] Yeah, for sure. So Margot, as I already mentioned, she comes from the sort of working class background.
[00:26:02] She definitely has like a bit of a chip on her shoulder because of that and like I think a little bit of an inferiority complex.
[00:26:08] And so I think she sees this sort of Instagram perfect life as like the thing that will make her valuable.
[00:26:15] So she wants the perfect house and the perfect, you know, the perfect marriage. She's also been, she's trying to have a baby and her and her husband are dealing with some infertility issues, which further add to her, you know, already really high stress level.
[00:26:29] But she wants the perfect baby. She wants all she wants what she perceives or maybe more, maybe more specifically what she thinks the outside world perceives as the perfect life.
[00:26:39] And that will then mean that she herself has arrived. So she wants to achieve a certain level of status in the book.
[00:26:46] Because that's the messaging that's being directed at her, you know, from Pinterest and from Instagram. And I do think there is a there's been a heightening of that because of social media for sure.
[00:26:59] I mean, I don't know that I actually would be really curious to know what most real estate agents would say about that because I think, you know, there probably was a time when no one was watching HDTV.
[00:27:11] And no one was, you know, scrolling all of the beautiful design account on Instagram. And so maybe they didn't know if they wanted to ask for, you know, unlackered brass fixtures in every bad moment, you know, all of these things that now are these kind of status symbols.
[00:27:25] Well, I think to, you know, speaking of social media, I think it has certainly made real estate more popular in sort of the ethos of what we look at and because there's an aesthetic to it that I think, you know, social media and Instagram in particular, you know, just is very sort of obviously attracted to.
[00:27:46] And I think also too, there's the idea of perfection is really kind of like what's the aesthetic ideal is what we see a lot on, of course, well now with AI making everything perfect, including ourselves, our homes, our meals.
[00:28:03] And it really is, it's really an interesting sort of thing that we never had before. So there's always, you know, there's Photoshop has been around for maybe 30 years, but it wasn't quite, you know, that sort of that technology wasn't pushed in our face every 10 seconds as we scroll.
[00:28:23] And now we're seeing it everywhere. And so there's this idea that we have to look a certain way that we have to have a home that looks a certain way or we have to at least make our home look a certain way when we're presenting it to others online, right, there's this idea that our lives have to look perfect and I think, you know, we have to win this sort of status race.
[00:28:44] And can you talk a little bit about that like how has, I mean, what do you think, where do you think we're headed with this idea of everything being so, so perfect, curious, just what your thoughts are there.
[00:29:00] I don't know if I can predict the future, but I will say that exactly what you're describing is part of the immense pressure that Margot feels in the book and that then that she's very much cracking it. I mean, she's experiencing a real mental break in this book, whether she herself realizes it or not, but definitely all of this pressure that she's, you know, this imagery that you were talking about that gets fed to us. I mean, the fact that it just looks, you know, I think people start to think it's very normal to have a perfect looking hat. I mean, that's like what you need.
[00:29:28] What's that's like the standard that you have to meet because everybody on Instagram looks like their life is perfect and no, and of course, what you don't see on Instagram are all of the outtakes, you know, that are not perfect.
[00:29:39] So yeah, so Margot is very much cracking under that pressure. You know, where do I think we're going from here? I mean, God, unfortunately, you mentioned AI, AI is only becoming more and more pervasive. So I don't think this problem is going to go away.
[00:29:54] But like, you know, like I told you a minute ago that I'm 40 and what, you know, what I really started to kind of think about is how no one really knows what a 40 year old looks like anymore.
[00:30:05] Right.
[00:30:06] You know, because there's so much there's that we mean if you're not actually getting, you know, injected or filled or whatever in real life, like you can have the Instagram filter that makes you look like you have been.
[00:30:14] So I'm like, what am I supposed to like what what what is it actually mean to look your age anymore. So it's sort of the same pressure.
[00:30:22] But but with that those same pressures and those same like kind of Instagram perfect filters are also applied to the housing.
[00:30:29] Yeah, I do see I do see another novel for you where a 40 year old woman rejects all of the perfectionist sort of technology.
[00:30:38] And says I'm going to exist in this world as I am and sort of the way that people react to her treat her. I think I think that would would make for a well certainly funny premise, but really something that would speak to a lot of people at that stage of life, especially women.
[00:30:57] And we know what Instagram does to young girls, but the time of your teen, it's really bad. But but certainly for women who are at that stage of life and as adults, I think gosh, it's got to be it's got to not be fun to think like, oh, I don't I don't look the I don't look how I feel that I'm supposed to look, which is such a thing that shouldn't matter.
[00:31:20] Yeah, and the bar and the bar keeps moving, which is so it's just like an unwinnable. It feels like an unwinnable battle.
[00:31:27] Women have it tough and I think women have it. I mean, we know why we know that women have it tough, but women have to be so much more, I think.
[00:31:35] And I think social media is really made this more challenging for women in particular, because you you are seeing these women living these at least perceived amazingly idealized lives, right?
[00:31:48] Where they're doing especially real a lot of really successful real estate, REALTOR's who are women really try to showcase this life of look at how I'm a perfect mother. I'm a perfect REALTOR.
[00:32:01] I go to the gym every morning. I have this perfect latte or or you know my food is per its incredibly must be exhausting to showcase that kind of lifestyle. They do it for maybe branding reasons.
[00:32:13] But there is this pressure, I think, for all of us, but certainly women adult women to be seen as I can do everything.
[00:32:22] Yeah.
[00:32:23] And I think that is that's I think that's problematic, right?
[00:32:27] Yeah. And certainly again, I don't know if this is intentionally or not, but you're definitely hitting on a big theme in the book, which is that you know there's a lot of female rage in this book.
[00:32:35] Yeah.
[00:32:36] Margo has this like really like kind of constantly simmering rage within her that propels her to do a lot of these horrible things.
[00:32:46] But I think that rage for for Margo is in large part of products of all of this pressure that she feels.
[00:32:52] And so she's just decided that she's going to lean really hard into that rage now and let it carry her.
[00:32:58] Now as you're writing about this character and you're so used to writing about real people in the journalism world.
[00:33:05] Did there was there ever any point where as Margo's becoming more and more unhinged wanting this property that you started to see parts of yourself in Margo, or was there ever a thought of like, oh, I, this is coming from my brain.
[00:33:18] I sort of you know, you write what you know, right? So I don't know how much of that you could identify.
[00:33:23] Well, I will say that Margo and I do not share the same views on a lot of things, but for sure I relate to her rage and I felt it was actually very cathartic to get to write that part of the character because you know, I think if you're like a sentient woman in today's world, you do feel some anger.
[00:33:45] And so to get to, but you can't have it, you know, in life society, we don't get to act on it.
[00:33:49] It's the way that Margo does in the book, so to allow a fictional character to really go full tilt right into that anger was really, really fun and.
[00:33:58] And yeah, yeah, so I do that there absolutely. There is a lot of me and Margo for sure.
[00:34:03] I think that's important for us to realize too, just in society is that women, another thing that we really don't encourage them to do is to be angry.
[00:34:11] We don't like, we don't like men are allowed to be angry, right? We're allowed to be angry, but women are often not.
[00:34:17] And so this idea of, you know, of course women are, you know, they're human beings. They have anger. It's normal. It's healthy actually.
[00:34:24] And the idea of speaking to women's anger, I think is really important. And so I'm glad that, you know, you're tackling it in a funny way and over the top way at times.
[00:34:34] But I think it's really important for us to recognize that, you know, it is tough for women to be able to express their anger. It's certainly in public or, or, you know, it's just not perceived as, you know, the ideal for which is completely insane.
[00:34:48] Obviously, men aren't supposed to cry and women aren't supposed to get angry, right?
[00:34:52] That's true.
[00:34:53] Yes, thankfully that's changing. I believe, but, but I'm glad that you're speaking to this because it is something that that a lot of women can relate to, especially like as REALTORS, they have to stay calm under pressure.
[00:35:04] They're not supposed to, I have a woman who is one of the most successful agents in Chicago. She comes on my show often and she's beloved. I mean, she's a lovely human being.
[00:35:16] She will say, you cannot believe how people talk to me, even though she's been in this business 20 plus years and she is as sweet as, I mean, she's tough.
[00:35:25] She should be, but she's absolutely fair and honest and she will say, in particular, the way men will speak to her. She, she doesn't complain about it. She's just like, just so you know, and I'm like, yeah, it's amazing to me that that happens. And it's like, oh yeah, as men, we forget that a lot of times that, you know, women really have, it's tough.
[00:35:44] It's tough to be a woman in business. It's tough to be a woman who's who's assertive. I think that is just just difficult in general. And it's something that as men, we need to be more compassionate towards.
[00:35:55] Oh, yes. Well, that's good on you for saying that. I, you know, I do think Margo was cathartic for me to write. And I do think it's because I mean, hopefully cathartic for a lot of women to read that character too.
[00:36:06] Because, yeah, Margo is a very successful professional woman, but also trying to be a mom, also trying to, you know, keep the marriage intact.
[00:36:16] And yeah, she is trying to have it all, you know, which is a thing. It's so funny, you know, no one really ever says to men, you should try to have it all. But women get fed this message pretty regularly that we have to try to have it all, which is an insane thing to try to have.
[00:36:29] No one can actually, you know, really have it all and maintain any kind of a balance. So, so yes, Margo's cracking up that pressure, you know, I certainly have felt that pressure myself in my own life. I know my friends have, you know, I think any working professional woman has felt this has felt this way.
[00:36:44] Oh, yeah. Usmen, we get other bad messages. We don't get that one. We get other ones that are, that are, you know, equally awful, but, but not not in the same way. And I think I think it's important for, you know, real estate agents, 67% of them are women.
[00:36:59] So it's important for us to really even have this conversation in a sort of lighthearted way. But, but also it's it's important to know that especially women REALTORS who are supposed to be just so perfect.
[00:37:12] And again, it's it's it's a it's unfortunately something that that, you know, needs to be sort of considered. And of course, you know, it's funny. You're talking about social media. Whenever I see somebody who has the courage to post something imperfect and I don't mean they.
[00:37:28] You know, somebody catches them slipping or falling or something silly, but more like they're having a really bad day and they post about, you know, something that is imperfect. Maybe they're, you know, something happened or that they're wish to share, but it's so courageous.
[00:37:43] And it's interesting that sometimes people will look down on those people who post that stuff saying, oh, look, now they're aiming for sympathy. And it's like, well, you can't have it both ways, right? We can't have this idea that you only post the beauty and not sort of the the imperfections of life and then shame the person for for sharing what's actually more human and real.
[00:38:05] And so I love that your book, you know, really goes into that more human in real side. And again, obviously in an exaggerated state, but but something that that we all have those thoughts and we all have those imperfections and everybody's got problems that everybody's on the verge of, you know, committing a crime in their mind and just trying to realize, okay, I'm not going to go out and do that, but I did think that.
[00:38:28] And that's, and that's perfectly okay. Let's talk about, you know, sort of what do you think this book gets right about buyer emotions?
[00:38:38] Well, I do think and I feel like I'm really preaching the choir here given who your audience is, but I do think that when you're buying a house, it feels like the most important thing in the whole universe.
[00:38:48] I mean, I really do think that, you know, especially if you're if you're buying in a in a seller's market where it's very competitive, you know, I think you get blinders on and you just nothing else matters.
[00:38:58] I mean, and with with with good reason, because for most people, it is the most money they're ever going to spend on anything.
[00:39:05] But I also think it's not only financial stake, it's emotional stake. So I think, you know, everybody sort of brings their own sort of personal baggage to what it means to be a homeowner and what it mean, what a dream home means.
[00:39:19] So that is a big theme in the book also. Margo comes from a family that had a pretty challenged relationship with homeownership.
[00:39:29] And that's a big driver for her. And she sort of wants to go out now and create for herself the dream life that she feels, you know, her parents were we're not able to provide for her.
[00:39:39] She feels like she was sort of deprived of that growing up, whereas her husband Ian comes from this very sort of, you know, kind of nice, you know, salt to the earth midwestern family where he grew up, you know, when a nice, you know, in a loving, you know, stable home.
[00:39:54] So what I wanted to explore through their dynamic was this idea of all of the emotional kind of personal baggage that people bring to the house hunt because it's very different for these two people in this marriage.
[00:40:07] I mean, Margo is so dead set on getting the dream house. She really feels like it's the thing that's missing in her life. And she's got it and she really is convinced that if she doesn't go out and grab it for herself, and you know, it's not just going to happen for her.
[00:40:20] She's going to have to work really hard for it, whereas Ian, you know, is sort of just like it's all going to work out kind of guy like he's like, you know, if it's meant to be, it'll have this one, you know, if this house is meant to be ours, we'll get it like that's his attitude.
[00:40:31] And it's driving Margo crazy, you know, so that she's sort of having to carry the bulk of the stress of the house hunt. But what it comes down to is that they come from these very different backgrounds where, you know, Ian just doesn't feel the same urgency and the same hunger for this that Margo does.
[00:40:48] And I think that I mean, I do think, you know, based on having bought, you know, home myself and also having been a reporter talking to real life homeowners, I do think that I, I the book does get that part right about about the house hunt.
[00:41:01] Yeah, often one party or one person in the by side wants it a little bit more or it's more important that they win that then maybe the other person.
[00:41:10] And that becomes challenging for the relationship. It's challenging for the for the REALTOR. And it's it's it's tough because that person who is so invested really wants the their partner if they're, you know, if they have a partner to feel the same way.
[00:41:27] And it can be very frustrating to have the other person go like, I will find something else. It's fine.
[00:41:32] Yeah, or maybe even if it's not like relationship drama, even if it's just, you know, when I was a kid, you know, the most, the most beautiful house on my block with a Cape Cod. And that is what is it. That's a dream house to me. And that's what I want. That's the only kind of house I want, you know, like even if it's just stuff like that. I do think we all bring our own emotional personal histories to homes to, you know, being a homeowner is so connected with the American dream for better for worse.
[00:42:01] And so I think we we just put so much weight onto it onto the house.
[00:42:07] Yeah, I do. I wanted to get I really just have one last question for you because this is a hot topic in real estate. Some argue for REALTORS in particular not not for the public, but some argue this could be a fair housing violation. Some states say don't do it.
[00:42:22] Now as a consumer, this, this they wouldn't know this, but this idea of writing a love letter to the sellers. So what's your, what's your view on the love letter? Is it romantic? Is it manipulative? Is it both? You know, what do you think about love letters?
[00:42:36] So I will say I have never written one myself, but I did when we sold our last house, we received some love, a couple of letters. And my agent told me not to read them because he was like, you should not let this.
[00:42:53] Sure.
[00:42:53] Let's we should just let everyone be on an equal playing field and we're just going to look at the bottom line kind of what the closing terms are.
[00:43:00] And I'm really glad that he told me that because after we did, you know, after we picked, you know, the buyer and we sold the house, I did go back and look at a couple of those.
[00:43:12] And I think I don't know that it would have changed the outcome, but I would have just felt, you know, guilty or for not having sold to this lovely couple with an adorable new puppy. And you know what I mean?
[00:43:23] Like I, so I don't, I, from the seller's perspective, I just, I don't see a world in which I would ever read them.
[00:43:31] From the buyer's side, I mean, I don't know. I think if you, if you, if you feel like that's survived, you want, like if that's what you want to do, I mean, I, who am I to tell you what, what not to do.
[00:43:45] But yeah, I mean, certainly, I think if you're saying, I do see how it could become a fair housing violation, depending on the kind of information you're including in the letter, for sure.
[00:43:54] Well, yeah, yeah, we're not saying does it work or not? It works. It's just should, should it be done? Should it be allowed?
[00:44:00] Well, yeah, right, right. Is, is the idea that, and I think your agent gave you great advice when you were, you know, when you were selling, just, you know, don't pay attention to this because it will, of course, we're humanable influence us.
[00:44:11] Yeah.
[00:44:11] And it will influence us in a way that's probably unfair to the other people looking at again, whether that's legal or not is, is a different question.
[00:44:20] But it is, it is an interesting tactic because we know it's effective. And yet, the sort of the REALTOR boards are trying real estate boards trying to figure out is, is, is there an ethical issue here that violates, you know, some of the standards that, that agents are attempting to maintain.
[00:44:37] But it is funny. I'm glad you included it because especially during the pandemic, that's when, you know, we saw a lot of that.
[00:44:44] And, and it was interest rates were so low that buyers were just out and everybody was competing. And as you said, you, you, you live through those times as well.
[00:44:54] So I am really wanting everybody to go pick up this book, you know, as agents, you'll love it. You'll, you'll get it.
[00:45:02] And this is absolutely in your wheelhouse of experience. And if nothing else, it'll just be a cathartic moment for you because everybody's had a crazy client.
[00:45:11] And everybody's had a listing where there was a crazy buyer or, you know, that, and so this is a great opportunity for you to connect with a, another, you know, someone who has validated this experience,
[00:45:23] in a fictional way and had a lot of fun with it. And you'll smile and laugh along the way as you go through this, this sort of, you know, emotional roller coaster of, of, of want versus, you know, versus outcome, I guess.
[00:45:39] And, and what people are willing to do to, to get there and, and to achieve the status that we all, you know, at times think like, oh, that's, that's where the happiness is.
[00:45:48] If I just get the thing, then I will be happy. And it's so interesting to when, when you see sort of the data on, unhappiness, I think that's, you know, talk about dream homes.
[00:45:58] And the data on happiness is really interesting where it's like once you, with salary, once you get above your basic needs and you can, you know, you're not worried about money every month.
[00:46:07] Happiness doesn't really go up as much as income goes up. It really stays fairly steady for you make, you know, $100,000 or a million dollars.
[00:46:17] It's not much different below that. Yes, there, there's a lot of unhappiness, but it's interesting. So it's a good reminder for all of us to think about, you know, what really brings us happiness.
[00:46:27] You know, is it that thing that I don't have yet? Is it that achievement? Is it that, that item that I want to buy? And, and, you know, what are we going? What are we really looking for?
[00:46:35] And for most of us is we're looking for connection or looking for, you know, relationships and things like that. So I think this book touches on all of that. So I'm really hoping that our audience goes out and picks this up. It's a bestseller.
[00:46:48] It's, you know, it's maybe I'm going to be on television someday and Marissa has has really just become part of this conversation.
[00:46:58] And so we're so happy to have you. The book is best offer wins, find it anywhere books are sold. Certainly pick it up on Amazon. If you'd like, oh, and there's an audiobook version as well.
[00:47:09] Do you recommend if people were to choose one or the other? What do you think? Do you like the audiobook version?
[00:47:18] I mean, I think I think you can't go wrong here. Sorry, here's the cover. I've got to do my little promo.
[00:47:23] Please.
[00:47:24] I mean, I love a hardcover book. I'm personally like I like to read the real book, but if you're an audiobook person, I think the audio book is super fun. And that was actually a really fun thing that I got to be a part of was the auditions for the person that for the voice actress.
[00:47:38] And she a court is the actor who reads the audiobook and she just totally knocked out of the park. You can not go wrong.
[00:47:44] We have a lot of audiobook listeners who are REALTORS because they listen as they're driving from.
[00:47:49] Oh, for sure. Yeah. Yeah.
[00:47:50] Definitely consider if that's works better for you, check that out on Audible. And again, Marissa is our guest. She is what's next? You have another novel in you?
[00:48:02] Yes. Well, gosh, I sure hope so because this is my job now. I do have another novel in the works. It's not real estate specific like the first one, but it is similar in tone.
[00:48:14] Another dark comedy thriller takes place at least partially in the DC area. So yes, the station for that one.
[00:48:22] I love it. Well, follow Marissa on her Instagram, which is Marissa, because she know which is K. A. S. H. I. and oh, and we'll have a link to her Instagram as well as the book on our show notes.
[00:48:34] Marissa, thank you so much for your time today. I know this was a departure for you as far as interviews go, but I appreciate you coming on our show.
[00:48:41] And we really hope our audience supports you and thank you for writing about our industry and really just having fun with it and making it.
[00:48:49] You know, there's a lot of just negativity right now aimed at REALTORS and within our world. And you know, something like this is really fun for us.
[00:48:57] And we appreciate it. And really again, cathartic as well at times. So thank you. Thank you for doing that. And we will we will become, you know, your big fans write her reviews on Amazon. That helps as well.
[00:49:09] So get the book, let the, let Amazon know what you think about the book so that she can get in front of more and more people. And any last words for our audience.
[00:49:21] Just thank you. Thank you very so much. And it was a pleasure to get to have this chat with you.
[00:49:26] Awesome. On behalf of our audience, thanks, Marissa and on behalf of Marissa and myself, thank you to the audience for sticking around to the end. We appreciate you.
[00:49:33] As always, the best way that you can help us continue to grow is by telling a friend that give another agent in your office that would benefit from hearing this great conversation with Marissa and send them a link.

Now, as a real estate recruiter, I can tell you the answer is always yes. But most agents aren't looking to move right now. So how do you know who to contact? Well, what if I were to tell you there's a recruiting and retention tool powered by artificial intelligence that shows you exactly which agents in your local market are looking to leave their brokerage right now and which agents at your own firm are also looking to leave you? Now, I've been recruiting REALTORS for 15 years and I've hired over 2,000 agents. I can tell you with no exaggeration, this is the tool I've been waiting for. Corded's AI looks for trends across dozens of variables for each agent in your market and shows you which agents they believe are likely to move.

I am your guide and host through the show. Today is a very special episode for us here at Keeping It Real. We have best selling author, Marissa Caschino, and she is a fiction writer and wrote an amazing book that everybody needs to read called Best Offer Wins. And it is funny, it is dark, it is thrilling. If you liked Gone Girl, you're going to love this. It's a very big deal. It's on all sorts of awards. It's won a bunch of awards and it's on all sorts of book lists. If we're going to be talking with Marissa about how this book came to be, it's her very first novel, and she is crushing it. And it's even currently being optioned for a television deal as well. So this is awesome. It's our first time interviewing a fiction writer talking about the real estate business. You will love this book. I'm reading it right now and it's so great. I love it.

And this is a real departure for us. The first kind of episode we've done like this in close to, well, over 700 episodes now. But she is the author. In fact, I will tell you how I became aware of you. We received, and you don't know this. I don't think. And I'm going to introduce you in just a moment. But we received a anonymous, we sent book in the mail. That was to our office here. And we occasionally because of my podcast, I get sent books. And there's usually information about it. Or it's for a guest I'm going to be having on the show. And in this case, there wasn't that. Or maybe there was in that part got thrown away before I got handed to me. But I got handed this novel. And I thought, oh, this is cool. And then we realized, oh, this is probably a marketing thing. They're sending it to real estate companies or real estate brokerages. And I saw this and I said, I have to have Marissa the author on our show. So I want to introduce you to Marissa. This is again, a complete change for us. We're normally interviewing top agents. But now we're interviewing. I top best selling author. Marissa, she is the author of Best Offer Wins. Which by the way, isn't just a book that we has a great title that we think our audience would love. But she is also a legitimately credited author. She is a good morning America book club pick. So GMA says this is the book to read. She's also, by the way, not just a best selling author. She's in development right now with Hulu for a TV series about this exact topic. And other things too, she's a big deal. This is, she's previously a journalist. Most recently at Washington Post also a very big deal. She spent the bulk of her career at Washingtonian magazine, which is a citywide magazine writing long form features overseeing the real estate at home design coverage. She's worked with a lot of agents. She grew up near Seattle graduating from University of Washington with degree in journalism and polypsi. She now lives in DC area where there are husband two dogs, two cats. I also have two cats. Best author wins, which was published in 2025. Get this her very first novel.

Marissa, welcome to the show. Wow. Well, thank you. That is quite a welcome. I don't think anyone has given me an introduction like that other than my own mother, probably. But thank you so much. It's wonderful to be here. Everybody's a best selling author except they're not really. And you actually are. So I am very excited. And I wanted to give you the proper respect that this novel deserves. And also congratulations on being your debut novel and having such a. Really lightning in a bottle sort of situation. So, you know, good luck. And we're really excited to see your trajectory and follow your your career. And so our audience again, they're REALTORS. I know you're not a REALTOR. And so we're not going to tell our agents how to become better agents. But we will sort of talk a little bit about your experience as a buyer and seller. You've bought and sold three properties. So you're not totally, you know, even though this is your first book, you've had experience with REALTOR and you've interviewed REALTORS for the Washington, and magazine. And just in your journalism. X exploits, but let's get into writing. When did you know? I want to know when you knew you wanted to be a writer and maybe that's journalist, maybe that's novelist. When was it? What was the age? Yeah, well, that's a great, a great question. I so I will say I never ever thought I would write fiction. I never once said I'm going to be a novelist to me. That sounded about as plausible as saying I was going to be like a prince, a princess. Or like a Broadway actress or something. So I, but I've always loved to write. I don't really remember a time when I didn't like to write. I think I have credit a lot of it to being for the most part an only child. So I had a lot of like time to like make up stories. And you know, I spent a lot of time as a kid reading and writing. And you know, when it, when you got to those years in elementary school and people started asking what do you want to do when you grow up? I just said journalists because I thought that was what you did if you wanted to be a writer. So I decided from a very early age to be a journalist. You know, I took my major the second I watched, you know, watch in the door at college. And I thought it would be a journalist forever. So the fact that I'm now sitting here talking to you about having written a novel is very surprising to me. And it's been this really fun, unexpected turn of events in the past in the past couple of years. Yeah. You always were writing about real things. So that is a totally different part of the brain and a totally different skill set. And what's amazing is that you've proven yourself in the journalism world, which not easy. Certainly journalists is a tough tough job because you're constantly piping out content and really having to speak to that particular audience. And now you've written for a totally different, I mean, I guess there's crossover but a totally different audience in a totally different style that is foreign to you. And not something you ever thought you'd do. So and by the way, you wrote this book in three months, which is like just incredible. I will be very clear. Yeah, I wrote a first draft in three months. It took longer to, you know, to make it into a into a good book. But yeah, that's right. How important. I do want to talk about the editing process because to me, the way I think about editors is and I've written for publications before. And having an editor's was critical because they were able to take my work, which was usually in the humor space and make it punchier tighter. And but I was just talking about this with my fiance. It's very, it was very difficult for me when I, because I was a blogger, just ready my own stuff for many, many years. And I had a decent following. And I didn't have anyone telling me this isn't funny enough or you need to make this, you know, different. But when I did find an editor, they did make it better in every case. But it was very difficult for me to accept that feedback. So as a journalist, you've worked with editors. So you, you, you were, you understand that process. Was it difficult though with a fictional tale, something you were really creating from your own brain? Was it difficult to work with an editor? Not at all. I, you know, so I will say I actually was an editor myself at the tail end of my, right before I sold the book. I was an editor of the Washington Post. So I know from firsthand experience how critical editing is and how, you know, a good editor can really elevate your writing. So no, you know, I was really, I have a great editor. My, my fiction editor is Ryan Dorety and Seladon. That's my publisher. And he's, he's awesome. And what I really love about him and what I always actually tried to do myself when I was editing journalism was to not be too prescriptive about the edit, but to just sort of tell the writer like here, you know, the four or five things that I think is important. I think needs to be punched up or that are missing or that I think we need to draw out make this emotion bigger or make this part, you know, quiet or whatever and then let the writer kind of figure out the specific kind of path to follow from there. So that's how Ryan edits. I actually think he and I are pretty similar editors. So it's, it's sort of it was a pretty painless experience actually. And I will say I had. I was very lucky to have my pick of a few different, and there were a few different publishers that wanted the book when I was selling it. And I had meetings with all of them and was very lucky to meet a lot of really impressive book editors. But I had a good vibe and a good feeling about Ryan from the jump. So I'm like, glad that it worked out the way that it did. The reason I'm talking about editing is because I see them as coaches and for sure, oftentimes, real, oftentimes, the most successful agents and agents even who were starting out. I think maybe I should get a coach. In fact, the most successful agents I know they all have coaches or almost all of them almost everyone I've interviewed on the show has had coaches, which, you know, we would put an editor in a similar category to a coach. So I think it's important to know that a successful editor like yourself, who might, might be more difficult to edit for because of your editing experience. It might be even harder for you to say, well, I wouldn't have edited it this way because you've had that role. But yet, you're obviously very coachable and you have to be as a writer, I suspect. Yeah, I don't think there's any weakness in that at all. I think actually, you know, when you can accept that oftentimes when you're in the weeds yourself on something, you can no longer see it. It's hard to see the full picture, you know, once you're really down in the weeds yourself. So having a coach on the sidelines able to point some of that stuff out to you is extremely helpful. Did the editor Ryan, did he make the book better? Yeah, definitely. He made the book better. And I will say, you know, in the publishing industry agents are also sort of sort of the first edits to like they like when I first got my book agents, they also read the manuscript and gave me some ideas to make it better before we started shopping at around the publishers. That's just sort of how the process works. So my agents also made it better. I mean, I think, you know, you can have too many hooks in the kitchen for sure. But if you find the right, you know, kind of the right smart people to bring into the fold, I think it's always for the better to have an outside perspective, especially on something as, yeah, something as personal as a book, like when you're really, you sometimes lose the big picture yourself. Yeah, I'm having this point hard because I want our audience to really realize that even successful editors and writers like Marissa have have coaches, right? And so REALTORS need this. I've interviewed a ton of former collegiate athletes, professional athletes who, you know, left that their sports career to then go on to become real estate agents or real estate professionals. They all got coaches because they're all used to being coached. And it's one of those things that I think, you know, as you said, it made your book better. Obviously, you're having tremendous success with it and that came from you, but somebody to help you see the things you don't see that you can't see from that third person perspective is so critical. So I'm glad that that was been your experience. Let's talk about the book. Okay. Great. No, tell us tell us about best offer wins. What is it about? So best offer wins is about the particular, the particular hell of trying to buy a home in a very, very competitive housing market. So it takes place in the post pandemic market. It's like the 2022-ish time period when the housing market all over the country was just going bonkers, you know, interest rates for nothing. The thanks for giving away mortgages and everybody was so sick of looking at their same four walls, right? So the book starts out with Margot, our main character. She and her husband are trapped in a small apartment. They have been outbid on 11 different homes. They've been, they've been trying to buy a house for two years now. Margot is at her breaking point and you'll also learn that she actually has a little bit of an obsessive tendency to begin away. So she's kind of like the very worst buyer to push too far. So she gets a tip about a house that is not yet on the market, but it's going to be listed in the month. And it's like the perfect house, perfect neighborhood, check, holoboxes. And she decides she's going to figure out a way to get that house before it is publicly listed. And the masses can descend upon it and outbid her once again. So she basically endeavors to warm her way into the lives of the homeowners and convince them to sell to her. And when that doesn't go quite as planned, her tactics sort of escalate from there and get more and more extreme and unhinged. And you are in her head for the entire book. It's the first person narrative. So you really have a front row seat to her, this like psychological unraveling as this goes on. And I really think that that is something that real estate agents will probably relate to because you guys work with clients all the time who are in the throes of the biggest investment they'll ever make. I mean, buying a house is so emotionally fraught. So I really do think this book is sort of take that that emotion to the very extreme. Yeah, it's really how far would someone go to the house, right? Yeah, we're talking about bidding more stress, open house anxiety, the emotional chaos that buyers feel when the house is like, oh, this is perfect. And I'm worried that 20 other people are also going to feel the same way. And I love this is a dark comedy thriller. It would that exactly. Yeah, yeah, I love that. And we gosh, I think it is such a great title. And it's funny that it really to my knowledge, I'm sure other writers have tried to tackle this topic, but probably not in the exact way that you did. And I think that is a really fun experience. Where did you, where did you sort of research the Margo character? Was it from experiences you've had yourself or conversations you've had with REALTORS since you've been in that industry. Tell us about about where that came from. Well, it's funny that you mentioned that you haven't read this before. I mean, that is why I decided to write the book actually. So I sort of, you know, I was a journalist. I felt a little bit creatively unfulfilled. You know, I'd reach for this point in my career where I sort of was looking for something else. And I thought, I'm just going to try writing fiction for fun because I have this idea. And I sort of cannot believe that nobody has done this already because the house hunt is such an emotionally like, you know, it's this kind of anxiety written thing. So the stakes feel so high when you're in it. So I thought it would make sort of the perfect context for a thriller. And yeah, I was shocked that no one else had done it yet. I based Margo on a lot of different things. I mean, so yeah, I covered real estate for a long time, including during the time period that the book takes place in. So during the pandemic. I wrote a cover story actually for Washington, me and magazine all about the COVID housing boom. And that I think I got a lot of inspiration. I mean, I didn't realize when I was reporting that story at the time that I would then repurpose that material for a book later. But I think that is actually when the seed was planted because I for that story, I interviewed dozens and dozens of house hunters and agents all going through this extremely difficult process of trying to buy a house when there are 50 other bids and, you know, half of them are all cash. And, you know, the open house lines are around the block. And so I did talk to house owners luckily nobody who was really to go quite to the extremes that Margo goes to in the book. But, you know, it was very normal at that time to, you know, write letters, write emotional letters with your own or to do things to try to get in the back door to like try to, you know, you would circle the neighborhood and see what that house is really is really cool. Maybe I'll just go knock on the door and see if there's any chance to sell it to me because you know, there was such a shortage of inventory. There still is a big inventory problem as your audience knows. So there were these things that were kind of like that were very normal to do, but that walked right up to the edge of like being too far. So when I decided to write the book, I thought, well, I'm just going to let my main character, because this is fiction now, she is going to take it over that line into the to I've gotten too far. Charatory. Yeah, I love that and so much of humor is taking a simple premise and then exaggerating it right and so that's that's essentially what the Margo character is is this idea of going in and doing some, you know, routine sort of looking up online of how what the maybe the motivations of these of the sellers might be and who they are so I can gain a slight advantage. And then you know, ramping that up and escalating that up into where it becomes absurd in her efforts and what what a funny thing. So I see it as this dark comedy and also a thriller when you started writing it, was it more of a comedy or more of a thriller at first? Were you sure or did you want to marry those two at the same time? So I, the first idea that I had was the twist that comes late in the book. So I can't tell you what that is about that would ruin the book, but the twist is very much thriller. Right. So that was so I guess I if we're talking about, you know, where what was the first where did I actually start from? I started from the twist. So I guess that was that that would be like starting from the point of the thriller. But I also knew I wanted more I wanted the main character to not be like you're traditionally like a bull main character. Like I knew she was going to be like, you know, she was going to be like a Walter White like a behaving badly main character who hopefully you would still decide that you want to tag along with for the whole ride anyway and maybe even start to root for even as she does like really despicable things. So I thought, you know, a way to make her even if you're appalled by what she's doing. I still wanted you to maybe like her. So to me humor was the way into that. So she does have a pretty darkly funny in her monologues that you get to be privy to as as the reader. You know, in particular because what we're talking about is buying she's she her budget is $1.3 million. She's buying a nice, you know, pretty nice, you know, high end home. She comes herself from very humble beginnings and is very self made. So she's now a PR she's a publicist in the DC area her husband's a government lawyer. So she has made this life for herself unlike a lot of the people that she sees around her who, you know, from her point of view had had everything candid to them like there, you know, trust fund, you know, kids who have all cash, you know, from their parents to put down on a house. They all went to the right Ivy League schools, but she did not. So you are privy to the way she is kind of for seeming to people around her. And so there is a lot of commentary on the sort of class that comes along with the book. And she just feels like she's had to work, you know, 10 times as hard as all these people. So she's owed this house. And she's going to have to like take matters into her own hands to get it. Yeah, I love that. You know, it's funny. I just started my fiance and I started. We said, let's read a book together that just do something together. And so we run. Yeah, yeah, we she was talking about joining a book club. And then she's like, I don't know if I have time for that. Like we could just do a book club ourselves. Yeah, so my husband and my husband and I sometimes do that. And it's fun because then you have to move to talk about. Well, we just started reading. What what are we reading? Agatha Christie's and then there was none, which we used to be telling the Indians, right, which I see a lot of Agatha Christie. I don't know if she was a major inspiration for you, but she is darkly funny, darkly funny. I mean, one of just the funniest writers. And obviously she's more mystery than thriller, but that thriller too, I guess. And so I see a little bit of that. I don't know if she was one of one of your heroes. But it certainly seems as you're talking, you know, just the way that she writes. So I guess that's I guess that's a nice compliment. Well, that is a huge compliment. I will say even, you know, I think Agatha Christie's work is just so sort of in the culture now that even if you don't realize she was an influence, she probably was. I mean, I think there are you can see threads of Agatha Christie in a lot of really successful modern commercial thrillers. So yeah, she probably did work her way in there somewhere. Who were who were your fiction heroes growing up? So, oh gosh, well, you know, as I already said, like I didn't ever think I was going to be an author. So I a lot of a lot of my writing heroes were more were actually more nonfiction. That's where I was focused. Like I'm a huge David David Grand fan. I don't know if you know him. He's a New Yorker writer, but he's written a couple of few books that are like historical nonfiction, but they're so good that they read like novels. But I will say when I was thinking about creating a female protagonist who does some bad things, I definitely did think a lot about gone girl. And the character of Amy Dunn, I would say I don't think Margot is Margot and Amy Dunn are very different, but they are the same and that they are not afraid to really like go the extra mile for what they want. But what do you think the book says about status status neighborhoods? Let's talk about that because that's a big theme in the book. Like who gets in who gets priced out, you know, who gets judged. There's a lot of that in here. So tell us talk about status. Yeah, for sure. So Margot, as I already mentioned, she comes from the sort of working class background. She definitely has like a bit of a chip on her shoulder because of that and like I think a little bit of an inferiority complex. And so I think she sees this sort of Instagram perfect life as like the thing that will make her valuable. So she wants the perfect house and the perfect, you know, the perfect marriage. She's also been, she's trying to have a baby and her and her husband are dealing with some infertility issues, which further add to her, you know, already really high stress level. But she wants the perfect baby. She wants all she wants what she perceives or maybe more, maybe more specifically what she thinks the outside world perceives as the perfect life. And that will then mean that she herself has arrived. So she wants to achieve a certain level of status in the book. Because that's the messaging that's being directed at her, you know, from Pinterest and from Instagram. And I do think there is a there's been a heightening of that because of social media for sure. I mean, I don't know that I actually would be really curious to know what most real estate agents would say about that because I think, you know, there probably was a time when no one was watching HDTV. And no one was, you know, scrolling all of the beautiful design account on Instagram. And so maybe they didn't know if they wanted to ask for, you know, unlackered brass fixtures in every bad moment, you know, all of these things that now are these kind of status symbols. Well, I think to, you know, speaking of social media, I think it has certainly made real estate more popular in sort of the ethos of what we look at and because there's an aesthetic to it that I think, you know, social media and Instagram in particular, you know, just is very sort of obviously attracted to. And I think also too, there's the idea of perfection is really kind of like what's the aesthetic ideal is what we see a lot on, of course, well now with AI making everything perfect, including ourselves, our homes, our meals. And it really is, it's really an interesting sort of thing that we never had before. So there's always, you know, there's Photoshop has been around for maybe 30 years, but it wasn't quite, you know, that sort of that technology wasn't pushed in our face every 10 seconds as we scroll. And now we're seeing it everywhere. And so there's this idea that we have to look a certain way that we have to have a home that looks a certain way or we have to at least make our home look a certain way when we're presenting it to others online, right, there's this idea that our lives have to look perfect and I think, you know, we have to win this sort of status race. And can you talk a little bit about that like how has, I mean, what do you think, where do you think we're headed with this idea of everything being so, so perfect, curious, just what your thoughts are there. I don't know if I can predict the future, but I will say that exactly what you're describing is part of the immense pressure that Margot feels in the book and that then that she's very much cracking it. I mean, she's experiencing a real mental break in this book, whether she herself realizes it or not, but definitely all of this pressure that she's, you know, this imagery that you were talking about that gets fed to us. I mean, the fact that it just looks, you know, I think people start to think it's very normal to have a perfect looking hat. I mean, that's like what you need. What's that's like the standard that you have to meet because everybody on Instagram looks like their life is perfect and no, and of course, what you don't see on Instagram are all of the outtakes, you know, that are not perfect. So yeah, so Margot is very much cracking under that pressure. You know, where do I think we're going from here? I mean, God, unfortunately, you mentioned AI, AI is only becoming more and more pervasive. So I don't think this problem is going to go away. But like, you know, like I told you a minute ago that I'm 40 and what, you know, what I really started to kind of think about is how no one really knows what a 40 year old looks like anymore. Right. You know, because there's so much there's that we mean if you're not actually getting, you know, injected or filled or whatever in real life, like you can have the Instagram filter that makes you look like you have been. So I'm like, what am I supposed to like what what what is it actually mean to look your age anymore. So it's sort of the same pressure. But but with that those same pressures and those same like kind of Instagram perfect filters are also applied to the housing. Yeah, I do see I do see another novel for you where a 40 year old woman rejects all of the perfectionist sort of technology. And says I'm going to exist in this world as I am and sort of the way that people react to her treat her. I think I think that would would make for a well certainly funny premise, but really something that would speak to a lot of people at that stage of life, especially women. And we know what Instagram does to young girls, but the time of your teen, it's really bad. But but certainly for women who are at that stage of life and as adults, I think gosh, it's got to be it's got to not be fun to think like, oh, I don't I don't look the I don't look how I feel that I'm supposed to look, which is such a thing that shouldn't matter. Yeah, and the bar and the bar keeps moving, which is so it's just like an unwinnable. It feels like an unwinnable battle. Women have it tough and I think women have it. I mean, we know why we know that women have it tough, but women have to be so much more, I think. And I think social media is really made this more challenging for women in particular, because you you are seeing these women living these at least perceived amazingly idealized lives, right? Where they're doing especially real a lot of really successful real estate, REALTOR's who are women really try to showcase this life of look at how I'm a perfect mother. I'm a perfect REALTOR. I go to the gym every morning. I have this perfect latte or or you know my food is per its incredibly must be exhausting to showcase that kind of lifestyle. They do it for maybe branding reasons. But there is this pressure, I think, for all of us, but certainly women adult women to be seen as I can do everything. Yeah. And I think that is that's I think that's problematic, right? Yeah. And certainly again, I don't know if this is intentionally or not, but you're definitely hitting on a big theme in the book, which is that you know there's a lot of female rage in this book. Yeah. Margo has this like really like kind of constantly simmering rage within her that propels her to do a lot of these horrible things. But I think that rage for for Margo is in large part of products of all of this pressure that she feels. And so she's just decided that she's going to lean really hard into that rage now and let it carry her. Now as you're writing about this character and you're so used to writing about real people in the journalism world. Did there was there ever any point where as Margo's becoming more and more unhinged wanting this property that you started to see parts of yourself in Margo, or was there ever a thought of like, oh, I, this is coming from my brain. I sort of you know, you write what you know, right? So I don't know how much of that you could identify. Well, I will say that Margo and I do not share the same views on a lot of things, but for sure I relate to her rage and I felt it was actually very cathartic to get to write that part of the character because you know, I think if you're like a sentient woman in today's world, you do feel some anger. And so to get to, but you can't have it, you know, in life society, we don't get to act on it. It's the way that Margo does in the book, so to allow a fictional character to really go full tilt right into that anger was really, really fun and. And yeah, yeah, so I do that there absolutely. There is a lot of me and Margo for sure. I think that's important for us to realize too, just in society is that women, another thing that we really don't encourage them to do is to be angry. We don't like, we don't like men are allowed to be angry, right? We're allowed to be angry, but women are often not. And so this idea of, you know, of course women are, you know, they're human beings. They have anger. It's normal. It's healthy actually. And the idea of speaking to women's anger, I think is really important. And so I'm glad that, you know, you're tackling it in a funny way and over the top way at times. But I think it's really important for us to recognize that, you know, it is tough for women to be able to express their anger. It's certainly in public or, or, you know, it's just not perceived as, you know, the ideal for which is completely insane. Obviously, men aren't supposed to cry and women aren't supposed to get angry, right? That's true. Yes, thankfully that's changing. I believe, but, but I'm glad that you're speaking to this because it is something that that a lot of women can relate to, especially like as REALTORS, they have to stay calm under pressure. They're not supposed to, I have a woman who is one of the most successful agents in Chicago. She comes on my show often and she's beloved. I mean, she's a lovely human being. She will say, you cannot believe how people talk to me, even though she's been in this business 20 plus years and she is as sweet as, I mean, she's tough. She should be, but she's absolutely fair and honest and she will say, in particular, the way men will speak to her. She, she doesn't complain about it. She's just like, just so you know, and I'm like, yeah, it's amazing to me that that happens. And it's like, oh yeah, as men, we forget that a lot of times that, you know, women really have, it's tough. It's tough to be a woman in business. It's tough to be a woman who's who's assertive. I think that is just just difficult in general. And it's something that as men, we need to be more compassionate towards. Oh, yes. Well, that's good on you for saying that. I, you know, I do think Margo was cathartic for me to write. And I do think it's because I mean, hopefully cathartic for a lot of women to read that character too. Because, yeah, Margo is a very successful professional woman, but also trying to be a mom, also trying to, you know, keep the marriage intact. And yeah, she is trying to have it all, you know, which is a thing. It's so funny, you know, no one really ever says to men, you should try to have it all. But women get fed this message pretty regularly that we have to try to have it all, which is an insane thing to try to have. No one can actually, you know, really have it all and maintain any kind of a balance. So, so yes, Margo's cracking up that pressure, you know, I certainly have felt that pressure myself in my own life. I know my friends have, you know, I think any working professional woman has felt this has felt this way. Oh, yeah. Usmen, we get other bad messages. We don't get that one. We get other ones that are, that are, you know, equally awful, but, but not not in the same way. And I think I think it's important for, you know, real estate agents, 67% of them are women. So it's important for us to really even have this conversation in a sort of lighthearted way. But, but also it's it's important to know that especially women REALTORS who are supposed to be just so perfect. And again, it's it's it's a it's unfortunately something that that, you know, needs to be sort of considered. And of course, you know, it's funny. You're talking about social media. Whenever I see somebody who has the courage to post something imperfect and I don't mean they. You know, somebody catches them slipping or falling or something silly, but more like they're having a really bad day and they post about, you know, something that is imperfect. Maybe they're, you know, something happened or that they're wish to share, but it's so courageous. And it's interesting that sometimes people will look down on those people who post that stuff saying, oh, look, now they're aiming for sympathy. And it's like, well, you can't have it both ways, right? We can't have this idea that you only post the beauty and not sort of the the imperfections of life and then shame the person for for sharing what's actually more human and real. And so I love that your book, you know, really goes into that more human in real side. And again, obviously in an exaggerated state, but but something that that we all have those thoughts and we all have those imperfections and everybody's got problems that everybody's on the verge of, you know, committing a crime in their mind and just trying to realize, okay, I'm not going to go out and do that, but I did think that. And that's, and that's perfectly okay. Let's talk about, you know, sort of what do you think this book gets right about buyer emotions? Well, I do think and I feel like I'm really preaching the choir here given who your audience is, but I do think that when you're buying a house, it feels like the most important thing in the whole universe. I mean, I really do think that, you know, especially if you're if you're buying in a in a seller's market where it's very competitive, you know, I think you get blinders on and you just nothing else matters. I mean, and with with with good reason, because for most people, it is the most money they're ever going to spend on anything. But I also think it's not only financial stake, it's emotional stake. So I think, you know, everybody sort of brings their own sort of personal baggage to what it means to be a homeowner and what it mean, what a dream home means. So that is a big theme in the book also. Margo comes from a family that had a pretty challenged relationship with homeownership. And that's a big driver for her. And she sort of wants to go out now and create for herself the dream life that she feels, you know, her parents were we're not able to provide for her. She feels like she was sort of deprived of that growing up, whereas her husband Ian comes from this very sort of, you know, kind of nice, you know, salt to the earth midwestern family where he grew up, you know, when a nice, you know, in a loving, you know, stable home. So what I wanted to explore through their dynamic was this idea of all of the emotional kind of personal baggage that people bring to the house hunt because it's very different for these two people in this marriage. I mean, Margo is so dead set on getting the dream house. She really feels like it's the thing that's missing in her life. And she's got it and she really is convinced that if she doesn't go out and grab it for herself, and you know, it's not just going to happen for her. She's going to have to work really hard for it, whereas Ian, you know, is sort of just like it's all going to work out kind of guy like he's like, you know, if it's meant to be, it'll have this one, you know, if this house is meant to be ours, we'll get it like that's his attitude. And it's driving Margo crazy, you know, so that she's sort of having to carry the bulk of the stress of the house hunt. But what it comes down to is that they come from these very different backgrounds where, you know, Ian just doesn't feel the same urgency and the same hunger for this that Margo does. And I think that I mean, I do think, you know, based on having bought, you know, home myself and also having been a reporter talking to real life homeowners, I do think that I, I the book does get that part right about about the house hunt. Yeah, often one party or one person in the by side wants it a little bit more or it's more important that they win that then maybe the other person. And that becomes challenging for the relationship. It's challenging for the for the REALTOR. And it's it's it's tough because that person who is so invested really wants the their partner if they're, you know, if they have a partner to feel the same way. And it can be very frustrating to have the other person go like, I will find something else. It's fine. Yeah, or maybe even if it's not like relationship drama, even if it's just, you know, when I was a kid, you know, the most, the most beautiful house on my block with a Cape Cod. And that is what is it. That's a dream house to me. And that's what I want. That's the only kind of house I want, you know, like even if it's just stuff like that. I do think we all bring our own emotional personal histories to homes to, you know, being a homeowner is so connected with the American dream for better for worse. And so I think we we just put so much weight onto it onto the house. Yeah, I do. I wanted to get I really just have one last question for you because this is a hot topic in real estate. Some argue for REALTORS in particular not not for the public, but some argue this could be a fair housing violation. Some states say don't do it. Now as a consumer, this, this they wouldn't know this, but this idea of writing a love letter to the sellers. So what's your, what's your view on the love letter? Is it romantic? Is it manipulative? Is it both? You know, what do you think about love letters? So I will say I have never written one myself, but I did when we sold our last house, we received some love, a couple of letters. And my agent told me not to read them because he was like, you should not let this. Sure. Let's we should just let everyone be on an equal playing field and we're just going to look at the bottom line kind of what the closing terms are. And I'm really glad that he told me that because after we did, you know, after we picked, you know, the buyer and we sold the house, I did go back and look at a couple of those. And I think I don't know that it would have changed the outcome, but I would have just felt, you know, guilty or for not having sold to this lovely couple with an adorable new puppy. And you know what I mean? Like I, so I don't, I, from the seller's perspective, I just, I don't see a world in which I would ever read them. From the buyer's side, I mean, I don't know. I think if you, if you, if you feel like that's survived, you want, like if that's what you want to do, I mean, I, who am I to tell you what, what not to do. But yeah, I mean, certainly, I think if you're saying, I do see how it could become a fair housing violation, depending on the kind of information you're including in the letter, for sure. Well, yeah, yeah, we're not saying does it work or not? It works. It's just should, should it be done? Should it be allowed? Well, yeah, right, right. Is, is the idea that, and I think your agent gave you great advice when you were, you know, when you were selling, just, you know, don't pay attention to this because it will, of course, we're humanable influence us. Yeah. And it will influence us in a way that's probably unfair to the other people looking at again, whether that's legal or not is, is a different question. But it is, it is an interesting tactic because we know it's effective. And yet, the sort of the REALTOR boards are trying real estate boards trying to figure out is, is, is there an ethical issue here that violates, you know, some of the standards that, that agents are attempting to maintain. But it is funny. I'm glad you included it because especially during the pandemic, that's when, you know, we saw a lot of that. And, and it was interest rates were so low that buyers were just out and everybody was competing. And as you said, you, you, you live through those times as well. So I am really wanting everybody to go pick up this book, you know, as agents, you'll love it. You'll, you'll get it. And this is absolutely in your wheelhouse of experience. And if nothing else, it'll just be a cathartic moment for you because everybody's had a crazy client. And everybody's had a listing where there was a crazy buyer or, you know, that, and so this is a great opportunity for you to connect with a, another, you know, someone who has validated this experience, in a fictional way and had a lot of fun with it. And you'll smile and laugh along the way as you go through this, this sort of, you know, emotional roller coaster of, of, of want versus, you know, versus outcome, I guess. And, and what people are willing to do to, to get there and, and to achieve the status that we all, you know, at times think like, oh, that's, that's where the happiness is. If I just get the thing, then I will be happy. And it's so interesting to when, when you see sort of the data on, unhappiness, I think that's, you know, talk about dream homes. And the data on happiness is really interesting where it's like once you, with salary, once you get above your basic needs and you can, you know, you're not worried about money every month. Happiness doesn't really go up as much as income goes up. It really stays fairly steady for you make, you know, $100,000 or a million dollars. It's not much different below that. Yes, there, there's a lot of unhappiness, but it's interesting. So it's a good reminder for all of us to think about, you know, what really brings us happiness. You know, is it that thing that I don't have yet? Is it that achievement? Is it that, that item that I want to buy? And, and, you know, what are we going? What are we really looking for? And for most of us is we're looking for connection or looking for, you know, relationships and things like that. So I think this book touches on all of that. So I'm really hoping that our audience goes out and picks this up. It's a bestseller. It's, you know, it's maybe I'm going to be on television someday and Marissa has has really just become part of this conversation. And so we're so happy to have you. The book is best offer wins, find it anywhere books are sold. Certainly pick it up on Amazon. If you'd like, oh, and there's an audiobook version as well. Do you recommend if people were to choose one or the other? What do you think? Do you like the audiobook version? I mean, I think I think you can't go wrong here. Sorry, here's the cover. I've got to do my little promo. Please. I mean, I love a hardcover book. I'm personally like I like to read the real book, but if you're an audiobook person, I think the audio book is super fun. And that was actually a really fun thing that I got to be a part of was the auditions for the person that for the voice actress. And she a court is the actor who reads the audiobook and she just totally knocked out of the park. You can not go wrong. We have a lot of audiobook listeners who are REALTORS because they listen as they're driving from. Oh, for sure. Yeah. Yeah. Definitely consider if that's works better for you, check that out on Audible. And again, Marissa is our guest. She is what's next? You have another novel in you? Yes. Well, gosh, I sure hope so because this is my job now. I do have another novel in the works. It's not real estate specific like the first one, but it is similar in tone. Another dark comedy thriller takes place at least partially in the DC area. So yes, the station for that one. I love it. Well, follow Marissa on her Instagram, which is Marissa, because she know which is K. A. S. H. I. and oh, and we'll have a link to her Instagram as well as the book on our show notes.
