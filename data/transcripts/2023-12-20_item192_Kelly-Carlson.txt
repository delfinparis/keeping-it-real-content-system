[00:02:29] Hey, today on the show, our guest is Kelly Carlson with Kelly Carlson homes at properties,
[00:02:39] Christie's International real estate here in Chicago.
[00:02:43] Let's tell you more about Kelly.
[00:02:44] Now Kelly Carlson is an award winning broker with at properties in Christie's International
[00:02:48] real estate in their Western Springs office.
[00:02:51] That's a suburb of Chicago.
[00:02:53] Now after launching her real estate career in the city in 2020, after four plus years
[00:02:59] in consulting, Kelly was named Engle and Volcker Chicago rookie of the year.
[00:03:04] And more recently recognized as a member.
[00:03:06] And this is such a big deal of the National Association of REALTORS 30 under 30 class
[00:03:12] of 2023 just to let people know what that is every year.
[00:03:16] The National Association of REALTORS wants to find the agents who are in their 20s who
[00:03:22] are doing really exceptional things in the industry and having exceptional success as
[00:03:26] well and highlighting them.
[00:03:28] And she was one of the award winners this year with a love of interior design, historical
[00:03:34] homes and do it yourself updates.
[00:03:36] This career is the perfect blend of her passions and professional background.
[00:03:40] And she's no longer doing the consultants Monday to Thursday fly out and then back on
[00:03:46] the weekends so she gets to stay here in Chicago more often.

[00:04:00] We will have links to both all of her social media in our show notes.
[00:04:05] Kelly, welcome to the show.
[00:04:06] Thank you so much for having me DJ.
[00:04:08] This is such a pinch me moment when I was in the process of getting my license.
[00:04:13] I was bingeing all of your old episodes in 2020.
[00:04:16] So very cool, full circle moment to be here.
[00:04:19] Well it is an honor to have one of our listeners on the show and yeah, excited to chat.
[00:04:28] It's always fun when when people find us or we find people and I'm just so grateful
[00:04:34] that you're here and you have done some really exceptional things.
[00:04:37] I am also curious.
[00:04:40] So I know you're a university of Illinois grad.
[00:04:42] Did you go straight into consulting right out of school?
[00:04:45] Was that kind of your path?
[00:04:47] Yes, and it was kind of one of those you get recruited in the fall of your senior year
[00:04:52] and then started in October after graduating.
[00:04:55] So had a nice long summer vacation and then it was really time to get to work.
[00:05:01] And did you have that consultants life where you were traveling to clients during the week
[00:05:05] coming back on the weekends?
[00:05:06] Was that kind of how you started?
[00:05:09] I was not every Monday through Thursday, but my particular consulting group did have
[00:05:15] a lot of special projects.
[00:05:17] So it took me to a lot of remote locations across the US.
[00:05:22] So I had great airline status at that point and that is probably the one thing I missed.
[00:05:28] Yeah, no more instant first class upgrades.
[00:05:32] My sister lost that as well.
[00:05:35] She's now with a startup prior to that.
[00:05:37] She wasn't a consultant, but she used to travel for different jobs and now she's lost all of that.
[00:05:42] And she still occasionally gets it upgrade, but it is we laugh and go,
[00:05:45] oh great, you're just like the rest of us now, which we love.
[00:05:49] So why the switch from consulting to very few people, I think get out of consulting
[00:05:55] because it is such a really it's a wonderful career and track.
[00:05:59] It really truly is.
[00:06:01] It's not of course the travel stinks, but ultimately a lot of people stay in it.
[00:06:06] So I'm curious what was so why did you get out and why real estate?
[00:06:10] Sure.
[00:06:11] Well, this story kind of goes back to I want to say high school college because I had always had
[00:06:17] a love for architecture homes.
[00:06:20] I took every CAD class in my high school went to a pre architecture camp at U of I.
[00:06:27] And ultimately when I was kind of in that phase of applying to schools,
[00:06:31] it was still end of recession.
[00:06:34] Residential architecture was not necessarily the place to find a job at the time.
[00:06:39] So I thought, well, I like math and science.
[00:06:41] I'll do civil engineering, which is a complimentary field to architecture.
[00:06:48] And so did that at U of I great kind of versatile degree.
[00:06:52] I knew I didn't want to do traditional design engineering.
[00:06:57] And so I started looking into consulting, which is a route that a lot of engineering
[00:07:02] graduates go into.
[00:07:04] So that seemed to be a nice mix of getting to work with people, client services,
[00:07:09] but also relevance, my degree.
[00:07:12] And so yeah, I did that for four years, starting at a big for firm and then moved on to
[00:07:17] a smaller boutique management consulting firm.
[00:07:20] I could not think of a better place to watch my career.
[00:07:24] It really taught me the value of exceptional client service and how to be professional,
[00:07:31] how to manage a very demanding schedule and still meet deadlines.
[00:07:36] But I got to a point where I, you know, I'd been at two firms.
[00:07:41] I didn't see myself in it for the long haul and didn't think that going to another company
[00:07:46] was going to, you know, solve what I felt like was missing.
[00:07:50] And so it kind of brought me back to that place of, you know, I've always loved
[00:07:55] real estate architecture that has just always fascinated me.
[00:07:59] And the voice in my head previously had always been
[00:08:02] but you went to school for engineering and you're a consultant.
[00:08:05] And this is what you do.
[00:08:06] But I started to think about it differently in terms of how could I leverage this experience
[00:08:12] in the corporate world to differentiate myself as somebody, you know, I didn't have a
[00:08:16] sales background, but I had a lot of transferable skills for a totally services business.
[00:08:22] And so I did it.
[00:08:24] I quit my job in October of 2020, got my license and got hit the ground running in January of 2021.
[00:08:33] Right, right smack dab in the middle of the pandemic.
[00:08:35] Yeah, perfect timing.
[00:08:39] That is incredible. And then for you to have enough success to catch the eye of the National
[00:08:46] Association of REALTORS for their 30 under 30 is quite a big deal. I know many, many people,
[00:08:53] friends of mine who have not made that list and have tried many times. A lot of my friends have
[00:08:59] made the list as well. But boy, it's a big feather in your cap. So congratulations. I'm excited
[00:09:04] to learn more about maybe what they they see in you as well. And I think civil engineering too
[00:09:10] is a really nice transferable skill. And I know again, that wasn't really your career,
[00:09:15] but it was your your field of study and interest because civil engineers, you know, people don't
[00:09:20] really know what that is. Just one one one thing that civil engineers do is they they're really
[00:09:25] good at visualizing. So they can see like two points of land and they can visualize a bridge across
[00:09:30] or like if there's a river in between or something they can they can visualize things that aren't
[00:09:35] there and then they can bring those things to life. So I imagine even just that skill along with
[00:09:40] your architecture knowledge and love of of of homes and interior design probably is pretty helpful
[00:09:46] when you're maybe walking a client through a home saying I you can probably see things that maybe
[00:09:53] I wouldn't be able to see for example, I'm just curious if that ever comes up where or maybe
[00:09:57] it's a renovation you're able to maybe visualize that more effectively than you know,
[00:10:02] somebody without those skills. Yes, that has definitely been helpful on the renovation front.
[00:10:08] The home that we're sitting in I'm sitting in right now is actually the home that my husband and I
[00:10:14] just bought and did not look like this a few months ago and there was a lot of work to get into
[00:10:19] this place. And so something I was able to do for myself, but then also for my clients who are
[00:10:27] maybe struggling in the current low inventory market not able to find that move in ready home or
[00:10:33] they've got to kind of grow into it knowing what is in place and what can be done over time.
[00:10:40] Yeah, it's funny if you're watching this you'll see you're probably listening so you won't see
[00:10:45] this but Kelly has an all white kitchen. I also although you won't see this on mine because I'm
[00:10:49] at the office, but I have an all white kitchen and we were talking to her laughing about that earlier
[00:10:54] and I just I have all white everything white walls white, you know, I'm like really all white
[00:11:00] white and black and I'm thinking like in it'll be funny in like 10 years when people are like why
[00:11:06] were people doing all white like what you know like it's cool now but it won't be cool forever so
[00:11:12] it is kind of funny how how styles evolve and change over time. But let's talk about how you
[00:11:19] built your business because yes, I think the consulting background every consultant I know
[00:11:24] in the big four, you know professionalism hard work meeting deadlines and just being of service.
[00:11:31] You talked about customer service or really sort of the main pillars and being a good listener I
[00:11:35] think consultants are great listeners as well, but they you know those those are really important
[00:11:40] skills that obviously transfer over in real estate, but you still had to build your business. People
[00:11:45] see you as a saw you as a consultant that was your your profession and a very well respected
[00:11:50] profession and then you know that that was your path and then all of a sudden you're pivoting
[00:11:54] was it challenging to you know introduce your sphere of influence to your new career or was like
[00:12:01] what was that process like? Sure so as you know after I got licensed I started interviewing at
[00:12:08] different brokerages and met Jennifer Ames who is a top-led-easing Chicago agent also the
[00:12:16] licensed partner of angle and vulgar Chicago in Lincoln Park and her and I connected and she
[00:12:23] had had a previous career prior to real estate as well and so once I did get my license I was so
[00:12:29] excited to come over to her company and you know unlike a lot of new agents they start out on a team
[00:12:38] and they learn from that team member and they help out and it's a great way to get experience
[00:12:43] but the unique thing about angle and vulgar at the time is their boutique firm and Jenny had told me
[00:12:49] she's you know if you come over you can be a solo agent and we will help you we will give you
[00:12:55] those tools and so that was something that you know I was so grateful for her mentorship and being
[00:13:01] able to get started as a solo agent but under you know having the experience of getting to cover
[00:13:08] open houses and that was a huge part of building my business outside of you know making sure
[00:13:16] and this is a big thing that I have been taught is don't be a secret agent like make sure that your
[00:13:22] fear of influence knows you know that you are in real estate and this is a full-time serious
[00:13:28] career for you so I think I took advantage of you know social media and a newsletter and
[00:13:37] just connecting with people I now had more time to be able to call up friends and people I
[00:13:43] knew from college to go grab coffee because I wasn't traveling and so it was kind of a mix of
[00:13:50] just offering out all of my weekends to do open houses for any agents in our office and then
[00:13:56] working with you know friends and friends of friends over time you know I say that first year
[00:14:03] was a lot more friends and family open house buyers and then over time it kind of I think you know
[00:14:10] I had done a good job with those friends that they felt comfortable referring me to their friends
[00:14:15] and family so over time it's become more referral based but I'd say you know if you're a new agent
[00:14:21] like don't be afraid to let your people know that this is your career and let it you know you
[00:14:29] talked about open houses I feel like agents don't do newer agents may not know depending on what
[00:14:36] firm they're at or who their circle is that they know of other agents but if you work in an office
[00:14:42] where there are agents with listings and I you know not there are small firms with just a couple
[00:14:48] of brokers so this might not apply to everyone but if there is someone in your office with at least
[00:14:51] one listing I would go and ask beg plead and and do anything you can to get in their good graces
[00:14:58] if you're a brand new agent to sit in open house can you tell us that's my suggestion what would
[00:15:04] you recommend do you do you agree or you know what has your experience with open houses 100% I my
[00:15:11] actual my first buyer client was from the first open house that I held and that's not how it
[00:15:17] goes every time you know there are going to be times where you sit in an empty condo for two hours
[00:15:22] and you know scroll your phone or check emails but other times you might connect really well with
[00:15:30] somebody and I'd say just you know asking questions trying to get to know a person see what information
[00:15:38] you can learn about them because then when you are following up you aren't going to be like that
[00:15:43] 12th agent who is sending them the same email saying do you want to buy this kind of or do you
[00:15:48] work with me on something else I think trying to create some kind of personal connection
[00:15:56] is can can make a difference and that was the case with my first buyer client they were so impressed
[00:16:02] by how much I remembered from our five minute conversation so it goes back to that listening I think
[00:16:09] yeah I think you're right and something to consider it so the first step of course is getting
[00:16:14] getting an open house when you don't have a listing which you know beg the people in your firm
[00:16:19] to help you do that and then when you have people walking through the open house Kelly what I heard
[00:16:24] from you is pay very very close attention to what they tell you and maybe even take notes after
[00:16:29] they leave because and I was thinking about this as you were saying I was like why would you be the
[00:16:33] eighth person that maybe another real eight other REALTORS might be and I go oh because they're
[00:16:38] going to other open houses like it just occurred to me oh yeah of course they are and so of course
[00:16:42] they're going to get eight follow-up messages from thanks for coming to my open house and if you
[00:16:47] can add in you know whatever the conversation was yeah all of a sudden now you're you stand above
[00:16:53] everyone else definitely but it's a win-win for the listing agents too because yeah like you said
[00:17:00] they've got maybe multiple listings and they can't be in two places at once so it's not as a staff
[00:17:06] it doesn't hurt to ask and also in many cases it really makes the seller look good to the
[00:17:11] or sorry makes the selling agent look good to the seller or the listing agent I should say
[00:17:16] because I technically the selling agent is the one who buys them anyway I don't know why they
[00:17:20] we do it that way it's too confusing I know I'm sorry I'm sorry but anyway I don't make the rules
[00:17:29] so sorry for the confusion there but yeah for for anyone for anyone who you know it is a listing
[00:17:34] agent you know we know that oftentimes by asking a listing agent hey can I sit in open house for
[00:17:40] your property they get to then say to the seller hey we're gonna do an open house and of course
[00:17:44] that just makes the seller think that the listing agent's doing stuff and that's a good thing too so
[00:17:49] it really is a win-win for everybody obviously for the agent sitting the open house if nobody shows up
[00:17:54] and you know that is always a bummer but it happens but the important thing is these are where people
[00:18:00] do come into open houses and I know that you know we live in so much of a virtual world now but I
[00:18:05] encourage everyone if you're if you're if you're not slammed with appointments these days I would be
[00:18:10] asking every listing agent I know in my office can I please please please come sit in open house
[00:18:15] and okay cool so so let's talk I want to talk about social media because I'm 47 and I used to be
[00:18:21] I used to feel like I was a young guy I'm not a young guy anymore but I would you know social media
[00:18:29] is just kind of a different animal for people who are in your case you're like about 20 years younger
[00:18:34] tell us a little bit about how you've built your business on social I'm just curious on
[00:18:39] what's worked for you how do you think about content you know what how are you in the you know how
[00:18:44] are you posting tell us about that sure you know initially I had thought you know you have to be
[00:18:51] on every single platform and just you know reach everybody from every direction and I started to
[00:18:59] learn that I think age is a big part of figuring out what you're where your demographic is and for
[00:19:06] me at 29 I'd save most of my year and people my age are still on Instagram Facebook not so much
[00:19:15] TikTok I don't have I probably should but I just I'm afraid I get too addicted but that's been kind
[00:19:23] of the biggest social media piece for me I haven't business account but I like to mix in
[00:19:30] still some personal with that I you will probably never see me post a just listed or just sold
[00:19:37] post well no hold on what why is that why do you not post those because you know I my kind of
[00:19:47] thought process as I'm deciding you know to put together some form of content my question
[00:19:53] is is this that value to the consumer and when I saw those and when I see them you know it's
[00:19:59] kind of just it doesn't do much for me however if I see you know a picture of a couple in front
[00:20:06] of a house and there's a story behind it I'm interested and it gives me more of the taste of
[00:20:12] you know who that agent is and how they work and so I love you know on occasion to share client
[00:20:19] stories in that way and yes sure it's showing that you are you know selling homes and you know
[00:20:26] you're successful and all that but it's not so in your face so I think it goes back to the
[00:20:31] is it something that is adding value as we are fixing up a 1920s tutor I have been sharing
[00:20:40] some of our renovation journey because I personally love seeing before and after I think that
[00:20:47] content people generally enjoy and what it's kind of evolved into is going back to kind of helping
[00:20:53] people see what they can do with the space and also you know doing things depending on what your
[00:21:00] budget is you know here's places to splurge here's places to save so I found that to be kind of
[00:21:05] complimentary with you know posting normal real estate stuff too but I don't have a great you know
[00:21:13] like calendar anything of what I do I just when I have the time I you know come up with an idea
[00:21:20] and and post away I think that's really really great advice I'm not a fan of the just listed just
[00:21:26] sold stuff either I think it's perfectly okay to do it doesn't do much for me it doesn't necessarily
[00:21:33] turn me off when I see it but it doesn't light me up either like when I see somebody do it I
[00:21:38] in this I'm sort of not a good example because I see all my friends having success and I'm very
[00:21:44] excited to see them when they get their just listed just sold but if I was just a consumer not
[00:21:48] in this industry I'd be like yeah I don't I mean it's it'd be like the equivalent of you know
[00:21:53] somebody saying I just got us you know I just got this big sale at the company I work at and I
[00:21:59] close this big deal it's like we don't do that really we might tell our friends and family it
[00:22:04] close this big deal but we don't necessarily broadcast it but REALTORS do broadcast it and that's
[00:22:10] fine I'm not saying you shouldn't but it shouldn't I don't think it should be the primary I don't think
[00:22:14] anyone would say that should be the primary driver for what your content is I think people you're
[00:22:19] right are more interested in the story they're more interested in learning about you and kind of
[00:22:23] what you're into and also if you want to see really cool DIY before and after I encourage everybody
[00:22:31] go to Reddit and subscribe to the DIY subreddit it is awesome and there's like I think there's
[00:22:36] millions of people subscribe to it and you get to see all sorts of projects in there and there's
[00:22:41] the reason why millions of people are in there not everyone's a DIYer that's in there but they
[00:22:45] just love lurking and seeing so if you are somebody who does projects check out the DIY subreddit
[00:22:51] whether it's a home renovation or just something outside of real estate you could document a lot of
[00:22:57] that stuff put it in social and it just shows people that you have passion and interest and that
[00:23:01] you're kind of doing cool stuff so I am a big big believer in that as well so that's interesting so
[00:23:08] you're you're an Instagrammer more than anything TikTok's not your thing I stay away from TikTok
[00:23:13] I post our videos there but I don't browse TikTok for the exact reason you mentioned is I'm way
[00:23:18] to I have a way too much of an addictive personality and I would get lost in it in hours would go away
[00:23:23] so but whatever social media platform that that you know I think somebody is on is probably the one
[00:23:29] the one that they like the most is probably the one where where they should spend the most time
[00:23:34] but let's let's talk about so so you have this great apprenticeship sort of you know mentorship with
[00:23:40] one of the top producers here in Chicago and then you had to make a transition because you and your
[00:23:46] husband just bought this place out in the western suburbs you are not all that close to the city as
[00:23:51] you used to be used to be right in the city and what was that a bit of a transition as well for
[00:23:56] your business was it was the majority of your business in the city prior and how is that shifted
[00:24:02] as you've moved out west sure you know it's interesting because at my age late 20s a lot of my clients
[00:24:12] I think COVID kind of fed this up we're moving out of the city maybe earlier than they had would have
[00:24:20] been in the past and so I having grown up in the western suburbs cleared in hills I already had
[00:24:27] a pretty good knowledge of many of the western suburbs so I was able to help several buyers and
[00:24:33] some sellers out that way so for a good portion of my time in the city I was splitting my time
[00:24:40] a bit between western suburbs and the city so I'd say the transition wasn't it hasn't felt you
[00:24:49] crazy but I am now in a very you know hyper local market where most of the agents who do the business
[00:24:56] here live in town and part of that I started to learn very quickly is how many of the deals are
[00:25:04] happening off-market they don't even hit the private market they are happening you know just because
[00:25:09] there's word of mouth in town and so it kind of got me thinking that I would want to find a more
[00:25:17] local brokerage I had such an amazing experience that angle brokers and have nothing but amazing
[00:25:23] things to say about Jenny and the whole team but I quickly realized that you know being kind of
[00:25:29] the new girl in town and being with a brokerage that had a very strong local presence would be an
[00:25:35] important piece for establishing myself here long-term so I'm still trying to figure it out it's
[00:25:42] still somewhat new but I've got a really great business plan for 2024 and Trisha Roberto is
[00:25:49] the managing broker for App Properties, Hensdale and Western Spring and she's been so wonderful at
[00:25:56] getting me ready for this next year so yeah let's talk about this next year so what's on the marketing
[00:26:03] plan I am always interested on you know and again I know you talked about with social media you don't
[00:26:09] necessarily have a training calendar or sorry a content calendar but I'm curious on what kind of
[00:26:15] marketing efforts you plan to do to find additional buyers and sellers in 2024. Absolutely so my
[00:26:23] kind of big marketing campaign for 2024 I'm calling it going west buying your first home in
[00:26:31] Western suburbs so you know there's a lot of you know Chicago residents they're homeowner maybe
[00:26:40] they own their condo or they're renting they're ready for that move to the suburbs but they don't
[00:26:46] they're maybe not from the area and so they don't have that knowledge of you know if schools are
[00:26:52] important where you know how to navigate that commuting to downtown if they're still going to work
[00:26:58] in the city how to make that as easy as a transition as possible what you know what are the things
[00:27:04] they like to do in the city that they can still find some version of out this way and so so my focus
[00:27:11] is going to be helping with those first time suburban buyers and that'll be you know through kind
[00:27:18] of educational content on Instagram featuring different suburbs, local businesses etc but then also
[00:27:26] something I've started implementing is suburbs tours where I will take a client out
[00:27:31] privately for a couple of hours and both tour maybe you know five or six suburbs will drive around
[00:27:38] I will share you know kind of my take on how that local market is things that are notable about
[00:27:45] that town and I think it's a great way to get to know somebody before you start looking at homes
[00:27:52] but it's also I think a better way to get somebody out in your versus maybe trying to drag them to
[00:28:00] a happy hour at you know of downtown bar and western springs so that's that's a big part of me
[00:28:06] and in addition to kind of my typical you know newsletter you know I'd like to do quarterly
[00:28:12] client event at boutique fitness studios or maybe a fun local happy hour spot things like that.
[00:28:20] You just said something that really really sort of
[00:28:24] peaked my interest because I was trying to think as you were saying it I was like we've done over
[00:28:30] 500 episodes as anyone ever said this before and I don't think anyone has so I want to go back
[00:28:35] to something that you mentioned about these tours I think this is a brilliant idea and I we
[00:28:42] did not I did not know you were going to talk about this so I'm so excited because now I just got
[00:28:47] a click on my thoughts because here's what I was thinking I've never heard of anybody doing this so
[00:28:51] so typically you know you work with a REALTOR when you're ready to buy you already know approximately
[00:28:56] where you know the city you know maybe even the subdivision if you're out in the suburbs or
[00:29:01] the neighborhood if you're in the city whatever you have a general idea and we all hate when we get
[00:29:06] those buyers who call in and they go I'm open to anything and you're like oh now we got to figure
[00:29:11] this out but what I love about what you're doing is you're helping people make a decision of where
[00:29:16] they want to live not the home itself which you'll do a step two step one is probably the most
[00:29:24] challenging of the steps is where should we live and people normally go on that journey themselves
[00:29:30] they do not usually have a guide with them yeah maybe they're watching YouTube videos
[00:29:34] learning about different suburbs but they're not necessarily even being driven around to different
[00:29:39] suburbs going well here's some cool things about this one and here's some you know maybe not so
[00:29:43] cool things and here's this suburb and I mean that in Chicago we have I don't know how many
[00:29:48] suburbs like probably more than 50 altogether or villages and suburbs so it can be really I've
[00:29:54] lived here 21 years and I still don't really understand the suburbs and so that so that would be
[00:29:59] incredibly helpful for me if I was going to move out in the suburbs and I'm in this industry and I
[00:30:05] don't know I don't know you know anything about the suburbs and so that is such an important thing
[00:30:09] is really what here's what I heard you do you thought about what the need is what is the need well
[00:30:15] people who live in the city a lot of them move out to the suburbs because they want to start a family
[00:30:20] get more space whatever lots of reasons people typically move from urban to rural and so great so
[00:30:26] she Kelly knows this happens that's where you grew up as well and she thought well what's one of
[00:30:31] the challenges of that well picking a picking a place picking an area to live to move in and
[00:30:37] there's so many different options so I'm going to do these tours I am so impressed with that
[00:30:42] because that is an incredible service to provide and absolutely I would be I would be thrilled if I
[00:30:50] was living in Chicago and I was like well I got to move out to the suburbs I need more space and
[00:30:54] then I have to go on I got to figure out I got to look at all these suburbs I got as a huge thing
[00:30:59] and so for you to take somebody around or take a group of people around for a few hours amazing I
[00:31:05] can't imagine is I've never heard of anyone else doing that I'm sure other people do but it's
[00:31:10] got to be is that like a unique thing that you came up with yeah I was you know I was really
[00:31:16] struggling to brainstorm you know how do I get that type of person you know they're not going to
[00:31:22] take the train out here to come to an event of mine but I think I think like you said just kind
[00:31:29] of what is that need and how can I fill that and sure you are spending upfront kind of a lot of
[00:31:36] time upfront with a person but you know I think when you invest in somebody like that they're more
[00:31:43] likely to want to invest in you and it also I think can save some time on the back end because
[00:31:48] you aren't spending your wheel touring 10 different areas because they have no idea what they want
[00:31:55] yeah and if you even if you video some of it and not necessarily videoing the client you're taking
[00:32:01] out but if you take some quick little shots you can then put those together and create clips of
[00:32:07] like hey we we did a tour today we toured these four suburbs we showed you know we showed them
[00:32:13] the downtowns and the schools at whatever and you could actually make that into content as well
[00:32:18] and I would think you know that's a tremendous value that an agent can provide is you know this
[00:32:25] idea of being the gateway to the actual house I think is dev valued a little bit right now because
[00:32:32] we have the ability as consumers to find properties on our own we really don't need a REALTOR for that
[00:32:38] it's a good REALTOR's are worth their weight and gold but it's for I think it's for a lot of
[00:32:43] stuff like what you're talking about I think it's really like hey could you help me figure out
[00:32:47] where I should live like that's the really that's value anyone can search Zillow and find a property
[00:32:53] so I love the fact that you do that I'm sort of stepping on this point a little bit because I want
[00:32:58] our agents to know like this is the way you should think about it is what are the needs that my clients
[00:33:03] have what is something that maybe is a decision that they're going to have to make that's a challenging
[00:33:08] one how can I make it easier for them before they even know that they want to use me because before
[00:33:13] you buy a home you got to figure out what area you're at so you're actually doing a step before
[00:33:18] they're even thinking necessarily about calling a REALTOR so I really want to give you kudos to
[00:33:23] that because that is really an impressive an impressive thing let's talk about when the market
[00:33:31] is slower so right now the market is slower interest rates are higher than anyone would like
[00:33:36] inventory is down what are you doing to stay busy because and also by the way majority of your
[00:33:43] friends probably aren't moving out to the sub or I don't know a majority of your city friends
[00:33:48] are probably still in the city and maybe they're renting maybe they're buying but I imagine
[00:33:52] it you know not a lot of 29 year olds are probably purchasing right now so you know
[00:33:56] your peers so what are you doing to sort of stay active stay busy in a down market
[00:34:02] sure and one thing I do want to clarify is that I even though I live in the western suburbs now
[00:34:09] I'm still working on my city business too I'm sure that might change over time but I think
[00:34:15] especially with having app properties be all over the city I've got access to you know the river
[00:34:21] north office and the western springs one yes so I'm still you know keeping somewhat busy with that
[00:34:27] but it is a down market things are slower and I think it's easy for agents to immediately freak out
[00:34:36] and my brain has gone to those places too but I really have tried to think of it as an opportunity
[00:34:43] of you know this is the gift of time that I don't have in the spring market when I'm running around
[00:34:49] with the like a chicken with their head cut off no time to breathe and all those projects that I
[00:34:56] wanted to do I now have the time to so an easy one for this time of year is you know if you're not
[00:35:02] sending out a holiday card you absolutely have the time you know whether it's handwritten or it's
[00:35:09] a cool you know personalized postcard I'd say spending the time and truly writing a nice note to
[00:35:16] your clients your vendor partners friends family etc so that's something I'm working on
[00:35:23] these next couple of weeks but on top of that I think just keeping up with my CRM and I live
[00:35:32] and breathe by that so that is my reminder system for reaching out to everybody from past clients
[00:35:39] and just checking in and seeing how people are doing inviting people to go get coffee and lunches
[00:35:45] again it's the stuff that I didn't have the time for that I am doing now in addition to just
[00:35:51] really fine-tuning that business plan for next year yeah let's go in a broker tour is too you know
[00:35:58] yes broker open this is the time to do it yeah agree and the reason why people should go to broker
[00:36:05] opens there's a lot of reasons one is to learn inventory in the area but also to build relationships
[00:36:11] you know we are we are human apes and we we like connection we're interpersonally wired
[00:36:18] so we're wired for for connection we're wired for also familiarity so if you are going to broker
[00:36:25] opens if you're participating in the industry if you're making friends if you're going to events
[00:36:30] and you know doing association stuff you are just going to meet a lot of other agents and guess what
[00:36:36] happens when they receive an offer for one of their listings from your buyer and they see your name
[00:36:42] they're like oh I know Kelly Kelly's awesome does that influence maybe their decision well in a
[00:36:47] perfect world it wouldn't but does it of course it does of course it does so you want to make as many
[00:36:54] relationships as you can with other REALTORS obviously you want to play nice in the sandbox it
[00:36:59] is a cooperative commission but let's remember that these are little little ways that you can give
[00:37:05] yourself a slight psychological advantage you want when somebody sees your offer coming through you
[00:37:10] want them to be like oh my god I love Kelly I'm so glad or buyer wants to buy this right that's
[00:37:14] that's the reaction you want from the listing agent and I think you know not enough is really
[00:37:19] set about that and yes obviously the listing agent wants to do the very best for their seller
[00:37:25] but it definitely doesn't hurt to see a familiar face from that buyer's agent so guys really great
[00:37:32] suggestion there go to the broker opens go to the open houses go to the events make friends it
[00:37:38] might just help you win a deal that you don't know in the that you don't know is going to happen
[00:37:43] in the future especially if maybe you come in at the exact same price and conditions as some other agent
[00:37:48] they go well I don't know the other agent I know Kelly right so that might be just what ex ends
[00:37:53] up winning you the deal so really great suggestion really great suggestion there I also wanted to you
[00:38:01] had mentioned you're you're you do newsletters and you do um some time oh I want to talk about your CRM
[00:38:07] so I know what I I wanted to ask I want to drill down just a little bit because pretty much
[00:38:12] every brokerage has you know at least the you know most brokerages offer a CRM or you can go out
[00:38:17] and purchase one on your own what is your how does your CRM tell you what to do in other words
[00:38:23] do you have it set up so that every one of your prospects or clients gets a certain
[00:38:28] you get a reminder to call them on a certain day or email tax like how does that work for you
[00:38:34] yeah so I and I've worked with a few different CRMs over the years paid for one you know had one
[00:38:41] e and v and now I've got one at app properties and I think the what makes the most sense to me is
[00:38:48] you know first you categorize your different groups of people into maybe you know your abnc
[00:38:55] um and so those a's are I'm getting a reminder at least monthly to reach out to them um if it's
[00:39:03] you know a new open house lead or new buyer referral etc as they are getting much more frequent
[00:39:10] reminders like that's at least you know a couple of times a week during that first um you know
[00:39:16] first month or so after the introduction um but then I've got you know my b and c's who
[00:39:22] maybe will work with maybe not um everybody is on my newsletter so everybody will get that monthly
[00:39:28] but those you know b and c's they're getting I'm getting reminders quarterly to reach out to them
[00:39:33] so I think sending the time and it does take some time to organize your CRM in that way I think
[00:39:40] has saved me so much time nowadays because I'm not going through everyone individually and saying
[00:39:46] I don't really need to reach out to that person um this system just does it for me so it's helped me
[00:39:51] prioritize the big ones yeah yeah so you categorize you you you you put each one into a particular group
[00:39:58] abc etc and then you have a particular number of touches that you wish to do over the course of
[00:40:05] a certain period of time a year whatever and so every day you wake up and you have a list of
[00:40:10] to-dos that's kind of automatically generated for you to keep you on track is that my understanding?
[00:40:16] yes and yeah so I don't have it like sending out emails for me I don't uh I don't like the
[00:40:24] automated stuff but so it's just I I can decide that if I want to text the person or call them
[00:40:30] depending on the relationships or if I saw something on their social media recently that I want
[00:40:34] to congratulate them on um but it's just a reminder to have some kind of touch point yeah do something
[00:40:40] with so and so and whether it's coming on a social media post pick up the phone and call them write
[00:40:45] them a note text them whatever it is almost doesn't matter just that you're doing something that
[00:40:51] lets them know that you're thinking about them in some way and you know as simple as this is I think
[00:40:56] the vast majority of agents don't set up their systems this way where you don't really want to wake
[00:41:03] up every morning go what should I do today that that's just too much to candle it's too much to
[00:41:07] try to figure out as a REALTOR it's you got too many responsibilities there's too many just
[00:41:11] options what you really want is somebody to hand you you know virtually a little thing that says
[00:41:16] these are the 10 people you have to reach out to today and then you go okay I just have to do that
[00:41:21] and it just chunking your your life into that's what a CRM for me is just can make life a lot easier
[00:41:27] for it just says all you got to do today is deal with these these 10 15 things and then you never
[00:41:33] have to worry about losing touch with somebody you don't have to go oh when's the last time I called
[00:41:36] so and so because you all and let you know unless you fell behind in your CRM tasks you will know
[00:41:41] exactly when the last time you chatted with that person and how that worked and again this is all
[00:41:46] kind of like customer service slash marketing 101 but it is also something that's easy to forget to do
[00:41:54] it's you know I call these like the pushups of real estate it's like it's really hard it's hard
[00:41:58] to do it but it's a really good idea and it's super simple right so it's super simple to pick up
[00:42:03] the phone and go hey I was thinking about you how you doing I am on a couple of REALTOR friends of
[00:42:07] my a couple of I must be on a few of their CRMs I get a call from a friend every single month he
[00:42:14] calls me and it's the sweetest and I'm not I'm never going to be a client of his I'm a REALTOR as
[00:42:19] well he calls me once a month and goes we're not uh I won't mention his name but we we don't go out
[00:42:24] socially I mean we we have before but we're not that close every single month he calls me and he's
[00:42:30] like I was just thinking about you and I'm sure it showed up on a CRM it's a call DJ today but you
[00:42:34] know what it makes me feel special it really is a nice thing and he's a sweetheart for doing it
[00:42:40] because I'm never going to be his client but he's he's he's still putting me through that system and
[00:42:45] boy I got the call last night from him and I was like God I love that you do this even though
[00:42:51] it's not going to benefit you directly in your business you're just a good dude for doing it and
[00:42:55] I'll tell you people people know that stuff so if you can just be somebody who's you know a lot of
[00:43:01] a lot of my people service professionals in my life don't contact me outside of business stuff and
[00:43:07] I you know I think it's a great idea if you don't have a CRM as Kelly said that was the time to sort
[00:43:12] of put that together you're not as busy right now now is the time um Kelly what other suggestions
[00:43:17] would you have for somebody who's in their 20s who got or 30s or it doesn't matter the age
[00:43:23] doesn't matter newer to the business and going oh my gosh this is such a hard market like what
[00:43:28] do you would you recommend if you had to start all over today and you knowing what you know now
[00:43:33] what might you suggest open houses we talked about organizing your your sphere of influence
[00:43:39] are you putting everybody you know in in your in your database is it like hey even the dry cleaner
[00:43:47] who knows my name am I putting those people in like how how detailed do you get with yours?
[00:43:52] I I probably should be better at adding everybody under the sun um I I know I know everybody in
[00:44:00] it so I you know have scrubbed it at one point and I didn't know you know a number of emails
[00:44:04] that's like you know what that's just taking up room um and space so I'd say I know of at least
[00:44:12] every person in there um but I probably should get better at just adding in because it's so easy
[00:44:17] to add somebody to a newsletter trip campaign if they unsubscribe they unsubscribe and that's okay
[00:44:23] but you never know they might read something that resonates with them and that's you know happen
[00:44:28] a few times where I've not even known that person was subscribed and they replied you know I love
[00:44:33] your newsletter blah blah I have a question for you so um I think leaving those opportunities um
[00:44:39] open is a good reason to have them in your CRM for sure it if you didn't have a big sphere of
[00:44:46] influence and your newer REALTOR how might you expand that how might you start to add people to your
[00:44:52] database if you were what would you suggest to a new age of yeah I mean I'd say obviously open houses
[00:44:59] kind of keep going back to that but I mean you've got to be diligent and after that you might get
[00:45:05] a list of names and sit down and organize them nicely into your CRM that's a great way for me to build
[00:45:11] my um CRM over time sorry I hope you can't hear my dog in the background right now
[00:45:18] and um but also getting involved in various organizations um so maybe join an intramural league
[00:45:27] or you know whatever it is getting involved in your condos one of their committees and I think
[00:45:33] it's a great way you know you're getting to know these people so you're not like spamming and
[00:45:37] stealing their email addresses um but opportunities where you are getting to meet a lot of new people
[00:45:46] and there's a way to you know contact them you have their information I see no problem with adding
[00:45:52] them and that's a good way to build your CRM as well yeah I always I always love it Brian Biffini had
[00:45:58] said that he goes if you really want to be successful as an agent and your newer he goes meet two to
[00:46:02] five people every single day which is not an easy task but if you can meet two to five people a day
[00:46:07] be like oh by the way I'm a REALTOR oh you know what if you give me your email I'll I'll stay in
[00:46:12] touch with you or something um if that's all you did and you just met two people a day and you did
[00:46:17] that let's just say 200 days out of the year so that's adding 400 people to your database um
[00:46:24] within a couple of years you're going to be flush with business
[00:46:28] absolutely and yeah and for those that are building and it's a smaller pool like really cultivate
[00:46:34] that and make those people feel you know important and connected and taking you know good care of
[00:46:43] that small group of people though naturally want to you know introduce you to their friends
[00:46:48] and family so I think it kind of goes back to adding value to the consumer um yeah
[00:46:58] have have you run into ever any issues where you know and again you're you're a younger person
[00:47:03] you have a youthful look as well so curious if that's ever been a challenge for you as you've
[00:47:11] been growing your business is it's like oh you look so young you know maybe too young to be a REALTOR
[00:47:16] I'm not suggesting you look so young too young to be a REALTOR but has that ever come up and is
[00:47:20] that ever a hurdle that you've had to had to work with oh I I get that all the time still I'm sure when
[00:47:26] I'm a little bit older I will appreciate it but it is a challenge when you're a younger agent
[00:47:31] and you are competing against very established brokers who've been doing this for 20 plus years
[00:47:37] um so I'd say the first thing is being willing to learn um so if you don't have that listing yet
[00:47:46] like offers help and learn every aspect of the listing process and the buying process and once you have
[00:47:53] um
[00:47:55] the data that you can try to experience I think that is what speaks for itself um you know obviously
[00:48:03] doing the research if you are up for a listing and um really you know getting into the data
[00:48:10] and really proving yourself that way I think that can be helpful but I think experience is
[00:48:15] a big part of it and it's hard to get that experience when you are young um so I really think
[00:48:20] the best way is just offering to help even if it's you're getting paid you know $25 to cover
[00:48:26] a showing or $50 for an inspection or whatever it is um it'll just make you more confident
[00:48:32] when you are in the moment with a client um but it can also I think um help to demonstrate you know
[00:48:40] your value and and your experience yeah I couldn't agree more just do as much as you can do as much
[00:48:48] activities you can don't worry about getting paid as much as get experience really a great great
[00:48:54] place to wrap up I also want to remind all of our listeners if you have clients or you have
[00:49:01] friends that live in the city of Chicago or the suburbs but specifically if they're in the city
[00:49:07] and thinking about making that move to the suburbs but maybe you don't work uh the suburbs or maybe
[00:49:12] you're not an agent in Chicago maybe you're an agent somewhere else but you're one of our listeners
[00:49:16] Kelly it would be a great resource for those clients um I again I just love the idea that she takes
[00:49:22] people on tours to help them figure out what suburb is the best fit you get a such a cool thing so
[00:49:27] if you have clients that you don't uh maybe have that experience in anyone refer to Kelly or you

And now let's just get right to it. So my conversation with superstar Kelly Carlson. Hey, today on the show, our guest is Kelly Carlson with Kelly Carlson homes at properties, Christie's International real estate here in Chicago. Let's tell you more about Kelly. Now Kelly Carlson is an award winning broker with at properties in Christie's International real estate in their Western Springs office. That's a suburb of Chicago. Now after launching her real estate career in the city in 2020, after four plus years in consulting, Kelly was named Engle and Volcker Chicago rookie of the year. And more recently recognized as a member. And this is such a big deal of the National Association of REALTORS 30 under 30 class of 2023 just to let people know what that is every year. The National Association of REALTORS wants to find the agents who are in their 20s who are doing really exceptional things in the industry and having exceptional success as well and highlighting them. And she was one of the award winners this year with a love of interior design, historical homes and do it yourself updates. This career is the perfect blend of her passions and professional background. And she's no longer doing the consultants Monday to Thursday fly out and then back on the weekends so she gets to stay here in Chicago more often. Please visit Kelly at her website, which is Kelly Carlson homes dot com and follow her on Instagram. Kelly Carlson homes Facebook as well. We will have links to both all of her social media in our show notes. Kelly, welcome to the show. Thank you so much for having me DJ. This is such a pinch me moment when I was in the process of getting my license. I was bingeing all of your old episodes in 2020. So very cool, full circle moment to be here. Well it is an honor to have one of our listeners on the show and yeah, excited to chat. It's always fun when when people find us or we find people and I'm just so grateful that you're here and you have done some really exceptional things. I am also curious. So I know you're a university of Illinois grad. Did you go straight into consulting right out of school? Was that kind of your path? Yes, and it was kind of one of those you get recruited in the fall of your senior year and then started in October after graduating. So had a nice long summer vacation and then it was really time to get to work. And did you have that consultants life where you were traveling to clients during the week coming back on the weekends? Was that kind of how you started? I was not every Monday through Thursday, but my particular consulting group did have a lot of special projects. So it took me to a lot of remote locations across the US. So I had great airline status at that point and that is probably the one thing I missed. Yeah, no more instant first class upgrades. My sister lost that as well. She's now with a startup prior to that. She wasn't a consultant, but she used to travel for different jobs and now she's lost all of that. And she still occasionally gets it upgrade, but it is we laugh and go, oh great, you're just like the rest of us now, which we love. So why the switch from consulting to very few people, I think get out of consulting because it is such a really it's a wonderful career and track. It really truly is. It's not of course the travel stinks, but ultimately a lot of people stay in it. So I'm curious what was so why did you get out and why real estate? Sure. Well, this story kind of goes back to I want to say high school college because I had always had a love for architecture homes. I took every CAD class in my high school went to a pre architecture camp at U of I. And ultimately when I was kind of in that phase of applying to schools, it was still end of recession. Residential architecture was not necessarily the place to find a job at the time. So I thought, well, I like math and science. I'll do civil engineering, which is a complimentary field to architecture. And so did that at U of I great kind of versatile degree. I knew I didn't want to do traditional design engineering. And so I started looking into consulting, which is a route that a lot of engineering graduates go into. So that seemed to be a nice mix of getting to work with people, client services, but also relevance, my degree. And so yeah, I did that for four years, starting at a big for firm and then moved on to a smaller boutique management consulting firm. I could not think of a better place to watch my career. It really taught me the value of exceptional client service and how to be professional, how to manage a very demanding schedule and still meet deadlines. But I got to a point where I, you know, I'd been at two firms. I didn't see myself in it for the long haul and didn't think that going to another company was going to, you know, solve what I felt like was missing. And so it kind of brought me back to that place of, you know, I've always loved real estate architecture that has just always fascinated me. And the voice in my head previously had always been but you went to school for engineering and you're a consultant. And this is what you do. But I started to think about it differently in terms of how could I leverage this experience in the corporate world to differentiate myself as somebody, you know, I didn't have a sales background, but I had a lot of transferable skills for a totally services business. And so I did it. I quit my job in October of 2020, got my license and got hit the ground running in January of 2021. Right, right smack dab in the middle of the pandemic. Yeah, perfect timing. That is incredible. And then for you to have enough success to catch the eye of the National Association of REALTORS for their 30 under 30 is quite a big deal. I know many, many people, friends of mine who have not made that list and have tried many times. A lot of my friends have made the list as well. But boy, it's a big feather in your cap. So congratulations. I'm excited to learn more about maybe what they they see in you as well. And I think civil engineering too is a really nice transferable skill. And I know again, that wasn't really your career, but it was your your field of study and interest because civil engineers, you know, people don't really know what that is. Just one one one thing that civil engineers do is they they're really good at visualizing. So they can see like two points of land and they can visualize a bridge across or like if there's a river in between or something they can they can visualize things that aren't there and then they can bring those things to life. So I imagine even just that skill along with your architecture knowledge and love of of of homes and interior design probably is pretty helpful when you're maybe walking a client through a home saying I you can probably see things that maybe I wouldn't be able to see for example, I'm just curious if that ever comes up where or maybe it's a renovation you're able to maybe visualize that more effectively than you know, somebody without those skills. Yes, that has definitely been helpful on the renovation front. The home that we're sitting in I'm sitting in right now is actually the home that my husband and I just bought and did not look like this a few months ago and there was a lot of work to get into this place. And so something I was able to do for myself, but then also for my clients who are maybe struggling in the current low inventory market not able to find that move in ready home or they've got to kind of grow into it knowing what is in place and what can be done over time. Yeah, it's funny if you're watching this you'll see you're probably listening so you won't see this but Kelly has an all white kitchen. I also although you won't see this on mine because I'm at the office, but I have an all white kitchen and we were talking to her laughing about that earlier and I just I have all white everything white walls white, you know, I'm like really all white white and black and I'm thinking like in it'll be funny in like 10 years when people are like why were people doing all white like what you know like it's cool now but it won't be cool forever so it is kind of funny how how styles evolve and change over time. But let's talk about how you built your business because yes, I think the consulting background every consultant I know in the big four, you know professionalism hard work meeting deadlines and just being of service. You talked about customer service or really sort of the main pillars and being a good listener I think consultants are great listeners as well, but they you know those those are really important skills that obviously transfer over in real estate, but you still had to build your business. People see you as a saw you as a consultant that was your your profession and a very well respected profession and then you know that that was your path and then all of a sudden you're pivoting was it challenging to you know introduce your sphere of influence to your new career or was like what was that process like? Sure so as you know after I got licensed I started interviewing at different brokerages and met Jennifer Ames who is a top-led-easing Chicago agent also the licensed partner of angle and vulgar Chicago in Lincoln Park and her and I connected and she had had a previous career prior to real estate as well and so once I did get my license I was so excited to come over to her company and you know unlike a lot of new agents they start out on a team and they learn from that team member and they help out and it's a great way to get experience but the unique thing about angle and vulgar at the time is their boutique firm and Jenny had told me she's you know if you come over you can be a solo agent and we will help you we will give you those tools and so that was something that you know I was so grateful for her mentorship and being able to get started as a solo agent but under you know having the experience of getting to cover open houses and that was a huge part of building my business outside of you know making sure and this is a big thing that I have been taught is don't be a secret agent like make sure that your fear of influence knows you know that you are in real estate and this is a full-time serious career for you so I think I took advantage of you know social media and a newsletter and just connecting with people I now had more time to be able to call up friends and people I knew from college to go grab coffee because I wasn't traveling and so it was kind of a mix of just offering out all of my weekends to do open houses for any agents in our office and then working with you know friends and friends of friends over time you know I say that first year was a lot more friends and family open house buyers and then over time it kind of I think you know I had done a good job with those friends that they felt comfortable referring me to their friends and family so over time it's become more referral based but I'd say you know if you're a new agent like don't be afraid to let your people know that this is your career and let it you know you talked about open houses I feel like agents don't do newer agents may not know depending on what firm they're at or who their circle is that they know of other agents but if you work in an office where there are agents with listings and I you know not there are small firms with just a couple of brokers so this might not apply to everyone but if there is someone in your office with at least one listing I would go and ask beg plead and and do anything you can to get in their good graces if you're a brand new agent to sit in open house can you tell us that's my suggestion what would you recommend do you do you agree or you know what has your experience with open houses 100% I my actual my first buyer client was from the first open house that I held and that's not how it goes every time you know there are going to be times where you sit in an empty condo for two hours and you know scroll your phone or check emails but other times you might connect really well with somebody and I'd say just you know asking questions trying to get to know a person see what information you can learn about them because then when you are following up you aren't going to be like that 12th agent who is sending them the same email saying do you want to buy this kind of or do you work with me on something else I think trying to create some kind of personal connection is can can make a difference and that was the case with my first buyer client they were so impressed by how much I remembered from our five minute conversation so it goes back to that listening I think yeah I think you're right and something to consider it so the first step of course is getting getting an open house when you don't have a listing which you know beg the people in your firm to help you do that and then when you have people walking through the open house Kelly what I heard from you is pay very very close attention to what they tell you and maybe even take notes after they leave because and I was thinking about this as you were saying I was like why would you be the eighth person that maybe another real eight other REALTORS might be and I go oh because they're going to other open houses like it just occurred to me oh yeah of course they are and so of course they're going to get eight follow-up messages from thanks for coming to my open house and if you can add in you know whatever the conversation was yeah all of a sudden now you're you stand above everyone else definitely but it's a win-win for the listing agents too because yeah like you said they've got maybe multiple listings and they can't be in two places at once so it's not as a staff it doesn't hurt to ask and also in many cases it really makes the seller look good to the or sorry makes the selling agent look good to the seller or the listing agent I should say because I technically the selling agent is the one who buys them anyway I don't know why they we do it that way it's too confusing I know I'm sorry I'm sorry but anyway I don't make the rules so sorry for the confusion there but yeah for for anyone for anyone who you know it is a listing agent you know we know that oftentimes by asking a listing agent hey can I sit in open house for your property they get to then say to the seller hey we're gonna do an open house and of course that just makes the seller think that the listing agent's doing stuff and that's a good thing too so it really is a win-win for everybody obviously for the agent sitting the open house if nobody shows up and you know that is always a bummer but it happens but the important thing is these are where people do come into open houses and I know that you know we live in so much of a virtual world now but I encourage everyone if you're if you're if you're not slammed with appointments these days I would be asking every listing agent I know in my office can I please please please come sit in open house and okay cool so so let's talk I want to talk about social media because I'm 47 and I used to be I used to feel like I was a young guy I'm not a young guy anymore but I would you know social media is just kind of a different animal for people who are in your case you're like about 20 years younger tell us a little bit about how you've built your business on social I'm just curious on what's worked for you how do you think about content you know what how are you in the you know how are you posting tell us about that sure you know initially I had thought you know you have to be on every single platform and just you know reach everybody from every direction and I started to learn that I think age is a big part of figuring out what you're where your demographic is and for me at 29 I'd save most of my year and people my age are still on Instagram Facebook not so much TikTok I don't have I probably should but I just I'm afraid I get too addicted but that's been kind of the biggest social media piece for me I haven't business account but I like to mix in still some personal with that I you will probably never see me post a just listed or just sold post well no hold on what why is that why do you not post those because you know I my kind of thought process as I'm deciding you know to put together some form of content my question is is this that value to the consumer and when I saw those and when I see them you know it's kind of just it doesn't do much for me however if I see you know a picture of a couple in front of a house and there's a story behind it I'm interested and it gives me more of the taste of you know who that agent is and how they work and so I love you know on occasion to share client stories in that way and yes sure it's showing that you are you know selling homes and you know you're successful and all that but it's not so in your face so I think it goes back to the is it something that is adding value as we are fixing up a 1920s tutor I have been sharing some of our renovation journey because I personally love seeing before and after I think that content people generally enjoy and what it's kind of evolved into is going back to kind of helping people see what they can do with the space and also you know doing things depending on what your budget is you know here's places to splurge here's places to save so I found that to be kind of complimentary with you know posting normal real estate stuff too but I don't have a great you know like calendar anything of what I do I just when I have the time I you know come up with an idea and and post away I think that's really really great advice I'm not a fan of the just listed just sold stuff either I think it's perfectly okay to do it doesn't do much for me it doesn't necessarily turn me off when I see it but it doesn't light me up either like when I see somebody do it I in this I'm sort of not a good example because I see all my friends having success and I'm very excited to see them when they get their just listed just sold but if I was just a consumer not in this industry I'd be like yeah I don't I mean it's it'd be like the equivalent of you know somebody saying I just got us you know I just got this big sale at the company I work at and I close this big deal it's like we don't do that really we might tell our friends and family it close this big deal but we don't necessarily broadcast it but REALTORS do broadcast it and that's fine I'm not saying you shouldn't but it shouldn't I don't think it should be the primary I don't think anyone would say that should be the primary driver for what your content is I think people you're right are more interested in the story they're more interested in learning about you and kind of what you're into and also if you want to see really cool DIY before and after I encourage everybody go to Reddit and subscribe to the DIY subreddit it is awesome and there's like I think there's millions of people subscribe to it and you get to see all sorts of projects in there and there's the reason why millions of people are in there not everyone's a DIYer that's in there but they just love lurking and seeing so if you are somebody who does projects check out the DIY subreddit whether it's a home renovation or just something outside of real estate you could document a lot of that stuff put it in social and it just shows people that you have passion and interest and that you're kind of doing cool stuff so I am a big big believer in that as well so that's interesting so you're you're an Instagrammer more than anything TikTok's not your thing I stay away from TikTok I post our videos there but I don't browse TikTok for the exact reason you mentioned is I'm way to I have a way too much of an addictive personality and I would get lost in it in hours would go away so but whatever social media platform that that you know I think somebody is on is probably the one the one that they like the most is probably the one where where they should spend the most time but let's let's talk about so so you have this great apprenticeship sort of you know mentorship with one of the top producers here in Chicago and then you had to make a transition because you and your husband just bought this place out in the western suburbs you are not all that close to the city as you used to be used to be right in the city and what was that a bit of a transition as well for your business was it was the majority of your business in the city prior and how is that shifted as you've moved out west sure you know it's interesting because at my age late 20s a lot of my clients I think COVID kind of fed this up we're moving out of the city maybe earlier than they had would have been in the past and so I having grown up in the western suburbs cleared in hills I already had a pretty good knowledge of many of the western suburbs so I was able to help several buyers and some sellers out that way so for a good portion of my time in the city I was splitting my time a bit between western suburbs and the city so I'd say the transition wasn't it hasn't felt you crazy but I am now in a very you know hyper local market where most of the agents who do the business here live in town and part of that I started to learn very quickly is how many of the deals are happening off-market they don't even hit the private market they are happening you know just because there's word of mouth in town and so it kind of got me thinking that I would want to find a more local brokerage I had such an amazing experience that angle brokers and have nothing but amazing things to say about Jenny and the whole team but I quickly realized that you know being kind of the new girl in town and being with a brokerage that had a very strong local presence would be an important piece for establishing myself here long-term so I'm still trying to figure it out it's still somewhat new but I've got a really great business plan for 2024 and Trisha Roberto is the managing broker for App Properties, Hensdale and Western Spring and she's been so wonderful at getting me ready for this next year so yeah let's talk about this next year so what's on the marketing plan I am always interested on you know and again I know you talked about with social media you don't necessarily have a training calendar or sorry a content calendar but I'm curious on what kind of marketing efforts you plan to do to find additional buyers and sellers in 2024. Absolutely so my kind of big marketing campaign for 2024 I'm calling it going west buying your first home in Western suburbs so you know there's a lot of you know Chicago residents they're homeowner maybe they own their condo or they're renting they're ready for that move to the suburbs but they don't they're maybe not from the area and so they don't have that knowledge of you know if schools are important where you know how to navigate that commuting to downtown if they're still going to work in the city how to make that as easy as a transition as possible what you know what are the things they like to do in the city that they can still find some version of out this way and so so my focus is going to be helping with those first time suburban buyers and that'll be you know through kind of educational content on Instagram featuring different suburbs, local businesses etc but then also something I've started implementing is suburbs tours where I will take a client out privately for a couple of hours and both tour maybe you know five or six suburbs will drive around I will share you know kind of my take on how that local market is things that are notable about that town and I think it's a great way to get to know somebody before you start looking at homes but it's also I think a better way to get somebody out in your versus maybe trying to drag them to a happy hour at you know of downtown bar and western springs so that's that's a big part of me and in addition to kind of my typical you know newsletter you know I'd like to do quarterly client event at boutique fitness studios or maybe a fun local happy hour spot things like that. You just said something that really really sort of peaked my interest because I was trying to think as you were saying it I was like we've done over 500 episodes as anyone ever said this before and I don't think anyone has so I want to go back to something that you mentioned about these tours I think this is a brilliant idea and I we did not I did not know you were going to talk about this so I'm so excited because now I just got a click on my thoughts because here's what I was thinking I've never heard of anybody doing this so so typically you know you work with a REALTOR when you're ready to buy you already know approximately where you know the city you know maybe even the subdivision if you're out in the suburbs or the neighborhood if you're in the city whatever you have a general idea and we all hate when we get those buyers who call in and they go I'm open to anything and you're like oh now we got to figure this out but what I love about what you're doing is you're helping people make a decision of where they want to live not the home itself which you'll do a step two step one is probably the most challenging of the steps is where should we live and people normally go on that journey themselves they do not usually have a guide with them yeah maybe they're watching YouTube videos learning about different suburbs but they're not necessarily even being driven around to different suburbs going well here's some cool things about this one and here's some you know maybe not so cool things and here's this suburb and I mean that in Chicago we have I don't know how many suburbs like probably more than 50 altogether or villages and suburbs so it can be really I've lived here 21 years and I still don't really understand the suburbs and so that so that would be incredibly helpful for me if I was going to move out in the suburbs and I'm in this industry and I don't know I don't know you know anything about the suburbs and so that is such an important thing is really what here's what I heard you do you thought about what the need is what is the need well people who live in the city a lot of them move out to the suburbs because they want to start a family get more space whatever lots of reasons people typically move from urban to rural and so great so she Kelly knows this happens that's where you grew up as well and she thought well what's one of the challenges of that well picking a picking a place picking an area to live to move in and there's so many different options so I'm going to do these tours I am so impressed with that because that is an incredible service to provide and absolutely I would be I would be thrilled if I was living in Chicago and I was like well I got to move out to the suburbs I need more space and then I have to go on I got to figure out I got to look at all these suburbs I got as a huge thing and so for you to take somebody around or take a group of people around for a few hours amazing I can't imagine is I've never heard of anyone else doing that I'm sure other people do but it's got to be is that like a unique thing that you came up with yeah I was you know I was really struggling to brainstorm you know how do I get that type of person you know they're not going to take the train out here to come to an event of mine but I think I think like you said just kind of what is that need and how can I fill that and sure you are spending upfront kind of a lot of time upfront with a person but you know I think when you invest in somebody like that they're more likely to want to invest in you and it also I think can save some time on the back end because you aren't spending your wheel touring 10 different areas because they have no idea what they want yeah and if you even if you video some of it and not necessarily videoing the client you're taking out but if you take some quick little shots you can then put those together and create clips of like hey we we did a tour today we toured these four suburbs we showed you know we showed them the downtowns and the schools at whatever and you could actually make that into content as well and I would think you know that's a tremendous value that an agent can provide is you know this idea of being the gateway to the actual house I think is dev valued a little bit right now because we have the ability as consumers to find properties on our own we really don't need a REALTOR for that it's a good REALTOR's are worth their weight and gold but it's for I think it's for a lot of stuff like what you're talking about I think it's really like hey could you help me figure out where I should live like that's the really that's value anyone can search Zillow and find a property so I love the fact that you do that I'm sort of stepping on this point a little bit because I want our agents to know like this is the way you should think about it is what are the needs that my clients have what is something that maybe is a decision that they're going to have to make that's a challenging one how can I make it easier for them before they even know that they want to use me because before you buy a home you got to figure out what area you're at so you're actually doing a step before they're even thinking necessarily about calling a REALTOR so I really want to give you kudos to that because that is really an impressive an impressive thing let's talk about when the market is slower so right now the market is slower interest rates are higher than anyone would like inventory is down what are you doing to stay busy because and also by the way majority of your friends probably aren't moving out to the sub or I don't know a majority of your city friends are probably still in the city and maybe they're renting maybe they're buying but I imagine it you know not a lot of 29 year olds are probably purchasing right now so you know your peers so what are you doing to sort of stay active stay busy in a down market sure and one thing I do want to clarify is that I even though I live in the western suburbs now I'm still working on my city business too I'm sure that might change over time but I think especially with having app properties be all over the city I've got access to you know the river north office and the western springs one yes so I'm still you know keeping somewhat busy with that but it is a down market things are slower and I think it's easy for agents to immediately freak out and my brain has gone to those places too but I really have tried to think of it as an opportunity of you know this is the gift of time that I don't have in the spring market when I'm running around with the like a chicken with their head cut off no time to breathe and all those projects that I wanted to do I now have the time to so an easy one for this time of year is you know if you're not sending out a holiday card you absolutely have the time you know whether it's handwritten or it's a cool you know personalized postcard I'd say spending the time and truly writing a nice note to your clients your vendor partners friends family etc so that's something I'm working on these next couple of weeks but on top of that I think just keeping up with my CRM and I live and breathe by that so that is my reminder system for reaching out to everybody from past clients and just checking in and seeing how people are doing inviting people to go get coffee and lunches again it's the stuff that I didn't have the time for that I am doing now in addition to just really fine-tuning that business plan for next year yeah let's go in a broker tour is too you know yes broker open this is the time to do it yeah agree and the reason why people should go to broker opens there's a lot of reasons one is to learn inventory in the area but also to build relationships you know we are we are human apes and we we like connection we're interpersonally wired so we're wired for for connection we're wired for also familiarity so if you are going to broker opens if you're participating in the industry if you're making friends if you're going to events and you know doing association stuff you are just going to meet a lot of other agents and guess what happens when they receive an offer for one of their listings from your buyer and they see your name they're like oh I know Kelly Kelly's awesome does that influence maybe their decision well in a perfect world it wouldn't but does it of course it does of course it does so you want to make as many relationships as you can with other REALTORS obviously you want to play nice in the sandbox it is a cooperative commission but let's remember that these are little little ways that you can give yourself a slight psychological advantage you want when somebody sees your offer coming through you want them to be like oh my god I love Kelly I'm so glad or buyer wants to buy this right that's that's the reaction you want from the listing agent and I think you know not enough is really set about that and yes obviously the listing agent wants to do the very best for their seller but it definitely doesn't hurt to see a familiar face from that buyer's agent so guys really great suggestion there go to the broker opens go to the open houses go to the events make friends it might just help you win a deal that you don't know in the that you don't know is going to happen in the future especially if maybe you come in at the exact same price and conditions as some other agent they go well I don't know the other agent I know Kelly right so that might be just what ex ends up winning you the deal so really great suggestion really great suggestion there I also wanted to you had mentioned you're you're you do newsletters and you do um some time oh I want to talk about your CRM so I know what I I wanted to ask I want to drill down just a little bit because pretty much every brokerage has you know at least the you know most brokerages offer a CRM or you can go out and purchase one on your own what is your how does your CRM tell you what to do in other words do you have it set up so that every one of your prospects or clients gets a certain you get a reminder to call them on a certain day or email tax like how does that work for you yeah so I and I've worked with a few different CRMs over the years paid for one you know had one e and v and now I've got one at app properties and I think the what makes the most sense to me is you know first you categorize your different groups of people into maybe you know your abnc um and so those a's are I'm getting a reminder at least monthly to reach out to them um if it's you know a new open house lead or new buyer referral etc as they are getting much more frequent reminders like that's at least you know a couple of times a week during that first um you know first month or so after the introduction um but then I've got you know my b and c's who maybe will work with maybe not um everybody is on my newsletter so everybody will get that monthly but those you know b and c's they're getting I'm getting reminders quarterly to reach out to them so I think sending the time and it does take some time to organize your CRM in that way I think has saved me so much time nowadays because I'm not going through everyone individually and saying I don't really need to reach out to that person um this system just does it for me so it's helped me prioritize the big ones yeah yeah so you categorize you you you you put each one into a particular group abc etc and then you have a particular number of touches that you wish to do over the course of a certain period of time a year whatever and so every day you wake up and you have a list of to-dos that's kind of automatically generated for you to keep you on track is that my understanding? yes and yeah so I don't have it like sending out emails for me I don't uh I don't like the automated stuff but so it's just I I can decide that if I want to text the person or call them depending on the relationships or if I saw something on their social media recently that I want to congratulate them on um but it's just a reminder to have some kind of touch point yeah do something with so and so and whether it's coming on a social media post pick up the phone and call them write them a note text them whatever it is almost doesn't matter just that you're doing something that lets them know that you're thinking about them in some way and you know as simple as this is I think the vast majority of agents don't set up their systems this way where you don't really want to wake up every morning go what should I do today that that's just too much to candle it's too much to try to figure out as a REALTOR it's you got too many responsibilities there's too many just options what you really want is somebody to hand you you know virtually a little thing that says these are the 10 people you have to reach out to today and then you go okay I just have to do that and it just chunking your your life into that's what a CRM for me is just can make life a lot easier for it just says all you got to do today is deal with these these 10 15 things and then you never have to worry about losing touch with somebody you don't have to go oh when's the last time I called so and so because you all and let you know unless you fell behind in your CRM tasks you will know exactly when the last time you chatted with that person and how that worked and again this is all kind of like customer service slash marketing 101 but it is also something that's easy to forget to do it's you know I call these like the pushups of real estate it's like it's really hard it's hard to do it but it's a really good idea and it's super simple right so it's super simple to pick up the phone and go hey I was thinking about you how you doing I am on a couple of REALTOR friends of my a couple of I must be on a few of their CRMs I get a call from a friend every single month he calls me and it's the sweetest and I'm not I'm never going to be a client of his I'm a REALTOR as well he calls me once a month and goes we're not uh I won't mention his name but we we don't go out socially I mean we we have before but we're not that close every single month he calls me and he's like I was just thinking about you and I'm sure it showed up on a CRM it's a call DJ today but you know what it makes me feel special it really is a nice thing and he's a sweetheart for doing it because I'm never going to be his client but he's he's he's still putting me through that system and boy I got the call last night from him and I was like God I love that you do this even though it's not going to benefit you directly in your business you're just a good dude for doing it and I'll tell you people people know that stuff so if you can just be somebody who's you know a lot of a lot of my people service professionals in my life don't contact me outside of business stuff and I you know I think it's a great idea if you don't have a CRM as Kelly said that was the time to sort of put that together you're not as busy right now now is the time um Kelly what other suggestions would you have for somebody who's in their 20s who got or 30s or it doesn't matter the age doesn't matter newer to the business and going oh my gosh this is such a hard market like what do you would you recommend if you had to start all over today and you knowing what you know now what might you suggest open houses we talked about organizing your your sphere of influence are you putting everybody you know in in your in your database is it like hey even the dry cleaner who knows my name am I putting those people in like how how detailed do you get with yours? I I probably should be better at adding everybody under the sun um I I know I know everybody in it so I you know have scrubbed it at one point and I didn't know you know a number of emails that's like you know what that's just taking up room um and space so I'd say I know of at least every person in there um but I probably should get better at just adding in because it's so easy to add somebody to a newsletter trip campaign if they unsubscribe they unsubscribe and that's okay but you never know they might read something that resonates with them and that's you know happen a few times where I've not even known that person was subscribed and they replied you know I love your newsletter blah blah I have a question for you so um I think leaving those opportunities um open is a good reason to have them in your CRM for sure it if you didn't have a big sphere of influence and your newer REALTOR how might you expand that how might you start to add people to your database if you were what would you suggest to a new age of yeah I mean I'd say obviously open houses kind of keep going back to that but I mean you've got to be diligent and after that you might get a list of names and sit down and organize them nicely into your CRM that's a great way for me to build my um CRM over time sorry I hope you can't hear my dog in the background right now and um but also getting involved in various organizations um so maybe join an intramural league or you know whatever it is getting involved in your condos one of their committees and I think it's a great way you know you're getting to know these people so you're not like spamming and stealing their email addresses um but opportunities where you are getting to meet a lot of new people and there's a way to you know contact them you have their information I see no problem with adding them and that's a good way to build your CRM as well yeah I always I always love it Brian Biffini had said that he goes if you really want to be successful as an agent and your newer he goes meet two to five people every single day which is not an easy task but if you can meet two to five people a day be like oh by the way I'm a REALTOR oh you know what if you give me your email I'll I'll stay in touch with you or something um if that's all you did and you just met two people a day and you did that let's just say 200 days out of the year so that's adding 400 people to your database um within a couple of years you're going to be flush with business absolutely and yeah and for those that are building and it's a smaller pool like really cultivate that and make those people feel you know important and connected and taking you know good care of that small group of people though naturally want to you know introduce you to their friends and family so I think it kind of goes back to adding value to the consumer um yeah have have you run into ever any issues where you know and again you're you're a younger person you have a youthful look as well so curious if that's ever been a challenge for you as you've been growing your business is it's like oh you look so young you know maybe too young to be a REALTOR I'm not suggesting you look so young too young to be a REALTOR but has that ever come up and is that ever a hurdle that you've had to had to work with oh I I get that all the time still I'm sure when I'm a little bit older I will appreciate it but it is a challenge when you're a younger agent and you are competing against very established brokers who've been doing this for 20 plus years um so I'd say the first thing is being willing to learn um so if you don't have that listing yet like offers help and learn every aspect of the listing process and the buying process and once you have um the data that you can try to experience I think that is what speaks for itself um you know obviously doing the research if you are up for a listing and um really you know getting into the data and really proving yourself that way I think that can be helpful but I think experience is a big part of it and it's hard to get that experience when you are young um so I really think the best way is just offering to help even if it's you're getting paid you know $25 to cover a showing or $50 for an inspection or whatever it is um it'll just make you more confident when you are in the moment with a client um but it can also I think um help to demonstrate you know your value and and your experience yeah I couldn't agree more just do as much as you can do as much activities you can don't worry about getting paid as much as get experience really a great great place to wrap up I also want to remind all of our listeners if you have clients or you have friends that live in the city of Chicago or the suburbs but specifically if they're in the city and thinking about making that move to the suburbs but maybe you don't work uh the suburbs or maybe you're not an agent in Chicago maybe you're an agent somewhere else but you're one of our listeners Kelly it would be a great resource for those clients um I again I just love the idea that she takes people on tours to help them figure out what suburb is the best fit you get a such a cool thing so if you have clients that you don't uh maybe have that experience in anyone refer to Kelly or you have clients you know you're in a different state and they move here and they're
