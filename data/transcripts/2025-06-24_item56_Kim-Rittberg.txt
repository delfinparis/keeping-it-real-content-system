[00:00:00] Here's a problem. You have a CRM filled with prospects and yet every one of those people
[00:00:06] know that you're a REALTOR. That's good. But what happens when they know multiple people
[00:00:10] who are REALTOR's? How do they decide on who to choose and how can you let them know that
[00:00:16] you are the absolute right person for their next purchase or sale? We're going to talk about
[00:00:21] that today. Stay tuned. This episode of Keeping It Real is brought to you by Real Geeks.

[00:01:29] And now on to our show. Today's episode is brought to you by Corded.io. Are you looking
[00:01:35] for agents to join your brokerage or team? Now, as a real estate recruiter, I can tell you the
[00:01:40] answer is always yes. But most agents aren't looking to move right now. So how do you know who to
[00:01:46] contact? Well, what if I were to tell you there's a recruiting and retention tool powered by
[00:01:51] artificial intelligence that shows you exactly which agents in your local market are looking to
[00:01:56] leave their brokerage right now and which agents at your own firm are also looking to leave you?
[00:02:03] Now, I've been recruiting REALTOR's for 15 years and I've hired over 2000 agents. I can tell you
[00:02:09] with no exaggeration. This is the tool I've been waiting for. Corded's AI looks for trends across
[00:02:14] dozens of variables for each agent in your market and shows you which agents they believe are likely
[00:02:20] to move. Not only does it do that, but Corded's AI went and visited my recruiting website and read
[00:02:26] everything I offer. So now when I'm recruiting, Corded's AI tells me exactly what to say based on
[00:02:32] that agent's needs and what my brokerage can offer. It even writes emails for me. I've never seen
[00:02:38] anything like it and I use it every single day. Now, if you are looking to grow your brokerage,
[00:02:44] Corded.io is the best tool out there. Visit Corded.io to schedule a demo again. That's Corded.io.
[00:02:52] And now, onto the show.
[00:03:08] Hello, people from Real Listeners. I am Kendra Burgan. I'm excited to talk to you today about
[00:03:12] how to prove two buyers and sellers that you are worth the investment. I'll go into that what I mean
[00:03:19] by that in just a second. If you're hearing a little background noise, my kids are done with school.
[00:03:23] They're playing like knock-hack, you're a foosball or something in my apartment in New York. So
[00:03:27] that's where you're hearing the background. Today, I wanted to talk about how to show potential
[00:03:33] clients that you are worth the investment. You know, when things are uncertain and people aren't
[00:03:38] sure if they're definitely going to buy or definitely going to sell, they're going to go through a
[00:03:42] thought process. Am I going to do this? And am I going to do it with you? So I'm going to help you
[00:03:47] with a couple of content ideas and a couple of messaging ideas so you can show people you are worth it.
[00:03:53] Right? You are the person that they should be working with. So a little bit about me and who I am,
[00:03:58] I spend 20 years in media working at places like Netflix. I was a producer and writer for TV news,
[00:04:04] covering real estate, finance, lifestyle, a lot of different things. And I launched the first
[00:04:10] ever video unit for us weekly magazine. So I love helping you make your message clearer and then amplify
[00:04:17] it. So clarify why you're special and why someone should work with you and then figure out what to make.
[00:04:21] So I've been making videos for, I've been helping real estate agents around the country make videos
[00:04:25] to grow their business. So that means showing up as the authority, showing up as likeable, showing
[00:04:30] up as trustworthy and truly that's where it happens. This year I've been speaking at Inmin Connect.
[00:04:36] I was the keynote speaker at next home and at women's council of REALTORS. So I really,
[00:04:40] really love helping real estate agents because just like me, you are responsible for building your
[00:04:44] business and for building the life that you deserve. So I really understand as a fellow business owner.
[00:04:51] So I wanted to focus on today about the idea of really showing people why you're worth the investment.
[00:04:57] And I'm going to clarify it, this is a little different than just seeming likeable.
[00:05:02] That is actually a part of it, but that's really not what we're focusing on today.
[00:05:06] We're really talking about someone figures, okay, I'm going to pay this person commission,
[00:05:09] I'm going to you know work with them. What are they bringing me? Why should I work with this person
[00:05:13] over that person? So first a couple of ideas on content pieces that you should be making that will
[00:05:20] speak to the why work with me, right? Why invest with me? What what what is the reason that I am better
[00:05:27] than someone else? So first of all, I would say be clear about how you work. What is your process?
[00:05:34] So one of my incredible agents, Debbie, she has this really great process where she has like a blog,
[00:05:39] you know, she has a blog post and other posts that really take people through their process.
[00:05:43] Some of my other clients make videos like a video series how we work together. What is the process
[00:05:48] look like? What is the timeline? So people really understand how you work together. They can also get
[00:05:53] an understanding of what you know, I wouldn't you know, make them in content as maybe a phone call.
[00:05:59] How you work together and the commission and all of that. Then we're talking about
[00:06:05] building up your credibility. So it's not just that you sell homes or you help people buy homes,
[00:06:12] right? And I'm often a little tough on people that the just listed and just sold is not enough.
[00:06:17] It is the basic foundational part of having a business, but it is not enough to say that is my whole
[00:06:26] social media content strategy is just posting my listings. It's not enough.
[00:06:31] So one of the things that you can really do to help people understand why you are going to be
[00:06:37] a good steward of their money is showing them the wins that you've been able to bring for your clients.
[00:06:43] So that means how have you helped people save money, right? Maybe they're buying a home or an
[00:06:50] apartment with you and you have helped them save money. Start telling that story. You're helping
[00:06:56] somebody make money, right? So I've had clients, I've had real estate agents that I've worked with
[00:07:01] being saying, you know, I was in the steel and then I helped them, you know, buy the home for $100,000
[00:07:07] less and this is how it happened. So really take people into the process of how you help your clients.
[00:07:15] So that can be money you have saved them. This is this can be a pride you've gotten a higher list price.
[00:07:23] And it can be all any of those wins you're talking about, but really bringing it out and being
[00:07:29] very specific. So when you're storytelling this, it's what did this client get by working with you?
[00:07:38] Right? So what is it that you brought that helps the client save money or make more money or have
[00:07:45] a more seamless experience as another one, right? Sometimes maybe you got what you wanted out of it,
[00:07:50] but it was a tough go. Maybe you didn't partner well, right? Like maybe it was a bad match. So it can be
[00:07:55] ease of work, money save, money earned, good investment, showing you somewhere you wouldn't have
[00:08:02] found yourself. And so when you're really thinking about these wins, financial ones are super strong.
[00:08:09] So if you can show the clients that you are someone who's going to help them make more money,
[00:08:15] that is a really important thing that people want to be hearing, especially when they're holding
[00:08:20] tighter to their wallet. So when we're talking about the storytelling, a couple ways to do it.
[00:08:26] So number one, you can take people through behind the scenes of the deal. So that means you might want
[00:08:32] to get on camera and take someone through that deal. So you know, I worked with Jane. She was looking
[00:08:40] for this table poem. Our challenges were this and this was the output. So what a couple things to
[00:08:47] really look out for when you have that. Number one, sometimes we're telling too much of the story.
[00:08:52] So you really want to hammer in just the important parts. I just did this with one of my agents
[00:08:56] based in Michigan. And one thing that we did together was she, I had her tell the story. So literally
[00:09:04] hold up a voice memo in your phone, tell the story. I was working with this client. They were looking
[00:09:09] in this area. They were looking in this budget. The challenge was this. They moved here from another
[00:09:13] state or another country. Put that in writing. Pop it in chat GPT. So put in chat GPT and have chat GPT
[00:09:22] ask chat GPT or another AI tool. Please break down this story into a short social media video.
[00:09:33] Highlight the challenges and opportunities. Highlight how I helped them and really pull the
[00:09:39] lesson from the story. We took this basically like a just sort of a lot of information. We talked it
[00:09:47] out. We put it into AI and it came up with a really strong social media video, which was based off
[00:09:53] of her and her clients work. So again, we don't want to use AI obviously if it's not our own experience
[00:09:58] as we're really showing up so that we people trust you with their money that you are really someone
[00:10:04] worth working with. But we're also talking about making sure that it's clear. So in using AI, you want to
[00:10:14] make sure you're putting in your story and your experiences and why you're the best, but have AI
[00:10:19] help you with the storytelling part of it. Because sometimes we end up getting a little lost in our own
[00:10:24] story, putting in too much information and not really clarifying, here's the gem. Here's the beautiful
[00:10:32] peony in the garden versus the other information, the grass, the lower flowers, whatever. You have to
[00:10:37] show them this is the important part of the story that's really worth holding on to. So the two
[00:10:43] pieces of content that I think are really, really, really super important to show people why you're
[00:10:48] worth the investment. Number one, I would definitely share how you work with people. They will understand
[00:10:53] how you do things, but also start to hear your perspective on things. So as you're taking them
[00:10:59] through the timeline or what they need to do, they're going to kind of get to understand your
[00:11:03] personality as well. And that's an important part, obviously, of working together. So I recommend the
[00:11:08] videos on how you work together and then the wins. So as I mentioned before, the wins really you
[00:11:15] want to be showing off how you were able to benefit that client, right? How did you make their life
[00:11:21] easier? How did you help them find their dream home? How did you help them make more money or save money?
[00:11:26] Really all of those things. So you want to be the steward of their investment, the mayor of the
[00:11:32] town, the person who makes their life amazing and super easy and valuable. So okay, I want to let you
[00:11:40] enjoy the weather, right? Enjoy the summertime. I am Kim Rittberg, K-I-M, R-I-T-T-V-E-R-G. Drop me a
