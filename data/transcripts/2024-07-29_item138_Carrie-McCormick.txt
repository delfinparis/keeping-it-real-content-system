[00:01:42] I'm your guide and host through the show.
[00:01:44] And today on the show is our monthly series called the Monday Market Minute with Carrie McCormick from the Carrie McCormick real estate group without properties.
[00:01:53] Now Carrie is a top 1% producer in Chicago with over 20 years of experience helping buyers, sellers and investors.
[00:02:01] In the last 12 months out of 46,000 real estate agents here in the Chicago land area, Carrie is currently ranked number 6 out of 46,000 agents.
[00:02:10] She's a true superstar and an expert in everything from first time home buyers, veteran investors and luxury properties.
[00:02:16] She also works with a lot of developers and is often chosen to represent their high end developments.
[00:02:22] I live in one of these developments that was a Carrie development.
[00:02:25] So I can attest to just how popular she is.
[00:02:29] Please visit her at her website, Carrie McCormick, R E.com.
[00:02:33] But for you, I also want you to follow her on Instagram.
[00:02:37] She has an amazing Instagram account.
[00:02:38] And most importantly, she does it all herself.
[00:02:41] So you can really see what an agent who is a top 1% agent is doing on Instagram and it really helps her business.
[00:02:47] That's Carrie McCormick real estate.
[00:02:50] We will have a link to that in the show notes.
[00:02:51] Again, Carrie McCormick real estate is where you find her on Instagram.
[00:02:54] Carrie, welcome to the show yet again.
[00:02:56] Thank you.
[00:02:57] Thank you.
[00:02:57] You've been with us.
[00:02:59] You've been with us this the beginning.
[00:02:59] And I will tell you that gosh, I think we've been doing this six years, five or six years now.
[00:03:05] And I get more comments about your episodes than anybody.
[00:03:10] Well, a lot of that's because I live we both live here in Chicago.
[00:03:14] A lot of we have a lot of Chicago listeners and they are familiar with you.
[00:03:16] Of course, they're always like, oh my god, you're so lucky to have Carrie on the show.
[00:03:19] And I'm like, I know how lucky we are.
[00:03:22] And I wanted to brag a little bit about you because not everybody who listens might really know, you know, what you do.
[00:03:31] And so I just want to share some data with you.
[00:03:33] And I hope it doesn't make you feel too embarrassed.
[00:03:36] But let's hear what you got.
[00:03:39] So this is good.
[00:03:40] These are all good stuff.
[00:03:41] But I just want to share with you, you know, what Carrie does because some of these numbers, I can't even rent my mind around.
[00:03:48] And by the way, we should start by saying she's an individual agent.
[00:03:52] She has a group, but it's really just her and she has a bunch of assistants, months of help.
[00:03:56] But it is just her.
[00:03:58] So I want to I want to preface that by because again, if you you were on a team with 20 people,
[00:04:03] it wouldn't have quite the same impact about what I'm going to say, but it is really just you.
[00:04:07] Okay, year to date, 197, no, I'm sorry, sorry, not year to date.
[00:04:13] That was last 12 months.
[00:04:15] That was amazing to almost 200 million, but year to date, 113 million.
[00:04:21] Her average sales price is 1.66 million.
[00:04:26] Her, let's see, number of close transactions, 68 year to date, current activity.
[00:04:34] Now, I want everybody to sort of bend their brain around this.
[00:04:38] 48 active listening listings for $125 million.
[00:04:43] 48 active listings for 125 million.
[00:04:46] She has six pending listings.
[00:04:48] She has 14 under contract right now.
[00:04:50] So that is that is just how lucky we are to get carry because my goodness.
[00:04:56] By the way, to look at so she's been in the business for 20 plus years, for agents that have been in the business at the same tenure as her across the country, the average production that they do is only 2.6 million.
[00:05:13] And carries doing, you know, 112 plus year to date.
[00:05:17] So yes, we are very, very honored to have you.
[00:05:21] And as always, I hope that's not too embarrassing for you, but I just wanted to brag a little bit about how lucky we are to have you.
[00:05:28] Oh, nice.
[00:05:30] So what's going on?
[00:05:31] Yeah, well, thank you for that.
[00:05:33] And just on that note.
[00:05:35] I am an individual agent.
[00:05:37] So I think that that's important to purpose.
[00:05:40] I don't have a big team of agents.
[00:05:43] And I purposefully have formed, you know, my business that way.
[00:05:48] It's just it's that's just how it works for me.
[00:05:50] I do have four amazing.
[00:05:53] I don't like using the word assistance, but my support team, right?
[00:05:58] And they support me in everything that I do.
[00:06:01] And they each have their individual roles.
[00:06:03] And we work.
[00:06:05] I always think of like a successful football team or baseball team just referencing sports is you can't win a game alone.
[00:06:15] You just can't unless you're playing golf, I guess.
[00:06:17] You know, but you really can't.
[00:06:19] So again, I've got the most incredible dedicated team.
[00:06:24] We laugh.
[00:06:25] I, you know, we work hard.
[00:06:27] We play hard.
[00:06:28] I just feel very fortunate.
[00:06:29] So I think that is a big part of my success is having my team around me.
[00:06:37] So this is I think a challenging year for agents at least.
[00:06:41] Although we are seeing the market is improving, of course, a bit.
[00:06:45] Rates still haven't dropped to where I think anyone would prefer them to be.
[00:06:49] But I guess that's a sign of a good economy.
[00:06:51] So that's a positive overall, maybe not so much for REALTORS, but who work with buyers, but certainly a good sign for the economy.
[00:06:59] But inventory is still kind of low.
[00:07:02] And there's things that are sitting out there that aren't selling, but there isn't a lot of inventory and rates are still not where they would like to be for REALTORS.
[00:07:13] Did you learn anything in the first half of the years you reflect back?
[00:07:17] Was there any lessons to learn anything that sort of surprised you or just curious on what your thoughts were as reflecting back on first part of 2024?
[00:07:26] Well, this business is always full of surprises.
[00:07:29] You know, I've been in it a long time and you know, every day is a different day and it's it.
[00:07:35] The road is a winding road, right?
[00:07:38] So there's there's been a lot, but I would say looking back.
[00:07:41] The first half of the year because of all the challenges that the market offers us, you know, whether it's inventory pricing, interest rates,
[00:07:51] life in general, clients have been a little bit more on edge this year.
[00:07:58] So for me, I've tailored my business and adjusted my business a little bit more client focused in the sense of picking up all of the details for them.
[00:08:11] You know, meaning, you know, again, everyone's life is so busy, whether it's washing windows in their house or doing, not me personally,
[00:08:19] but doing, you know, cleaning or taking care of the staging or taking care of repairs.
[00:08:24] The way I communicate with clients has has changed a little bit and you know, it's always for the better, right?
[00:08:31] And I'm not saying that I didn't do this before, but I'm, you know, taking the extra step and the taking the extra mile to make sure that my clients are happy, satisfied, and they're taking care of.
[00:08:44] There's a book and I'm going to say this and I'm trying to think with the name of the book is something about hospitality.
[00:08:52] It'll come to me as we're talking. I don't know. Do you know the book?
[00:08:56] No, but I'm looking it up as you're talking like unbelievable hospitality or exceptional hospitality or unresignable hospitality.
[00:09:05] Thank you. I would suggest everyone book. It is, it's not about real estate, but the underlying message will help all of us in our everyday life.
[00:09:20] And it's really just about if you think about going to a five star hotel or experience, whether it's in a restaurant, etc.
[00:09:27] And when people go the extra mile for you as a client, as a patient, as a guest, you will always remember how they made you feel, right?
[00:09:39] And this book just has, it's just, it's written so well. It's an easy read, but so I would say taking lessons from that book of just providing exceptional service and hospitality to my clients, because that's becoming the new norm of what.
[00:09:56] They're looking for.
[00:09:58] Yeah, and two, like I think technology has pushed that forward because people are now used to getting things very quickly and very efficiently.
[00:10:11] So they don't have a ton of patience, I think, for waiting around. So I think you do have to be probably the agent has to be a bit more timely these days.
[00:10:22] Yes, 100%. And, you know, my, my team here, I've always talked to them about, you know, speedy responses and.
[00:10:33] Again, just providing the extra mile, but that's going to lead me into what I wanted to talk to to everyone about today is AI, right?
[00:10:42] So I think AI is coming upon us at a great time, because again, having one manpower or, you know, whoever it is, you can't do it all.
[00:10:52] And AI, instead of being scared of it or feeling like it's going to replace something absolutely not, it's such an incredible tool to help us in our daily lives in real estate.
[00:11:02] So I just wanted to share some of the things that I've been using it for.
[00:11:09] And one, I'm sure everyone's doing this and it's the easiest thing, which is descriptions of properties, because it's funny right now I read the descriptions of properties.
[00:11:17] They are all starting to sound the same. Everyone's got the epitome or the opulence.
[00:11:22] I mean, these are words that chat GPT uses all the time.
[00:11:25] So you know, but you know, not and everyone knows this don't copy and paste it because it doesn't know everything, but it definitely can restructure a sentence for you.
[00:11:35] Or if you're struggling with how to describe a room, you can actually now put in pictures of a property.
[00:11:42] I can load 10 pictures into chat GPT and say, write a description that talks about these pictures, you know, this house.
[00:11:50] And it will look at the pictures and write a description of it again.
[00:11:56] It's not going to replace my words. It's not going to replace, but it starts me thinking, right? It kind of forms the whole description or paragraph for me.
[00:12:06] And then I can go in and change, you know, how I'm going to structure the remarks of this.
[00:12:12] I've even done it when I'm struggling with how to respond to a client in a, you know, a sensitive situation.
[00:12:19] You know, I put it in chat GPT. I know what I want it to say, but just the tone of it.
[00:12:25] What I've done to is I, they call it priming. You can prime chat GPT to hear your voice.
[00:12:32] So I've inputted, you know, who I am to chat GPT. What my tone is.
[00:12:39] What, you know, I recorded certain things and uploaded it to chat GPT.
[00:12:44] So voice and hear my cadence and hear how I talk. And now when it responds from me, it's me.
[00:12:52] Oh wow.
[00:12:53] It's crazy. You know, but again, I'm not saying this is replacing me. It's just, it's just assisting me.
[00:13:00] And it's assisting me in writing. It's, you know, how to respond to certain things.
[00:13:05] So I find that such a valuable tool. So that's one thing is, you know, the property descriptions.
[00:13:12] The other thing I've done is the data insight.
[00:13:14] I go into obviously I'm in Chicago. So I go into my Chicago stats, which are graphs.
[00:13:22] They're percentages. You know, it's year over year or, you know, different stats about our market.
[00:13:28] And it's, you know, sometimes they're very intense graphs, etc. And I can put this into chat GPT. I've got a certain, they call them.
[00:13:38] I don't know all the lingo yet, you know, like a plug in a plug in that will read data.
[00:13:43] And I'll say summarize this in one paragraph. And it does.
[00:13:48] So it's unbelievable.
[00:13:52] I love that. I think you could do that also with, yeah, with MLS data too.
[00:13:58] You could probably export MLS data, especially any insights from your local market that, you know, but you're not totally sure what the insights are.
[00:14:07] You just can throw the data in and say, hey, evaluate this and any patterns or trends or insights.
[00:14:14] Yeah, that's really cool. I love that.
[00:14:17] I'll tell you a way. I'm using it right now. So I'm on the recruiting side.
[00:14:20] So I'm always looking to recruit REALTORS. So I started realizing I would like to do more short form video.
[00:14:26] Just like agents should be doing lots of short form video to reach their clients on social media.
[00:14:31] I should be doing the same to reach REALTORS who are looking for, you know, content about brokerage stuff.
[00:14:37] So I was said, okay, I'm going to do a whole month with videos about local vendor part local local market partnerships.
[00:14:47] So you can go into a local market that you specialize in and, you know, get to know all the different small businesses and maybe do some co branding things where you have coupons or whatever.
[00:14:57] There's lots of different ways. And so I put that idea into chat GBT and I said, can you give me like 30 ideas for a 60 second video with this topic.
[00:15:06] And it gave me 30 ideas. Not not all of them were great. But I was like, ooh, I can make videos out of like 10 of these 30.
[00:15:13] So there, there we go. That was, and then I could technically go back in and say, write me a 60 second script for each one of these 10.
[00:15:21] Right. And, you know, it's not going to be perfect, but it's going to be a start.
[00:15:24] And then I, like you were saying, I go in and I just edit it. And there we go. So it's a great way to use for, you know, creative prompts for, you know, parts of your business.
[00:15:33] So if you're thinking about, oh, I'd like to make some videos for social media for my clients, then I would think about what questions your clients ask you.
[00:15:40] Throw those questions into chat GBT and say, write a little 60 second script answering this question from a REALTOR's perspective.
[00:15:47] And then you can add in your own facts and figures to it as well. But it's a great way just to get some content made.
[00:15:52] Well, and it also does content scheduling. So if you say I want to do an Instagram post and it'll tell you on, you know, or just give me a content calendar.
[00:16:04] Right. It's going to tell you day one. This is where you're talking about day two. This is what you talk about. It's, again, it's such a just useful tool for all of us.
[00:16:13] But, you know, again, I keep saying this and you said it too is you've got to add your own info into there because what I'm starting to see too, again, I mentioned the descriptions is they're all starting to sound the same.
[00:16:25] And you know, people can see that.
[00:16:27] And just from an SEO ranking, they, it can tell when anything is auto generated from chat GBT to end what Instagram and probably Google will do pretty soon is that they're going to see it just copied and pasted and
[00:16:43] regurgitated and they're going to just start pushing that down because they do like anything that's authentic.
[00:16:52] So you do have to be careful with that as well. You know, so the other I was going to talk about blog posts and social media, which is great scripting to we talked about like video scripting of just, you know, using it that way.
[00:17:07] And then analyzing the trends we talked about that too. There's so many different plugins that you can that you can research and use the other thing too.
[00:17:18] And the last thing is doing an AI bot of yourself to answer questions. I don't have like a call center and I don't do like the Zillow leads or any of the lead generation tools. I don't pay for leads.
[00:17:30] But a lot of my colleagues do and I found that there is a way that you can have the system auto respond to these leads as well.
[00:17:40] So again, for any of those people who are doing that, I think that's an incredible tool.
[00:17:45] Yeah, I've noticed that on a lot of support, like online support services where you know click to chat right now with whatever product or service I'm meeting help with.
[00:17:55] And I think most of the time I'm actually chatting not with a real person, but often I get the answer I need.
[00:18:01] And so I think I think that's a that's a fantastic idea. I also have an idea too for anyone that is thinking about doing how about a client appreciation event.
[00:18:12] I have two ideas. So for client appreciation events, if you're like, I don't know what to do, that could be a prompt. Hey chat GBT, you know, come up with 20 different REALTOR sponsored.
[00:18:24] You know, client appreciation events that you know that my clients might want to attend. Here's, you know, give it a little bit more information about, you know, maybe where you live and how big your databases and it'll come up with some pretty.
[00:18:36] The more information you give at the better, the other option I was thinking too is if you're looking to do webinars, I'm starting to see agents do more online webinars like how to buy a condo, how to buy your first home.
[00:18:47] Moving from renting to buying or investing in real estate or buying a second property, whatever the topic may be or navigating.
[00:18:56] Here's what the public needs to know about the NAR settlement or whatever the topic may be, you can put those prompts into chat GBT and say, hey, create a slide deck for me.
[00:19:08] And there are plugins that will actually just create the slides for you. You know, you'll probably have to go and do smetting, but it will at least do the majority of the lifting for you.
[00:19:16] So you can use that if you're like, I don't know how to put together a deck presentation. I'm not really good at PowerPoint. Yeah, I'm not either. So, you know, that's a place where you can, you can get at least all the content.
[00:19:26] And then what you could do if you could pay for a plugin that actually builds the slides for you or sometimes chat GBT can do that too, or you can hire somebody for $20 to put a slide deck together if you have all the content.
[00:19:40] You know, there are some people that can knock that stuff out in 10 minutes and make it look really, really sharp and see me pay a little bit, but you don't have to build everything on your own anymore, which is kind of nice.
[00:19:50] It's incredible. And I was just going to also just let everyone know, make sure that you upgrade your chat GPT to 4.0. It is a paid version. I already know it's $15 a month.
[00:19:59] But if you just go the standard free one, a lot of these tools are not available.
[00:20:04] But again, if you upgrade to the 4.0, you're going to have access to all of these great tools.
[00:20:10] Yeah, for $15 a month, and if all you ever did was throw in your descriptions and say, write a more, you know, persuasive property description or a more upbeat property description or, you know, whatever emotion you want to sort of elicit from the reader, then you just throw that in there and let it do its work and it'll probably do a decent job of getting you started there.
[00:20:36] And that's worth $15 a month to me because I think it's so thick and sell the can sell just help sell one home a little faster.
[00:20:43] You know, obviously that makes up for it. So I also too, I want to go back to social media because Carrie really is, she's such, Carrie is very modest and she works around the clock and she has a family and she's got her personal life and she does so many things.
[00:20:57] But the thing that in some ways I'm even more impressed with Carrie about aside from her incredible production is the fact that she also has time for social media because that is really for a lot of us a time suck at the time hole that takes our time and doesn't give us a lot of return.
[00:21:13] But you've really figured out how much time to put in how to do it. You like doing it, which is really fun. I find I've learned this about top producers that if they really enjoy something.
[00:21:26] Then it's kind of they'll do it themselves and that's something you clearly seem to enjoy because you put a lot of work into it.
[00:21:36] It's almost like a second job in a way and I don't mean you're on it all day long. You couldn't be. You're too busy, but you have to be on it part of the day just to, you know, be posting content.
[00:21:46] How important has social media been for you in the last like several years?
[00:21:50] Well, extremely important and I was a little bit of a pioneer years ago doing it.
[00:21:58] But it I think it's become such a staple in our marketing plan now and how we sell properties.
[00:22:05] So the reason I like doing it, I mean, I am a very creative person at heart and I do enjoy doing the social media part.
[00:22:12] But I think it is important that each person is authentic and it's funny because anyone who's on social media to, you know, like people.
[00:22:23] And this is not a braggy thing, but you know, I'll be an appointment like, oh, it's so nice to meet you. I feel like I know you on social media, you know, from social media. It's just like watching the Kardashians or something.
[00:22:33] You just feel like or any of that reality show, right? You just feel like you get to know somebody from their social media, you know, their personality and what they like what they don't like.
[00:22:43] I don't know. So it's kind of fun just from a personality standpoint and getting to know people. But it's.
[00:22:52] It's been a tremendous tool, you know, not only for a branding standpoint, but to sell these properties because I get to showcase some of these most amazing properties and people love watching and looking at the inside of homes.
[00:23:05] Yeah, absolutely. And you do such a cool job. You do a lot of fun video stuff. You do a lot of, you know, I would say I don't even know what it's what it's called, but messing with sort of time.
[00:23:17] Whereas you'll do a you'll do a video tour and it will speed up and slow down and do some really cool sort of camera tricks.
[00:23:26] Do you do enjoy learning about how to do those? They're pretty pretty neat stuff.
[00:23:31] Yeah, no, I am trying to always push the envelope on different things and, you know, come up with something just different, right? Because again, you just like anything, any advertising, you just got to shake it up a little bit, right?
[00:23:44] And everyone starts doing the same thing and, you know, just got to be creative and and be you.
[00:23:49] Well, I really encourage everybody to visit Carrie's Instagram, which is Carrie McCormick real estate. So at Carrie McCormick real estate.
[00:23:56] And I really want you to look for a few things. One is look at the professionalism.
[00:24:02] That's obviously a subjective thing to look at. But I think we could agree that Carrie really emulates professionalism in her dress, in her style, in her her appearance, her manner.
[00:24:13] The way she speaks, it's it's very, very calm and confident. There's a calmness and a serenity to her.
[00:24:21] The not an excitable. She's not excitable. She's she's she's becomes across really tranquil in a way, but but alert tranquil and alert at the same time, which I think is, which is, which is really, really nice because that's, you know, you always want somebody who's not as reactive, but is is on top of things.
[00:24:39] And you come across that way very well. And also to look at just the production value. Now notice she and once you all to realize she doesn't have, you know, this, this giant camera crew following her.
[00:24:51] These are things she's doing herself. So notice the production value. Now, obviously, you know, she'll do drone shots and things obviously that are are in, you know, drones.
[00:24:59] But she'll incorporate those into her own videos. What watch it? Notice how seamless it is and how professional it looks. It really does look like you have this massive team trailing behind you with the boom mic and all the different cameras. And that's just not the case.
[00:25:14] And yeah, obviously you get your places professionally for tire photographed and that, but it is really impressive. So guys check out to see what she's doing that is very, very different than what most agents are doing on Instagram and other social media channels.
[00:25:28] So at carry McCormick real estate is where you go and also to Chicago does have people that move into the city from other parts of the country. I moved from central Illinois. I wasn't.
[00:25:40] I was Chicago person growing up. I moved here. Of course people move out of Chicago as well. Maybe my parents are looking to to retired. I'm to Florida at some point. So a lot of people do that. Right. So we have, I guess we would call we have a feeder. We have a feeder market here. We have feeder markets that.
[00:25:54] We do. But come into Chicago and then we send people away at once they retire often to more warmer clients. So this is a great opportunity. All of our listeners. If you want to develop a relationship with carry because maybe you have some great clients that need really good attention and need a good agent.
[00:26:14] And she would be a great fit for you or maybe vice versa. She's got clients that retire and move and how life events, you know, get them out of the city. And she would love to talk to you because she's going to need a great REALTOR in your area someday as well.

Now Carrie is a top 1% producer in Chicago with over 20 years of experience helping buyers, sellers and investors. In the last 12 months out of 46,000 real estate agents here in the Chicago land area, Carrie is currently ranked number 6 out of 46,000 agents. She's a true superstar and an expert in everything from first time home buyers, veteran investors and luxury properties. She also works with a lot of developers and is often chosen to represent their high end developments. I live in one of these developments that was a Carrie development. So I can attest to just how popular she is. Please visit her at her website, Carrie McCormick, R E.com. But for you, I also want you to follow her on Instagram. She has an amazing Instagram account. And most importantly, she does it all herself. So you can really see what an agent who is a top 1% agent is doing on Instagram and it really helps her business. That's Carrie McCormick real estate. We will have a link to that in the show notes. Again, Carrie McCormick real estate is where you find her on Instagram. Carrie, welcome to the show yet again. Thank you. Thank you. You've been with us. You've been with us this the beginning. And I will tell you that gosh, I think we've been doing this six years, five or six years now. And I get more comments about your episodes than anybody. Well, a lot of that's because I live we both live here in Chicago. A lot of we have a lot of Chicago listeners and they are familiar with you. Of course, they're always like, oh my god, you're so lucky to have Carrie on the show. And I'm like, I know how lucky we are. And I wanted to brag a little bit about you because not everybody who listens might really know, you know, what you do. And so I just want to share some data with you. And I hope it doesn't make you feel too embarrassed. But let's hear what you got. So this is good. These are all good stuff. But I just want to share with you, you know, what Carrie does because some of these numbers, I can't even rent my mind around. And by the way, we should start by saying she's an individual agent. She has a group, but it's really just her and she has a bunch of assistants, months of help. But it is just her. So I want to I want to preface that by because again, if you you were on a team with 20 people, it wouldn't have quite the same impact about what I'm going to say, but it is really just you. Okay, year to date, 197, no, I'm sorry, sorry, not year to date. That was last 12 months. That was amazing to almost 200 million, but year to date, 113 million. Her average sales price is 1.66 million. Her, let's see, number of close transactions, 68 year to date, current activity. Now, I want everybody to sort of bend their brain around this. 48 active listening listings for $125 million. 48 active listings for 125 million. She has six pending listings. She has 14 under contract right now. So that is that is just how lucky we are to get carry because my goodness. By the way, to look at so she's been in the business for 20 plus years, for agents that have been in the business at the same tenure as her across the country, the average production that they do is only 2.6 million. And carries doing, you know, 112 plus year to date. So yes, we are very, very honored to have you. And as always, I hope that's not too embarrassing for you, but I just wanted to brag a little bit about how lucky we are to have you. Oh, nice. So what's going on? Yeah, well, thank you for that. And just on that note. I am an individual agent. So I think that that's important to purpose. I don't have a big team of agents. And I purposefully have formed, you know, my business that way. It's just it's that's just how it works for me. I do have four amazing. I don't like using the word assistance, but my support team, right? And they support me in everything that I do. And they each have their individual roles. And we work. I always think of like a successful football team or baseball team just referencing sports is you can't win a game alone. You just can't unless you're playing golf, I guess. You know, but you really can't. So again, I've got the most incredible dedicated team. We laugh. I, you know, we work hard. We play hard. I just feel very fortunate. So I think that is a big part of my success is having my team around me. So this is I think a challenging year for agents at least. Although we are seeing the market is improving, of course, a bit. Rates still haven't dropped to where I think anyone would prefer them to be. But I guess that's a sign of a good economy. So that's a positive overall, maybe not so much for REALTORS, but who work with buyers, but certainly a good sign for the economy. But inventory is still kind of low. And there's things that are sitting out there that aren't selling, but there isn't a lot of inventory and rates are still not where they would like to be for REALTORS. Did you learn anything in the first half of the years you reflect back? Was there any lessons to learn anything that sort of surprised you or just curious on what your thoughts were as reflecting back on first part of 2024? Well, this business is always full of surprises. You know, I've been in it a long time and you know, every day is a different day and it's it. The road is a winding road, right? So there's there's been a lot, but I would say looking back. The first half of the year because of all the challenges that the market offers us, you know, whether it's inventory pricing, interest rates, life in general, clients have been a little bit more on edge this year. So for me, I've tailored my business and adjusted my business a little bit more client focused in the sense of picking up all of the details for them. You know, meaning, you know, again, everyone's life is so busy, whether it's washing windows in their house or doing, not me personally, but doing, you know, cleaning or taking care of the staging or taking care of repairs. The way I communicate with clients has has changed a little bit and you know, it's always for the better, right? And I'm not saying that I didn't do this before, but I'm, you know, taking the extra step and the taking the extra mile to make sure that my clients are happy, satisfied, and they're taking care of. There's a book and I'm going to say this and I'm trying to think with the name of the book is something about hospitality. It'll come to me as we're talking. I don't know. Do you know the book? No, but I'm looking it up as you're talking like unbelievable hospitality or exceptional hospitality or unresignable hospitality. Thank you. I would suggest everyone book. It is, it's not about real estate, but the underlying message will help all of us in our everyday life. And it's really just about if you think about going to a five star hotel or experience, whether it's in a restaurant, etc. And when people go the extra mile for you as a client, as a patient, as a guest, you will always remember how they made you feel, right? And this book just has, it's just, it's written so well. It's an easy read, but so I would say taking lessons from that book of just providing exceptional service and hospitality to my clients, because that's becoming the new norm of what. They're looking for. Yeah, and two, like I think technology has pushed that forward because people are now used to getting things very quickly and very efficiently. So they don't have a ton of patience, I think, for waiting around. So I think you do have to be probably the agent has to be a bit more timely these days. Yes, 100%. And, you know, my, my team here, I've always talked to them about, you know, speedy responses and. Again, just providing the extra mile, but that's going to lead me into what I wanted to talk to to everyone about today is AI, right? So I think AI is coming upon us at a great time, because again, having one manpower or, you know, whoever it is, you can't do it all. And AI, instead of being scared of it or feeling like it's going to replace something absolutely not, it's such an incredible tool to help us in our daily lives in real estate. So I just wanted to share some of the things that I've been using it for. And one, I'm sure everyone's doing this and it's the easiest thing, which is descriptions of properties, because it's funny right now I read the descriptions of properties. They are all starting to sound the same. Everyone's got the epitome or the opulence. I mean, these are words that chat GPT uses all the time. So you know, but you know, not and everyone knows this don't copy and paste it because it doesn't know everything, but it definitely can restructure a sentence for you. Or if you're struggling with how to describe a room, you can actually now put in pictures of a property. I can load 10 pictures into chat GPT and say, write a description that talks about these pictures, you know, this house. And it will look at the pictures and write a description of it again. It's not going to replace my words. It's not going to replace, but it starts me thinking, right? It kind of forms the whole description or paragraph for me. And then I can go in and change, you know, how I'm going to structure the remarks of this. I've even done it when I'm struggling with how to respond to a client in a, you know, a sensitive situation. You know, I put it in chat GPT. I know what I want it to say, but just the tone of it. What I've done to is I, they call it priming. You can prime chat GPT to hear your voice. So I've inputted, you know, who I am to chat GPT. What my tone is. What, you know, I recorded certain things and uploaded it to chat GPT. So voice and hear my cadence and hear how I talk. And now when it responds from me, it's me. Oh wow. It's crazy. You know, but again, I'm not saying this is replacing me. It's just, it's just assisting me. And it's assisting me in writing. It's, you know, how to respond to certain things. So I find that such a valuable tool. So that's one thing is, you know, the property descriptions. The other thing I've done is the data insight. I go into obviously I'm in Chicago. So I go into my Chicago stats, which are graphs. They're percentages. You know, it's year over year or, you know, different stats about our market. And it's, you know, sometimes they're very intense graphs, etc. And I can put this into chat GPT. I've got a certain, they call them. I don't know all the lingo yet, you know, like a plug in a plug in that will read data. And I'll say summarize this in one paragraph. And it does. So it's unbelievable. I love that. I think you could do that also with, yeah, with MLS data too. You could probably export MLS data, especially any insights from your local market that, you know, but you're not totally sure what the insights are. You just can throw the data in and say, hey, evaluate this and any patterns or trends or insights. Yeah, that's really cool. I love that. I'll tell you a way. I'm using it right now. So I'm on the recruiting side. So I'm always looking to recruit REALTORS. So I started realizing I would like to do more short form video. Just like agents should be doing lots of short form video to reach their clients on social media. I should be doing the same to reach REALTORS who are looking for, you know, content about brokerage stuff. So I was said, okay, I'm going to do a whole month with videos about local vendor part local local market partnerships. So you can go into a local market that you specialize in and, you know, get to know all the different small businesses and maybe do some co branding things where you have coupons or whatever. There's lots of different ways. And so I put that idea into chat GBT and I said, can you give me like 30 ideas for a 60 second video with this topic. And it gave me 30 ideas. Not not all of them were great. But I was like, ooh, I can make videos out of like 10 of these 30. So there, there we go. That was, and then I could technically go back in and say, write me a 60 second script for each one of these 10. Right. And, you know, it's not going to be perfect, but it's going to be a start. And then I, like you were saying, I go in and I just edit it. And there we go. So it's a great way to use for, you know, creative prompts for, you know, parts of your business. So if you're thinking about, oh, I'd like to make some videos for social media for my clients, then I would think about what questions your clients ask you. Throw those questions into chat GBT and say, write a little 60 second script answering this question from a REALTOR's perspective. And then you can add in your own facts and figures to it as well. But it's a great way just to get some content made. Well, and it also does content scheduling. So if you say I want to do an Instagram post and it'll tell you on, you know, or just give me a content calendar. Right. It's going to tell you day one. This is where you're talking about day two. This is what you talk about. It's, again, it's such a just useful tool for all of us. But, you know, again, I keep saying this and you said it too is you've got to add your own info into there because what I'm starting to see too, again, I mentioned the descriptions is they're all starting to sound the same. And you know, people can see that. And just from an SEO ranking, they, it can tell when anything is auto generated from chat GBT to end what Instagram and probably Google will do pretty soon is that they're going to see it just copied and pasted and regurgitated and they're going to just start pushing that down because they do like anything that's authentic. So you do have to be careful with that as well. You know, so the other I was going to talk about blog posts and social media, which is great scripting to we talked about like video scripting of just, you know, using it that way. And then analyzing the trends we talked about that too. There's so many different plugins that you can that you can research and use the other thing too. And the last thing is doing an AI bot of yourself to answer questions. I don't have like a call center and I don't do like the Zillow leads or any of the lead generation tools. I don't pay for leads. But a lot of my colleagues do and I found that there is a way that you can have the system auto respond to these leads as well. So again, for any of those people who are doing that, I think that's an incredible tool. Yeah, I've noticed that on a lot of support, like online support services where you know click to chat right now with whatever product or service I'm meeting help with. And I think most of the time I'm actually chatting not with a real person, but often I get the answer I need. And so I think I think that's a that's a fantastic idea. I also have an idea too for anyone that is thinking about doing how about a client appreciation event. I have two ideas. So for client appreciation events, if you're like, I don't know what to do, that could be a prompt. Hey chat GBT, you know, come up with 20 different REALTOR sponsored. You know, client appreciation events that you know that my clients might want to attend. Here's, you know, give it a little bit more information about, you know, maybe where you live and how big your databases and it'll come up with some pretty. The more information you give at the better, the other option I was thinking too is if you're looking to do webinars, I'm starting to see agents do more online webinars like how to buy a condo, how to buy your first home. Moving from renting to buying or investing in real estate or buying a second property, whatever the topic may be or navigating. Here's what the public needs to know about the NAR settlement or whatever the topic may be, you can put those prompts into chat GBT and say, hey, create a slide deck for me. And there are plugins that will actually just create the slides for you. You know, you'll probably have to go and do smetting, but it will at least do the majority of the lifting for you. So you can use that if you're like, I don't know how to put together a deck presentation. I'm not really good at PowerPoint. Yeah, I'm not either. So, you know, that's a place where you can, you can get at least all the content. And then what you could do if you could pay for a plugin that actually builds the slides for you or sometimes chat GBT can do that too, or you can hire somebody for $20 to put a slide deck together if you have all the content. You know, there are some people that can knock that stuff out in 10 minutes and make it look really, really sharp and see me pay a little bit, but you don't have to build everything on your own anymore, which is kind of nice. It's incredible. And I was just going to also just let everyone know, make sure that you upgrade your chat GPT to 4.0. It is a paid version. I already know it's $15 a month. But if you just go the standard free one, a lot of these tools are not available. But again, if you upgrade to the 4.0, you're going to have access to all of these great tools. Yeah, for $15 a month, and if all you ever did was throw in your descriptions and say, write a more, you know, persuasive property description or a more upbeat property description or, you know, whatever emotion you want to sort of elicit from the reader, then you just throw that in there and let it do its work and it'll probably do a decent job of getting you started there. And that's worth $15 a month to me because I think it's so thick and sell the can sell just help sell one home a little faster. You know, obviously that makes up for it. So I also too, I want to go back to social media because Carrie really is, she's such, Carrie is very modest and she works around the clock and she has a family and she's got her personal life and she does so many things. But the thing that in some ways I'm even more impressed with Carrie about aside from her incredible production is the fact that she also has time for social media because that is really for a lot of us a time suck at the time hole that takes our time and doesn't give us a lot of return. But you've really figured out how much time to put in how to do it. You like doing it, which is really fun. I find I've learned this about top producers that if they really enjoy something. Then it's kind of they'll do it themselves and that's something you clearly seem to enjoy because you put a lot of work into it. It's almost like a second job in a way and I don't mean you're on it all day long. You couldn't be. You're too busy, but you have to be on it part of the day just to, you know, be posting content. How important has social media been for you in the last like several years? Well, extremely important and I was a little bit of a pioneer years ago doing it. But it I think it's become such a staple in our marketing plan now and how we sell properties. So the reason I like doing it, I mean, I am a very creative person at heart and I do enjoy doing the social media part. But I think it is important that each person is authentic and it's funny because anyone who's on social media to, you know, like people. And this is not a braggy thing, but you know, I'll be an appointment like, oh, it's so nice to meet you. I feel like I know you on social media, you know, from social media. It's just like watching the Kardashians or something. You just feel like or any of that reality show, right? You just feel like you get to know somebody from their social media, you know, their personality and what they like what they don't like. I don't know. So it's kind of fun just from a personality standpoint and getting to know people. But it's. It's been a tremendous tool, you know, not only for a branding standpoint, but to sell these properties because I get to showcase some of these most amazing properties and people love watching and looking at the inside of homes. Yeah, absolutely. And you do such a cool job. You do a lot of fun video stuff. You do a lot of, you know, I would say I don't even know what it's what it's called, but messing with sort of time. Whereas you'll do a you'll do a video tour and it will speed up and slow down and do some really cool sort of camera tricks. Do you do enjoy learning about how to do those? They're pretty pretty neat stuff. Yeah, no, I am trying to always push the envelope on different things and, you know, come up with something just different, right? Because again, you just like anything, any advertising, you just got to shake it up a little bit, right? And everyone starts doing the same thing and, you know, just got to be creative and and be you. Well, I really encourage everybody to visit Carrie's Instagram, which is Carrie McCormick real estate. So at Carrie McCormick real estate. And I really want you to look for a few things. One is look at the professionalism. That's obviously a subjective thing to look at. But I think we could agree that Carrie really emulates professionalism in her dress, in her style, in her her appearance, her manner. The way she speaks, it's it's very, very calm and confident. There's a calmness and a serenity to her. The not an excitable. She's not excitable. She's she's she's becomes across really tranquil in a way, but but alert tranquil and alert at the same time, which I think is, which is, which is really, really nice because that's, you know, you always want somebody who's not as reactive, but is is on top of things. And you come across that way very well. And also to look at just the production value. Now notice she and once you all to realize she doesn't have, you know, this, this giant camera crew following her. These are things she's doing herself. So notice the production value. Now, obviously, you know, she'll do drone shots and things obviously that are are in, you know, drones. But she'll incorporate those into her own videos. What watch it? Notice how seamless it is and how professional it looks. It really does look like you have this massive team trailing behind you with the boom mic and all the different cameras. And that's just not the case. And yeah, obviously you get your places professionally for tire photographed and that, but it is really impressive. So guys check out to see what she's doing that is very, very different than what most agents are doing on Instagram and other social media channels. So at carry McCormick real estate is where you go and also to Chicago does have people that move into the city from other parts of the country. I moved from central Illinois. I wasn't. I was Chicago person growing up. I moved here. Of course people move out of Chicago as well. Maybe my parents are looking to to retired. I'm to Florida at some point. So a lot of people do that. Right. So we have, I guess we would call we have a feeder. We have a feeder market here. We have feeder markets that. We do. But come into Chicago and then we send people away at once they retire often to more warmer clients. So this is a great opportunity. All of our listeners.
