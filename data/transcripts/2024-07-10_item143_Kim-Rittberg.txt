[00:01:38] [♪ OUTRO MUSIC PLAYING [♪
[00:01:43] Hello, Keeping Real Listeners.
[00:01:45] Happy summer.
[00:01:46] This is a special episode where I want you to listen to it.
[00:01:50] Doing your summer break or break,
[00:01:52] or nobody really has breaks, but doing the summer.
[00:01:55] And no matter where you are, if you're on vacation,
[00:01:57] or if you're in the office,
[00:01:59] it's I'm going to give you three tips
[00:02:00] of what you should be filming this summer.
[00:02:03] So today I'm going to give you three tips
[00:02:05] of what you should be listening to this summer.
[00:02:08] Okay, now, hi everyone, who am I?
[00:02:11] I'm Kim Rittberg, and that's R-I-T-T-P-E-R-G.
[00:02:15] So make sure to follow me on Instagram.
[00:02:16] And once you love this episode,
[00:02:18] I'll mention my Instagram.
[00:02:19] Again, at the end, so you don't forget,
[00:02:21] and we can connect and get to know each other.
[00:02:25] You know, I know real estate agents
[00:02:26] you're always working.
[00:02:27] Even when you're on vacation, you're still like,
[00:02:28] a little bit of you thinking about work.
[00:02:30] But the good news is, when you're on vacation,
[00:02:33] you can actually still be doing things
[00:02:34] that are helpful for your marketing of your business.
[00:02:37] A lot of times people forget
[00:02:38] there is an important component to social media.
[00:02:41] Even when you're making it for your business,
[00:02:43] there still should always be some element that is personal.
[00:02:46] And I, excuse me, I talked about this in my last video
[00:02:51] that maybe we can link out here is,
[00:02:55] there's two C's that are the key to really growing
[00:02:58] your social media.
[00:02:58] It's connection and credibility.
[00:03:00] You need those two C's in order for people
[00:03:03] to see you as likable and trustworthy,
[00:03:05] but also as someone that they should work with.
[00:03:08] So incredible.
[00:03:09] So the connection brings that likability
[00:03:11] and the credibility brings the trustworthiness.
[00:03:14] And then you're looking at partnerships, right?
[00:03:16] You're really looking at someone hiring you.
[00:03:18] So when we're talking about going on vacation,
[00:03:20] what can you be filming while you're on vacation?
[00:03:23] Oh, for us to introduce myself, I'm Kim Rittburg.
[00:03:25] I help real estate agents around the country film videos
[00:03:28] that grow their business.
[00:03:29] I help you figure out how to get on camera,
[00:03:31] get the confidence to be on camera,
[00:03:33] and actually learn what to film,
[00:03:35] and then put it out there,
[00:03:36] and then really build that social media content
[00:03:39] to bringing clients.
[00:03:40] I've had agents from around the country
[00:03:43] one just landed her third commission directly
[00:03:44] from social media.
[00:03:46] I've had others that are finally getting on camera
[00:03:48] for the first time.
[00:03:49] And now it's the fifth time.
[00:03:51] And now it's the tenth time.
[00:03:52] And they are telling me time and again,
[00:03:53] showing up on camera is bringing in clients.
[00:03:57] One of my clients, Brianne, who did a video bootcamp with me
[00:04:00] said, as soon as she started showing up on camera,
[00:04:03] an agent that had followed her,
[00:04:04] but she didn't know them, sent her a referral
[00:04:06] basically within that week.
[00:04:08] And so the more you're showing up,
[00:04:09] the more you're building that connection with people.
[00:04:11] So don't forget to show up.
[00:04:13] And that is what I'm here to do,
[00:04:16] is to help you show up more confident on camera
[00:04:18] and know what to make that grow as your business.
[00:04:21] So we're talking about vacation content.
[00:04:23] The two seasons connection and credibility connection
[00:04:25] is helping people like you and get to know you.
[00:04:27] Here's one thing you can film.
[00:04:30] Something beautiful where you're at.
[00:04:32] So that could be a beach, that could be a sunset,
[00:04:35] anything that you're like, oh my God, that geyser,
[00:04:38] that glacier, that, and you know,
[00:04:40] sometimes you're not on vacation,
[00:04:41] you're like just in your regular everyday life,
[00:04:43] look at your neighborhood with an outsider's lines.
[00:04:46] Google images your neighborhood, see what comes up,
[00:04:48] see the cutest, prettiest spots in your neighborhood
[00:04:50] and film that for yourself with your phone.
[00:04:53] You don't need more than your iPhone, by the way.
[00:04:56] Film a beach or a sunset or anything pretty,
[00:04:58] and how are you gonna use it?
[00:05:00] Right, so you're filming that content,
[00:05:01] so you're gonna stand there.
[00:05:03] Don't move a lot,
[00:05:04] because when you move, that's when people are like,
[00:05:05] and like get a little car sick from watching your video.
[00:05:09] Don't move a lot, don't worry about fancy panning
[00:05:11] and filmmaking moves,
[00:05:13] unless you have a good camera with like a good
[00:05:15] gimbal or a good steady cam, just film steady.
[00:05:18] And then how are you gonna use it?
[00:05:20] What are you gonna write about it?
[00:05:21] When you post it in the actual little caption area
[00:05:23] on the right side,
[00:05:25] you can connect that to two different ideas.
[00:05:28] One, it could be about work life balance.
[00:05:30] I think there's a lot of people out there,
[00:05:32] not I think I know.
[00:05:33] There's a lot of people out there
[00:05:34] who relate to the idea of really meeting that
[00:05:35] on winding time.
[00:05:36] We live in a grueling, you know, just a grueling world.
[00:05:41] We're always working and we're always grinding,
[00:05:42] and so it is important to take that time.
[00:05:45] And people will love to know that you,
[00:05:47] as a committed agent,
[00:05:48] also are committed to balancing.
[00:05:50] And so I wanna see that feature that,
[00:05:52] a feature of the sunset and the content
[00:05:54] connecting it to a win, a connecting it to balance.
[00:05:58] The other one you can connect it to is a win.
[00:06:00] So it could be like how it feels after working
[00:06:03] with a client for six months,
[00:06:04] and we finally close the deal,
[00:06:06] or like we finally saw in the contract,
[00:06:07] or you know, we're finally gave them the new keys.
[00:06:10] And it can be like,
[00:06:13] because we're talking about visual metaphors,
[00:06:15] so it could be like anything that feels like a win,
[00:06:18] maybe you're on the top of a mountain.
[00:06:20] Maybe like the sun just peeked out from the cloud.
[00:06:22] So something that feels like a win,
[00:06:24] I would just connect it with that.
[00:06:25] Again, this content does not need to be complicated.
[00:06:27] It could be one clip of video,
[00:06:29] and you put some words over it.
[00:06:30] It doesn't need to be some crazy video edited
[00:06:33] that's gonna take you four hours.
[00:06:34] It should not be that, it doesn't need to be that.
[00:06:37] Now all this content, you can save it.
[00:06:38] I recommend saving it an album,
[00:06:41] call it social media, call it video,
[00:06:43] call it B-roll footage,
[00:06:45] which is the fancy word for it,
[00:06:46] but make sure you're saving it into an album.
[00:06:48] Okay, the second part is you in the footage.
[00:06:51] So a lot of times we don't have ourself in the footage,
[00:06:53] which makes sense because you know,
[00:06:55] we don't necessarily have a camera crew following us,
[00:06:56] like celebrities, like Beyonce or Taylor Swift
[00:06:58] for their concert documentaries.
[00:07:00] We don't have people following us.
[00:07:02] So you have to be comfortable with asking your partner,
[00:07:05] your spouse, your friend, your kid, whoever.
[00:07:07] Hey, you have to say, hey, I'm starting to do more marketing.
[00:07:11] I'm gonna blame it on Kim Ritberg,
[00:07:12] my new virtual best friend, video coach.
[00:07:15] Kim Ritberg wants me to film some content
[00:07:17] on this vacation with me in it.
[00:07:19] Here's what I need you to do.
[00:07:21] And you're gonna ask them if you're on Instagram
[00:07:22] or TikTok, you want your video vertical,
[00:07:25] like hold your phone up vertically.
[00:07:27] You're gonna say, please film me here in this shot.
[00:07:31] Just film me for 10 seconds,
[00:07:33] and that's it, maybe 20 seconds.
[00:07:35] What you're gonna do in the shot,
[00:07:37] you can either turn your back to the camera
[00:07:39] and like look at the beach,
[00:07:41] and they can stand back and they can get you
[00:07:43] looking at the beach.
[00:07:44] They, you can be sitting there drinking like a cute little drink,
[00:07:48] a cocktail, a motel, whatever,
[00:07:50] but like not looking at the camera is the important part.
[00:07:54] So maybe the sunset or the beach
[00:07:56] or something beautiful and you're sitting there,
[00:07:58] and you're just like drinking your drinking thinking,
[00:08:00] and you're in part of the shot, but it's not just you.
[00:08:04] Another one is like you could do like,
[00:08:06] I've seen this footage and I like this
[00:08:07] is a little bit of cheers, like you could almost cheers the camera,
[00:08:10] like cheers to you being on vacation
[00:08:12] and actually enjoying it.
[00:08:14] The themes of these can also be that you're unwinding
[00:08:17] that you're taking it down.
[00:08:19] The other element is you can just be about what you love to do.
[00:08:23] Maybe you love to travel and you're visiting
[00:08:24] somewhere that you've never been before.
[00:08:26] So in terms of how you connect it, that can be up to you.
[00:08:29] But I do think it's really important
[00:08:30] to actually capture this video while you're on vacation.
[00:08:32] You of course can't get this again.
[00:08:34] And then just shoot it and then save it in an album.
[00:08:36] What I do is I have a folder called Instagram,
[00:08:38] ready for edit, and basically it just has footage that I take.
[00:08:42] And when I'm like, oh, this is a good,
[00:08:44] just like a nice shot.
[00:08:45] I'm gonna put this in that folder
[00:08:46] and you can always use it later
[00:08:48] and you can figure it out later,
[00:08:49] but you can't go back and film it later.
[00:08:51] So it's important to film it in the moment.
[00:08:54] I have that happened just in my normal life.
[00:08:55] Like I'll just go out, I live in New York City
[00:08:58] and sometimes I live near the Brooklyn Bridge.
[00:09:01] So I just see like a beautiful sunset
[00:09:02] passing over the bridge.
[00:09:03] I'm like, that's just a nice shot.
[00:09:06] And everyone's like, I'll go up to a really high rise,
[00:09:10] really tall high rise in New York City
[00:09:11] and the view is insane.
[00:09:13] And I can see the crystal building,
[00:09:15] the Empire State Building.
[00:09:15] I think I don't know what I'm gonna use this for right now,
[00:09:18] but I'm gonna take this footage.
[00:09:19] And then later when we talk about the visual metaphors,
[00:09:23] right, I'm gonna turn that into a visual metaphor.
[00:09:24] So if I'm really high up, I'm kind of on top of the world,
[00:09:28] that's maybe the content I'm gonna write.
[00:09:30] Maybe I would write, you know,
[00:09:34] just wrapped up my most recent video bootcamp.
[00:09:37] It was so amazing, I feel on top of the world.
[00:09:40] And maybe I'm gonna put that footage
[00:09:41] of me being really high up, literally being on top of the world.
[00:09:45] And that's a way to bring in my community
[00:09:47] and have people celebrate themselves
[00:09:49] for finishing my video bootcamp class.
[00:09:51] So when we're filming things, we're just thinking like,
[00:09:54] it's not always the exact thing you're doing.
[00:09:56] Like, I love eating pizza, here's me eating pizza.
[00:09:58] Or like, I love because the family,
[00:10:00] here's me being with my family.
[00:10:01] That's great, but sometimes we don't have that.
[00:10:03] And we need to speak in metaphors, right?
[00:10:04] Like, we had a hard day.
[00:10:07] Would you do when you feel really low?
[00:10:09] You might not have footage of like you laying in bed
[00:10:10] feeling sad, but you might be able to get footage
[00:10:12] of like a storm, or when it's rainy out, or when it's dark out.
[00:10:17] And so, you know, just start filming things
[00:10:19] that A are actually you in your real life,
[00:10:21] but also you could start filming those visual metaphors.
[00:10:23] Okay, the last thing I wanna recommend
[00:10:25] is you with your family.
[00:10:26] So, unless you have kids who don't wanna be in your footage,
[00:10:29] and then you cannot show their faces,
[00:10:31] but definitely film content of you with your family.
[00:10:33] People will really react and engage with content
[00:10:36] that is about you as a person,
[00:10:38] which I've been bringing that connection in.
[00:10:41] Most people you know know you as a whole person,
[00:10:42] not just as a realist Asian.
[00:10:44] Maybe you're a parent, maybe you're a dog owner,
[00:10:46] maybe you're elder, take care of your parent,
[00:10:48] whatever that situation is, bring them into your social content.
[00:10:51] It will really help people connect with you more.
[00:10:53] And so, capture that content while you have it.
[00:10:56] Now, you can let your family know,
[00:10:58] hey, Kim Rittburg is making me film this
[00:11:00] for social media marketing.
[00:11:02] Have somebody film you and your family.
[00:11:04] What could this look like?
[00:11:05] They can film you guys from the back.
[00:11:07] If you have little kids hold their hand
[00:11:09] and just walk down the street,
[00:11:10] walk down the boardwalk, walk on the beach, whatever.
[00:11:13] If they're fine with being filmed,
[00:11:15] you can have somebody sit there,
[00:11:16] and if you're like on the beach, like running into the waves,
[00:11:19] that's really fun.
[00:11:20] Maybe you're in the water, maybe you're in the pool,
[00:11:22] and you're like lifting your little kid.
[00:11:24] Again, just film that for like 10 to 20 seconds.
[00:11:27] All their family footage content.
[00:11:29] I try to think if you're on a boardwalk,
[00:11:31] just you guys walking, maybe you're ordering ice cream.
[00:11:34] Like anything that really looks fun
[00:11:36] and different than your normal content,
[00:11:37] think about your normal content, it's in houses.
[00:11:40] It's selling houses, it's about money,
[00:11:41] it's about homes, it's about numbers, it's about lawns.
[00:11:43] How do you get out of that visual world, right?
[00:11:45] Are you ordering ice cream?
[00:11:47] Are you picking out a surfboard?
[00:11:49] Are you just sitting on a beach chair, right?
[00:11:52] Just someone filming from the side
[00:11:54] without you looking at the camera,
[00:11:55] you and your family members on beach chairs,
[00:11:58] maybe just reading books and just film that for 10 to 20 seconds.
[00:12:01] Don't look at the camera, just do your regular thing,
[00:12:03] and you'll be able to connect it again
[00:12:05] with that concept of balance
[00:12:07] and the caption can be about,
[00:12:08] you know, so glad I'm getting some online time,
[00:12:10] quality time with my kids, my family.
[00:12:12] Okay, all right, I give you some good vacation content

Doing your summer break or break, or nobody really has breaks, but doing the summer. And no matter where you are, if you're on vacation, or if you're in the office, it's I'm going to give you three tips of what you should be filming this summer. So today I'm going to give you three tips of what you should be listening to this summer. Okay, now, hi everyone, who am I? I'm Kim Rittberg, and that's R-I-T-T-P-E-R-G. So make sure to follow me on Instagram. And once you love this episode, I'll mention my Instagram. Again, at the end, so you don't forget, and we can connect and get to know each other. You know, I know real estate agents you're always working. Even when you're on vacation, you're still like, a little bit of you thinking about work. But the good news is, when you're on vacation, you can actually still be doing things that are helpful for your marketing of your business. A lot of times people forget there is an important component to social media. Even when you're making it for your business, there still should always be some element that is personal. And I, excuse me, I talked about this in my last video that maybe we can link out here is, there's two C's that are the key to really growing your social media. It's connection and credibility. You need those two C's in order for people to see you as likable and trustworthy, but also as someone that they should work with. So incredible. So the connection brings that likability and the credibility brings the trustworthiness. And then you're looking at partnerships, right? You're really looking at someone hiring you. So when we're talking about going on vacation, what can you be filming while you're on vacation? Oh, for us to introduce myself, I'm Kim Rittburg. I help real estate agents around the country film videos that grow their business. I help you figure out how to get on camera, get the confidence to be on camera, and actually learn what to film, and then put it out there, and then really build that social media content to bringing clients. I've had agents from around the country one just landed her third commission directly from social media. I've had others that are finally getting on camera for the first time. And now it's the fifth time. And now it's the tenth time. And they are telling me time and again, showing up on camera is bringing in clients. One of my clients, Brianne, who did a video bootcamp with me said, as soon as she started showing up on camera, an agent that had followed her, but she didn't know them, sent her a referral basically within that week. And so the more you're showing up, the more you're building that connection with people. So don't forget to show up. And that is what I'm here to do, is to help you show up more confident on camera and know what to make that grow as your business. So we're talking about vacation content. The two seasons connection and credibility connection is helping people like you and get to know you. Here's one thing you can film. Something beautiful where you're at. So that could be a beach, that could be a sunset, anything that you're like, oh my God, that geyser, that glacier, that, and you know, sometimes you're not on vacation, you're like just in your regular everyday life, look at your neighborhood with an outsider's lines. Google images your neighborhood, see what comes up, see the cutest, prettiest spots in your neighborhood and film that for yourself with your phone. You don't need more than your iPhone, by the way. Film a beach or a sunset or anything pretty, and how are you gonna use it? Right, so you're filming that content, so you're gonna stand there. Don't move a lot, because when you move, that's when people are like, and like get a little car sick from watching your video. Don't move a lot, don't worry about fancy panning and filmmaking moves, unless you have a good camera with like a good gimbal or a good steady cam, just film steady. And then how are you gonna use it? What are you gonna write about it? When you post it in the actual little caption area on the right side, you can connect that to two different ideas. One, it could be about work life balance. I think there's a lot of people out there, not I think I know. There's a lot of people out there who relate to the idea of really meeting that on winding time. We live in a grueling, you know, just a grueling world. We're always working and we're always grinding, and so it is important to take that time. And people will love to know that you, as a committed agent, also are committed to balancing. And so I wanna see that feature that, a feature of the sunset and the content connecting it to a win, a connecting it to balance. The other one you can connect it to is a win. So it could be like how it feels after working with a client for six months, and we finally close the deal, or like we finally saw in the contract, or you know, we're finally gave them the new keys. And it can be like, because we're talking about visual metaphors, so it could be like anything that feels like a win, maybe you're on the top of a mountain. Maybe like the sun just peeked out from the cloud. So something that feels like a win, I would just connect it with that. Again, this content does not need to be complicated. It could be one clip of video, and you put some words over it. It doesn't need to be some crazy video edited that's gonna take you four hours. It should not be that, it doesn't need to be that. Now all this content, you can save it. I recommend saving it an album, call it social media, call it video, call it B-roll footage, which is the fancy word for it, but make sure you're saving it into an album. Okay, the second part is you in the footage. So a lot of times we don't have ourself in the footage, which makes sense because you know, we don't necessarily have a camera crew following us, like celebrities, like Beyonce or Taylor Swift for their concert documentaries. We don't have people following us. So you have to be comfortable with asking your partner, your spouse, your friend, your kid, whoever. Hey, you have to say, hey, I'm starting to do more marketing. I'm gonna blame it on Kim Ritberg, my new virtual best friend, video coach. Kim Ritberg wants me to film some content on this vacation with me in it. Here's what I need you to do. And you're gonna ask them if you're on Instagram or TikTok, you want your video vertical, like hold your phone up vertically. You're gonna say, please film me here in this shot. Just film me for 10 seconds, and that's it, maybe 20 seconds. What you're gonna do in the shot, you can either turn your back to the camera and like look at the beach, and they can stand back and they can get you looking at the beach. They, you can be sitting there drinking like a cute little drink, a cocktail, a motel, whatever, but like not looking at the camera is the important part. So maybe the sunset or the beach or something beautiful and you're sitting there, and you're just like drinking your drinking thinking, and you're in part of the shot, but it's not just you. Another one is like you could do like, I've seen this footage and I like this is a little bit of cheers, like you could almost cheers the camera, like cheers to you being on vacation and actually enjoying it. The themes of these can also be that you're unwinding that you're taking it down. The other element is you can just be about what you love to do. Maybe you love to travel and you're visiting somewhere that you've never been before. So in terms of how you connect it, that can be up to you. But I do think it's really important to actually capture this video while you're on vacation. You of course can't get this again. And then just shoot it and then save it in an album. What I do is I have a folder called Instagram, ready for edit, and basically it just has footage that I take. And when I'm like, oh, this is a good, just like a nice shot. I'm gonna put this in that folder and you can always use it later and you can figure it out later, but you can't go back and film it later. So it's important to film it in the moment. I have that happened just in my normal life. Like I'll just go out, I live in New York City and sometimes I live near the Brooklyn Bridge. So I just see like a beautiful sunset passing over the bridge. I'm like, that's just a nice shot. And everyone's like, I'll go up to a really high rise, really tall high rise in New York City and the view is insane. And I can see the crystal building, the Empire State Building. I think I don't know what I'm gonna use this for right now, but I'm gonna take this footage. And then later when we talk about the visual metaphors, right, I'm gonna turn that into a visual metaphor. So if I'm really high up, I'm kind of on top of the world, that's maybe the content I'm gonna write. Maybe I would write, you know, just wrapped up my most recent video bootcamp. It was so amazing, I feel on top of the world. And maybe I'm gonna put that footage of me being really high up, literally being on top of the world. And that's a way to bring in my community and have people celebrate themselves for finishing my video bootcamp class. So when we're filming things, we're just thinking like, it's not always the exact thing you're doing. Like, I love eating pizza, here's me eating pizza. Or like, I love because the family, here's me being with my family. That's great, but sometimes we don't have that. And we need to speak in metaphors, right? Like, we had a hard day. Would you do when you feel really low? You might not have footage of like you laying in bed feeling sad, but you might be able to get footage of like a storm, or when it's rainy out, or when it's dark out. And so, you know, just start filming things that A are actually you in your real life, but also you could start filming those visual metaphors. Okay, the last thing I wanna recommend is you with your family. So, unless you have kids who don't wanna be in your footage, and then you cannot show their faces, but definitely film content of you with your family. People will really react and engage with content that is about you as a person, which I've been bringing that connection in. Most people you know know you as a whole person, not just as a realist Asian. Maybe you're a parent, maybe you're a dog owner, maybe you're elder, take care of your parent, whatever that situation is, bring them into your social content. It will really help people connect with you more. And so, capture that content while you have it. Now, you can let your family know, hey, Kim Rittburg is making me film this for social media marketing. Have somebody film you and your family. What could this look like? They can film you guys from the back. If you have little kids hold their hand and just walk down the street, walk down the boardwalk, walk on the beach, whatever. If they're fine with being filmed, you can have somebody sit there, and if you're like on the beach, like running into the waves, that's really fun. Maybe you're in the water, maybe you're in the pool, and you're like lifting your little kid. Again, just film that for like 10 to 20 seconds. All their family footage content. I try to think if you're on a boardwalk, just you guys walking, maybe you're ordering ice cream. Like anything that really looks fun and different than your normal content, think about your normal content, it's in houses. It's selling houses, it's about money, it's about homes, it's about numbers, it's about lawns. How do you get out of that visual world, right? Are you ordering ice cream? Are you picking out a surfboard? Are you just sitting on a beach chair, right? Just someone filming from the side without you looking at the camera, you and your family members on beach chairs, maybe just reading books and just film that for 10 to 20 seconds. Don't look at the camera, just do your regular thing, and you'll be able to connect it again with that concept of balance and the caption can be about, you know, so glad I'm getting some online time, quality time with my kids, my family.
