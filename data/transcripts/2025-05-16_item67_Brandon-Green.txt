[00:01:18] Today's episode is brought to you by corded.io.
[00:01:21] Are you looking for agents to join your brokerage or team?
[00:01:25] Now, as a real estate recruiter, I can tell you the answer is always yes.
[00:01:29] But most agents aren't looking to move right now.
[00:01:32] So how do you know who to contact?
[00:01:34] Well, what if I were to tell you there's a recruiting and retention tool powered
[00:01:38] by artificial intelligence that shows you exactly which agents in your local
[00:01:42] market are looking to leave their brokerage right now and which agents at your
[00:01:47] own firm are also looking to leave you.
[00:01:50] Now, I've been recruiting REALTORS for 15 years and I've hired over 2,000
[00:01:54] agents.
[00:01:55] I can tell you with no exaggeration.
[00:01:58] This is the tool I've been waiting for.
[00:01:59] Corded's AI looks for trends across dozens of variables for each agent in your
[00:02:04] market and shows you which agents they believe are likely to move.
[00:02:08] Not only does it do that, but corded's AI went and visited my recruiting
[00:02:12] website and read everything I offer.
[00:02:14] So now when I'm recruiting, corded's AI tells me exactly what to say based on
[00:02:19] that agent's needs and what my brokerage can offer.
[00:02:22] It even writes emails for me.
[00:02:24] I've never seen anything like it and I use it every single day.
[00:02:28] Now, if you are looking to grow your brokerage, corded.io is the best tool out
[00:02:33] there.

[00:03:39] Our sponsors are amazing.
[00:03:40] All right, guys, let's get to it.
[00:03:42] My conversation with Brandon Green.
[00:03:57] What is the best piece of advice you have ever received in real estate?
[00:04:04] DJ, the best piece of advice I got was from a real estate team owner
[00:04:13] who had sold his team about two years into me being a brand new agent.
[00:04:18] And I really looked up to him.
[00:04:20] I was like, how'd you do it?
[00:04:21] Right?
[00:04:22] You know, 30-year-instance success guy.
[00:04:24] And I remember he said, Brandon, you as soon as possible need to begin to treat
[00:04:30] your business like a business.
[00:04:34] And even if you never sell your real estate business, start today thinking as if
[00:04:41] you would.
[00:04:42] And that was such great foundational advice for me, you're two.
[00:04:46] Right?
[00:04:47] I didn't contextualize that for sure, but it made me think about my business
[00:04:52] immediately different than I think I probably would have otherwise.
[00:04:56] It's wonderful.
[00:04:58] And on the flip side, what's the worst piece of advice you've ever received in real estate?
[00:05:03] I remember this agent in the office.
[00:05:05] He was like 85, still showing houses on the Saturday.
[00:05:09] Right?
[00:05:10] Had a bit of a raspy voice.
[00:05:11] It was bitter.
[00:05:12] She couldn't go to brunch.
[00:05:14] And she's like, you just need to sell another house, sell another house,
[00:05:19] sell it on her house.
[00:05:20] And it's all going to work out.
[00:05:21] I remember that she had that like voice to it.
[00:05:24] And I remember thinking, maybe I mean, I could, you know, short term that's really
[00:05:31] helpful.
[00:05:32] Sure.
[00:05:32] It's not the long term game.
[00:05:34] Yeah, maybe there's more.
[00:05:36] Yeah.
[00:05:36] Maybe there's more to it.
[00:05:37] I don't know that I want to be, you know, bitter about not going to brunch and instead
[00:05:42] doing an open house, you know, when I get well into my later years.
[00:05:48] Right.
[00:05:48] So that was an interesting conversation.
[00:05:51] I remember having with her one Saturday morning as she was hauling her signs to her
[00:05:57] open house.
[00:05:58] And I was in the office working out of contract.
[00:06:00] Sort of sounds like the opposite of freedom to an example.
[00:06:05] That we all don't need to do the work and and sell that next house.
[00:06:09] But if maybe if that's the only sort of way you see as a path forward that that
[00:06:14] certainly can feel defeating, I suppose once you're, you know,
[00:06:18] slogging around signs when you're, you know, older and maybe wish to not do that as
[00:06:23] much.
[00:06:24] So well, Brandon Green is our our guest today on the episode on this episode.
[00:06:30] We are so excited.
[00:06:31] He is from Alchemy of Money.
[00:06:33] We're going to tell you more about his company Alchemy of Money.
[00:06:37] He's got CEO is where you can go to learn about it.
[00:06:39] We will have a link to that in our show notes.
[00:06:41] Well, let me tell you about a bar Brandon.
[00:06:43] Brandon Green was born in Southwest Wyoming.
[00:06:45] So he's the first person you probably know from Wyoming.
[00:06:48] Well, not anymore.
[00:06:49] People are not flocking to Wyoming.
[00:06:50] But certainly that wasn't always the case.
[00:06:54] And but he grew up in Iowa, which is right next door to where I live in Chicago.
[00:06:59] And in 1999 moved to Washington, DC with no money, no prospects, no college degree.
[00:07:04] Luckily, he had a knack for sales went into real estate, 2001.
[00:07:08] Today, he's an award winning entrepreneur and investor committed to helping other real estate
[00:07:12] entrepreneurs reach financial freedom quicker and with more ease in 2022.
[00:07:17] Brandon launched his newest venture Alchemy of Money, Inc.
[00:07:20] A tech enabled financial services company providing bookkeeping,
[00:07:24] tech strategy and filing fractional CFO services, financial coaching and investments
[00:07:29] exclusively for real estate professionals.
[00:07:31] I will break into this for just a quick moment to say, consider getting yourself a CFO for your business.
[00:07:38] That's called a fractional CFO.
[00:07:40] If you aren't, you know, you're, you know, this massive corporation,
[00:07:43] you can actually do that with Brandon's help.
[00:07:45] We'll tell you more about that in a bit, but you might know Brandon from his time,
[00:07:48] co-founding and leading Keller Williams capital properties in our nation's capital.
[00:07:53] Under his leadership, it was named best employer by the Washington Post and grew to be among the top 0.2%
[00:07:59] of all brokerages nationwide with seven locations and over a thousand REALTORS.
[00:08:04] Brandon has been featured by the Washington Post Wall Street Journal,
[00:08:06] Fortune Magazine called into support RE/MAX, Coldwell Banker, Compass,
[00:08:11] eXp, South of Bees, Berkshire Hathaway and Long and Foster.
[00:08:14] You know those names.
[00:08:15] These are the companies that call Brandon and we are grateful to have him on our show today
[00:08:20] for a little bit of time. Alchemyofmoney.co is where you go to learn about Brandon and Brandon.
[00:08:27] I'm so sorry, please give your Instagram.
[00:08:30] Brandon Green now.
[00:08:31] Brandon Green now will have a link to both of those in our show.
[00:08:34] Brandon, welcome.
[00:08:35] Thanks, DJ. Glad to be here.
[00:08:38] Very excited to have you.
[00:08:39] You have been in this industry 25 years and very, you've done a lot of really impressive,
[00:08:45] really impressive things as a bit of a better word, lots of different things.
[00:08:51] And you know, it's funny. We asked Brandon ahead of time.
[00:08:53] What do you want to talk about because you have so much knowledge and so much wisdom.
[00:08:56] He said, you know, I see agents helping people all day long with buying and selling property
[00:09:03] and whether they're primary residents, investors, whatever.
[00:09:06] And he says, I don't see them helping themselves as much as I'd like to.
[00:09:09] And I thought, boy, that's a great reminder.
[00:09:12] Even for me too, I'm in this business.
[00:09:14] How often am I helping myself in that particular journey?
[00:09:17] Not as much as I should.
[00:09:18] So we're bringing on Brandon's data.
[00:09:19] Talk more about that.
[00:09:21] And Brandon, let's get all the way back started in 2001 when you moved.
[00:09:25] Yeah.
[00:09:26] You know, from, I guess from Iowa all the way to DC, by the way, I just went to my very first Iowa football game.
[00:09:34] Last, last year, my girlfriend's family.
[00:09:38] A lot of them are in Iowa and we got to see, we had some tickets that were not being used that week.
[00:09:43] And I got to see that, that type of football game, which was really great.
[00:09:47] And I got to see the, what they call the greatest, the greatest, oh gosh, I'm blanking on the word.
[00:09:53] But, but the greatest sort of ritual in college football where there's a, there was a children's ward of a hospital.
[00:09:59] I believe it's a cancer ward and it overlooks the stadium and Apple.
[00:10:03] Order.
[00:10:04] Yeah, everybody including the players on both sides and all everyone in the stadium turns and waves towards the children.
[00:10:09] And boy, that was a moment to behold.
[00:10:11] So if you, anyone ever gets a chance to go to an Iowa football game, boy, that is, that is something you will not forget.
[00:10:17] But anyway, you moved to DC.
[00:10:18] So tell us, tell us about that.
[00:10:20] Yeah, I did. I moved to DC.
[00:10:22] Just looking for some opportunity, wanted to get in a big city to really have, particularly any plans.
[00:10:27] And then probably go to school here.
[00:10:29] I had graduated from high school in Iowa and then went on the road touring with an international
[00:10:34] musical organization singing and dancing.
[00:10:36] And that was a great time.
[00:10:38] And at some point after doing that for a couple of years, I was like, either I need to pursue
[00:10:41] forming arts full time.
[00:10:43] Or I need to figure out something else and
[00:10:47] decided something else was my option.
[00:10:48] So yeah, landed in, in the area doing a cold calling for staffing firm.
[00:10:53] That was my first job.
[00:10:55] So my job was to find a list of companies, cold call them and see if they'd be interested in hiring us to help them recruit for their open positions.
[00:11:04] And you know, traditional sales back,
[00:11:06] environment, you know, ring a bell when you make a sale, do a hundred cold calls a day.
[00:11:10] You got to take five people to lunch, close three deals, t t t t t t.
[00:11:14] And honestly, I really liked it.
[00:11:16] I liked the energy around it.
[00:11:18] I liked the fact I could see a direct correlation between my efforts and my income.
[00:11:23] It didn't have a lot of meaningfulness to it.
[00:11:26] And so, you know, after a couple of years, I was like, maybe there's something else here.
[00:11:29] And so late one night, I was watching a Carlton Sheetz infomercial.
[00:11:33] Now, I don't know how long he's been doing this 60 years.
[00:11:39] And one of the, one of the first guys to really do a lot on television about about real estate and fasting in particular.
[00:11:45] He was your early in marketing influencer, right, with how he was.
[00:11:50] Yeah, he was.
[00:11:51] Yeah, he was.
[00:11:53] And he may have been the first true real estate investor influencer.
[00:11:57] That's right.
[00:11:58] Yeah, it's true.
[00:11:59] And you know, and I bought his course, right?
[00:12:01] This was now in the early 2000s.
[00:12:03] It was like, you know, mail it to your house and so forth.
[00:12:07] And I remember thinking DJ like, okay, yeah, there's probably more to it than rich and be on a beach with the martini
[00:12:15] 90 days.
[00:12:16] But it did inspire me to say, well, how can I do this?
[00:12:19] And how can I get into the real estate game myself?
[00:12:21] So I bought my first investment property using an FHA 203K renovation loan, which you're not supposed to use for investment properties.
[00:12:30] I don't know, we recording this.
[00:12:32] But I bought it and I sold that property, made some money and I thought, out.
[00:12:38] Maybe this is my jam.
[00:12:39] So that's what got me into real estate was really aspiring for something bigger for myself than, you know, relentless coal calling forever.
[00:12:49] And I liked the intersection of people income, possibility.
[00:12:55] And I really liked old houses and real estate and renovating them.
[00:12:58] So that was the beginning.
[00:13:01] Yeah.
[00:13:01] And how did that proceed from there?
[00:13:03] Did you go sort of fully into the investor side or were you still?
[00:13:09] Both doing traditional real estate brokerage, helping public with their primary residences or was it just investor full steam?
[00:13:17] First as an investor, I quickly realized, well, I could buy one with the W2 income I had from my other job.
[00:13:26] But that was it that I needed to come up with another way to make money.
[00:13:29] So I quit the W2 job in full time in the sales.
[00:13:34] I could see that I could use my income from my sales business to purchase more real estate.
[00:13:40] Yeah.
[00:13:41] So I applied the coal calling skills that I'd learned in the other environment to real estate sales and door knocking.
[00:13:47] So I just started going to grid it out in neighborhood and I was like, well, there's got to be some sort of ratio here of X number of doors, why number of people answer them, Z number of people and bite me in and a converts B signs up for.
[00:14:00] So I just applied those tried and true sales principles I learned in the other shop over to real estate and I quickly learned like nobody works at hard in real estate.
[00:14:09] It's like nobody is door knocking 100 doors a day like.
[00:14:13] Well, if I do that, then I could really take off.
[00:14:18] So I sold 12 million that first year, 20 million in real estate the second year.
[00:14:22] I'd deploying literally night and day, rain snow, whatever door knocking and then hosting open houses for more senior agents in the office who didn't want to do it anymore.
[00:14:33] In order to fund my real estate investment business and my personal lifestyle, right? I have no other income.
[00:14:40] Sure.
[00:14:40] So that's what like push push me into the industry fully as both an investor and a practitioner and sales.
[00:14:46] I love that you took the money that you earned in sort of the traditional side of it and decided to reinvest it into a different side of it, which would ideally basically funding you could say funding retirement, you could say funding, you know, a cash flow,
[00:15:02] current cash flow lifestyle, you know, some nice tax benefits along the way as well.
[00:15:06] And yeah, I know a lot of guys who affects this happens a lot.
[00:15:11] I think on the lending side.
[00:15:12] So you know, people who are around loans all day a lot of times are going wait a minute.
[00:15:17] Why am I not doing more?
[00:15:19] You know, I own maybe I own my own condo or where I live.
[00:15:22] But I'm seeing all these other people get loans and you know work on the on the cash flow side.
[00:15:27] And boy, it seems very enticing, but I don't see as many REALTORS taking advantage of that.
[00:15:32] So let's I think let's dive into what are some of the challenges or where the where some of the roadblocks that REALTORS
[00:15:41] you know, maybe they're not thinking about doing this.
[00:15:44] Maybe they're feeling like they don't have the income to do it.
[00:15:46] Yep.
[00:15:47] And or maybe they're thinking, you know, gosh, I have to fund my own individual set by array or I have to, you know,
[00:15:54] contribute to other expenses and they're not setting aside money.
[00:15:57] Maybe to do this.
[00:15:58] So I'd love to talk about where you see agents kind of first kind of going wrong or not necessarily going wrong,
[00:16:03] but just not exploring this as an opportunity.
[00:16:06] So first, if they already know intellectually it's an opportunity and I think most do sure then either
[00:16:14] they're not truly being honest with themselves about the amount of time that's necessary to run two businesses because that's what it is.
[00:16:20] It's two businesses.
[00:16:21] It's an investment business and it's a sales business.
[00:16:23] So that's 80 hours a week.
[00:16:25] Let's call it is, right?
[00:16:26] So they're not giving it the time it needs to actually get one of the other up and running for a lot of legitimate reasons.
[00:16:31] It's could have family other obligations, whatever.
[00:16:33] When I did it, look, I had no family.
[00:16:36] I had no friends.
[00:16:36] I had no family.
[00:16:37] There's nothing else going on in my life.
[00:16:39] So I put all I had into it.
[00:16:41] So I think you've got to organize your life in such a way that you can go all in on something for a period of time at the consequence of something else.
[00:16:49] Sure.
[00:16:49] And most people don't want to make that trade off.
[00:16:51] Yeah.
[00:16:52] But that's the truth of it.
[00:16:53] But if they do, there's yet another issue and that is taxes.
[00:16:58] And I remember quickly realizing that while I was getting ahead on my income and I was acquiring more assets, I was getting behind on my taxes because I was using all my income to purchase real estate and the fund.
[00:17:16] What was a growing lifestyle?
[00:17:18] Let's be honest.
[00:17:19] Sure.
[00:17:19] I like to have fun.
[00:17:21] I like to spend the money.
[00:17:22] So that was like increasing.
[00:17:24] And a lot of the tax benefits around real estate don't kick in immediately.
[00:17:28] They come over time.
[00:17:30] And so I found myself with the third leg of this stool going, Uncle Sam saying, Hey, I appreciate the fact you've taken all your active cashflow and invested in real estate and taken some wild trips.
[00:17:42] But what about me?
[00:17:44] And so I got in a hole with the IRS early on, like by half a million dollars.
[00:17:48] And it was very embarrassing, DJ, very painful, very hard to deal with.
[00:17:54] I can now see, you know, a couple decades later, that that is a huge hindrance for people executing the game was not figuring out that third component.
[00:18:04] The third partner at the table, if you will, who is requiring renumeration and how to do that and still fund your business, fund your lifestyle and fund investments.
[00:18:16] Well, it's certainly a, yeah, stand the feeling like you should have done it because of course we always feel that way about mistakes or at least it's a natural way to think we should have should have done better.
[00:18:28] And at the same time, you know, we think, what was he doing with that money?
[00:18:31] He was actually funding his business and he was actually using it for a greater good.
[00:18:36] It wasn't, you know, entirely going to your own personal enjoyment.
[00:18:40] And so it's, it's something that, you know, we, we have to, it's easy to forget about that third partner, I suspect because of course, REALTOR is when they get paid.
[00:18:49] They don't necessarily those taxes aren't taken out right away.
[00:18:52] Maybe, you know, if they're disciplined, they have it automatically going to somewhere else where they can't see it for a while and just sort of under almost like lock and key.
[00:19:00] But if they're like most of us, we see that big amount hit our bank and we don't think I should probably put a third of that somewhere else because of course nobody wants to think that way.
[00:19:08] I don't want to think that we might think about it, but we don't actually do it right in.
[00:19:14] I mean, actually, I didn't even think about it honestly.
[00:19:15] The first three years I got in the business, it was year three DJ where I was like, wait a minute, I think I need to file taxes.
[00:19:24] Right.
[00:19:25] Because I was, I had all sales training.
[00:19:28] I was learning about being a real estate investor, but nobody, like I wasn't being trained.
[00:19:32] I wasn't seeking it out. I'm sure it was available.
[00:19:34] But I wasn't seeking out business training, how to run a prop and a law statement and manage cash flow.
[00:19:41] And I wasn't interested in that.
[00:19:43] I was interested in selling houses, helping people buying real estate grow, grow, grow.
[00:19:49] And the rest is going to figure itself out.
[00:19:51] And I hit a real wall in realized, oh, shoot, right there.
[00:19:56] No, yeah.
[00:19:57] No, you can get pretty far with that energy.
[00:19:59] But you can't probably accomplish ultimately what you want because you end up hitting some sort of wall I headed.
[00:20:07] Right. Yeah.
[00:20:08] At some point, there's, you know, this, this, this, you know, it's this three-legged stool that that third leg is not there.
[00:20:15] And it's getting wobbly and all of a sudden now we have, it's the most important leg of the stool because it's, it's affecting everything else.
[00:20:23] And again, certainly a relatable topic for a lot of us.
[00:20:27] I think all of us have, especially when, you know, we're being paid the full full amount from our commissions, you know, right to our bank account.
[00:20:35] It is so easy to not have a disciplined approach to, to putting that money in, in sort of buckets.
[00:20:42] And I, I've, I've fall prey to that myself.
[00:20:45] It's not something that I think anybody cannot relate to.
[00:20:49] So, I think you probably just certainly connected with a lot of, a lot of people on, on the call.
[00:20:53] And then there's the issue of education.
[00:20:56] We, we started to think about, okay, well, what, you know, aside from just moving a half, I don't know, third of it somewhere else, you know, letting it sit in a money market, you know, which is fine.
[00:21:05] But there are other options as well.
[00:21:07] And, you know, there's ways to maybe reduce that amount that you have to pay.
[00:21:11] And there are strategies that are, you know, they're put that are, they are afforded to us under the tax code.
[00:21:19] That is not about, you know, trying to, you know, pull a fast one on the government, but actually to take advantage in a positive way of what the government allows us to do.
[00:21:32] And what the government really sort of encourages us to do in order to fund, you know, small businesses are the backbone of this country.
[00:21:40] We're talking small business.
[00:21:41] And this is, you know, a lot of times small businesses don't have this understanding.
[00:21:45] You know, you're, they're doing all putting on all the hats, you're in charge of growth, you're in charge of health service, you're in charge of clients.
[00:21:54] And, you know, all of a sudden you have this, why don't I have somebody sort of reminding you to do these things because we can't do everything.
[00:22:02] So, let's talk about that.
[00:22:03] So, so what do you usually recommend to the agents as a way to get started to think about managing their finances?
[00:22:10] Yeah, yeah.
[00:22:11] So I remember having this conversation with my financial mentor as I was trying to figure out how to get out of this $500,000 whole, right.
[00:22:19] He's like, well, he said just what you said, right?
[00:22:21] Well, while as a business owner, as an asset owner, you have all these tax strategies you can deploy in order to significantly reduce your tax rate.
[00:22:28] And I was like, well, sign me up like let's do it.
[00:22:30] It goes, yeah, here's the problem.
[00:22:33] You don't have any underlying data to actually organize into the strategies.
[00:22:37] You don't have a proper and lasting.
[00:22:40] You're not tracking your expenses by category.
[00:22:43] You don't have any reconciled bank statement.
[00:22:45] There's nothing I can do for you because you don't have any of the data.
[00:22:48] And I was like, oh, right.
[00:22:50] So that sent me down a three year journey.
[00:22:53] And so when I would say to that DJ for anybody who's listening that might resonate with this situation is most people need to start with better data.
[00:23:00] And the data takes the form of good bookkeeping
[00:23:04] and an accurate statement of income and expenses reconciled monthly
[00:23:10] that shows actually what you've got going on.
[00:23:13] So you can take it to professional, whether it's an alchemy or somewhere else, and saying, here's actually what I'm doing in report format.
[00:23:20] What strategies are available to me?
[00:23:22] So we like to skip to the strategies.
[00:23:24] Like, sign me up for saving $8.00 on my taxes.
[00:23:28] But the data has to be in a way that that can be done.
[00:23:33] And then the other thing I learned that is sort of a cousin to that is the IRS has this like this or that it's never all or both.
[00:23:44] So for example, a strategy that many people probably know about is some form of retirement funding to reduce your tax liability 401k or an IRA.
[00:23:54] So the tax code essentially says, hey, you can fund your future and we'll give you tax benefit.
[00:23:59] But you actually have to put the cash in the account.
[00:24:02] So you either pay it to us, Uncle Sam, or you pay it to yourself, but you still have to pay it, which means you still have to have the cash to do it.
[00:24:13] You can't have spent it elsewhere.
[00:24:16] So getting to a place where you have the cash and have the data to deploy the strategies to reduce the overall amount you're paying in taxes.
[00:24:26] You're still going to outlay more or less the same amount of cash.
[00:24:30] Sure.
[00:24:30] Which you're going to outlay it to yourself versus the IRS.
[00:24:33] I think that's a little bit less understood.
[00:24:35] People are like, well, it's just going to be less cash out the door to anybody.
[00:24:39] Right.
[00:24:40] And it's actually no, no, no, it's less cash to the IRS and more to yourself via investments.
[00:24:48] Right.
[00:24:49] It's still money that has to be invested, which means you still have to have it, which means you still need to run your business well and profit.
[00:24:56] So you're going to have to have the cash to do those strategies.
[00:24:59] That's a really important distinction.
[00:25:01] I think that's a nuance that I'm glad you mentioned, which is this.
[00:25:04] Yes, you are if done properly in your in a certain category of income for your business, where you can reduce some of that tax liability.
[00:25:14] It becomes really easy to see that savings as just extra income that I get to because I own the company.
[00:25:21] I get access to.
[00:25:22] And yes, I guess technically that's true to a degree.
[00:25:26] Yes, you do have access to that.
[00:25:27] And yes, you can do what you wish with that or you could do what other responsible businesses do and think about.
[00:25:33] How do we use this to continue to keep the company solvent?
[00:25:36] How do we use this to keep maybe grow my company?
[00:25:39] And how do we just do the responsible thing?
[00:25:42] Which of course is what a CFO's job is is to make sure that a company is doing all of the right moves.
[00:25:49] Financial for the future.
[00:25:50] It's like what's that show that he's like, but it's a write off and he's like demon.
[00:25:56] But a write off you have to have the cat.
[00:25:58] What is that shits Creek or something?
[00:25:59] Yeah, well, I just I just write it off.
[00:26:02] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:26:03] No.
[00:26:08] You might get you might get 30% 35% of it back possibly.
[00:26:13] But but you're still yeah, it's yeah, I thought that too.
[00:26:16] When I when I first started a business started my own business.
[00:26:19] I was like, wait, what exactly is the right off?
[00:26:21] Does it what does it mean?
[00:26:22] And I and I did I had that thought that oh, like, oh, I don't have to pay for this.
[00:26:26] It's somehow it's free.
[00:26:28] And when that be nice.
[00:26:31] So so yeah, so tell us about Alchemy of money.
[00:26:34] Yeah, so all that experience.
[00:26:38] Many years later, informed my real passion around this topic.
[00:26:44] And that passion led to forming a company to help other people go through the
[00:26:51] journey, hopefully more successfully faster than I did around their finances.
[00:26:55] So today we help real estate entrepreneurs around the country with their
[00:27:00] bookkeeping like getting the data, the production of profit loss reports and
[00:27:03] balance sheets and understanding and interpreting what the data is telling you.
[00:27:06] And then with their taxes, either tax strategy or tax issues or just tax filing,
[00:27:11] whatever somebody actually needs.
[00:27:14] So we're running the back in finance of agents and teams all around the country.
[00:27:19] And it's been really exciting to do that.
[00:27:22] And so ironic DJ like the biggest, like personally, like some of the biggest
[00:27:27] problems I had early in my career, I know what a company actually help make people do it.
[00:27:31] I find I met with the mentor that same mentor I was actually telling you about a moment ago.
[00:27:36] I met with him for a lunch about three weeks ago.
[00:27:39] And he leans over the table when he goes, isn't it funny that you own an accounting
[00:27:44] firm?
[00:27:46] I was like, he's like, I never had that on my bingo card for you 20 years ago.
[00:27:52] I'm like, I'm not a bingo card for myself.
[00:27:54] Right.
[00:27:54] So that's what we're doing DJ is we're saying, look, we know agents.
[00:27:58] I've been, like, there's nobody knows agents.
[00:28:00] We know the issues.
[00:28:02] We know the opportunities and we know people like to keep those.
[00:28:04] I love that.
[00:28:05] So let's talk about some of the services, Yopper.
[00:28:07] Yeah.
[00:28:08] So the first one is the generation of a profit and loss statement.
[00:28:13] And let's pull all of your income expenses together and create a report that tells you
[00:28:17] how much money you're really making.
[00:28:19] You know, it's a lot of people manage their finance through their bank app.
[00:28:24] I have cash.
[00:28:25] I don't have cash.
[00:28:27] That is completely irrelevant in terms of whether you have profit and how much tax
[00:28:32] you owe, whether you're running your business well or not.
[00:28:35] You know, it's no secret.
[00:28:37] The market's been tough for a while continues to be it is not really feasible for most people to just we need and be successful year after year.
[00:28:47] Everybody eventually comes to the same conclusion in their business that they stay long enough, which is I need a profit and loss statement.
[00:28:54] So that's one big core business is the production and interpretation of that.
[00:29:00] So it's not just here's your data, but it's also saying, for example, DJ, okay.
[00:29:04] You're spending 14.5% of your gross commission income on lead generation conversion.
[00:29:09] The model for a business of your size is 9.5%.
[00:29:13] Right.
[00:29:14] So, so what are you doing with that extra is that needed what's your return on investment on that?
[00:29:19] Oh, and by the way, you're you're paying 5% more of your gross towards compensation and employees than the model.
[00:29:27] Is that working or is that not working for you?
[00:29:29] Like, let's have a real discussion around that.
[00:29:31] So it is back to that first really important good piece of advice I got early on, which was treat my business like a business.
[00:29:38] This is how you do that is through a P and L.
[00:29:41] So that's one big service is through the bookkeeping side.
[00:29:45] You know, that is that is such a really important P and L.
[00:29:49] It's funny. We've talked to other.
[00:29:51] You know, sort of tax specialists on the show over the years, they don't really talk profit and loss as much as we're doing now.
[00:29:58] Not that they don't I'm sure wish for everyone to have one because I'm sure they do we just don't have and talked about it.
[00:30:04] So I appreciate this conversation because again, a lot of us do have accounts and we think, okay, well, I've got a count.
[00:30:10] And I do have a corporation set up.
[00:30:12] So I'm paying myself sort of understand I'm doing something with pass through income and that's, you know, good for me with tax liability.
[00:30:20] But do I really understand my expenditures?
[00:30:22] Do I really understand the connection of that to my my or my revenue?
[00:30:27] And am I adjusting it according to the benchmarks of other successful businesses, which that I am not doing.
[00:30:37] I can tell you for sure that I'm not doing that and that is something as you were talking about I go boy, I wonder how much I pay in different.
[00:30:43] I have assistance and I have different expenses and I just pay them because I pay them because that's what they charge and it seems to be the right amount.
[00:30:52] But do I really know what percentage of that to my overall rep is I don't.
[00:30:57] And it just doesn't it's like it's never seen that important.
[00:31:01] But of course it's important and it's important for any business to understand, you know, what you're paying out.
[00:31:06] So I am going to to work on that myself.
[00:31:08] Thank you.
[00:31:09] And I'm sure you're inspired a lot of us to do it.
[00:31:11] I think a distinction that's worth making is most people have a profit and loss statement for tax purposes only.
[00:31:17] Sure.
[00:31:18] Which is fine and it's helpful to help your tax filer file your taxes.
[00:31:23] But but I'm talking about something entirely different.
[00:31:25] This is a right business P and L a living breathing document that that up is yeah.
[00:31:30] Yeah, I have one once a year.
[00:31:31] I see it.
[00:31:32] I have a check.
[00:31:34] I've okay done.
[00:31:35] But then it it's never thought about again until the next year when I have to show give her all of the revenue and expenses and she creates another one.
[00:31:43] Yeah, this we are talking about a living document that gets updated on a regular basis that gets studied and it gets adjusted to.
[00:31:50] It's like, Hey, the market's down right now.
[00:31:52] If your income is down right now, have you also, you know, in proportion decreased or at least looked at your expenses and figured out.
[00:31:59] How do I?
[00:32:00] How do I, you know, adjust for the downturn right now?
[00:32:03] And look, a lot of people ask me, well, why do I really need one?
[00:32:06] And my answer is you didn't really don't.
[00:32:09] I you only do in the context of some sort of goal.
[00:32:12] So if you are trying to take more allocate more profit from your business to make more investments or to
[00:32:20] pursue that beach house or to retire someday or to send your kids to college, there has to be some sort of personal goal that you're trying to achieve or or pain point you're trying to solve for perhaps.
[00:32:31] Then you reverse engineer into the machine that is your business.
[00:32:36] And you say, how do I make this machine run more optimally?
[00:32:39] Now, if you have no pain points and you're at a hundred percent of your potential, then I'm like, good for you.
[00:32:45] You should be on DJ's podcast.
[00:32:46] What percentage?
[00:32:48] What percentage of agents are currently operating with their profit and loss without somebody helping them at a hundred percent?
[00:32:59] Is it?
[00:32:59] Are we talking about there's there's like a one percent outlier that kind of just knows how to do this.
[00:33:04] Maybe they come from the accounting background, but I would assume 99% of agents probably could could use a boost.
[00:33:10] There's always an outlier, right?
[00:33:11] Who has got a weird set of skills that they came to the real estate business with this skill set and they're just good because it's something else.
[00:33:18] But it is really rare.
[00:33:20] It's probably in the one or two percent.
[00:33:21] They're well.
[00:33:22] I you know, when you ask agents why did they get the business?
[00:33:25] I'm you know how often do people like, well, because I just love accounting like, wait, but no, it doesn't have.
[00:33:31] So you you have to find a why in order to pay attention to this.
[00:33:38] And that has to be a powerful motivator.
[00:33:42] Otherwise, you're just not going to do it.
[00:33:43] So we spent a fair amount of time DJ and our calls with people saying, look, like why do you actually want to invest the time?
[00:33:50] Because this is not an auto play.
[00:33:52] This is like you actually have to engage in this process or you're going to get a report that is going to you're not going to do anything with.
[00:34:01] So why even get the report right?
[00:34:03] So there is some sort of corresponding.
[00:34:06] I'm trying to grow my business.
[00:34:07] I'm trying to buy X number of real pieces of investment property.
[00:34:12] I'm trying to like what are you working to achieve and how can the business run more transparently and optimally help you do that?
[00:34:20] And I think we should talk just briefly about the psychological benefit of having this information and tracking it and adjusting it on almost a daily basis.
[00:34:30] You know, with something like a quick books or whatever software or system one might be using or working directly with a with a factual CFO or some sort of partner.
[00:34:41] Because this is, you know, what we're really talking about is a little bit of paint upfront, a little bit of, okay, I got to take a good look in the mirror myself, completely naked, which isn't always the most fun thing for any of us to do.
[00:34:53] But I'm going as a result of that I am going to understand I'm going to feel now more in control of my destiny and understand what needs to be done.
[00:35:04] And it's not going to be as sort of at the end of the month.
[00:35:07] I look and I see my bank account is going to be more it's going to be more reliable.
[00:35:12] What what is in there? What isn't in there? Where it's going and I'll know what I can afford to spend for for my personal use my business use.
[00:35:22] And what I need to save and where I need to save it. And there's a tremendous amount of satisfaction and just kind of knowing the plan.
[00:35:31] And it is it's you know, it's a lot it's a lot easier, for example, for me when I wake up and I have all my meals prepared for the week or for that even just for that day.
[00:35:41] And I get to work and I don't have to think about it. Yes, I yes, every Saturday I have to cook to cook a bunch.
[00:35:47] I have to plan this out or Monday noon at 12 o'clock. I start to think what am I going to have for lunch today.
[00:35:53] And then I have to make that decision and it's like, but I want to eat healthy. But I don't want to eat healthy right now because I'm stressed.
[00:35:58] But I want to like it becomes this sort of battle.
[00:36:00] And it's like if I just have my meal prepared, I don't have to make that decision.
[00:36:04] I've already decided in advance it was a healthy option. And I'm going to all have to execute the plan.
[00:36:09] I've actually just execute this healthy option. And you know, sure you you allow yourself some some some wiggle room there.
[00:36:15] But for the most part, you're like, okay, one less one less hard decision to make.
[00:36:20] And that feels powerful and it feels easy.
[00:36:22] Yeah, it allows me to then take that mental energy that finite amount of motivation and discipline that we have each day and then apply it elsewhere.
[00:36:30] So it really is kind of similar to to that maybe for for a lot of us.
[00:36:34] And so if we're willing to do that for our own physical health, right.
[00:36:37] Maybe we should consider something like that for our financial help.
[00:36:40] Yes. And most of the time people are come to come to us because of some sort of external thing.
[00:36:49] Yeah.
[00:36:50] The top two probably are I want to make a hire and I be at a first hire or a 15th hire.
[00:36:57] I want to make a key hire and I want to know my business is ready.
[00:37:02] And because I don't want to let that person down.
[00:37:04] A lot of us are willing to let ourselves down. I'm pretty sure.
[00:37:07] But we're not willing to let somebody else down.
[00:37:09] So maybe you're okay flying by the senior pan's but when you bring it a bunch of people, you're not willing to do it anymore.
[00:37:14] So there's this inflection point around hiring.
[00:37:18] You know, we met with somebody other day who's bringing in a CEO, oh, big hire, big salary to like, can I afford it?
[00:37:25] That's a trigger or the other trigger is I'm paying too much in taxes.
[00:37:29] I know it and or I have issues with the IRS.
[00:37:32] And those are the two things externally kind of that are generally bringing people to this next level conversation in their business that leads to questions around PNL's and tax strategies and figuring out how they move things to the next place.
[00:37:51] Well, and if we think about again, this sort of psychological pressure of those two scenarios of I want to grow and I want to make sure I can afford to grow in this particular way.
[00:37:59] Yeah, and I do this is this a financial wise decision.
[00:38:04] Yeah.
[00:38:05] And then the other way is I've got this pressure on me to fix something that maybe wasn't done perfectly in the past.
[00:38:11] And both of those where they feel totally different just talking about them. Don't they? There's one feels like a heavier weight.
[00:38:17] The other feels like an opportunity that maybe maybe it's not the perfect right time for this, but they'll tell me that.
[00:38:21] But at least I know and at least I don't have that weight on me going, oh my God, how am I going to make payroll?
[00:38:27] Yeah.
[00:38:27] This is this one.
[00:38:28] Yeah, exactly.
[00:38:30] So you don't look we do bookkeeping in taxes, but what we really do is help people sleep better at night.
[00:38:36] Yeah, that's it.
[00:38:37] By giving them the clarity they need to run their business in the aim of their goal, whatever that is.
[00:38:42] And to do it more efficiently, more effectively with more profit to be able to increase their net worth.
[00:38:47] And like we started early in the conversation, actually buy some of these amazing houses that they're selling on behalf of other people.
[00:38:53] Or being a position to do it if they actually wish to versus just aspiring and wishing someday that they maybe could be as successful as their clients are and own those amazing assets.
[00:39:04] Yeah, let's talk about about real estate investing as a way as as a
[00:39:11] possible retirement vehicle or at least a wealth generation.
[00:39:15] Yes, yes, builder and generational wealth, I should say.
[00:39:19] And the idea that home prices have historically again past results to not equal future performance, but that historically the prices of values of homes have trended upwards overtime over long swathes of time.
[00:39:37] And so is the market equity market in particular.
[00:39:40] But we know there's there's dips in both and right now we're experiencing a dip in I guess in both sides.
[00:39:45] But you know there are other alternatives to just 401k investing that there's certainly reasons to do to do them.
[00:39:54] And obviously, you know, lots of us do do sort of traditional equity bond investing for our financial retirement.
[00:40:03] And then there's a other group of people that do that and contribute to investments and see that as a retirement vehicle.
[00:40:11] I'm curious to know, you know, how where do you see not that there's one or the other, but that maybe explain to our audience why that second vehicle is something that's often considered as a retirement vehicle.
[00:40:24] Yeah, so I have a couple thoughts on this and some of our counter popular, but look, as real estate people, we often over index and real estate.
[00:40:33] Yeah, because we like it. We're good at it. We see it. It's handable. It's touchable. You can do stuff with it.
[00:40:42] But is when I look across my success and failures and those are the people I see, I see a number of people who do well real estate and buy an old, but I see just as many if not more, who don't.
[00:40:54] Because they under appreciate the fact that you're buying an asset that has big expenses and one air conditioning going out in one single family rental property and pick your state could tank your return on investment for three or four years.
[00:41:11] Sure. So I love real estate. And I think real estate needs to be part of a broader balanced strategy around wealth creation that needs to be guided by clear professionals who understand what they're doing.
[00:41:25] And as real estate professionals, I'm talking to specifically, we probably need to think even more carefully about other things other than real estate to sure and to make sure that we're, you know, being logical about it.
[00:41:38] Finally, I'll say my experience was, and I see it for a lot of people is the under appreciation that when you do choose to invest in real estate and I built a fairly substantial residential real estate portfolio, I realized it became its own business.
[00:41:51] Sure.
[00:41:53] It wasn't actually an investment per se. It was a business.
[00:41:57] Yeah.
[00:41:58] And the distinction is an investment. I'm using my money to make money a business. I'm using my time and my money to make money heavy on time.
[00:42:08] Yeah.
[00:42:09] So I got up to I think 20 residential units and I was like, holy jumping.
[00:42:16] And I personally, this is not investment advice. It's just my personal desire. I was like, I want to sell these over time and move those money into commercial properties.
[00:42:26] Sure.
[00:42:27] And other kinds of investments so that I am focusing my time on my active business efforts and my money on leveraged opportunities to don't require much time at all.
[00:42:40] So it's a great real estate investing is a great place to start. It's a great place to learn.
[00:42:46] But it's also a great place to be thoughtful about how much time effort and money you're putting into the space.
[00:42:52] We said the other opportunities and make some smart decisions versus I've got a real estate guy had on. I'm therefore only going to invest in real estate.
[00:43:00] Right.
[00:43:00] And I appreciate you sharing what are called and I get pleased correct me if this isn't what were you referencing, but commercial real estate sort of investment transactions could be known as syndication deals.
[00:43:13] Yes, sure.
[00:43:15] Opportunities that could you just quickly explain to our audience who maybe isn't familiar with the idea of a syndication deal sort of what those entail.
[00:43:23] Yes, so.
[00:43:24] Yes, so.
[00:43:25] Look, you can.
[00:43:27] I would explain it this way.
[00:43:29] You can take your own money and your own lending capacity and buy something directly.
[00:43:34] You can take your own money and your own lending capacity and partner with somebody in the two of you or the three of you or the four of you or whatever.
[00:43:42] Buy that asset directly.
[00:43:43] You can pull money from a lot of different people and buy that asset directly and or you can be the guy who has money and you give that money to another group who is actually the one that's pulling together the opportunities and making those investments.
[00:44:00] That other group that's pulling the money together and making those investments can be making those investments and have a variety of different structures.
[00:44:06] Sure.
[00:44:07] Some of which might be direct equity into properties.
[00:44:10] Some of it might be stock ownership and an entity that owns the properties.
[00:44:14] It all gets really highly complex really quickly.
[00:44:17] So for anybody who's interested in saying, look, I don't know that I have the time or money to make a big pull down myself, but I've got 10k.
[00:44:26] I'd love to invest it with another group who's actually doing the work and I'm going to be 0.001% of a larger investment.
[00:44:35] That can be a really good way to leverage, but you've got to know enough to be dangerous so that you don't end up losing that money entirely.
[00:44:42] There's a lot of stuff going on in that space.
[00:44:44] It's like the basically knowing the time value of money is do I want to be running this as my own business?
[00:44:51] Do I want to wear all of those hats?
[00:44:53] Do I want those two way of phone calls about the air conditioner going out?
[00:44:57] Am I willing to take on the hours it just takes to be in the business?
[00:45:04] Right.
[00:45:04] Or am I willing to maybe sacrifice a tiny bit of revenue or substantial depending on and increase some risk, I guess, because you're now taking it out of your hands and doing someone else's hands.
[00:45:16] Just like you would really investing in the equity market, you're really taking it out of your own hands and putting it either to a money manager's hands or directly into a company's hands.
[00:45:25] Of course, anything can happen, but do you really want to do the due diligence on every single stock in your mutual fund that is being invested?
[00:45:35] Or do you want to just hand it over to an investor that has a proven track record?
[00:45:39] 
[00:45:40] And similar thing can exist on the syndication side.
[00:45:42] It's very, it is a little bit more sort of challenging to probably weed through that information and understand exactly what it is.
[00:45:49] But there's a lot of good information out there now where we can learn about what those opportunities are, the benefits, the challenges, you know, the risk associated with it.
[00:45:59] And it's just nice to have that information.
[00:46:01] You can make the best decision for yourself.
[00:46:04] I don't remember who said it that somebody smart, then I'll just take on said, you know, don't invest in anything you don't know.
[00:46:11] And the way I apply that principle is I know business and I know real estate.
[00:46:16] I will make direct investments in real estate or businesses I know and understand, not any old business, but businesses I actually really know.
[00:46:27] Anything else I am using a professional network whose job it is to do that, either a certified financial planner whose job it is to manage the equity markets on my level.
[00:46:39] Or a venture capital fund whose job it is to make 100 investments, only one of which is going to work.
[00:46:48] Right. So that's how I think about that concept.
[00:46:51] DJ is the stuff I'm going to deploy my money and directly either I know directly or I'm going to directly put it into professional organizations that I've vetted and trusted that they that that's that's their one thing to actually do that work.
[00:47:07] Well, let's go back to Alchemy of money. So we know that they can assist with course profit and law statements.
[00:47:13] Let's talk about fractional CFOs.
[00:47:15] Yeah, this is a concept that I was not familiar with up until a few years ago.
[00:47:19] We needed here at our company actually a fractional CEO.
[00:47:23] So for slightly different we actually have somebody who's we consider a CFO, but we didn't have a CEO.
[00:47:28] And so I thought, well, gosh, we can't afford that or or and I'm not even the primary decision maker for that.
[00:47:34] But didn't seem like we could afford it, but we could afford a fractional one.
[00:47:37] And I said, I don't know what that is. I had never heard that term before.
[00:47:41] So let's I suspect a lot of our audience probably has it either. Let's talk about what a fractional CFO is and what they do.
[00:47:47] When you get to about three million revenue, you get to a place where somebody needs to be sitting at the top to coordinate bookkeeping and data reports of a variety of kind taxes.
[00:48:00] Sometimes some age, it was quasi HR related stuff.
[00:48:05] Sometimes some quasi legal stuff and investments.
[00:48:10] And so a fractional CFO and there's a variety of different forms of this and they generally start start at five to $7,000 a month is a resource that you want to bring on to help coordinate at all and advise the ownership globally about what's going on.
[00:48:28] So by then you have a team. You've got a bookkeeper team. You've got a tax team. You've got an investment team.
[00:48:36] Right. So this person is coming on to handle all that. So that's why you got to be at least three million in revenue for that to even make sense as a conversation.
[00:48:45] Most people will bring on a fractional CFO above that, but that's usually where the conversation is had below three million.
[00:48:53] It's you as the owner of the business working on that team, making sure that the bookkeeping and taxes are being handled well that you've got a really good financial plan or that you've got an amazing attorney.
[00:49:04] And you've got a cadence of meetings that you're meeting with that team with throughout the year.
[00:49:08] So I love fractional CFOs when the time is right. And I think they can be a really big inflection point for people whose aspirations and ambitions are to continue to grow well above their current income level.
[00:49:22] Yeah. And I'll come you have money really sort of takes on a lot of different roles that you can sort of decide at what point in your business you're at.
[00:49:32] You know, once you're at that three million dollar annual revenue point, we're now talking about fractional CFO if we're at the, you know, several hundred thousand dollar annual revenue rate.
[00:49:44] We are now talking about another level of service. But at any given level, you guys have professionals to assist.
[00:49:51] Yeah, I'll give you the levels real quick and generally worth.
[00:49:54] You know, if you're up to $250,000 in gross commission income, you're still in sort of a DIY mode, right?
[00:50:02] You're probably you got your brother's uncle's cousin or you're doing it yourself or you're in QuickBooks on Saturday.
[00:50:07] Like you got to probably DIY most of it, right? Except for maybe your taxes, but you don't have very complex taxes yet.
[00:50:13] Right. When you go from 250,000 to let's call it a million and a half, then you've got to get a bookkeeper on board and you've got to get a strategic CPA on board.
[00:50:26] So, and alchemy you can do stu bookkeeping, you can just do CPA services, you could do both.
[00:50:32] But that's really up to about one and a half fish million to two million.
[00:50:37] And so that's a big range from 250,000 to two million. But that's where the business is maturing. That's when your revenue streams are maturing.
[00:50:44] That's when you need these bookkeeping CPA services to really be robust in that period of time.
[00:50:51] As you get closer to that two million, you got to bring on that certified financial planner, which is preparing you for eventually that three million and above where you bring on the fractional CFO.
[00:51:01] So, if you're any of your listeners listening right now, just kind of put yourself in those buckets, like do a little gut check for you.
[00:51:09] How are you doing with your bookkeeper? Like, are you getting monthly profit and loss statements? Do you know what they say?
[00:51:14] Is that working for you? Are you making good decisions? If yes, great. Continue on. If no, work on that.
[00:51:20] Next, are you paying your taxes quarterly? Are you getting strategic tax advice in a written report?
[00:51:26] If not, work on that for the next couple of years. Right. If you are great, move up to financial plan. Right. So there is a sequence to this.
[00:51:36] And you don't just like throw it all on a once, right. You've got to build these expertise within your world over time.
[00:51:43] I love this idea of just getting so granular with this, which a lot of us, you know, as real estate professionals, you know, maybe we're data people and we like looking at spreadsheets.
[00:51:54] And we really appreciate evaluating the numbers. And then some of us are more maybe on the people side where we're good at, you know, the sort of person interpersonal stuff where we're able to close deals, build relationships.
[00:52:08] And this idea that you probably can't be ultra strong in both. You're probably stronger and one than the other, which is just, you know, the way our brains are wired up and our personalities are developed.
[00:52:21] And the cool part is we can get people to help us with the stuff that is it either fun to do or easy to do or just stuff we want to do.
[00:52:29] And we can find people to assist, you know, look, we have we have a doctor that checks our if for responsible checks all of our does a full blood panel once a year and tells us what condition of health we're in.
[00:52:39] We know and if you have a good physician, they're going to say, you know, on the next next year, I want you to focus on one, two, and three. Do those things, you know, more exercise less, whatever.
[00:52:48] And, you know, that's really helpful because I can look at my physical being and say, I think I know what condition it's in. Of course, I don't can't look under the hood.
[00:52:58] I can just see the external stuff. And it gives me some sort of idea of what's going on inside, but not all the all the information.
[00:53:04] And I can go to this professional for relatively inexpensive amount of money and say, let's look at everything inside. And then you're pretty wise. So you tell me what I should do.
[00:53:13] And, you know, to do this with mechanics, if you're smart, you take your car and once a year, whether it's broken down or not, say what's going on with it. Do I need to do anything?
[00:53:22] You know, and you can wait till it's broken down. And then that becomes a lot more stressful. And so it's really talking about this is adding this into this sort of overall team.
[00:53:32] Yeah. You know, some people do this with, you know, some people have therapists to deal with their own emotional.
[00:53:37] Well, be it. You know, we have, we have all sorts of team members. And I love this because on the financial side, I love the idea of not wondering if I can afford something.
[00:53:47] I wonder, I like the idea of an opportunity comes my way because we're real estate people. We see a real estate investment opportunity that we know is going to have cash flow or just going to be this. It's great deal.
[00:53:57] For whatever reason, it's like, oh, I have the information that knows that this is a really good deal. Someone's going to get a really good deal.
[00:54:04] And instead of saying, can I afford to do it? You know, we just go, should I do it? Should I do it right now? I want to do it. I want to do it. I see it.
[00:54:11] And versus a business going, we either can afford to do this or we cannot afford to do this. And we have the data to support either of those decisions. That's a, that's a position of power.
[00:54:20] And it allows us to more sort of, I think, from a, from a wiser perspective, from a higher level of, of, of, of, in selection, to make these decisions not so much based on the emotion of how exciting it is, how cool it is to buy the new shiny thing, but to actually understand, you know, is this shiny thing in our best long term interest.
[00:54:44] Can we do this? And you're talking about hiring. This is a perfect example. So we all want, want more help. Can we afford more help?
[00:54:52] That's the first question. And it's not just, well, I've got money in my bank. So yeah, I can because maybe, you know, you haven't been able to look to see exactly what's going out the door.
[00:55:02] We think we know what's going out the door. But boy, I don't. I need somebody to look at that once a month and look at my expenditures. And I pay somebody to do that.
[00:55:11] And to say, hey, you spent too much money in entertainment this, this, this month, per personal use. I have somebody looking at my personal expenses and really saying, you know, you're going out to eat a little too much.
[00:55:20] I don't like to hear it. But I need to know it so that when I'm like, oh, I want to go out to eat because there's this new restaurant. I now know, well, I have a budget for that. I know how much I can spend in a month.
[00:55:30] And there's there's actual power in that as much as I don't want to be a big boy and play by the rules of, you know, whatever the actual, you know, rules that are there, financially, it's a help to support me.
[00:55:43] I need to or else I'm going to I'm going to put myself in a position of increased stress. And it's going to affect every other part of my life too. So this is a real opportunity for all of us to add, add someone to our team if we don't have one.
[00:55:56] And you know, I'll come me if money is is happy and you know, we'll tell you if if you're ready for their services or not. And if you're not, they'll tell you what to do to get ready.
[00:56:05] Correct. And this is a position of power. You will feel better about yourself. You'll feel better about your your your your your sort of future. And you'll think of your business more like an actual business because every successful business has these processes in place.
[00:56:18] So yeah, maybe you don't have it today, but now's the day to think about making that first phone call, setting up that meeting and saying, I want to be in business for for the next 15 20 30 years.
[00:56:29] I want to also build something that eventually can support my retirement. I want to make sure I'm not overspending. And I want to make sure that, you know, I'm taking advantage of all the tax opportunities that are forwarded to me.
[00:56:38] So Alchemy of money.co is where you go to learn that tell them that you heard it here. And we appreciate that Brandon such a pleasure. I think we should not be more appreciative.
[00:56:50] Brandon Green now is where you find him on Instagram. We will have a link to that in the show notes, but Alchemy of money.co is his company. He works with real estate agents and entrepreneurs all over the country helping them do this.
[00:57:02] He knows he does this because he needed that help himself. And boy, you know, it's funny how things like you were saying that you now have this business that you actually beat it.
[00:57:11] You built something for yourself that now can be used to help others. And they say that necessity is the mother of invention, I guess. So that is as true in this case as it is for anything.
[00:57:23] And it's funny because a lot of agents get their license because they had an experience with another agent they go, I can do that. I can do that better.
[00:57:31] Or I don't, you know, you know, and we're talking about some version of that here. So I think it's pretty cool. He comes from your world. He knows your world. He understands you.
[00:57:40] And he knows what you need to do, you know, to get to that next level. And he wants to help you. And this is a hard enough business. Let's get all the help we can.

And please leave us a review wherever you're listening to us on Spotify, Apple music, wherever. Let us know what you think of the show. We appreciate you and check out our sponsors. Our sponsors are amazing. All right, guys, let's get to it. My conversation with Brandon Green. What is the best piece of advice you have ever received in real estate? DJ, the best piece of advice I got was from a real estate team owner who had sold his team about two years into me being a brand new agent. And I really looked up to him. I was like, how'd you do it? Right? You know, 30-year-instance success guy. And I remember he said, Brandon, you as soon as possible need to begin to treat your business like a business. And even if you never sell your real estate business, start today thinking as if you would. And that was such great foundational advice for me, you're two. Right? I didn't contextualize that for sure, but it made me think about my business immediately different than I think I probably would have otherwise. It's wonderful. And on the flip side, what's the worst piece of advice you've ever received in real estate? I remember this agent in the office. He was like 85, still showing houses on the Saturday. Right? Had a bit of a raspy voice. It was bitter. She couldn't go to brunch. And she's like, you just need to sell another house, sell another house, sell it on her house. And it's all going to work out. I remember that she had that like voice to it. And I remember thinking, maybe I mean, I could, you know, short term that's really helpful. Sure. It's not the long term game. Yeah, maybe there's more. Yeah. Maybe there's more to it. I don't know that I want to be, you know, bitter about not going to brunch and instead doing an open house, you know, when I get well into my later years. Right. So that was an interesting conversation. I remember having with her one Saturday morning as she was hauling her signs to her open house. And I was in the office working out of contract. Sort of sounds like the opposite of freedom to an example. That we all don't need to do the work and and sell that next house. But if maybe if that's the only sort of way you see as a path forward that that certainly can feel defeating, I suppose once you're, you know, slogging around signs when you're, you know, older and maybe wish to not do that as much. So well, Brandon Green is our our guest today on the episode on this episode. We are so excited. He is from Alchemy of Money. We're going to tell you more about his company Alchemy of Money. He's got CEO is where you can go to learn about it. We will have a link to that in our show notes. Well, let me tell you about a bar Brandon. Brandon Green was born in Southwest Wyoming. So he's the first person you probably know from Wyoming. Well, not anymore. People are not flocking to Wyoming. But certainly that wasn't always the case. And but he grew up in Iowa, which is right next door to where I live in Chicago. And in 1999 moved to Washington, DC with no money, no prospects, no college degree. Luckily, he had a knack for sales went into real estate, 2001. Today, he's an award winning entrepreneur and investor committed to helping other real estate entrepreneurs reach financial freedom quicker and with more ease in 2022. Brandon launched his newest venture Alchemy of Money, Inc. A tech enabled financial services company providing bookkeeping, tech strategy and filing fractional CFO services, financial coaching and investments exclusively for real estate professionals. I will break into this for just a quick moment to say, consider getting yourself a CFO for your business. That's called a fractional CFO. If you aren't, you know, you're, you know, this massive corporation, you can actually do that with Brandon's help. We'll tell you more about that in a bit, but you might know Brandon from his time, co-founding and leading Keller Williams capital properties in our nation's capital. Under his leadership, it was named best employer by the Washington Post and grew to be among the top 0.2% of all brokerages nationwide with seven locations and over a thousand REALTORS. Brandon has been featured by the Washington Post Wall Street Journal, Fortune Magazine called into support RE/MAX, Coldwell Banker, Compass, eXp, South of Bees, Berkshire Hathaway and Long and Foster. You know those names. These are the companies that call Brandon and we are grateful to have him on our show today for a little bit of time. Alchemyofmoney.co is where you go to learn about Brandon and Brandon. I'm so sorry, please give your Instagram. Brandon Green now. Brandon Green now will have a link to both of those in our show. Brandon, welcome. Thanks, DJ. Glad to be here. Very excited to have you. You have been in this industry 25 years and very, you've done a lot of really impressive, really impressive things as a bit of a better word, lots of different things. And you know, it's funny. We asked Brandon ahead of time. What do you want to talk about because you have so much knowledge and so much wisdom. He said, you know, I see agents helping people all day long with buying and selling property and whether they're primary residents, investors, whatever. And he says, I don't see them helping themselves as much as I'd like to. And I thought, boy, that's a great reminder. Even for me too, I'm in this business. How often am I helping myself in that particular journey? Not as much as I should. So we're bringing on Brandon's data. Talk more about that. And Brandon, let's get all the way back started in 2001 when you moved. Yeah. You know, from, I guess from Iowa all the way to DC, by the way, I just went to my very first Iowa football game. Last, last year, my girlfriend's family. A lot of them are in Iowa and we got to see, we had some tickets that were not being used that week. And I got to see that, that type of football game, which was really great. And I got to see the, what they call the greatest, the greatest, oh gosh, I'm blanking on the word. But, but the greatest sort of ritual in college football where there's a, there was a children's ward of a hospital. I believe it's a cancer ward and it overlooks the stadium and Apple. Order. Yeah, everybody including the players on both sides and all everyone in the stadium turns and waves towards the children. And boy, that was a moment to behold. So if you, anyone ever gets a chance to go to an Iowa football game, boy, that is, that is something you will not forget. But anyway, you moved to DC. So tell us, tell us about that. Yeah, I did. I moved to DC. Just looking for some opportunity, wanted to get in a big city to really have, particularly any plans. And then probably go to school here. I had graduated from high school in Iowa and then went on the road touring with an international musical organization singing and dancing. And that was a great time. And at some point after doing that for a couple of years, I was like, either I need to pursue forming arts full time. Or I need to figure out something else and decided something else was my option. So yeah, landed in, in the area doing a cold calling for staffing firm. That was my first job. So my job was to find a list of companies, cold call them and see if they'd be interested in hiring us to help them recruit for their open positions. And you know, traditional sales back, environment, you know, ring a bell when you make a sale, do a hundred cold calls a day. You got to take five people to lunch, close three deals, t t t t t t. And honestly, I really liked it. I liked the energy around it. I liked the fact I could see a direct correlation between my efforts and my income. It didn't have a lot of meaningfulness to it. And so, you know, after a couple of years, I was like, maybe there's something else here. And so late one night, I was watching a Carlton Sheetz infomercial. Now, I don't know how long he's been doing this 60 years. And one of the, one of the first guys to really do a lot on television about about real estate and fasting in particular. He was your early in marketing influencer, right, with how he was. Yeah, he was. Yeah, he was. And he may have been the first true real estate investor influencer. That's right. Yeah, it's true. And you know, and I bought his course, right? This was now in the early 2000s. It was like, you know, mail it to your house and so forth. And I remember thinking DJ like, okay, yeah, there's probably more to it than rich and be on a beach with the martini 90 days. But it did inspire me to say, well, how can I do this? And how can I get into the real estate game myself? So I bought my first investment property using an FHA 203K renovation loan, which you're not supposed to use for investment properties. I don't know, we recording this. But I bought it and I sold that property, made some money and I thought, out. Maybe this is my jam. So that's what got me into real estate was really aspiring for something bigger for myself than, you know, relentless coal calling forever. And I liked the intersection of people income, possibility. And I really liked old houses and real estate and renovating them. So that was the beginning. Yeah. And how did that proceed from there? Did you go sort of fully into the investor side or were you still? Both doing traditional real estate brokerage, helping public with their primary residences or was it just investor full steam? First as an investor, I quickly realized, well, I could buy one with the W2 income I had from my other job. But that was it that I needed to come up with another way to make money. So I quit the W2 job in full time in the sales. I could see that I could use my income from my sales business to purchase more real estate. Yeah. So I applied the coal calling skills that I'd learned in the other environment to real estate sales and door knocking. So I just started going to grid it out in neighborhood and I was like, well, there's got to be some sort of ratio here of X number of doors, why number of people answer them, Z number of people and bite me in and a converts B signs up for. So I just applied those tried and true sales principles I learned in the other shop over to real estate and I quickly learned like nobody works at hard in real estate. It's like nobody is door knocking 100 doors a day like. Well, if I do that, then I could really take off. So I sold 12 million that first year, 20 million in real estate the second year. I'd deploying literally night and day, rain snow, whatever door knocking and then hosting open houses for more senior agents in the office who didn't want to do it anymore. In order to fund my real estate investment business and my personal lifestyle, right? I have no other income. Sure. So that's what like push push me into the industry fully as both an investor and a practitioner and sales. I love that you took the money that you earned in sort of the traditional side of it and decided to reinvest it into a different side of it, which would ideally basically funding you could say funding retirement, you could say funding, you know, a cash flow, current cash flow lifestyle, you know, some nice tax benefits along the way as well. And yeah, I know a lot of guys who affects this happens a lot. I think on the lending side. So you know, people who are around loans all day a lot of times are going wait a minute. Why am I not doing more? You know, I own maybe I own my own condo or where I live. But I'm seeing all these other people get loans and you know work on the on the cash flow side. And boy, it seems very enticing, but I don't see as many REALTORS taking advantage of that. So let's I think let's dive into what are some of the challenges or where the where some of the roadblocks that REALTORS you know, maybe they're not thinking about doing this. Maybe they're feeling like they don't have the income to do it. Yep. And or maybe they're thinking, you know, gosh, I have to fund my own individual set by array or I have to, you know, contribute to other expenses and they're not setting aside money. Maybe to do this. So I'd love to talk about where you see agents kind of first kind of going wrong or not necessarily going wrong, but just not exploring this as an opportunity. So first, if they already know intellectually it's an opportunity and I think most do sure then either they're not truly being honest with themselves about the amount of time that's necessary to run two businesses because that's what it is. It's two businesses. It's an investment business and it's a sales business. So that's 80 hours a week. Let's call it is, right? So they're not giving it the time it needs to actually get one of the other up and running for a lot of legitimate reasons. It's could have family other obligations, whatever. When I did it, look, I had no family. I had no friends. I had no family. There's nothing else going on in my life. So I put all I had into it. So I think you've got to organize your life in such a way that you can go all in on something for a period of time at the consequence of something else. Sure. And most people don't want to make that trade off. Yeah. But that's the truth of it. But if they do, there's yet another issue and that is taxes. And I remember quickly realizing that while I was getting ahead on my income and I was acquiring more assets, I was getting behind on my taxes because I was using all my income to purchase real estate and the fund. What was a growing lifestyle? Let's be honest. Sure. I like to have fun. I like to spend the money. So that was like increasing. And a lot of the tax benefits around real estate don't kick in immediately. They come over time. And so I found myself with the third leg of this stool going, Uncle Sam saying, Hey, I appreciate the fact you've taken all your active cashflow and invested in real estate and taken some wild trips. But what about me? And so I got in a hole with the IRS early on, like by half a million dollars. And it was very embarrassing, DJ, very painful, very hard to deal with. I can now see, you know, a couple decades later, that that is a huge hindrance for people executing the game was not figuring out that third component. The third partner at the table, if you will, who is requiring renumeration and how to do that and still fund your business, fund your lifestyle and fund investments. Well, it's certainly a, yeah, stand the feeling like you should have done it because of course we always feel that way about mistakes or at least it's a natural way to think we should have should have done better. And at the same time, you know, we think, what was he doing with that money? He was actually funding his business and he was actually using it for a greater good. It wasn't, you know, entirely going to your own personal enjoyment. And so it's, it's something that, you know, we, we have to, it's easy to forget about that third partner, I suspect because of course, REALTOR is when they get paid. They don't necessarily those taxes aren't taken out right away. Maybe, you know, if they're disciplined, they have it automatically going to somewhere else where they can't see it for a while and just sort of under almost like lock and key. But if they're like most of us, we see that big amount hit our bank and we don't think I should probably put a third of that somewhere else because of course nobody wants to think that way. I don't want to think that we might think about it, but we don't actually do it right in. I mean, actually, I didn't even think about it honestly. The first three years I got in the business, it was year three DJ where I was like, wait a minute, I think I need to file taxes. Right. Because I was, I had all sales training. I was learning about being a real estate investor, but nobody, like I wasn't being trained. I wasn't seeking it out. I'm sure it was available. But I wasn't seeking out business training, how to run a prop and a law statement and manage cash flow. And I wasn't interested in that. I was interested in selling houses, helping people buying real estate grow, grow, grow. And the rest is going to figure itself out. And I hit a real wall in realized, oh, shoot, right there. No, yeah. No, you can get pretty far with that energy. But you can't probably accomplish ultimately what you want because you end up hitting some sort of wall I headed. Right. Yeah. At some point, there's, you know, this, this, this, you know, it's this three-legged stool that that third leg is not there. And it's getting wobbly and all of a sudden now we have, it's the most important leg of the stool because it's, it's affecting everything else. And again, certainly a relatable topic for a lot of us. I think all of us have, especially when, you know, we're being paid the full full amount from our commissions, you know, right to our bank account. It is so easy to not have a disciplined approach to, to putting that money in, in sort of buckets. And I, I've, I've fall prey to that myself. It's not something that I think anybody cannot relate to. So, I think you probably just certainly connected with a lot of, a lot of people on, on the call. And then there's the issue of education. We, we started to think about, okay, well, what, you know, aside from just moving a half, I don't know, third of it somewhere else, you know, letting it sit in a money market, you know, which is fine. But there are other options as well. And, you know, there's ways to maybe reduce that amount that you have to pay. And there are strategies that are, you know, they're put that are, they are afforded to us under the tax code. That is not about, you know, trying to, you know, pull a fast one on the government, but actually to take advantage in a positive way of what the government allows us to do. And what the government really sort of encourages us to do in order to fund, you know, small businesses are the backbone of this country. We're talking small business. And this is, you know, a lot of times small businesses don't have this understanding. You know, you're, they're doing all putting on all the hats, you're in charge of growth, you're in charge of health service, you're in charge of clients. And, you know, all of a sudden you have this, why don't I have somebody sort of reminding you to do these things because we can't do everything. So, let's talk about that. So, so what do you usually recommend to the agents as a way to get started to think about managing their finances? Yeah, yeah. So I remember having this conversation with my financial mentor as I was trying to figure out how to get out of this $500,000 whole, right. He's like, well, he said just what you said, right? Well, while as a business owner, as an asset owner, you have all these tax strategies you can deploy in order to significantly reduce your tax rate. And I was like, well, sign me up like let's do it. It goes, yeah, here's the problem. You don't have any underlying data to actually organize into the strategies. You don't have a proper and lasting. You're not tracking your expenses by category. You don't have any reconciled bank statement. There's nothing I can do for you because you don't have any of the data. And I was like, oh, right. So that sent me down a three year journey. And so when I would say to that DJ for anybody who's listening that might resonate with this situation is most people need to start with better data. And the data takes the form of good bookkeeping and an accurate statement of income and expenses reconciled monthly that shows actually what you've got going on. So you can take it to professional, whether it's an alchemy or somewhere else, and saying, here's actually what I'm doing in report format. What strategies are available to me? So we like to skip to the strategies. Like, sign me up for saving $8.00 on my taxes. But the data has to be in a way that that can be done. And then the other thing I learned that is sort of a cousin to that is the IRS has this like this or that it's never all or both. So for example, a strategy that many people probably know about is some form of retirement funding to reduce your tax liability 401k or an IRA. So the tax code essentially says, hey, you can fund your future and we'll give you tax benefit. But you actually have to put the cash in the account. So you either pay it to us, Uncle Sam, or you pay it to yourself, but you still have to pay it, which means you still have to have the cash to do it. You can't have spent it elsewhere. So getting to a place where you have the cash and have the data to deploy the strategies to reduce the overall amount you're paying in taxes. You're still going to outlay more or less the same amount of cash. Sure. Which you're going to outlay it to yourself versus the IRS. I think that's a little bit less understood. People are like, well, it's just going to be less cash out the door to anybody. Right. And it's actually no, no, no, it's less cash to the IRS and more to yourself via investments. Right. It's still money that has to be invested, which means you still have to have it, which means you still need to run your business well and profit. So you're going to have to have the cash to do those strategies. That's a really important distinction. I think that's a nuance that I'm glad you mentioned, which is this. Yes, you are if done properly in your in a certain category of income for your business, where you can reduce some of that tax liability. It becomes really easy to see that savings as just extra income that I get to because I own the company. I get access to. And yes, I guess technically that's true to a degree. Yes, you do have access to that. And yes, you can do what you wish with that or you could do what other responsible businesses do and think about. How do we use this to continue to keep the company solvent? How do we use this to keep maybe grow my company? And how do we just do the responsible thing? Which of course is what a CFO's job is is to make sure that a company is doing all of the right moves. Financial for the future. It's like what's that show that he's like, but it's a write off and he's like demon. But a write off you have to have the cat. What is that shits Creek or something? Yeah, well, I just I just write it off. Yeah, yeah, yeah. No. You might get you might get 30% 35% of it back possibly. But but you're still yeah, it's yeah, I thought that too. When I when I first started a business started my own business. I was like, wait, what exactly is the right off? Does it what does it mean? And I and I did I had that thought that oh, like, oh, I don't have to pay for this. It's somehow it's free. And when that be nice. So so yeah, so tell us about Alchemy of money. Yeah, so all that experience. Many years later, informed my real passion around this topic. And that passion led to forming a company to help other people go through the journey, hopefully more successfully faster than I did around their finances. So today we help real estate entrepreneurs around the country with their bookkeeping like getting the data, the production of profit loss reports and balance sheets and understanding and interpreting what the data is telling you. And then with their taxes, either tax strategy or tax issues or just tax filing, whatever somebody actually needs. So we're running the back in finance of agents and teams all around the country. And it's been really exciting to do that. And so ironic DJ like the biggest, like personally, like some of the biggest problems I had early in my career, I know what a company actually help make people do it. I find I met with the mentor that same mentor I was actually telling you about a moment ago. I met with him for a lunch about three weeks ago. And he leans over the table when he goes, isn't it funny that you own an accounting firm? I was like, he's like, I never had that on my bingo card for you 20 years ago. I'm like, I'm not a bingo card for myself. Right. So that's what we're doing DJ is we're saying, look, we know agents. I've been, like, there's nobody knows agents. We know the issues. We know the opportunities and we know people like to keep those. I love that. So let's talk about some of the services, Yopper. Yeah. So the first one is the generation of a profit and loss statement. And let's pull all of your income expenses together and create a report that tells you how much money you're really making. You know, it's a lot of people manage their finance through their bank app. I have cash. I don't have cash. That is completely irrelevant in terms of whether you have profit and how much tax you owe, whether you're running your business well or not. You know, it's no secret. The market's been tough for a while continues to be it is not really feasible for most people to just we need and be successful year after year. Everybody eventually comes to the same conclusion in their business that they stay long enough, which is I need a profit and loss statement. So that's one big core business is the production and interpretation of that. So it's not just here's your data, but it's also saying, for example, DJ, okay. You're spending 14.5% of your gross commission income on lead generation conversion. The model for a business of your size is 9.5%. Right. So, so what are you doing with that extra is that needed what's your return on investment on that? Oh, and by the way, you're you're paying 5% more of your gross towards compensation and employees than the model. Is that working or is that not working for you? Like, let's have a real discussion around that. So it is back to that first really important good piece of advice I got early on, which was treat my business like a business. This is how you do that is through a P and L. So that's one big service is through the bookkeeping side. You know, that is that is such a really important P and L. It's funny. We've talked to other. You know, sort of tax specialists on the show over the years, they don't really talk profit and loss as much as we're doing now. Not that they don't I'm sure wish for everyone to have one because I'm sure they do we just don't have and talked about it. So I appreciate this conversation because again, a lot of us do have accounts and we think, okay, well, I've got a count. And I do have a corporation set up. So I'm paying myself sort of understand I'm doing something with pass through income and that's, you know, good for me with tax liability. But do I really understand my expenditures? Do I really understand the connection of that to my my or my revenue? And am I adjusting it according to the benchmarks of other successful businesses, which that I am not doing. I can tell you for sure that I'm not doing that and that is something as you were talking about I go boy, I wonder how much I pay in different. I have assistance and I have different expenses and I just pay them because I pay them because that's what they charge and it seems to be the right amount. But do I really know what percentage of that to my overall rep is I don't. And it just doesn't it's like it's never seen that important. But of course it's important and it's important for any business to understand, you know, what you're paying out. So I am going to to work on that myself. Thank you. And I'm sure you're inspired a lot of us to do it. I think a distinction that's worth making is most people have a profit and loss statement for tax purposes only. Sure. Which is fine and it's helpful to help your tax filer file your taxes. But but I'm talking about something entirely different. This is a right business P and L a living breathing document that that up is yeah. Yeah, I have one once a year. I see it. I have a check. I've okay done. But then it it's never thought about again until the next year when I have to show give her all of the revenue and expenses and she creates another one. Yeah, this we are talking about a living document that gets updated on a regular basis that gets studied and it gets adjusted to. It's like, Hey, the market's down right now. If your income is down right now, have you also, you know, in proportion decreased or at least looked at your expenses and figured out. How do I? How do I, you know, adjust for the downturn right now? And look, a lot of people ask me, well, why do I really need one? And my answer is you didn't really don't. I you only do in the context of some sort of goal. So if you are trying to take more allocate more profit from your business to make more investments or to pursue that beach house or to retire someday or to send your kids to college, there has to be some sort of personal goal that you're trying to achieve or or pain point you're trying to solve for perhaps. Then you reverse engineer into the machine that is your business. And you say, how do I make this machine run more optimally? Now, if you have no pain points and you're at a hundred percent of your potential, then I'm like, good for you. You should be on DJ's podcast. What percentage? What percentage of agents are currently operating with their profit and loss without somebody helping them at a hundred percent? Is it? Are we talking about there's there's like a one percent outlier that kind of just knows how to do this. Maybe they come from the accounting background, but I would assume 99% of agents probably could could use a boost. There's always an outlier, right? Who has got a weird set of skills that they came to the real estate business with this skill set and they're just good because it's something else. But it is really rare. It's probably in the one or two percent. They're well. I you know, when you ask agents why did they get the business? I'm you know how often do people like, well, because I just love accounting like, wait, but no, it doesn't have. So you you have to find a why in order to pay attention to this. And that has to be a powerful motivator. Otherwise, you're just not going to do it. So we spent a fair amount of time DJ and our calls with people saying, look, like why do you actually want to invest the time? Because this is not an auto play. This is like you actually have to engage in this process or you're going to get a report that is going to you're not going to do anything with. So why even get the report right? So there is some sort of corresponding. I'm trying to grow my business. I'm trying to buy X number of real pieces of investment property. I'm trying to like what are you working to achieve and how can the business run more transparently and optimally help you do that? And I think we should talk just briefly about the psychological benefit of having this information and tracking it and adjusting it on almost a daily basis. You know, with something like a quick books or whatever software or system one might be using or working directly with a with a factual CFO or some sort of partner. Because this is, you know, what we're really talking about is a little bit of paint upfront, a little bit of, okay, I got to take a good look in the mirror myself, completely naked, which isn't always the most fun thing for any of us to do. But I'm going as a result of that I am going to understand I'm going to feel now more in control of my destiny and understand what needs to be done. And it's not going to be as sort of at the end of the month. I look and I see my bank account is going to be more it's going to be more reliable. What what is in there? What isn't in there? Where it's going and I'll know what I can afford to spend for for my personal use my business use. And what I need to save and where I need to save it. And there's a tremendous amount of satisfaction and just kind of knowing the plan. And it is it's you know, it's a lot it's a lot easier, for example, for me when I wake up and I have all my meals prepared for the week or for that even just for that day. And I get to work and I don't have to think about it. Yes, I yes, every Saturday I have to cook to cook a bunch. I have to plan this out or Monday noon at 12 o'clock. I start to think what am I going to have for lunch today. And then I have to make that decision and it's like, but I want to eat healthy. But I don't want to eat healthy right now because I'm stressed. But I want to like it becomes this sort of battle. And it's like if I just have my meal prepared, I don't have to make that decision. I've already decided in advance it was a healthy option. And I'm going to all have to execute the plan. I've actually just execute this healthy option. And you know, sure you you allow yourself some some some wiggle room there. But for the most part, you're like, okay, one less one less hard decision to make. And that feels powerful and it feels easy. Yeah, it allows me to then take that mental energy that finite amount of motivation and discipline that we have each day and then apply it elsewhere. So it really is kind of similar to to that maybe for for a lot of us. And so if we're willing to do that for our own physical health, right. Maybe we should consider something like that for our financial help. Yes. And most of the time people are come to come to us because of some sort of external thing. Yeah. The top two probably are I want to make a hire and I be at a first hire or a 15th hire. I want to make a key hire and I want to know my business is ready. And because I don't want to let that person down. A lot of us are willing to let ourselves down. I'm pretty sure. But we're not willing to let somebody else down. So maybe you're okay flying by the senior pan's but when you bring it a bunch of people, you're not willing to do it anymore. So there's this inflection point around hiring. You know, we met with somebody other day who's bringing in a CEO, oh, big hire, big salary to like, can I afford it? That's a trigger or the other trigger is I'm paying too much in taxes. I know it and or I have issues with the IRS. And those are the two things externally kind of that are generally bringing people to this next level conversation in their business that leads to questions around PNL's and tax strategies and figuring out how they move things to the next place. Well, and if we think about again, this sort of psychological pressure of those two scenarios of I want to grow and I want to make sure I can afford to grow in this particular way. Yeah, and I do this is this a financial wise decision. Yeah. And then the other way is I've got this pressure on me to fix something that maybe wasn't done perfectly in the past. And both of those where they feel totally different just talking about them. Don't they? There's one feels like a heavier weight. The other feels like an opportunity that maybe maybe it's not the perfect right time for this, but they'll tell me that. But at least I know and at least I don't have that weight on me going, oh my God, how am I going to make payroll? Yeah. This is this one. Yeah, exactly. So you don't look we do bookkeeping in taxes, but what we really do is help people sleep better at night. Yeah, that's it. By giving them the clarity they need to run their business in the aim of their goal, whatever that is. And to do it more efficiently, more effectively with more profit to be able to increase their net worth. And like we started early in the conversation, actually buy some of these amazing houses that they're selling on behalf of other people. Or being a position to do it if they actually wish to versus just aspiring and wishing someday that they maybe could be as successful as their clients are and own those amazing assets. Yeah, let's talk about about real estate investing as a way as as a possible retirement vehicle or at least a wealth generation. Yes, yes, builder and generational wealth, I should say. And the idea that home prices have historically again past results to not equal future performance, but that historically the prices of values of homes have trended upwards overtime over long swathes of time. And so is the market equity market in particular. But we know there's there's dips in both and right now we're experiencing a dip in I guess in both sides. But you know there are other alternatives to just 401k investing that there's certainly reasons to do to do them. And obviously, you know, lots of us do do sort of traditional equity bond investing for our financial retirement. And then there's a other group of people that do that and contribute to investments and see that as a retirement vehicle. I'm curious to know, you know, how where do you see not that there's one or the other, but that maybe explain to our audience why that second vehicle is something that's often considered as a retirement vehicle. Yeah, so I have a couple thoughts on this and some of our counter popular, but look, as real estate people, we often over index and real estate. Yeah, because we like it. We're good at it. We see it. It's handable. It's touchable. You can do stuff with it. But is when I look across my success and failures and those are the people I see, I see a number of people who do well real estate and buy an old, but I see just as many if not more, who don't. Because they under appreciate the fact that you're buying an asset that has big expenses and one air conditioning going out in one single family rental property and pick your state could tank your return on investment for three or four years. Sure. So I love real estate. And I think real estate needs to be part of a broader balanced strategy around wealth creation that needs to be guided by clear professionals who understand what they're doing. And as real estate professionals, I'm talking to specifically, we probably need to think even more carefully about other things other than real estate to sure and to make sure that we're, you know, being logical about it. Finally, I'll say my experience was, and I see it for a lot of people is the under appreciation that when you do choose to invest in real estate and I built a fairly substantial residential real estate portfolio, I realized it became its own business. Sure. It wasn't actually an investment per se. It was a business. Yeah. And the distinction is an investment. I'm using my money to make money a business. I'm using my time and my money to make money heavy on time. Yeah. So I got up to I think 20 residential units and I was like, holy jumping. And I personally, this is not investment advice. It's just my personal desire. I was like, I want to sell these over time and move those money into commercial properties. Sure. And other kinds of investments so that I am focusing my time on my active business efforts and my money on leveraged opportunities to don't require much time at all. So it's a great real estate investing is a great place to start. It's a great place to learn. But it's also a great place to be thoughtful about how much time effort and money you're putting into the space. We said the other opportunities and make some smart decisions versus I've got a real estate guy had on. I'm therefore only going to invest in real estate. Right. And I appreciate you sharing what are called and I get pleased correct me if this isn't what were you referencing, but commercial real estate sort of investment transactions could be known as syndication deals. Yes, sure. Opportunities that could you just quickly explain to our audience who maybe isn't familiar with the idea of a syndication deal sort of what those entail. Yes, so. Yes, so. Look, you can. I would explain it this way. You can take your own money and your own lending capacity and buy something directly. You can take your own money and your own lending capacity and partner with somebody in the two of you or the three of you or the four of you or whatever. Buy that asset directly. You can pull money from a lot of different people and buy that asset directly and or you can be the guy who has money and you give that money to another group who is actually the one that's pulling together the opportunities and making those investments. That other group that's pulling the money together and making those investments can be making those investments and have a variety of different structures. Sure. Some of which might be direct equity into properties. Some of it might be stock ownership and an entity that owns the properties. It all gets really highly complex really quickly. So for anybody who's interested in saying, look, I don't know that I have the time or money to make a big pull down myself, but I've got 10k. I'd love to invest it with another group who's actually doing the work and I'm going to be 0.001% of a larger investment. That can be a really good way to leverage, but you've got to know enough to be dangerous so that you don't end up losing that money entirely. There's a lot of stuff going on in that space. It's like the basically knowing the time value of money is do I want to be running this as my own business? Do I want to wear all of those hats? Do I want those two way of phone calls about the air conditioner going out? Am I willing to take on the hours it just takes to be in the business? Right. Or am I willing to maybe sacrifice a tiny bit of revenue or substantial depending on and increase some risk, I guess, because you're now taking it out of your hands and doing someone else's hands. Just like you would really investing in the equity market, you're really taking it out of your own hands and putting it either to a money manager's hands or directly into a company's hands. Of course, anything can happen, but do you really want to do the due diligence on every single stock in your mutual fund that is being invested? Or do you want to just hand it over to an investor that has a proven track record? And similar thing can exist on the syndication side. It's very, it is a little bit more sort of challenging to probably weed through that information and understand exactly what it is. But there's a lot of good information out there now where we can learn about what those opportunities are, the benefits, the challenges, you know, the risk associated with it. And it's just nice to have that information. You can make the best decision for yourself. I don't remember who said it that somebody smart, then I'll just take on said, you know, don't invest in anything you don't know. And the way I apply that principle is I know business and I know real estate. I will make direct investments in real estate or businesses I know and understand, not any old business, but businesses I actually really know. Anything else I am using a professional network whose job it is to do that, either a certified financial planner whose job it is to manage the equity markets on my level. Or a venture capital fund whose job it is to make 100 investments, only one of which is going to work. Right. So that's how I think about that concept. DJ is the stuff I'm going to deploy my money and directly either I know directly or I'm going to directly put it into professional organizations that I've vetted and trusted that they that that's that's their one thing to actually do that work. Well, let's go back to Alchemy of money. So we know that they can assist with course profit and law statements. Let's talk about fractional CFOs. Yeah, this is a concept that I was not familiar with up until a few years ago. We needed here at our company actually a fractional CEO. So for slightly different we actually have somebody who's we consider a CFO, but we didn't have a CEO. And so I thought, well, gosh, we can't afford that or or and I'm not even the primary decision maker for that. But didn't seem like we could afford it, but we could afford a fractional one. And I said, I don't know what that is. I had never heard that term before. So let's I suspect a lot of our audience probably has it either. Let's talk about what a fractional CFO is and what they do. When you get to about three million revenue, you get to a place where somebody needs to be sitting at the top to coordinate bookkeeping and data reports of a variety of kind taxes. Sometimes some age, it was quasi HR related stuff. Sometimes some quasi legal stuff and investments. And so a fractional CFO and there's a variety of different forms of this and they generally start start at five to $7,000 a month is a resource that you want to bring on to help coordinate at all and advise the ownership globally about what's going on. So by then you have a team. You've got a bookkeeper team. You've got a tax team. You've got an investment team. Right. So this person is coming on to handle all that. So that's why you got to be at least three million in revenue for that to even make sense as a conversation. Most people will bring on a fractional CFO above that, but that's usually where the conversation is had below three million. It's you as the owner of the business working on that team, making sure that the bookkeeping and taxes are being handled well that you've got a really good financial plan or that you've got an amazing attorney. And you've got a cadence of meetings that you're meeting with that team with throughout the year. So I love fractional CFOs when the time is right. And I think they can be a really big inflection point for people whose aspirations and ambitions are to continue to grow well above their current income level. Yeah. And I'll come you have money really sort of takes on a lot of different roles that you can sort of decide at what point in your business you're at. You know, once you're at that three million dollar annual revenue point, we're now talking about fractional CFO if we're at the, you know, several hundred thousand dollar annual revenue rate. We are now talking about another level of service. But at any given level, you guys have professionals to assist. Yeah, I'll give you the levels real quick and generally worth. You know, if you're up to $250,000 in gross commission income, you're still in sort of a DIY mode, right? You're probably you got your brother's uncle's cousin or you're doing it yourself or you're in QuickBooks on Saturday. Like you got to probably DIY most of it, right? Except for maybe your taxes, but you don't have very complex taxes yet. Right. When you go from 250,000 to let's call it a million and a half, then you've got to get a bookkeeper on board and you've got to get a strategic CPA on board. So, and alchemy you can do stu bookkeeping, you can just do CPA services, you could do both. But that's really up to about one and a half fish million to two million. And so that's a big range from 250,000 to two million. But that's where the business is maturing. That's when your revenue streams are maturing. That's when you need these bookkeeping CPA services to really be robust in that period of time. As you get closer to that two million, you got to bring on that certified financial planner, which is preparing you for eventually that three million and above where you bring on the fractional CFO. So, if you're any of your listeners listening right now, just kind of put yourself in those buckets, like do a little gut check for you. How are you doing with your bookkeeper? Like, are you getting monthly profit and loss statements? Do you know what they say? Is that working for you? Are you making good decisions? If yes, great. Continue on. If no, work on that. Next, are you paying your taxes quarterly? Are you getting strategic tax advice in a written report? If not, work on that for the next couple of years. Right. If you are great, move up to financial plan. Right. So there is a sequence to this. And you don't just like throw it all on a once, right. You've got to build these expertise within your world over time. I love this idea of just getting so granular with this, which a lot of us, you know, as real estate professionals, you know, maybe we're data people and we like looking at spreadsheets. And we really appreciate evaluating the numbers. And then some of us are more maybe on the people side where we're good at, you know, the sort of person interpersonal stuff where we're able to close deals, build relationships. And this idea that you probably can't be ultra strong in both. You're probably stronger and one than the other, which is just, you know, the way our brains are wired up and our personalities are developed. And the cool part is we can get people to help us with the stuff that is it either fun to do or easy to do or just stuff we want to do. And we can find people to assist, you know, look, we have we have a doctor that checks our if for responsible checks all of our does a full blood panel once a year and tells us what condition of health we're in. We know and if you have a good physician, they're going to say, you know, on the next next year, I want you to focus on one, two, and three. Do those things, you know, more exercise less, whatever. And, you know, that's really helpful because I can look at my physical being and say, I think I know what condition it's in. Of course, I don't can't look under the hood. I can just see the external stuff. And it gives me some sort of idea of what's going on inside, but not all the all the information. And I can go to this professional for relatively inexpensive amount of money and say, let's look at everything inside. And then you're pretty wise. So you tell me what I should do. And, you know, to do this with mechanics, if you're smart, you take your car and once a year, whether it's broken down or not, say what's going on with it. Do I need to do anything? You know, and you can wait till it's broken down. And then that becomes a lot more stressful. And so it's really talking about this is adding this into this sort of overall team. Yeah. You know, some people do this with, you know, some people have therapists to deal with their own emotional. Well, be it. You know, we have, we have all sorts of team members. And I love this because on the financial side, I love the idea of not wondering if I can afford something. I wonder, I like the idea of an opportunity comes my way because we're real estate people. We see a real estate investment opportunity that we know is going to have cash flow or just going to be this. It's great deal. For whatever reason, it's like, oh, I have the information that knows that this is a really good deal. Someone's going to get a really good deal. And instead of saying, can I afford to do it? You know, we just go, should I do it? Should I do it right now? I want to do it. I want to do it. I see it. And versus a business going, we either can afford to do this or we cannot afford to do this. And we have the data to support either of those decisions. That's a, that's a position of power. And it allows us to more sort of, I think, from a, from a wiser perspective, from a higher level of, of, of, of, in selection, to make these decisions not so much based on the emotion of how exciting it is, how cool it is to buy the new shiny thing, but to actually understand, you know, is this shiny thing in our best long term interest. Can we do this? And you're talking about hiring. This is a perfect example. So we all want, want more help. Can we afford more help? That's the first question. And it's not just, well, I've got money in my bank. So yeah, I can because maybe, you know, you haven't been able to look to see exactly what's going out the door. We think we know what's going out the door. But boy, I don't. I need somebody to look at that once a month and look at my expenditures. And I pay somebody to do that. And to say, hey, you spent too much money in entertainment this, this, this month, per personal use. I have somebody looking at my personal expenses and really saying, you know, you're going out to eat a little too much. I don't like to hear it. But I need to know it so that when I'm like, oh, I want to go out to eat because there's this new restaurant. I now know, well, I have a budget for that. I know how much I can spend in a month. And there's there's actual power in that as much as I don't want to be a big boy and play by the rules of, you know, whatever the actual, you know, rules that are there, financially, it's a help to support me. I need to or else I'm going to I'm going to put myself in a position of increased stress. And it's going to affect every other part of my life too. So this is a real opportunity for all of us to add, add someone to our team if we don't have one. And you know, I'll come me if money is is happy and you know, we'll tell you if if you're ready for their services or not. And if you're not, they'll tell you what to do to get ready. Correct. And this is a position of power. You will feel better about yourself. You'll feel better about your your your your your sort of future. And you'll think of your business more like an actual business because every successful business has these processes in place. So yeah, maybe you don't have it today, but now's the day to think about making that first phone call, setting up that meeting and saying, I want to be in business for for the next 15 20 30 years. I want to also build something that eventually can support my retirement. I want to make sure I'm not overspending. And I want to make sure that, you know, I'm taking advantage of all the tax opportunities that are forwarded to me.
