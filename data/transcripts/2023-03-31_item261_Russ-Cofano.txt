[00:04:29] Russ, welcome to the show.
[00:04:31] Thank you, DJ.
[00:04:32] Thanks for having me and looking forward to a great discussion about marketing for real estate
[00:04:36] agents.
[00:04:36] Yeah, let's dive into it.
[00:04:39] Normally, you've done everything in this industry.
[00:04:43] You've been on really all different sides of the business.
[00:04:47] I'd actually had loved it first before we get into marketing.
[00:04:51] We'd love to learn a little bit about your journey.
[00:04:53] How did you get involved in real estate?
[00:04:56] Obviously, you're an attorney.
[00:04:59] You've run businesses and also worked in various aspects of real estate.
[00:05:04] So just walk us through how you got involved.
[00:05:07] By complete accident.
[00:05:09] So after law school, I was a lawyer that went into and I really wanted to be a developer.
[00:05:20] That was where my thought my calling was.
[00:05:22] In fact, I as a young boy, I really enjoyed going on vacations.
[00:05:27] My family was a middle class family.
[00:05:31] And so we would go on car trips and a lot of plane trips.
[00:05:39] Occasionally, we would stay at a decent hotel, never real luxury stuff.
[00:05:45] That was not within my family's means.
[00:05:49] And I wanted to build hotels.
[00:05:52] I thought that was really cool.
[00:05:54] People like love going to hotels.
[00:05:56] And I thought it wouldn't be great to be a developer of some luxury hotels.
[00:06:03] And at the time I got out of law school, the commercial real estate industry was, you know, interest rates were hovering around 20%.
[00:06:12] It was just not a great time to be in the building business.
[00:06:15] And so I got some great advices.
[00:06:17] And you want to be a lawyer and help developers from a legal side and then learn the business.
[00:06:23] And then once the market is better, then you can, you know, actually move to the business side.
[00:06:28] I never intended to be a lawyer long term ever.
[00:06:32] And I got into this law firm and by chance, I'm sure by chance that they were a really good real estate specialty.
[00:06:38] And that's what I wanted to do.
[00:06:40] They operated the legal hotline for the Washington Association of Realters.
[00:06:45] And, you know, for those agents that watch, they know that in many states, there is a legal hotline where you can call and get, you know, answers to your questions, etc.
[00:06:55] And so this law firm basically had the contract for providing the legal hotline.
[00:07:01] And as the newbie, I, that became part of my job.
[00:07:05] You got to be the guy that answered the phones.
[00:07:07] I got to be the guy that answered the phones.
[00:07:09] And so, and initially I thought, come on, this is not, I'm not building hotels here.
[00:07:17] I'm talking to real stories, right?
[00:07:21] And yet I fell in love with it.
[00:07:22] I fell in love with the people in the industry.
[00:07:26] They are people that are glass half full people.
[00:07:33] They have to be because it's such a tough job.
[00:07:37] And they were so appreciative of information that we would give them.
[00:07:44] I would get calls many times before they would call their broker.
[00:07:48] They didn't want their broker to know that they sold the house twice.
[00:07:52] Or, or, you know, other really challenging scenarios.
[00:07:57] And, and I just fell in love with the business.
[00:08:00] I fell in love with the people.
[00:08:02] All those things.
[00:08:03] And so that was sort of an entree.
[00:08:06] It's sort of diverted the path.
[00:08:08] And then this law firm also did a lot of work representing REALTOR associations and multiple listing services and brokerage companies.
[00:08:16] And, and I just, my, my career just fell into that path.
[00:08:20] And that's sort of it just, you know, sometimes you get into a stream and it takes you downstream.
[00:08:26] And you don't really decide to go there.
[00:08:29] It just takes you there.
[00:08:30] And I'm really fortunate that I've had a wonderful career that didn't end up being a hotel developer.
[00:08:38] And, and I practice law for about 10 years.
[00:08:41] And then I during the time when the internet actually became something of a commercial medium.
[00:08:50] I was became fascinated.
[00:08:52] I had a brother who was very much on the technology side.
[00:08:55] And he kept on sending me things.
[00:08:56] And I just, I couldn't get enough of where I thought this thing called the internet was going to be the 90s, right?
[00:09:06] And I started developing a specialty around data licensing.
[00:09:12] And it was wet at the time when multiple listing services.
[00:09:16] So Realtor.com started, you know, it came on to the scene.
[00:09:21] I mean, homes.com cyber homes.
[00:09:24] If people remember that, I mean, just ride the initials of portals.
[00:09:28] And they were going to the MLS is in seeking to license data.
[00:09:32] And MLS is at the time.
[00:09:34] And many of them were still operating off literally computers in big rooms as opposed to the PC, right?
[00:09:42] And so this was, you know, a long time ago, relatively speaking.
[00:09:46] And they didn't really understand IP intellectual property and what it meant to date license data and all that.
[00:09:52] And so I became that guy.
[00:09:55] I started doing work for MLS is across the country and helping them license their data.
[00:10:01] And I remember I was at one of the very first in-man conferences late 90s.
[00:10:05] And I was doing a speech on data and IP and real estate.
[00:10:13] And there were some guys in the audience that were running a little startup company in Seattle.
[00:10:18] They had gone down to San Francisco.
[00:10:20] And they heard me talk.
[00:10:22] And when I got back, I got a phone call from them.
[00:10:24] They said, hey, you know, where's the Microsoft developers were building this new application.
[00:10:28] It was one of the very first virtual tour applications.
[00:10:32] And they said, we need, we need some help, right?
[00:10:35] We, we, we, we not build a great technology, but we don't, don't really understand this real estate world.
[00:10:39] And so I started being their lawyer.
[00:10:43] And then shortly thereafter, I got so enamored with what they were doing and the opportunity to build some really cool technology that I jumped from my law firm became CEO of this little startup company.
[00:10:56] And we did the whole startup thing and eventually failed.
[00:10:59] We, we, we, we almost got bought by one of the big players, but NASDAQ and, and the crash of NASDAQ really took the sales out of that process and learned a ton about technology development, learned a ton about bringing product to this industry.
[00:11:18] And then we, some great lessons learned, even though we ended up failing as a startup wouldn't trade it for the world.
[00:11:28] It's helping me today, learning going through the things we went back literally 20 years ago.
[00:11:35] And, and I don't know all the right answers, but one thing that experience does is it tells you what alleys not to go down, right? And because if you go down that alley, you're going to get beat up, right?
[00:11:47] So, so the wisdom that I learned is is what not to do.
[00:11:52] There's still a lot of learnings about what to do in a very dynamic environment.
[00:11:57] From there, I went back into the broken side and my career eventually took me into organized real estate with the Missouri Association of Realters and, and then back in 2014,
[00:12:14] Zillow was really making some headway against Rosa dot com, Rosa dot com went from the number one portal to the number three portal.
[00:12:20] I remember behind, yeah, behind Zillow and Trulia and, and some major execs left Zillow and went to, or left REALTOR dot com went to Zillow and that opened up a spot to come in and, and so I joined REALTOR dot com and, and at a time when they were going through some changes and being acquired by
[00:12:42] Rupert Murdock and, and, and that organization and learned a lot again from a from a technology portal standpoint leads and, and all that.
[00:12:53] And then left REALTOR dot com and got the chance to help eXp in the initial growth phase of the company, which was tremendously exciting and interesting eXp is a great company.
[00:13:07] You know, bringing a new model to real estate and the challenges around that, again, another great learning opportunity and eventually left them and took some time off and, and got rejuvenated and then got this opportunity to come to collaborate and build what we think is a is a truly groundbreaking application for helping real estate agents be better marketers.
[00:13:35] I'm really excited to dive into that. I did want to touch since you you were, you know, part of eXp and, and helping them in, and really in their growth phase, which seems like they're always in growth phase and they have just been skyrocketing, but that is a true success story.
[00:13:51] I mean, I am, weren't independent brokerage here in Chicago, so we're not affiliated with any one, but when we have about 800 agents or so here, and I know how long it took us to build that and I, if I had one regret it was boy, I wish I would have come up with the eXp model before eXp because boy, are they just taking the ball and running with it basically the way I understand eXp's models, they took what Keller Williams had attempted to do in the past, but didn't.
[00:14:21] Quite have it fleshed out the same sort of program, this idea of having a down line and having agents kind of underneath you and really just leaning into that model and realizing what eXp realized, I think that no other brokerage realized is that they leaned into this whole influence or kind of idea where people can build these online presences on YouTube on tick tock and really become this broker that or agent that other agents follow and then that draws people in.
[00:14:51] I've interviewed some eXp agents, I've had them on my show who have like a thousand plus team members because they're a real popular person online and they provide all this value to other agents and then agents sign up on it is really an incredible thing that sort of caught fire and I've always thought eXp is really a B2B brand, a business to business and not really a B2C brand.
[00:15:14] I don't think they care that much about the consumer because they focus all of their effort for their marketing on the B2B side which again it's just such a brilliant idea.
[00:15:25] My hats off to them, I think eXp does some really really neat things and they've really caught lightning in a bottle I think very impressively.
[00:15:33] Yeah, you know the model, what eXp is a perfect example of is how timing is so incredibly important to the effectiveness of model.
[00:15:49] So Glenn actually started eXp in 2009, I think 2008, 2009 and I make Glenn when I was at Realtor.com I ran what was called our broker advisory board and Glenn was on that board which was kind of weird because not that Glenn is not a smart guy but you know we had you know the biggest companies in the country on our brokerage right towards them we had this A eXp which was at the time 500 agents in the kind of a lot of things.
[00:16:19] So even the model of the company was a big company, but they had a lot of things that they could have an odd model nobody got you know yeah nobody really understood it yeah.
[00:16:23] You did, right and so eXp really kind of bumped around for about six seven years before a variety of things came together and the model took off and it was right place, right time for that model to come to the industry when the industry was looking for an alternative to agents were looking for an alternative to the industry.
[00:16:49] So I think it's a very important alternative with give me multiple streams of income give me autonomy it's not about your brand is about my brand my my brand the agent all those things leveraging a digital environment their eXp world as and using the savings from that to be able to fund these alternatives streams of income better you know revenue share model versus profit share model of KW stock you know all those things we're groundbreaking right ground breaking and
[00:17:19] and it was just a perfect storm in a good way a good storm for the for the folks at the eXp that really got it going and they continue to do quite well.
[00:17:31] It's funny to say that the timing thing so we're at our brokerage here in Chicago and I know we're getting a little into the weeds but just for people I think this is kind of interesting for them to hear and then we'll dive really deep into into marketing and branding but
[00:17:44] so we're a hundred percent firm which which just means we have a transaction fee versus splits for for our brokers and we've made friends with pretty much all the big hundred percent firms all over the country and we sort of do a little these mastermind meetings and what we found funny enough from talking to all these these big 100% firms is that usually almost in almost every case they were first to market they were just happened to be the first one in their city to to do it and so you're right it's same with us I would
[00:18:13] love to say that we are so brilliant that we had this thought and we executed it and the reality of it was it was perfect timing we just got we got lucky and you know it's well you know I wouldn't say you got lucky I say you you I mean I think luck is a is a function of of strategy right and effort yeah and and effort you put your you make your luck and so you got 100% agree I just mean the timing was
[00:18:43] very fortunate had we done it six months before or after might have had a different result so sometimes the timing timing works out but you're right it's ultimately it's a marathon not a sprint but anyway let's talk about
[00:18:58] sphere builder because I am a big believer and I'm quoting one of our frequent guests on our show Ryan de april so I don't want to steal his words but it's probably not probably not even his initial words but he's something he
[00:19:11] professors to all of his agents which is your network your net worth is or your network is your net worth right so the idea that your sphere is really where you're going to build your business maintain your
[00:19:23] business that is your asset or and so this idea of deep sort of figuring out how to further deepen those relationships create more bonds more
[00:19:35] connection is only going to help grow the business but you need help to do that and that's what you guys do so let's let's talk about
[00:19:41] sphere builder yeah so sphere builder is and I will talk about the application but I want to talk more about sort of this this movement that we're
[00:19:52] trying to create around this idea of building a digital sphere and it's got sort of multi facets to it the first is that at
[00:20:02] to your point agents when you go into room if you say to a group of agents do you have a sphere one they all they all say yes I've got
[00:20:13] yeah and they know what it is right and they know it is because it's so important to their business and and you know just this last week some data came out
[00:20:26] Zillow now owns 50% of the search market and and when you look at 98% of search is owned by big portals and by some large brokerage
[00:20:39] companies only 2% is owned by the rest of the entire rest of the industry right it used to be that and what is
[00:20:48] searches today's version of the Sunday paper from 20 years ago yeah that that acted as a place where people could get
[00:20:58] outreach to or from and and so the industry whether it's right or wrong lost the search battle it's gone
[00:21:10] it's now owned by other people that you know the traditional industry view as non-traditionalists
[00:21:15] um so the question is does that mean that the industry is um subservient to those folks and the answer is no
[00:21:25] because the sphere who agents um uh know in their local communities um their local presence
[00:21:36] uh cannot be matched by a portal um and and it's that group of people that no like and we talked about
[00:21:44] us all that but no like and trust the agent um you're walking down the street you're in your local
[00:21:49] environment and and you're the expert um you're the influencer in your local community and and yet when
[00:21:57] we talk about spheres of influence most agents are really able to talk about how that sphere works in
[00:22:04] real life you know the 100 or 200 people that are in their in their quote unquote rola dex or a CRM that
[00:22:10] if they walked down the street and bumped into them they they could have a conversation um but what
[00:22:16] we've seen is that today with the emergence of the digital world social channels um google all those
[00:22:26] things there is another sphere of influence and that's what we call the digital sphere of influence
[00:22:32] and we believe uh and our data shows that the tools and strategies and tactics used to build your
[00:22:41] sphere in real life where you are engaged your personality comes out all those things
[00:22:49] are different than the tools and tactics and strategies that are that are necessary to build
[00:22:54] your digital sphere and yet that digital sphere the breadth and the scope of that sphere can be
[00:23:00] 10 100 1000 x the number of people that can be in your real life sphere and and can do the sit
[00:23:08] but can do the same thing it can create that no like trust relationship um that that does not
[00:23:17] reliant on search engines or portals or paid lead gen or all that to generate a great
[00:23:24] word of mouth referrals and at the end of the day um the the best and most sustainable businesses
[00:23:30] in real estate operate off those word of mouth referrals and and repeat business
[00:23:37] so if i just to recap what you said because you said a lot and and i want to make sure that i
[00:23:42] i caught it correctly um this idea of having a digital sphere will say is uh we can get the same
[00:23:50] results as a in person sphere we'll call it we'll just i'll just use in person and digital as
[00:23:55] opposites um and in person sphere we we we know we we understand that we we understand the value
[00:24:02] of that we we also know that there's a value to the digital sphere what what i guess the distinction
[00:24:07] we're making is that both can get you incredible results but with the on the digital side number one
[00:24:14] your reach is exponential because of course the way that technology uh connects us uh the
[00:24:19] social is obviously apparent to everyone but also the techniques or the practices to cultivate
[00:24:26] the digital sphere is going to be a different set of practices or or the some degree different
[00:24:32] than what you might do in person to develop those relationships that that's correct and and and most
[00:24:39] agents today do a very poor job of being a digital marketer now and i want to and i want to um
[00:24:49] and it's not because they're not able to i mean they're not they're certainly capable they just
[00:24:53] haven't learned the tools and the techniques in order to do that right i was laughing because i put
[00:24:58] myself in the poor digital marketing category as well so i i i i'm one of i'm one i am one of
[00:25:05] me i am just like the listeners well and you have lots of friends so so don't don't feel alone in
[00:25:10] that in that category um and it's important that um one thing that we what one of our monitors is this
[00:25:18] in in every organization there is a sales function there's a sales department and there's a marketing
[00:25:25] department and they're different they're they're managed by different talent sets the the deliverables
[00:25:34] are different sales is about lead gen and conversion and the driving of revenue and marketing is about
[00:25:42] positioning and branding and and creating a a fertile ground for the sales people to to work off of
[00:25:51] they work synergistically and collectively together toward the same result but they're fundamentally
[00:25:56] different functions in any organization um a real estate agent is an organization it's a business
[00:26:03] right and and what we believe is that um and it's it's it's a sales business so the people that come
[00:26:11] into it tend to be great on the sales side they know how to lead generate they're good at it um
[00:26:18] it's you know the technology tools that have been built today are focused on lead generation if you
[00:26:23] go to any Facebook group and you talk about you throw out the word lead gen you've got people from
[00:26:28] a variety of different perspectives talking about the best the next the coolest the newest lead
[00:26:34] generation scenario um big companies talk about the leverage of lead gen lead gen lead gen
[00:26:40] all great but lead gen without marketing sales without marketing is only half of the equation
[00:26:49] and and so um our perspective in our technology is designed to help agents not be better lead
[00:26:57] generators there's plenty of stuff out there to be lead generates but to actually help agents be
[00:27:02] better digital marketers and and that's what we're trying to solve with sphere builder um because
[00:27:09] we want the business to come to agents through building of great spheres as opposed to an agent
[00:27:14] having to go cultivate that business through lead generation interesting so how do how do you do that
[00:27:21] well um first of all the the cool thing about the digital sphere um and a digital agents online
[00:27:28] presence is it's measurable with data um we can actually look and we have a tool called sphere index
[00:27:39] it's the first uh tool of its kind it's uh groundbreaking it's a real-time analytics tool where an agent
[00:27:48] will come in and provide to us um their social handles their google business profile there's
[00:27:54] zill review page variety of places where they show up online they give us those public profiles
[00:28:00] and then we have uh an application that goes out and essentially crawls those sites takes looks at
[00:28:09] the at the public accessible data we don't look at private stuff we're just looking at what anybody
[00:28:13] would see if if if I went to your um your Facebook page or your Instagram page we have a we have a
[00:28:21] way to to look at that we capture it and then we run it through an algorithm um that basically measures
[00:28:29] and puts different um um i'll call it emphasis on certain activities and then we come up with a
[00:28:36] score and that's what we call our sphere index score it takes about three minutes it's free um and
[00:28:43] and it's it's the first like I said real-time scoring mechanism of an agent's digital presence
[00:28:49] it's important that when you begin a digital marketing journey you begin with a baseline
[00:28:55] because what happened what's happening in the industry today agents will go to our conference or
[00:29:00] they'll see something on Facebook or they'll go to a um they'll watch somebody somewhere and they
[00:29:06] say you should do this and so they'll throw that piece of spaghetti at the wall and then it won't
[00:29:11] generate immediate results they go that didn't work and then they'll go see somebody else saying
[00:29:15] something else and they go they'll take that other piece of I'm an Italian guy so you know the
[00:29:20] it won't be spaghetti it'll be rigatoni they'll throw rigatoni at the wall right um and and that
[00:29:26] didn't work right that didn't produce a lead oh shoot um then they'll see somebody else and they'll
[00:29:31] say well that's some vermicelli and then throw throw some vermicelli at the wall and then
[00:29:35] and so there's constantly throwing things at the wall we want to get them off of that um
[00:29:41] of that treadmill and say look it let's look at where you are let's measure it let's measure it
[00:29:48] against a benchmark and this is the cool thing that we developed um we have what's called a local
[00:29:54] pro benchmark and the idea is that and and if you go to our site you'll see um we we we essentially
[00:30:01] create a score zero to 100 as to how effective an agent is in their digital marketing presence
[00:30:08] but if we just said to you DJ your score is 45 you're gonna go great what does that mean
[00:30:16] well honestly it means nothing because there's no relevancy to it there's no comparison to it
[00:30:21] so what we do when we go into a local market and we we launched this application first in
[00:30:26] in Denver and Huntsville just a couple weeks ago and it's going to be going nationwide um we go
[00:30:31] and create we actually look at top producers so in Denver and Huntsville we went out and collected
[00:30:38] data around the top uh five percent of agents in those two market areas by volume production these
[00:30:45] are the agents that are doing production right um and we ran all those agents through our algorithm
[00:30:52] and we then developed a score that reflects how those agents are doing digital marketing
[00:30:58] what is their what are their Facebook profiles look like what does their Instagram profiles look
[00:31:02] like how do they show up on on Zillow how many reviews do they have all those things do they have a
[00:31:07] Google profile what's on their Google profile what are their reviews on in Google or Facebook or
[00:31:12] Instagram a massive amount of data and we created a score that basically is this benchmark that says
[00:31:19] if you're a top producer in these markets your marketing looks like up 72 okay now when I say to DJ
[00:31:27] you're 45 yeah you say okay I'm a 45 compared to people that are in the top five percent of the
[00:31:34] industry doing 72 and we want you to the next question to be how do I get better how do I actually
[00:31:43] get from 45 to 72 and we patterned the application off of a very popular consumer application called
[00:31:51] credit karma I'm not sure if you're a user credit karma but we we love it and credit karma basically
[00:31:58] gives consumers a credit score and and says okay you're a 675 right well good you need to get to 700
[00:32:08] to be good and if you want to get to excellent maybe you want to be to 800 and then they take you through
[00:32:13] this prescriptive journey in doing things to help you have a better credit score and as you do those
[00:32:20] things when you go back to credit karma your 675 just became 700 and then it became 725 it became 750
[00:32:27] and now you have this this scoring incentive around your credit score that that helps you go through
[00:32:34] this this journey right because it's not a 90 day get fit quick scenario it's a journey it's a long
[00:32:43] term approach and so we say credit karma is for consumers on their credit journey as sphere builder
[00:32:51] is for real estate agents on their digital marketing journey so we start with a score and then we create
[00:32:58] what we call recommendation cards and we help agents based upon their data not other people's data
[00:33:04] their data how they can improve their profiles how they can create content both non-listing and
[00:33:11] listing content to create more engagement more followers to build it and over time as we remasier
[00:33:17] them that's that for your 45 will become a 50 and the 55 and the 60 and all of a sudden you're
[00:33:24] going to be at 70 which is similar to a benchmark and we've seen a tight correlation between digital
[00:33:30] marketing activities and production so as there's a positive correlation then between the score as it
[00:33:38] rises you're seeing income production volume increase as a result of tightening up some of the
[00:33:47] practices you know this is this is very very interesting because it's it's it's so it's so
[00:33:54] interesting so I you know talk about measuring and we don't really measure social
[00:34:02] engagements as a whole or sorry sorry I just say digital marketing we'll just say we don't
[00:34:07] really measure it we measure it in little silos right we say well we did this one post and here's
[00:34:12] here the results and I like it or I don't like it or here's what I need to fix for the next time
[00:34:17] and then over time you can maybe start to see some trends in videos that are produced or static images
[00:34:23] that you're throwing up on Instagram Facebook TikTok even and you can start to start to figure out
[00:34:30] what your audience is into but what what you guys have done is actually say we're gonna actually
[00:34:36] we're gonna actually benchmark the most successful agents in your area and kind of show you what they're
[00:34:42] doing and guide you from where you are today almost like a credit card repairing your credit score
[00:34:49] repairing your social media credit score over time and as you increase we're gonna be checking to
[00:34:56] make sure it's going up and you just gonna do these several things that we're gonna suggest to you
[00:35:01] and then you're going to get the results of that I mean it's it's a very simple idea but it is it
[00:35:06] is brilliant in a way because it really does it's like you know I can step on the scale every day
[00:35:11] and it'll tell me how what my actual weight is and it might also tell me my body fat and whatever
[00:35:17] metrics it it measures but if I only look at that weight measurement I don't really know what that
[00:35:23] tells me right it tells me what my overall weight is but it's not particularly helpful to to know if
[00:35:28] I'm healthy or not I mean yes it would tell me if I'm overweight or underweight but other than
[00:35:33] that it's kind of like what do you do with that and what do you want it to be and that's where
[00:35:37] people then go to personal trainers or dietitians or people that can actually make sense of this
[00:35:42] this information and say here's where you really want to be and here's how to get there I love the
[00:35:46] fact that you guys are like a prescriptive kind of service where it's like you know we're gonna
[00:35:51] we're gonna you're gonna go see the doctor we're gonna give you your weight and then we're gonna
[00:35:54] tell you what you need to do to to get to get you know more fit so to speak in the digital marketing
[00:36:00] space super exciting and I don't to my knowledge I don't know of any company that's that's currently
[00:36:06] doing that for REALTORS no we're we are the first you know we won't be the last I mean every good
[00:36:13] idea has other folks that want to replicate it but we are the first real time analytics and and
[00:36:22] marketing platform that you know there are some things that we do that other people do nobody
[00:36:27] has put the package together and what we've found is that REALTORS don't they want easy and they want
[00:36:38] things to be very intuitive and one thing we've done in the design process is try to put everything
[00:36:45] in one platform so an agent you know is not having to navigate from one platform to another platform
[00:36:52] to you know log in log out log in log out the hope is that this becomes their digital marketing platform
[00:37:00] you know we have content creation opportunities it's it's very canva-like in from a content creation
[00:37:09] standpoint we connect to an MLS and so the moment an agent takes a listing that listing shows up in our
[00:37:18] in our in our applications so an agent can then create marketing materials around that listing
[00:37:24] we have both an organic sharing function so we can take content and seamlessly if you've got multiple
[00:37:32] social channels with one click share that content out in one click in a very effective way and we
[00:37:39] also have an advertising platform obviously organic sharing is great because it helps your current
[00:37:45] followers know that you're doing things but if you want to grow your sphere you've got to advertise
[00:37:51] you've got to reach new people with new content and and so our system essentially replaces
[00:37:57] replaces Facebook ads manager which is for most agents a nightmare and now you could take content
[00:38:04] that's created in the platform and with a couple of clicks get advertising campaigns created
[00:38:09] so it's designed to be kind of a one-stop shop that begins it's wrapped around data and analytics and
[00:38:15] and that's the thing that we as we were idating around the idea we actually went out to this industry
[00:38:25] called martec marketing technology it's a $500 billion worldwide industry and we looked at
[00:38:30] martec applications outside of the real estate industry so now we'll real estate was doing but what other
[00:38:38] B2B and B2C companies were doing with martec and the two things we found that
[00:38:45] really kind of drove how we ideated around the technology was one automation was critical right
[00:38:54] and and today automation is very possible and and quite frankly it's going to become even
[00:39:03] more interesting with the chat gpt stuff and then analytics and let's we're interwoven with all of
[00:39:13] the automation and drove with with data and machine learning the ability to to be smart
[00:39:20] automators and so we're bringing those two things together in an application the the metaphor
[00:39:28] that we use internally is we built an iceberg we want agents to see the tip top of it above the
[00:39:34] water that's beautiful and easy and to navigate around but underneath it is a massive amount of
[00:39:41] of application data and and tools that the agent will never see but will help them be better at
[00:39:50] at this marketing game i i think that's great this idea of just getting a score there used to be
[00:39:58] a social score service that was popular about 15 years ago and i can't recall the name it is
[00:40:05] clout yes with a k clout with a k uh and and thank you that is a thank you and and if anyone
[00:40:13] who's listing remembers clout you would get a score and you wouldn't know what to do with it you
[00:40:19] would see it and you would go okay i'm a 77 or whatever it was and you're like i don't know what
[00:40:24] that means um right and and and they never figured out what to do with the number and i don't know
[00:40:34] the business yeah yeah yeah they they they had a really neat idea the metric of it and then they
[00:40:40] weren't able to say well here's here's how to improve that score um that's what you guys are
[00:40:45] essentially doing and at which i absolutely love so what are some of the lessons you've learned
[00:40:52] from studying some of these top producers in the various markets that you guys have explored
[00:40:57] what are some of the things they're doing well on on social or digital marketing um
[00:41:03] any suggestions just overall suggestions that you or even mistakes that you see agents making
[00:41:09] well um we talked about the mistakes let's talk about the successes because it's a far more
[00:41:13] positive thing right um we actually as we're building the application we said you know there's
[00:41:21] there's a bunch there's people out there that are being successful in this digital marketing
[00:41:26] endeavors and we need to go out and find them and do some research around them and
[00:41:32] and bring their stories to the rest of the industry and so we spent months researching and writing
[00:41:40] a industry paper that you mentioned thank you at the beginning of the show um you can you can go to
[00:41:45] it at sirbuilder.io and and navigate to the paper and and download it um it's about an 18 page it's
[00:41:53] not it's not a two-page or it's a very in-depth paper it's a deep dive it's a deep dive it's a
[00:41:59] worthy read it's everybody should go go to spherebuilder.io and scroll to the bottom or you'll
[00:42:07] you'll see it's actually right at the top put in your information you you're going to want to read this
[00:42:12] and we we found I mean there's we we found many we can only highlight four um uh
[00:42:21] Nikki Bochamp um Stacy Stobb, Pinky Benson, Brad Allen, a couple of folks run brokerage companies,
[00:42:28] some are individual agents um different parts of the country doing things all incredibly successful
[00:42:36] all very successful but doing things differently and and so the first learning is that there
[00:42:43] there is no one-size-fits-all approach uh and and we don't um when we talk about being
[00:42:49] prescriptive we don't tell agents this is who you need to be online the the thing that stood out
[00:42:56] with all of these folks and I think if you were if they were your guests they would say there's
[00:43:02] an authenticity that comes through in who they uh purport to be online because again think about this
[00:43:12] in this in the sphere building in real life you meet somebody in your church group or your kids'
[00:43:20] soccer team or whatever environment and and it's you and them and and your personality and who you
[00:43:28] are is coming through um well now you've got to replicate that in an online digital environment where
[00:43:37] you've got to provide snippets of of information about who you are and what makes you you
[00:43:43] and and everybody's different and unique and so um what we found is that they all approached
[00:43:50] both the platforms that they used that they relied on some were heavy YouTube others heavy
[00:43:56] Instagram others heavy Facebook some Twitter others combination of all the all the of the above
[00:44:03] and more tiktok um find the platforms that you really want to excel on that matches who you are
[00:44:10] and the method and that you want to share content and then the the second piece is be consistent
[00:44:19] and um over time because this is not a 90 day diet you're not going to become a successful
[00:44:26] digital marketer by approaching it with a 90 day lead gen mentality you won't so you might as well
[00:44:32] not do it it's like it's like going on um you know a 90 day diet you may lose weight right and
[00:44:39] that 90 diet but guess what if you don't change your lifestyle that weight's going to come right back
[00:44:44] on yeah um you can you can fix your credit score um and yet if you go back to the same spending
[00:44:50] patterns your credit score is going to go right back to where it is and the same analogy holds
[00:44:55] through for digital marketing if you don't build a sustainable approach to developing the no-like
[00:45:03] trust persona online then you you you may make short term inroads but long term if you're in this
[00:45:11] business for the long term and that's who our customer is what we're not and you know I hate to
[00:45:17] say this but we really don't want to serve agents who are in in the business to make a quick buck
[00:45:23] that's not who we're marketing to we want agents that are serious about being real estate professionals
[00:45:29] um a lot of the quick buck agents are leaving the business because it's not as easy to make that
[00:45:34] quick buck anymore right and so we want to help those agents that truly love this business
[00:45:39] our professionals do great service for their clients and need help being better marketers and the
[00:45:46] four people that we highlighted in the paper I think are great lessons for agents and you're
[00:45:52] you know watching this podcast to go and read about how they're approaching this marketing
[00:45:57] approach and being very successful at it in different ways yeah so walk me through so let's say
[00:46:03] I sign up I submit my my social channels to to you guys you you start um which by the way you
[00:46:11] you can do for free um you can go to their the website again also to check out the white paper
[00:46:17] sphere builder dot i.o is where you can go to do this but anyway let's say I sign up I submit my
[00:46:23] my social accounts to to your team you start to analyze it you assign me a social score relative to
[00:46:31] the you know an agent in my agents in my market who are who are do have a strong digital presence
[00:46:37] as well as a strong uh business um and so now I know where I'm at where some people I might aspire
[00:46:44] to be are at then how do you help get me from here to there so we have these recommendation cards
[00:46:51] and so we've analyzed your data and for example we will analyze your social profiles um there's a
[00:46:58] ton of information on your social profiles that um it's important to be consistent in how you
[00:47:05] provide that information and a lot of agents are are not consistent the first thing I will tell you is
[00:47:10] that um we ask you whether you have a Google business profile um if you do not have a Google
[00:47:15] business profile you will not score well in our in our system because if you don't have a Google
[00:47:19] business profile Google in in Google search how somebody's going to find you um they they punish you
[00:47:26] right um in from a search algorithm standpoint so the very first thing we will say is get your
[00:47:33] Google profile and and we provide a link to go do that um we also analyze the the data that's on
[00:47:39] your profile so if you don't have a website link there if you don't have a phone number
[00:47:42] if the information is not consistent we we show that to you again lots of agents um maybe got
[00:47:49] their Google profile Google business profile three years ago and then move brokerage companies
[00:47:53] well guess what they probably still have some of their same they haven't updated it so there's
[00:47:58] somebody who goes to Google profile Google business profile sees brokerage information from three
[00:48:03] years ago well that's not good right and and so consumers are smart especially the younger consumers
[00:48:10] they they stock agents right before they make that phone call reach out they're looking at your
[00:48:16] online presence and if they see inconsistent um profile information that's a sign that you are not
[00:48:24] on top of how you present yourself to them how well are you going to be on top of presenting their
[00:48:30] property in a listing right it means something to consumers today so we go through that process
[00:48:36] and then we start analyzing you know what is your follower base how engaged are your followers how
[00:48:43] often are you posting what are the posts doing for you and then we help you uh get better at that
[00:48:49] through content uh both listing content not listing content um it's it's not hard it's just
[00:48:58] something that requires a bit of training and we want to make it fun at the same time right so
[00:49:03] hopefully the fun comes in and in seeing that score tick up as you do these things uh and hopefully
[00:49:10] generates some business in in the uh in the context and you can see this this uh we call a virtuous
[00:49:16] cycle of um of of feedback that breeds activity more good feedback more good activity it's like
[00:49:24] getting on I mean you're an allergy to stepping on the scale if you if you're if you're trying to
[00:49:29] lose weight and you step on the scale in the morning and you see that you're two pounds lighter
[00:49:33] you're going to be psyched to go on that evening run right that's true and and and that's what we
[00:49:38] want to create that that measurement over time is that uh dopamine hit that we want to deliver to
[00:49:46] the age to keep them on the train down this path I I think that is so well said it really you're
[00:49:52] coaching company of sorts but in a different way you're a digital coaching company in the sense that
[00:49:58] and an analytics company I I don't I don't want to lump you in with with all the other coaching
[00:50:03] programs out there because that's not really what you you do but in a sense you are consulting firm
[00:50:08] I guess maybe that's a better way to say it because what what you're doing is you say give us all
[00:50:12] your dad not not all your dad are but all your social uh channels so we can analyze the data and we can
[00:50:17] take a look and see what works what isn't working where there's room for improvement and then come
[00:50:22] back and say hey by the way we noticed your LinkedIn hasn't been updated in three years and it's
[00:50:26] still showing you with your previous firm um by the way your your your Zillow you have three different
[00:50:30] Zillow profiles they're all over the place uh we need to get all of this working cohesively because
[00:50:36] we don't know where someone's going to look for information for you but certainly Google you know
[00:50:42] is is is Google my business for example uh is is a place that that you know people don't think about
[00:50:48] but of course we all utilize when we're searching for for local things so the idea is you guys are
[00:50:54] going to give suggestions and not just you know top 10 things to do to get your digital marketing
[00:50:59] health in order but really saying very prescriptively here's based on what you're currently doing and
[00:51:06] we've analyzed everything here's what the exact steps you mr. missus agent need to take
[00:51:10] yeah so two things i want to want to clarify one is is we are not we're a SaaS technology company
[00:51:17] so we don't provide managed services we don't charge agents for talking to a human that is that's
[00:51:25] not what we're about in fact um we we want to support coaching organizations um our application
[00:51:31] would be a great i mean if you're a coaching organization you should call us and here's why
[00:51:35] because today you have zero ability because i don't think you have our tool it took us
[00:51:43] um a long time and a lot of engineering to build the tool that we have um we can help you help your
[00:51:51] clients if you're a coach understand their their digital presence and manage it over time to the
[00:51:58] extent that there's specific things that that a coaching organization is helping their agents or
[00:52:03] their their clients do we don't want to replace that we want to augment that right and so really
[00:52:10] there's a place there's a really uh synergistic place for us to work with coaching organizations
[00:52:16] because of the approach that we take to data analytics so that's that's number one um and and
[00:52:22] you know number two is um you know in terms of of um right now we're we're i want to make sure that
[00:52:31] we're clear with your viewers uh we're in Denver and Huntsville today um we're going to be doing a
[00:52:39] national launch um in the next quarter uh and available um to agents around the country um so
[00:52:49] there's a place on our website that if you're interested in this technology you can let us know
[00:52:55] and um part of of us developing why it's so slow to roll out is we need MLS data right and uh and
[00:53:05] and MLS you know working with MLS is they're great to work with but they're not the speediest
[00:53:09] organizations in the world um and so um we'd love to if if there's an MLS listing to this we'd love
[00:53:15] to talk with you because um these are this is the kind of application that um we're the partnership
[00:53:22] with an MLS we can bring it to all your agents and and get them going on the application
[00:53:26] and then finally the third thing i will say is um we've had really great conversations with brokerage
[00:53:32] companies who want to integrate the application as a productivity tool um we're being told by brokerage
[00:53:37] executives at agents especially today are looking for ways to build market share and you know back to
[00:53:47] my old business school days there was this old adage that in at the top of the cycle you drive revenue
[00:53:54] that's when you you put your foot on the on the gas pedal and you make as much money as you possibly
[00:54:00] can and at the bottom of the cycle you drive market share people are going out of business you capture
[00:54:07] their market share so that when the cycle recovers you can step on the gas pedal and so now is
[00:54:14] absolutely an art opinion and we're hearing it from brokerage companies executives as well
[00:54:18] is that we're in a down cycle nobody can change that right and and we know what will get better
[00:54:24] and the cycle will wrap up again now is when smart brokerage companies as smart agents will be
[00:54:31] building market share and there's no better way to do it than traditional marketing
[00:54:35] yeah this is the year to capture market share it is uh we again as Russ said we know there's been an
[00:54:40] Exodus uh uh started already uh we we also have a holding company for agents that don't actively
[00:54:46] practice and now it's the weirdest thing i never thought i would say this but our holding
[00:54:51] company actually has more agents than our actively producing company um they're not related they're
[00:54:56] separate entities but but we we never thought that this little holding company that we created
[00:55:01] would now have like 900 agents it's because uh the conditions of the market have changed and people
[00:55:06] are the ones e2z agents um the the part timers are starting to to exit and and uh sunset out
[00:55:13] and it's a great time for agents to pick up market share this year so this is a good time to get
[00:55:19] your digital marketing health uh in order um and and you know again i i i always i have this fantasy
[00:55:25] Russ it's so funny because what you guys uh person what you do in real estate is kind of the always
[00:55:32] the fantasy i have around the service providers in my life so like my accountant all i i mean i
[00:55:37] want my accountant to keep me out of prison and to make sure that i'm not being audited of course
[00:55:41] yes that's that's the job of the of the uh accountant but i what i would read my fantasy is that my
[00:55:48] accountant goes i have a few ideas for you this year right my accountant doesn't do that and i'm not
[00:55:54] disparage i'm not trying to say anything uh pejorative towards towards my account i love my accountant
[00:55:58] but that would you know those are what what what i would be looking for i'd like to know you know
[00:56:03] here's what you could do to you know this next year to really increase uh you know your or decrease
[00:56:09] your tax exposure or whatever so basically you guys are prescriptive service and i love that and
[00:56:16] you're utilizing technology and and really you're not reinventing the wheel you're not saying well this
[00:56:20] is what we think works you're literally just going market by market and saying here's what the
[00:56:24] people in your market are doing and that and i understand also the challenge of connecting to all the
[00:56:30] MLS's to get this data uh i i can appreciate that all the MLS's have different apis they it's got to
[00:56:37] be a nightmare i i can't imagine what your engineers have to deal with there but um this is something
[00:56:42] that you definitely want to be on the waiting list for because once they do open up in your market
[00:56:46] place the top agents are going to subscribe to the service because it's the only one that exists
[00:56:51] out there so now's a great time to learn about it uh also learn some best practices if you read the white
[00:56:57] paper they have four case studies that are just incredible reads of really successful agents in four
[00:57:03] different markets and what they're doing digitally and they're doing things a little differently as
[00:57:06] Russ said and you can take some of their uh the the their suggestions and actually apply it to your
[00:57:13] own business but i want to know um are my digital marketing score as well so if you go to spherebuilder.io
[00:57:20] you can see the white paper you can uh get on their waiting list to see if when they open up in your
[00:57:26] our in your market and by the way if you're in Huntsville alabama or Denver and we have listeners
[00:57:31] i'm sure in both of those markets um we should reach out because they are basically almost good to go
[00:57:38] there so they are ready to launch um Russ is there anything else that that we should know about
[00:57:44] what the tool does uh no i think this has been a great conversation uh DJ and and and i think um
[00:57:52] uh we've we've covered um right place right time for a new piece of technology you know we
[00:58:01] we we know that agents are are inundated today with people looking for their attention um and uh
[00:58:10] and so this is something that um is is worth a few minutes of agents time to come in and investigate
[00:58:17] just the white paper in and of itself uh is is worthy of spending an hour with and reading it and
[00:58:25] uh and it will generate ideas for you even if you never use our technology uh or ever become a
[00:58:31] subscriber um you'll get some great ideas and you know we're a company um that is built with people
[00:58:40] who have been around the industry for a long time who support the industry we're not about
[00:58:46] disintermediating the REALTOR in fact we're about empowering the REALTOR i i i i as i said in the
[00:58:53] beginning i'd be i fell in love with the industry and the people in the industry 30 years ago and uh
[00:58:59] i think that um uh the united states needs effective REALTOR is helping consumers and this is
[00:59:07] just one way that we can help that process i i agree so everyone who is listening please

[00:59:37] association level great conversation to have that your next meetings with whatever committees you
[00:59:43] might be with it say hey this might be something we would want to bring to an association uh or
[00:59:48] an MLS directly as well so i imagine um that that could happen for you guys so that's very exciting

And I want you to put in your information to download their white paper specifically referencing and this is an incredible white paper about digital marketing use cases for real estate agents. You're going to see what top agents are currently doing to expand their digital presence and engagement and improve their business. Russ, welcome to the show. Thank you, DJ. Thanks for having me and looking forward to a great discussion about marketing for real estate agents. Yeah, let's dive into it. Normally, you've done everything in this industry. You've been on really all different sides of the business. I'd actually had loved it first before we get into marketing. We'd love to learn a little bit about your journey. How did you get involved in real estate? Obviously, you're an attorney. You've run businesses and also worked in various aspects of real estate. So just walk us through how you got involved. By complete accident. So after law school, I was a lawyer that went into and I really wanted to be a developer. That was where my thought my calling was. In fact, I as a young boy, I really enjoyed going on vacations. My family was a middle class family. And so we would go on car trips and a lot of plane trips. Occasionally, we would stay at a decent hotel, never real luxury stuff. That was not within my family's means. And I wanted to build hotels. I thought that was really cool. People like love going to hotels. And I thought it wouldn't be great to be a developer of some luxury hotels. And at the time I got out of law school, the commercial real estate industry was, you know, interest rates were hovering around 20%. It was just not a great time to be in the building business. And so I got some great advices. And you want to be a lawyer and help developers from a legal side and then learn the business. And then once the market is better, then you can, you know, actually move to the business side. I never intended to be a lawyer long term ever. And I got into this law firm and by chance, I'm sure by chance that they were a really good real estate specialty. And that's what I wanted to do. They operated the legal hotline for the Washington Association of Realters. And, you know, for those agents that watch, they know that in many states, there is a legal hotline where you can call and get, you know, answers to your questions, etc. And so this law firm basically had the contract for providing the legal hotline. And as the newbie, I, that became part of my job. You got to be the guy that answered the phones. I got to be the guy that answered the phones. And so, and initially I thought, come on, this is not, I'm not building hotels here. I'm talking to real stories, right? And yet I fell in love with it. I fell in love with the people in the industry. They are people that are glass half full people. They have to be because it's such a tough job. And they were so appreciative of information that we would give them. I would get calls many times before they would call their broker. They didn't want their broker to know that they sold the house twice. Or, or, you know, other really challenging scenarios. And, and I just fell in love with the business. I fell in love with the people. All those things. And so that was sort of an entree. It's sort of diverted the path. And then this law firm also did a lot of work representing REALTOR associations and multiple listing services and brokerage companies. And, and I just, my, my career just fell into that path. And that's sort of it just, you know, sometimes you get into a stream and it takes you downstream. And you don't really decide to go there. It just takes you there. And I'm really fortunate that I've had a wonderful career that didn't end up being a hotel developer. And, and I practice law for about 10 years. And then I during the time when the internet actually became something of a commercial medium. I was became fascinated. I had a brother who was very much on the technology side. And he kept on sending me things. And I just, I couldn't get enough of where I thought this thing called the internet was going to be the 90s, right? And I started developing a specialty around data licensing. And it was wet at the time when multiple listing services. So Realtor.com started, you know, it came on to the scene. I mean, homes.com cyber homes. If people remember that, I mean, just ride the initials of portals. And they were going to the MLS is in seeking to license data. And MLS is at the time. And many of them were still operating off literally computers in big rooms as opposed to the PC, right? And so this was, you know, a long time ago, relatively speaking. And they didn't really understand IP intellectual property and what it meant to date license data and all that. And so I became that guy. I started doing work for MLS is across the country and helping them license their data. And I remember I was at one of the very first in-man conferences late 90s. And I was doing a speech on data and IP and real estate. And there were some guys in the audience that were running a little startup company in Seattle. They had gone down to San Francisco. And they heard me talk. And when I got back, I got a phone call from them. They said, hey, you know, where's the Microsoft developers were building this new application. It was one of the very first virtual tour applications. And they said, we need, we need some help, right? We, we, we, we not build a great technology, but we don't, don't really understand this real estate world. And so I started being their lawyer. And then shortly thereafter, I got so enamored with what they were doing and the opportunity to build some really cool technology that I jumped from my law firm became CEO of this little startup company. And we did the whole startup thing and eventually failed. We, we, we, we almost got bought by one of the big players, but NASDAQ and, and the crash of NASDAQ really took the sales out of that process and learned a ton about technology development, learned a ton about bringing product to this industry. And then we, some great lessons learned, even though we ended up failing as a startup wouldn't trade it for the world. It's helping me today, learning going through the things we went back literally 20 years ago. And, and I don't know all the right answers, but one thing that experience does is it tells you what alleys not to go down, right? And because if you go down that alley, you're going to get beat up, right? So, so the wisdom that I learned is is what not to do. There's still a lot of learnings about what to do in a very dynamic environment. From there, I went back into the broken side and my career eventually took me into organized real estate with the Missouri Association of Realters and, and then back in 2014, Zillow was really making some headway against Rosa dot com, Rosa dot com went from the number one portal to the number three portal. I remember behind, yeah, behind Zillow and Trulia and, and some major execs left Zillow and went to, or left REALTOR dot com went to Zillow and that opened up a spot to come in and, and so I joined REALTOR dot com and, and at a time when they were going through some changes and being acquired by Rupert Murdock and, and, and that organization and learned a lot again from a from a technology portal standpoint leads and, and all that. And then left REALTOR dot com and got the chance to help eXp in the initial growth phase of the company, which was tremendously exciting and interesting eXp is a great company. You know, bringing a new model to real estate and the challenges around that, again, another great learning opportunity and eventually left them and took some time off and, and got rejuvenated and then got this opportunity to come to collaborate and build what we think is a is a truly groundbreaking application for helping real estate agents be better marketers. I'm really excited to dive into that. I did want to touch since you you were, you know, part of eXp and, and helping them in, and really in their growth phase, which seems like they're always in growth phase and they have just been skyrocketing, but that is a true success story. I mean, I am, weren't independent brokerage here in Chicago, so we're not affiliated with any one, but when we have about 800 agents or so here, and I know how long it took us to build that and I, if I had one regret it was boy, I wish I would have come up with the eXp model before eXp because boy, are they just taking the ball and running with it basically the way I understand eXp's models, they took what Keller Williams had attempted to do in the past, but didn't. Quite have it fleshed out the same sort of program, this idea of having a down line and having agents kind of underneath you and really just leaning into that model and realizing what eXp realized, I think that no other brokerage realized is that they leaned into this whole influence or kind of idea where people can build these online presences on YouTube on tick tock and really become this broker that or agent that other agents follow and then that draws people in. I've interviewed some eXp agents, I've had them on my show who have like a thousand plus team members because they're a real popular person online and they provide all this value to other agents and then agents sign up on it is really an incredible thing that sort of caught fire and I've always thought eXp is really a B2B brand, a business to business and not really a B2C brand. I don't think they care that much about the consumer because they focus all of their effort for their marketing on the B2B side which again it's just such a brilliant idea. My hats off to them, I think eXp does some really really neat things and they've really caught lightning in a bottle I think very impressively. Yeah, you know the model, what eXp is a perfect example of is how timing is so incredibly important to the effectiveness of model. So Glenn actually started eXp in 2009, I think 2008, 2009 and I make Glenn when I was at Realtor.com I ran what was called our broker advisory board and Glenn was on that board which was kind of weird because not that Glenn is not a smart guy but you know we had you know the biggest companies in the country on our brokerage right towards them we had this A eXp which was at the time 500 agents in the kind of a lot of things. So even the model of the company was a big company, but they had a lot of things that they could have an odd model nobody got you know yeah nobody really understood it yeah. You did, right and so eXp really kind of bumped around for about six seven years before a variety of things came together and the model took off and it was right place, right time for that model to come to the industry when the industry was looking for an alternative to agents were looking for an alternative to the industry. So I think it's a very important alternative with give me multiple streams of income give me autonomy it's not about your brand is about my brand my my brand the agent all those things leveraging a digital environment their eXp world as and using the savings from that to be able to fund these alternatives streams of income better you know revenue share model versus profit share model of KW stock you know all those things we're groundbreaking right ground breaking and and it was just a perfect storm in a good way a good storm for the for the folks at the eXp that really got it going and they continue to do quite well. It's funny to say that the timing thing so we're at our brokerage here in Chicago and I know we're getting a little into the weeds but just for people I think this is kind of interesting for them to hear and then we'll dive really deep into into marketing and branding but so we're a hundred percent firm which which just means we have a transaction fee versus splits for for our brokers and we've made friends with pretty much all the big hundred percent firms all over the country and we sort of do a little these mastermind meetings and what we found funny enough from talking to all these these big 100% firms is that usually almost in almost every case they were first to market they were just happened to be the first one in their city to to do it and so you're right it's same with us I would love to say that we are so brilliant that we had this thought and we executed it and the reality of it was it was perfect timing we just got we got lucky and you know it's well you know I wouldn't say you got lucky I say you you I mean I think luck is a is a function of of strategy right and effort yeah and and effort you put your you make your luck and so you got 100% agree I just mean the timing was very fortunate had we done it six months before or after might have had a different result so sometimes the timing timing works out but you're right it's ultimately it's a marathon not a sprint but anyway let's talk about sphere builder because I am a big believer and I'm quoting one of our frequent guests on our show Ryan de april so I don't want to steal his words but it's probably not probably not even his initial words but he's something he professors to all of his agents which is your network your net worth is or your network is your net worth right so the idea that your sphere is really where you're going to build your business maintain your business that is your asset or and so this idea of deep sort of figuring out how to further deepen those relationships create more bonds more connection is only going to help grow the business but you need help to do that and that's what you guys do so let's let's talk about sphere builder yeah so sphere builder is and I will talk about the application but I want to talk more about sort of this this movement that we're trying to create around this idea of building a digital sphere and it's got sort of multi facets to it the first is that at to your point agents when you go into room if you say to a group of agents do you have a sphere one they all they all say yes I've got yeah and they know what it is right and they know it is because it's so important to their business and and you know just this last week some data came out Zillow now owns 50% of the search market and and when you look at 98% of search is owned by big portals and by some large brokerage companies only 2% is owned by the rest of the entire rest of the industry right it used to be that and what is searches today's version of the Sunday paper from 20 years ago yeah that that acted as a place where people could get outreach to or from and and so the industry whether it's right or wrong lost the search battle it's gone it's now owned by other people that you know the traditional industry view as non-traditionalists um so the question is does that mean that the industry is um subservient to those folks and the answer is no because the sphere who agents um uh know in their local communities um their local presence uh cannot be matched by a portal um and and it's that group of people that no like and we talked about us all that but no like and trust the agent um you're walking down the street you're in your local environment and and you're the expert um you're the influencer in your local community and and yet when we talk about spheres of influence most agents are really able to talk about how that sphere works in real life you know the 100 or 200 people that are in their in their quote unquote rola dex or a CRM that if they walked down the street and bumped into them they they could have a conversation um but what we've seen is that today with the emergence of the digital world social channels um google all those things there is another sphere of influence and that's what we call the digital sphere of influence and we believe uh and our data shows that the tools and strategies and tactics used to build your sphere in real life where you are engaged your personality comes out all those things are different than the tools and tactics and strategies that are that are necessary to build your digital sphere and yet that digital sphere the breadth and the scope of that sphere can be 10 100 1000 x the number of people that can be in your real life sphere and and can do the sit but can do the same thing it can create that no like trust relationship um that that does not reliant on search engines or portals or paid lead gen or all that to generate a great word of mouth referrals and at the end of the day um the the best and most sustainable businesses in real estate operate off those word of mouth referrals and and repeat business so if i just to recap what you said because you said a lot and and i want to make sure that i i caught it correctly um this idea of having a digital sphere will say is uh we can get the same results as a in person sphere we'll call it we'll just i'll just use in person and digital as opposites um and in person sphere we we we know we we understand that we we understand the value of that we we also know that there's a value to the digital sphere what what i guess the distinction we're making is that both can get you incredible results but with the on the digital side number one your reach is exponential because of course the way that technology uh connects us uh the social is obviously apparent to everyone but also the techniques or the practices to cultivate the digital sphere is going to be a different set of practices or or the some degree different than what you might do in person to develop those relationships that that's correct and and and most agents today do a very poor job of being a digital marketer now and i want to and i want to um and it's not because they're not able to i mean they're not they're certainly capable they just haven't learned the tools and the techniques in order to do that right i was laughing because i put myself in the poor digital marketing category as well so i i i i'm one of i'm one i am one of me i am just like the listeners well and you have lots of friends so so don't don't feel alone in that in that category um and it's important that um one thing that we what one of our monitors is this in in every organization there is a sales function there's a sales department and there's a marketing department and they're different they're they're managed by different talent sets the the deliverables are different sales is about lead gen and conversion and the driving of revenue and marketing is about positioning and branding and and creating a a fertile ground for the sales people to to work off of they work synergistically and collectively together toward the same result but they're fundamentally different functions in any organization um a real estate agent is an organization it's a business right and and what we believe is that um and it's it's it's a sales business so the people that come into it tend to be great on the sales side they know how to lead generate they're good at it um it's you know the technology tools that have been built today are focused on lead generation if you go to any Facebook group and you talk about you throw out the word lead gen you've got people from a variety of different perspectives talking about the best the next the coolest the newest lead generation scenario um big companies talk about the leverage of lead gen lead gen lead gen all great but lead gen without marketing sales without marketing is only half of the equation and and so um our perspective in our technology is designed to help agents not be better lead generators there's plenty of stuff out there to be lead generates but to actually help agents be better digital marketers and and that's what we're trying to solve with sphere builder um because we want the business to come to agents through building of great spheres as opposed to an agent having to go cultivate that business through lead generation interesting so how do how do you do that well um first of all the the cool thing about the digital sphere um and a digital agents online presence is it's measurable with data um we can actually look and we have a tool called sphere index it's the first uh tool of its kind it's uh groundbreaking it's a real-time analytics tool where an agent will come in and provide to us um their social handles their google business profile there's zill review page variety of places where they show up online they give us those public profiles and then we have uh an application that goes out and essentially crawls those sites takes looks at the at the public accessible data we don't look at private stuff we're just looking at what anybody would see if if if I went to your um your Facebook page or your Instagram page we have a we have a way to to look at that we capture it and then we run it through an algorithm um that basically measures and puts different um um i'll call it emphasis on certain activities and then we come up with a score and that's what we call our sphere index score it takes about three minutes it's free um and and it's it's the first like I said real-time scoring mechanism of an agent's digital presence it's important that when you begin a digital marketing journey you begin with a baseline because what happened what's happening in the industry today agents will go to our conference or they'll see something on Facebook or they'll go to a um they'll watch somebody somewhere and they say you should do this and so they'll throw that piece of spaghetti at the wall and then it won't generate immediate results they go that didn't work and then they'll go see somebody else saying something else and they go they'll take that other piece of I'm an Italian guy so you know the it won't be spaghetti it'll be rigatoni they'll throw rigatoni at the wall right um and and that didn't work right that didn't produce a lead oh shoot um then they'll see somebody else and they'll say well that's some vermicelli and then throw throw some vermicelli at the wall and then and so there's constantly throwing things at the wall we want to get them off of that um of that treadmill and say look it let's look at where you are let's measure it let's measure it against a benchmark and this is the cool thing that we developed um we have what's called a local pro benchmark and the idea is that and and if you go to our site you'll see um we we we essentially create a score zero to 100 as to how effective an agent is in their digital marketing presence but if we just said to you DJ your score is 45 you're gonna go great what does that mean well honestly it means nothing because there's no relevancy to it there's no comparison to it so what we do when we go into a local market and we we launched this application first in in Denver and Huntsville just a couple weeks ago and it's going to be going nationwide um we go and create we actually look at top producers so in Denver and Huntsville we went out and collected data around the top uh five percent of agents in those two market areas by volume production these are the agents that are doing production right um and we ran all those agents through our algorithm and we then developed a score that reflects how those agents are doing digital marketing what is their what are their Facebook profiles look like what does their Instagram profiles look like how do they show up on on Zillow how many reviews do they have all those things do they have a Google profile what's on their Google profile what are their reviews on in Google or Facebook or Instagram a massive amount of data and we created a score that basically is this benchmark that says if you're a top producer in these markets your marketing looks like up 72 okay now when I say to DJ you're 45 yeah you say okay I'm a 45 compared to people that are in the top five percent of the industry doing 72 and we want you to the next question to be how do I get better how do I actually get from 45 to 72 and we patterned the application off of a very popular consumer application called credit karma I'm not sure if you're a user credit karma but we we love it and credit karma basically gives consumers a credit score and and says okay you're a 675 right well good you need to get to 700 to be good and if you want to get to excellent maybe you want to be to 800 and then they take you through this prescriptive journey in doing things to help you have a better credit score and as you do those things when you go back to credit karma your 675 just became 700 and then it became 725 it became 750 and now you have this this scoring incentive around your credit score that that helps you go through this this journey right because it's not a 90 day get fit quick scenario it's a journey it's a long term approach and so we say credit karma is for consumers on their credit journey as sphere builder is for real estate agents on their digital marketing journey so we start with a score and then we create what we call recommendation cards and we help agents based upon their data not other people's data their data how they can improve their profiles how they can create content both non-listing and listing content to create more engagement more followers to build it and over time as we remasier them that's that for your 45 will become a 50 and the 55 and the 60 and all of a sudden you're going to be at 70 which is similar to a benchmark and we've seen a tight correlation between digital marketing activities and production so as there's a positive correlation then between the score as it rises you're seeing income production volume increase as a result of tightening up some of the practices you know this is this is very very interesting because it's it's it's so it's so interesting so I you know talk about measuring and we don't really measure social engagements as a whole or sorry sorry I just say digital marketing we'll just say we don't really measure it we measure it in little silos right we say well we did this one post and here's here the results and I like it or I don't like it or here's what I need to fix for the next time and then over time you can maybe start to see some trends in videos that are produced or static images that you're throwing up on Instagram Facebook TikTok even and you can start to start to figure out what your audience is into but what what you guys have done is actually say we're gonna actually we're gonna actually benchmark the most successful agents in your area and kind of show you what they're doing and guide you from where you are today almost like a credit card repairing your credit score repairing your social media credit score over time and as you increase we're gonna be checking to make sure it's going up and you just gonna do these several things that we're gonna suggest to you and then you're going to get the results of that I mean it's it's a very simple idea but it is it is brilliant in a way because it really does it's like you know I can step on the scale every day and it'll tell me how what my actual weight is and it might also tell me my body fat and whatever metrics it it measures but if I only look at that weight measurement I don't really know what that tells me right it tells me what my overall weight is but it's not particularly helpful to to know if I'm healthy or not I mean yes it would tell me if I'm overweight or underweight but other than that it's kind of like what do you do with that and what do you want it to be and that's where people then go to personal trainers or dietitians or people that can actually make sense of this this information and say here's where you really want to be and here's how to get there I love the fact that you guys are like a prescriptive kind of service where it's like you know we're gonna we're gonna you're gonna go see the doctor we're gonna give you your weight and then we're gonna tell you what you need to do to to get to get you know more fit so to speak in the digital marketing space super exciting and I don't to my knowledge I don't know of any company that's that's currently doing that for REALTORS no we're we are the first you know we won't be the last I mean every good idea has other folks that want to replicate it but we are the first real time analytics and and marketing platform that you know there are some things that we do that other people do nobody has put the package together and what we've found is that REALTORS don't they want easy and they want things to be very intuitive and one thing we've done in the design process is try to put everything in one platform so an agent you know is not having to navigate from one platform to another platform to you know log in log out log in log out the hope is that this becomes their digital marketing platform you know we have content creation opportunities it's it's very canva-like in from a content creation standpoint we connect to an MLS and so the moment an agent takes a listing that listing shows up in our in our in our applications so an agent can then create marketing materials around that listing we have both an organic sharing function so we can take content and seamlessly if you've got multiple social channels with one click share that content out in one click in a very effective way and we also have an advertising platform obviously organic sharing is great because it helps your current followers know that you're doing things but if you want to grow your sphere you've got to advertise you've got to reach new people with new content and and so our system essentially replaces replaces Facebook ads manager which is for most agents a nightmare and now you could take content that's created in the platform and with a couple of clicks get advertising campaigns created so it's designed to be kind of a one-stop shop that begins it's wrapped around data and analytics and and that's the thing that we as we were idating around the idea we actually went out to this industry called martec marketing technology it's a $500 billion worldwide industry and we looked at martec applications outside of the real estate industry so now we'll real estate was doing but what other B2B and B2C companies were doing with martec and the two things we found that really kind of drove how we ideated around the technology was one automation was critical right and and today automation is very possible and and quite frankly it's going to become even more interesting with the chat gpt stuff and then analytics and let's we're interwoven with all of the automation and drove with with data and machine learning the ability to to be smart automators and so we're bringing those two things together in an application the the metaphor that we use internally is we built an iceberg we want agents to see the tip top of it above the water that's beautiful and easy and to navigate around but underneath it is a massive amount of of application data and and tools that the agent will never see but will help them be better at at this marketing game i i think that's great this idea of just getting a score there used to be a social score service that was popular about 15 years ago and i can't recall the name it is clout yes with a k clout with a k uh and and thank you that is a thank you and and if anyone who's listing remembers clout you would get a score and you wouldn't know what to do with it you would see it and you would go okay i'm a 77 or whatever it was and you're like i don't know what that means um right and and and they never figured out what to do with the number and i don't know the business yeah yeah yeah they they they had a really neat idea the metric of it and then they weren't able to say well here's here's how to improve that score um that's what you guys are essentially doing and at which i absolutely love so what are some of the lessons you've learned from studying some of these top producers in the various markets that you guys have explored what are some of the things they're doing well on on social or digital marketing um any suggestions just overall suggestions that you or even mistakes that you see agents making well um we talked about the mistakes let's talk about the successes because it's a far more positive thing right um we actually as we're building the application we said you know there's there's a bunch there's people out there that are being successful in this digital marketing endeavors and we need to go out and find them and do some research around them and and bring their stories to the rest of the industry and so we spent months researching and writing a industry paper that you mentioned thank you at the beginning of the show um you can you can go to it at sirbuilder.io and and navigate to the paper and and download it um it's about an 18 page it's not it's not a two-page or it's a very in-depth paper it's a deep dive it's a deep dive it's a worthy read it's everybody should go go to spherebuilder.io and scroll to the bottom or you'll you'll see it's actually right at the top put in your information you you're going to want to read this and we we found I mean there's we we found many we can only highlight four um uh Nikki Bochamp um Stacy Stobb, Pinky Benson, Brad Allen, a couple of folks run brokerage companies, some are individual agents um different parts of the country doing things all incredibly successful all very successful but doing things differently and and so the first learning is that there there is no one-size-fits-all approach uh and and we don't um when we talk about being prescriptive we don't tell agents this is who you need to be online the the thing that stood out with all of these folks and I think if you were if they were your guests they would say there's an authenticity that comes through in who they uh purport to be online because again think about this in this in the sphere building in real life you meet somebody in your church group or your kids' soccer team or whatever environment and and it's you and them and and your personality and who you are is coming through um well now you've got to replicate that in an online digital environment where you've got to provide snippets of of information about who you are and what makes you you and and everybody's different and unique and so um what we found is that they all approached both the platforms that they used that they relied on some were heavy YouTube others heavy Instagram others heavy Facebook some Twitter others combination of all the all the of the above and more tiktok um find the platforms that you really want to excel on that matches who you are and the method and that you want to share content and then the the second piece is be consistent and um over time because this is not a 90 day diet you're not going to become a successful digital marketer by approaching it with a 90 day lead gen mentality you won't so you might as well not do it it's like it's like going on um you know a 90 day diet you may lose weight right and that 90 diet but guess what if you don't change your lifestyle that weight's going to come right back on yeah um you can you can fix your credit score um and yet if you go back to the same spending patterns your credit score is going to go right back to where it is and the same analogy holds through for digital marketing if you don't build a sustainable approach to developing the no-like trust persona online then you you you may make short term inroads but long term if you're in this business for the long term and that's who our customer is what we're not and you know I hate to say this but we really don't want to serve agents who are in in the business to make a quick buck that's not who we're marketing to we want agents that are serious about being real estate professionals um a lot of the quick buck agents are leaving the business because it's not as easy to make that quick buck anymore right and so we want to help those agents that truly love this business our professionals do great service for their clients and need help being better marketers and the four people that we highlighted in the paper I think are great lessons for agents and you're you know watching this podcast to go and read about how they're approaching this marketing approach and being very successful at it in different ways yeah so walk me through so let's say I sign up I submit my my social channels to to you guys you you start um which by the way you you can do for free um you can go to their the website again also to check out the white paper sphere builder dot i.o is where you can go to do this but anyway let's say I sign up I submit my my social accounts to to your team you start to analyze it you assign me a social score relative to the you know an agent in my agents in my market who are who are do have a strong digital presence as well as a strong uh business um and so now I know where I'm at where some people I might aspire to be are at then how do you help get me from here to there so we have these recommendation cards and so we've analyzed your data and for example we will analyze your social profiles um there's a ton of information on your social profiles that um it's important to be consistent in how you provide that information and a lot of agents are are not consistent the first thing I will tell you is that um we ask you whether you have a Google business profile um if you do not have a Google business profile you will not score well in our in our system because if you don't have a Google business profile Google in in Google search how somebody's going to find you um they they punish you right um in from a search algorithm standpoint so the very first thing we will say is get your Google profile and and we provide a link to go do that um we also analyze the the data that's on your profile so if you don't have a website link there if you don't have a phone number if the information is not consistent we we show that to you again lots of agents um maybe got their Google profile Google business profile three years ago and then move brokerage companies well guess what they probably still have some of their same they haven't updated it so there's somebody who goes to Google profile Google business profile sees brokerage information from three years ago well that's not good right and and so consumers are smart especially the younger consumers they they stock agents right before they make that phone call reach out they're looking at your online presence and if they see inconsistent um profile information that's a sign that you are not on top of how you present yourself to them how well are you going to be on top of presenting their property in a listing right it means something to consumers today so we go through that process and then we start analyzing you know what is your follower base how engaged are your followers how often are you posting what are the posts doing for you and then we help you uh get better at that through content uh both listing content not listing content um it's it's not hard it's just something that requires a bit of training and we want to make it fun at the same time right so hopefully the fun comes in and in seeing that score tick up as you do these things uh and hopefully generates some business in in the uh in the context and you can see this this uh we call a virtuous cycle of um of of feedback that breeds activity more good feedback more good activity it's like getting on I mean you're an allergy to stepping on the scale if you if you're if you're trying to lose weight and you step on the scale in the morning and you see that you're two pounds lighter you're going to be psyched to go on that evening run right that's true and and and that's what we want to create that that measurement over time is that uh dopamine hit that we want to deliver to the age to keep them on the train down this path I I think that is so well said it really you're coaching company of sorts but in a different way you're a digital coaching company in the sense that and an analytics company I I don't I don't want to lump you in with with all the other coaching programs out there because that's not really what you you do but in a sense you are consulting firm I guess maybe that's a better way to say it because what what you're doing is you say give us all your dad not not all your dad are but all your social uh channels so we can analyze the data and we can take a look and see what works what isn't working where there's room for improvement and then come back and say hey by the way we noticed your LinkedIn hasn't been updated in three years and it's still showing you with your previous firm um by the way your your your Zillow you have three different Zillow profiles they're all over the place uh we need to get all of this working cohesively because we don't know where someone's going to look for information for you but certainly Google you know is is is Google my business for example uh is is a place that that you know people don't think about but of course we all utilize when we're searching for for local things so the idea is you guys are going to give suggestions and not just you know top 10 things to do to get your digital marketing health in order but really saying very prescriptively here's based on what you're currently doing and we've analyzed everything here's what the exact steps you mr. missus agent need to take yeah so two things i want to want to clarify one is is we are not we're a SaaS technology company so we don't provide managed services we don't charge agents for talking to a human that is that's not what we're about in fact um we we want to support coaching organizations um our application would be a great i mean if you're a coaching organization you should call us and here's why because today you have zero ability because i don't think you have our tool it took us um a long time and a lot of engineering to build the tool that we have um we can help you help your clients if you're a coach understand their their digital presence and manage it over time to the extent that there's specific things that that a coaching organization is helping their agents or their their clients do we don't want to replace that we want to augment that right and so really there's a place there's a really uh synergistic place for us to work with coaching organizations because of the approach that we take to data analytics so that's that's number one um and and you know number two is um you know in terms of of um right now we're we're i want to make sure that we're clear with your viewers uh we're in Denver and Huntsville today um we're going to be doing a national launch um in the next quarter uh and available um to agents around the country um so there's a place on our website that if you're interested in this technology you can let us know and um part of of us developing why it's so slow to roll out is we need MLS data right and uh and and MLS you know working with MLS is they're great to work with but they're not the speediest organizations in the world um and so um we'd love to if if there's an MLS listing to this we'd love to talk with you because um these are this is the kind of application that um we're the partnership with an MLS we can bring it to all your agents and and get them going on the application and then finally the third thing i will say is um we've had really great conversations with brokerage companies who want to integrate the application as a productivity tool um we're being told by brokerage executives at agents especially today are looking for ways to build market share and you know back to my old business school days there was this old adage that in at the top of the cycle you drive revenue that's when you you put your foot on the on the gas pedal and you make as much money as you possibly can and at the bottom of the cycle you drive market share people are going out of business you capture their market share so that when the cycle recovers you can step on the gas pedal and so now is absolutely an art opinion and we're hearing it from brokerage companies executives as well is that we're in a down cycle nobody can change that right and and we know what will get better and the cycle will wrap up again now is when smart brokerage companies as smart agents will be building market share and there's no better way to do it than traditional marketing yeah this is the year to capture market share it is uh we again as Russ said we know there's been an Exodus uh uh started already uh we we also have a holding company for agents that don't actively practice and now it's the weirdest thing i never thought i would say this but our holding company actually has more agents than our actively producing company um they're not related they're separate entities but but we we never thought that this little holding company that we created would now have like 900 agents it's because uh the conditions of the market have changed and people are the ones e2z agents um the the part timers are starting to to exit and and uh sunset out and it's a great time for agents to pick up market share this year so this is a good time to get your digital marketing health uh in order um and and you know again i i i always i have this fantasy Russ it's so funny because what you guys uh person what you do in real estate is kind of the always the fantasy i have around the service providers in my life so like my accountant all i i mean i want my accountant to keep me out of prison and to make sure that i'm not being audited of course yes that's that's the job of the of the uh accountant but i what i would read my fantasy is that my accountant goes i have a few ideas for you this year right my accountant doesn't do that and i'm not disparage i'm not trying to say anything uh pejorative towards towards my account i love my accountant but that would you know those are what what what i would be looking for i'd like to know you know here's what you could do to you know this next year to really increase uh you know your or decrease your tax exposure or whatever so basically you guys are prescriptive service and i love that and you're utilizing technology and and really you're not reinventing the wheel you're not saying well this is what we think works you're literally just going market by market and saying here's what the people in your market are doing and that and i understand also the challenge of connecting to all the MLS's to get this data uh i i can appreciate that all the MLS's have different apis they it's got to be a nightmare i i can't imagine what your engineers have to deal with there but um this is something that you definitely want to be on the waiting list for because once they do open up in your market place the top agents are going to subscribe to the service because it's the only one that exists out there so now's a great time to learn about it uh also learn some best practices if you read the white paper they have four case studies that are just incredible reads of really successful agents in four different markets and what they're doing digitally and they're doing things a little differently as Russ said and you can take some of their uh the the their suggestions and actually apply it to your own business but i want to know um are my digital marketing score as well so if you go to spherebuilder.io you can see the white paper you can uh get on their waiting list to see if when they open up in your our in your market and by the way if you're in Huntsville alabama or Denver and we have listeners i'm sure in both of those markets um we should reach out because they are basically almost good to go there so they are ready to launch um Russ is there anything else that that we should know about what the tool does uh no i think this has been a great conversation uh DJ and and and i think um uh we've we've covered um right place right time for a new piece of technology you know we we we know that agents are are inundated today with people looking for their attention um and uh and so this is something that um is is worth a few minutes of agents time to come in and investigate just the white paper in and of itself uh is is worthy of spending an hour with and reading it and uh and it will generate ideas for you even if you never use our technology uh or ever become a subscriber um you'll get some great ideas and you know we're a company um that is built with people who have been around the industry for a long time who support the industry we're not about disintermediating the REALTOR in fact we're about empowering the REALTOR i i i i as i said in the beginning i'd be i fell in love with the industry and the people in the industry 30 years ago and uh i think that um uh the united states needs effective REALTOR is helping consumers and this is just one way that we can help that process i i agree so everyone who is listening please visit spherebuilder dot i oh by the way we'll have a link to that in our show notes so you can just scroll there and click and get read the white paper get on their wait list continue to follow uh calabra which again is the company that that is putting out these products and see if it would be a good fit for your brokerage and by the way if you volunteer or work at the local state or national association level great conversation to have that your next meetings with whatever committees you might be with it say hey this might be something we would want to bring to an association uh or an MLS directly as well so i imagine um that that could happen for you guys so that's very exciting well we we we we we are
