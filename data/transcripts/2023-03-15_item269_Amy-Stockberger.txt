[00:03:04] Okay, today on the show, we have Amy Stockburger with Amy Stockburger real estate in Sioux Falls, South Dakota.
[00:03:11] Let me tell you more about Amy.
[00:03:13] Now, Amy and her husband are broker owners of Amy Stockburger real estate and also run a team-erage brokerage model, which I'm excited to learn more about.
[00:03:23] Now, they have been the highest producing team in the state of South Dakota since 2017 and ranked 23rd in the nation by real trends.
[00:03:32] They served 559 clients for 171 million in volume back in 2021.
[00:03:38] That was with 15 agents last year.
[00:03:42] They did four, a work with 486 clients, 166 million in volume.
[00:03:48] Now, Amy created a unique and all inclusive lifetime home support system that turns their clients into referral machines, resulting in over 70% of their business sourced from relationship referrals.
[00:04:00] Amy has also successfully monetized each pillar of her lifetime home support model, which is added a lucrative revenue stream while gaining clients and agent loyalty like no other.
[00:04:12] To learn more, please visit Amy's website, which is Amy Stockburger.com, which is AMY, STO, CK, B-E-R, G-E-R.com.
[00:04:22] And by the way, we have a link to that in the show notes. Amy, welcome to the show.
[00:04:27] Thanks for having me, DJ. I'm glad to be here.
[00:04:30] We got started a little late because Amy is down in Florida right now.
[00:04:34] And I was very, very jealous because I will be actually just a couple of hours from where she is starting in a couple days.
[00:04:40] So I got very excited and we talked a lot about the winter months and how nice it is to get away for a moment or two.
[00:04:48] But Amy, I'm excited to speak with you and you and your husband's team and all of your agents.
[00:04:55] You guys are just obviously you're crushing it.
[00:04:57] So I'm always fascinated by people who are doing really well and our audience loves to hear how you do that and how you started.
[00:05:06] And I'd love to go all the way back to the beginning of your career in real estate and first learn why real estate.
[00:05:13] How did you get involved? Why? And what was it like when you first started?
[00:05:18] You got it. So I got into real estate street out of college. My dad had owned a cobble banker brokerage at the time and did a really excellent thing for me.
[00:05:26] He got me a job at that time. I made $24,000 a year and I'm the oldest high D high I and he put me in the back office and said,
[00:05:36] Hey, sink or swim. See what you can do. And he did the best thing for me. He taught me everything from the back end.
[00:05:42] On the support team part of it and just knowing the administrative part of running a brokerage.
[00:05:48] And then I fell in love with the industry. I got licensed and I've done about every single position you can do within the real estate industry.
[00:05:57] So I started out support. I then got licensed and I became a buyer's agent, which at that time was very, very, very new.
[00:06:04] There was a lot of teams at that point. And then I became a single agent when I'm out on my own.
[00:06:09] And then quickly started my own team with my sister in a part time assistant.
[00:06:15] And then my husband joined my business back in 2009. And that's what we really started to scale and take a hobby that paid me and made it into a lucrative career.
[00:06:23] And then we were team for a long time. And then we started our brokerage in 2019 and still run it as a team or as a brokerage.
[00:06:32] Yeah, as a team in our brokerage, we call it the team marriage, meaning that we still give all of that support that we really feel agents need.
[00:06:38] To make them very, very successful in their craft. And my vision is to create big juicy legacies for everybody within my ecosystem by using my lifetime home support foundation.
[00:06:52] So there's a lot to unpack there. Thank you for that information. I was one thing that really struck me. And again, really speaks to how well you run your brokerage and your team is that you really started this in 2019, which again,
[00:07:07] you was not a not a chance not an easy year to do much of anything in real estate, right? So the fact that you, you know, during the pandemic were able to put these sort of processes in place and start the foundation of this team, which again, I know you've been working in real estate long time before that.
[00:07:24] But this idea of doing this in the middle of the pandemic boy, that's what a bold and courageous move.
[00:07:30] Well, we started the brokerage in 2019. We started our real growth pattern really started in 2009. And we started our lifetime home support, you know, our model of lifetime home support.
[00:07:40] We started that really in 2015. That's when I really figured out that the way I was doing things, I loved taking care of the client. I loved the experience of the clients,
[00:07:51] we're getting and I wanted to make sure that we were providing the highest level of service to keep us top of mind for them to have them review it,
[00:07:58] refer us as much as possible and repeat business. And so that was the really the game changer for us is when we put that into our business.
[00:08:09] Because then we're we had a process, a system of strategy to help the client before, during and after the home buying and selling process.
[00:08:16] And there's so much to be said about how that before and after relationship part is could be even more important than that during the transaction relationship part.
[00:08:27] Yeah, I've always thought that that was probably the maybe the thing I've tried to focus on in the show and talking to guests is I'm not.
[00:08:36] Well, initially when I first started the show, I was mostly interested in how they treated their clients during a transaction.
[00:08:41] Because of course, top 1% producers are clearly, you know, providing a level of service and support that maybe other agents aren't.
[00:08:49] So initially that was my my my main interest when I started the show and then I realized pretty quickly early on that top producers all had very, very impressive strategies for while working with the client.
[00:09:01] But then I sort of got bored listening to it because it was a lot of the same stuff and then I thought, well, I'm actually more interested in what happens in between sales.
[00:09:09] Because that's I think where a lot of missed opportunities happen.
[00:09:12] Obviously, you know, agents oftentimes just forget because they're busy there in the middle of a million other things.
[00:09:18] And it's like, oh, so and so bought a home three years ago. Yeah, I should probably reach out, but having an actual strategy so that you're staying and touch and providing value is amazing.
[00:09:28] But I wanted to actually go back to something you said because I always every year I say I'm going to remember to ask guests more about this.
[00:09:35] And I never do. And I'm so glad because I would have forgotten today, but you you actually just jagged my memory.
[00:09:40] You were saying that you weren't necessarily super happy with the way you were running things until was it around 2015 when you started really working on your process.
[00:09:50] So I'm curious is what were you doing back then that you that it's just to identify a problem or an issue that you were having.
[00:09:57] What were some of the issues you were having that you caused you to want to create a solution for?
[00:10:02] Well, I was looking at the lifetime value of a client. What is your lifetime value of a client? The value of them throughout your entire career.
[00:10:09] And it was putting the numbers to that that you know, in a career typically,
[00:10:12] lifetime value of a client, the times they're going to transact is that you know, in our market 100 to 175,000 dollars.
[00:10:18] And then what does that look like then for the lifetime value of the referrals of that they're giving us.
[00:10:23] If if say 10 to 15% of your your sphere is going to transact within 12 months, what's that mean when you you keep,
[00:10:30] you know, multiplying that success on making sure that your clients are becoming your referral partners.
[00:10:36] And so when I did in 2015 or before what made me actually start the lifetime home support model that I created is I was running crazy open houses.
[00:10:46] I was spending, it's, it felt like I had all this money going out on lead generation that the ROI wasn't there.
[00:10:53] And I just knew that there had to be a better way to take care of my clients so that their experience was top notch.
[00:10:59] And then I also wanted to make sure that I again had them there for being my referral partners.
[00:11:04] And then I wanted to monetize it. I that's a big part of my my my systems person.
[00:11:08] Like I said, hi, hi, there's a system and strategy for every part of our business and having that in place,
[00:11:15] I decided to put my VIP club in. And so what my VIP club is and I have a lot of different pillars within our business of our lifetime home support.
[00:11:23] The one we're going to I was going to visit with you about today was that VIP club where our clients get access to all of our pillars or a VIP club before during and after.
[00:11:32] So lifetime access for free. And so one of the first things I did is I put a moving truck in place 15 foot moving truck in place.
[00:11:40] Put that there for my clients to serve them before during and after four life they get to use it for free.
[00:11:45] But I monetized it right away. So I went back and I how did you monetize it?
[00:11:50] So I figured out what my my debt service was for it and I went and sold that space on the back of it and made money off of my truck.
[00:11:57] So they so do you purchase the truck or did you lease the truck and like how did you do that?
[00:12:03] Yeah, I purchased it, but you can leave. So I have created a whole system for other agents to take what it took me.
[00:12:10] How many years to to to perfect and I always say I have a PhD in failing forward. I've made all the mistakes.
[00:12:16] So what I've done is created a VIP course start your VIP course.com and it basically it's a copy and paste formula to implement and monetize your VIP club.
[00:12:26] So agents can go out and take everything that all the material I have. I have a at seven modules. I have it broken down into the blueprint for your 30 second elevator speech about your VIP club.
[00:12:39] I've it broken down on how to monetize each pillar. So I have a moving truck. I have a party supply. I have a tool shed.
[00:12:44] I have a discount market center. I have a client event section. I have an agent recruitment section.
[00:12:50] And then I show them how to monetize each side of that with every system they need within it.
[00:12:55] Like there's one whole module of just operations because there's so much that happens with all the departments within your company.
[00:13:00] And if you don't have your systems, you're not going to scale. You need those two or sisters. You need systems to scale.
[00:13:05] That's just how it works. And so I have a whole module that's just on you.
[00:13:09] Here's a checklist you need for every part of your business to implement and monetize this VIP program because at the end of the day, your clients are going to remember that experience.
[00:13:21] And this experience that we're providing, which I'll go deeper into on the next part of it here is that they're going to remember it no matter what if you're there.
[00:13:31] And you have the systems in place to keep top of mind, you know, Gary Keller said it in the linear real estate that humans have two places in their brain for REALTORS.
[00:13:38] And it's our jobs to knock the other one out and so that we're staying top of mind. So they're their repeat business and referral business.
[00:13:46] And so the trucks was the first thing. Monetize those. I have two going to have three here in 23. So monetize those guys.
[00:13:54] And then I added my party and tool shed almost almost immediately. And so what that is, I have party and tool equipment that they can use.
[00:14:02] So like think of banquet tables and chairs, commercial grade food, warmers, cotton candy, snow, coal popcorn machines, platters, anything you could think of for a party, bouncy houses, all those things.
[00:14:14] So clients can come back and use those for free for life. But a big part of this is that I put my brand on everything.
[00:14:20] So again, with my truck, my clients get to use my trucks. My trucks are a marketing vehicle for me. They get out 600 some, you know, impressions per mile. I bet they're out there.
[00:14:30] So and then I monetize the back of them. So people, so I make money off of my trucks. And then now it's my party party equipment. So everything that, you know, people for graduations parties, people, my clients can back and use these for life.
[00:14:42] They throw parties. My name is everywhere. My brand is everywhere. So again, it's more brand awareness, right? They're in there. And I'm able to then, you know, obviously, my clients are referring us because they're getting such value from us.
[00:14:53] And then there's so many stages of home ownership. So we created our tool shed. Our tool shed has everything you can think of that a client would need for every season of home ownership. So from ladders, wheel barrels, commercial grade paint sprayers, carpet cleaners, you know, the big fans, all those things.
[00:15:09] Yeah. So basically you guys have all this equipment. Your clients are able to contact you at any time say, hey, I need to borrow a power washer for my deck.
[00:15:17] Or I need I have a children's party coming up and need a need to I can I use the bouncy house and and then your truck is is there on at the event. I'm assuming or or nearby the event where people can see it. Your name is everywhere.
[00:15:32] You've monetized the truck. So it pays for itself. And you're getting all this amazing marketing exposure. And you become the person that you're you create the stickiness because your clients are like, oh, Amy's got everything. I'm going to just go to her. I'm one of her clients.
[00:15:46] That is brilliant. Absolutely brilliant.
[00:15:49] Then so because because we have we have over it's actually this year. I bet you we're going to be probably 2500 reservations that we're going to have from our clients this year.
[00:15:59] But because that there's so and again, again, this is your branding yourself. You're serving your clients. That's what you want to do. You're brand new self and then you're monetizing. I monetized all of them. So my party shed tool shed. They're all monetized too.
[00:16:10] And you're I created software because of that because your clients need a one-stop shop that's just about you. So when you think about the cycle of a buyer seller, they're out on your websites and your socials when they're betting you out.
[00:16:22] And or when they're looking for houses. That's what they're doing. And that's it. Yeah. They're not coming back to your website again.
[00:16:29] They're going to Zillow any other time to check the price and see what their homes worth. Yeah. So I created software. My lifetime home support software. So my clients can go out and I
[00:16:39] I sell up to my students too, where it has everything they need. So you're serving. I'm providing value. They're going and looking at all of the equipment we have. They're renting it on that on my software. So these we can pick it up. It's all set up by systems inside of us so that my FTE, my full-time employee time on this is next in nothing because of this software.
[00:16:57] So you don't have to actually organize that a lot. It's all done through us.
[00:17:00] Yep. And then in that software though is set up where I have you know all my my Facebook blog, my Facebook feed. So that's in front of them. Everything to my client event is up there.
[00:17:11] Everything for my home support team partners, which is another pillar. I'll talk to you about my private Facebook group for them is on there.
[00:17:17] So I have listings on there. Easy way for us to review review me and my agents. So again, it's it's a place for them to go one step shop that has everything they need. And I'm not selling to them. I'm serving to them.
[00:17:29] Right. And again, if there's one lead generation that everybody should focus on the most and spend the most amount of money on is their data bank.
[00:17:37] Their data bank, especially in a market like this in this type of market is an opportunity market for those who.
[00:17:44] For those who are frozen in fear, they're going to get just they're they're going to get passed by they're going to get passed by right now.
[00:17:51] And always that market is an opportunity market. And this is who are we're going to go in and pick up market share. That's our market shares 23 you know what climbing is the theme of our year that we're going in and that's you need and you need to do it through your data bank because they are the best for no length and trust you.
[00:18:07] And the referrals from your data bank are the best referrals to work with.
[00:18:11] They're almost guaranteed. Yeah.
[00:18:12] They're guaranteed and they come to you knowing your value and one of the big things too about this lifetime home support model like my ISA department.
[00:18:20] We have an eight percent, you know, contact to contract conversion rate. You know the market average is like one to two.
[00:18:29] Explain that to me. I'm sorry. I wasn't not sure I totally understood that my my ISA contract to close right. We have an eight percent conversion contract to close got it.
[00:18:37] Yeah, so that contract to close sorry from contact to close contact. We got it. Got it. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. So the minute so a lead comes in. So my lifetime home support model is a hook because you have to know that anybody who's going on to any website.
[00:18:51] They're talking to five to six other brokers too. So my lifetime home support model is the hook that that keeps them with us that hey with us you get access to all of these things for life. And I haven't gone through all of them yet. But this is what we have because we're lifetime home support.
[00:19:04] We're here to save you time stress and money and where the experts have connecting buyers and sellers and we do that and help you build wealth through real estate with our lifetime home support model.
[00:19:12] And so again, having this it just look even if you're doing lead generation for your web leads. You have this hook of lifetime home support that keeps them with you.
[00:19:21] So yes, and boy again, you just said so much as a couple of things I want to I want to dial into because from our listener perspective, you said a couple of things that that really sort of grabbed my attention, which was well actually I'm going to ask you a question.
[00:19:38] So you said this and you said this very quickly. So I want to sort of rewind back to this particular point because I think this year it's particularly important and and I think you would agree.
[00:19:49] But I'm curious because you'd mentioned, you know, your database or your sphere of influence, your you call data bank is, you know, the most powerful source of of new business.
[00:20:00] And what I am curious about is and you'd said a percentage and I just missed it. I know the percentage is 16% that's the number I know, but I don't know which which number I missed the actual.
[00:20:12] 10 to 15.
[00:20:14] Yeah.
[00:20:15] So here's what here's what Amy and I are talking about. So in your database, depending on what numbers you're looking at, we'll say 10 to 15% of the people in your data bank are going to transact in real estate within the next 12 months or Amy correct me if I have that wrong.
[00:20:30] But something to that effect.
[00:20:32] So if we if we know that and if first of all, I think there's a lot of agents that have never even put a database together. But if and if you haven't, this is the time to do it, especially this year because Amy's exactly right all the top producers this year, they are gaining market share, they're gaining market share on the agents that are a little bit reluctant are pulling back.
[00:20:52] And maybe they're a little scared or maybe they're depressed because of the way it interest rates and inventory.
[00:20:57] But the brokers that are stepping on the gas a little bit realizing tonight, this is the year to deepen relationships are just going to take that market share away from the agents that are pulling back.
[00:21:07] But what I wanted to say is we're basically you just basically smashed a myth or what are or discredited a myth, which is I don't have enough potential clients know you do because 10 to 15% of the people you already know.
[00:21:22] Are going to need a real turn in the next 12 months, I guess the question is how what percentage of those 10 to 15% are you actually going to earn or get.
[00:21:30] And if you just sit back and wait, it's probably going to be a smaller percentage that if you're more proactive. And what I what I'm reason I'm making such a big deal about this, I think this is such a relief to agents that are like, I don't have enough leads, I don't have anything new stuff coming. It's like, OK, that that might be.
[00:21:46] But you already have this other huge people, you know, group of people that you you could focus on, you know, developing more intimate relationships more more connected relationships with.
[00:21:57] But anyway, I just wanted to make that point.
[00:21:58] No, and that's true.
[00:21:59] And the best real estate business you can build is a relationship based business real estate will always be relationship based.
[00:22:07] And now is that it's always you should always be doing this, but it's a game changer when you add something like this in to your business because you can scale so quickly and and you're serving.
[00:22:17] And if you're not in this to serve anyway, it's likely not going to work out for you, but you're serving at such a high level that it becomes a law law reciprocity and our humans are so predictable and the law of reciprocity is just you get something you give something back in kind.
[00:22:30] That's just how our brains work. And so the our VIP club is such a huge part of our lifetime home support pillars and you know, another part to that, I should say, so we have our party shed our, you know, our trucks.
[00:22:44] We get those monetized our party shed our tool shed those are all monetized. And again, our tool shed our things, people don't want to buy a render store.
[00:22:51] We have.
[00:22:52] And that's just the way they're going to need you know what they're going to need.
[00:22:55] And in my course, since I've done this for so long, we know and I have it all laid out in there, we know what equipment is good and what is not going to work.
[00:23:03] We know what equipment is going to last you a summer, which one's going to last you two years. So I have laid that all laid out too because that's that's a trial and error thing, you know, that you just wouldn't know if you hadn't done this process.
[00:23:13] So I've done that, but then another part of our home support team is our discount center. So I have a relationship with an online discount center that I'm offering up in this that they can go out and our clients get 85 to 25% off over 100.
[00:23:27] That was in different national big brand names, so like Nike under armor, Walmart, things like that, they get deeper discounts on what they would get products and services.
[00:23:36] There are already going to buy that we're offering up to our clients. So they can save another $5,300 a year just by using that. And that's so that's, you know, here's another thing we're offering you to save you time, stress and money.
[00:23:47] And that has a lot of different lead generation in it that I'm using right now for corporate partnerships and building market share on that, which is totally different process, but it's so, so, so lovely because again, relationship base is a relationship based business is the easiest business to scale.
[00:24:03] And then the next one is my home support team. So again, our clients need so many different services and products throughout all of the seasons of buying and selling, right.
[00:24:15] So I put together what I feel is the best of the best of vendors within my local market, who are part of my home support team. And they give our clients preferential treatment preferential sometimes pricing and are there to make sure they're giving them legendary care like we do.
[00:24:28] So think of your obviously lender inspector, you know, those things we have all those, but then it's H back we have carpet cleaners we have home cleaners we have.
[00:24:39] The interior probably mold remediation.
[00:24:41] Oh, everything. So, you know, I charge these partners $3,500 a year to be a part of my program. And so my clients have access to it. So I have a huge lead gen or a huge revenue source in this.
[00:24:56] But it's it's threefold my home support team is threefold in that it really is so beautiful for my clients because that's another value add to my VIP. So they have access to all of my people that I'm keeping in front of them because we have all the systems in to keep them from supporting partners in front of my clients when they need them.
[00:25:11] They have the discounts they have all of that. But then the second part of it is obviously the revenue generation. And that's another big thing that brokers and team leaders really need to be thinking about this year is what are the revenue streams are you adding into your business.
[00:25:22] It's very important to have other different revenue streams that you have laying down to continue to keep monetizing your business and building it.
[00:25:30] And so, so the second part is that we have the revenue stream coming in and then the third part is market share. So part of the requirement for my home support team partners to be a part is that we get to come in and present to their employees.
[00:25:42] We get to come in and tell them about our lifetime home support model all the things they get would be in any stock for real estate client for life.
[00:25:50] Once we get in and that one to many presentations and showing them all of our our success strategies because we have a we have a at least buy up program.
[00:25:59] We have an instant offer program. We have a guaranteed sales program. We would love it or leave it guaranteed.
[00:26:03] So we have all these systems for every stage that once I get in front of them and I'm telling them about it's far better than anything I can throw on social media.
[00:26:11] It's far better than anything. It's a one to many and then we have a system where we're staying sticky to where we're keeping our information in front of that employees.
[00:26:19] So when they have a life change, which is where we give you a service to anybody in a life change, right. That's what we do as REALTORS.
[00:26:25] That those people are who we can serve. Why would they not call me? They're calling us because we're the broker of choice because we're the ones who are offering the most amount of benefit besides being the leaders and connecting buyers and sellers but everything else they get for life with us.
[00:26:41] So I just want to all of that was amazing. I wanted to point to something that I have never heard anyone else say.
[00:26:48] And I'm just going to kind of focus on it because I think it's something that really any of our any of our listeners could possibly implement.
[00:26:55] Although I will buy the way for everyone who wants to learn this program in this system. Amy's got entire program for you, which is is she calls it the copy and paste formula to monetize your own VIP club.
[00:27:08] And if you want access and Amy, it's start your VIP club.com. I believe correct. Yes. So we're going to, by the way, there's a link to that in the notes. And guys, this is really what you want because look, I mean, anyone can put programs like this together, but I have never seen a broker or REALTOR put this kind of program together who has the level of success that Amy and her team do.
[00:27:32] And it's not like they're only doing massive $10 million plus luxury deals. You know, she said their average price points like, you know, 200, 250,000.
[00:27:41] 340.
[00:27:43] 340. Yeah. So, so that is a very, you know, sort of median price point for a lot of, she's doing a lot of transactions, doing 500 plus transactions a year with her team.
[00:27:55] And guys, she put all this together and she wants you to learn more about this as well. So start your VIP club.com has a lot of this information. There's, there's like, think even a couple different membership options.
[00:28:07] Yeah.
[00:28:07] There's like a one time and then there's monthly and all this. But, you know, it's funny whenever I see these kind of products, it's, it's really never backed by a brokerage or a team that's actually doing a ton of production.
[00:28:20] So I think you have this really unique spot in this very crowded place of we'll show you how to, you know, create this amazing business.
[00:28:28] It's like, oh, I'm actually doing it.
[00:28:30] And, you know, I love that. So start your VIP club.com is where you can learn more about this. But the one thing I wanted to mention, which was, well, couple of things.
[00:28:40] First, having a private Facebook group.
[00:28:42] The only reason I'm mentioning this for your clients, by the way, which Amy has talked about is this is a brilliant thing.
[00:28:48] I've never heard anybody mention this idea. Now here at our brokerage, we have a private Facebook group for our brokers are in Illinois.
[00:28:55] Everyone's, everyone's called a broker. So for our REALTORS and they are, you know, they chat back and forth in there.
[00:29:01] We do trainings in there. We do a lot of celebration stuff. But I never have heard of a REALTOR having that for their clients.
[00:29:07] But it's the same exact idea. It's brilliant because your clients get to know each other. You're probably posting content in there from time to time.
[00:29:15] And your clients get more direct access to you and the other clients. So that in and of itself, I love.
[00:29:21] And that's something really just about anybody could, could put together.
[00:29:24] But I love the fact that you have created this whole program that shows people step by step how to do things like, yeah, you know, I think I do want to offer a van or a storage or a shed with tools.
[00:29:36] So that my clients can use it. The other thing you said that was really fascinating to me.
[00:29:41] And as a somebody who sort of works on the management side of a brokerage, I don't know why we're not doing this, which is you charge your vendors, the ones that you refer to, you charge them to be part of your, you know, preferred vendor list.
[00:29:55] And that is, I've never heard anybody mention that that is such a smart idea because number one, you want to make sure of course that they're that they're committed and these vendors of do a good job, which you've already done.
[00:30:06] But it's like, no, you should have to pay to get access to my clients. My clients are really the most important thing for me. And I want to know that, you know, I'm assuming the thought is that you want these vendors to have some skin in the game so that, you know, that that at least you're receiving some value along the way as well.
[00:30:20] Oh, gosh, yeah. And think about it just as from the REALTOR's perspective, that client is trusting you for, I mean, we play so many roles to these, these beautiful humans who are in a really big, big financial decision in their life. And they trust who you know like and trust.
[00:30:38] And so my home support team people have, have partners have always been so important to me. But I really, I really wanted to offer them to locally, like Sioux Falls, like our state, we don't have a state income tax.
[00:30:49] Like we just have we have a lot of growth coming in because of that we're just, you know, forks is like, we're the best place to, you know, start a business, I think since my since 20 years now, since I've been in the business, you know, it's been so long.
[00:31:01] But I really love growing local too. Like I really love getting back and growing local, you know, it's like, okay, I'm going to help you grow your business because I'm going to show you, I know how to market.
[00:31:10] I'm going to put you into my marketing. I have a whole system that I market for you to keep you in front of the people. And then they stay and they're going to use you. It's just a no brainer. And my home support team partners, I love them. They're so good.
[00:31:23] And my goal this year is to have 125. So do the math on that 3500 dollars a year last year. We were right around that 100 mark. And they, these, and these home support team partners. They're the ones who, you know, also do at space on the back of my truck.
[00:31:37] They're the ones by client events. So we do a really big client events a year. And they're the ones who I have a whole system in my course about this that they pay for my client events. I have a whole sponsorship categories that they can pay for on that.
[00:31:50] So I monetize my client events. And again, if you're not doing client events, you should anyway, because you should be loving on them. But typically I sell anywhere between three to four additional units. Every client event just from again, the law reciprocity and then has you.
[00:32:03] And it is good for my home support team partners to their out there and they come in the ones who are sponsoring their there and they're meeting my clients face to face.
[00:32:10] And so it's a great opportunity.
[00:32:12] And the other thing that you said that I absolutely love and I've sort of been beating the drum on this since I started the podcast, although I'm not a producing agent. So probably nobody listens to me.
[00:32:22] But but my guests, they do listen to so I wanted to make sure they that because you've said so much already that I know a lot of our listeners heads are probably spinning going, oh my god, there's so many good ideas.
[00:32:33] This is a good one that I had. I'm trying to think if anyone would have done almost 500 episodes, my memory's garbage. So maybe somebody said this before, but I don't think so.
[00:32:41] And here's what Amy mentioned and she said it very quickly, but it was really a brilliant nugget in my opinion, which was when she has clients, she's like, oh, by the way, you know, she obviously knows where they work. She knows, you know, probably enough about the office they worked at or a little bit about their business.
[00:32:57] And then Amy's like, hey, who's like the HR person? I want to talk to them and see if I can come in and do a presentation for the other employees, which is absolutely one of the smartest things because you're going to have one of their employees vouching for you and saying, oh my god, you got to have Amy and here she'll bring in lunch.
[00:33:11] And she'll do a little presentation. And that is absolutely brilliant. And nobody else does that.
[00:33:17] Okay, so I'm creating a course on this because we've read the book at the Dream Manager book. No, okay, so the Dream Manager was, I think it was written in 2007 back before the world was the world now, right, where we just had such a hard time with the employees.
[00:33:30] And we own, I have one and I own a handful of businesses. So we know how hard it is to keep keep a track and retain good talent. And so that's basically the concept of that book is that it's getting harder and harder each year to attract and retain good talent.
[00:33:43] So employees and that a happy employee is a productive employee. So what I've done is I created my and my corporate partnership with all of these things with the foundation in my lifetime, home support and I've gone out to companies and just say, here, I want to be a corporate partnership.
[00:33:57] I'm going to offer you all these things for free, all these different parts of my VIP that we haven't talked about all of it. I'm going to offer that for you for free to put into your employee benefit program.
[00:34:06] And you can do this to help you become a better place to work for your employees to just have one more benefit of working for you. We're an offer of different lunch and learns activities because again, statistically, an employee who owns is typically a more productive employee than an employee that rents. It's just a stats is what it is.
[00:34:22] But we come in and we just and we get the opportunity to be in front of these people and in that and then again, I have, you know, the high level, you know, the sea level that I'm getting in front of because we're offering them this.
[00:34:34] Then I also get all the employees to so the lead gen I'm able to give to my agents from from what we're seen from this is fabulous. Like my goals to have 10,000 employees signed up by the end of 23.
[00:34:44] We just signed up a really big one that I'm so excited about that is just going to be a huge thing for us to be able to help them this big company, but also my employees are my my agents.
[00:34:53] I'm going to be able to help them grow their business even bigger than I have because I'm a had more leads coming in for them through this lifetime home support corporate partnership program.
[00:35:03] Yeah, it's it's a wonderful idea.
[00:35:05] Tell us more about the program itself for agents who might want to consider adding in some of not only these processes, but these revenue streams.
[00:35:16] Right, like this is an amazing thing that that you've figured out not just how to because I've had a lot of agents on our show who have amazing processes and strategies and really it's just incredible.
[00:35:28] But they haven't always monetized other parts of the business outside of the actual transaction, which of course is monetized.
[00:35:35] So this idea of monetizing everything else even like you were saying, you know, you know, getting a van and you know getting advertising on it and even that in itself is smart because it's essentially becomes a free thing.
[00:35:47] But tell us more about the program to start your VIP club. Let's I'd love to hear like what do people get and what are the price points for it.
[00:35:54] Okay, so it's basically the only course of its kind that gives so agents single agents team leads brokers a roadmap to creating a VIP club that will turn their clients into referral partners for life.
[00:36:08] It also to walk some through how to monetize each part of it. So from the movie trucks to the party shed to the tool shed to the discount center, I have discounts for all of these and discounts for the products that they can buy as well as what products to buy which ones are the best.
[00:36:22] Then I it's a seven course module. It's a seven module course. Sorry in there and it has a section on each of the pillars for implementing monetizing checklist has a whole operations module has a whole marketing module for your own I have a VIP clubs made for you.
[00:36:38] I have press releases made for you. I have your 30 second elevator speech made for you. I have your first your roll out to your data bank that initial roll out to your data bank.
[00:36:48] I have everything you're going to need to get sponsorship for your client events how to throw a big a big great client event again.
[00:36:55] I'm very system centric so I also in this course gave away as a bonus. So my three of my my high level client event checklist from beginning to end that basically all they have to do is put one thing in an auto populates everything they need to do to run a a profitable client event that their clients are in a love and their agents are going to attend that's the other part of it to get their agents there to really love it.
[00:37:18] So that's included in it. We also have a software like I said that we created for our lifetime home support model so it walks you through how the software works and what it's going to do to save you on employee time and it's going to help keep you and give you more referrals because your clients have a one step shop that they're going to need after the transaction again they're not going to back to your website after the transaction they're just not.
[00:37:38] And so it just gives you a step by step no shiny object like I think our industry is so shiny object don't you like we people throw money and all this stuff and then they don't go back and check the ROI so this is a no shiny object here's here's what you do I'm going to show you how to do it.
[00:37:53] I'm going to give you all the tools you need from the the contracts to sell off your sponsorship for your trucks to your client events to your party and tool ship as well as additional lead generation that goes into it because all of this has additional lead generation.
[00:38:06] I give away all of his stuff to nonprofits for free. I give it away to first responders for free. I give it away I sponsor some schools that I give it away to for free.
[00:38:14] Guess what I get to do I get to go and talk to these people are I get to send in my employees to go and talk to these people and tell them about our lifetime home support model because we're doing that and it's a good community give back I love that again you should want to do that as a business owner.
[00:38:28] But it's a whole circle all around way for them to grow a airtight no worry about any type of market shift type of business.
[00:38:38] So what's what I love specifically going all the way back to one of one of my sort of initial questions was like what are you doing in between the sales well you're basically telling us all of the things that you're doing in between sales cycles which how long and in your like what's the average time where somebody buys or sells.
[00:38:57] A home and then under their next like seven years five to seven years actually three to five in our market. So when you think of the lifetime value of a first time home home buyer they're a fiber you know they're usually five transactions you know so you think about that if that they're five transactions for you as a first time home buyer through the life of your career.
[00:39:14] Then think of how many other referrals you're getting career off of them that's a really delicious career.
[00:39:19] And the fact that you even have a private Facebook group really allows them possibly depending on how how active they are on Facebook to really get almost daily interactions with you right like depending on how much content you guys are putting in there.
[00:39:32] But I was going to ask you like what do you do in between sales well you're doing so many different things where you're just you're constantly in contact and I bet you don't even necessarily have to ask your clients hey are you do you need my help buying or selling something because you're so present in their life.
[00:39:48] They're reaching out to you I imagine you don't even have to ask for the business.
[00:39:52] We know it's it's beautiful we really you know over 70% of of our business comes from repeat and referral business and that's that's a low because I also have an ISA department but my highest ISA lead source is off of calls coming in.
[00:40:08] So those calls coming in are typically off of them either seen stuff that we're posting out there about our lifetime most of our mental or referrals in from past clients.
[00:40:17] And so you know that's alright because then it's then it's Zillow you know so my ISA is next one is Zillow so it's you actually get more inbound calls than Zillow that then you like like purchasing leads from Zillow yeah yeah yeah the kind of the come list me calls or the comes show me a house calls and then think about it though too.
[00:40:35] So we and this is all my course again it's the hook it's the hook they're calling it because they're contacting five to six different other agents so again my agents are trained that if they're out you know the first time they're showing you say a client buyer doesn't want to come in and they're meeting them in the driveway they're handing them the marketing sheet about our lifetime home support and just say hey just buy them all the way by the way this is what else we have to do to help you build wealth or real estate with our lifetime home support model with us in one year you're going to save likely over $10,000 by doing something you're going to do anyway.
[00:41:04] Right amazing what you really have I mean when you say your assistance person you are really a systems person so I imagine one of the main benefits is it just gives agents not just a blueprint of you know sort of how to think about building these systems but it actually tells them what to do on a daily basis.
[00:41:24] Yep so at the end of every module because that's what it is people will take a course and then they won't know what to do so at the end of every module I call my action step checklist the end of every module I have an action step checklist that tells them black and white this is what you need to do to implement what you just learned here's the checklist boom boom boom boom on what you need to do to move to the next step to continue to build that VIP club.
[00:41:49] Yeah it's really amazing and and as far as cost what what is the cost for the start your VIP club 1997.
[00:41:58] Gotcha so just shy of $2,000 and for anyone listening that's like oh that's a lot of money well it's really less than probably a third of one transaction right so yeah it's it's it's a one one time payment you know basically $2,000 and if some if you could you know I think back to because I have to build the systems.
[00:42:18] For our our company in more of the recruiting side and the retention side and I can tell you I spent a lot more than $2,000 putting all of that together over the last 12 years and I would have killed to have somebody hand me a program like that I would have gladly paid way more than $2,000 because it actually pays it doesn't just pay for itself it actually generates incredible amount of revenue.
[00:42:42] Oh my gosh they've got a revenue that you have from this just from your repeat business is in there and then when you think about it's just a system and strategy if you don't have to come over that Mark Twain said there's no such thing as an original idea everything is just out there that just doesn't exist.
[00:42:54] Same thing you take this and it gives you a step by step on how to create it implement it and monetizing quickly and then I also I have a virtual assistant trained in my lifetime home support program that I sell time blocks out to my students to who want to implement faster.
[00:43:12] So my VAs have stepped into my students and help them just go if they don't have either the bandwidth in house right now or they want extra help if somebody who knows everything about this system already they can buy time blocks at my lifetime home support virtual assistants too.
[00:43:27] Yeah that that makes so much sense I was I was at an event yesterday morning here for our local association where we bring in top producers and have them speak to to newer agents and we had about 300 people there and it was just a lot of work.
[00:43:42] It was a wonderful event and somebody grabbed me who I didn't know he a guess he's a fan of the podcast and said speaking of virtual assistants he goes I listen to an episode you did about you know why a virtual assistant makes sense and I finally pulled a trigger did it he goes I've like doubled my business because it's easy easy.
[00:44:01] Easy I tell my each other time that if you're doing it then you're the assistant you don't need to be do you know that my average age and you know like and they're selling you know close to 30 you know in 22 homes a year and so that they they shouldn't be doing those things you know we have I think we have six VAs right now over in the Philippines that that we have and it just helps systemize so many things that we're not worried about.
[00:44:24] We have VAs as well for our for running the back end of our brokerage not client facing VAs but you but but client facing VAs are great too and all of ours are from the Philippines as well and boy I've had been using VAs in the Philippines for six years now I think and just incredible incredible opportunities there that now so globalized we can find great talent from overseas you know
[00:44:54] with an internet connection and it's just it's just amazing and right now just to speak to that I think a lot of agents again and brokers who are just who are frozen in fear and not taking advantage of the opportunity and have let a lot of VAs go so right now there's an influx of the available so again for somebody thinking about that it's right now is a good time to get a VAs trained in nearly every tech stack that's out there.
[00:45:20] Yeah so what would you recommend as a first step for somebody who does feel a little frozen right now they don't have a whole lot of clients everyone's bummed out about interest rates and inventory and obviously mindsets really important so what would you recommend that somebody could do as just like a first step forward to just start recognizing the opportunity that exists this year.
[00:45:47] They need to build their database build their data bank so if they want to email me email me at Amy at Amy stack burger dot com I will send them my data bank builder for free send them out to her them to do to sit down and fill out just their data bank builder that's just going to be memory jobs for them of everybody they know who should be living within their database within their CRM and then they need to turn around and do the next step put them in the CRM and let us start working for them.
[00:46:11] And then are you a big fan of collecting as much data data points as you can to give you a reason to reach out in other words like how I don't know how detailed you get with your with your clients in your CRM but you obviously know where they work as we talked about why that's important and also too you could put Google alerts up for these companies and if you see any major news come through another reason to pick them up.
[00:46:33] So hey I just saw your company won this big deal or whatever so I imagine a lot I mean you've talked about a lot of what you do is real estate adjacent or even not necessarily related to real estate because you're trying to just immerse yourself in their lives which include work life home everything you I imagine you probably have a lot of data points in your CRM for each one of your your data are you say call data banks are yeah we do we keep as much to possibly kind of there and that's a big part.
[00:47:03] I think I tell my agencies to that's one of the benefits are working for our companies our business plan is is set up because I made all the mistakes and so I've set it up so that they don't have to and they can scale easily and don't have to do it the hard way like I did they're able to do it the easy way with everything that we've we've taken care for them because think about it too like I didn't start is I didn't use my CRM to the level I use it now probably 10 years ago think of more way I then my head I'm like oh you're much more success I would have had I used that.
[00:47:33] The way I should have but but then you think of a CRM what are they using for those drip campaigns are they using the built in ones are they going that are they are they putting any of their unique value propositions my course has it all I have a whole drip campaign for every part of it from the from the time they rent something to the
[00:47:50] drip campaign in the funnel they have from when they come in as a new leads or you have the hook in there from a web lead to a past client to a nonprofit to your HST partners all those in there so you're staying top of mind through all the ways you need to.
[00:48:05] Yeah it makes it makes all the sense in the world I don't know how big the rental the residential rental market is in Sioux Falls I don't know if that's a possible source of revenue for agents I hear in Chicago we're in downtown so obviously
[00:48:20] there's tons of rentals and so many agents start out in rentals and so many agents don't and I always encourage agents who aren't like flush with leads especially if they're new which of course nobody is when you start I'm like do as many leads as you can because almost
[00:48:34] everyone that owns used to rent right and I again I don't know if that that may not translate to every market out there but do you see a lot of agents doing
[00:48:42] rentals as a way to just as an entry point in your market to or do you encourage your agents to do that we don't really have the big
[00:48:50] much it's just not even a really a thing here yeah what about supporting local businesses so you talked about having a vendor list do you I would love to know a little
[00:49:02] because this is another thing that anybody can go out and do go ahead tell talk so okay so one of my standards of practice for our
[00:49:07] agents is that they have to be in a performing networking group that meets on a weekly basis so at least group so and and and B&I's are not for
[00:49:17] everybody they're just not that they work for me when I first got into the business basically because I was dirt poor I did not have
[00:49:22] the money for a B&I and it just wasn't the structure that my brain work best in so I created a leads group and I have a system for my
[00:49:30] agents to where they have to be a part of a leads group that again that meets on a weekly basis the benefit of leads groups there's
[00:49:35] exclusivity to your market so it's not like the chamber I sit on the board of our chamber so I love the chamber chambers a big part of our business too but
[00:49:43] it's not like the chamber you have exclusivity in that and you're meeting with all the holidays over the one year you meeting likely like 48 times the investment to be in ours is about
[00:49:51] $45 a month and you have the opportunity to sit down especially as REALTORS once a week and during your 30 second in your 30 second commercial where you're going around and
[00:50:00] you're doing you're giving out all your your listings you get a better bet that I'm telling every seller in my list seller presentation that that's part of my SOPs for my
[00:50:07] agents that we're giving out our listings that everything so again word of mouth marketing that's the second place for buyers fun out about a
[00:50:13] house for sale. That's interesting you're giving out your listings that's very interesting that makes sense.
[00:50:17] Well at the second place buyers fun out about a house for sale is through the REALTORS so that word of mouth needs to be so big and so that's you know a big thing too if you
[00:50:25] and I do have a mini course coming out on that and a blueprint to build a converting leads group but that is such an easy easy build like you could do 10
[00:50:33] transactions a year just from that I typically sell my personal business 3 to 4 million a year for my group that I started back in 2004.
[00:50:40] So so but it's such an easy and again it's rapport bill this relationship building and they're out there you're building their business so they're out there helping you build
[00:50:48] your and again the more eyeballs you have on your listings the better.
[00:50:52] Yeah and you know the vendor the vendor list too is or the partnership list I guess I should say is so important at this meeting I was at yesterday this this white
[00:51:01] or this top producer event one of the one of the agents was they said well where do you where's some of your best referral sources and he said well everyone talks about their existing clients and yes you know good chunk of mind come from there but it's like you know what nobody talks about because it's
[00:51:16] maybe just a little bit slightly sort of uncomfortable he goes divorce attorneys is divorce attorneys are unbelievable and the whole crowd you could see kind of like shuttered like I don't really want to that's dark and kind of you know maybe uncomfortable but it was like he goes oh no no he goes divorce attorneys are first of all they're
[00:51:35] always in business they always have lots of business unfortunate but but or fortunately depending on this situation but regardless they have people who need to move right so this is these are
[00:51:45] huge opportunities to get in to really think about leveraging these relationships and whether you know in earning them so I'd love to I'd love to hear more about some of those partnerships that you have where you're able to provide value like
[00:51:58] obviously on on either end there yeah so even probate to me we have a
[00:52:03] yeah with the attorneys in town for probate because state planning attorneys yeah they have to and that's really one of the reason like my instant offer program so we have all like I
[00:52:11] said systems and strategies for every part of the home buying and selling process for every season so from that least buy out the very first house
[00:52:17] and oftentimes that instant offer program we have is the last house so that's that's a really good program for you know it's typically it's the older child who's taking care of that for their their parents typically at a state
[00:52:30] and so having those relationships with probate attorneys in town to just handle those leads over they're just they're going somewhere we know that they're going to sell
[00:52:37] and that's a that's a good good lead source for us
[00:52:40] wow well I and by the way you know so Amy's a couple of things we want to mention here so Amy's program you know to really create a lifetime lead strategy and have all the systems that by the way she's been working on for
[00:52:54] gosh I'll quite a number of years now and made all the mistakes that you don't have to make because they've already been made and she already knows how to to move past that
[00:53:06] and to get her best practices and again she's one of the top teams in the country this is not this is not a self-help guru that has never actually practiced
[00:53:14] like like somebody like me who goes oh this is what you should do and you're like well DJ you never practice yet don't listen to me but listen to me
[00:53:20] because Amy knows what she is talking about and if you go to start your VIP club.com you can learn more about all of this and guys I don't ever recommend any
[00:53:31] really I mean very rarely do I ever recommend a program for our audience because I don't want our audience investing in something that
[00:53:39] that they are going to come back to me and say why don't like that DJ guy anymore I just spent $2,000 and got nothing no you're going to get a lot with this program and I need to use this program myself
[00:53:49] for some ways I need to better strategize and and and process out our our business and so this this is I I'm going to be a client of this is
[00:53:59] and I'm going to I really I am because I need what here's what I need help with I need help better monetizing our podcast so I'm going to I would like to chat with you off line about that but
[00:54:09] but my point is is Amy has figured all this stuff out so guys if you go to start your VIP club.com
[00:54:15] then you can learn more about it please please consider investing it and I know it's a little bit of money but trust me if it just gets you even just one deal at pace for
[00:54:24] itself and it's going to get you a lot more than that more it's it's not even really about getting one deal and having it pay for it
[00:54:31] it's about setting up systems so that you don't have to wake up every day and go what am I supposed to do what should I do
[00:54:36] because that is a tremendous amount of anxiety you know we I know what that feels like when you don't have processes and systems in
[00:54:44] place it sucks what do you wake up and you're like there's fear there's you just don't know what to do you're sort of flying blind
[00:54:50] out there get a system this is the or well paralysis it's overwhelmed paralysis that's just what happens if there
[00:54:56] isn't a direct checklist on what you need to do that's what happens you know and by the way the other
[00:55:01] thing I'll mention for any agents that are in the Sioux Falls area or are in you know a surrounding area of
[00:55:08] South Dakota and you're like oh I don't work with a team like this Mike my brokerage isn't quite giving me
[00:55:13] these kind of things or I would love to like work with Amy or maybe become a member of her team while she
[00:55:19] obviously doesn't accept every REALTOR that that reaches out but Amy she is her team is growing they
[00:55:25] have 15 agents right now and they are one of the top teams in the entire country I know if I was in
[00:55:29] Sioux Falls South Dakota as an agent I there wouldn't I wouldn't even look elsewhere I'd be like well I
[00:55:35] just want to go with the best so Amy if there is anyone out there and by the way guys remember to that when
[00:55:41] the pandemic happened a lot of people started moving to places that they weren't moving to prior to the
[00:55:47] pandemic Montana Idaho the Dakotas right so you might even if you're not in that local area maybe you
[00:55:54] have referrals of people that are now exploring getting you know you know retirement homes there or
[00:55:59] or you know maybe just moving to because they can work from home so even if you just want to
[00:56:04] refer business to Amy like she would obviously love the opportunity to speak to you but if you are
[00:56:09] an agent in her in her area in Sioux Falls and in that local area and you want to consider
[00:56:15] possibly working or joining up with her team Amy can you tell us a little bit about what you your
[00:56:20] team is looking for in an agent yes and for those who are looking to refer business be going to my
[00:56:24] YouTube channel living in Sioux Falls we have a big book of business for a real I have a very
[00:56:29] dedicated and systemized relocation integration process so I guarantee you'll be taking care of
[00:56:34] to the end degree but yeah what we're looking for in an agent we're looking for agents who are
[00:56:38] there to serve you know again my vision for my companies to build big juicy legacies through
[00:56:42] wealth or real estate with lifetime home support and that's what I want for my agents we have a very
[00:56:46] support driven model so we have the inside transaction management listing coordination inside
[00:56:52] sales department for the generate a lot of leads we pay for the majority of the tech stack to for
[00:56:57] our agents so they can be as as profitable as possible for them and again I've set it up for them
[00:57:02] to build their businesses so they don't have to do with the way I did it that they're going to be
[00:57:05] out there doing what they're best at which is taking care of that client and we have pretty much
[00:57:09] everything else that we're trying to take care of for them on the back side of it so they can
[00:57:13] continue to keep serving more and more clients. Wow so if there if there's an agent that is
[00:57:18] interested in maybe learning more or or providing value to your team or maybe just wanting
[00:57:24] your guidance on what's the best way they should reach out to you? Yep just at Amy at Amy Stackbrookor.com
[00:57:30] or they can go any my handles or at Amy Stackbrookor real estate.com and then for our digital marketing
[00:57:35] and our digital courses it's just ASRE Academy. Yeah ASRE Academy or if you just go to start your
[00:57:42] VIP club.com that'll take you also right there as well to redirect you. We're gonna have links to
[00:57:47] all of this in the show notes so don't worry don't have to write it down it's all in our show notes
[00:57:51] just look for there and we will have it in there but Amy oh my gosh this this is I could have you
[00:57:56] on every single week we could be talking about another process another thing agent should be doing
[00:58:01] and you know what that's not a terrible idea I love it. I love it. You offline. Okay. I think we could
[00:58:08] we could possibly even drill down now everyone we're we're I'm peeling back the curtain for our audience.
[00:58:13] Yeah it's a lot. No no but but this is this is what I'm curious so I was just talking to one of my
[00:58:20] colleagues this morning he was going how's the podcast going now I'll just give everyone a little
[00:58:24] behind the scenes of what it's like to to run a podcast and I would call my podcast a successful
[00:58:30] podcast because it pays for itself we have sponsors we have a pretty sizable audience and I'm
[00:58:36] not saying that as is any sort of brag or what the younger people say flex I'm not doing it for
[00:58:42] that reason which is so silly I'm not I'm not doing it because I'm I'm the person that always
[00:58:46] thinks oh it's no big deal I don't know I'm not that important but we do have a pretty sizable
[00:58:51] audience my point is is I am always wondering what our audience needs now because podcasting is
[00:58:59] largely a one-way communication right I'm list you're you're listing the me and Amy I don't
[00:59:04] often get a lot of feedback we get a lot of lovely fan letters like almost every day we get some
[00:59:08] one or two letters from people it's so sweet but I don't often I don't often know what our listeners
[00:59:14] actually want or need because there's not an easy way to sort of give that feedback so what I'm
[00:59:18] going to ask everyone to do is if you think that this would be really helpful if maybe once a
[00:59:23] month we had Amy on and she did a deep dive into one particular you know pillar or or something
[00:59:28] that just because I think we could create really really a lot of value for our agents or for our
[00:59:35] listeners I shouldn't say and for our the agents at my firm as well but where they they could learn
[00:59:39] some of this stuff because I think this you have so many processes I think this really deserves
[00:59:45] more than than one go around so we could really do a deep dive and learn more so yeah and I'm
[00:59:54] excited as well so guys everyone out there please visit start your VIP club calm also

Okay, today on the show, we have Amy Stockburger with Amy Stockburger real estate in Sioux Falls, South Dakota. Let me tell you more about Amy. Now, Amy and her husband are broker owners of Amy Stockburger real estate and also run a team-erage brokerage model, which I'm excited to learn more about. Now, they have been the highest producing team in the state of South Dakota since 2017 and ranked 23rd in the nation by real trends. They served 559 clients for 171 million in volume back in 2021. That was with 15 agents last year. They did four, a work with 486 clients, 166 million in volume. Now, Amy created a unique and all inclusive lifetime home support system that turns their clients into referral machines, resulting in over 70% of their business sourced from relationship referrals. Amy has also successfully monetized each pillar of her lifetime home support model, which is added a lucrative revenue stream while gaining clients and agent loyalty like no other. To learn more, please visit Amy's website, which is Amy Stockburger.com, which is AMY, STO, CK, B-E-R, G-E-R.com. And by the way, we have a link to that in the show notes. Amy, welcome to the show. Thanks for having me, DJ. I'm glad to be here. We got started a little late because Amy is down in Florida right now. And I was very, very jealous because I will be actually just a couple of hours from where she is starting in a couple days. So I got very excited and we talked a lot about the winter months and how nice it is to get away for a moment or two. But Amy, I'm excited to speak with you and you and your husband's team and all of your agents. You guys are just obviously you're crushing it. So I'm always fascinated by people who are doing really well and our audience loves to hear how you do that and how you started. And I'd love to go all the way back to the beginning of your career in real estate and first learn why real estate. How did you get involved? Why? And what was it like when you first started? You got it. So I got into real estate street out of college. My dad had owned a cobble banker brokerage at the time and did a really excellent thing for me. He got me a job at that time. I made $24,000 a year and I'm the oldest high D high I and he put me in the back office and said, Hey, sink or swim. See what you can do. And he did the best thing for me. He taught me everything from the back end. On the support team part of it and just knowing the administrative part of running a brokerage. And then I fell in love with the industry. I got licensed and I've done about every single position you can do within the real estate industry. So I started out support. I then got licensed and I became a buyer's agent, which at that time was very, very, very new. There was a lot of teams at that point. And then I became a single agent when I'm out on my own. And then quickly started my own team with my sister in a part time assistant. And then my husband joined my business back in 2009. And that's what we really started to scale and take a hobby that paid me and made it into a lucrative career. And then we were team for a long time. And then we started our brokerage in 2019 and still run it as a team or as a brokerage. Yeah, as a team in our brokerage, we call it the team marriage, meaning that we still give all of that support that we really feel agents need. To make them very, very successful in their craft. And my vision is to create big juicy legacies for everybody within my ecosystem by using my lifetime home support foundation. So there's a lot to unpack there. Thank you for that information. I was one thing that really struck me. And again, really speaks to how well you run your brokerage and your team is that you really started this in 2019, which again, you was not a not a chance not an easy year to do much of anything in real estate, right? So the fact that you, you know, during the pandemic were able to put these sort of processes in place and start the foundation of this team, which again, I know you've been working in real estate long time before that. But this idea of doing this in the middle of the pandemic boy, that's what a bold and courageous move. Well, we started the brokerage in 2019. We started our real growth pattern really started in 2009. And we started our lifetime home support, you know, our model of lifetime home support. We started that really in 2015. That's when I really figured out that the way I was doing things, I loved taking care of the client. I loved the experience of the clients, we're getting and I wanted to make sure that we were providing the highest level of service to keep us top of mind for them to have them review it, refer us as much as possible and repeat business. And so that was the really the game changer for us is when we put that into our business. Because then we're we had a process, a system of strategy to help the client before, during and after the home buying and selling process. And there's so much to be said about how that before and after relationship part is could be even more important than that during the transaction relationship part. Yeah, I've always thought that that was probably the maybe the thing I've tried to focus on in the show and talking to guests is I'm not. Well, initially when I first started the show, I was mostly interested in how they treated their clients during a transaction. Because of course, top 1% producers are clearly, you know, providing a level of service and support that maybe other agents aren't. So initially that was my my my main interest when I started the show and then I realized pretty quickly early on that top producers all had very, very impressive strategies for while working with the client. But then I sort of got bored listening to it because it was a lot of the same stuff and then I thought, well, I'm actually more interested in what happens in between sales. Because that's I think where a lot of missed opportunities happen. Obviously, you know, agents oftentimes just forget because they're busy there in the middle of a million other things. And it's like, oh, so and so bought a home three years ago. Yeah, I should probably reach out, but having an actual strategy so that you're staying and touch and providing value is amazing. But I wanted to actually go back to something you said because I always every year I say I'm going to remember to ask guests more about this. And I never do. And I'm so glad because I would have forgotten today, but you you actually just jagged my memory. You were saying that you weren't necessarily super happy with the way you were running things until was it around 2015 when you started really working on your process. So I'm curious is what were you doing back then that you that it's just to identify a problem or an issue that you were having. What were some of the issues you were having that you caused you to want to create a solution for? Well, I was looking at the lifetime value of a client. What is your lifetime value of a client? The value of them throughout your entire career. And it was putting the numbers to that that you know, in a career typically, lifetime value of a client, the times they're going to transact is that you know, in our market 100 to 175,000 dollars. And then what does that look like then for the lifetime value of the referrals of that they're giving us. If if say 10 to 15% of your your sphere is going to transact within 12 months, what's that mean when you you keep, you know, multiplying that success on making sure that your clients are becoming your referral partners. And so when I did in 2015 or before what made me actually start the lifetime home support model that I created is I was running crazy open houses. I was spending, it's, it felt like I had all this money going out on lead generation that the ROI wasn't there. And I just knew that there had to be a better way to take care of my clients so that their experience was top notch. And then I also wanted to make sure that I again had them there for being my referral partners. And then I wanted to monetize it. I that's a big part of my my my systems person. Like I said, hi, hi, there's a system and strategy for every part of our business and having that in place, I decided to put my VIP club in. And so what my VIP club is and I have a lot of different pillars within our business of our lifetime home support. The one we're going to I was going to visit with you about today was that VIP club where our clients get access to all of our pillars or a VIP club before during and after. So lifetime access for free. And so one of the first things I did is I put a moving truck in place 15 foot moving truck in place. Put that there for my clients to serve them before during and after four life they get to use it for free. But I monetized it right away. So I went back and I how did you monetize it? So I figured out what my my debt service was for it and I went and sold that space on the back of it and made money off of my truck. So they so do you purchase the truck or did you lease the truck and like how did you do that? Yeah, I purchased it, but you can leave. So I have created a whole system for other agents to take what it took me. How many years to to to perfect and I always say I have a PhD in failing forward. I've made all the mistakes. So what I've done is created a VIP course start your VIP course.com and it basically it's a copy and paste formula to implement and monetize your VIP club. So agents can go out and take everything that all the material I have. I have a at seven modules. I have it broken down into the blueprint for your 30 second elevator speech about your VIP club. I've it broken down on how to monetize each pillar. So I have a moving truck. I have a party supply. I have a tool shed. I have a discount market center. I have a client event section. I have an agent recruitment section. And then I show them how to monetize each side of that with every system they need within it. Like there's one whole module of just operations because there's so much that happens with all the departments within your company. And if you don't have your systems, you're not going to scale. You need those two or sisters. You need systems to scale. That's just how it works. And so I have a whole module that's just on you. Here's a checklist you need for every part of your business to implement and monetize this VIP program because at the end of the day, your clients are going to remember that experience. And this experience that we're providing, which I'll go deeper into on the next part of it here is that they're going to remember it no matter what if you're there. And you have the systems in place to keep top of mind, you know, Gary Keller said it in the linear real estate that humans have two places in their brain for REALTORS. And it's our jobs to knock the other one out and so that we're staying top of mind. So they're their repeat business and referral business. And so the trucks was the first thing. Monetize those. I have two going to have three here in 23. So monetize those guys. And then I added my party and tool shed almost almost immediately. And so what that is, I have party and tool equipment that they can use. So like think of banquet tables and chairs, commercial grade food, warmers, cotton candy, snow, coal popcorn machines, platters, anything you could think of for a party, bouncy houses, all those things. So clients can come back and use those for free for life. But a big part of this is that I put my brand on everything. So again, with my truck, my clients get to use my trucks. My trucks are a marketing vehicle for me. They get out 600 some, you know, impressions per mile. I bet they're out there. So and then I monetize the back of them. So people, so I make money off of my trucks. And then now it's my party party equipment. So everything that, you know, people for graduations parties, people, my clients can back and use these for life. They throw parties. My name is everywhere. My brand is everywhere. So again, it's more brand awareness, right? They're in there. And I'm able to then, you know, obviously, my clients are referring us because they're getting such value from us. And then there's so many stages of home ownership. So we created our tool shed. Our tool shed has everything you can think of that a client would need for every season of home ownership. So from ladders, wheel barrels, commercial grade paint sprayers, carpet cleaners, you know, the big fans, all those things. Yeah. So basically you guys have all this equipment. Your clients are able to contact you at any time say, hey, I need to borrow a power washer for my deck. Or I need I have a children's party coming up and need a need to I can I use the bouncy house and and then your truck is is there on at the event. I'm assuming or or nearby the event where people can see it. Your name is everywhere. You've monetized the truck. So it pays for itself. And you're getting all this amazing marketing exposure. And you become the person that you're you create the stickiness because your clients are like, oh, Amy's got everything. I'm going to just go to her. I'm one of her clients. That is brilliant. Absolutely brilliant. Then so because because we have we have over it's actually this year. I bet you we're going to be probably 2500 reservations that we're going to have from our clients this year. But because that there's so and again, again, this is your branding yourself. You're serving your clients. That's what you want to do. You're brand new self and then you're monetizing. I monetized all of them. So my party shed tool shed. They're all monetized too. And you're I created software because of that because your clients need a one-stop shop that's just about you. So when you think about the cycle of a buyer seller, they're out on your websites and your socials when they're betting you out. And or when they're looking for houses. That's what they're doing. And that's it. Yeah. They're not coming back to your website again. They're going to Zillow any other time to check the price and see what their homes worth. Yeah. So I created software. My lifetime home support software. So my clients can go out and I I sell up to my students too, where it has everything they need. So you're serving. I'm providing value. They're going and looking at all of the equipment we have. They're renting it on that on my software. So these we can pick it up. It's all set up by systems inside of us so that my FTE, my full-time employee time on this is next in nothing because of this software. So you don't have to actually organize that a lot. It's all done through us. Yep. And then in that software though is set up where I have you know all my my Facebook blog, my Facebook feed. So that's in front of them. Everything to my client event is up there. Everything for my home support team partners, which is another pillar. I'll talk to you about my private Facebook group for them is on there. So I have listings on there. Easy way for us to review review me and my agents. So again, it's it's a place for them to go one step shop that has everything they need. And I'm not selling to them. I'm serving to them. Right. And again, if there's one lead generation that everybody should focus on the most and spend the most amount of money on is their data bank. Their data bank, especially in a market like this in this type of market is an opportunity market for those who. For those who are frozen in fear, they're going to get just they're they're going to get passed by they're going to get passed by right now. And always that market is an opportunity market. And this is who are we're going to go in and pick up market share. That's our market shares 23 you know what climbing is the theme of our year that we're going in and that's you need and you need to do it through your data bank because they are the best for no length and trust you. And the referrals from your data bank are the best referrals to work with. They're almost guaranteed. Yeah. They're guaranteed and they come to you knowing your value and one of the big things too about this lifetime home support model like my ISA department. We have an eight percent, you know, contact to contract conversion rate. You know the market average is like one to two. Explain that to me. I'm sorry. I wasn't not sure I totally understood that my my ISA contract to close right. We have an eight percent conversion contract to close got it. Yeah, so that contract to close sorry from contact to close contact. We got it. Got it. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. So the minute so a lead comes in. So my lifetime home support model is a hook because you have to know that anybody who's going on to any website. They're talking to five to six other brokers too. So my lifetime home support model is the hook that that keeps them with us that hey with us you get access to all of these things for life. And I haven't gone through all of them yet. But this is what we have because we're lifetime home support. We're here to save you time stress and money and where the experts have connecting buyers and sellers and we do that and help you build wealth through real estate with our lifetime home support model. And so again, having this it just look even if you're doing lead generation for your web leads. You have this hook of lifetime home support that keeps them with you. So yes, and boy again, you just said so much as a couple of things I want to I want to dial into because from our listener perspective, you said a couple of things that that really sort of grabbed my attention, which was well actually I'm going to ask you a question. So you said this and you said this very quickly. So I want to sort of rewind back to this particular point because I think this year it's particularly important and and I think you would agree. But I'm curious because you'd mentioned, you know, your database or your sphere of influence, your you call data bank is, you know, the most powerful source of of new business. And what I am curious about is and you'd said a percentage and I just missed it. I know the percentage is 16% that's the number I know, but I don't know which which number I missed the actual. 10 to 15. Yeah. So here's what here's what Amy and I are talking about. So in your database, depending on what numbers you're looking at, we'll say 10 to 15% of the people in your data bank are going to transact in real estate within the next 12 months or Amy correct me if I have that wrong. But something to that effect. So if we if we know that and if first of all, I think there's a lot of agents that have never even put a database together. But if and if you haven't, this is the time to do it, especially this year because Amy's exactly right all the top producers this year, they are gaining market share, they're gaining market share on the agents that are a little bit reluctant are pulling back. And maybe they're a little scared or maybe they're depressed because of the way it interest rates and inventory. But the brokers that are stepping on the gas a little bit realizing tonight, this is the year to deepen relationships are just going to take that market share away from the agents that are pulling back. But what I wanted to say is we're basically you just basically smashed a myth or what are or discredited a myth, which is I don't have enough potential clients know you do because 10 to 15% of the people you already know. Are going to need a real turn in the next 12 months, I guess the question is how what percentage of those 10 to 15% are you actually going to earn or get. And if you just sit back and wait, it's probably going to be a smaller percentage that if you're more proactive. And what I what I'm reason I'm making such a big deal about this, I think this is such a relief to agents that are like, I don't have enough leads, I don't have anything new stuff coming. It's like, OK, that that might be. But you already have this other huge people, you know, group of people that you you could focus on, you know, developing more intimate relationships more more connected relationships with. But anyway, I just wanted to make that point. No, and that's true. And the best real estate business you can build is a relationship based business real estate will always be relationship based. And now is that it's always you should always be doing this, but it's a game changer when you add something like this in to your business because you can scale so quickly and and you're serving. And if you're not in this to serve anyway, it's likely not going to work out for you, but you're serving at such a high level that it becomes a law law reciprocity and our humans are so predictable and the law of reciprocity is just you get something you give something back in kind. That's just how our brains work. And so the our VIP club is such a huge part of our lifetime home support pillars and you know, another part to that, I should say, so we have our party shed our, you know, our trucks. We get those monetized our party shed our tool shed those are all monetized. And again, our tool shed our things, people don't want to buy a render store. We have. And that's just the way they're going to need you know what they're going to need. And in my course, since I've done this for so long, we know and I have it all laid out in there, we know what equipment is good and what is not going to work. We know what equipment is going to last you a summer, which one's going to last you two years. So I have laid that all laid out too because that's that's a trial and error thing, you know, that you just wouldn't know if you hadn't done this process. So I've done that, but then another part of our home support team is our discount center. So I have a relationship with an online discount center that I'm offering up in this that they can go out and our clients get 85 to 25% off over 100. That was in different national big brand names, so like Nike under armor, Walmart, things like that, they get deeper discounts on what they would get products and services. There are already going to buy that we're offering up to our clients. So they can save another $5,300 a year just by using that. And that's so that's, you know, here's another thing we're offering you to save you time, stress and money. And that has a lot of different lead generation in it that I'm using right now for corporate partnerships and building market share on that, which is totally different process, but it's so, so, so lovely because again, relationship base is a relationship based business is the easiest business to scale. And then the next one is my home support team. So again, our clients need so many different services and products throughout all of the seasons of buying and selling, right. So I put together what I feel is the best of the best of vendors within my local market, who are part of my home support team. And they give our clients preferential treatment preferential sometimes pricing and are there to make sure they're giving them legendary care like we do. So think of your obviously lender inspector, you know, those things we have all those, but then it's H back we have carpet cleaners we have home cleaners we have. The interior probably mold remediation. Oh, everything. So, you know, I charge these partners $3,500 a year to be a part of my program. And so my clients have access to it. So I have a huge lead gen or a huge revenue source in this. But it's it's threefold my home support team is threefold in that it really is so beautiful for my clients because that's another value add to my VIP. So they have access to all of my people that I'm keeping in front of them because we have all the systems in to keep them from supporting partners in front of my clients when they need them. They have the discounts they have all of that. But then the second part of it is obviously the revenue generation. And that's another big thing that brokers and team leaders really need to be thinking about this year is what are the revenue streams are you adding into your business. It's very important to have other different revenue streams that you have laying down to continue to keep monetizing your business and building it. And so, so the second part is that we have the revenue stream coming in and then the third part is market share. So part of the requirement for my home support team partners to be a part is that we get to come in and present to their employees. We get to come in and tell them about our lifetime home support model all the things they get would be in any stock for real estate client for life. Once we get in and that one to many presentations and showing them all of our our success strategies because we have a we have a at least buy up program. We have an instant offer program. We have a guaranteed sales program. We would love it or leave it guaranteed. So we have all these systems for every stage that once I get in front of them and I'm telling them about it's far better than anything I can throw on social media. It's far better than anything. It's a one to many and then we have a system where we're staying sticky to where we're keeping our information in front of that employees. So when they have a life change, which is where we give you a service to anybody in a life change, right. That's what we do as REALTORS. That those people are who we can serve. Why would they not call me? They're calling us because we're the broker of choice because we're the ones who are offering the most amount of benefit besides being the leaders and connecting buyers and sellers but everything else they get for life with us. So I just want to all of that was amazing. I wanted to point to something that I have never heard anyone else say. And I'm just going to kind of focus on it because I think it's something that really any of our any of our listeners could possibly implement. Although I will buy the way for everyone who wants to learn this program in this system. Amy's got entire program for you, which is is she calls it the copy and paste formula to monetize your own VIP club. And if you want access and Amy, it's start your VIP club.com. I believe correct. Yes. So we're going to, by the way, there's a link to that in the notes. And guys, this is really what you want because look, I mean, anyone can put programs like this together, but I have never seen a broker or REALTOR put this kind of program together who has the level of success that Amy and her team do. And it's not like they're only doing massive $10 million plus luxury deals. You know, she said their average price points like, you know, 200, 250,000. 340. 340. Yeah. So, so that is a very, you know, sort of median price point for a lot of, she's doing a lot of transactions, doing 500 plus transactions a year with her team. And guys, she put all this together and she wants you to learn more about this as well. So start your VIP club.com has a lot of this information. There's, there's like, think even a couple different membership options. Yeah. There's like a one time and then there's monthly and all this. But, you know, it's funny whenever I see these kind of products, it's, it's really never backed by a brokerage or a team that's actually doing a ton of production. So I think you have this really unique spot in this very crowded place of we'll show you how to, you know, create this amazing business. It's like, oh, I'm actually doing it. And, you know, I love that. So start your VIP club.com is where you can learn more about this. But the one thing I wanted to mention, which was, well, couple of things. First, having a private Facebook group. The only reason I'm mentioning this for your clients, by the way, which Amy has talked about is this is a brilliant thing. I've never heard anybody mention this idea. Now here at our brokerage, we have a private Facebook group for our brokers are in Illinois. Everyone's, everyone's called a broker. So for our REALTORS and they are, you know, they chat back and forth in there. We do trainings in there. We do a lot of celebration stuff. But I never have heard of a REALTOR having that for their clients. But it's the same exact idea. It's brilliant because your clients get to know each other. You're probably posting content in there from time to time. And your clients get more direct access to you and the other clients. So that in and of itself, I love. And that's something really just about anybody could, could put together. But I love the fact that you have created this whole program that shows people step by step how to do things like, yeah, you know, I think I do want to offer a van or a storage or a shed with tools. So that my clients can use it. The other thing you said that was really fascinating to me. And as a somebody who sort of works on the management side of a brokerage, I don't know why we're not doing this, which is you charge your vendors, the ones that you refer to, you charge them to be part of your, you know, preferred vendor list. And that is, I've never heard anybody mention that that is such a smart idea because number one, you want to make sure of course that they're that they're committed and these vendors of do a good job, which you've already done. But it's like, no, you should have to pay to get access to my clients. My clients are really the most important thing for me. And I want to know that, you know, I'm assuming the thought is that you want these vendors to have some skin in the game so that, you know, that that at least you're receiving some value along the way as well. Oh, gosh, yeah. And think about it just as from the REALTOR's perspective, that client is trusting you for, I mean, we play so many roles to these, these beautiful humans who are in a really big, big financial decision in their life. And they trust who you know like and trust. And so my home support team people have, have partners have always been so important to me. But I really, I really wanted to offer them to locally, like Sioux Falls, like our state, we don't have a state income tax. Like we just have we have a lot of growth coming in because of that we're just, you know, forks is like, we're the best place to, you know, start a business, I think since my since 20 years now, since I've been in the business, you know, it's been so long. But I really love growing local too. Like I really love getting back and growing local, you know, it's like, okay, I'm going to help you grow your business because I'm going to show you, I know how to market. I'm going to put you into my marketing. I have a whole system that I market for you to keep you in front of the people. And then they stay and they're going to use you. It's just a no brainer. And my home support team partners, I love them. They're so good. And my goal this year is to have 125. So do the math on that 3500 dollars a year last year. We were right around that 100 mark. And they, these, and these home support team partners. They're the ones who, you know, also do at space on the back of my truck. They're the ones by client events. So we do a really big client events a year. And they're the ones who I have a whole system in my course about this that they pay for my client events. I have a whole sponsorship categories that they can pay for on that. So I monetize my client events. And again, if you're not doing client events, you should anyway, because you should be loving on them. But typically I sell anywhere between three to four additional units. Every client event just from again, the law reciprocity and then has you. And it is good for my home support team partners to their out there and they come in the ones who are sponsoring their there and they're meeting my clients face to face. And so it's a great opportunity. And the other thing that you said that I absolutely love and I've sort of been beating the drum on this since I started the podcast, although I'm not a producing agent. So probably nobody listens to me. But but my guests, they do listen to so I wanted to make sure they that because you've said so much already that I know a lot of our listeners heads are probably spinning going, oh my god, there's so many good ideas. This is a good one that I had. I'm trying to think if anyone would have done almost 500 episodes, my memory's garbage. So maybe somebody said this before, but I don't think so. And here's what Amy mentioned and she said it very quickly, but it was really a brilliant nugget in my opinion, which was when she has clients, she's like, oh, by the way, you know, she obviously knows where they work. She knows, you know, probably enough about the office they worked at or a little bit about their business. And then Amy's like, hey, who's like the HR person? I want to talk to them and see if I can come in and do a presentation for the other employees, which is absolutely one of the smartest things because you're going to have one of their employees vouching for you and saying, oh my god, you got to have Amy and here she'll bring in lunch. And she'll do a little presentation. And that is absolutely brilliant. And nobody else does that. Okay, so I'm creating a course on this because we've read the book at the Dream Manager book. No, okay, so the Dream Manager was, I think it was written in 2007 back before the world was the world now, right, where we just had such a hard time with the employees. And we own, I have one and I own a handful of businesses. So we know how hard it is to keep keep a track and retain good talent. And so that's basically the concept of that book is that it's getting harder and harder each year to attract and retain good talent. So employees and that a happy employee is a productive employee. So what I've done is I created my and my corporate partnership with all of these things with the foundation in my lifetime, home support and I've gone out to companies and just say, here, I want to be a corporate partnership. I'm going to offer you all these things for free, all these different parts of my VIP that we haven't talked about all of it. I'm going to offer that for you for free to put into your employee benefit program. And you can do this to help you become a better place to work for your employees to just have one more benefit of working for you. We're an offer of different lunch and learns activities because again, statistically, an employee who owns is typically a more productive employee than an employee that rents. It's just a stats is what it is. But we come in and we just and we get the opportunity to be in front of these people and in that and then again, I have, you know, the high level, you know, the sea level that I'm getting in front of because we're offering them this. Then I also get all the employees to so the lead gen I'm able to give to my agents from from what we're seen from this is fabulous. Like my goals to have 10,000 employees signed up by the end of 23. We just signed up a really big one that I'm so excited about that is just going to be a huge thing for us to be able to help them this big company, but also my employees are my my agents. I'm going to be able to help them grow their business even bigger than I have because I'm a had more leads coming in for them through this lifetime home support corporate partnership program. Yeah, it's it's a wonderful idea. Tell us more about the program itself for agents who might want to consider adding in some of not only these processes, but these revenue streams. Right, like this is an amazing thing that that you've figured out not just how to because I've had a lot of agents on our show who have amazing processes and strategies and really it's just incredible. But they haven't always monetized other parts of the business outside of the actual transaction, which of course is monetized. So this idea of monetizing everything else even like you were saying, you know, you know, getting a van and you know getting advertising on it and even that in itself is smart because it's essentially becomes a free thing. But tell us more about the program to start your VIP club. Let's I'd love to hear like what do people get and what are the price points for it. Okay, so it's basically the only course of its kind that gives so agents single agents team leads brokers a roadmap to creating a VIP club that will turn their clients into referral partners for life. It also to walk some through how to monetize each part of it. So from the movie trucks to the party shed to the tool shed to the discount center, I have discounts for all of these and discounts for the products that they can buy as well as what products to buy which ones are the best. Then I it's a seven course module. It's a seven module course. Sorry in there and it has a section on each of the pillars for implementing monetizing checklist has a whole operations module has a whole marketing module for your own I have a VIP clubs made for you. I have press releases made for you. I have your 30 second elevator speech made for you. I have your first your roll out to your data bank that initial roll out to your data bank. I have everything you're going to need to get sponsorship for your client events how to throw a big a big great client event again. I'm very system centric so I also in this course gave away as a bonus. So my three of my my high level client event checklist from beginning to end that basically all they have to do is put one thing in an auto populates everything they need to do to run a a profitable client event that their clients are in a love and their agents are going to attend that's the other part of it to get their agents there to really love it. So that's included in it. We also have a software like I said that we created for our lifetime home support model so it walks you through how the software works and what it's going to do to save you on employee time and it's going to help keep you and give you more referrals because your clients have a one step shop that they're going to need after the transaction again they're not going to back to your website after the transaction they're just not. And so it just gives you a step by step no shiny object like I think our industry is so shiny object don't you like we people throw money and all this stuff and then they don't go back and check the ROI so this is a no shiny object here's here's what you do I'm going to show you how to do it. I'm going to give you all the tools you need from the the contracts to sell off your sponsorship for your trucks to your client events to your party and tool ship as well as additional lead generation that goes into it because all of this has additional lead generation. I give away all of his stuff to nonprofits for free. I give it away to first responders for free. I give it away I sponsor some schools that I give it away to for free. Guess what I get to do I get to go and talk to these people are I get to send in my employees to go and talk to these people and tell them about our lifetime home support model because we're doing that and it's a good community give back I love that again you should want to do that as a business owner. But it's a whole circle all around way for them to grow a airtight no worry about any type of market shift type of business. So what's what I love specifically going all the way back to one of one of my sort of initial questions was like what are you doing in between the sales well you're basically telling us all of the things that you're doing in between sales cycles which how long and in your like what's the average time where somebody buys or sells. A home and then under their next like seven years five to seven years actually three to five in our market. So when you think of the lifetime value of a first time home home buyer they're a fiber you know they're usually five transactions you know so you think about that if that they're five transactions for you as a first time home buyer through the life of your career. Then think of how many other referrals you're getting career off of them that's a really delicious career. And the fact that you even have a private Facebook group really allows them possibly depending on how how active they are on Facebook to really get almost daily interactions with you right like depending on how much content you guys are putting in there. But I was going to ask you like what do you do in between sales well you're doing so many different things where you're just you're constantly in contact and I bet you don't even necessarily have to ask your clients hey are you do you need my help buying or selling something because you're so present in their life. They're reaching out to you I imagine you don't even have to ask for the business. We know it's it's beautiful we really you know over 70% of of our business comes from repeat and referral business and that's that's a low because I also have an ISA department but my highest ISA lead source is off of calls coming in. So those calls coming in are typically off of them either seen stuff that we're posting out there about our lifetime most of our mental or referrals in from past clients. And so you know that's alright because then it's then it's Zillow you know so my ISA is next one is Zillow so it's you actually get more inbound calls than Zillow that then you like like purchasing leads from Zillow yeah yeah yeah the kind of the come list me calls or the comes show me a house calls and then think about it though too. So we and this is all my course again it's the hook it's the hook they're calling it because they're contacting five to six different other agents so again my agents are trained that if they're out you know the first time they're showing you say a client buyer doesn't want to come in and they're meeting them in the driveway they're handing them the marketing sheet about our lifetime home support and just say hey just buy them all the way by the way this is what else we have to do to help you build wealth or real estate with our lifetime home support model with us in one year you're going to save likely over $10,000 by doing something you're going to do anyway. Right amazing what you really have I mean when you say your assistance person you are really a systems person so I imagine one of the main benefits is it just gives agents not just a blueprint of you know sort of how to think about building these systems but it actually tells them what to do on a daily basis. Yep so at the end of every module because that's what it is people will take a course and then they won't know what to do so at the end of every module I call my action step checklist the end of every module I have an action step checklist that tells them black and white this is what you need to do to implement what you just learned here's the checklist boom boom boom boom on what you need to do to move to the next step to continue to build that VIP club. Yeah it's really amazing and and as far as cost what what is the cost for the start your VIP club 1997. Gotcha so just shy of $2,000 and for anyone listening that's like oh that's a lot of money well it's really less than probably a third of one transaction right so yeah it's it's it's a one one time payment you know basically $2,000 and if some if you could you know I think back to because I have to build the systems. For our our company in more of the recruiting side and the retention side and I can tell you I spent a lot more than $2,000 putting all of that together over the last 12 years and I would have killed to have somebody hand me a program like that I would have gladly paid way more than $2,000 because it actually pays it doesn't just pay for itself it actually generates incredible amount of revenue. Oh my gosh they've got a revenue that you have from this just from your repeat business is in there and then when you think about it's just a system and strategy if you don't have to come over that Mark Twain said there's no such thing as an original idea everything is just out there that just doesn't exist. Same thing you take this and it gives you a step by step on how to create it implement it and monetizing quickly and then I also I have a virtual assistant trained in my lifetime home support program that I sell time blocks out to my students to who want to implement faster. So my VAs have stepped into my students and help them just go if they don't have either the bandwidth in house right now or they want extra help if somebody who knows everything about this system already they can buy time blocks at my lifetime home support virtual assistants too. Yeah that that makes so much sense I was I was at an event yesterday morning here for our local association where we bring in top producers and have them speak to to newer agents and we had about 300 people there and it was just a lot of work. It was a wonderful event and somebody grabbed me who I didn't know he a guess he's a fan of the podcast and said speaking of virtual assistants he goes I listen to an episode you did about you know why a virtual assistant makes sense and I finally pulled a trigger did it he goes I've like doubled my business because it's easy easy. Easy I tell my each other time that if you're doing it then you're the assistant you don't need to be do you know that my average age and you know like and they're selling you know close to 30 you know in 22 homes a year and so that they they shouldn't be doing those things you know we have I think we have six VAs right now over in the Philippines that that we have and it just helps systemize so many things that we're not worried about. We have VAs as well for our for running the back end of our brokerage not client facing VAs but you but but client facing VAs are great too and all of ours are from the Philippines as well and boy I've had been using VAs in the Philippines for six years now I think and just incredible incredible opportunities there that now so globalized we can find great talent from overseas you know with an internet connection and it's just it's just amazing and right now just to speak to that I think a lot of agents again and brokers who are just who are frozen in fear and not taking advantage of the opportunity and have let a lot of VAs go so right now there's an influx of the available so again for somebody thinking about that it's right now is a good time to get a VAs trained in nearly every tech stack that's out there. Yeah so what would you recommend as a first step for somebody who does feel a little frozen right now they don't have a whole lot of clients everyone's bummed out about interest rates and inventory and obviously mindsets really important so what would you recommend that somebody could do as just like a first step forward to just start recognizing the opportunity that exists this year. They need to build their database build their data bank so if they want to email me email me at Amy at Amy stack burger dot com I will send them my data bank builder for free send them out to her them to do to sit down and fill out just their data bank builder that's just going to be memory jobs for them of everybody they know who should be living within their database within their CRM and then they need to turn around and do the next step put them in the CRM and let us start working for them. And then are you a big fan of collecting as much data data points as you can to give you a reason to reach out in other words like how I don't know how detailed you get with your with your clients in your CRM but you obviously know where they work as we talked about why that's important and also too you could put Google alerts up for these companies and if you see any major news come through another reason to pick them up. So hey I just saw your company won this big deal or whatever so I imagine a lot I mean you've talked about a lot of what you do is real estate adjacent or even not necessarily related to real estate because you're trying to just immerse yourself in their lives which include work life home everything you I imagine you probably have a lot of data points in your CRM for each one of your your data are you say call data banks are yeah we do we keep as much to possibly kind of there and that's a big part. I think I tell my agencies to that's one of the benefits are working for our companies our business plan is is set up because I made all the mistakes and so I've set it up so that they don't have to and they can scale easily and don't have to do it the hard way like I did they're able to do it the easy way with everything that we've we've taken care for them because think about it too like I didn't start is I didn't use my CRM to the level I use it now probably 10 years ago think of more way I then my head I'm like oh you're much more success I would have had I used that. The way I should have but but then you think of a CRM what are they using for those drip campaigns are they using the built in ones are they going that are they are they putting any of their unique value propositions my course has it all I have a whole drip campaign for every part of it from the from the time they rent something to the drip campaign in the funnel they have from when they come in as a new leads or you have the hook in there from a web lead to a past client to a nonprofit to your HST partners all those in there so you're staying top of mind through all the ways you need to. Yeah it makes it makes all the sense in the world I don't know how big the rental the residential rental market is in Sioux Falls I don't know if that's a possible source of revenue for agents I hear in Chicago we're in downtown so obviously there's tons of rentals and so many agents start out in rentals and so many agents don't and I always encourage agents who aren't like flush with leads especially if they're new which of course nobody is when you start I'm like do as many leads as you can because almost everyone that owns used to rent right and I again I don't know if that that may not translate to every market out there but do you see a lot of agents doing rentals as a way to just as an entry point in your market to or do you encourage your agents to do that we don't really have the big much it's just not even a really a thing here yeah what about supporting local businesses so you talked about having a vendor list do you I would love to know a little because this is another thing that anybody can go out and do go ahead tell talk so okay so one of my standards of practice for our agents is that they have to be in a performing networking group that meets on a weekly basis so at least group so and and and B&I's are not for everybody they're just not that they work for me when I first got into the business basically because I was dirt poor I did not have the money for a B&I and it just wasn't the structure that my brain work best in so I created a leads group and I have a system for my agents to where they have to be a part of a leads group that again that meets on a weekly basis the benefit of leads groups there's exclusivity to your market so it's not like the chamber I sit on the board of our chamber so I love the chamber chambers a big part of our business too but it's not like the chamber you have exclusivity in that and you're meeting with all the holidays over the one year you meeting likely like 48 times the investment to be in ours is about $45 a month and you have the opportunity to sit down especially as REALTORS once a week and during your 30 second in your 30 second commercial where you're going around and you're doing you're giving out all your your listings you get a better bet that I'm telling every seller in my list seller presentation that that's part of my SOPs for my agents that we're giving out our listings that everything so again word of mouth marketing that's the second place for buyers fun out about a house for sale. That's interesting you're giving out your listings that's very interesting that makes sense. Well at the second place buyers fun out about a house for sale is through the REALTORS so that word of mouth needs to be so big and so that's you know a big thing too if you and I do have a mini course coming out on that and a blueprint to build a converting leads group but that is such an easy easy build like you could do 10 transactions a year just from that I typically sell my personal business 3 to 4 million a year for my group that I started back in 2004. So so but it's such an easy and again it's rapport bill this relationship building and they're out there you're building their business so they're out there helping you build your and again the more eyeballs you have on your listings the better. Yeah and you know the vendor the vendor list too is or the partnership list I guess I should say is so important at this meeting I was at yesterday this this white or this top producer event one of the one of the agents was they said well where do you where's some of your best referral sources and he said well everyone talks about their existing clients and yes you know good chunk of mind come from there but it's like you know what nobody talks about because it's maybe just a little bit slightly sort of uncomfortable he goes divorce attorneys is divorce attorneys are unbelievable and the whole crowd you could see kind of like shuttered like I don't really want to that's dark and kind of you know maybe uncomfortable but it was like he goes oh no no he goes divorce attorneys are first of all they're always in business they always have lots of business unfortunate but but or fortunately depending on this situation but regardless they have people who need to move right so this is these are huge opportunities to get in to really think about leveraging these relationships and whether you know in earning them so I'd love to I'd love to hear more about some of those partnerships that you have where you're able to provide value like obviously on on either end there yeah so even probate to me we have a yeah with the attorneys in town for probate because state planning attorneys yeah they have to and that's really one of the reason like my instant offer program so we have all like I said systems and strategies for every part of the home buying and selling process for every season so from that least buy out the very first house and oftentimes that instant offer program we have is the last house so that's that's a really good program for you know it's typically it's the older child who's taking care of that for their their parents typically at a state and so having those relationships with probate attorneys in town to just handle those leads over they're just they're going somewhere we know that they're going to sell and that's a that's a good good lead source for us wow well I and by the way you know so Amy's a couple of things we want to mention here so Amy's program you know to really create a lifetime lead strategy and have all the systems that by the way she's been working on for gosh I'll quite a number of years now and made all the mistakes that you don't have to make because they've already been made and she already knows how to to move past that and to get her best practices and again she's one of the top teams in the country this is not this is not a self-help guru that has never actually practiced like like somebody like me who goes oh this is what you should do and you're like well DJ you never practice yet don't listen to me but listen to me because Amy knows what she is talking about and if you go to start your VIP club.com you can learn more about all of this and guys I don't ever recommend any really I mean very rarely do I ever recommend a program for our audience because I don't want our audience investing in something that that they are going to come back to me and say why don't like that DJ guy anymore I just spent $2,000 and got nothing no you're going to get a lot with this program and I need to use this program myself for some ways I need to better strategize and and and process out our our business and so this this is I I'm going to be a client of this is and I'm going to I really I am because I need what here's what I need help with I need help better monetizing our podcast so I'm going to I would like to chat with you off line about that but but my point is is Amy has figured all this stuff out so guys if you go to start your VIP club.com then you can learn more about it please please consider investing it and I know it's a little bit of money but trust me if it just gets you even just one deal at pace for itself and it's going to get you a lot more than that more it's it's not even really about getting one deal and having it pay for it it's about setting up systems so that you don't have to wake up every day and go what am I supposed to do what should I do because that is a tremendous amount of anxiety you know we I know what that feels like when you don't have processes and systems in place it sucks what do you wake up and you're like there's fear there's you just don't know what to do you're sort of flying blind out there get a system this is the or well paralysis it's overwhelmed paralysis that's just what happens if there isn't a direct checklist on what you need to do that's what happens you know and by the way the other thing I'll mention for any agents that are in the Sioux Falls area or are in you know a surrounding area of South Dakota and you're like oh I don't work with a team like this Mike my brokerage isn't quite giving me these kind of things or I would love to like work with Amy or maybe become a member of her team while she obviously doesn't accept every REALTOR that that reaches out but Amy she is her team is growing they have 15 agents right now and they are one of the top teams in the entire country I know if I was in Sioux Falls South Dakota as an agent I there wouldn't I wouldn't even look elsewhere I'd be like well I just want to go with the best so Amy if there is anyone out there and by the way guys remember to that when the pandemic happened a lot of people started moving to places that they weren't moving to prior to the pandemic Montana Idaho the Dakotas right so you might even if you're not in that local area maybe you have referrals of people that are now exploring getting you know you know retirement homes there or or you know maybe just moving to because they can work from home so even if you just want to refer business to Amy like she would obviously love the opportunity to speak to you but if you are an agent in her in her area in Sioux Falls and in that local area and you want to consider possibly working or joining up with her team Amy can you tell us a little bit about what you your team is looking for in an agent yes and for those who are looking to refer business be going to my YouTube channel living in Sioux Falls we have a big book of business for a real I have a very dedicated and systemized relocation integration process so I guarantee you'll be taking care of to the end degree but yeah what we're looking for in an agent we're looking for agents who are there to serve you know again my vision for my companies to build big juicy legacies through wealth or real estate with lifetime home support and that's what I want for my agents we have a very support driven model so we have the inside transaction management listing coordination inside sales department for the generate a lot of leads we pay for the majority of the tech stack to for our agents so they can be as as profitable as possible for them and again I've set it up for them to build their businesses so they don't have to do with the way I did it that they're going to be out there doing what they're best at which is taking care of that client and we have pretty much everything else that we're trying to take care of for them on the back side of it so they can continue to keep serving more and more clients. Wow so if there if there's an agent that is interested in maybe learning more or or providing value to your team or maybe just wanting your guidance on what's the best way they should reach out to you? Yep just at Amy at Amy Stackbrookor.com or they can go any my handles or at Amy Stackbrookor real estate.com and then for our digital marketing and our digital courses it's just ASRE Academy. Yeah ASRE Academy or if you just go to start your VIP club.com that'll take you also right there as well to redirect you. We're gonna have links to all of this in the show notes so don't worry don't have to write it down it's all in our show notes just look for there and we will have it in there but Amy oh my gosh this this is I could have you on every single week we could be talking about another process another thing agent should be doing and you know what that's not a terrible idea I love it. I love it. You offline. Okay. I think we could we could possibly even drill down now everyone we're we're I'm peeling back the curtain for our audience. Yeah it's a lot. No no but but this is this is what I'm curious so I was just talking to one of my colleagues this morning he was going how's the podcast going now I'll just give everyone a little behind the scenes of what it's like to to run a podcast and I would call my podcast a successful podcast because it pays for itself we have sponsors we have a pretty sizable audience and I'm not saying that as is any sort of brag or what the younger people say flex I'm not doing it for that reason which is so silly I'm not I'm not doing it because I'm I'm the person that always thinks oh it's no big deal I don't know I'm not that important but we do have a pretty sizable audience my point is is I am always wondering what our audience needs now because podcasting is largely a one-way communication right I'm list you're you're listing the me and Amy I don't often get a lot of feedback we get a lot of lovely fan letters like almost every day we get some one or two letters from people it's so sweet but I don't often I don't often know what our listeners actually want or need because there's not an easy way to sort of give that feedback so what I'm going to ask everyone to do is if you think that this would be really helpful if maybe once a month we had Amy on and she did a deep dive into one particular you know pillar or or something that just because I think we could create really really a lot of value for our agents or for our listeners I shouldn't say and for our the agents at my firm as well but where they they could learn some of this stuff because I think this you have so many processes I think this really deserves more than than one go around so we could really do a deep dive and learn more so yeah and I'm excited as well so guys everyone out there please visit start your VIP club calm also at Amy stockburger calm is another place again just go to the show notes we'll click on the links there's so much great content there a lot of it's free by the way too I'm Amy's very very generous
