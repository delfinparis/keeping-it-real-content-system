[00:01:25] Hello and welcome to another episode of Keeping It Real, the largest podcast made by Real
[00:01:30] Estate agents and for Real Estate agents.
[00:01:33] My name is DJ Paris.
[00:01:34] I am your guide and host through the show.
[00:01:37] And in just a moment, we're going to be speaking with top producer Cyrus Surrage.
[00:01:41] But before we get to Cyrus, just I actually got a quick announcement for you.
[00:01:44] Well, before the announcement, I want to say thank you, of course, to everyone listening.
[00:01:48] Thank you for supporting the podcast, support our sponsors.
[00:01:51] Please tell a friend, like and subscribe.
[00:01:53] Okay, here's the announcement.
[00:01:55] This is kind of embarrassing to admit.
[00:01:57] I've had a million different social media experts on the show over the years to tell agents
[00:02:02] exactly how they should be ramping up their social activity and engagement.
[00:02:07] And I myself have not done it as well.
[00:02:10] So if you're out there listening to some of our episodes and going, gosh, I need to take
[00:02:13] some of that and put it into practice.
[00:02:15] Yeah, I do this.
[00:02:16] I need to do the same.
[00:02:17] So finally, after five or six years of the show, we are going to start clipping our episodes
[00:02:22] and putting those on social media.
[00:02:25] So what that means is, you know, each of our episodes is usually like 45 minutes to
[00:02:29] an hour long.
[00:02:31] And obviously not everybody listens to every minute of that hour.
[00:02:35] And as much as we would love it if they did, of course, people are busy.
[00:02:38] So what we're going to do is we have, I've now hired somebody to start going through the
[00:02:42] episodes.
[00:02:43] Yes, we are going to continue to release full episodes.
[00:02:45] And that's where the majority of you are going to listen.
[00:02:47] But we wanted to give you some of the highlights of those.
[00:02:50] So we're going to find the best segments or the best moments of the show, usually 30 to
[00:02:55] 60 second clips.
[00:02:56] And we're going to be pushing those out on all the social platforms, including TikTok,
[00:03:00] Instagram, YouTube, LinkedIn.
[00:03:03] I think I just said LinkedIn twice, Facebook, of course, as well.
[00:03:06] So anyway, everywhere we're going to start pushing out these short form clips.
[00:03:09] Stay tuned.
[00:03:10] We'll be doing an official launch for that shortly.
[00:03:13] And we'd love your support there.
[00:03:15] So hopefully that'll help you kind of remember these like important little tips and tricks
[00:03:20] distilled down to 30 and 60 second clips.
[00:03:22] So again, we'll be promoting that shortly once we officially launch it.
[00:03:27] And I'll be talking a lot about our social channels to help get you guys subscribed to that
[00:03:31] so that you can get daily doses of some of this information.
[00:03:34] And we have about 500 episodes to go back through and clip out.
[00:03:37] So we got a lot of content.
[00:03:39] So anyway, this was a long intro.
[00:03:41] I appreciate you listening to stay tuned.
[00:03:43] Some really exciting things happening on the show.
[00:03:46] And let's get to it.
[00:03:47] A main event I've kept you long enough.
[00:03:49] My conversation with Cyrus Sirosh.
[00:04:05] Today on the show we have Cyrus Sirosh with M.G. Group Chicago with Berkshire Halfaway
[00:04:11] Home Services.
[00:04:12] Let me tell you more about Cyrus.
[00:04:14] Now, Cyrus joined the M.G. Group.
[00:04:16] By the way, if you're a local Chicago person, that's the Mario Greco Group.
[00:04:19] You might know it by that name.
[00:04:20] But he joined the Mario Greco Group in 2016.
[00:04:24] He was born and raised in Chicago and Northwest suburbs and spent most of his childhood alongside
[00:04:30] his father rehabbing apartment buildings and single family homes.
[00:04:34] Cyrus graduated with a Bachelor of Science from Loyola University and later attained a JD
[00:04:40] from Loyola's School of Law with a focus in real estate.
[00:04:44] Since 2004, Cyrus is focused on commercial and residential sales, leasing and management
[00:04:49] alongside 10 years of experience as a loan originator and processor and brings an all-basis
[00:04:55] covered approach to his clients to ensure the highest quality of representation.
[00:05:00] Cyrus, welcome to the show.
[00:05:02] Glad to have you.
[00:05:03] Great to be here.
[00:05:05] Great to have you.
[00:05:06] So you went from rehabbing homes with your father to then going and getting your law
[00:05:12] degree and back into real estate, sort of doing mortgages and then kind of see, you've
[00:05:17] been involved in the real estate industry ever since you were little.
[00:05:22] Ever since I was mowing the lawn for my dad at 12 in front of the apartment buildings,
[00:05:27] yes.
[00:05:29] Sure.
[00:05:29] Well, tell us how you got how you decided to.
[00:05:32] So when you went to law school, was that was the thought were you were real, wanted to
[00:05:36] be a real estate attorney or were you wanting to go a different direction with law?
[00:05:39] Well, tell you the truth, I was actually pre-med in undergrad.
[00:05:44] I wanted to be a doctor by the time I got to my senior year and actually started volunteering
[00:05:50] in the hospitals and got employed as an EMT and was out in the field.
[00:05:56] I realized I don't have the stomach for this.
[00:06:01] I've come to respect physicians and what they do.
[00:06:05] It just wasn't the right fit for me and then I went into finance with my father.
[00:06:10] He's a self-made man.
[00:06:12] So he started so mortgage brokerage.
[00:06:14] So straight out of college, even during college, I was helping him out.
[00:06:18] I'm a kind of a numbers guy.
[00:06:20] I love math.
[00:06:21] That's where my skills are strongest.
[00:06:25] So I was enjoying doing finance with him for several years.
[00:06:31] Back then, you didn't need an originator's license and it was kind of the Wild West if you recall.
[00:06:37] So of course, I got into brokering real estate transactions at the same time.
[00:06:42] The glory days, finance the deal, broker the deal.
[00:06:46] Get some experience on that front as well.
[00:06:50] Actually, it didn't go to law school until the market crashed.
[00:06:53] In08, I had a couple zero quarters and realized I might need another career.
[00:06:59] That's when I got into that.
[00:07:02] And fortunately, I, you know, with my passion for real estate,
[00:07:06] by the time I finished school, the market had rebounded a bit and I was able to kind of get some traction again and decided, OK.
[00:07:15] I didn't necessarily want to become an attorney.
[00:07:18] So I was happy to get back into the real estate field just with another kind of tool in the tool belt, another skill.
[00:07:28] I do feel there's a lot of value and having experience in all the facets of a real estate transaction.
[00:07:34] So that was just one more kind of check on the box of what I could help advise on not taking the role of an attorney,
[00:07:43] not taking the role of a loan officer, but at least being a soundboard for my clients if they do want a second opinion or want to bounce ideas off me.
[00:07:53] Is this, does this at least sound right to you or trusting in my referrals a little bit more knowing that I have that background and some experience in those fields.
[00:08:05] Yeah, it's amazing.
[00:08:06] You really, it's incredible that it's incredible to go just back to college for a second because I did the pre-med thing for a one semester.
[00:08:15] And then I was like, oh, this is really, really a difficult track.
[00:08:19] And thankfully got out before I got into like organic and organic chemistry and you made it all the way through those and then we're like,
[00:08:36] I also, I really want to chat with you because you have a kind of an interesting trajectory. I think we were talking about this.
[00:08:42] Well, we actually didn't talk about this ahead of time, but you'd sent this over and some information that we requested. And I thought this was particularly interesting because, you know, this idea of the one of the big questions that our audience is always asking when they write this in all the time to us, which is, you know, hey, I'm an individual practitioner.
[00:09:00] And I'm thinking about either starting a team or joining a team. And of course, you know, there's, depending on, you know, what what their goals are and how long they've been in the business and where they're struggling and all of those things would sort of help somebody make a better decision around that, but you've done both.
[00:09:16] And you've done it in a way that's, I think kind of unique. So I'm really interested in digging into that a little bit.
[00:09:22] So if I understand correctly, the first 11 years of your career, you were solo practitioner. And then in the last eight years, you joined the Mario Greco team, which again, Mario Greco group, I should say, rather, which is, by the way, here in Chicago, one of the pre-eminent groups highly respected, great people.
[00:09:40] They've got an amazing team. They're one of the big boys here in Chicago. So I'm excited to learn what it was like on your own. And obviously you were successful there. And then making figuring out that, oh, I think I do want to be involved with with a larger group. And I'm just curious on any advice you might have to people who are thinking about that.
[00:09:58] But let's start at the beginning. So you started out as an individual, you know, independent agent. And then tell us how that process went, you know, like as you were growing. And then what, at what point did you sort of say, I think it's time that I get some additional resources and support and think about joining a team.
[00:10:16] Sure.
[00:10:18] Yeah, started in a kind of went in the reverse direction that most people go, I think. Yeah, it's going to say. Yeah.
[00:10:23] This day and age, they, they join a team because they feel it's, it's necessary. They want the accelerated learning curve. They need to build a book and the opportunities that a team leader can provide. And then, you know, mentality being, I hit a certain threshold that I can go out on my own and, you know, retain more of my commission. Right.
[00:10:44] I mean, that's kind of the model. And a lot of brokerages are, are kind of built around that model and start getting recruited once you hit a certain threshold by those brokerages. Hey, keep 100% of your, your commissions. I get 58 of those emails a day. And I'm sure we have.
[00:10:59] We have what I work at one of those firms. And that's what I do all day is said, those kind of emails. So I, I appreciate that as well. Yeah.
[00:11:08] Yeah, it wasn't, it wasn't so much a voluntary thing. It was just, again, working with my father who had his own business. And I just, that's how I got into, into the game.
[00:11:17] So I didn't make that conscious decision. And I think back when I started in 0 4, there was teams, the team model wasn't as prevalent anyway. So I, it wasn't even something on my radar. I just figured, OK, you start with your sphere.
[00:11:31] And you build off that you've got friends, you've got family and you just generate all you can and I just kept hitting roadblocks that I think we all at some point have become accustomed to at this point.
[00:11:45] There's something to be said about working with family and friends. There's a certain divide of, I guess, trust and perception. I do not do they perceive you as a friend or a professional.
[00:12:03] I think that's, that is a major barrier and in the way you advise people and sometimes they're, they may feel there's some bias of that they may not actually take what you say as professional guidance and credible advice as opposed to just, you know, talking more casually and that, that was something that kind of hindered my progress.
[00:12:27] And then again, resourcefulness, I learned quickly that being able to be that all bases cover type of professional is really invaluable to retaining clients in the long term.
[00:12:44] That's something that I, you know, I struggled with, I mean, one person can only be in front of one place at one time on one call at one at any given moment.
[00:12:56] So I didn't, you know, I was getting stressed to have been essentially, and it was just tough to service my clients the way they deserve to be serviced and they, I could tell that they started to feel that I, they weren't my only clients.
[00:13:12] And that's what I try to, that's, that's where I wanted to evolve my practice into that type of feeling that, you know, the best analogy I can give is, everyone has two types of friends, the type of friend where you may lose touch for two years and when you reconnect, it's, it's like nothing, you know, time hasn't moved.
[00:13:36] And then there's other people that you feel like if you don't continually nurture and keep in contact with that friendship will kind of fade.
[00:13:45] And that's how I kind of look at my business model now. I want that type of connection with all the clients that I, that I meet and work with.
[00:13:54] And I want them to feel that type of bond and that I'm that resourceful to them. I want to become their go to for more than just one transaction, which may take only two to three months.
[00:14:09] You know, this is a lifelong relationship type of business and I stick with that philosophy wholeheartedly and what I did learn was working on your own.
[00:14:21] It's just, it's tough. It's tough to build that type strength of a bond because you just told in multiple directions you don't have any support.
[00:14:31] And people do get that sense of people are, you know, a lot smarter than you may think just because they may not be quite as educated in real estate.
[00:14:39] You know, they have that sense and they can kind of pick up on how much attention and how much focus you're able to give them at any given time.
[00:14:48] And if they need more attention and they need more guidance and you're not available to provide it, that's when you're at risk of losing them to someone who can give them the service that they need.
[00:15:02] Yeah, that's where it's where teams really shine these days is not just solving challenges for agents who maybe are struggling, but also, you know, struggling for new business or for whatever reason agents might consider joining a team.
[00:15:17] But really this idea you're right about your client as an individual practitioner without a team, your clients might start to notice, hey, boy Cyrus seems really busy and they're not necessarily going to say that to you because that takes a different level.
[00:15:34] So, you know, you know, you know, you're not going to be able to say that to your client and usually those clients aren't going to say that to your face, but they might be saying it to their partner who is, you know, is, you know, also helping with the transaction.
[00:15:43] And so you're right that sometimes agents don't even realize like you were saying sometimes the clients are smarter than we.
[00:15:51] Then the agents sort of give them credit for meaning, you know, they're thinking things that we don't know.
[00:15:57] So I think that's a really strong point is, you know, just because the client doesn't tell us, hey, it's been hard to get a hold of you.
[00:16:16] So, you know, just sort of like the load of having to wear every single hat, which is of course what individual agents, you know, depending on the firm they work out, hopefully the firm can help out with certain things.
[00:16:27] But ultimately, you know, a lot of individual agents are doing most everything on their own from all the document management to, you know, obviously all the marketing and the customer service.
[00:16:39] And then of course servicing the client while they're going through the transaction and all of those things can be well, it's just one person can't be good at all of that stuff, right?
[00:16:49] Right. Yeah, I mean, you need a support system and I think every individual broker will head to certain threshold where they start feeling less efficient and able to take on new business.
[00:17:04] You know, every broker is different, every person is different.
[00:17:08] You know, we all have our strengths and weaknesses and sometimes you do have to kind of make up for whatever weaknesses are with the supporting roles that other people can provide and the resources that people can provide.
[00:17:22] And again, I think as we evolve into the future, you know, your roles as an agent are expanding and changing and you know, we're not the same as people and the expectations of our roles are much different than they were 10 years ago.
[00:17:40] It's funny I was watching one of your previous podcasts and it wasn't part of directly part of the conversation, but you had referenced somebody who, you know, eight years ago said,
[00:17:52] made a comment and passing about how 10 years from now there won't be any real estate agents. There's no need for you guys.
[00:17:59] And I think you guys had a good laugh about how hey, we're still here. Thank goodness.
[00:18:05] But I mean, I always look for some type of truth than what whatever people are saying and, you know, to the point of, you know, the role of an agent and the definition of an agent 10 years ago, I think has changed.
[00:18:20] With respect to, you know, what type of value we can provide our clients and what the expectations are of how we how we are valuable to to the people who we represent and, you know, maybe 10 years ago, we were relied on to source properties and run comparables and give buyers and sellers, you know, comparative market analysis and opinions of value.
[00:18:49] Whereas, you know, we've really evolved into more of an advisory role today where the information is out there.
[00:18:56] We, you know, I don't think there's any client out there that's technologically savvy that needs us to source property for them.
[00:19:05] They've got Zillow.
[00:19:07] Yeah, I mean, I just anecdotally I working with buyers, I set up for automated searches for them just because it's I'm wired to do so.
[00:19:17] They're from out of town, they're come, they came in last weekend.
[00:19:20] They sent me an email.
[00:19:22] They haven't been really utilizing my automated searches. They sent me an email with 20 Zillow links to set. Here's the list.
[00:19:30] You know, we're scouting on our own, we don't need you for that.
[00:19:35] Whereas, you know, when I started my career, you know, clients did need me for that.
[00:19:39] I mean, they we were providing different types of information and, you know, now we're in a place where, you know, we have to be able to provide what today's clients need.
[00:19:50] And I think the group model is geared much more strongly towards that.
[00:19:58] With we need to give, you know, vendor referrals, we need resources at our disposal, we need, you know, they count on us for.
[00:20:06] For, you know, the trust element of being able to give them reliable inspectors, attorneys, contractors, you know, these are things that they have a more difficult time vetting.
[00:20:20] When you work with the group and you've got a track record, you've got high volume of sales, they know that you've done this repeatedly.
[00:20:29] I mean, I've worked with five or six different attorneys, you know, over the course of the year instead of just my one go to when I was a solo practitioner, I've worked with half a dozen to a dozen inspectors as opposed to my one go to, you know, you need to expand your resource base in order to really serve the client well so that you can kind of pair them with the other facets of the transaction that they rely on us for things like that.
[00:20:59] And I think even after, after the fact of these transactions, you want to build that off that level on layer of trust with them because that's kind of what I think creates the bot just having.
[00:21:12] Being there go to for every element of owning that real estate or or selling real estate in the future and, you know, I do think it's important that all the connections you can help them make are solid.
[00:21:26] Yeah, and that was one of the main reasons I I went to a group because I wanted their opinions and I wanted to be able to feed off that because, you know, the wrong referral can can also cost you the client.
[00:21:41] I mean, we're all kind of interconnected at this point and you know, that's kind of the all basis covered element of things where we all have to kind of support the client.
[00:21:52] And they need to develop trust with everybody they work with on all sides of the equation and if we can get them there, I think we retain them forever because they they can feel that.
[00:22:07] Hey, I can trust him and his advice and I know he's got the experience to guide me in the right directions whenever I need some help.
[00:22:17] I think I think that is such an important point and I want to go back to this vendor list sort of concept and I'm going to kind of hyper focus on it for just a minute or two because I think it's it's something that.
[00:22:27] REALTORS can really lean into especially now when you're right they don't need you to source properties they've got Redfin and Zillow and truly a million other public facing websites that have already done the heavy lifting about home searches, of course agents still need to be involved in that obviously, but you're right like the transaction itself.
[00:22:47] Might only be two or three months from start to finish home buying or selling and and then there becomes all of this other work that is kind of intangible or not directly related to sales that affects every single homeowner, which is I need to get stuff fixed or built or you know,
[00:23:07] adjusted or you know, I need a service professional to come out and look at whatever and it is I'm a homeowner and by the way, in our firm, we have 800 agents and we have a vendor list too, but we don't in our vendor list is just for our agents, but you know, we don't like how often we're updating it's probably not very often.
[00:23:24] So even when I need to get a service professional, I have to go to our like we have a Facebook group for our agents to be like i'm looking for a plumber and you know, I don't even know this stuff and so I think, you know agents could really become super valuable after or before a sale to the to the client or the lead or whatever when I call them the relationship, I guess, is best way to say it and to say hey before you ever need any before you start making phone calls and Google searching and looking for a moving company or whatever.
[00:23:55] I have got three great plumbers that I know are awesome and I've also got great painters and I've got great accountants and blah, blah, blah attorneys, etc.
[00:24:05] And you can become routinely valuable because there's always ongoing projects at every home, every home's got some project that's not completed yet or is about to be started or they're thinking about starting.
[00:24:19] So it really I hadn't really thought of it too much i've interviewed a ton of people on the show who do a big thing about vendor lists, but this idea that vendor vendors are always being needed by homeowners and so if you can really lean into that not you, of course, Cyrus you do this, but for anyone who's listening, you know, really make this your value add above and beyond helping them buy or sell a home, make this like this is actually how i'm really going to be able to provide value after the transaction be or even beforehand.
[00:24:47] I think that it really is is such a cool thing because you're providing incredible value because you're saving that person time and hopefully any mistakes by hiring the wrong person.
[00:25:00] Yeah, and I think even with the follow ups, you know, post transaction again, back to the point that our clients are probably smarter than we give them credit for, I think they can pretty easily tell the quality and.
[00:25:16] The direction of every touch you make and if if i'm reaching out with hey do you want to see a ma of your property, I think they can pretty quickly sense like i'm on fishing for business i'm looking out for myself and trying to make sure.
[00:25:32] I get my touches in as opposed to hey did you appeal your taxes last year yes that is an incredible incredible thing to suggest a.
[00:25:42] You're going to get a response every time when they sense that you're genuinely looking out for them and making sure that there's you know staying on top of their game and hey did you have you know house the house look.
[00:25:55] Do you need any repairs are you staying on top of sketch on on schedule with maintenance those types of things those types of touches they really.
[00:26:05] We sustain the bot and that's what i'm all about you know I know a lot of today's.
[00:26:12] You know model is geared towards I know it's the Zillow you know lifestyle at this point where you know people source and generate 90% of their business off something like that i'm kind of the opposite maybe i'm a dinosaur i'm a 90% direct referral guy and you know 10%.
[00:26:31] You know lead sourcing and whatnot so you know I do have to rely on.
[00:26:35] And sustaining the bond with with people after the fact and I think.
[00:26:43] You know if you start the relationship in that.
[00:26:48] Framework you can sustain it over the long term and those are the metrics that matter to me you know what hurts me the most is not whether I win a lead at the front end it's whether I buy someone into a property and I.
[00:27:03] If they list with someone else that to me is I mean I look I use it as a learning experience but it's a failure sure how did I fail this client how did I how did I lose the bond with with that that's that that's what I look at I don't look at conversion rates and all the metrics of the front end that you know a lot of the more.
[00:27:23] So I think it's a very successful top-priced agency only this is.
[00:27:28] You know what we're all numbers people at the end of the day I mean it's it's we like to quantify our success and you know it certainly has value and everybody needs to be able to set goals for themselves and you know the numbers be it production be it conversion.
[00:27:47] You know whatever it is on the front end it's valuable but I think what's invaluable is retention and I think that's something that it's easy it's easy to lose sight of because we can become hyper focused on generating and growing our business.
[00:28:02] But preserving the relationships that you built and you know how to go about doing that from day one is what's most important to me at least.
[00:28:13] I agree I I I was at this top producer breakfast yesterday and there was some somebody was sharing this anecdote I'm curious to get your thoughts on it the anecdote was top producer top one percenter was saying he was talking about a friend of his who's also a top one percenter different person and said this person this other person spends about 90 thousand dollars a year on leads.
[00:28:39] And the person who was speaking said he just blew his mind and he said boy I would take that same 90 thousand and invest it back into my sphere of influence and I was like okay well what does that mean he's like I would throw events I'd be buying gifts I'd be doing all sorts of fun things to help their life in in some way you know or whatever way he thinks might might add to their life maybe experiential stuff client events whatever or maybe little gift.
[00:29:08] And I think that's the best way to get a life here in there or just you know what whatever you know whatever that means to him and I thought why I've never heard anybody say that exact phrase before and it made and look we have had lead companies sponsor our show we love lead companies so if you are a lead company who's listening I'm I'm not anti lead there's a million ways to build this business.
[00:29:29] But I thought that's a really interesting idea is taking that money and that this particular agent who said I you know I wouldn't spend 90 thousand dollars on leads he wouldn't be good at that anyway this other person he's referencing is very good at that so everyone can do it differently but I thought that's so interesting you take that same money invested back into your sphere and you're going to have you know just people who love you for life because you're consistently adding value so just curious to get your thoughts on that.
[00:29:54] Yeah I think if you can somehow play the middle you take advantage of both you know that that again I mean I do feel like we're getting caught up in this new model of you know fighting for new business and generating and growth so everyone's front of mind is growth oriented is lead capture is how do I generate more opportunities and that is extremely important.
[00:30:23] Of course for you know the agent who got their license this morning to the top producer in the in the country but if you can find some balance it helps you not lose sight of the people who got you where you are today you know it's easy to you know pet yourself on the back but you know it takes clients that stick with you and it takes the money.
[00:30:53] So those people need they need to be appreciated they need to be remembered and they need to feel like this is this is a lifelong relationship that that has to be a high priority and I I would find a way to split it right down the middle.
[00:31:10] Sure yeah of course none of us are ever going to be content with where we're at we always want more and we want to grow and we want to improve and not just our skillset but our client base I mean that's what we do this for we're all motivated ambitious people otherwise we we wouldn't be in this field to begin with but it is important not don't lose sight of what got you to where you're at right now that's that's something I believe firmly in.
[00:31:40] And you know I'm always a little bit nervous to get too big or too successful I don't want that chip on my shoulder I don't want to feel like I you know put myself in a position to peak so to speak I mean that's that's something that I feel will cost me my edge yeah you know I it's it's even kind of where I position myself on this team I don't know if you want to transition into something like that but I I
[00:32:09] know I'm trying to create a model where I'm somewhere in the middle I like being an example I like being a role model to some newer agents but I also want to be able to look up to other people as well I want a mentor for the rest of my life I don't care if I'm the top producing agent in this country who I look up to right I mean I I always want to grow I always want to learn improve my skillset figure out new tricks of the trade
[00:32:39] I mean at the end of the day your your skill is the most important asset you have it's not just your ability to you know perfect some type of model it's how you how you serve your clients I mean that that will reflect on on your success more than anything else so you know by the same token don't forget the people that that got you where you're to where you're at and yeah I mean hey
[00:33:07] showing appreciation to them in any any way possible is always money well spent you do you do have to spend I mean that that's part of the game it's a business that money to make yeah and let's you're an you're an academic or at least I consider you to be more academically minded than myself so and I mean that it with the highest level of respect because you went through the two arguably two of the most difficult tracks law and and medicine
[00:33:37] and and you know and here you are and I don't get to talk to a lot of of REALTORS who who have that that background and so I would love to talk about the state of the market because it is a goofy time yesterday the fed raised rates I think it was the ninth straight time although it was a small a small increased 25 basis points I believe but
[00:34:01] banks are failing we've had three banks failed last week on this country there's a lot of goofiness going on around let of course lending rates are still you know higher of course then they were several years ago and inventory is still a challenge and in most of the major markets in this country and and then you have you know a good percentage of the population that refinance to about 3% or 4% in the last couple of years and that's also going to create you know stoppages around listings and you know I
[00:34:29] I worry about that for myself because I have one of those you know low low interest mortgages now and I'm like God what's my incentive to move like it's it's going to be tough so I am curious I think of myself more as a consumer then because I don't practice as an agent so I am just like I don't know what's going on out there right now really and I'm curious on sort of what you're seeing out there and maybe if you've made any pivots or adjustments this year to account for some of the
[00:34:59] goofiness in the market yeah I mean the conversations definitely shifting depending on who you're talking with I think it's a little bit of an easier conversation with buyers this year it's more of a balanced market is something I can more confidently tell them yes
[00:35:17] inventory is low but a lot of buyers are are spooked with the rates and you know the demand is not nearly as intense as it was so you're a go or two years ago when you could
[00:35:28] basically buy a house you know interest free almost to the point where you know a car note that's that type of rate so yeah and and again and I'm sure yeah everyone's had these conversations with their mortgage brokers and whatnot a get you data rate
[00:35:44] and it's it's I think it's become easier to discuss to keep it keep a buyer centered talk more about
[00:35:54] look rates are what they're going to do I'm it can impede you from progressing through your life and what you're you want to do and I mean if you want to become a homeowner you can't let an interest rate get in the way now it may
[00:36:09] adjust your your comfort level in terms of budget your spat yeah but hey I mean that that is what it is and you know the race could go up tomorrow and you'll be you'll have been glad you bought today
[00:36:22] and you know who pays a mortgage for 30 years at some point you're going to re-fi and you'll be watching for opportunities to to improve your payment and improve your rate I mean this is all cyclical a cyclical nature of real estate that everybody goes through over the course of their life
[00:36:40] but on the sell side yeah I mean I I feel you there it is a challenge it does make me nervous it is tough to overcome
[00:36:48] um that primary objection well I'm paying 2.5% now why would I ever want to sell this I've you know I've got equity as well so I mean we're not in that 2008 mode here where you know people are underwater over leverage that that's not happened here
[00:37:10] goodness people are in a comfortable position and they do feel like the market's still relatively in their favor because of the low inventory
[00:37:19] um but that's not to say that other factors may start coming into play um you know when we do have this level of uncertainty in the in the general macro market
[00:37:31] um you know other sectors get impacted and you know people can find themselves you know accumulating other revolving
[00:37:40] debt or there's a lot of job insecurity that's come into the fold now especially in tech brutal brutal quarter for tech
[00:37:49] this this year it's it's been I just talked to a tech recruiter yesterday and she's like she works at Oracle
[00:37:56] and she in Oracle's had all sorts of layoffs as well which I didn't realize but but yeah I mean there's
[00:38:02] tremendous job and security right now particularly a math sector yeah and what I tend to tell sellers is
[00:38:09] um you know they're there but there are there are leaks in this in this boat um it may not feel like it
[00:38:16] to you because we're talking real estate right now and you may have accumulated some equity you're paying
[00:38:21] a great rate but um if if part of your plan was to trade up from this condo to this single family home
[00:38:30] let's get it on the market don't let interest rates stand in the way because again there's a
[00:38:35] cyclical nature to that and you know there's no guarantee you will be paying 12% when you truly can't
[00:38:43] manage the space that you're living in and you're just but bursting at the seams and you don't want to
[00:38:49] wait for some of these leaks to get exposed and a higher number of sellers that feel you know
[00:38:58] and compelled to to to list their property or sell their property by force at that point the market
[00:39:04] starts turning against you and now you know you're in an over-supplied market trying to sell your
[00:39:09] property um you know just because you have leverage today and um you feel like you're in a good
[00:39:16] position now that this these these work in cycles um you know you don't need to time everything
[00:39:23] perfectly um and and it's it's almost always a trade right so whatever you feel like you may be
[00:39:29] losing on one end you get back on the other end and I try to keep people in that perspective but
[00:39:34] you're right a lot of it's tough to have conversations with people that that make any head headway
[00:39:41] because they're just they're they're they're married to this low interest comfortable position that
[00:39:48] they have had they have right now and unless they feel there's like there's a substantive reason to
[00:39:54] sell um you know they're they're pretty pretty closed about it close-minded about even considering
[00:40:02] that as an option so it's a tough time and yeah I mean obviously in this market we all want to be
[00:40:09] listing agents because it's just you know the side play um so yeah I mean it's it's yeah for the
[00:40:18] for the people that got into this business over the past two to three years uh you know this is
[00:40:23] a wake-up call and um you do have to kind of reconsider your your approach a little bit and
[00:40:30] and you know grind uh a little bit hard this is the year to grind absolutely yeah I mean you need
[00:40:38] to give yourself as many opportunities as possible and again I do think the balanced approach works
[00:40:43] um and that's I think the value of the group model is um you know more opportunities the better
[00:40:49] because they're it's it's not quite as uh abundant in terms of you know the way people are responding
[00:40:58] to to conversations nowadays a lot of people are just completely shut down about it and um
[00:41:05] you're kind of limited to people who are in a more pressing scenario where they are willing to
[00:41:11] forego um they're you know great scenario of two and a half percent and just deal with whatever
[00:41:19] interest rate they have to pay because they have to yeah yeah there there there's always going to be
[00:41:25] that market but it's it's a it's a thinner thinner pull I think there's it's a thinner pull of
[00:41:31] of clients for sure because of the I think rates or you said primary objection there and I also
[00:41:38] think it's an opportunity for agents like yourself and and our listeners to really consider to
[00:41:45] realize a couple of things that when the market thins which it is right now to some degree um although
[00:41:51] it is improving we've we've been seeing increased activity I so I'm excited uh for that um but for
[00:41:58] everyone seems to be struggling a little bit right now agent wise um but I think it's it's a good
[00:42:03] opportunity to pick up market share because I will tell you um we have another company which is a
[00:42:09] holding company for agents that aren't actively practicing and uh we started this company just to
[00:42:14] give you guys an idea of of just how how crazy this is so we this is for people who don't practice
[00:42:20] real estate but want to keep their license active okay so I'm just that's what a holding company is
[00:42:23] I don't know if every state allows it but it Illinois we allow that so we started this about eight
[00:42:27] I don't know eight or nine years ago because people would leave our company and leave the industry
[00:42:31] and we were like oh what are you doing with your license oh I'm taking to a holding company well
[00:42:35] we learned what a holding company was and then we were like oh we can we can do that anyway the
[00:42:39] reason I'm bringing this up in the last so we do almost no marketing for this we just like send
[00:42:45] out emails to agents going if you're not practicing you know do that's literally all we've
[00:42:50] done for this holding company um in the last uh since the beginning of the year we have added 120
[00:42:59] new agents to the holding company which now puts our holding company at about 900 agents
[00:43:05] which is actually bigger than our actively producing company which has 800 agents so we are seeing
[00:43:11] a mass exodus of of REALTORS uh leaving the industry now the top agents aren't leaving of course
[00:43:17] but we're we're seeing smaller producers the ones e2z the half you know the the part-time agents
[00:43:23] starting to fall away enjoying firms like like our holding company which is great for our holding
[00:43:28] company um but it's really a telling sign for the for the industry that here in Chicago we've got
[00:43:33] about 46,000 REALTORS and um you know uh we're I think we think we're the largest holding company now
[00:43:39] but we're not the only one and the other ones must be flourishing as well and so that being said
[00:43:43] it's a great time to pick up market share and I think it's a great time for REALTORS like yourself
[00:43:48] as Iris you obviously are doing this you just answered the question about you know what do you do
[00:43:54] in a low interest rate environment what do you say to people who who have our stock in these rates
[00:43:58] and are feeling like kind of almost hamstrung like I I maybe I'd like to move but you know I don't
[00:44:05] want to double my rate and and having those conversations I think is really important in an agent
[00:44:11] can do that now because people are thinking about it right people are thinking especially if you
[00:44:15] bought your home two years ago right you're you're probably now at that point where you're settled to
[00:44:20] your home and now you're starting to think about what's next maybe you're you're in your forever
[00:44:23] home and it doesn't matter you're you're good but most of us you know aren't in our forever
[00:44:28] home so this idea of like now it's maybe a couple years in especially if you bought during that time
[00:44:33] or refinance at that time now it's like okay what's next and you're not sure and guidance and help
[00:44:39] and education is so critical and it's just I don't want to have to I don't want to really have to
[00:44:45] go to a news source to learn about what interest rates are doing and and what the market is doing
[00:44:53] like I really just want my or rather I'll give a different example what when I go to do my taxes
[00:44:57] every year I don't really want my account and just going send me receipts and you know I'll do
[00:45:03] the taxes because she does that anyway I want her to be like hey I have an idea for you like that's
[00:45:07] what I always want like oh here's a way to save more money or here's a deduction you didn't know
[00:45:11] about now does she always do that no but I I would probably pay her more if she if she said well
[00:45:18] I'm gonna add on some additional fees but this year this next year I'm gonna give you all these
[00:45:22] other ideas I would absolutely pay that because I think we're all looking for guidance and help
[00:45:28] especially around this and this is where I think the value of the REALTOR really comes in is if
[00:45:32] you can say here's why you still may want to consider going from a 3% rate to a 6.5% rate or whatever
[00:45:39] it might be today and you might say that might sound crazy but hear me out I actually have some
[00:45:44] logic here about why that could actually make sense right like that's a really compelling narrative
[00:45:50] and I think you know and it doesn't have to be a perfectly told story with like it's a slam dunk
[00:45:55] to obviously you know trash your good mortgage for for for a one that's a little bit tougher but
[00:46:00] people are thinking about that stuff anyway so I think now is the time to engage in those
[00:46:04] conversations curious to get your thoughts on that yeah I agree and to your point that you know
[00:46:12] some of the part the part time crowd is sort of thinning out I think a lot of people who
[00:46:19] you came accustomed to kind of starting on step two with clients like you they're already kind
[00:46:24] of committed to making the move you know those are the that's the low hanging fruit for those who
[00:46:32] stuck around because a lot of those agents are either just dropping out of the industry literally
[00:46:40] or figuratively they're disengaging with a lot of these prospects because
[00:46:46] um they're not not adept at having that initial conversation because they never had to before
[00:46:53] um so I think it is a time where um the you know the market is looking for knowledge and insight
[00:47:04] and guidance but more than anything else just some someone to just bounce ideas off of or someone to
[00:47:15] just be actively in communication with so I think you can find yourself cultivating a lot of
[00:47:21] relationships now that were tougher to to source um to a couple of years ago um you know
[00:47:29] anyone's you know uncle could have sold a house two years ago and you know how where was the
[00:47:35] value of being in a group or a top producer or having a track record at that point it didn't
[00:47:40] matter when the house was selling itself and you know everyone wanted to buy and sell but
[00:47:45] when we're in a little tougher market to navigate that's where um the value really comes into play
[00:47:51] and your experience and being able to talk you whether you know in today's market or reference
[00:47:59] you know again a previous cycle or or something to that effect where you can you can really inform
[00:48:05] um people about the general nature of real estate and how it does cycle through and
[00:48:14] and give them a little bit of a broader perspective of of how the market works and and kind of
[00:48:20] reassure them that you know it's there's never a perfect time um it's it's about your life and
[00:48:27] you know you can make adjustments um in the in any moment at any given time um so you don't have to
[00:48:35] sit on a fence and i think a lot of people are just kind of hanging out on this fence and they're
[00:48:39] not getting any good advice from from the people they start to talking with initially because
[00:48:45] they haven't been through this um and they they don't have enough experience um to really guide them
[00:48:51] through you know there there isn't a reference point for for some of these agents to be able to
[00:48:58] say look i mean you know i went through this uh back in 2010 with somebody or 2015 and
[00:49:05] at the end of the day you just you know you make the most of the of the current situation and you
[00:49:10] don't let that deter you from what you're trying to do with your with your life and with your timing
[00:49:16] um you know a lot of people are um you know kind of stalling on other elements of their life maybe they
[00:49:22] they don't feel like they want to sell their condo and buy a house and is it can they start a family
[00:49:28] um are they postponing getting married i mean everything kind of you know ties into
[00:49:35] each other um in terms of um people's you know natural progression through life so i do think it's
[00:49:41] valuable we become more valuable um by just being someone that that can even listen
[00:49:48] yeah more than anything else yeah you're you're you're so right um i i have just one this idea of
[00:49:56] listening is is important because i think especially when it's outside of the sale right so like
[00:50:03] outside of the sales transaction cycle you know how can you still be a listener a year after the
[00:50:09] home was sold or bought right and and and that's really a really important skill because if your
[00:50:16] client if your client knows every year or however often you know you might reach out to people that
[00:50:22] you've previously worked with um if every year they know oh my my guy checks in on me or or my
[00:50:29] my woman or or whoever right my agent checks in on me and and make sure that everything's okay
[00:50:34] make sure that i'm doing okay you know and then if if i want an updated sort of here's what my home
[00:50:41] is worth i can go to my agent they can figure that out for me if i need a plumber if i need to know
[00:50:45] what's going on with this fed rate increase i can call my agent you know agent being the consultant
[00:50:51] or the the answer person versus just the person that says this is the home that you want right
[00:50:58] because we know that people can make that decision mostly by themselves although obviously you know
[00:51:02] agents are critical for that as well but um i have one just one question for you and i always love
[00:51:07] i i just started wanting to do this uh in in more recent episodes because we want to humanize all
[00:51:12] of you know you're you're a top producer you're you're a superstar you work on a superstar team um
[00:51:18] what's a mistake that you've made with a client or in your business that you wish you hadn't or
[00:51:25] or a mistake that that you know something that you can share so that we can bring you down to
[00:51:30] our reality of imperfection but tell us tell us something that you did that uh that um you know
[00:51:37] that was a mistake oh man i mean where do i even begin i uh everything i've done well
[00:51:47] has been the result of about a dozen things i've done poorly so yeah um i think
[00:51:56] just trying to be someone i'm not or trying to be an expert in something i'm not um that's kind
[00:52:02] of come back to to bite me quite quite a handful of times um you know the ego can get in the way and
[00:52:10] i've been asked to to list or advise on properties um that i just don't have the first clue about
[00:52:18] and i need to educate myself um prior but i take it on because um i want to i mean i
[00:52:24] um i i sold about 20 parcels of land last year um in moneal and oi and you know until the client called
[00:52:32] me and and told me about them i didn't know where that was on the map i i've never heard of that
[00:52:38] yeah that's how that's how far away it must be it's pretty far away and um you know i
[00:52:45] it took me about two and a half years to sell it because it took me about a year and a half to
[00:52:49] figure out what i was selling um in the process so i did kind of make an ass out of myself on that
[00:52:54] fortunately some of the parcels were um you know ten thousand dollars a piece and the client was
[00:52:59] very patient with me but um yeah i mean getting calls from hog farmers about um you know cattle capacity
[00:53:07] or poll barns and whatnot um you know i i would say you know my biggest mistakes are not
[00:53:15] not teaching myself or not looking for guidance on something that i am not experienced with
[00:53:23] before committing yeah to to trying to sell them or or we're going to represent someone on a purchase it's
[00:53:31] you know you can you can get yourself into a little bit of soup there um but
[00:53:38] yeah i've done it a handful of times sometimes it's it's how i end up learning about what i'm
[00:53:43] lacking in terms of knowledge but um better instead of learning before the client
[00:53:50] and yeah in hindsight i would probably want to work with someone experienced first before i
[00:53:57] jump in the pool with with the client so i you know back to the serve your clients well principle
[00:54:05] you know learning on the fly isn't always the best move and i made an ass out of myself several times
[00:54:11] just uh you know kind of picking it up as i go well it's okay we're all human we all screw up all the time
[00:54:18] right so it's just uh it's a matter of learning and moving on and i appreciate you uh sharing
[00:54:23] being vulnerable and sharing that um it's it's a good lesson too it's like hey if you get this
[00:54:28] commercial opportunity and you're like i don't know about this i don't know what this is i don't
[00:54:32] know i don't even know what this sector means uh yeah maybe pass it over to someone else not you
[00:54:37] i'm saying i'm saying in general if if you find yourself in this situation um save yourself a
[00:54:41] lot of headache and uh find someone else to refer it to and then you can learn alongside them uh
[00:54:48] and still earn a part of the commission but i get it it's it's we all want to say yes to everything
[00:54:52] of course we do everybody does um it's like when somebody comes in and goes you know wants to
[00:54:57] interview with us we have eight about 800 agents and they go would you guys accept me i'm like oh
[00:55:02] we'll accept you um it's more of a matter of whether we'll meet your needs uh because we want to say
[00:55:07] yes to everyone too right and that's got not sort of trouble as well we've had we brought on agents
[00:55:11] we're like uh what were we thinking that was dumb so so i i get it even even brokerages make these
[00:55:17] kind of errors it's all just part of part of growing and um sorry i really appreciate uh your time
[00:55:23] and and i really just love how how steady you are in your business and how how sort of just
[00:55:28] you know you're not like a glitzing lamb flash guy which i love because those those types of
[00:55:34] people tend to get the most publicity of the most press um but it can be tough um those conversations
[00:55:41] i've had with people like that can be difficult because it's harder to get into the meat of like
[00:55:46] what they actually do because there's so much of an image component associated with that and i
[00:55:50] love the fact that you're like i'm just me um obviously you're a very educated person which i think

And now, onto our show. Hello and welcome to another episode of Keeping It Real, the largest podcast made by Real Estate agents and for Real Estate agents. My name is DJ Paris. I am your guide and host through the show. And in just a moment, we're going to be speaking with top producer Cyrus Surrage. But before we get to Cyrus, just I actually got a quick announcement for you. Well, before the announcement, I want to say thank you, of course, to everyone listening. Thank you for supporting the podcast, support our sponsors. Please tell a friend, like and subscribe. Okay, here's the announcement. This is kind of embarrassing to admit. I've had a million different social media experts on the show over the years to tell agents exactly how they should be ramping up their social activity and engagement. And I myself have not done it as well. So if you're out there listening to some of our episodes and going, gosh, I need to take some of that and put it into practice. Yeah, I do this. I need to do the same. So finally, after five or six years of the show, we are going to start clipping our episodes and putting those on social media. So what that means is, you know, each of our episodes is usually like 45 minutes to an hour long. And obviously not everybody listens to every minute of that hour. And as much as we would love it if they did, of course, people are busy. So what we're going to do is we have, I've now hired somebody to start going through the episodes. Yes, we are going to continue to release full episodes. And that's where the majority of you are going to listen. But we wanted to give you some of the highlights of those. So we're going to find the best segments or the best moments of the show, usually 30 to 60 second clips. And we're going to be pushing those out on all the social platforms, including TikTok, Instagram, YouTube, LinkedIn. I think I just said LinkedIn twice, Facebook, of course, as well. So anyway, everywhere we're going to start pushing out these short form clips. Stay tuned. We'll be doing an official launch for that shortly. And we'd love your support there. So hopefully that'll help you kind of remember these like important little tips and tricks distilled down to 30 and 60 second clips. So again, we'll be promoting that shortly once we officially launch it. And I'll be talking a lot about our social channels to help get you guys subscribed to that so that you can get daily doses of some of this information. And we have about 500 episodes to go back through and clip out. So we got a lot of content. So anyway, this was a long intro. I appreciate you listening to stay tuned. Some really exciting things happening on the show. And let's get to it. A main event I've kept you long enough. My conversation with Cyrus Sirosh. Today on the show we have Cyrus Sirosh with M.G. Group Chicago with Berkshire Halfaway Home Services. Let me tell you more about Cyrus. Now, Cyrus joined the M.G. Group. By the way, if you're a local Chicago person, that's the Mario Greco Group. You might know it by that name. But he joined the Mario Greco Group in 2016. He was born and raised in Chicago and Northwest suburbs and spent most of his childhood alongside his father rehabbing apartment buildings and single family homes. Cyrus graduated with a Bachelor of Science from Loyola University and later attained a JD from Loyola's School of Law with a focus in real estate. Since 2004, Cyrus is focused on commercial and residential sales, leasing and management alongside 10 years of experience as a loan originator and processor and brings an all-basis covered approach to his clients to ensure the highest quality of representation. Cyrus, welcome to the show. Glad to have you. Great to be here. Great to have you. So you went from rehabbing homes with your father to then going and getting your law degree and back into real estate, sort of doing mortgages and then kind of see, you've been involved in the real estate industry ever since you were little. Ever since I was mowing the lawn for my dad at 12 in front of the apartment buildings, yes. Sure. Well, tell us how you got how you decided to. So when you went to law school, was that was the thought were you were real, wanted to be a real estate attorney or were you wanting to go a different direction with law? Well, tell you the truth, I was actually pre-med in undergrad. I wanted to be a doctor by the time I got to my senior year and actually started volunteering in the hospitals and got employed as an EMT and was out in the field. I realized I don't have the stomach for this. I've come to respect physicians and what they do. It just wasn't the right fit for me and then I went into finance with my father. He's a self-made man. So he started so mortgage brokerage. So straight out of college, even during college, I was helping him out. I'm a kind of a numbers guy. I love math. That's where my skills are strongest. So I was enjoying doing finance with him for several years. Back then, you didn't need an originator's license and it was kind of the Wild West if you recall. So of course, I got into brokering real estate transactions at the same time. The glory days, finance the deal, broker the deal. Get some experience on that front as well. Actually, it didn't go to law school until the market crashed. In08, I had a couple zero quarters and realized I might need another career. That's when I got into that. And fortunately, I, you know, with my passion for real estate, by the time I finished school, the market had rebounded a bit and I was able to kind of get some traction again and decided, OK. I didn't necessarily want to become an attorney. So I was happy to get back into the real estate field just with another kind of tool in the tool belt, another skill. I do feel there's a lot of value and having experience in all the facets of a real estate transaction. So that was just one more kind of check on the box of what I could help advise on not taking the role of an attorney, not taking the role of a loan officer, but at least being a soundboard for my clients if they do want a second opinion or want to bounce ideas off me. Is this, does this at least sound right to you or trusting in my referrals a little bit more knowing that I have that background and some experience in those fields. Yeah, it's amazing. You really, it's incredible that it's incredible to go just back to college for a second because I did the pre-med thing for a one semester. And then I was like, oh, this is really, really a difficult track. And thankfully got out before I got into like organic and organic chemistry and you made it all the way through those and then we're like, I also, I really want to chat with you because you have a kind of an interesting trajectory. I think we were talking about this. Well, we actually didn't talk about this ahead of time, but you'd sent this over and some information that we requested. And I thought this was particularly interesting because, you know, this idea of the one of the big questions that our audience is always asking when they write this in all the time to us, which is, you know, hey, I'm an individual practitioner. And I'm thinking about either starting a team or joining a team. And of course, you know, there's, depending on, you know, what what their goals are and how long they've been in the business and where they're struggling and all of those things would sort of help somebody make a better decision around that, but you've done both. And you've done it in a way that's, I think kind of unique. So I'm really interested in digging into that a little bit. So if I understand correctly, the first 11 years of your career, you were solo practitioner. And then in the last eight years, you joined the Mario Greco team, which again, Mario Greco group, I should say, rather, which is, by the way, here in Chicago, one of the pre-eminent groups highly respected, great people. They've got an amazing team. They're one of the big boys here in Chicago. So I'm excited to learn what it was like on your own. And obviously you were successful there. And then making figuring out that, oh, I think I do want to be involved with with a larger group. And I'm just curious on any advice you might have to people who are thinking about that. But let's start at the beginning. So you started out as an individual, you know, independent agent. And then tell us how that process went, you know, like as you were growing. And then what, at what point did you sort of say, I think it's time that I get some additional resources and support and think about joining a team. Sure. Yeah, started in a kind of went in the reverse direction that most people go, I think. Yeah, it's going to say. Yeah. This day and age, they, they join a team because they feel it's, it's necessary. They want the accelerated learning curve. They need to build a book and the opportunities that a team leader can provide. And then, you know, mentality being, I hit a certain threshold that I can go out on my own and, you know, retain more of my commission. Right. I mean, that's kind of the model. And a lot of brokerages are, are kind of built around that model and start getting recruited once you hit a certain threshold by those brokerages. Hey, keep 100% of your, your commissions. I get 58 of those emails a day. And I'm sure we have. We have what I work at one of those firms. And that's what I do all day is said, those kind of emails. So I, I appreciate that as well. Yeah. Yeah, it wasn't, it wasn't so much a voluntary thing. It was just, again, working with my father who had his own business. And I just, that's how I got into, into the game. So I didn't make that conscious decision. And I think back when I started in 0 4, there was teams, the team model wasn't as prevalent anyway. So I, it wasn't even something on my radar. I just figured, OK, you start with your sphere. And you build off that you've got friends, you've got family and you just generate all you can and I just kept hitting roadblocks that I think we all at some point have become accustomed to at this point. There's something to be said about working with family and friends. There's a certain divide of, I guess, trust and perception. I do not do they perceive you as a friend or a professional. I think that's, that is a major barrier and in the way you advise people and sometimes they're, they may feel there's some bias of that they may not actually take what you say as professional guidance and credible advice as opposed to just, you know, talking more casually and that, that was something that kind of hindered my progress. And then again, resourcefulness, I learned quickly that being able to be that all bases cover type of professional is really invaluable to retaining clients in the long term. That's something that I, you know, I struggled with, I mean, one person can only be in front of one place at one time on one call at one at any given moment. So I didn't, you know, I was getting stressed to have been essentially, and it was just tough to service my clients the way they deserve to be serviced and they, I could tell that they started to feel that I, they weren't my only clients. And that's what I try to, that's, that's where I wanted to evolve my practice into that type of feeling that, you know, the best analogy I can give is, everyone has two types of friends, the type of friend where you may lose touch for two years and when you reconnect, it's, it's like nothing, you know, time hasn't moved. And then there's other people that you feel like if you don't continually nurture and keep in contact with that friendship will kind of fade. And that's how I kind of look at my business model now. I want that type of connection with all the clients that I, that I meet and work with. And I want them to feel that type of bond and that I'm that resourceful to them. I want to become their go to for more than just one transaction, which may take only two to three months. You know, this is a lifelong relationship type of business and I stick with that philosophy wholeheartedly and what I did learn was working on your own. It's just, it's tough. It's tough to build that type strength of a bond because you just told in multiple directions you don't have any support. And people do get that sense of people are, you know, a lot smarter than you may think just because they may not be quite as educated in real estate. You know, they have that sense and they can kind of pick up on how much attention and how much focus you're able to give them at any given time. And if they need more attention and they need more guidance and you're not available to provide it, that's when you're at risk of losing them to someone who can give them the service that they need. Yeah, that's where it's where teams really shine these days is not just solving challenges for agents who maybe are struggling, but also, you know, struggling for new business or for whatever reason agents might consider joining a team. But really this idea you're right about your client as an individual practitioner without a team, your clients might start to notice, hey, boy Cyrus seems really busy and they're not necessarily going to say that to you because that takes a different level. So, you know, you know, you know, you're not going to be able to say that to your client and usually those clients aren't going to say that to your face, but they might be saying it to their partner who is, you know, is, you know, also helping with the transaction. And so you're right that sometimes agents don't even realize like you were saying sometimes the clients are smarter than we. Then the agents sort of give them credit for meaning, you know, they're thinking things that we don't know. So I think that's a really strong point is, you know, just because the client doesn't tell us, hey, it's been hard to get a hold of you. So, you know, just sort of like the load of having to wear every single hat, which is of course what individual agents, you know, depending on the firm they work out, hopefully the firm can help out with certain things. But ultimately, you know, a lot of individual agents are doing most everything on their own from all the document management to, you know, obviously all the marketing and the customer service. And then of course servicing the client while they're going through the transaction and all of those things can be well, it's just one person can't be good at all of that stuff, right? Right. Yeah, I mean, you need a support system and I think every individual broker will head to certain threshold where they start feeling less efficient and able to take on new business. You know, every broker is different, every person is different. You know, we all have our strengths and weaknesses and sometimes you do have to kind of make up for whatever weaknesses are with the supporting roles that other people can provide and the resources that people can provide. And again, I think as we evolve into the future, you know, your roles as an agent are expanding and changing and you know, we're not the same as people and the expectations of our roles are much different than they were 10 years ago. It's funny I was watching one of your previous podcasts and it wasn't part of directly part of the conversation, but you had referenced somebody who, you know, eight years ago said, made a comment and passing about how 10 years from now there won't be any real estate agents. There's no need for you guys. And I think you guys had a good laugh about how hey, we're still here. Thank goodness. But I mean, I always look for some type of truth than what whatever people are saying and, you know, to the point of, you know, the role of an agent and the definition of an agent 10 years ago, I think has changed. With respect to, you know, what type of value we can provide our clients and what the expectations are of how we how we are valuable to to the people who we represent and, you know, maybe 10 years ago, we were relied on to source properties and run comparables and give buyers and sellers, you know, comparative market analysis and opinions of value. Whereas, you know, we've really evolved into more of an advisory role today where the information is out there. We, you know, I don't think there's any client out there that's technologically savvy that needs us to source property for them. They've got Zillow. Yeah, I mean, I just anecdotally I working with buyers, I set up for automated searches for them just because it's I'm wired to do so. They're from out of town, they're come, they came in last weekend. They sent me an email. They haven't been really utilizing my automated searches. They sent me an email with 20 Zillow links to set. Here's the list. You know, we're scouting on our own, we don't need you for that. Whereas, you know, when I started my career, you know, clients did need me for that. I mean, they we were providing different types of information and, you know, now we're in a place where, you know, we have to be able to provide what today's clients need. And I think the group model is geared much more strongly towards that. With we need to give, you know, vendor referrals, we need resources at our disposal, we need, you know, they count on us for. For, you know, the trust element of being able to give them reliable inspectors, attorneys, contractors, you know, these are things that they have a more difficult time vetting. When you work with the group and you've got a track record, you've got high volume of sales, they know that you've done this repeatedly. I mean, I've worked with five or six different attorneys, you know, over the course of the year instead of just my one go to when I was a solo practitioner, I've worked with half a dozen to a dozen inspectors as opposed to my one go to, you know, you need to expand your resource base in order to really serve the client well so that you can kind of pair them with the other facets of the transaction that they rely on us for things like that. And I think even after, after the fact of these transactions, you want to build that off that level on layer of trust with them because that's kind of what I think creates the bot just having. Being there go to for every element of owning that real estate or or selling real estate in the future and, you know, I do think it's important that all the connections you can help them make are solid. Yeah, and that was one of the main reasons I I went to a group because I wanted their opinions and I wanted to be able to feed off that because, you know, the wrong referral can can also cost you the client. I mean, we're all kind of interconnected at this point and you know, that's kind of the all basis covered element of things where we all have to kind of support the client. And they need to develop trust with everybody they work with on all sides of the equation and if we can get them there, I think we retain them forever because they they can feel that. Hey, I can trust him and his advice and I know he's got the experience to guide me in the right directions whenever I need some help. I think I think that is such an important point and I want to go back to this vendor list sort of concept and I'm going to kind of hyper focus on it for just a minute or two because I think it's it's something that. REALTORS can really lean into especially now when you're right they don't need you to source properties they've got Redfin and Zillow and truly a million other public facing websites that have already done the heavy lifting about home searches, of course agents still need to be involved in that obviously, but you're right like the transaction itself. Might only be two or three months from start to finish home buying or selling and and then there becomes all of this other work that is kind of intangible or not directly related to sales that affects every single homeowner, which is I need to get stuff fixed or built or you know, adjusted or you know, I need a service professional to come out and look at whatever and it is I'm a homeowner and by the way, in our firm, we have 800 agents and we have a vendor list too, but we don't in our vendor list is just for our agents, but you know, we don't like how often we're updating it's probably not very often. So even when I need to get a service professional, I have to go to our like we have a Facebook group for our agents to be like i'm looking for a plumber and you know, I don't even know this stuff and so I think, you know agents could really become super valuable after or before a sale to the to the client or the lead or whatever when I call them the relationship, I guess, is best way to say it and to say hey before you ever need any before you start making phone calls and Google searching and looking for a moving company or whatever. I have got three great plumbers that I know are awesome and I've also got great painters and I've got great accountants and blah, blah, blah attorneys, etc. And you can become routinely valuable because there's always ongoing projects at every home, every home's got some project that's not completed yet or is about to be started or they're thinking about starting. So it really I hadn't really thought of it too much i've interviewed a ton of people on the show who do a big thing about vendor lists, but this idea that vendor vendors are always being needed by homeowners and so if you can really lean into that not you, of course, Cyrus you do this, but for anyone who's listening, you know, really make this your value add above and beyond helping them buy or sell a home, make this like this is actually how i'm really going to be able to provide value after the transaction be or even beforehand. I think that it really is is such a cool thing because you're providing incredible value because you're saving that person time and hopefully any mistakes by hiring the wrong person. Yeah, and I think even with the follow ups, you know, post transaction again, back to the point that our clients are probably smarter than we give them credit for, I think they can pretty easily tell the quality and. The direction of every touch you make and if if i'm reaching out with hey do you want to see a ma of your property, I think they can pretty quickly sense like i'm on fishing for business i'm looking out for myself and trying to make sure. I get my touches in as opposed to hey did you appeal your taxes last year yes that is an incredible incredible thing to suggest a. You're going to get a response every time when they sense that you're genuinely looking out for them and making sure that there's you know staying on top of their game and hey did you have you know house the house look. Do you need any repairs are you staying on top of sketch on on schedule with maintenance those types of things those types of touches they really. We sustain the bot and that's what i'm all about you know I know a lot of today's. You know model is geared towards I know it's the Zillow you know lifestyle at this point where you know people source and generate 90% of their business off something like that i'm kind of the opposite maybe i'm a dinosaur i'm a 90% direct referral guy and you know 10%. You know lead sourcing and whatnot so you know I do have to rely on. And sustaining the bond with with people after the fact and I think. You know if you start the relationship in that. Framework you can sustain it over the long term and those are the metrics that matter to me you know what hurts me the most is not whether I win a lead at the front end it's whether I buy someone into a property and I. If they list with someone else that to me is I mean I look I use it as a learning experience but it's a failure sure how did I fail this client how did I how did I lose the bond with with that that's that that's what I look at I don't look at conversion rates and all the metrics of the front end that you know a lot of the more. So I think it's a very successful top-priced agency only this is. You know what we're all numbers people at the end of the day I mean it's it's we like to quantify our success and you know it certainly has value and everybody needs to be able to set goals for themselves and you know the numbers be it production be it conversion. You know whatever it is on the front end it's valuable but I think what's invaluable is retention and I think that's something that it's easy it's easy to lose sight of because we can become hyper focused on generating and growing our business. But preserving the relationships that you built and you know how to go about doing that from day one is what's most important to me at least. I agree I I I was at this top producer breakfast yesterday and there was some somebody was sharing this anecdote I'm curious to get your thoughts on it the anecdote was top producer top one percenter was saying he was talking about a friend of his who's also a top one percenter different person and said this person this other person spends about 90 thousand dollars a year on leads. And the person who was speaking said he just blew his mind and he said boy I would take that same 90 thousand and invest it back into my sphere of influence and I was like okay well what does that mean he's like I would throw events I'd be buying gifts I'd be doing all sorts of fun things to help their life in in some way you know or whatever way he thinks might might add to their life maybe experiential stuff client events whatever or maybe little gift. And I think that's the best way to get a life here in there or just you know what whatever you know whatever that means to him and I thought why I've never heard anybody say that exact phrase before and it made and look we have had lead companies sponsor our show we love lead companies so if you are a lead company who's listening I'm I'm not anti lead there's a million ways to build this business. But I thought that's a really interesting idea is taking that money and that this particular agent who said I you know I wouldn't spend 90 thousand dollars on leads he wouldn't be good at that anyway this other person he's referencing is very good at that so everyone can do it differently but I thought that's so interesting you take that same money invested back into your sphere and you're going to have you know just people who love you for life because you're consistently adding value so just curious to get your thoughts on that. Yeah I think if you can somehow play the middle you take advantage of both you know that that again I mean I do feel like we're getting caught up in this new model of you know fighting for new business and generating and growth so everyone's front of mind is growth oriented is lead capture is how do I generate more opportunities and that is extremely important. Of course for you know the agent who got their license this morning to the top producer in the in the country but if you can find some balance it helps you not lose sight of the people who got you where you are today you know it's easy to you know pet yourself on the back but you know it takes clients that stick with you and it takes the money. So those people need they need to be appreciated they need to be remembered and they need to feel like this is this is a lifelong relationship that that has to be a high priority and I I would find a way to split it right down the middle. Sure yeah of course none of us are ever going to be content with where we're at we always want more and we want to grow and we want to improve and not just our skillset but our client base I mean that's what we do this for we're all motivated ambitious people otherwise we we wouldn't be in this field to begin with but it is important not don't lose sight of what got you to where you're at right now that's that's something I believe firmly in. And you know I'm always a little bit nervous to get too big or too successful I don't want that chip on my shoulder I don't want to feel like I you know put myself in a position to peak so to speak I mean that's that's something that I feel will cost me my edge yeah you know I it's it's even kind of where I position myself on this team I don't know if you want to transition into something like that but I I know I'm trying to create a model where I'm somewhere in the middle I like being an example I like being a role model to some newer agents but I also want to be able to look up to other people as well I want a mentor for the rest of my life I don't care if I'm the top producing agent in this country who I look up to right I mean I I always want to grow I always want to learn improve my skillset figure out new tricks of the trade I mean at the end of the day your your skill is the most important asset you have it's not just your ability to you know perfect some type of model it's how you how you serve your clients I mean that that will reflect on on your success more than anything else so you know by the same token don't forget the people that that got you where you're to where you're at and yeah I mean hey showing appreciation to them in any any way possible is always money well spent you do you do have to spend I mean that that's part of the game it's a business that money to make yeah and let's you're an you're an academic or at least I consider you to be more academically minded than myself so and I mean that it with the highest level of respect because you went through the two arguably two of the most difficult tracks law and and medicine and and you know and here you are and I don't get to talk to a lot of of REALTORS who who have that that background and so I would love to talk about the state of the market because it is a goofy time yesterday the fed raised rates I think it was the ninth straight time although it was a small a small increased 25 basis points I believe but banks are failing we've had three banks failed last week on this country there's a lot of goofiness going on around let of course lending rates are still you know higher of course then they were several years ago and inventory is still a challenge and in most of the major markets in this country and and then you have you know a good percentage of the population that refinance to about 3% or 4% in the last couple of years and that's also going to create you know stoppages around listings and you know I I worry about that for myself because I have one of those you know low low interest mortgages now and I'm like God what's my incentive to move like it's it's going to be tough so I am curious I think of myself more as a consumer then because I don't practice as an agent so I am just like I don't know what's going on out there right now really and I'm curious on sort of what you're seeing out there and maybe if you've made any pivots or adjustments this year to account for some of the goofiness in the market yeah I mean the conversations definitely shifting depending on who you're talking with I think it's a little bit of an easier conversation with buyers this year it's more of a balanced market is something I can more confidently tell them yes inventory is low but a lot of buyers are are spooked with the rates and you know the demand is not nearly as intense as it was so you're a go or two years ago when you could basically buy a house you know interest free almost to the point where you know a car note that's that type of rate so yeah and and again and I'm sure yeah everyone's had these conversations with their mortgage brokers and whatnot a get you data rate and it's it's I think it's become easier to discuss to keep it keep a buyer centered talk more about look rates are what they're going to do I'm it can impede you from progressing through your life and what you're you want to do and I mean if you want to become a homeowner you can't let an interest rate get in the way now it may adjust your your comfort level in terms of budget your spat yeah but hey I mean that that is what it is and you know the race could go up tomorrow and you'll be you'll have been glad you bought today and you know who pays a mortgage for 30 years at some point you're going to re-fi and you'll be watching for opportunities to to improve your payment and improve your rate I mean this is all cyclical a cyclical nature of real estate that everybody goes through over the course of their life but on the sell side yeah I mean I I feel you there it is a challenge it does make me nervous it is tough to overcome um that primary objection well I'm paying 2.5% now why would I ever want to sell this I've you know I've got equity as well so I mean we're not in that 2008 mode here where you know people are underwater over leverage that that's not happened here goodness people are in a comfortable position and they do feel like the market's still relatively in their favor because of the low inventory um but that's not to say that other factors may start coming into play um you know when we do have this level of uncertainty in the in the general macro market um you know other sectors get impacted and you know people can find themselves you know accumulating other revolving debt or there's a lot of job insecurity that's come into the fold now especially in tech brutal brutal quarter for tech this this year it's it's been I just talked to a tech recruiter yesterday and she's like she works at Oracle and she in Oracle's had all sorts of layoffs as well which I didn't realize but but yeah I mean there's tremendous job and security right now particularly a math sector yeah and what I tend to tell sellers is um you know they're there but there are there are leaks in this in this boat um it may not feel like it to you because we're talking real estate right now and you may have accumulated some equity you're paying a great rate but um if if part of your plan was to trade up from this condo to this single family home let's get it on the market don't let interest rates stand in the way because again there's a cyclical nature to that and you know there's no guarantee you will be paying 12% when you truly can't manage the space that you're living in and you're just but bursting at the seams and you don't want to wait for some of these leaks to get exposed and a higher number of sellers that feel you know and compelled to to to list their property or sell their property by force at that point the market starts turning against you and now you know you're in an over-supplied market trying to sell your property um you know just because you have leverage today and um you feel like you're in a good position now that this these these work in cycles um you know you don't need to time everything perfectly um and and it's it's almost always a trade right so whatever you feel like you may be losing on one end you get back on the other end and I try to keep people in that perspective but you're right a lot of it's tough to have conversations with people that that make any head headway because they're just they're they're they're married to this low interest comfortable position that they have had they have right now and unless they feel there's like there's a substantive reason to sell um you know they're they're pretty pretty closed about it close-minded about even considering that as an option so it's a tough time and yeah I mean obviously in this market we all want to be listing agents because it's just you know the side play um so yeah I mean it's it's yeah for the for the people that got into this business over the past two to three years uh you know this is a wake-up call and um you do have to kind of reconsider your your approach a little bit and and you know grind uh a little bit hard this is the year to grind absolutely yeah I mean you need to give yourself as many opportunities as possible and again I do think the balanced approach works um and that's I think the value of the group model is um you know more opportunities the better because they're it's it's not quite as uh abundant in terms of you know the way people are responding to to conversations nowadays a lot of people are just completely shut down about it and um you're kind of limited to people who are in a more pressing scenario where they are willing to forego um they're you know great scenario of two and a half percent and just deal with whatever interest rate they have to pay because they have to yeah yeah there there there's always going to be that market but it's it's a it's a thinner thinner pull I think there's it's a thinner pull of of clients for sure because of the I think rates or you said primary objection there and I also think it's an opportunity for agents like yourself and and our listeners to really consider to realize a couple of things that when the market thins which it is right now to some degree um although it is improving we've we've been seeing increased activity I so I'm excited uh for that um but for everyone seems to be struggling a little bit right now agent wise um but I think it's it's a good opportunity to pick up market share because I will tell you um we have another company which is a holding company for agents that aren't actively practicing and uh we started this company just to give you guys an idea of of just how how crazy this is so we this is for people who don't practice real estate but want to keep their license active okay so I'm just that's what a holding company is I don't know if every state allows it but it Illinois we allow that so we started this about eight I don't know eight or nine years ago because people would leave our company and leave the industry and we were like oh what are you doing with your license oh I'm taking to a holding company well we learned what a holding company was and then we were like oh we can we can do that anyway the reason I'm bringing this up in the last so we do almost no marketing for this we just like send out emails to agents going if you're not practicing you know do that's literally all we've done for this holding company um in the last uh since the beginning of the year we have added 120 new agents to the holding company which now puts our holding company at about 900 agents which is actually bigger than our actively producing company which has 800 agents so we are seeing a mass exodus of of REALTORS uh leaving the industry now the top agents aren't leaving of course but we're we're seeing smaller producers the ones e2z the half you know the the part-time agents starting to fall away enjoying firms like like our holding company which is great for our holding company um but it's really a telling sign for the for the industry that here in Chicago we've got about 46,000 REALTORS and um you know uh we're I think we think we're the largest holding company now but we're not the only one and the other ones must be flourishing as well and so that being said it's a great time to pick up market share and I think it's a great time for REALTORS like yourself as Iris you obviously are doing this you just answered the question about you know what do you do in a low interest rate environment what do you say to people who who have our stock in these rates and are feeling like kind of almost hamstrung like I I maybe I'd like to move but you know I don't want to double my rate and and having those conversations I think is really important in an agent can do that now because people are thinking about it right people are thinking especially if you bought your home two years ago right you're you're probably now at that point where you're settled to your home and now you're starting to think about what's next maybe you're you're in your forever home and it doesn't matter you're you're good but most of us you know aren't in our forever home so this idea of like now it's maybe a couple years in especially if you bought during that time or refinance at that time now it's like okay what's next and you're not sure and guidance and help and education is so critical and it's just I don't want to have to I don't want to really have to go to a news source to learn about what interest rates are doing and and what the market is doing like I really just want my or rather I'll give a different example what when I go to do my taxes every year I don't really want my account and just going send me receipts and you know I'll do the taxes because she does that anyway I want her to be like hey I have an idea for you like that's what I always want like oh here's a way to save more money or here's a deduction you didn't know about now does she always do that no but I I would probably pay her more if she if she said well I'm gonna add on some additional fees but this year this next year I'm gonna give you all these other ideas I would absolutely pay that because I think we're all looking for guidance and help especially around this and this is where I think the value of the REALTOR really comes in is if you can say here's why you still may want to consider going from a 3% rate to a 6.5% rate or whatever it might be today and you might say that might sound crazy but hear me out I actually have some logic here about why that could actually make sense right like that's a really compelling narrative and I think you know and it doesn't have to be a perfectly told story with like it's a slam dunk to obviously you know trash your good mortgage for for for a one that's a little bit tougher but people are thinking about that stuff anyway so I think now is the time to engage in those conversations curious to get your thoughts on that yeah I agree and to your point that you know some of the part the part time crowd is sort of thinning out I think a lot of people who you came accustomed to kind of starting on step two with clients like you they're already kind of committed to making the move you know those are the that's the low hanging fruit for those who stuck around because a lot of those agents are either just dropping out of the industry literally or figuratively they're disengaging with a lot of these prospects because um they're not not adept at having that initial conversation because they never had to before um so I think it is a time where um the you know the market is looking for knowledge and insight and guidance but more than anything else just some someone to just bounce ideas off of or someone to just be actively in communication with so I think you can find yourself cultivating a lot of relationships now that were tougher to to source um to a couple of years ago um you know anyone's you know uncle could have sold a house two years ago and you know how where was the value of being in a group or a top producer or having a track record at that point it didn't matter when the house was selling itself and you know everyone wanted to buy and sell but when we're in a little tougher market to navigate that's where um the value really comes into play and your experience and being able to talk you whether you know in today's market or reference you know again a previous cycle or or something to that effect where you can you can really inform um people about the general nature of real estate and how it does cycle through and and give them a little bit of a broader perspective of of how the market works and and kind of reassure them that you know it's there's never a perfect time um it's it's about your life and you know you can make adjustments um in the in any moment at any given time um so you don't have to sit on a fence and i think a lot of people are just kind of hanging out on this fence and they're not getting any good advice from from the people they start to talking with initially because they haven't been through this um and they they don't have enough experience um to really guide them through you know there there isn't a reference point for for some of these agents to be able to say look i mean you know i went through this uh back in 2010 with somebody or 2015 and at the end of the day you just you know you make the most of the of the current situation and you don't let that deter you from what you're trying to do with your with your life and with your timing um you know a lot of people are um you know kind of stalling on other elements of their life maybe they they don't feel like they want to sell their condo and buy a house and is it can they start a family um are they postponing getting married i mean everything kind of you know ties into each other um in terms of um people's you know natural progression through life so i do think it's valuable we become more valuable um by just being someone that that can even listen yeah more than anything else yeah you're you're you're so right um i i have just one this idea of listening is is important because i think especially when it's outside of the sale right so like outside of the sales transaction cycle you know how can you still be a listener a year after the home was sold or bought right and and and that's really a really important skill because if your client if your client knows every year or however often you know you might reach out to people that you've previously worked with um if every year they know oh my my guy checks in on me or or my my woman or or whoever right my agent checks in on me and and make sure that everything's okay make sure that i'm doing okay you know and then if if i want an updated sort of here's what my home is worth i can go to my agent they can figure that out for me if i need a plumber if i need to know what's going on with this fed rate increase i can call my agent you know agent being the consultant or the the answer person versus just the person that says this is the home that you want right because we know that people can make that decision mostly by themselves although obviously you know agents are critical for that as well but um i have one just one question for you and i always love i i just started wanting to do this uh in in more recent episodes because we want to humanize all of you know you're you're a top producer you're you're a superstar you work on a superstar team um what's a mistake that you've made with a client or in your business that you wish you hadn't or or a mistake that that you know something that you can share so that we can bring you down to our reality of imperfection but tell us tell us something that you did that uh that um you know that was a mistake oh man i mean where do i even begin i uh everything i've done well has been the result of about a dozen things i've done poorly so yeah um i think just trying to be someone i'm not or trying to be an expert in something i'm not um that's kind of come back to to bite me quite quite a handful of times um you know the ego can get in the way and i've been asked to to list or advise on properties um that i just don't have the first clue about and i need to educate myself um prior but i take it on because um i want to i mean i um i i sold about 20 parcels of land last year um in moneal and oi and you know until the client called me and and told me about them i didn't know where that was on the map i i've never heard of that yeah that's how that's how far away it must be it's pretty far away and um you know i it took me about two and a half years to sell it because it took me about a year and a half to figure out what i was selling um in the process so i did kind of make an ass out of myself on that fortunately some of the parcels were um you know ten thousand dollars a piece and the client was very patient with me but um yeah i mean getting calls from hog farmers about um you know cattle capacity or poll barns and whatnot um you know i i would say you know my biggest mistakes are not not teaching myself or not looking for guidance on something that i am not experienced with before committing yeah to to trying to sell them or or we're going to represent someone on a purchase it's you know you can you can get yourself into a little bit of soup there um but yeah i've done it a handful of times sometimes it's it's how i end up learning about what i'm lacking in terms of knowledge but um better instead of learning before the client and yeah in hindsight i would probably want to work with someone experienced first before i jump in the pool with with the client so i you know back to the serve your clients well principle you know learning on the fly isn't always the best move and i made an ass out of myself several times just uh you know kind of picking it up as i go well it's okay we're all human we all screw up all the time right so it's just uh it's a matter of learning and moving on and i appreciate you uh sharing being vulnerable and sharing that um it's it's a good lesson too it's like hey if you get this commercial opportunity and you're like i don't know about this i don't know what this is i don't know i don't even know what this sector means uh yeah maybe pass it over to someone else not you i'm saying i'm saying in general if if you find yourself in this situation um save yourself a lot of headache and uh find someone else to refer it to and then you can learn alongside them uh and still earn a part of the commission but i get it it's it's we all want to say yes to everything of course we do everybody does um it's like when somebody comes in and goes you know wants to interview with us we have eight about 800 agents and they go would you guys accept me i'm like oh we'll accept you um it's more of a matter of whether we'll meet your needs uh because we want to say yes to everyone too right and that's got not sort of trouble as well we've had we brought on agents we're like uh what were we thinking that was dumb so so i i get it even even brokerages make these kind of errors it's all just part of part of growing and um sorry i really appreciate uh your time and and i really just love how how steady you are in your business and how how sort of just you know you're not like a glitzing lamb flash guy which i love because those those types of people tend to get the most publicity of the most press um but it can be tough um those conversations i've had with people like that can be difficult because it's harder to get into the meat of like what they actually do because there's so much of an image component associated with that and i love the fact that you're like i'm just me um obviously you're a very educated person which i think also allows you to provide additional content um thank you somebody just gave us a nice comment uh on our live stream so thank you for that but anyway this is a great place to wrap up now if anyone out there by the way is has clients who are moving to the Chicago land area and you are
