[00:01:19] Today's episode is brought to you by corded.io.
[00:01:23] Are you looking for agents to join your brokerage
[00:01:26] or team?
[00:01:27] Now, as a real estate recruiter,
[00:01:28] I can tell you the answer is always yes.
[00:01:31] But most agents aren't looking to move right now.
[00:01:34] So how do you know who to contact?
[00:01:36] Well, what if I were to tell you there's a recruiting
[00:01:38] and retention tool powered by artificial intelligence
[00:01:41] that shows you exactly which agents in your local market
[00:01:44] are looking to leave their brokerage right now
[00:01:47] and which agents at your own firm are also looking
[00:01:50] to leave you?
[00:01:51] Now, I've been recruiting REALTORS for 15 years
[00:01:54] and I've hired over 2,000 agents.
[00:01:57] I can tell you with no exaggeration,
[00:01:59] this is the tool I've been waiting for.
[00:02:01] Corded's AI looks for trends across dozens of variables
[00:02:04] for each agent in your market
[00:02:06] and shows you which agents they believe are likely to move.
[00:02:09] Not only does it do that,
[00:02:11] but corded's AI went and visited my recruiting website
[00:02:14] and read everything I offer.
[00:02:16] So now when I'm recruiting,
[00:02:18] corded's AI tells me exactly what to say
[00:02:20] based on that agent's needs and what my brokerage can offer.
[00:02:24] It even writes emails for me.
[00:02:26] I've never seen anything like it
[00:02:27] and I use it every single day.
[00:02:30] Now, if you are looking to grow your brokerage,
[00:02:33] corded.io is the best tool out there.
[00:02:35] Visit corded.io to schedule a demo again.

[00:02:57] Hello and welcome to another episode of Keeping It Real,
[00:03:01] the largest podcast made by real estate agents and four real estate agents.
[00:03:05] My name is DJ Paris. I am your guide and host through the show.
[00:03:08] In just a moment, we're going to be speaking with brokerage owner Lou Adler.
[00:03:11] But we're going to be talking about
[00:03:12] 
[00:03:12] 
[00:03:12] 
[00:03:12] 
[00:03:12] before we get to Lou just a quick reminder,
[00:03:14] as always,
[00:03:14] want to thank all the new listeners who are checking out our show for the first time
[00:03:18] and welcome back to everyone who has been a fan for some time.
[00:03:22] We appreciate all of you and continue to produce these episodes
[00:03:26] to help you in your real estate career.
[00:03:28] If you are new to the show or if you're returning fan,
[00:03:31] the best way that you could help us continue to grow is by telling a friend,
[00:03:35] please think of one other agent right now that could benefit from checking out our
[00:03:39] podcast, shoot them a link. We would appreciate it and also leave us a review
[00:03:43] wherever you're listening to us on.
[00:03:46] We check those reviews. We take your suggestions and we continue to improve our show.
[00:03:50] And lastly, if there is an agent in your local market that you want to know
[00:03:55] how they're doing what they're doing,
[00:03:57] suit us a message. We will reach out to them. We will get them on the show
[00:04:00] and we will get that information to you immediately. So let us know. We work for you.
[00:04:06] And you know what, let's just jump right into it. My conversation with Lou Adler.
[00:04:23] What is the best piece of advice you've heard of those days?
[00:04:29] For me, it's actually came from one of my mentors. I'll give a quick shout out to
[00:04:34] a Sammy Muffer. And the advice was to never bet against New York.
[00:04:39] We connected with landlords and developers left and right during COVID.
[00:04:45] My business exploded during COVID. And the conversation was always like,
[00:04:50] we're losing everything to Florida. Everyone's going to move to Florida. Everyone's moving to Miami.
[00:04:55] Businesses, people. That's where the money's going. Fast forward five years, rents are higher than
[00:05:00] ever. Sales prices are higher than ever. Occurrency is higher than ever. Demand is higher than ever.
[00:05:07] So I'm a firm believer. Don't bet against New York. It's going to continuously
[00:05:13] see higher highs. And you know, it's been fun enjoying not being able to time this market.
[00:05:20] Because it's just a consistent climb. Keeps you on your toes. And what's the worst piece of advice?
[00:05:28] I think the worst piece of advice that my partner, Robert, I would have gotten that
[00:05:34] real New York is that it's not broken. Don't fix it. You know, we constantly have to evolve as
[00:05:41] a mid-sized brokerage. The industry is evolving. New York is evolving. The law has changed. 2019
[00:05:48] rent laws was a huge upheaval for our business. And if we just maintained course, you know, if we
[00:05:55] didn't consistently try to reinvent New York, if we didn't consistently grow the business and find
[00:06:01] different arms or revenue like our commercial division, like our sales division, like our rental
[00:06:06] division, like our market division, then we would have felt some service pain.
[00:06:11] Yeah, I think that's really important because things do change so quickly. I always try
[00:06:17] try this out the other day. I mean, the process of considering putting my condo on the market.
[00:06:20] And even though I don't want to give up that great rate, I have, but I have a life event. I need to
[00:06:26] make a change. And it's, it's fine. And actually, it's probably better now because there'll be less
[00:06:31] competition. And I'll probably get a little bit of a better deal than I would if the rates dropped
[00:06:35] a bunch. But yeah, well, I don't know if it's a good, I have a good broker. I have a broker
[00:06:43] that's going to save a lot of money on my commission. Of course. So happy for that. So like the only
[00:06:48] reason I have a license. But what I wanted to try was speaking of things changing is I put
[00:06:57] into chat GPT. I said, I just want to see it act. And I wrote acting as a 30 year top 1%
[00:07:04] REALTOR in not only Chicago, but I said my specific neighborhood. And you're like the expert.
[00:07:09] And I really built it up that this is who you are. You're this top agent. Here's my address.
[00:07:14] I didn't tell it anything about my condo. I just said, what would you do if you were getting
[00:07:18] this ready to sell? What would you price it at? When would you price it? Things like this. I'm
[00:07:22] just curious. How close could it get to what I thought would be good advice? And I was shocked.
[00:07:29] It was it knew it knew what kind of countertops I had. It knew all sorts of information that I
[00:07:34] didn't think it would have access to. It seemed to have a pretty good strategy for pricing. It was,
[00:07:41] you know, I'd have to double check and make sure that I think it makes sense. But it certainly
[00:07:45] wasn't far off. It might have even been right on the money. And I thought, oh boy,
[00:07:50] things are changing. And I thought, you know, the role of the REALTOR
[00:07:55] the agent is possibly changing a little as well. And I don't necessarily think it'll replace
[00:08:00] agents, although I guess it could. It's certainly a possibility. We hope that doesn't happen,
[00:08:04] of course, with all of us in this industry. And me and you needing a job. But the reality is that
[00:08:11] it is here. And people are going to be typing these kind of prompts into AI. And whether it's good
[00:08:17] advice or they're or not, people are going to be checking that stuff. So it's it's just like kind
[00:08:22] of like zest of it. It's like whether it's accurate or not, people are looking. And so I always think,
[00:08:28] you know, how can we leverage that? And what can we do to stay ahead of it? So you're right. Even though
[00:08:33] the traditional way isn't broke, it actually works really, really well. Boy, you know, things are
[00:08:38] changing. So what a great, great thing to say. By the way, my guest today is Lewis Adler. He is the
[00:08:43] co-founder and principal of real New York, one of New York City's premier midsize and full service
[00:08:49] brokerages. He has overseen the leasing and sales of thousands of apartments with his partner,
[00:08:55] Rob Romanian, hundreds of millions in sales and major new development projects all across the
[00:09:00] city. He started, we had a 300 square foot retail space and Lewis and Robert, they've grown the
[00:09:06] business to over 150 agents. Incredible. A full marketing division and over 10,000 exclusive
[00:09:12] units, which that is the bread and butter for New York. That is amazing. He's known for treating
[00:09:17] every project like his own and he specializes in residential leasing sales commercial and office
[00:09:22] to residential conversions, which is very popular in New York right now. His landlord developer
[00:09:27] first philosophy has earned him long term relationships and consistent results in shifting
[00:09:32] markets. Lewis is driven by creating lasting value for clients and adapting to New York's
[00:09:37] ever changing real estate landscape. Please visit him on his Instagram page, which is at
[00:09:43] Lou Adler and Lou, welcome to the show. Pleasure. Thank you for having me, DJ.
[00:09:49] I have to ask you a quick question. In regards to that chat, GBT, did it say DJ, you better discuss
[00:09:56] on your podcast? Is there an off market prompt that we're going to hear at the end?
[00:10:02] It's funny. That's a good one. It's funny because I, again, I'm going to double check the numbers,
[00:10:09] but I was just, I was a little shocked and I thought, oh, this is only going to get better.
[00:10:14] And I thought, okay, that scared me for a moment as somebody who has hundreds of agents here at
[00:10:19] Kale Realty in Chicago and I went, oh, and then I realized, well, it still can't solve for
[00:10:24] relationships. It still can't, and who knows, maybe it will one day, but hopefully not, I think,
[00:10:30] then they were all in trouble if it could solve for relationships. But I think it can't really do
[00:10:35] the face-to-face eye-to-eye stuff. It can't walk into a property yet and say, hmm, I, I,
[00:10:42] I want to give you my experience of what I think should be happening and it can just really evaluate
[00:10:46] data. Is it really all I can do right now? But still, I think REALTORS who aren't using or
[00:10:53] leveraging some of the usefulness of AI or probably missing out, I think there's a lot of cool
[00:10:58] things you could do. Like, I always tell agents, if you're going to a showing, just put that address
[00:11:04] in and ask it for anything it knows about the area, the property, the neighborhood, the suburb,
[00:11:09] if it's out in that way. And just what would a potential buyer might want to know about that area?
[00:11:15] And you can kind of get some useful, like, trivia facts. And I always think that's, that's fun. So
[00:11:19] there's lots of things you can do with it. And thankfully for now, it's not taken over our,
[00:11:24] our industry and hope that we're able to, you know, keep our, our control. Because I think the
[00:11:30] experience that somebody like you has in your team is obviously super important. New York is so
[00:11:35] complicated. And it is just absolutely such a building by building unit by unit experience.
[00:11:43] And it is, you really need somebody to help you navigate those waters. But yeah, let's talk about
[00:11:48] how, how'd you get into real estate? I started, you know, in college, I went to school for
[00:11:55] hospitality management business foundations. My first internship was actually with Ian Shrigger
[00:12:00] on the hospitality side. And my goal was to go into hotel development.
[00:12:05] Ian sat me down and said, quite frankly, you're not going to make the money you want to make going
[00:12:09] into the hospitality side of things. You're not going to go to work your way up and buy real estate.
[00:12:15] One day, Owen O'Towell, and he said, I think you should go into real estate development,
[00:12:19] connected me with the real estate developer that I interned for the following year. And my first
[00:12:25] job out of college was for the Durst organization. Really cut my teeth there, learned a lot about
[00:12:32] the business. Jumped into the brokerage world about three years into working for the Durst
[00:12:37] organization, where I met my business partner. And after about two weeks of dating, we call it. We
[00:12:43] decided to open up a brokerage real in New York. And wow, funny enough, we call them last Sunday.
[00:12:49] And I'm like, wow, after being partners for 13 years, it's crazy, we're still friends.
[00:12:55] I've heard horror stories. And I do think it's a big part of our secret sauce is that we,
[00:13:01] through this crazy market, through the change of costs and change of rent laws and real estate
[00:13:08] laws throughout New York through COVID. We've just maintained that partnership, maintained that
[00:13:14] brotherhood, that friendship. And it's really helped us push through some of the harder times.
[00:13:20] Yeah, I agree. I have a similar story here. I've been here 14 years and my boss, who is
[00:13:28] effectively partner and other endeavors that we have, is I have seen what he is weathered. And
[00:13:37] lots of growing pains. And also what one thing I realized that I think agents don't often understand
[00:13:45] is that being a brokerage owner is really a labor of love. And it's also, it's almost a service
[00:13:52] job because the margins, I guess maybe agents don't always understand, but margins are very slim
[00:13:58] for owners. It is, it is not the business to get into. If you just want to sit, kick back and collect
[00:14:04] checks, it is very, very tight because the competition is so fierce. There's so many opportunities.
[00:14:10] Anyone of our agents can leave us at yours at any moment. It's just how it goes. Maybe someday,
[00:14:15] they'll be employees and it'll be different. But for now, it's just, they're getting those
[00:14:18] recruiting calls every other day, just like our agents. And it's all about how well we treat and
[00:14:24] you treat your agents. And understanding there's always somebody that's going to have a better,
[00:14:29] a higher commission split or lower fees or the promise of some better, something or other
[00:14:34] and the reality of it is, is that it's all about the leadership and who can actually help people
[00:14:40] build a career and you and your partner have obviously done that and to get to 150 agents is
[00:14:46] remarkable with the amount of competition there is and you know that. And also, people can go
[00:14:52] off and do their own thing too. They can be their own thing. And so it's even harder than that.
[00:14:57] You know, and I think it's so impressive. I love indie brokerages. I think boy, they are like
[00:15:03] the American dream. But it's a struggle. And I know it's not, you can't sit back and wait. And
[00:15:10] and it too, like with us, we noticed our, the last month, we are productivity was down for our
[00:15:15] agents. Our agents, they just weren't doing as many deals. And it's like, okay, what can we do
[00:15:20] to affect that? And it's like, well, they're independent contractors. There's, you know, we can't
[00:15:25] force them to do things. We can just invite them to take advantage of these actions and help try
[00:15:30] to motivate them and get them, get them revved up. But it's one of those things where it's like,
[00:15:34] oh boy, it is, it is tough out there. So I really applaud you for that kind of work. I know, I do it
[00:15:40] firsthand. So I know how challenging it is. But it is also super rewarding when you, when you do
[00:15:45] see people build like an amazing career and you're like, wow, like I had a, I had a part in that. So,
[00:15:50] so tell us, like, tell us about New York right now. What is the experience we know during COVID?
[00:15:56] You know, there were, there was some flight out of the city. Just people wanted to save money.
[00:16:00] And they could move anywhere remote, remote working. And obviously that has changed and people have
[00:16:07] come back. But what is the state of, of buying and renting as well in New York right now?
[00:16:14] Yeah, you know, what we're seeing is everyone's back in the office at this point. You know, if it's,
[00:16:19] you know, not three days is that, you know, it's four days, you know, but I think the goal for
[00:16:24] local employers, particularly when I'm back in the office five days a week, especially after the
[00:16:29] summer. So it's really business as usual. You know, there's huge supply constraints in New York.
[00:16:36] During COVID, there wasn't a lot of building. You know, I want to discuss with you at some
[00:16:41] plans call what we're seeing on the conversion side because that's really where the inventory is
[00:16:46] coming from, you know, the office to Rezi, though, tell to Rezi, and so on. Because land is just so
[00:16:52] expensive. You can't pencil out rentals, especially in in prime neighborhoods of Manhattan, Brooklyn,
[00:16:58] and Queens. It almost only makes sense to go condo. So, you know, it's really keeping the supply
[00:17:05] down, which and demand is still high because people are, their companies are so opening up in New
[00:17:10] York. Companies are so gravitating to New York. There's a huge supply of like, you know, really high
[00:17:16] quality office space in New York. And, you know, it's been appealing to large tech firms as well.
[00:17:23] Large, you know, law firms, large financial firms, and, you know, we're constantly seeing new
[00:17:29] employment letters. People relocating, you know, people starting their first job. It's really
[00:17:35] beginning to be businesses normal since we experienced that huge pop of people coming back to the
[00:17:40] market from COVID. Yeah, how has the buy and sell side been affected? So, you know, it's funny. I
[00:17:49] people talk about rates all the time in other markets, in quite frankly, New York is just not
[00:17:55] as affected by rates, you know, where once again, it's similar where the product is on the marketplace
[00:18:02] is the supplies low and we're seeing, you know, steady demand. We're seeing, you know, generational
[00:18:08] wealth that's paying all cash. We're seeing international clientele, Asian clientele, Middle Eastern
[00:18:14] clientele paying all cash for kind of brought new development. And it's, once again, it's higher
[00:18:21] highs, you know, where we're after 2000 and need the recession, we saw a big drop off, you know,
[00:18:29] 2012, the market climbed again, dipped. And then I think we're back to, you know, the high
[00:18:36] side of the market. Yeah, that's great. I thought one thing that you could help provide some guidance
[00:18:44] on is choosing a brokerage. And I say that because you're a growing brokerage, I'm in the same boat.
[00:18:52] We both are always looking for talent. And I mean, every brokerage really is, if they're being
[00:18:58] honest, but certainly the independent brokerages, that's, you know, that's part of how we stay
[00:19:04] in business. And I always think that independent broker owners have a slightly different take on it
[00:19:14] because they often see through some of the smoking mirrors that is pushed out there from, from
[00:19:21] other of the, some maybe some of the bigger brokerages who really have a very polished and super,
[00:19:27] you know, aesthetically, a pleased, appeasing kind of kind of presentation. And in reality, you and I
[00:19:34] know that the agent, it's the agents efforts that are going to dictate their success. And yes,
[00:19:40] they should work for a great firm, of course. And they should have great training and great support
[00:19:43] and great tools. But everyone says they have great support, great training and great tools. So,
[00:19:48] I'm curious what you tell agents who are out there looking or what you might suggest to our
[00:19:53] audience. Because I always think you should do an audit. You should do an audit of the tools you have,
[00:19:58] you do an audit for your business, of the tools you guys provide and the different services you have,
[00:20:03] that's what every responsible business owner does. And agents should be doing that too with their
[00:20:07] brokerage. They should say, hey, is this still the right place for me? So, just out of curiosity, you
[00:20:11] know, if you were an agent and you were saying, you know, I have a lot of options here, right? I can,
[00:20:16] I could go other places. I'm sure there's lots of firms that would love to have me. You know, what am I
[00:20:21] looking for? And I'm curious what comes to mind for you. Yeah, I think, you know, a lot of the bigger
[00:20:26] shops are able to give the training similar to the training that we give, a lot of the bigger shops
[00:20:32] are able to, you know, potentially hand hold when an agent first gets into the business, but then
[00:20:39] what? Right, what are you offering me? What kind of opportunities do you have? Are you giving me listings?
[00:20:44] Are you giving me leads? Yeah, I think the gone are the days, okay, here's your desk, here's your
[00:20:49] phone, good luck. Yeah, you know, the relationships start aren't as abundant as they were in the past.
[00:20:55] So, you know, my business partner and my philosophy is we have to bring the opportunity in, we have to
[00:21:01] hand it to the agent, the agents that are willing to work for it. And if they bring in their own
[00:21:06] opportunities, we'll make sure to keep the fire going. We like to say, let's keep putting what on
[00:21:10] the fire. So if we see momentum, we make sure to continue that momentum with that agent. So, you
[00:21:15] know, we'll bring in a new development condo and we'll find the agent that's, you know, really
[00:21:20] putting work into that market or that specialty, like, hey, this opportunity looks perfect for you,
[00:21:25] we'll interview them internally before we introduce them to a landlord developer and see how they
[00:21:31] can leverage that opportunity. We had some of our senior agents speak to the firm yesterday,
[00:21:37] these are agents that have made millions of dollars throughout the years at Real New York and
[00:21:42] discussed how they leveraged our platform. You know, one of the agents was talking, I had my first
[00:21:47] exclusive in Grammar C, Real New York gave it to me, they gave me a shot and I met a client and
[00:21:52] didn't want this particular apartment and they were telling me what they wanted. And I was like, oh my
[00:21:56] god, you'd be crazy not to see this one. And I walked them over to West 48, she showed it to them,
[00:22:02] closed right away and, you know, the light went on. Like, I need to leverage these opportunities.
[00:22:08] Real New York, we put you in front of people. Our goal, Robyn, my goal is to put you in front of
[00:22:14] people. So I will not hire what we call door openers. Sure. If you're looking to just show up,
[00:22:22] then there's other firms for you. You know, I do believe that's the kind of agent that will be
[00:22:27] replaced by technology. But if you're here looking to build relationships, looking to connect,
[00:22:33] looking to stay consistent, my business partner and I will go to hell and back to make sure you're
[00:22:38] successful. I agree. And I'm really applaud you for for saying that because I've interviewed many
[00:22:45] broker owners over the seven years I've done the show, I have over 700 episodes and very rarely,
[00:22:52] I can think of maybe one or two other times. And I'm probably not remembering one or two others.
[00:22:57] But that's about it for owners that I have talked to that say, hey, we do go out and find deals.
[00:23:02] We do actually find opportunities for our agents. Most managing brokers and most brokerages in general
[00:23:09] do not do that. And you know that as well as as anyone. And so yeah, that is a major, major value
[00:23:16] ad that you are providing. Again, to worthy recipients, people who are actually going to demonstrate,
[00:23:23] I'm in this, I'm your partner, I want this opportunity, help me. And you know, you guys
[00:23:29] ultimately work together. But boy, that is a massive thing. So if you are an agent in the New
[00:23:34] York area, and you say that sounds pretty great. And you think that you can add value as well,
[00:23:39] because you know, Lewin and Robert, they're obviously not just handing out deals to anyone.
[00:23:45] But they are looking always for people to best represent real New York. So yes, you are building
[00:23:50] your own business as well. But to be able to have certain opportunities presented to you is,
[00:23:57] I, that is a rare experience. So congrats to you and your partner. I imagine that keeps lots of
[00:24:03] interest in your firm from agents because boy, that is that is a rare thing. So congrats to you guys.
[00:24:10] I love that. You're not just sitting back and and seeing what what the agents do themselves. But
[00:24:15] you're also are teaching them how to go out and find their own business. So let's talk about
[00:24:21] how you keep your your team motivated. So even though, yeah, rates aren't really as as, you know,
[00:24:27] as important in New York as they are, maybe elsewhere. And also the rental market being so important
[00:24:33] in New York. And also being very different that we should mention how compensation works is,
[00:24:38] is quite different in New York. Boston has a slightly similar, somewhat similar. Chicago is not
[00:24:45] that way. Here in Chicago, you know, the tenant is usually almost never paying the commission. It's
[00:24:53] very rare. It would be an unusual case. And in New York, it does, you know, the, sometimes the
[00:25:00] the landlord pays, but a lot of times the tenant is coughing up that fee. And that's, that's,
[00:25:05] that's a challenge. So I am curious, how are you keeping your team motivated? Like what are you,
[00:25:11] how are you getting, how are you having them find business? Yeah. So I think, fun enough, DGN,
[00:25:19] I'm not sure if you're aware, but there was actually a change. Yeah. I like to call it not so fair act.
[00:25:26] Yes, agreed. But quite frankly, what they did is they put the onus on the landlord to pay the
[00:25:33] broker fee. Oh, that's right. It's completely the other way now. That's right. I forgot my apologies.
[00:25:38] The tenant can still hire an agent. The tenant can still hire an agent to work for them. And in
[00:25:43] that instance, they would be responsible for paying the fee. But it's pretty amazing what happens
[00:25:50] in New York. You know, I'm all for finding ways to make the city more affordable to, you know,
[00:25:57] make sure that there is an affordability component to New York City. Unfortunately, the city
[00:26:02] doesn't know how to get out of its own way. So they enacted this law and all the properties that
[00:26:08] the tenant was paying the fee. The landlord just up the rent 10% chart and paid the fee.
[00:26:13] Sure. They got to pay it somehow. So yeah. Yeah. So instead of the tenant paying the fee once
[00:26:18] to move into an apartment, they're still paying it every year. Yeah. Oh, that's a great point.
[00:26:24] And they're not getting a 10% discount in year two. Yeah. So it's New York City, you know,
[00:26:32] once again, they can't get out of their own way. You're seeing also because of the fair act,
[00:26:38] you know, and how blokers are involved in the New York City rental market. There's less inventory
[00:26:43] online. There's less transparency. You know, there's less product that the clientele has easy access to.
[00:26:51] So, you know, it's it definitely, in my opinion, was a huge failure on the city side in moving
[00:26:58] forward with the fair act. And unfortunately, the tenant is the one who's feeling the pain.
[00:27:05] The most. Yeah. I mean, really kind of what were they thinking? I understand it's a short-term
[00:27:10] play for the consumer. Yeah, I guess. I mean, maybe you get a slight discount because you're not
[00:27:16] coughing up one month's rent initially, but you're paying it many times over because of course,
[00:27:22] that's just going to be put into the price. And everyone's going to do the same thing. And
[00:27:28] then and then the agent might even get squeezed out altogether as you were saying. So,
[00:27:33] are you seeing that where there's a lot of landlords that are just going, I'm going to try this myself
[00:27:39] now and try to keep pocket the extra money. Thanks, William, New York. We provide a ton of value on
[00:27:46] the marketing side. You know, we've always we have strong relationships with our landlords and
[00:27:51] you know, I've just partnered and I've been preparing for this. We're actually one of the brokers
[00:27:55] that were named in the red me case against the city to fight against the Fair Act.
[00:28:03] But you know, we're with the Taliban or it's like we perform my business partner, our landmords,
[00:28:09] we own properties as well. So we're at the shirt. We collect landmords and developers. So we
[00:28:13] just performed their properties and said, hey, the tenant was paying us this. You're going to be paying
[00:28:18] us this. And this is how much we're going to up your rent. And your building is going to be worth
[00:28:23] more. They're going to be renewing off of that higher rent. So net net, you win. Yeah. And your
[00:28:29] landlords looked at us and said, thank you. Let's go. Yeah, it's very easy running the numbers.
[00:28:33] Yeah, running the numbers. And we should also mention too that in New York having exclusive
[00:28:39] access is boy, that is everything. And you guys do. And you have a ton of inventory, which is also
[00:28:47] an incredible asset to have as a broker, Jonah, you have access to over 10,000 units that, you know,
[00:28:55] other agents don't. And that is amazing. And I applaud you. I know that game here in Chicago,
[00:29:02] exclusive listings are everything as well. And they're not as common here. They used to be.
[00:29:06] It used to be a kind of a thing. And today it's it's not. And maybe that's, you know, for the better
[00:29:12] for Chicago. But certainly it keeps keeps a nice premium on, you know, you're what you provide
[00:29:20] to your agents. And I it's one of the first questions I get from anyone who is interested in
[00:29:26] doing leasing. They say, do you have what tell me about your listings that are off the MLS?
[00:29:30] And of course New York doesn't doesn't work the same way. But you guys have have a huge inventory.
[00:29:35] And it's unreal. So my my hats off to you, those are those are those are hard because again,
[00:29:41] one agent who maybe has a negative experience with with one of your landlords, that could
[00:29:46] tank the relationship possibly. And you know, you're constantly having to keep those relationships
[00:29:51] strong. And I remember I'm having to do that ourselves. And so boy, I applaud you guys. You're
[00:29:57] doing some must be doing some amazing work and hiring some amazing agents because that is that's
[00:30:02] always the risk there. So, you know, let's talk about scaling a brokerage. So, you know, this is
[00:30:09] something that I don't think it's much different than building a team. And even if you're not leaving
[00:30:15] your brokerage to build your own, you're a lot of our listeners think about building a team. And
[00:30:21] essentially that's what you did. And you just put it under your own name. And now you're out there,
[00:30:26] you know, you have 150 agents strong. So tell me about what was that process like for you?
[00:30:33] Now you you said it right. So how Robin I did it is, you know, we really wanted to see the agent
[00:30:39] succeed right off the cuff. We didn't want to see that pain that an agent feels when they're just
[00:30:44] tossed into an open market. So how we looked at it is we put in the opportunities on the landlord
[00:30:50] developer side. And when we had enough opportunities to hire another agent we did. So we started off
[00:30:56] with a team of three agents, right? That we were working mostly in the lower side. Now you add product,
[00:31:02] multi-family rentals, you know, doing a couple hundred rentals a year. And we just
[00:31:08] grew with those landlords. We met new landlords and developers continuously, you know, engaged with
[00:31:16] landlords that were buying properties to show them how we could increase their rent role. And
[00:31:21] every time we got more opportunities than we can handle, we hired another agent. So we started off
[00:31:26] doing it extremely organically. Then, you know, what happened especially during COVID is there was a
[00:31:32] lot of layoffs and a lot of our competition consolidated with bigger firms. And there was a lot of
[00:31:39] talent on the employee side. So we have over 24 employees that work for us. And they're almost
[00:31:46] from every brokerage in the city. So we have a ton of a plethora of experience that we're able to
[00:31:52] distribute to our agents and help them leverage the opportunities that we bring in. So how we built
[00:31:59] our team is extremely organic. We're bootstrapped. We don't have any huge investors. We don't have
[00:32:04] any huge loans. We literally would bring in an opportunity from the landlord developer side and
[00:32:10] leverage that for more opportunities. And as we add more opportunities, we'd hire more agents. So the
[00:32:14] agents really started at specifically staffing the product that we had until they started, until we're
[00:32:21] able to train them and bring the staff in to help train them to bring in their own product.
[00:32:26] And that is a very unique way to grow a brokerage. Most brokerages do not start with those kind of
[00:32:32] opportunities. And many never present those kind of opportunities. And they're just hiring people
[00:32:39] that they hope can build their own practice without those opportunities. And the fact that you have
[00:32:45] that is truly remarkable and really unbelievable. I'm somebody who is a recruiter. I'm always
[00:32:53] looking for talent here. And boy, I can't think of any brokerage here in Chicago. That is your size
[00:33:00] that has those kind of opportunities for agents. So that must be relatively unique in New York as
[00:33:07] well, I would assume. So congratulations to you. I would hate to compete with you. So I am grateful
[00:33:14] that you are all of these coast and I am not. But let's talk about how your agents are building
[00:33:19] their own production. So you know, you're still training them. You're still coaching them. You're
[00:33:24] still showing them the way. And they're not getting handed every everything. So how do you do that?
[00:33:30] What have you found that's been effective for keeping your agents out there hustling?
[00:33:36] Yeah, we focus on how they can leverage the opportunities that we get them.
[00:33:41] Right. An example is if you bring in a new development in grammar, see the low-read side.
[00:33:47] And with the pre-deb work that Rob and I do with that developer and the floor plans and the
[00:33:54] many package we're able to hit a significant price to square fund. An example is we just finished
[00:33:59] to develop it in the grammar see area that was about 130 of fun. And that is a number on the rental
[00:34:05] side that many developers have never seen before. So we work with the agent on that product to say,
[00:34:12] hey, let's leverage it and look at other developers that are building in the area and be like, hey,
[00:34:17] you want to get 130? Smart. You can show you how to do it. And that really has been a way for our
[00:34:26] agents to advance their skillsets and advance their network and grow their business. And
[00:34:33] they keep the business that we give them and then they leverage the business to get more for
[00:34:37] themselves. And I tell the agents, if you're just looking to live off the land essentially,
[00:34:43] if you're just looking to rent the product that we give you or sell the product that we give you,
[00:34:47] once again, you're not going to make the living that you want. You're not going to be able to,
[00:34:52] especially in New York City's expensive place. In New York City is not the kind of place that you
[00:34:56] can survive on $40,000 to $50,000 a year. They have to earn and they have to earn quick. And my
[00:35:03] partner and I understand that. So we always say, if you're just looking to eat off the land,
[00:35:08] if you're just looking to work our product, this is not the place for you. You have to build alongside
[00:35:12] us. You also are, I'm really hearing a strong business to business play as opposed to B2C.
[00:35:20] And I think that just makes all the sense in the world, especially around rentals, because the
[00:35:26] listings are everything and the exclusivity is everything. And what you're really doing is teaching
[00:35:32] agents how to go after the developers and you as well. And saying, hey, this is what we did for so
[00:35:40] and so. And here's what we can do for you. And that is really a mindset shift for a lot of agents,
[00:35:46] where they are really focused on the consumer side, where they are focused on, I'm going to, I
[00:35:54] as as anyone in your position, is that you when you have the listings, the buyers and the
[00:35:59] renters show up, you know, they show up. You it makes it much easier to why people often prefer to
[00:36:07] work with either the landlord or an owner versus a tenant, specifically representing just a tenant,
[00:36:14] because of course, you know, it's all about who has control of the inventory. And so that is
[00:36:19] really, really a significant shift for a lot of agents do not think that way. And they are just
[00:36:25] focused on, I got to find a place for this person. And as opposed to, I got to find the place. And then
[00:36:31] the people will, well, it's much easier to work the other way around. And but it's much harder to get
[00:36:36] those those relationships. And that is that is your bread and butter and boy, I hope people out there
[00:36:43] are listening and hearing that is like, oh, wait a minute, are am I calling on developers?
[00:36:47] Am I reaching out to investors? Am I reaching out to people who are landlords and saying, what are
[00:36:53] your pain points around renting? Like, where are you struggling right now? And trust me, every owner,
[00:36:58] every landlord is struggles at some part of that business. And if you can come to the
[00:37:04] great problem. Yes. But the rates for the hour right now, that's that is people don't understand
[00:37:09] how difficult it is to be a landlord to dollar for New York City with where where the rates are
[00:37:13] right now. These landlords, they bought properties during COVID, expecting to refinance and the rate
[00:37:20] to be the low for is maybe five. We're mid fives to mid sixes on refinance of the multi-family
[00:37:28] properties. Sure. That the pain that they get from insurance has been seeing new high highs.
[00:37:34] The pain they get from the New York tax structure and the financing, it's not a sexy to be a landlord
[00:37:42] as it once was and the real New York, we really understand that and we do what we can to make up
[00:37:47] for that pain by making sure that they're getting the highest price for a foot possible.
[00:37:54] And how do you know or rather what is your process for securing good tenants?
[00:38:01] Because of course a bad tenant could sour a relationship and of course you don't have much control
[00:38:07] of when somebody moves in. But what are some of the things you look for or that your agents look for
[00:38:12] when they are sourcing to find tenants? Yeah. So obviously we put a lot of trust in our agent to
[00:38:20] make sure that they present the right application to our landlords and make sure that they qualify
[00:38:25] someone to more presenting to our landlords. But our structure is a little different than most where
[00:38:30] we have account managers, intermediaries in between the agent and the landlord that are constantly
[00:38:37] making sure that there's quality control that we have all the paperwork and order. You know,
[00:38:42] we're able to now do biometric screening because of AI. There's been a lot of fake employment
[00:38:48] letters and pay stubs that we've seen come through a lot of fake bank statements. So we have
[00:38:56] fortunately work with a company called OneApp that does biometric screening and can actually
[00:39:03] approve that the bank statements employment letters are legitimate.
[00:39:08] Yeah. It's a very strong tool that we need to have in this new marketplace.
[00:39:15] Yeah, I love that. That makes I did I've never I've never thought of that and absolutely that
[00:39:20] of course forgeries are probably easier than ever to do now and authenticating that is so critical.
[00:39:30] I will say when you're out there, you know, you are a brokerage that presents opportunities to agents
[00:39:36] which again, very rare, very unique and certainly something that is very sought after by agents
[00:39:45] who are wanting to grow and maybe feel like they could use some help in that arena. What do you
[00:39:51] look for in an agent? Yeah, I first of all, consistency. You know, I want to if an agent's in the
[00:40:01] office before me and after me every day, you know, like I know it's only a matter of time, you know,
[00:40:07] and then like what always the light bulb moment for me is when I see dots connected that in my
[00:40:14] opinion might not be should not be connected. For example, I hear that an agent met a client
[00:40:22] in the low-ray side and ended up renting them or selling them in an apartment in mid-tab west.
[00:40:27] I'm like, you've listened to your client, you heard what they said and you zoomed in and say,
[00:40:32] you know what, you might not be looking in the right place. Have you tried over here? You know,
[00:40:36] like when they're able to retarget and really leverage the knowledge that they have, you know,
[00:40:42] space in New York City, you want a clean block. Well, you're probably not going to find in this
[00:40:47] neighborhood. This might be the one that really fits your bill. And when I see that light go on,
[00:40:54] when I see that agent connect those dots, then I'm like, all right, this is going to be fun.
[00:40:58] You know, we're going to work together for a long time. And, you know, obviously, I scream it
[00:41:04] from the mountaintops. My agents are sick and tired of hearing it that I don't like working with
[00:41:08] door openers that, you know, if you're not building a relationship, if you're scared to pick up
[00:41:13] the phone, if you get an email from a client and it has their phone number on it, and you decide
[00:41:18] to email them back instead of calling them, you know, like there's a door that you can exit,
[00:41:23] knock yourself out, you know, and you find another place like that you are not real New York is not
[00:41:27] the place for you. If you pick up that phone, you call them and spend 45 minutes listening to them,
[00:41:32] hearing what they're actually looking for, building a relationship, seeing how this is a situation
[00:41:37] where you don't just transact once, but you transact with them through their entire real estate,
[00:41:43] you know, endeavor, but that is the agent that I want to work with.
[00:41:49] Yeah, people don't want to change providers. I don't want to change my, I just came from the dentist.
[00:41:55] I've been with my dentist for 15 years. My dentist is the only dentist I know, and I, he's not the
[00:42:00] only one that does this, but the only one I know, he does all his own clinics. And when I first
[00:42:05] worked with him, or when I first came to him, and he did that, I always had a hygienist that had
[00:42:10] done that at other places. And when I went to him, I think it was maybe the second or third time I
[00:42:15] went, so I was probably a couple of years at that point. I've said, I said, it's not a curiosity.
[00:42:19] Why do you do your own cleanings? He goes, what else am I going to do? And he sort of looked at me like,
[00:42:25] why wouldn't I do my own cleanings? And I said, well, I've been to a lot of other dentists and
[00:42:29] they don't do their own cleanings. He said, he said, yeah, he goes, it tends to create a lot of loyalty.
[00:42:35] He says, number one, it's cost-saver for me. So I don't have to pay a hygienist. And that's
[00:42:39] significant. But he goes, I like doing it. He's my job. And I went, wow. And I thought,
[00:42:45] oh, I'm never leaving this guy. Like this guy is so into his job. He's doing his cleanings.
[00:42:49] Like, and his wife is also in the practice. She does all her own cleanings. They don't even have
[00:42:53] a hygienist. And they're super successful. And I just went in a good, I'm not here to criticize
[00:42:58] other dentists that don't do it that way. Like, whatever you want to do, great. But I'm never leaving
[00:43:03] that guy because that guy cares so much about his patients that he's like, I don't even, I don't
[00:43:08] even trust that a hygienist is going to do a good job. And he even said that he's like, no one's
[00:43:12] going to do as good a job as I can. And so what I see man is doing a great job. Yeah, thank you.
[00:43:17] I appreciate that. Yeah, thanks. Thanks. But it's, but it's true, right? And it's, it's like,
[00:43:23] we don't want to look for a new dentist. We don't want to look for a new doctor. We don't want to
[00:43:27] look for a new real estate agent. We want to hopefully choose a great one and then have that great
[00:43:31] one time and time again, even after they've worked with us, they're contacting us. They're staying
[00:43:36] in touch. How's it going? How's the apartment? How's the new condo? How's everything going? You
[00:43:40] know, hey, you've, you know, and I'm sure your team is doing this. You've got account managers. You've
[00:43:45] got people to make sure you're check your check in with those tenants. You're checking in with
[00:43:49] the landlord. Hey, how is everything going? You're making sure that tenant knows, hey, if you're
[00:43:54] thinking about buying when this leases up, we're talking like we're going to, we're going to talk,
[00:43:57] we're going to figure this out for you. If you want to stay put great, we'll find another apartment
[00:44:00] too. But you guys are keeping those relationships strong. So let's talk a little bit about client
[00:44:05] loyalty. Sort of what is your opinion on that? Obviously, you have very strong client loyalty.
[00:44:11] You have developers that continue to work with you as well as the tenants themselves. So what's
[00:44:17] your philosophy around client loyalty? I can tell you first off, my business partner and I,
[00:44:23] you know, we very much have a similar mentality on how we treat our clients and, you know,
[00:44:30] how we make sure we maintain that client loyalty. You know, we've always put their commission last,
[00:44:35] we've always put the relationship first, you know, whatever we need to do to make sure that we
[00:44:40] are transacting for this developer or landlord this client we will do. You know, I, one of the
[00:44:45] best compliments I've ever gotten, the client that I worked with 12 years ago and I've transactor
[00:44:51] with them many times in New York and in the Hamptons was moving to another market and they actually
[00:44:57] reached out to me and said, hey, I found out that New York has reciprocity with this other market
[00:45:01] and this is how you can get a license and represent me to help me buy the house that I want moving
[00:45:06] forward. You know, and we've gotten time and time again, we have a landlord that we worked with one
[00:45:13] of their properties for the longest time. This was a landlord that became a good friend and mentor to us,
[00:45:18] worked on one of their properties during COVID, you know, whenever I left the city, the, you know,
[00:45:24] he represented a lot of his own product. He's like, I don't want to work on my product anymore.
[00:45:29] Here's 50 in my buildings, you know, one building began 50 because we made sure to put the
[00:45:33] relationship first and do the right job, which, you know, we're extremely proud of. But once again,
[00:45:39] the commission never gets in the way. It's all about the relationship. Rob and I will go to
[00:45:44] hell and back. When we first started, we were mopping apartments, you know, we were cleaning bathrooms.
[00:45:50] You know, there really was nothing beneath us until this day, you know, we're always happy to
[00:45:55] jump into weeds for our clients and make sure they know that we're going to put them first.
[00:45:59] And that's really important for our listeners to understand, especially with developers, with
[00:46:04] investors, they don't want to be working with lots of different real estate agents. And they certainly
[00:46:09] don't want to be bouncing between them. They want somebody that has tried and tested and goes, oh,
[00:46:14] thank God, I got the best guy. I just got to go out and find deals. I'm going to go out and find deals
[00:46:18] and do my investing thing. And then I got the team to hand it over to. And so you are absolutely
[00:46:25] right. I cannot tell you how many agents I have known over the years who just started contacting
[00:46:31] investors and developers and saying, please give me a chance. I'd love to try to rent one of your
[00:46:35] properties. And they do. And they go, you know, eventually they do such a good job that the person
[00:46:41] goes, you got to talk to my buddy or he's an investor too. Or as you know, the developers all know
[00:46:46] each other. And also too, you know, they want good, everybody wants good work. So they'll want to
[00:46:52] know like, great, you know, maybe they don't want to spend time sourcing tenants. And probably
[00:46:57] they don't. And so this is, this is where, you know, you do such good work that investors are
[00:47:02] always looking for their next deal. And so this is, that's really a smart opportunity because, you know,
[00:47:07] buyer or seller, you know, primary residents owner like myself, I'm only moving once every five to
[00:47:13] 10 years, maybe I'm in a major metropolitan area. You know, I'm, I'm, I'm not moving that much because
[00:47:18] it's just too, too much to move. And, but if I was an investor, I would always be looking for deals.
[00:47:25] So you're, you're really teaching your agents and your business as well to just make those
[00:47:30] relationships so strong because those investors are always growing. They're always looking for,
[00:47:34] for more opportunity. So I love, I love that that, that is your philosophy. It's, it's again,
[00:47:39] a bit of a paradigm shift where REALTORS often just look at the end user as the only real relationship.
[00:47:46] And yes, that's important too. Of course, because that can lead to more referrals and lots of things.
[00:47:51] But certainly getting in with investors, investors talk and they all want great brokerages and
[00:47:57] great agents. And I love that. So Lou, I think this is a great place for us to wrap up. I want to
[00:48:04] thank Lou on behalf of everyone who is listening. We really appreciate Lou Sadler and, and his team
[00:48:11] at Real New York for coming on and spending some time with us giving him giving our, our listeners
[00:48:17] their, his insight and experience and guidance. And there's a lot of great tips that you provided.
[00:48:22] So thank you. On behalf of Lewis and myself, we thank the audience. We appreciate you. You're the
[00:48:28] reason we keep doing the show. So please continue to listen and also share this episode with a friend.
[00:48:34] If you are an agent and work with other agents in your office or just meeting other agents,
[00:48:38] say, hey, I listened to this podcast. Check it out. We would appreciate that. Our advertisers would
[00:48:43] also appreciate that. So please share it with somebody that you know. And also, we just want to
[00:48:48] say thank you to everyone. We appreciate this. This is a tough market. So everybody go out there,
[00:48:53] do the activity that the other agents aren't willing to do. And you will be successful. I,
[00:48:58] Lou, I don't know if you have had this experience. But we, I've noticed that all of the top agents I
[00:49:04] talked to, especially the ones on this show, this year, they're all doing great. Almost everybody I
[00:49:09] know is doing great. It's like some of them are, this is their best year ever. And then I talk to
[00:49:14] an agent who isn't, you know, a top producer. And almost all of them are saying, this is the hardest
[00:49:19] year ever. So it's, it's amazing. I feel like I can't be both. It's got to be one or the other.
[00:49:25] And it is amazing. I'm sure you've had that same experience. I promise you the opportunity
[00:49:30] out there. Agreed. And if you are an agent in the New York area and you think, boy, Lewis Adler
[00:49:37] and Real New York, this is the kind of firm I want to associate with. I want these kind of
[00:49:42] opportunities. I want to prove to these guys that I can be trusted with their relationships,
[00:49:47] their developments. I'm going to bring them business as well. And I want to grow. This is a great
[00:49:52] opportunity to reach out and, you know, reach out to Lewis, reach out to Robert, his partner.
[00:49:56] They are always looking for talent, right? Every business is always looking for talent. So reach
[00:50:01] out to them. Follow him on Instagram, Lou Adler, at Lou Adler on Instagram. And Real New York is
[00:50:07] the company. They're amazing. And again, a success story, 13 years, 150 agents, incredible. I know
[00:50:14] what it took to get us to 150 agents. And it isn't easy. So I applaud you. You've seen a lot of
[00:50:20] brokerages come and go. You're doing it. And you guys are doing it the right way. And you are
[00:50:24] actually providing real value to your agents. So if you are a New York agent, you got to check
[00:50:30] these guys out. You know, if you're not working for them today, you probably want to consider
[00:50:35] putting them on your radar to try to impress them. So maybe they would give you an invitation
[00:50:39] one of these days. So Lou, thanks so much. On behalf of everyone, thank you. And we will see
[00:50:44] everybody on the next episode. Thanks, Lewis. Thank you, DJ. Take care.

Now, as a real estate recruiter, I can tell you the answer is always yes. But most agents aren't looking to move right now. So how do you know who to contact? Well, what if I were to tell you there's a recruiting and retention tool powered by artificial intelligence that shows you exactly which agents in your local market are looking to leave their brokerage right now and which agents at your own firm are also looking to leave you? Now, I've been recruiting REALTORS for 15 years and I've hired over 2,000 agents. I can tell you with no exaggeration, this is the tool I've been waiting for. Corded's AI looks for trends across dozens of variables for each agent in your market and shows you which agents they believe are likely to move. Not only does it do that, but corded's AI went and visited my recruiting website and read everything I offer. So now when I'm recruiting, corded's AI tells me exactly what to say based on that agent's needs and what my brokerage can offer. It even writes emails for me.

And lastly, if there is an agent in your local market that you want to know how they're doing what they're doing, suit us a message. We will reach out to them. We will get them on the show and we will get that information to you immediately. So let us know. We work for you. And you know what, let's just jump right into it. My conversation with Lou Adler. What is the best piece of advice you've heard of those days? For me, it's actually came from one of my mentors. I'll give a quick shout out to a Sammy Muffer. And the advice was to never bet against New York. We connected with landlords and developers left and right during COVID. My business exploded during COVID. And the conversation was always like, we're losing everything to Florida. Everyone's going to move to Florida. Everyone's moving to Miami. Businesses, people. That's where the money's going. Fast forward five years, rents are higher than ever. Sales prices are higher than ever. Occurrency is higher than ever. Demand is higher than ever. So I'm a firm believer. Don't bet against New York. It's going to continuously see higher highs. And you know, it's been fun enjoying not being able to time this market. Because it's just a consistent climb. Keeps you on your toes. And what's the worst piece of advice? I think the worst piece of advice that my partner, Robert, I would have gotten that real New York is that it's not broken. Don't fix it. You know, we constantly have to evolve as a mid-sized brokerage. The industry is evolving. New York is evolving. The law has changed. 2019 rent laws was a huge upheaval for our business. And if we just maintained course, you know, if we didn't consistently try to reinvent New York, if we didn't consistently grow the business and find different arms or revenue like our commercial division, like our sales division, like our rental division, like our market division, then we would have felt some service pain. Yeah, I think that's really important because things do change so quickly. I always try try this out the other day. I mean, the process of considering putting my condo on the market. And even though I don't want to give up that great rate, I have, but I have a life event. I need to make a change. And it's, it's fine. And actually, it's probably better now because there'll be less competition. And I'll probably get a little bit of a better deal than I would if the rates dropped a bunch. But yeah, well, I don't know if it's a good, I have a good broker. I have a broker that's going to save a lot of money on my commission. Of course. So happy for that. So like the only reason I have a license. But what I wanted to try was speaking of things changing is I put into chat GPT. I said, I just want to see it act. And I wrote acting as a 30 year top 1% REALTOR in not only Chicago, but I said my specific neighborhood. And you're like the expert. And I really built it up that this is who you are. You're this top agent. Here's my address. I didn't tell it anything about my condo. I just said, what would you do if you were getting this ready to sell? What would you price it at? When would you price it? Things like this. I'm just curious. How close could it get to what I thought would be good advice? And I was shocked. It was it knew it knew what kind of countertops I had. It knew all sorts of information that I didn't think it would have access to. It seemed to have a pretty good strategy for pricing. It was, you know, I'd have to double check and make sure that I think it makes sense. But it certainly wasn't far off. It might have even been right on the money. And I thought, oh boy, things are changing. And I thought, you know, the role of the REALTOR the agent is possibly changing a little as well. And I don't necessarily think it'll replace agents, although I guess it could. It's certainly a possibility. We hope that doesn't happen, of course, with all of us in this industry. And me and you needing a job. But the reality is that it is here. And people are going to be typing these kind of prompts into AI. And whether it's good advice or they're or not, people are going to be checking that stuff. So it's it's just like kind of like zest of it. It's like whether it's accurate or not, people are looking. And so I always think, you know, how can we leverage that? And what can we do to stay ahead of it? So you're right. Even though the traditional way isn't broke, it actually works really, really well. Boy, you know, things are changing. So what a great, great thing to say. By the way, my guest today is Lewis Adler. He is the co-founder and principal of real New York, one of New York City's premier midsize and full service brokerages. He has overseen the leasing and sales of thousands of apartments with his partner, Rob Romanian, hundreds of millions in sales and major new development projects all across the city. He started, we had a 300 square foot retail space and Lewis and Robert, they've grown the business to over 150 agents. Incredible. A full marketing division and over 10,000 exclusive units, which that is the bread and butter for New York. That is amazing. He's known for treating every project like his own and he specializes in residential leasing sales commercial and office to residential conversions, which is very popular in New York right now. His landlord developer first philosophy has earned him long term relationships and consistent results in shifting markets. Lewis is driven by creating lasting value for clients and adapting to New York's ever changing real estate landscape. Please visit him on his Instagram page, which is at Lou Adler and Lou, welcome to the show. Pleasure. Thank you for having me, DJ. I have to ask you a quick question. In regards to that chat, GBT, did it say DJ, you better discuss on your podcast? Is there an off market prompt that we're going to hear at the end? It's funny. That's a good one. It's funny because I, again, I'm going to double check the numbers, but I was just, I was a little shocked and I thought, oh, this is only going to get better. And I thought, okay, that scared me for a moment as somebody who has hundreds of agents here at Kale Realty in Chicago and I went, oh, and then I realized, well, it still can't solve for relationships. It still can't, and who knows, maybe it will one day, but hopefully not, I think, then they were all in trouble if it could solve for relationships. But I think it can't really do the face-to-face eye-to-eye stuff. It can't walk into a property yet and say, hmm, I, I, I want to give you my experience of what I think should be happening and it can just really evaluate data. Is it really all I can do right now? But still, I think REALTORS who aren't using or leveraging some of the usefulness of AI or probably missing out, I think there's a lot of cool things you could do. Like, I always tell agents, if you're going to a showing, just put that address in and ask it for anything it knows about the area, the property, the neighborhood, the suburb, if it's out in that way. And just what would a potential buyer might want to know about that area? And you can kind of get some useful, like, trivia facts. And I always think that's, that's fun. So there's lots of things you can do with it. And thankfully for now, it's not taken over our, our industry and hope that we're able to, you know, keep our, our control. Because I think the experience that somebody like you has in your team is obviously super important. New York is so complicated. And it is just absolutely such a building by building unit by unit experience. And it is, you really need somebody to help you navigate those waters. But yeah, let's talk about how, how'd you get into real estate? I started, you know, in college, I went to school for hospitality management business foundations. My first internship was actually with Ian Shrigger on the hospitality side. And my goal was to go into hotel development. Ian sat me down and said, quite frankly, you're not going to make the money you want to make going into the hospitality side of things. You're not going to go to work your way up and buy real estate. One day, Owen O'Towell, and he said, I think you should go into real estate development, connected me with the real estate developer that I interned for the following year. And my first job out of college was for the Durst organization. Really cut my teeth there, learned a lot about the business. Jumped into the brokerage world about three years into working for the Durst organization, where I met my business partner. And after about two weeks of dating, we call it. We decided to open up a brokerage real in New York. And wow, funny enough, we call them last Sunday. And I'm like, wow, after being partners for 13 years, it's crazy, we're still friends. I've heard horror stories. And I do think it's a big part of our secret sauce is that we, through this crazy market, through the change of costs and change of rent laws and real estate laws throughout New York through COVID. We've just maintained that partnership, maintained that brotherhood, that friendship. And it's really helped us push through some of the harder times. Yeah, I agree. I have a similar story here. I've been here 14 years and my boss, who is effectively partner and other endeavors that we have, is I have seen what he is weathered. And lots of growing pains. And also what one thing I realized that I think agents don't often understand is that being a brokerage owner is really a labor of love. And it's also, it's almost a service job because the margins, I guess maybe agents don't always understand, but margins are very slim for owners. It is, it is not the business to get into. If you just want to sit, kick back and collect checks, it is very, very tight because the competition is so fierce. There's so many opportunities. Anyone of our agents can leave us at yours at any moment. It's just how it goes. Maybe someday, they'll be employees and it'll be different. But for now, it's just, they're getting those recruiting calls every other day, just like our agents. And it's all about how well we treat and you treat your agents. And understanding there's always somebody that's going to have a better, a higher commission split or lower fees or the promise of some better, something or other and the reality of it is, is that it's all about the leadership and who can actually help people build a career and you and your partner have obviously done that and to get to 150 agents is remarkable with the amount of competition there is and you know that. And also, people can go off and do their own thing too. They can be their own thing. And so it's even harder than that. You know, and I think it's so impressive. I love indie brokerages. I think boy, they are like the American dream. But it's a struggle. And I know it's not, you can't sit back and wait. And and it too, like with us, we noticed our, the last month, we are productivity was down for our agents. Our agents, they just weren't doing as many deals. And it's like, okay, what can we do to affect that? And it's like, well, they're independent contractors. There's, you know, we can't force them to do things. We can just invite them to take advantage of these actions and help try to motivate them and get them, get them revved up. But it's one of those things where it's like, oh boy, it is, it is tough out there. So I really applaud you for that kind of work. I know, I do it firsthand. So I know how challenging it is. But it is also super rewarding when you, when you do see people build like an amazing career and you're like, wow, like I had a, I had a part in that. So, so tell us, like, tell us about New York right now. What is the experience we know during COVID? You know, there were, there was some flight out of the city. Just people wanted to save money. And they could move anywhere remote, remote working. And obviously that has changed and people have come back. But what is the state of, of buying and renting as well in New York right now? Yeah, you know, what we're seeing is everyone's back in the office at this point. You know, if it's, you know, not three days is that, you know, it's four days, you know, but I think the goal for local employers, particularly when I'm back in the office five days a week, especially after the summer. So it's really business as usual. You know, there's huge supply constraints in New York. During COVID, there wasn't a lot of building. You know, I want to discuss with you at some plans call what we're seeing on the conversion side because that's really where the inventory is coming from, you know, the office to Rezi, though, tell to Rezi, and so on. Because land is just so expensive. You can't pencil out rentals, especially in in prime neighborhoods of Manhattan, Brooklyn, and Queens. It almost only makes sense to go condo. So, you know, it's really keeping the supply down, which and demand is still high because people are, their companies are so opening up in New York. Companies are so gravitating to New York. There's a huge supply of like, you know, really high quality office space in New York. And, you know, it's been appealing to large tech firms as well. Large, you know, law firms, large financial firms, and, you know, we're constantly seeing new employment letters. People relocating, you know, people starting their first job. It's really beginning to be businesses normal since we experienced that huge pop of people coming back to the market from COVID. Yeah, how has the buy and sell side been affected? So, you know, it's funny. I people talk about rates all the time in other markets, in quite frankly, New York is just not as affected by rates, you know, where once again, it's similar where the product is on the marketplace is the supplies low and we're seeing, you know, steady demand. We're seeing, you know, generational wealth that's paying all cash. We're seeing international clientele, Asian clientele, Middle Eastern clientele paying all cash for kind of brought new development. And it's, once again, it's higher highs, you know, where we're after 2000 and need the recession, we saw a big drop off, you know, 2012, the market climbed again, dipped. And then I think we're back to, you know, the high side of the market. Yeah, that's great. I thought one thing that you could help provide some guidance on is choosing a brokerage. And I say that because you're a growing brokerage, I'm in the same boat. We both are always looking for talent. And I mean, every brokerage really is, if they're being honest, but certainly the independent brokerages, that's, you know, that's part of how we stay in business. And I always think that independent broker owners have a slightly different take on it because they often see through some of the smoking mirrors that is pushed out there from, from other of the, some maybe some of the bigger brokerages who really have a very polished and super, you know, aesthetically, a pleased, appeasing kind of kind of presentation. And in reality, you and I know that the agent, it's the agents efforts that are going to dictate their success. And yes, they should work for a great firm, of course. And they should have great training and great support and great tools. But everyone says they have great support, great training and great tools. So, I'm curious what you tell agents who are out there looking or what you might suggest to our audience. Because I always think you should do an audit. You should do an audit of the tools you have, you do an audit for your business, of the tools you guys provide and the different services you have, that's what every responsible business owner does. And agents should be doing that too with their brokerage. They should say, hey, is this still the right place for me? So, just out of curiosity, you know, if you were an agent and you were saying, you know, I have a lot of options here, right? I can, I could go other places. I'm sure there's lots of firms that would love to have me. You know, what am I looking for? And I'm curious what comes to mind for you. Yeah, I think, you know, a lot of the bigger shops are able to give the training similar to the training that we give, a lot of the bigger shops are able to, you know, potentially hand hold when an agent first gets into the business, but then what? Right, what are you offering me? What kind of opportunities do you have? Are you giving me listings? Are you giving me leads? Yeah, I think the gone are the days, okay, here's your desk, here's your phone, good luck. Yeah, you know, the relationships start aren't as abundant as they were in the past. So, you know, my business partner and my philosophy is we have to bring the opportunity in, we have to hand it to the agent, the agents that are willing to work for it. And if they bring in their own opportunities, we'll make sure to keep the fire going. We like to say, let's keep putting what on the fire. So if we see momentum, we make sure to continue that momentum with that agent. So, you know, we'll bring in a new development condo and we'll find the agent that's, you know, really putting work into that market or that specialty, like, hey, this opportunity looks perfect for you, we'll interview them internally before we introduce them to a landlord developer and see how they can leverage that opportunity. We had some of our senior agents speak to the firm yesterday, these are agents that have made millions of dollars throughout the years at Real New York and discussed how they leveraged our platform. You know, one of the agents was talking, I had my first exclusive in Grammar C, Real New York gave it to me, they gave me a shot and I met a client and didn't want this particular apartment and they were telling me what they wanted. And I was like, oh my god, you'd be crazy not to see this one. And I walked them over to West 48, she showed it to them, closed right away and, you know, the light went on. Like, I need to leverage these opportunities. Real New York, we put you in front of people. Our goal, Robyn, my goal is to put you in front of people. So I will not hire what we call door openers. Sure. If you're looking to just show up, then there's other firms for you. You know, I do believe that's the kind of agent that will be replaced by technology. But if you're here looking to build relationships, looking to connect, looking to stay consistent, my business partner and I will go to hell and back to make sure you're successful. I agree. And I'm really applaud you for for saying that because I've interviewed many broker owners over the seven years I've done the show, I have over 700 episodes and very rarely, I can think of maybe one or two other times. And I'm probably not remembering one or two others. But that's about it for owners that I have talked to that say, hey, we do go out and find deals. We do actually find opportunities for our agents. Most managing brokers and most brokerages in general do not do that. And you know that as well as as anyone. And so yeah, that is a major, major value ad that you are providing. Again, to worthy recipients, people who are actually going to demonstrate, I'm in this, I'm your partner, I want this opportunity, help me. And you know, you guys ultimately work together. But boy, that is a massive thing. So if you are an agent in the New York area, and you say that sounds pretty great. And you think that you can add value as well, because you know, Lewin and Robert, they're obviously not just handing out deals to anyone. But they are looking always for people to best represent real New York. So yes, you are building your own business as well. But to be able to have certain opportunities presented to you is, I, that is a rare experience. So congrats to you and your partner. I imagine that keeps lots of interest in your firm from agents because boy, that is that is a rare thing. So congrats to you guys. I love that. You're not just sitting back and and seeing what what the agents do themselves. But you're also are teaching them how to go out and find their own business. So let's talk about how you keep your your team motivated. So even though, yeah, rates aren't really as as, you know, as important in New York as they are, maybe elsewhere. And also the rental market being so important in New York. And also being very different that we should mention how compensation works is, is quite different in New York. Boston has a slightly similar, somewhat similar. Chicago is not that way. Here in Chicago, you know, the tenant is usually almost never paying the commission. It's very rare. It would be an unusual case. And in New York, it does, you know, the, sometimes the the landlord pays, but a lot of times the tenant is coughing up that fee. And that's, that's, that's a challenge. So I am curious, how are you keeping your team motivated? Like what are you, how are you getting, how are you having them find business? Yeah. So I think, fun enough, DGN, I'm not sure if you're aware, but there was actually a change. Yeah. I like to call it not so fair act. Yes, agreed. But quite frankly, what they did is they put the onus on the landlord to pay the broker fee. Oh, that's right. It's completely the other way now. That's right. I forgot my apologies. The tenant can still hire an agent. The tenant can still hire an agent to work for them. And in that instance, they would be responsible for paying the fee. But it's pretty amazing what happens in New York. You know, I'm all for finding ways to make the city more affordable to, you know, make sure that there is an affordability component to New York City. Unfortunately, the city doesn't know how to get out of its own way. So they enacted this law and all the properties that the tenant was paying the fee. The landlord just up the rent 10% chart and paid the fee. Sure. They got to pay it somehow. So yeah. Yeah. So instead of the tenant paying the fee once to move into an apartment, they're still paying it every year. Yeah. Oh, that's a great point. And they're not getting a 10% discount in year two. Yeah. So it's New York City, you know, once again, they can't get out of their own way. You're seeing also because of the fair act, you know, and how blokers are involved in the New York City rental market. There's less inventory online. There's less transparency. You know, there's less product that the clientele has easy access to. So, you know, it's it definitely, in my opinion, was a huge failure on the city side in moving forward with the fair act. And unfortunately, the tenant is the one who's feeling the pain. The most. Yeah. I mean, really kind of what were they thinking? I understand it's a short-term play for the consumer. Yeah, I guess. I mean, maybe you get a slight discount because you're not coughing up one month's rent initially, but you're paying it many times over because of course, that's just going to be put into the price. And everyone's going to do the same thing. And then and then the agent might even get squeezed out altogether as you were saying. So, are you seeing that where there's a lot of landlords that are just going, I'm going to try this myself now and try to keep pocket the extra money. Thanks, William, New York. We provide a ton of value on the marketing side. You know, we've always we have strong relationships with our landlords and you know, I've just partnered and I've been preparing for this. We're actually one of the brokers that were named in the red me case against the city to fight against the Fair Act. But you know, we're with the Taliban or it's like we perform my business partner, our landmords, we own properties as well. So we're at the shirt. We collect landmords and developers. So we just performed their properties and said, hey, the tenant was paying us this. You're going to be paying us this. And this is how much we're going to up your rent. And your building is going to be worth more. They're going to be renewing off of that higher rent. So net net, you win. Yeah. And your landlords looked at us and said, thank you. Let's go. Yeah, it's very easy running the numbers. Yeah, running the numbers. And we should also mention too that in New York having exclusive access is boy, that is everything. And you guys do. And you have a ton of inventory, which is also an incredible asset to have as a broker, Jonah, you have access to over 10,000 units that, you know, other agents don't. And that is amazing. And I applaud you. I know that game here in Chicago, exclusive listings are everything as well. And they're not as common here. They used to be. It used to be a kind of a thing. And today it's it's not. And maybe that's, you know, for the better for Chicago. But certainly it keeps keeps a nice premium on, you know, you're what you provide to your agents. And I it's one of the first questions I get from anyone who is interested in doing leasing. They say, do you have what tell me about your listings that are off the MLS? And of course New York doesn't doesn't work the same way. But you guys have have a huge inventory. And it's unreal. So my my hats off to you, those are those are those are hard because again, one agent who maybe has a negative experience with with one of your landlords, that could tank the relationship possibly. And you know, you're constantly having to keep those relationships strong. And I remember I'm having to do that ourselves. And so boy, I applaud you guys. You're doing some must be doing some amazing work and hiring some amazing agents because that is that's always the risk there. So, you know, let's talk about scaling a brokerage. So, you know, this is something that I don't think it's much different than building a team. And even if you're not leaving your brokerage to build your own, you're a lot of our listeners think about building a team. And essentially that's what you did. And you just put it under your own name. And now you're out there, you know, you have 150 agents strong. So tell me about what was that process like for you? Now you you said it right. So how Robin I did it is, you know, we really wanted to see the agent succeed right off the cuff. We didn't want to see that pain that an agent feels when they're just tossed into an open market. So how we looked at it is we put in the opportunities on the landlord developer side. And when we had enough opportunities to hire another agent we did. So we started off with a team of three agents, right? That we were working mostly in the lower side. Now you add product, multi-family rentals, you know, doing a couple hundred rentals a year. And we just grew with those landlords. We met new landlords and developers continuously, you know, engaged with landlords that were buying properties to show them how we could increase their rent role. And every time we got more opportunities than we can handle, we hired another agent. So we started off doing it extremely organically. Then, you know, what happened especially during COVID is there was a lot of layoffs and a lot of our competition consolidated with bigger firms. And there was a lot of talent on the employee side. So we have over 24 employees that work for us. And they're almost from every brokerage in the city. So we have a ton of a plethora of experience that we're able to distribute to our agents and help them leverage the opportunities that we bring in. So how we built our team is extremely organic. We're bootstrapped. We don't have any huge investors. We don't have any huge loans. We literally would bring in an opportunity from the landlord developer side and leverage that for more opportunities. And as we add more opportunities, we'd hire more agents. So the agents really started at specifically staffing the product that we had until they started, until we're able to train them and bring the staff in to help train them to bring in their own product. And that is a very unique way to grow a brokerage. Most brokerages do not start with those kind of opportunities. And many never present those kind of opportunities. And they're just hiring people that they hope can build their own practice without those opportunities. And the fact that you have that is truly remarkable and really unbelievable. I'm somebody who is a recruiter. I'm always looking for talent here. And boy, I can't think of any brokerage here in Chicago. That is your size that has those kind of opportunities for agents. So that must be relatively unique in New York as well, I would assume. So congratulations to you. I would hate to compete with you. So I am grateful that you are all of these coast and I am not. But let's talk about how your agents are building their own production. So you know, you're still training them. You're still coaching them. You're still showing them the way. And they're not getting handed every everything. So how do you do that? What have you found that's been effective for keeping your agents out there hustling? Yeah, we focus on how they can leverage the opportunities that we get them. Right. An example is if you bring in a new development in grammar, see the low-read side. And with the pre-deb work that Rob and I do with that developer and the floor plans and the many package we're able to hit a significant price to square fund. An example is we just finished to develop it in the grammar see area that was about 130 of fun. And that is a number on the rental side that many developers have never seen before. So we work with the agent on that product to say, hey, let's leverage it and look at other developers that are building in the area and be like, hey, you want to get 130? Smart. You can show you how to do it. And that really has been a way for our agents to advance their skillsets and advance their network and grow their business. And they keep the business that we give them and then they leverage the business to get more for themselves. And I tell the agents, if you're just looking to live off the land essentially, if you're just looking to rent the product that we give you or sell the product that we give you, once again, you're not going to make the living that you want. You're not going to be able to, especially in New York City's expensive place. In New York City is not the kind of place that you can survive on $40,000 to $50,000 a year. They have to earn and they have to earn quick. And my partner and I understand that. So we always say, if you're just looking to eat off the land, if you're just looking to work our product, this is not the place for you. You have to build alongside us. You also are, I'm really hearing a strong business to business play as opposed to B2C. And I think that just makes all the sense in the world, especially around rentals, because the listings are everything and the exclusivity is everything. And what you're really doing is teaching agents how to go after the developers and you as well. And saying, hey, this is what we did for so and so. And here's what we can do for you. And that is really a mindset shift for a lot of agents, where they are really focused on the consumer side, where they are focused on, I'm going to, I as as anyone in your position, is that you when you have the listings, the buyers and the renters show up, you know, they show up. You it makes it much easier to why people often prefer to work with either the landlord or an owner versus a tenant, specifically representing just a tenant, because of course, you know, it's all about who has control of the inventory. And so that is really, really a significant shift for a lot of agents do not think that way. And they are just focused on, I got to find a place for this person. And as opposed to, I got to find the place. And then the people will, well, it's much easier to work the other way around. And but it's much harder to get those those relationships. And that is that is your bread and butter and boy, I hope people out there are listening and hearing that is like, oh, wait a minute, are am I calling on developers? Am I reaching out to investors? Am I reaching out to people who are landlords and saying, what are your pain points around renting? Like, where are you struggling right now? And trust me, every owner, every landlord is struggles at some part of that business. And if you can come to the great problem. Yes. But the rates for the hour right now, that's that is people don't understand how difficult it is to be a landlord to dollar for New York City with where where the rates are right now. These landlords, they bought properties during COVID, expecting to refinance and the rate to be the low for is maybe five. We're mid fives to mid sixes on refinance of the multi-family properties. Sure. That the pain that they get from insurance has been seeing new high highs. The pain they get from the New York tax structure and the financing, it's not a sexy to be a landlord as it once was and the real New York, we really understand that and we do what we can to make up for that pain by making sure that they're getting the highest price for a foot possible. And how do you know or rather what is your process for securing good tenants? Because of course a bad tenant could sour a relationship and of course you don't have much control of when somebody moves in. But what are some of the things you look for or that your agents look for when they are sourcing to find tenants? Yeah. So obviously we put a lot of trust in our agent to make sure that they present the right application to our landlords and make sure that they qualify someone to more presenting to our landlords. But our structure is a little different than most where we have account managers, intermediaries in between the agent and the landlord that are constantly making sure that there's quality control that we have all the paperwork and order. You know, we're able to now do biometric screening because of AI. There's been a lot of fake employment letters and pay stubs that we've seen come through a lot of fake bank statements. So we have fortunately work with a company called OneApp that does biometric screening and can actually approve that the bank statements employment letters are legitimate. Yeah. It's a very strong tool that we need to have in this new marketplace. Yeah, I love that. That makes I did I've never I've never thought of that and absolutely that of course forgeries are probably easier than ever to do now and authenticating that is so critical. I will say when you're out there, you know, you are a brokerage that presents opportunities to agents which again, very rare, very unique and certainly something that is very sought after by agents who are wanting to grow and maybe feel like they could use some help in that arena. What do you look for in an agent? Yeah, I first of all, consistency. You know, I want to if an agent's in the office before me and after me every day, you know, like I know it's only a matter of time, you know, and then like what always the light bulb moment for me is when I see dots connected that in my opinion might not be should not be connected. For example, I hear that an agent met a client in the low-ray side and ended up renting them or selling them in an apartment in mid-tab west. I'm like, you've listened to your client, you heard what they said and you zoomed in and say, you know what, you might not be looking in the right place. Have you tried over here? You know, like when they're able to retarget and really leverage the knowledge that they have, you know, space in New York City, you want a clean block. Well, you're probably not going to find in this neighborhood. This might be the one that really fits your bill. And when I see that light go on, when I see that agent connect those dots, then I'm like, all right, this is going to be fun. You know, we're going to work together for a long time. And, you know, obviously, I scream it from the mountaintops. My agents are sick and tired of hearing it that I don't like working with door openers that, you know, if you're not building a relationship, if you're scared to pick up the phone, if you get an email from a client and it has their phone number on it, and you decide to email them back instead of calling them, you know, like there's a door that you can exit, knock yourself out, you know, and you find another place like that you are not real New York is not the place for you. If you pick up that phone, you call them and spend 45 minutes listening to them, hearing what they're actually looking for, building a relationship, seeing how this is a situation where you don't just transact once, but you transact with them through their entire real estate, you know, endeavor, but that is the agent that I want to work with. Yeah, people don't want to change providers. I don't want to change my, I just came from the dentist. I've been with my dentist for 15 years. My dentist is the only dentist I know, and I, he's not the only one that does this, but the only one I know, he does all his own clinics. And when I first worked with him, or when I first came to him, and he did that, I always had a hygienist that had done that at other places. And when I went to him, I think it was maybe the second or third time I went, so I was probably a couple of years at that point. I've said, I said, it's not a curiosity. Why do you do your own cleanings? He goes, what else am I going to do? And he sort of looked at me like, why wouldn't I do my own cleanings? And I said, well, I've been to a lot of other dentists and they don't do their own cleanings. He said, he said, yeah, he goes, it tends to create a lot of loyalty. He says, number one, it's cost-saver for me. So I don't have to pay a hygienist. And that's significant. But he goes, I like doing it. He's my job. And I went, wow. And I thought, oh, I'm never leaving this guy. Like this guy is so into his job. He's doing his cleanings. Like, and his wife is also in the practice. She does all her own cleanings. They don't even have a hygienist. And they're super successful. And I just went in a good, I'm not here to criticize other dentists that don't do it that way. Like, whatever you want to do, great. But I'm never leaving that guy because that guy cares so much about his patients that he's like, I don't even, I don't even trust that a hygienist is going to do a good job. And he even said that he's like, no one's going to do as good a job as I can. And so what I see man is doing a great job. Yeah, thank you. I appreciate that. Yeah, thanks. Thanks. But it's, but it's true, right? And it's, it's like, we don't want to look for a new dentist. We don't want to look for a new doctor. We don't want to look for a new real estate agent. We want to hopefully choose a great one and then have that great one time and time again, even after they've worked with us, they're contacting us. They're staying in touch. How's it going? How's the apartment? How's the new condo? How's everything going? You know, hey, you've, you know, and I'm sure your team is doing this. You've got account managers. You've got people to make sure you're check your check in with those tenants. You're checking in with the landlord. Hey, how is everything going? You're making sure that tenant knows, hey, if you're thinking about buying when this leases up, we're talking like we're going to, we're going to talk, we're going to figure this out for you. If you want to stay put great, we'll find another apartment too. But you guys are keeping those relationships strong. So let's talk a little bit about client loyalty. Sort of what is your opinion on that? Obviously, you have very strong client loyalty. You have developers that continue to work with you as well as the tenants themselves. So what's your philosophy around client loyalty? I can tell you first off, my business partner and I, you know, we very much have a similar mentality on how we treat our clients and, you know, how we make sure we maintain that client loyalty. You know, we've always put their commission last, we've always put the relationship first, you know, whatever we need to do to make sure that we are transacting for this developer or landlord this client we will do. You know, I, one of the best compliments I've ever gotten, the client that I worked with 12 years ago and I've transactor with them many times in New York and in the Hamptons was moving to another market and they actually reached out to me and said, hey, I found out that New York has reciprocity with this other market and this is how you can get a license and represent me to help me buy the house that I want moving forward. You know, and we've gotten time and time again, we have a landlord that we worked with one of their properties for the longest time. This was a landlord that became a good friend and mentor to us, worked on one of their properties during COVID, you know, whenever I left the city, the, you know, he represented a lot of his own product. He's like, I don't want to work on my product anymore. Here's 50 in my buildings, you know, one building began 50 because we made sure to put the relationship first and do the right job, which, you know, we're extremely proud of. But once again, the commission never gets in the way. It's all about the relationship. Rob and I will go to hell and back. When we first started, we were mopping apartments, you know, we were cleaning bathrooms. You know, there really was nothing beneath us until this day, you know, we're always happy to jump into weeds for our clients and make sure they know that we're going to put them first. And that's really important for our listeners to understand, especially with developers, with investors, they don't want to be working with lots of different real estate agents. And they certainly don't want to be bouncing between them. They want somebody that has tried and tested and goes, oh, thank God, I got the best guy. I just got to go out and find deals. I'm going to go out and find deals and do my investing thing. And then I got the team to hand it over to. And so you are absolutely right. I cannot tell you how many agents I have known over the years who just started contacting investors and developers and saying, please give me a chance. I'd love to try to rent one of your properties. And they do. And they go, you know, eventually they do such a good job that the person goes, you got to talk to my buddy or he's an investor too. Or as you know, the developers all know each other. And also too, you know, they want good, everybody wants good work. So they'll want to know like, great, you know, maybe they don't want to spend time sourcing tenants. And probably they don't. And so this is, this is where, you know, you do such good work that investors are always looking for their next deal. And so this is, that's really a smart opportunity because, you know, buyer or seller, you know, primary residents owner like myself, I'm only moving once every five to 10 years, maybe I'm in a major metropolitan area. You know, I'm, I'm, I'm not moving that much because it's just too, too much to move. And, but if I was an investor, I would always be looking for deals. So you're, you're really teaching your agents and your business as well to just make those relationships so strong because those investors are always growing. They're always looking for, for more opportunity. So I love, I love that that, that is your philosophy. It's, it's again, a bit of a paradigm shift where REALTORS often just look at the end user as the only real relationship. And yes, that's important too. Of course, because that can lead to more referrals and lots of things. But certainly getting in with investors, investors talk and they all want great brokerages and great agents. And I love that. So Lou, I think this is a great place for us to wrap up. I want to thank Lou on behalf of everyone who is listening. We really appreciate Lou Sadler and, and his team at Real New York for coming on and spending some time with us giving him giving our, our listeners their, his insight and experience and guidance.

So everybody go out there, do the activity that the other agents aren't willing to do. And you will be successful. I, Lou, I don't know if you have had this experience. But we, I've noticed that all of the top agents I talked to, especially the ones on this show, this year, they're all doing great. Almost everybody I know is doing great. It's like some of them are, this is their best year ever. And then I talk to an agent who isn't, you know, a top producer. And almost all of them are saying, this is the hardest year ever. So it's, it's amazing. I feel like I can't be both. It's got to be one or the other. And it is amazing. I'm sure you've had that same experience. I promise you the opportunity out there. Agreed.
