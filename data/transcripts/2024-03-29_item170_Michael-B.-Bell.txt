[00:03:54] Michael, welcome to the show. Thank you DJ. I appreciate it.
[00:03:57] I appreciate, appreciate you and really all that you have done in the industry.
[00:04:03] It's really a remarkable career at least in my estimation.
[00:04:08] And I talk to people like you a lot or agents who are at your level.
[00:04:12] And I'm always just blown away by what you have built in particular and writing a book to give back, I think is really fantastic too.
[00:04:21] But I'd love to start at the beginning of the story. So you've been in real estate for quite some time.
[00:04:26] Tell us how you got in. Was this something you always wanted to do or do you fall into it or how did you how'd you get involved?
[00:04:33] Well, let's thank you for the introduction. It made me feel old.
[00:04:38] So well, I'm 54 years old. I started by buying houses and flipping them. And I couldn't find a good REALTOR to help me.
[00:04:46] I just I'm into the details and I just I couldn't even find one to get a real estate sign up on time or that wasn't crooked.
[00:04:56] So at the time my girlfriend said you should get your own license, get your broker's license and represent yourself and wow, what a phenomenal idea.
[00:05:04] So I started flipping homes representing myself. And then I had neighbors say, gosh, she did such a great job.
[00:05:11] Can you represent me? Can you sell my house for me? And I kind of thought, well, that's a great idea.
[00:05:15] And I got to I got to know a lot of the REALTOR is locally. They liked the way I performed what I did and how I did it.
[00:05:22] And I was I was young. I was in my 20s. And I was the I had I started my own brokerage.
[00:05:28] And I was the youngest practicing broker in Pasadena. And I hated it.
[00:05:34] We ever seen that super bowl commercial was years ago. It's for Yahoo. And it was these cowboys that are going over the over the planes.
[00:05:41] And they're trying to lasso of all things kitty cats. Yeah, I remember that. That was awesome. Wasn't it?
[00:05:48] And it was I that at that time when I saw that commercial, I thought to myself, I got to get out of this. I did not like managing people. I don't know how you do it.
[00:05:57] But I kind of felt like after after about 10 years of doing that, I'm better off in sales. I never thought I was a sales guy.
[00:06:05] I thought it'd be horrible. I thought it'd be a great manager. It's just it's the opposite.
[00:06:09] I want to be really good at sales. I've always taken kind of a different path, which we'll talk about in the book and how I try to differentiate myself in front of sellers.
[00:06:22] But I want to sell in the brokerage. And so I've been a practicing agent with one assistant for the last 18 years, something like that.
[00:06:33] It's it is interesting. You know, I sort of have a different path, but but a similar sort of realization. So I don't think fully you would not want me to manage our agents. We have almost 800 of them.
[00:06:46] And I would be the I would be a terrible manager because I need everybody to like me. And that makes me sort of by default, not a very objective manager. So thankfully, I realized in my role here that I was best at this one thing, which is in my case recruiting agents.
[00:07:02] And because when you need people to like you, you're probably decent at sales. And so I really consider myself on the sales side as well. So I can absolutely appreciate that.
[00:07:12] But I also also appreciate how hard it is to run a brokerage, especially now right now with, with of course, all the changes that that may or may not be coming everyone's way.
[00:07:21] But I would love to find out because even though you started, you know, decades ago, and I apologize. I'm not trying to make you feel old.
[00:07:29] You and I are not far apart, and age, by the way, we are very close in age. But I would like to know about being in your 20s and finding clientele because to me, that seems like a very difficult task.
[00:07:41] We have lots of people who are in their 20s who listen to the show and who may be struggling in that way. So I'm curious. You know, you were the youngest broker in Pasadena. You were very successful in your early days. Of course, you're still successful today.
[00:07:55] By the way, we should mention Michael is a point. So we said he's a point top point 1% producer. He's also with his company, Sotheby's a top point 3% producer worldwide with Sotheby's, which is obviously we know how what a white glove firm Sotheby's is. So you're obviously very accomplished. But how did you, how did you start building your business in your 20s? Was that difficult for you?
[00:08:17] It's tough. Look, I'm 54 and people say I look a lot younger or I look good for when I was in my 20s, I looked a lot younger too.
[00:08:29] There's a few things that actually I didn't expect this question. There's a thing out there called imposter syndrome. And if you're not aware of it, look it up.
[00:08:41] And I think it's very, at least for me was very natural. I kind of felt like I, in a way I was an imposter. Like how, how could I be selling, you know, back then, a $800,000 house or a million dollar house. I'm only 26 years old. And I felt like an imposter.
[00:09:00] I think part of getting over that is just to understand the syndrome, you know, just to really understand just when you identify the problem as now you can see it and now you can kind of develop tools to go over to overcome that.
[00:09:17] The other thing is, I think in anything in the world, anything you want to succeed in life, you got to lean into it and you have to be willing to fail. And I failed a lot. I screwed up a lot of listening presentations.
[00:09:30] But then I learned. And I learned what to say. And I learned certainly what not to say. And I learned how long you're supposed to talk and how long, you know, we have two years in one mouth.
[00:09:40] You know, you should be listening more than you're talking. But you and I can talk about all the little nuances of all of that, what you should be and should not be doing. But I felt like I learned that in the early age.
[00:09:55] And for me, also the other thing is I love education. I love learning. And I've always kind of realized that I would rather learn from the path of successful people than learn on my own.
[00:10:06] So I got into training. I have a coach. I'm coaching with Steve Scholl. I know everybody kind of knows that guy. He talks about tactical empathy and emotional intelligence. And if you don't know what I'm talking about, you need to go out and buy the book.
[00:10:20] And I think the book it's called never split the difference from boss. I forgot that first name.
[00:10:29] An absolute, an absolute game changer in how you talk with people and negotiate with people. But I think it's, you know, going, as my, what went through my journey, I always realized the people that were the most accessible were the ones that were trainable.
[00:10:47] And yeah, interesting.
[00:10:49] And if you don't have the money, I know the coaching is expensive real estate coaching with a company can, you know, like it.
[00:10:56] One of my old companies is either 500 bucks a month for a group coaching thing or it'd be like a thousand or 1500 bucks for a half hour every week.
[00:11:04] There's a lot of free stuff out there. I mean, you can go to.
[00:11:09] You can go to the other guy forgot.
[00:11:12] Fairy.
[00:11:13] Fairy. And fairy has so much stuff online that you, you know, you almost don't, you don't need to pay for any of it.
[00:11:20] But it's just, it's great free content. But I think if, you know, this real estate is a practice. It's a practice of real estate. We're all practicing.
[00:11:28] You should keep that practice and going. You need to learn all of the, you need to know, know what to say, what not to say.
[00:11:35] And, you know, it's one of the things I know I'm going off on tangents, but I've got a lot to say about this.
[00:11:41] My brother, my younger brother is a really successful chiropractor.
[00:11:46] And he's up in Portland and he sees about 150 people a day.
[00:11:52] Whoa.
[00:11:53] What's, yeah, and they call him a healer. And I don't know.
[00:11:56] It doesn't matter what you think about chiropractors, but this is what resonated with me. It was like 20 years ago.
[00:12:03] He had called, we had chatted and he said that, you know, he just went to a seminar over a weekend.
[00:12:09] I'm like, so what kind of a seminar, you know, because there's so many different seminars for these guys.
[00:12:14] And he went to a seminar on dialogues. What to say to people.
[00:12:17] You know, the thing is if he helps adjust somebody, you know, a hundred times, you can't say a hundred different things.
[00:12:24] But whatever you say, you should, you should be able to nail it.
[00:12:27] And you, and I thought to myself, if my brother who's a chiropractor sees the value and understand dialogue.
[00:12:36] And most REALTORS, you know, they stick their nose up to it.
[00:12:39] They stick their nose up to training and they stick their nose up to what to say and how to handle objections.
[00:12:44] But for me, that was, that was, I always believed in it. And then I really believed in it.
[00:12:50] So I think if you're a real estate agent, you really need to learn what to say and what not to say.
[00:12:55] Yeah. And you're right. That's, it's a practice. It's a discipline. It's a skill and it can be developed.
[00:13:02] You, you had also said something that I, a couple of things that I thought were really significant.
[00:13:06] So I just want to step on these a little bit because after 550 episodes, I've really yet to, there were a couple of things you said that I really want to.
[00:13:14] Really, sort of highlight because it's, it's unique to you.
[00:13:18] Number one, you said something that I thought was, was very, very powerful.
[00:13:21] You talked about in post or syndrome. Every young REALTOR or rather every new REALTOR, I should say.
[00:13:27] You don't have to be young to be a REALTOR. Of course, every new REALTOR goes through this.
[00:13:31] Especially when they get their first listing and their first buyer or even their first hand.
[00:13:35] They're going to necess, you know, they don't know everything. Of course, they may be out on their own, not in a group.
[00:13:40] And they may feel that way. What Michael said was something very, very subtle.
[00:13:45] It was a nuanced point, but it was a good one. And he was really talking about mindfulness.
[00:13:50] What he was saying was once he acknowledged, once he recognized what the syndrome was in his case in post or syndrome, by the way, very common.
[00:13:58] And I have it. I have it as a podcast host after five years. I still think like why would anyone listen to me?
[00:14:07] But me too, me too. And maybe it never goes away. And that's okay.
[00:14:11] Because as long as I can acknowledge, for example, I have an event I'm going to tonight at seven o'clock.
[00:14:17] I have to get dressed up. It's this fancy, whatever. And I don't know anybody there.
[00:14:21] I will literally not know one person. Well, I will know one person, but I probably won't even see this person.
[00:14:25] So I'm going blind. I know it about six p.m. tonight. My brain is going to go don't go. Stay at home.
[00:14:32] Play on the couch. Play with the cats. I just know that's what's going to happen.
[00:14:36] Now, since I know that's going to happen, I can be mindful of it.
[00:14:40] And then I have a strategy to overcome that so I could actually go to the event tonight because it's actually a good thing, a healthy thing for me to go do tonight.
[00:14:47] So you said this. And again, I know this seems maybe not as well related to real estate practice, but you know, understanding one's self and understanding these tendencies that we all have these urges or these thoughts that are maybe not super helpful.
[00:15:01] It's okay. We don't have to necessarily fix them as long as we can acknowledge them. And then as Michael said, you know, just create other skills to compensate for that.
[00:15:11] So I just wanted to honor you for saying that because I look at the fact that you say you still feel feel that from time to time is so human and honest. So thank you.
[00:15:19] The other thing I wanted to to mention. Well, now I've gotten lost myself, but it was, you know, what we'll get to it a little bit further on.
[00:15:29] I really want to dive into this book because I have, we've had a lot of authors on this show, a lot of agents who write books for various reasons.
[00:15:39] And yours is really a cool idea that I think should resonate not only with the brokerage community and all the people who listen, but maybe a consideration to provide this even to their clients.
[00:15:51] So the book is called seller mistakes. Tell us about it. What what is the book? Why do you write it?
[00:16:00] There's a copy of the book is that's what it looks like yellow book.
[00:16:04] Well, first off, the working title, which my publisher hated was called high level fiduciary sales because I work with a lot of attorneys. And I thought that would resonate.
[00:16:16] The publisher thought it sucked just plain out sucked. So we work that. So for me, I realize that most sellers, if they're going to pick you, if they're going to hire you, then you want to sound different.
[00:16:33] You want it in, and I know we're all trained the same way. And oftentimes when I go into a listening presentation, sometimes they'll interview 10 agents.
[00:16:43] Usually when I get hired, they always say the same thing. You are so much different because everybody else said the same thing.
[00:16:52] And everything I say is actually in the book. So the book kind of is my listening presentation. I guess you could say that.
[00:16:59] But so for me, I just I was I was continually told and I think everybody else's told that there's there's certain things you should be doing to sell a house.
[00:17:11] You need to advertise in the news paper. You need a real estate sign out there. You need you need to do open houses. All that other stuff.
[00:17:20] And I found out that the National Association of Rilters puts out a questionnaire to I think it's 160,000 people every year that just bought a house.
[00:17:30] And they ask them 135 questions. And over time, it was it was 100 questions out like 135 questions. And they asked them a whole slew of information.
[00:17:39] And all these questions. And if if you return it, then they send you coupons for all this stuff. So it's and it is really the preeminent and only real true survey, the real estate survey that's out there, the National Association of Rilters puts it out every year.
[00:17:54] And it costs you like 25 bucks or you can get the free version. And it's like 10 pages. And so I love data. And what I was reading in that was completely different than what I was being told by the industry.
[00:18:08] And I was really happy to say to sellers if that makes sense.
[00:18:14] I'll give you an example. My broker, every broker I've been I've been with all said the same thing. You need to do open houses, open houses, sell houses. But I mean, look, I should have preempted all of this by saying, if you're real estate agent, you're probably going to hate what I have to say.
[00:18:31] You're going to hate a lot of the stuff. I have to say, but I want you to know something. It's not my opinion. This is from surveys. So this whole and in the book, I was hoping to sell a few hundred copies and sold 40,000 copies.
[00:18:45] All of a sudden I get a phone call from the publisher saying you hit the Wall Street Journal best seller list number three. This is back. This has been two years now.
[00:18:53] But to go back to open houses as an example, the National Association of Rilters does not ask brand new buyers if you bought your house because you found it on an open house.
[00:19:07] Oh, you wonder why the reason why is the percentage of people that bought a house because they went through it on an open house is so low.
[00:19:16] And what they do is in the industry, everybody kind of knows that open houses have an 8% chance of selling the house. But get this. If you read the question, the question says, and I detail this in the book, the question says, did you find your house because of an open house sign of billboard, any kind of sign.
[00:19:34] This includes data, I'm sorry, not data, but this includes data for new construction, new construction, they're open all the time. So about 10% of the national stock is new construction. So they lop all of that in and it is 8% but like I said, they don't ask really, you know, they don't ask this the finite question. And it's probably, and nobody really knows it, but it's probably between two and four percent.
[00:19:59] So, so you got two and four percent there. Look, how about the real estate sign? The real estate sign is really important. The brand wants the sign out there. You have a less than 1% chance of selling your house because of the real estate sign.
[00:20:13] Right.
[00:20:14] Print ads and mailers. That's one less than 1% to. So if you're an agent, your broker is telling you to do open houses, do print print mailers and have the real estate sign that probably accounts for maybe five or six percent of the effective.
[00:20:29] So, I'm going to give you a little bit more of the effectiveness of selling your house. I kind of thought, well, I'm going to dig into all this data and learn a little bit more. And what for me, what I was looking at, I started doing a white paper and a white paper is kind of like a research paper and I started writing and I was.
[00:20:44] And it's loaded with data because I love data and the book is full of data. It's not a lot of some of it's my opinion, but the vast majority of us is really is hard data and it's all attributed to where it came from.
[00:21:00] And I started writing this white paper and I went to a seminar. I love seminars. But I want to seminar on writing a book. I kind of thought, well, I'll look into this thing.
[00:21:12] And after the seminar, I approached the publisher. I said, this is my idea. And he said to be a fantastic idea. So it took me five years to write this book.
[00:21:24] Look, every REALTOR has a little bit of ADD. We're busy. And I'll tell you it's tough. It's really tough to write a book. If anybody here is ever written a book, what do you look at it pulling out a book?
[00:21:37] No, I am, I forgot to take a, ignore me. I'm just taking that.
[00:21:42] That's right. But so it took me five years. I was hoping to sell a few hundred copies. And like I said, in the first three months, it sold almost 35,000 copies. And it's still selling.
[00:21:56] And a lot of a lot of the people that are buying our real estate real estate folks, there was a commercial real estate brokerage in Pasadena. The manager called me. We had coffee two months ago. And he wanted a box of books that were signed by me and he bought them from me and he's given it to all of his sales agents.
[00:22:14] So I think this would be, you know, this book is actually really intended for a home seller and primarily a seller who's gone through the process before. So they kind of they get it. They understand the first time home seller may not really quite understand the nuances and the difficulties and the challenges and mistakes because they haven't done it yet.
[00:22:40] But it also, it's a great tool for a, anybody across the country, if you wanted to buy it and use it for your listening presentation, I think it would, it would be great.
[00:22:52] And some of the, some of the items in there isn't that like I said, your REALTORS may not like this, but like dual agency.
[00:23:00] You know what, I get a lot of business because I bring up dual agency within the, yeah, let's, let's talk about dual agency. I love it.
[00:23:09] We all know that dual agency now, it's not always bad. I get it. I know people are going to, I have some bad reviews on Amazon and they're from REALTORS. They don't believe in this.
[00:23:20] But I think we could all agree that dual agency primarily almost always benefits the buyer and the real estate agent.
[00:23:29] It really, really benefits the seller yet. Okay, I think that's a fair statement, right?
[00:23:34] Yep, agreed.
[00:23:37] However, if you're in a listening presentation and you show up to some, to a seller, I think what I do is sellers want to see how different you are.
[00:23:47] I tell them I write out the gate. I said, I tell them I want to let you know how different I am. I won't represent a buyer on this transaction.
[00:23:56] I believe that dual agency is the scourge of our industry. And I go and some of them don't understand dual agency and some of them think that it's good if I have my own buyer.
[00:24:05] So I'll go into it. And then what I'll do is I'll tell them whoever you interview and I think you should interview multiple agents.
[00:24:12] But that agent should bring it up and that agent should bring it up in the first few minutes of the presentation.
[00:24:18] That's how important you shouldn't have to ask. And if you have to ask about it, then they know that it's important and then they know that they can't, you know, they really shouldn't be doing it.
[00:24:27] I think you should be preempted and tell them right up front. It's going to make you look better. It's going to make you make them realize you're a real true fiduciary and you really off their back.
[00:24:38] I'm a huge fan and thank you for all of this. This is such great stuff. I want to.
[00:24:44] I thought you may hate it.
[00:24:46] No, I like it because it makes perfect sense to me.
[00:24:50] Thank you. And I have a couple of thoughts. So first, I want to go back to open houses just for a second because here's what I heard.
[00:24:58] And here's what I see as an opportunity and I want you to tell me if you agree or correct maybe in a way because you're out there and the trench is actually doing it.
[00:25:06] But what I heard I'm I'm I'm I'm our marketing guy or our company. So I'm always thinking with my marketing hat.
[00:25:12] And what I heard by saying, you know, open houses.
[00:25:15] This is again, a huge part of a listing presentation. Here's all the cool stuff I'm going to do for you.
[00:25:20] Mr. Mrs. Seller. I'm going to do open houses. I'm going to put a sign up. I'm going to have flyers.
[00:25:24] We're going to paper the neighborhood. We're going to get this out on every website on the planet.
[00:25:29] And but open houses specifically.
[00:25:31] I think it's a huge opportunity to say, let me tell you what open houses actually do. Mr.
[00:25:37] or Mrs. Seller. They're great for me. And here's why they're great for me.
[00:25:41] And they're great for, you know, and maybe other agents in my office who might be with me on the open house because it's a lead generator for me.
[00:25:48] I get to have all these buyers come in. Maybe some of them are unrepresented. I get to walk out with all this new business.
[00:25:54] Is it actually going to help you sell your home? Well, let me show you the data. The data says probably not.
[00:26:00] And so I'm happy to do them because I've always wanted to grow my business.
[00:26:04] But I don't want to do to do these with the with the expectation that you think it's actually going to help move your home.
[00:26:11] Here's what I'm here's what the data says will actually get your home sold.
[00:26:15] Even just saying that to me separates you from a lot of other agents curious to get your thought.
[00:26:21] Oh, absolutely. I mean, I talk to sellers all the time to say I'm going to do what's most effective.
[00:26:27] What's most effective is obviously great marketing being on the multiple listing service.
[00:26:32] All the other portals, great photos, great description.
[00:26:35] An agent that's going to pick up the phone. I mean, this is one of the things I tell them.
[00:26:39] Have your friends call me. And if I don't call them back within two hours, you can fire me.
[00:26:43] I love that. I mean, you ought to be able to return a phone call in two hours, right?
[00:26:48] Absolutely. Yeah, it's, but we've all been there when we call the listing agent or in the buyer's side.
[00:26:53] And they don't call you back or they don't call you back for two days or something like that.
[00:26:57] It's frustrating. But you know, the biggest complaint that people have and probably REALTORS do in real estate is communication.
[00:27:04] Lack of communication. Yeah. Yeah.
[00:27:07] Yeah. I once, I once had on one of the very top agents here in Chicago and I asked her, I go, what do you think it is that you do differently?
[00:27:16] And I know that this isn't a complete answer, but it was the first answer she said. And when I pressed her, she goes, no, that's pretty much it.
[00:27:23] This is, this is a crazy thing to say because it sounds so obvious.
[00:27:27] But I've yet to hear very many other agents say this except for top producers like yourself who do this.
[00:27:32] She says, I call every one of my clients every week and I give them an update on what's going on because I don't want them to have to call me to find out what's happening with the home that's for sale or the home I'm trying to put it off or on or whatever.
[00:27:45] She, and I said, okay, well, yeah, everyone does that. She goes, no, everybody does not do that.
[00:27:50] And that, and that was her sort of like, that's what I do. And I go, that is shocking that it is that the bar could be that low to clear because it seems like such an easy thing to do.
[00:28:00] I tell people I call them by Friday, even if I have no update, I'm just going to let them know there's no update.
[00:28:06] And then I think we all have these programs where we can send the market updates so they know how many clicks and stuff like that.
[00:28:11] But yeah, you got to, you got a column and you know, if you don't call them on a Friday by Friday evening, they're going to be bugging you over the weekend.
[00:28:18] And they're going to be pissed. So you may as well pick up the phone and just call them.
[00:28:22] I mean, I'm here from you.
[00:28:24] Of course, yeah. And, and we're, we're comp, well, I guess that's a different conversation, a compensation, but, but we are real estate professionals are compensated quite nicely for this service.
[00:28:36] And, you know, putting a home on the MLS is, I mean, anyone could really do that.
[00:28:41] But being in communication and constant communication, they're paying really for expertise. They're paying for customer service. They're paying for guidance.
[00:28:48] And, and that's where, where your value comes in. I have a question though. Let's say you get a text at 10 p.m. And you're done for the day, you're maybe spending time with, with friends or family.
[00:29:00] Are you, do you tell them, hey, you know, what do you do in that scenario? Are you, are you still responding or are you going, I've already told them that my hours are this and this and I'll get to them next morning.
[00:29:09] You know, what are your boundaries around that?
[00:29:13] I may be able to agree with this. I mean, no one's dying in real estate. It could wait to the next day.
[00:29:17] I mean, there's, it's not like medical emergency usually.
[00:29:22] Usually, I, I try to set the parameters when, you know, you start getting to know people and you start being friendly with them.
[00:29:29] But I don't tell them right up front, but after they've signed the listing, I go, hey, by the way, I just want to let you know I've got two kids. I've got a wife.
[00:29:35] I like to sit down for dinner every night. If, you know, if you text me, I will respond, but it might be as late as 9 o'clock because I do stuff with the boys with your boys, scouts and blah, blah, blah.
[00:29:46] I think if you, you tell them that you will respond and it's easier to take with the text that, you know, most everybody's great.
[00:29:54] I mean, sometimes we do have monster clients that are just, you can, you can never make them happy and guy, you can't wait to sell those things or just let them expire and walk away, right?
[00:30:03] But it's part of the business. But most people, if you just tell them that, like, I will respond.
[00:30:10] They're cool. Or they'll just say, you know what? Probably nothing will, you know, is that important?
[00:30:15] Well, it can just wait till the next day. But I did tell people that text is great for me. It's, if it's great for you, great.
[00:30:22] But I think one of the things you should ask for clients is to, is how do you like to be communicated with 100%?
[00:30:28] Do you like email? Do you like, to phone call? Do you like text? Because if you have an older client and you're texting them, you might know that you're just pissing them off.
[00:30:38] You know, because they just, this is not for them. So you've got to ask.
[00:30:42] Yeah, I have a little pro tip to throw on top of that. So asking Michael is such a smart thing.
[00:30:49] How do you prefer to be communicated with? And then I had, I heard it, I only heard it one agent ever say this, but I think this is such a cool thing.
[00:30:56] If you're working with clients who have different religious affiliations or maybe from different cultures, different ethnicities, and they may have special days that they do not work.
[00:31:08] So that's also a nice thing or maybe certain holidays that they want respected. And they might not want to hear from you on those days.
[00:31:15] So that's another great question is, hey, are there any days that you observe where you don't want me contacting you?
[00:31:20] And again, all of this just demonstrates that you care about the person that you care enough to ask and you're care enough to want to be the, you know, in doing it their way.
[00:31:30] But I want to go back to listing presentations because you are clearly the king of listing presentations.
[00:31:35] You wrote a book that essentially is a listing presentation, which every one of our listeners needs to read.
[00:31:41] I mean, 40,000 people have already bought it. It's clearly a good book. It's got great reviews. And I can't wait to dig in.
[00:31:47] But I would also like to know, you know, you said, hey, this is why I don't do dual agency. I love that within the first few minutes.
[00:31:52] Here's what dual agency is. Here's why I think it's the surge of the business. And let me explain, let me sort of explain the math about why as a fiduciary, it doesn't really make a lot of sense for me to do that because my job is to protect you and et cetera.
[00:32:05] And you have data to suggest that dual agency doesn't benefit the list or the seller.
[00:32:11] So would love to know what else you, you may do in a listing presentation that differentiates yourself.
[00:32:18] I actually tell people they should interview a few agents. So, so the national stats, 75% of all home sellers interview one agent.
[00:32:28] 10% of them interview three or more. And then the crazy thing is that 75% of all home sellers never use that same agent again.
[00:32:37] That they won the hiring. So you got to wonder why there's a lot of reasons why I mean one of the one of the amazing stats from the National Association of Realters, they say that 85% of all agents will be out of the 85% of all new agents will be out of the business within the first five years.
[00:32:56] So if you're, you know, if you're talking to a seller and you're asking them, hey, who are you interviewing? And then you can say, by the way, just so you know the stat, it's a crazy stat.
[00:33:09] But the National Association of Realters says that if you're hiring somebody that's only been in the business up to five years, it's an 85% chance that they're going to be out of the business. So you could be hiring a loser.
[00:33:21] Or that's not a need. I shouldn't say that, but you do have to be careful, you know, in this business, I mean, experience is really, excuse me, in this business experience is really important.
[00:33:32] Are you just look at the scoreboard? I mean, do you want to work with somebody who's winning all the time or somebody who's trying to win?
[00:33:38] Yeah, absolutely, absolutely. That's a really, really great point. And we should also mention too that Michael really plays it in a pretty exclusive sandbox with his listings and his clients.
[00:33:53] You know, I was prusing some of your listings. It was not uncommon to see listings in the mega million sort of range. I know your average home sale is well over is right around two million or so. And you go up from there.
[00:34:08] And so these I'm curious if you did you always play in the in the luxury or the high net worth space or were you did you sort of eventually graduate to those types of clients.
[00:34:19] So I know where you're going with this because everybody wants to if you want to make more money and real estate the easiest way to do it is to go to a higher price point.
[00:34:28] And when you when you get to those higher price point ones, I think it's important to market yourself a lot more.
[00:34:35] And I mean, you know, you should be doing everything you can to sell that house, but do more stuff that's probably not necessarily going to help the seller, but you yourself.
[00:34:44] Do more social media do better photos do you know a little bit more a little bit more promotion.
[00:34:50] And certainly, you know, all of that's going to help, but is it are those little things really going to be the the the difference maker to sell that house.
[00:35:00] Probably not. I mean, we all kind of know that if you're priced correctly and if you answer your phone and you have the right photos and you have a good description.
[00:35:08] You usually take care of itself. I mean, I think that's a fair assessment. People screw that up all the time.
[00:35:16] But but to answer your question, how did it it was part of it is obviously the market in Pasadena, the average sales price when I got into the business when I was flipping houses, the average sales price was probably might have been 300,000.
[00:35:32] And now the average sales price here in 2024 is easily a million six million five. So I had that benefit.
[00:35:42] But I think it's important like part of the thing that slowed me down as an agent is that that imposter syndrome.
[00:35:50] I always kind of feel like, Oh, I can't do that two million dollar thing. They'll never hire me.
[00:35:55] You just got to lean into it and and you know, even if you've got an intimidating listing coming up, just do it. Just do it for practice.
[00:36:03] I mean, frankly, I go on listing listing appointments that I have an idea. I have a pretty good idea. I'm never going to get because they have a family member or somebody or I was able to weasel my way in because they've already made a decision.
[00:36:17] They're going to hire someone so what they haven't signed the listing contract and I say, Hey, can you just give me a shot for 20 minutes?
[00:36:24] And they say basically yell, do it, but it's going to be a waste of time. So you know, that's a great opportunity. You should do it. You should absolutely do it.
[00:36:31] And you know what, even even more so get this, you should lean into it and just practice your your dialogues, practice the words that you, you know, you were so intimidated by, by say it.
[00:36:42] And just kind of forget that impostor syndrome and go for it because once in a while, you're going to nail it once in a while.
[00:36:48] You're going to get that listing, but you've got to lean into this stuff.
[00:36:51] Yeah, it's this willingness to willingness to lose and willingness to be wrong or willingness to do it imperfectly or just the willingness to it's just it's just trying right.
[00:37:04] And yes, the impostor syndrome comes up it it deflates us. It's hard for us to it's the it's the boulder we have to push up the hill every day, but, but it's it's a worthy effort.
[00:37:16] And if if you can, obviously, Michael is a perfect example, he is willing to not get a listing. He is willing to still go and he wants the opportunity and it's not fun to not get a listing, but it is also practice for the next listing.
[00:37:32] It's great. We should absolutely do it. We should absolutely do it. I mean, what I meant to say is it's called failing forward.
[00:37:40] That's important in your business is do you have to fail forward yet to keep going at it? Go on, go on wild, little bit of wild use chase is not too much.
[00:37:49] I mean, you know, you shouldn't be preparing for four or five hours for a listing presentation. You just shouldn't be there's a lot of easier ways of, but you should have a really good decent CMA package.
[00:38:01] You should have a really good little marketing package, something you can just email ahead of time. They may not look at it. So you show up with something that's bound with paper, but you should not be preparing for four or five hours. It's I think that's that that's ridiculous.
[00:38:14] Yeah, and you should just yeah analysis paralysis, I guess, but you should know exactly what you what you want to accomplish in that presentation.
[00:38:24] What you want to communicate and more most importantly, what information you're looking to extract, which means obviously, as you said at the beginning, listening, asking the right questions, being it's really the fastest way I've found to building relationships with people is getting interested in them.
[00:38:41] And this isn't anything new Dale Carnegie wrote about this in the early 1900s, how to win friends and influence people is basically just ask them about them. But it really is super important, especially as an agent, because you are fiduciary, you do need to act in their best financial interest, and you will only know how to do that if you ask a lot of questions in those buyer and seller presentations.
[00:39:03] So I could not could not agree with you more there, but I know the thing I forgot earlier, I know we're going back about 20 minutes, but but it relates to what you just said, the dialogue this idea that I was I was really impressed by your your brother, the the chiropractor who said, you know, I probably should learn what to say and what to ask in addition chiropractor is a very physical job, but it really doesn't require much speaking because what they're doing is, you know, hands on work.
[00:39:30] But yet he saw the value in that and he knows that it's critically important sort of how you say things what you say with respect to patient, you know, and professional.
[00:39:41] And this doesn't change as a REALTOR, right? You're the professional and you have clients and this idea of practicing dialogue is something that doesn't really get talked enough about, I think, in this industry.
[00:39:54] It's certainly something a good coach would have you do is role playing and memorizing, I mean, look, you know, we want to be able to go off script, but you need a script to be able to go off script, I think.
[00:40:06] Yeah, yeah.
[00:40:07] And so I love the fact that I know you you don't spend four to five hours preparing for a listing presentation, but you know exactly what you're wanting to accomplish in that listing presentation, because of course you've been successful.
[00:40:20] It doesn't just happen randomly because you showed up a bunch of times.
[00:40:23] You obviously have a very strong process and you wrote a book about it, which is which is again, seller mistakes.
[00:40:29] Tell us a little bit more about the book. So the book really goes into detail. It's it's your sort of listing presentation, by the way, how generous is Michael to write a book basically showcasing his entire process for the whole world to see.
[00:40:44] He he's not threatened by this. He's actually it was probably a real honor for him to be able to share that.
[00:40:50] So really encourage everyone to head over to Amazon, pick up the book, and I'm excited to read it, but tell us a little bit more about the book.
[00:40:59] So, um, God, there's so many things. I actually have a chapter about why it's wrong. It's it's a mistake to hire a friend or family member to sell your house.
[00:41:10] And oftentimes we're I think we're all confronted with this way going to listing presentation or you find out later that they're just hiring.
[00:41:17] They're using you for information and they're just going to tell their friend or family member to sell.
[00:41:23] So I kind of jump right into that when I'm talking with them and I ask them, are you interviewing other agents?
[00:41:29] I mean, by the way, you shouldn't be afraid to ask questions.
[00:41:32] Ask, you know, you want to find out what their motivation is, all this other stuff.
[00:41:36] But oftentimes I'll ask you can just ask them, am I competing with a friend or family member?
[00:41:41] And if they'll they usually will tell you or if they say, you know, I'm not really comfortable telling you that. Well, they just told me that's yes.
[00:41:50] But for example, on the friend and family issue, one of the things that I bring up is, you know, if you if you are hiring a friend or family member, I just want to throw something out at you.
[00:42:01] And they go, what? You know, because I like, you know, what could this role to be saying?
[00:42:05] I said, when you hire somebody like that, you leave, you're leaving the nuclear option off the table.
[00:42:11] And then they go, what's the nuclear option? The nuclear option is that you can't yell at them and you can't fire them because you're going to ruin a family relationship or a friendship.
[00:42:19] And it's not worth it. And to see this all the time, you shouldn't do business with people with your friends or family members.
[00:42:25] Look, you can hire me, you can fire me, you can yell at me, you can blast me, you can ignore me, you can be rude to me, you can't do that with the other people.
[00:42:35] There's a lot to be said about having a business relationship with somebody. And oftentimes they'll be like, oh my god, you're right.
[00:42:42] And then they'll talk about how, you know, everybody has stories about a relationship that went sour because you went into business with that person.
[00:42:50] But I think it's important to kind of throw that out there while you're talking with somebody, maybe over the phone or when you're getting there, but one of that I want to backtrack a little bit what I said about motivation, you know, only motivated people by or sell real estate.
[00:43:06] Okay, right. We all agree with that. Okay. So it's important to figure out their motivation.
[00:43:12] One of the questions I ask, oh, home sellers is even on the phone, if I get a phone call from somebody and I'll just say, hey, I have a few questions for you.
[00:43:21] Imagine I just sold your house, you're super happy with me and all that other good stuff. Where do you sleep tonight?
[00:43:28] Leave it like that. Where do you sleep tonight? If you have the answer, the, if the answer is, I don't know, I'll just figure that out later. I'm just looking, and then they'll tell you I'm just looking for the best price and I'll figure it out later.
[00:43:39] Well, you've got yourself an unmotivated seller. You need to be careful.
[00:43:44] So that's one of the most important questions to ask somebody. And I would do that on the phone call when they, when they call you.
[00:43:52] And then at least you know where you're standing. And if you decide you want to move forward with an interview, great, but at least you know that, you know, they're probably going to just waste your time.
[00:44:02] That's a, you know, that is an amazing tip. You're kind of blowing my mind right now because it, I've never really heard that specific question before.
[00:44:10] It's a brilliant question because it does sort of give you insight into how much they've thought about this and how they're looking, you're right.
[00:44:19] And they might just be in that preliminary stage of looking, which, which is fine. If you know that as the agent and you're like, okay, well, I know this is a 12 to 16 month sort of thing.
[00:44:29] Okay, well, I'll just build the relationship now. But at least I know kind of where they're at. And so that they, so if I'm okay with them wasting my time, at least I can make that decision as the agent versus finding out down the road that they've been wasting my time.
[00:44:42] Well, so get this. This goes back to the stats. It's kind of boring, but it's, it's important to say the National Association of Rilters asked that question, why did you sell your house?
[00:44:51] The top 10 reasons why people are selling their house are their life events, divorce, job, whatever, downsize, upside blah, blah, blah.
[00:45:02] It's not in the top 10 or in the top 30 or the top 100, it is not, oh, if I just get my price, I'll move. That's why that's not why people sell to get just to get their price.
[00:45:13] So you got to jump on that.
[00:45:16] That's a really, really good point. So boy, that's a, that is a great point, Michael. I really appreciate that.
[00:45:23] Again, these are the kind of things that are in the book, everyone. And Michael does a deep dive into, and you know, he, he mentioned at the beginning of this conversation that the National Association of Rilters does this study every year.
[00:45:33] And it is fascinating. And I really, it's worth the $25 if you don't have the 25, as Michael said, read the free version, because you're going to find out at the very least, why, how people choose their REALTOR, and or at least the statistics of what is most likely going to be the motivators for people to choose their agent.
[00:45:53] And what's interesting to me is, you know, for 20 years, I've been hearing that technology is ultimately going to replace the agent because the agent won't be as significant.
[00:46:05] Because if we looked at, you know, the, the, what agents did, a lot of the focus was on access to MLS. Of course, we know that everyone has access now. So that's not, not necessary.
[00:46:17] You're the value really comes in in many other ways, everything other, necessarily, then maybe just the home selection, because of course people can really do that on their own largely.
[00:46:28] But then they're going to look to you for all of the, and again, I think this too is part of the presentation when you talk to a buyer or seller.
[00:46:37] Here's how I earn my fee or my service. This is actually what I do for you. This is, you know, here's the data to support it. And here's why, why it's significant.
[00:46:48] You want to hear something crazy. In the last 20 years, according to the National Association of REALTORS, a little over 20 years ago, which is, you know, or it was more like 30 years ago, the sellers said that they value, they highly value the help of a real estate agent.
[00:47:06] It was in the high 70s. And then we had the internet and all this boom and all these, you know, great, you know, advances. And it is, it has gone up an average of almost 1% and it's almost 90%.
[00:47:21] And the reason why people actually, I mean, everybody says we're going by by actually consumers want us even more.
[00:47:27] And because it's just so complicated, so difficult, they're so busy. They just don't hit people. I mean, in California, our purchase agreement is being revised again.
[00:47:39] It's been revised every six months for the last five years. Our listing form is going to be completely revised. There's, I mean, there's so many new forms and stuff like that.
[00:47:49] Well, I don't think we're going to go by by and there are certain forms you need and certain forms you really shouldn't have, but you could use, but if you use them, you're kind of not practicing it correctly.
[00:47:59] And if an attorney gets a hold of that, they can show a pattern of you not understanding the process. And it's just like, why would a, why would a consumer not want a real estate agent?
[00:48:10] But, you know, it's not my opinion. Those are the stats.
[00:48:14] Yeah, and very encouraging statistics. I think here in Chicago last year, 95% of all residential transactions went through a REALTOR, which was actually up from previous years, you know, a half percent or here and there.
[00:48:28] But it's not going down, which is a good good thing for people in the industry like everyone listening and myself as well, and Michael, but really showcasing the value of what REALTORS provide that even though what MLS used to be under lock and key.
[00:48:42] It is not under lock and key anymore and more changes are coming, of course, as we're all following, but it has not been under lock and key for quite some time. Zillow essentially blew that out of the water.
[00:48:52] And we still are as important. In fact, more important now because it's such a large financial transaction. I just went through it myself maybe three years ago.
[00:49:01] And I was, I'm curious to get your thoughts on this. I, well, I'm not a practicing agent. So this was a little bit easier for me to do, but I did not represent myself. I had my boss represent me because number one, he did it for free. He's a guy, he's my employer is a good guy.
[00:49:14] But also because I was way too emotional and I knew I was going to I was in distress. I was like, I don't know I was I wasn't thinking clearly I couldn't be objective. And as a result, I had somebody else do it for me, but I thought that was a smart play for me because I was not able to see my own my own deal clearly because I know it was so much money.
[00:49:37] I was I saved up for years and I was putting this big down payment down and I was terrified.
[00:49:43] I think we all have blind spots. I sold a house one of my own homes about two years ago during COVID. It was just a great time for me to sell this one property and I hired an agent in our office. I paid her a full commission.
[00:49:55] And I was surprised at the blind spots that I had just because I was emotionally involved and I don't know I was kind of surprised the blind spots like I said that I had and I'm really happy I hired her and I made a lot more money than I thought and was more smoother.
[00:50:12] And but yeah, there you go. I mean, we all have blind spots.
[00:50:17] Yeah, and it's also a good thing to remember that this is what our clients go through, right? This is what you know and as agents, this is our value that we can help reduce that stress.
[00:50:27] We can help or at least tackle the stress or say, hey, I'm taking it off your plate onto my plate as your professional. I'm going to take care of this. I'm on I'm on it.
[00:50:37] So you don't have to be as freaked out. So I'm a huge huge fan of that. I have one question. So actually, I have lots of questions. But well, I have this one question I've been wanting to ask you.
[00:50:47] So we know right now it is it's a difficult time, I think, to be a REALTOR. Certainly brokerage production is although it seems to be getting better. So that's exciting.
[00:50:56] But certainly last year was a tough year for most agents, most brokerages and you know rates were high inventory was low.
[00:51:05] What advice might you have to somebody who's listening who maybe isn't flush with clients right now right now they're going well my buyers want to wait for rates to come down the fed.
[00:51:17] So they're going to cut rates three more times this year inventories low. I can't seem to get anybody to list. What might you suggest is just ways to stay busy and keep active.
[00:51:29] That's a great question because it's a question I asked myself last year last year I had three months period where nothing happened and I had a great year. I would I outsold everybody in this office.
[00:51:39] But it was three months and it was scary. And so what I did was I'm going to plug another book and it's an old book. It's called the seven levels of communication from Michael mayor.
[00:51:52] And I used to be a Keller Williams and Keller Williams for their mega camps would always promote an author. And I thought I think this point one of the best books that a REALTOR can read.
[00:52:02] And I'll save you all I'll save you the money and I'll tell you the story the story is about it down and out loan officer that can't get things going. He doesn't understand why everybody else is more successful.
[00:52:12] And he goes to the seminar and learns and this is how the principles of the book are taught. And what he learns is that you need to be influential.
[00:52:22] And there's different levels of being influential and there's different levels how you communicate that that's the seven levels.
[00:52:31] And there's a line. Imagine a line here and everything you do below this line is not influential and everything above this line is influential.
[00:52:41] There's four things that are very influential that you can do in real estate sales. And I think I guess it would probably apply to almost any other sale.
[00:52:50] The number one thing you can do is seminars. So if you can think like I'm doing I do seminars on my book. I have people come over. It's a dinner event. I buy them dinner. I bring dinner in. They're in my office. I give a market update.
[00:53:04] I chat about the pitfalls of selling your house. I take question and answers. And then I do a book signing. And then every time I do that I get four phenomenal leads, four or five phenomenal listing leads. I want by the way I'm mostly a listing agent.
[00:53:22] I don't go for the buyers. I have buyer transactions, but 90% of my sales are listings. So seminars. And you can do that with buyer seminars too. It's easy. It's not that hard to do all of this.
[00:53:34] The next thing you can do is what's called face to face. And face to face is going to be lunches or dinners. But you got to get face to face with people. The next level is voice to voice.
[00:53:45] You know everybody can you can pick up the phone and just dial for dollars. That's influential. And the next thing below that is handwritten letters. And in his book he actually talks about how to write a letter. What kind of letter had you used? What kind of form you know you don't want to brand it with your real estate company.
[00:54:02] There's a lot of little nuances. Then you have this line. And below that is uninfluential stuff. And guess what's under there? It's emails, social media, mailers, door hangers.
[00:54:19] And that's all the lazy stuff that REALTORS do because it's normal for anybody to hide behind all that stuff. A behind hide behind everything and just kind of do all of that stuff.
[00:54:29] But I think any top producer is going to that's going to be listening to this is is probably going to acknowledge that voice to voice face to face and seminars are fantastic. And I know that there's REALTORS out there that get a lot of business from Facebook. And that's fine. But if you're going to do Facebook, I mean you need to nail it.
[00:54:44] Oh, you need to nail it and you need to be doing it probably every day.
[00:54:49] Two hours a day. And yeah. So you know, if you that's why we talked about off this off air. I don't really I don't have a lot of social media stuff. I mean I have a little Facebook business page. I have a little YouTube channel.
[00:55:02] But I don't get any leads from it and sure it's a hole in my business. I could be doing something better. But I'd rather not I'd rather I like to do face to face and seminars. That's that's my thing. And you know the national association of REALTORS.
[00:55:17] They they they survey people on why they hired a certain real estate agent 75% of that decision is because they they like you and they trust you.
[00:55:28] Okay, hello. Get out there. Have lunch with people. You don't have to have expensive lunches. Grab breakfast, grab coffee, grab dinner. You know easy. Do the same thing with attorneys.
[00:55:41] You know, CPAs those are where you referral sources. If they like you and they can remember you. I mean this business is so simple. It's hard.
[00:55:51] I know. I love that. You just you just got me on that one. It's so simple. It's it's hard. It's it's and it is hard. But it is simple. Right. It's like put it's like a push up. It's hard. But it's simple and it's effective. And so what you're really talking about how I heard that is influential activities are interpersonal meaning we are we are interacting with another human being either in person over the phone.
[00:56:18] Or you know via a handwritten note or or something something to that effect. But but or you know we're either sitting with them. We're talking with them or we're writing them. And you know just go back to handwritten notes for a second. I mean Brian Biffini built a whole career not this is reducing him to just one thing which is not fair because he's a he's a great he's a great coach.
[00:56:39] But one of his big tenants is handwritten notes and he's not wrong. And in fact nobody does them at all anymore. So the idea of even doing a handwritten note in and of itself is going to separate you and I like the idea of not using company letterhead you know get get your own stationary or just do some you know way and we'll we'll plug that the seven levels of communication books so people can learn exactly sort of the the thoughts behind how to do this but
[00:57:03] interpersonal communication is is is the way and I'll tell you one of the top agents in Chicago I asked her what she's doing this year. And she's goes you know I have a lot of people she's been doing this 20 plus years I love to get your your opinion on this is speaking of interpersonal is she has of course people as they retire they move out of Chicago and Illinois and go somewhere warm.
[00:57:24] And a lot of times that's Florida or Texas or Arizona or wherever it may be and she refers business all over the place and she goes you know I've never visited any of these other agents so she flies now she flies down she interviews three or four different agents she hangs out with them for a day or so to really understand what do they do how do they do it.
[00:57:44] And I said boy that is a brilliant strategy because of course hopefully some leads will come her way as she's providing leads but she goes no these are my clients I have to make sure that as I'm referring this out to somebody in Boca Raton or wherever that they are as good as I am because I just can't look at Zillow and go well this is the person with the best number of reviews I mean yeah that's that's a start but she goes I need to meet this person face to face I want to see how they interact with their clients and I thought boy that what a smart strategy.
[00:58:15] Yeah that's great and I think for a newer agent you had asked about this you know what do you do it's easy for a new agent I think to feel like a fire hose is hit your mouth yeah it's really hard to swallow and so I've always there's two things I've always told agents one eight one one I haven't said this in a while but it's really important you should only listen to people that are making a lot of money.
[00:58:40] That's true yes.
[00:58:42] Does everybody's going to give you opinions when you get into the business oh I used to do this I used to do that and this is how it works and it's like well if they're not okay if you want to make a million dollars in real estate talk to people that are making a million dollars in real estate sorry don't listen to anybody else you know but the other thing I think is really important and I learned this when I was at Keller Williams and I think the world of Keller Williams and the education stuff that they have but you should what I learned from there is you should
[00:59:10] do three things and do them really well don't do more than three things it's just too hard to do so if you're going to do seminars great you're going to do social media great but just but don't don't feel like you have to do 10 things because you spread yourself too thin you're not doing it very well and the consumer is going to figure that out really quick and you're not going to get any business.
[00:59:30] Yeah Jack of all trades master of none so you want to be a master so master 3 yeah I I'd read that in many many business books years ago just in a day like running the business here it's like do like I'm really good at like 3 to 4 things tops maybe 5 maybe but really probably 3 and so I also think too you know being able to say to doing your listing presentations you know this is what I do this is my
[00:59:58] business is what I do well here's the data to back that up I love the one thing you said I just want to go back to this because it is is really a powerful thing I encourage you Mr.
[01:00:09] and Mrs. Teller to explore other agents before making a decision what what why would someone say that well to me it demonstrates a really high level of value to because you are actually
[01:00:24] saying something that is in their best interest and I think that is a real demonstration of character and the willingness to say your needs are more important than mine which is really a significant message that I'm assuming most agents aren't going to communicate in that listing presentation I love that you say I'd encourage you to talk to others well you're not really let in the wolf into the
[01:00:49] hells because chances are they're not going to let the wolf and they're not going to do it I just right you're giving them good advice and they really should do it once in a while I have that happened and then they call me a few weeks later they're like I actually took your
[01:01:01] advice I interviewed three other agents what a waste of my time you look make you look better not be like well either way it's going to make you look good because whether or not you even get the thing they're going to remember that you were so honest and so helpful that even if you know it's that sort of
[01:01:19] almost reciprocity thing that that principle of reciprocity where we do something for someone they feel in obligation to sort of return that favor but you're absolutely right it reminds me of the top when I was a financial advisor a million years ago the top agent or the top that financial
[01:01:35] advisor in our office million dollar way you know big big revenue producer he goes I'm going to tell you guys exactly what I do every day and none of you are going to do it so and you're right so by telling it you know the client hey this is what I really
[01:01:49] suggest you should do they're not going to do it but or I mean they might do it and that's in their best interest if they do if they don't they still look at you and go wow that person was willing to invite in the competition because that's how confident he is in his own services I think that's a powerful
[01:02:06] message it's also a said commentary about what you said is that we're sitting there I'm giving you all this I think is great advice I think this is the stuff that's made me over a million dollars a year
[01:02:17] but most people won't do it and I learned that years ago because I used to be very I used to keep everything close to the chest and I didn't want to share
[01:02:25] and because I thought I don't want somebody to get my ideas you know I tell everybody everything that I do it is very seldom this somebody I'm the only agent in our
[01:02:34] office that uses our office for networking events I do I just had one two nights ago we had 35 people here I invited a whole
[01:02:42] bunch of attorneys and it was cost me 600 bucks I had a group of 35 attorneys and CPAs in my office for $600
[01:02:51] I sorry that's a great deal and we just yep yeah no agenda no presentation I had some music going on I bought a bunch of booze I ordered three pizzas and I told them there's no agenda would you like to come over for a mixer it's from 6 to 8 boom I mean and they're in my turn they're on my turf
[01:03:11] I mean this is something I just started and I read the book 20 years ago I should have done this a long time ago but that's something anybody can do because you know if you think about it I couldn't take 35 attorneys and CPAs help to coffee for $600
[01:03:25] right now I got them all circulating and chitchatting is like this is gold I think I'm going to keep doing this stuff yeah and it's interpersonal and it's also of service to them because they do have clients they need to
[01:03:41] refer they do have these situa problems that you can help solve and vice versa of course your clients need a state planning attorneys they need divorce
[01:03:48] attorneys sometimes they need you know countenance and professional services and I love I love that that is that is a great you know we have a space here in our office I said earlier we have almost 800 agents you know how often one of our agents uses our space which by the way 24
[01:04:04] seven access we do not even like they can come in anytime three in the morning they can come in nobody ever uses it and and it which is a shame because you're absolutely right education in person education you know we're all sick of zoom meetings everyone let's remember that so yeah great good Michael I could talk to you all day but you're too busy to talk to me all day and I would like to
[01:04:27] really well that is we you have given us so much value in this really I really encourage everyone Michael said probably about 10 things that every one of our listeners could start doing or or adjust their strategy to consider to do a little bit differently
[01:04:46] and really well it was it was really amazing and all of this is also in his book seller mistakes again number top seller on Amazon number one actually on Amazon so I'm worried I have a link to that in the show notes please pick up the book consider also maybe sharing it with your clients this is a great maybe somebody who's not quite ready to sell but wants to get say hey I've got a book I want you to read so that you can get educated so that when you are ready you know boy I mean imagine doing that for sure
[01:05:16] somebody you we now have something to give them and it's a value will they read it who knows but they're going to see that you care enough about what their process is to actually help educate them and you the agent should read it too because you're going to learn exactly how Michael has done it for 20 plus years 25 plus years and he is really at the at the top of the mountain as far as production goes so why not just steal his ideas he put them all out there for you to take
[01:05:45] you can always call if you have a client that you're going to be interviewing for in a few weeks you can call him and say I'm going to send you a book it's from this crazy guy in Pasadena who wrote this book 40,000 people bought it it's the number three Wall Street Journal it's it's somebody who really nailed the principles down and I'm just going to send you the book and you can just you can go on Amazon's I think it's like 10 bucks for the soft cover if you want I'm not trying to sell book I'm trying to help you get some ideas but you can send it to them they'll read it because there's no other book out there like that
[01:06:15] and as long as you agree to those principles and the principles are not that big of a deal you're not going to do a dual agency you're not going to rely on open houses sure you can have a real estate song sure you're going to do mail or sure you're going to do all that stuff but you're it's it's really going to it's going to help you out it's going to make you look really smart too
[01:06:34] it will cut out the this was one of the things I do is when they read it the chapter about hiring friends and family members it's going to most likely it's going to get them to go forget this I'm not going to hire a friend or family member it's going to open up an opportunity for you there if there is an opportunity but that's that's just an idea you can send them out or I mean if you wanted to you can send it on my website and they can listen to the audio book for free you know that's kind of awkward of course but
[01:07:02] but you can also send them a digital copy I'm not sure how that works with with digital versions because they have to have a kindle for that sure well we will we will by the way Michael just said something very very generous so if anyone wants to listen to his audio book it is it is located it is for free on his website Michael B Bell dot com will have a link to that
[01:07:27] of yeah you don't have to sign in or anything like that it's just it's just free it's just generous as I've ever heard from an author so thank you Michael for that everyone please support Michael let him know how well he did on the show today let him know in particular not how well he performed but how well he assisted you in your business we really you know getting somebody like like a Michael and all of our guests it's it's these these are busy people with not a ton of time and Michael does not need to sell these books to survive he's doing this out of the goodness of his heart
[01:07:57] so thank you Michael on behalf of the audience for all your tips all your advice and for the book itself and also a free audio book guys I mean come on that that is that is incredible and I'm not trying to sell book I believe it or not if you're a self published author on Amazon they rip you off they just you don't really make that much money so no it's it's tough it's about to get the information out there and make hopefully make a positive change but I want to throw something out there also and I'd be a horrible real REALTOR if I didn't say this but if you have any
[01:08:27] needs in the Pasadena area I work Pasadena, Lachanada, San Marino, San Gabriel, Sierra Madre, Monrovia, Glendale, Burbank, Lachanada, Lacharcenta those areas I'm an expert in those areas if you have a need out there if you have a client if you if you just want to
[01:08:45] chit chat about stuff pick up the phone and call me and I'd love to talk to agents anybody if I can talk to you if you have if you have clients that move to those areas yeah Michael is the guy so please other agents consider building a relationship with Michael because he has clients that move out of those areas too and maybe you guys could you know become partners in that sense so if anyone out there is looking for a REALTOR in those areas of course Michael is the guy but even if you're an
[01:09:15] agent in a different state and city and if you have agents or clients that move there definitely consider connecting with Michael get this I love paying referral fees.
[01:09:25] Yeah I mean who I don't know anyone I can't imagine any you know referrals are such a missed opportunity in this industry and boy we could talk about that maybe I'll be when I maybe I'll have you back to do a whole thing on
[01:09:38] inner referrals because I think that's yeah well Michael thank you on behalf of the audience guys go to his website michaelbeel.com download the audio book by the hardcover book as well or an electronic copy please please send it to your your your perspective sellers these this is demonstrating value we know that the NAR says hey people you know agents sorry clients will hire agents they know like and trust what better way to demonstrate no like and trust by

But please do check out cellar mistakes. We're going to be chatting with Michael about that here right now. Michael, welcome to the show. Thank you DJ. I appreciate it. I appreciate, appreciate you and really all that you have done in the industry. It's really a remarkable career at least in my estimation. And I talk to people like you a lot or agents who are at your level. And I'm always just blown away by what you have built in particular and writing a book to give back, I think is really fantastic too. But I'd love to start at the beginning of the story. So you've been in real estate for quite some time. Tell us how you got in. Was this something you always wanted to do or do you fall into it or how did you how'd you get involved? Well, let's thank you for the introduction. It made me feel old. So well, I'm 54 years old. I started by buying houses and flipping them. And I couldn't find a good REALTOR to help me. I just I'm into the details and I just I couldn't even find one to get a real estate sign up on time or that wasn't crooked. So at the time my girlfriend said you should get your own license, get your broker's license and represent yourself and wow, what a phenomenal idea. So I started flipping homes representing myself. And then I had neighbors say, gosh, she did such a great job. Can you represent me? Can you sell my house for me? And I kind of thought, well, that's a great idea. And I got to I got to know a lot of the REALTOR is locally. They liked the way I performed what I did and how I did it. And I was I was young. I was in my 20s. And I was the I had I started my own brokerage. And I was the youngest practicing broker in Pasadena. And I hated it. We ever seen that super bowl commercial was years ago. It's for Yahoo. And it was these cowboys that are going over the over the planes. And they're trying to lasso of all things kitty cats. Yeah, I remember that. That was awesome. Wasn't it? And it was I that at that time when I saw that commercial, I thought to myself, I got to get out of this. I did not like managing people. I don't know how you do it. But I kind of felt like after after about 10 years of doing that, I'm better off in sales. I never thought I was a sales guy. I thought it'd be horrible. I thought it'd be a great manager. It's just it's the opposite. I want to be really good at sales. I've always taken kind of a different path, which we'll talk about in the book and how I try to differentiate myself in front of sellers. But I want to sell in the brokerage. And so I've been a practicing agent with one assistant for the last 18 years, something like that. It's it is interesting. You know, I sort of have a different path, but but a similar sort of realization. So I don't think fully you would not want me to manage our agents. We have almost 800 of them. And I would be the I would be a terrible manager because I need everybody to like me. And that makes me sort of by default, not a very objective manager. So thankfully, I realized in my role here that I was best at this one thing, which is in my case recruiting agents. And because when you need people to like you, you're probably decent at sales. And so I really consider myself on the sales side as well. So I can absolutely appreciate that. But I also also appreciate how hard it is to run a brokerage, especially now right now with, with of course, all the changes that that may or may not be coming everyone's way. But I would love to find out because even though you started, you know, decades ago, and I apologize. I'm not trying to make you feel old. You and I are not far apart, and age, by the way, we are very close in age. But I would like to know about being in your 20s and finding clientele because to me, that seems like a very difficult task. We have lots of people who are in their 20s who listen to the show and who may be struggling in that way. So I'm curious. You know, you were the youngest broker in Pasadena. You were very successful in your early days. Of course, you're still successful today. By the way, we should mention Michael is a point. So we said he's a point top point 1% producer. He's also with his company, Sotheby's a top point 3% producer worldwide with Sotheby's, which is obviously we know how what a white glove firm Sotheby's is. So you're obviously very accomplished. But how did you, how did you start building your business in your 20s? Was that difficult for you? It's tough. Look, I'm 54 and people say I look a lot younger or I look good for when I was in my 20s, I looked a lot younger too. There's a few things that actually I didn't expect this question. There's a thing out there called imposter syndrome. And if you're not aware of it, look it up. And I think it's very, at least for me was very natural. I kind of felt like I, in a way I was an imposter. Like how, how could I be selling, you know, back then, a $800,000 house or a million dollar house. I'm only 26 years old. And I felt like an imposter. I think part of getting over that is just to understand the syndrome, you know, just to really understand just when you identify the problem as now you can see it and now you can kind of develop tools to go over to overcome that. The other thing is, I think in anything in the world, anything you want to succeed in life, you got to lean into it and you have to be willing to fail. And I failed a lot. I screwed up a lot of listening presentations. But then I learned. And I learned what to say. And I learned certainly what not to say. And I learned how long you're supposed to talk and how long, you know, we have two years in one mouth. You know, you should be listening more than you're talking. But you and I can talk about all the little nuances of all of that, what you should be and should not be doing. But I felt like I learned that in the early age. And for me, also the other thing is I love education. I love learning. And I've always kind of realized that I would rather learn from the path of successful people than learn on my own. So I got into training. I have a coach. I'm coaching with Steve Scholl. I know everybody kind of knows that guy. He talks about tactical empathy and emotional intelligence. And if you don't know what I'm talking about, you need to go out and buy the book. And I think the book it's called never split the difference from boss. I forgot that first name. An absolute, an absolute game changer in how you talk with people and negotiate with people. But I think it's, you know, going, as my, what went through my journey, I always realized the people that were the most accessible were the ones that were trainable. And yeah, interesting. And if you don't have the money, I know the coaching is expensive real estate coaching with a company can, you know, like it. One of my old companies is either 500 bucks a month for a group coaching thing or it'd be like a thousand or 1500 bucks for a half hour every week. There's a lot of free stuff out there. I mean, you can go to. You can go to the other guy forgot. Fairy. Fairy. And fairy has so much stuff online that you, you know, you almost don't, you don't need to pay for any of it. But it's just, it's great free content. But I think if, you know, this real estate is a practice. It's a practice of real estate. We're all practicing. You should keep that practice and going. You need to learn all of the, you need to know, know what to say, what not to say. And, you know, it's one of the things I know I'm going off on tangents, but I've got a lot to say about this. My brother, my younger brother is a really successful chiropractor. And he's up in Portland and he sees about 150 people a day. Whoa. What's, yeah, and they call him a healer. And I don't know. It doesn't matter what you think about chiropractors, but this is what resonated with me. It was like 20 years ago. He had called, we had chatted and he said that, you know, he just went to a seminar over a weekend. I'm like, so what kind of a seminar, you know, because there's so many different seminars for these guys. And he went to a seminar on dialogues. What to say to people. You know, the thing is if he helps adjust somebody, you know, a hundred times, you can't say a hundred different things. But whatever you say, you should, you should be able to nail it. And you, and I thought to myself, if my brother who's a chiropractor sees the value and understand dialogue. And most REALTORS, you know, they stick their nose up to it. They stick their nose up to training and they stick their nose up to what to say and how to handle objections. But for me, that was, that was, I always believed in it. And then I really believed in it. So I think if you're a real estate agent, you really need to learn what to say and what not to say. Yeah. And you're right. That's, it's a practice. It's a discipline. It's a skill and it can be developed. You, you had also said something that I, a couple of things that I thought were really significant. So I just want to step on these a little bit because after 550 episodes, I've really yet to, there were a couple of things you said that I really want to. Really, sort of highlight because it's, it's unique to you. Number one, you said something that I thought was, was very, very powerful. You talked about in post or syndrome. Every young REALTOR or rather every new REALTOR, I should say. You don't have to be young to be a REALTOR. Of course, every new REALTOR goes through this. Especially when they get their first listing and their first buyer or even their first hand. They're going to necess, you know, they don't know everything. Of course, they may be out on their own, not in a group. And they may feel that way. What Michael said was something very, very subtle. It was a nuanced point, but it was a good one. And he was really talking about mindfulness. What he was saying was once he acknowledged, once he recognized what the syndrome was in his case in post or syndrome, by the way, very common. And I have it. I have it as a podcast host after five years. I still think like why would anyone listen to me? But me too, me too. And maybe it never goes away. And that's okay. Because as long as I can acknowledge, for example, I have an event I'm going to tonight at seven o'clock. I have to get dressed up. It's this fancy, whatever. And I don't know anybody there. I will literally not know one person. Well, I will know one person, but I probably won't even see this person. So I'm going blind. I know it about six p.m. tonight. My brain is going to go don't go. Stay at home. Play on the couch. Play with the cats. I just know that's what's going to happen. Now, since I know that's going to happen, I can be mindful of it. And then I have a strategy to overcome that so I could actually go to the event tonight because it's actually a good thing, a healthy thing for me to go do tonight. So you said this. And again, I know this seems maybe not as well related to real estate practice, but you know, understanding one's self and understanding these tendencies that we all have these urges or these thoughts that are maybe not super helpful. It's okay. We don't have to necessarily fix them as long as we can acknowledge them. And then as Michael said, you know, just create other skills to compensate for that. So I just wanted to honor you for saying that because I look at the fact that you say you still feel feel that from time to time is so human and honest. So thank you. The other thing I wanted to to mention. Well, now I've gotten lost myself, but it was, you know, what we'll get to it a little bit further on. I really want to dive into this book because I have, we've had a lot of authors on this show, a lot of agents who write books for various reasons. And yours is really a cool idea that I think should resonate not only with the brokerage community and all the people who listen, but maybe a consideration to provide this even to their clients. So the book is called seller mistakes. Tell us about it. What what is the book? Why do you write it? There's a copy of the book is that's what it looks like yellow book. Well, first off, the working title, which my publisher hated was called high level fiduciary sales because I work with a lot of attorneys. And I thought that would resonate. The publisher thought it sucked just plain out sucked. So we work that. So for me, I realize that most sellers, if they're going to pick you, if they're going to hire you, then you want to sound different. You want it in, and I know we're all trained the same way. And oftentimes when I go into a listening presentation, sometimes they'll interview 10 agents. Usually when I get hired, they always say the same thing. You are so much different because everybody else said the same thing. And everything I say is actually in the book. So the book kind of is my listening presentation. I guess you could say that. But so for me, I just I was I was continually told and I think everybody else's told that there's there's certain things you should be doing to sell a house. You need to advertise in the news paper. You need a real estate sign out there. You need you need to do open houses. All that other stuff. And I found out that the National Association of Rilters puts out a questionnaire to I think it's 160,000 people every year that just bought a house. And they ask them 135 questions. And over time, it was it was 100 questions out like 135 questions. And they asked them a whole slew of information. And all these questions. And if if you return it, then they send you coupons for all this stuff. So it's and it is really the preeminent and only real true survey, the real estate survey that's out there, the National Association of Rilters puts it out every year. And it costs you like 25 bucks or you can get the free version. And it's like 10 pages. And so I love data. And what I was reading in that was completely different than what I was being told by the industry. And I was really happy to say to sellers if that makes sense. I'll give you an example. My broker, every broker I've been I've been with all said the same thing. You need to do open houses, open houses, sell houses. But I mean, look, I should have preempted all of this by saying, if you're real estate agent, you're probably going to hate what I have to say. You're going to hate a lot of the stuff. I have to say, but I want you to know something. It's not my opinion. This is from surveys. So this whole and in the book, I was hoping to sell a few hundred copies and sold 40,000 copies. All of a sudden I get a phone call from the publisher saying you hit the Wall Street Journal best seller list number three. This is back. This has been two years now. But to go back to open houses as an example, the National Association of Rilters does not ask brand new buyers if you bought your house because you found it on an open house. Oh, you wonder why the reason why is the percentage of people that bought a house because they went through it on an open house is so low. And what they do is in the industry, everybody kind of knows that open houses have an 8% chance of selling the house. But get this. If you read the question, the question says, and I detail this in the book, the question says, did you find your house because of an open house sign of billboard, any kind of sign. This includes data, I'm sorry, not data, but this includes data for new construction, new construction, they're open all the time. So about 10% of the national stock is new construction. So they lop all of that in and it is 8% but like I said, they don't ask really, you know, they don't ask this the finite question. And it's probably, and nobody really knows it, but it's probably between two and four percent. So, so you got two and four percent there. Look, how about the real estate sign? The real estate sign is really important. The brand wants the sign out there. You have a less than 1% chance of selling your house because of the real estate sign. Right. Print ads and mailers. That's one less than 1% to. So if you're an agent, your broker is telling you to do open houses, do print print mailers and have the real estate sign that probably accounts for maybe five or six percent of the effective. So, I'm going to give you a little bit more of the effectiveness of selling your house. I kind of thought, well, I'm going to dig into all this data and learn a little bit more. And what for me, what I was looking at, I started doing a white paper and a white paper is kind of like a research paper and I started writing and I was. And it's loaded with data because I love data and the book is full of data. It's not a lot of some of it's my opinion, but the vast majority of us is really is hard data and it's all attributed to where it came from. And I started writing this white paper and I went to a seminar. I love seminars. But I want to seminar on writing a book. I kind of thought, well, I'll look into this thing. And after the seminar, I approached the publisher. I said, this is my idea. And he said to be a fantastic idea. So it took me five years to write this book. Look, every REALTOR has a little bit of ADD. We're busy. And I'll tell you it's tough. It's really tough to write a book. If anybody here is ever written a book, what do you look at it pulling out a book? No, I am, I forgot to take a, ignore me. I'm just taking that. That's right. But so it took me five years. I was hoping to sell a few hundred copies. And like I said, in the first three months, it sold almost 35,000 copies. And it's still selling. And a lot of a lot of the people that are buying our real estate real estate folks, there was a commercial real estate brokerage in Pasadena. The manager called me. We had coffee two months ago. And he wanted a box of books that were signed by me and he bought them from me and he's given it to all of his sales agents. So I think this would be, you know, this book is actually really intended for a home seller and primarily a seller who's gone through the process before. So they kind of they get it. They understand the first time home seller may not really quite understand the nuances and the difficulties and the challenges and mistakes because they haven't done it yet. But it also, it's a great tool for a, anybody across the country, if you wanted to buy it and use it for your listening presentation, I think it would, it would be great. And some of the, some of the items in there isn't that like I said, your REALTORS may not like this, but like dual agency. You know what, I get a lot of business because I bring up dual agency within the, yeah, let's, let's talk about dual agency. I love it. We all know that dual agency now, it's not always bad. I get it. I know people are going to, I have some bad reviews on Amazon and they're from REALTORS. They don't believe in this. But I think we could all agree that dual agency primarily almost always benefits the buyer and the real estate agent. It really, really benefits the seller yet. Okay, I think that's a fair statement, right? Yep, agreed. However, if you're in a listening presentation and you show up to some, to a seller, I think what I do is sellers want to see how different you are. I tell them I write out the gate. I said, I tell them I want to let you know how different I am. I won't represent a buyer on this transaction. I believe that dual agency is the scourge of our industry. And I go and some of them don't understand dual agency and some of them think that it's good if I have my own buyer. So I'll go into it. And then what I'll do is I'll tell them whoever you interview and I think you should interview multiple agents. But that agent should bring it up and that agent should bring it up in the first few minutes of the presentation. That's how important you shouldn't have to ask. And if you have to ask about it, then they know that it's important and then they know that they can't, you know, they really shouldn't be doing it. I think you should be preempted and tell them right up front. It's going to make you look better. It's going to make you make them realize you're a real true fiduciary and you really off their back. I'm a huge fan and thank you for all of this. This is such great stuff. I want to. I thought you may hate it. No, I like it because it makes perfect sense to me. Thank you. And I have a couple of thoughts. So first, I want to go back to open houses just for a second because here's what I heard. And here's what I see as an opportunity and I want you to tell me if you agree or correct maybe in a way because you're out there and the trench is actually doing it. But what I heard I'm I'm I'm I'm our marketing guy or our company. So I'm always thinking with my marketing hat. And what I heard by saying, you know, open houses. This is again, a huge part of a listing presentation. Here's all the cool stuff I'm going to do for you. Mr. Mrs. Seller. I'm going to do open houses. I'm going to put a sign up. I'm going to have flyers. We're going to paper the neighborhood. We're going to get this out on every website on the planet. And but open houses specifically. I think it's a huge opportunity to say, let me tell you what open houses actually do. Mr. or Mrs. Seller. They're great for me. And here's why they're great for me. And they're great for, you know, and maybe other agents in my office who might be with me on the open house because it's a lead generator for me. I get to have all these buyers come in. Maybe some of them are unrepresented. I get to walk out with all this new business. Is it actually going to help you sell your home? Well, let me show you the data. The data says probably not. And so I'm happy to do them because I've always wanted to grow my business. But I don't want to do to do these with the with the expectation that you think it's actually going to help move your home. Here's what I'm here's what the data says will actually get your home sold. Even just saying that to me separates you from a lot of other agents curious to get your thought. Oh, absolutely. I mean, I talk to sellers all the time to say I'm going to do what's most effective. What's most effective is obviously great marketing being on the multiple listing service. All the other portals, great photos, great description. An agent that's going to pick up the phone. I mean, this is one of the things I tell them. Have your friends call me. And if I don't call them back within two hours, you can fire me. I love that. I mean, you ought to be able to return a phone call in two hours, right? Absolutely. Yeah, it's, but we've all been there when we call the listing agent or in the buyer's side. And they don't call you back or they don't call you back for two days or something like that. It's frustrating. But you know, the biggest complaint that people have and probably REALTORS do in real estate is communication. Lack of communication. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I once, I once had on one of the very top agents here in Chicago and I asked her, I go, what do you think it is that you do differently? And I know that this isn't a complete answer, but it was the first answer she said. And when I pressed her, she goes, no, that's pretty much it. This is, this is a crazy thing to say because it sounds so obvious. But I've yet to hear very many other agents say this except for top producers like yourself who do this. She says, I call every one of my clients every week and I give them an update on what's going on because I don't want them to have to call me to find out what's happening with the home that's for sale or the home I'm trying to put it off or on or whatever. She, and I said, okay, well, yeah, everyone does that. She goes, no, everybody does not do that. And that, and that was her sort of like, that's what I do. And I go, that is shocking that it is that the bar could be that low to clear because it seems like such an easy thing to do. I tell people I call them by Friday, even if I have no update, I'm just going to let them know there's no update. And then I think we all have these programs where we can send the market updates so they know how many clicks and stuff like that. But yeah, you got to, you got a column and you know, if you don't call them on a Friday by Friday evening, they're going to be bugging you over the weekend. And they're going to be pissed. So you may as well pick up the phone and just call them. I mean, I'm here from you. Of course, yeah. And, and we're, we're comp, well, I guess that's a different conversation, a compensation, but, but we are real estate professionals are compensated quite nicely for this service. And, you know, putting a home on the MLS is, I mean, anyone could really do that. But being in communication and constant communication, they're paying really for expertise. They're paying for customer service. They're paying for guidance. And, and that's where, where your value comes in. I have a question though. Let's say you get a text at 10 p.m. And you're done for the day, you're maybe spending time with, with friends or family. Are you, do you tell them, hey, you know, what do you do in that scenario? Are you, are you still responding or are you going, I've already told them that my hours are this and this and I'll get to them next morning. You know, what are your boundaries around that? I may be able to agree with this. I mean, no one's dying in real estate. It could wait to the next day. I mean, there's, it's not like medical emergency usually. Usually, I, I try to set the parameters when, you know, you start getting to know people and you start being friendly with them. But I don't tell them right up front, but after they've signed the listing, I go, hey, by the way, I just want to let you know I've got two kids. I've got a wife. I like to sit down for dinner every night. If, you know, if you text me, I will respond, but it might be as late as 9 o'clock because I do stuff with the boys with your boys, scouts and blah, blah, blah. I think if you, you tell them that you will respond and it's easier to take with the text that, you know, most everybody's great. I mean, sometimes we do have monster clients that are just, you can, you can never make them happy and guy, you can't wait to sell those things or just let them expire and walk away, right? But it's part of the business. But most people, if you just tell them that, like, I will respond. They're cool. Or they'll just say, you know what? Probably nothing will, you know, is that important? Well, it can just wait till the next day. But I did tell people that text is great for me. It's, if it's great for you, great. But I think one of the things you should ask for clients is to, is how do you like to be communicated with 100%? Do you like email? Do you like, to phone call? Do you like text? Because if you have an older client and you're texting them, you might know that you're just pissing them off. You know, because they just, this is not for them. So you've got to ask. Yeah, I have a little pro tip to throw on top of that. So asking Michael is such a smart thing. How do you prefer to be communicated with? And then I had, I heard it, I only heard it one agent ever say this, but I think this is such a cool thing. If you're working with clients who have different religious affiliations or maybe from different cultures, different ethnicities, and they may have special days that they do not work. So that's also a nice thing or maybe certain holidays that they want respected. And they might not want to hear from you on those days. So that's another great question is, hey, are there any days that you observe where you don't want me contacting you? And again, all of this just demonstrates that you care about the person that you care enough to ask and you're care enough to want to be the, you know, in doing it their way. But I want to go back to listing presentations because you are clearly the king of listing presentations. You wrote a book that essentially is a listing presentation, which every one of our listeners needs to read. I mean, 40,000 people have already bought it. It's clearly a good book. It's got great reviews. And I can't wait to dig in. But I would also like to know, you know, you said, hey, this is why I don't do dual agency. I love that within the first few minutes. Here's what dual agency is. Here's why I think it's the surge of the business. And let me explain, let me sort of explain the math about why as a fiduciary, it doesn't really make a lot of sense for me to do that because my job is to protect you and et cetera. And you have data to suggest that dual agency doesn't benefit the list or the seller. So would love to know what else you, you may do in a listing presentation that differentiates yourself. I actually tell people they should interview a few agents. So, so the national stats, 75% of all home sellers interview one agent. 10% of them interview three or more. And then the crazy thing is that 75% of all home sellers never use that same agent again. That they won the hiring. So you got to wonder why there's a lot of reasons why I mean one of the one of the amazing stats from the National Association of Realters, they say that 85% of all agents will be out of the 85% of all new agents will be out of the business within the first five years. So if you're, you know, if you're talking to a seller and you're asking them, hey, who are you interviewing? And then you can say, by the way, just so you know the stat, it's a crazy stat. But the National Association of Realters says that if you're hiring somebody that's only been in the business up to five years, it's an 85% chance that they're going to be out of the business. So you could be hiring a loser. Or that's not a need. I shouldn't say that, but you do have to be careful, you know, in this business, I mean, experience is really, excuse me, in this business experience is really important. Are you just look at the scoreboard? I mean, do you want to work with somebody who's winning all the time or somebody who's trying to win? Yeah, absolutely, absolutely. That's a really, really great point. And we should also mention too that Michael really plays it in a pretty exclusive sandbox with his listings and his clients. You know, I was prusing some of your listings. It was not uncommon to see listings in the mega million sort of range. I know your average home sale is well over is right around two million or so. And you go up from there. And so these I'm curious if you did you always play in the in the luxury or the high net worth space or were you did you sort of eventually graduate to those types of clients. So I know where you're going with this because everybody wants to if you want to make more money and real estate the easiest way to do it is to go to a higher price point. And when you when you get to those higher price point ones, I think it's important to market yourself a lot more. And I mean, you know, you should be doing everything you can to sell that house, but do more stuff that's probably not necessarily going to help the seller, but you yourself. Do more social media do better photos do you know a little bit more a little bit more promotion. And certainly, you know, all of that's going to help, but is it are those little things really going to be the the the difference maker to sell that house. Probably not. I mean, we all kind of know that if you're priced correctly and if you answer your phone and you have the right photos and you have a good description. You usually take care of itself. I mean, I think that's a fair assessment. People screw that up all the time. But but to answer your question, how did it it was part of it is obviously the market in Pasadena, the average sales price when I got into the business when I was flipping houses, the average sales price was probably might have been 300,000. And now the average sales price here in 2024 is easily a million six million five. So I had that benefit. But I think it's important like part of the thing that slowed me down as an agent is that that imposter syndrome. I always kind of feel like, Oh, I can't do that two million dollar thing. They'll never hire me. You just got to lean into it and and you know, even if you've got an intimidating listing coming up, just do it. Just do it for practice. I mean, frankly, I go on listing listing appointments that I have an idea. I have a pretty good idea. I'm never going to get because they have a family member or somebody or I was able to weasel my way in because they've already made a decision. They're going to hire someone so what they haven't signed the listing contract and I say, Hey, can you just give me a shot for 20 minutes? And they say basically yell, do it, but it's going to be a waste of time. So you know, that's a great opportunity. You should do it. You should absolutely do it. And you know what, even even more so get this, you should lean into it and just practice your your dialogues, practice the words that you, you know, you were so intimidated by, by say it. And just kind of forget that impostor syndrome and go for it because once in a while, you're going to nail it once in a while. You're going to get that listing, but you've got to lean into this stuff. Yeah, it's this willingness to willingness to lose and willingness to be wrong or willingness to do it imperfectly or just the willingness to it's just it's just trying right. And yes, the impostor syndrome comes up it it deflates us. It's hard for us to it's the it's the boulder we have to push up the hill every day, but, but it's it's a worthy effort. And if if you can, obviously, Michael is a perfect example, he is willing to not get a listing. He is willing to still go and he wants the opportunity and it's not fun to not get a listing, but it is also practice for the next listing. It's great. We should absolutely do it. We should absolutely do it. I mean, what I meant to say is it's called failing forward. That's important in your business is do you have to fail forward yet to keep going at it? Go on, go on wild, little bit of wild use chase is not too much. I mean, you know, you shouldn't be preparing for four or five hours for a listing presentation. You just shouldn't be there's a lot of easier ways of, but you should have a really good decent CMA package. You should have a really good little marketing package, something you can just email ahead of time. They may not look at it. So you show up with something that's bound with paper, but you should not be preparing for four or five hours. It's I think that's that that's ridiculous. Yeah, and you should just yeah analysis paralysis, I guess, but you should know exactly what you what you want to accomplish in that presentation. What you want to communicate and more most importantly, what information you're looking to extract, which means obviously, as you said at the beginning, listening, asking the right questions, being it's really the fastest way I've found to building relationships with people is getting interested in them. And this isn't anything new Dale Carnegie wrote about this in the early 1900s, how to win friends and influence people is basically just ask them about them. But it really is super important, especially as an agent, because you are fiduciary, you do need to act in their best financial interest, and you will only know how to do that if you ask a lot of questions in those buyer and seller presentations. So I could not could not agree with you more there, but I know the thing I forgot earlier, I know we're going back about 20 minutes, but but it relates to what you just said, the dialogue this idea that I was I was really impressed by your your brother, the the chiropractor who said, you know, I probably should learn what to say and what to ask in addition chiropractor is a very physical job, but it really doesn't require much speaking because what they're doing is, you know, hands on work. But yet he saw the value in that and he knows that it's critically important sort of how you say things what you say with respect to patient, you know, and professional. And this doesn't change as a REALTOR, right? You're the professional and you have clients and this idea of practicing dialogue is something that doesn't really get talked enough about, I think, in this industry. It's certainly something a good coach would have you do is role playing and memorizing, I mean, look, you know, we want to be able to go off script, but you need a script to be able to go off script, I think. Yeah, yeah. And so I love the fact that I know you you don't spend four to five hours preparing for a listing presentation, but you know exactly what you're wanting to accomplish in that listing presentation, because of course you've been successful. It doesn't just happen randomly because you showed up a bunch of times. You obviously have a very strong process and you wrote a book about it, which is which is again, seller mistakes. Tell us a little bit more about the book. So the book really goes into detail. It's it's your sort of listing presentation, by the way, how generous is Michael to write a book basically showcasing his entire process for the whole world to see. He he's not threatened by this. He's actually it was probably a real honor for him to be able to share that. So really encourage everyone to head over to Amazon, pick up the book, and I'm excited to read it, but tell us a little bit more about the book. So, um, God, there's so many things. I actually have a chapter about why it's wrong. It's it's a mistake to hire a friend or family member to sell your house. And oftentimes we're I think we're all confronted with this way going to listing presentation or you find out later that they're just hiring. They're using you for information and they're just going to tell their friend or family member to sell. So I kind of jump right into that when I'm talking with them and I ask them, are you interviewing other agents? I mean, by the way, you shouldn't be afraid to ask questions. Ask, you know, you want to find out what their motivation is, all this other stuff. But oftentimes I'll ask you can just ask them, am I competing with a friend or family member? And if they'll they usually will tell you or if they say, you know, I'm not really comfortable telling you that. Well, they just told me that's yes. But for example, on the friend and family issue, one of the things that I bring up is, you know, if you if you are hiring a friend or family member, I just want to throw something out at you. And they go, what? You know, because I like, you know, what could this role to be saying? I said, when you hire somebody like that, you leave, you're leaving the nuclear option off the table. And then they go, what's the nuclear option? The nuclear option is that you can't yell at them and you can't fire them because you're going to ruin a family relationship or a friendship. And it's not worth it. And to see this all the time, you shouldn't do business with people with your friends or family members. Look, you can hire me, you can fire me, you can yell at me, you can blast me, you can ignore me, you can be rude to me, you can't do that with the other people. There's a lot to be said about having a business relationship with somebody. And oftentimes they'll be like, oh my god, you're right. And then they'll talk about how, you know, everybody has stories about a relationship that went sour because you went into business with that person. But I think it's important to kind of throw that out there while you're talking with somebody, maybe over the phone or when you're getting there, but one of that I want to backtrack a little bit what I said about motivation, you know, only motivated people by or sell real estate. Okay, right. We all agree with that. Okay. So it's important to figure out their motivation. One of the questions I ask, oh, home sellers is even on the phone, if I get a phone call from somebody and I'll just say, hey, I have a few questions for you. Imagine I just sold your house, you're super happy with me and all that other good stuff. Where do you sleep tonight? Leave it like that. Where do you sleep tonight? If you have the answer, the, if the answer is, I don't know, I'll just figure that out later. I'm just looking, and then they'll tell you I'm just looking for the best price and I'll figure it out later. Well, you've got yourself an unmotivated seller. You need to be careful. So that's one of the most important questions to ask somebody. And I would do that on the phone call when they, when they call you. And then at least you know where you're standing. And if you decide you want to move forward with an interview, great, but at least you know that, you know, they're probably going to just waste your time. That's a, you know, that is an amazing tip. You're kind of blowing my mind right now because it, I've never really heard that specific question before. It's a brilliant question because it does sort of give you insight into how much they've thought about this and how they're looking, you're right. And they might just be in that preliminary stage of looking, which, which is fine. If you know that as the agent and you're like, okay, well, I know this is a 12 to 16 month sort of thing. Okay, well, I'll just build the relationship now. But at least I know kind of where they're at. And so that they, so if I'm okay with them wasting my time, at least I can make that decision as the agent versus finding out down the road that they've been wasting my time. Well, so get this. This goes back to the stats. It's kind of boring, but it's, it's important to say the National Association of Rilters asked that question, why did you sell your house? The top 10 reasons why people are selling their house are their life events, divorce, job, whatever, downsize, upside blah, blah, blah. It's not in the top 10 or in the top 30 or the top 100, it is not, oh, if I just get my price, I'll move. That's why that's not why people sell to get just to get their price. So you got to jump on that. That's a really, really good point. So boy, that's a, that is a great point, Michael. I really appreciate that. Again, these are the kind of things that are in the book, everyone. And Michael does a deep dive into, and you know, he, he mentioned at the beginning of this conversation that the National Association of Rilters does this study every year. And it is fascinating. And I really, it's worth the $25 if you don't have the 25, as Michael said, read the free version, because you're going to find out at the very least, why, how people choose their REALTOR, and or at least the statistics of what is most likely going to be the motivators for people to choose their agent. And what's interesting to me is, you know, for 20 years, I've been hearing that technology is ultimately going to replace the agent because the agent won't be as significant. Because if we looked at, you know, the, the, what agents did, a lot of the focus was on access to MLS. Of course, we know that everyone has access now. So that's not, not necessary. You're the value really comes in in many other ways, everything other, necessarily, then maybe just the home selection, because of course people can really do that on their own largely. But then they're going to look to you for all of the, and again, I think this too is part of the presentation when you talk to a buyer or seller. Here's how I earn my fee or my service. This is actually what I do for you. This is, you know, here's the data to support it. And here's why, why it's significant. You want to hear something crazy. In the last 20 years, according to the National Association of REALTORS, a little over 20 years ago, which is, you know, or it was more like 30 years ago, the sellers said that they value, they highly value the help of a real estate agent. It was in the high 70s. And then we had the internet and all this boom and all these, you know, great, you know, advances. And it is, it has gone up an average of almost 1% and it's almost 90%. And the reason why people actually, I mean, everybody says we're going by by actually consumers want us even more. And because it's just so complicated, so difficult, they're so busy. They just don't hit people. I mean, in California, our purchase agreement is being revised again. It's been revised every six months for the last five years. Our listing form is going to be completely revised. There's, I mean, there's so many new forms and stuff like that. Well, I don't think we're going to go by by and there are certain forms you need and certain forms you really shouldn't have, but you could use, but if you use them, you're kind of not practicing it correctly. And if an attorney gets a hold of that, they can show a pattern of you not understanding the process. And it's just like, why would a, why would a consumer not want a real estate agent? But, you know, it's not my opinion. Those are the stats. Yeah, and very encouraging statistics. I think here in Chicago last year, 95% of all residential transactions went through a REALTOR, which was actually up from previous years, you know, a half percent or here and there. But it's not going down, which is a good good thing for people in the industry like everyone listening and myself as well, and Michael, but really showcasing the value of what REALTORS provide that even though what MLS used to be under lock and key. It is not under lock and key anymore and more changes are coming, of course, as we're all following, but it has not been under lock and key for quite some time. Zillow essentially blew that out of the water. And we still are as important. In fact, more important now because it's such a large financial transaction. I just went through it myself maybe three years ago. And I was, I'm curious to get your thoughts on this. I, well, I'm not a practicing agent. So this was a little bit easier for me to do, but I did not represent myself. I had my boss represent me because number one, he did it for free. He's a guy, he's my employer is a good guy. But also because I was way too emotional and I knew I was going to I was in distress. I was like, I don't know I was I wasn't thinking clearly I couldn't be objective. And as a result, I had somebody else do it for me, but I thought that was a smart play for me because I was not able to see my own my own deal clearly because I know it was so much money. I was I saved up for years and I was putting this big down payment down and I was terrified. I think we all have blind spots. I sold a house one of my own homes about two years ago during COVID. It was just a great time for me to sell this one property and I hired an agent in our office. I paid her a full commission. And I was surprised at the blind spots that I had just because I was emotionally involved and I don't know I was kind of surprised the blind spots like I said that I had and I'm really happy I hired her and I made a lot more money than I thought and was more smoother. And but yeah, there you go. I mean, we all have blind spots. Yeah, and it's also a good thing to remember that this is what our clients go through, right? This is what you know and as agents, this is our value that we can help reduce that stress. We can help or at least tackle the stress or say, hey, I'm taking it off your plate onto my plate as your professional. I'm going to take care of this. I'm on I'm on it. So you don't have to be as freaked out. So I'm a huge huge fan of that. I have one question. So actually, I have lots of questions. But well, I have this one question I've been wanting to ask you. So we know right now it is it's a difficult time, I think, to be a REALTOR. Certainly brokerage production is although it seems to be getting better. So that's exciting. But certainly last year was a tough year for most agents, most brokerages and you know rates were high inventory was low. What advice might you have to somebody who's listening who maybe isn't flush with clients right now right now they're going well my buyers want to wait for rates to come down the fed. So they're going to cut rates three more times this year inventories low. I can't seem to get anybody to list. What might you suggest is just ways to stay busy and keep active. That's a great question because it's a question I asked myself last year last year I had three months period where nothing happened and I had a great year. I would I outsold everybody in this office. But it was three months and it was scary. And so what I did was I'm going to plug another book and it's an old book. It's called the seven levels of communication from Michael mayor. And I used to be a Keller Williams and Keller Williams for their mega camps would always promote an author. And I thought I think this point one of the best books that a REALTOR can read. And I'll save you all I'll save you the money and I'll tell you the story the story is about it down and out loan officer that can't get things going. He doesn't understand why everybody else is more successful. And he goes to the seminar and learns and this is how the principles of the book are taught. And what he learns is that you need to be influential. And there's different levels of being influential and there's different levels how you communicate that that's the seven levels. And there's a line. Imagine a line here and everything you do below this line is not influential and everything above this line is influential. There's four things that are very influential that you can do in real estate sales. And I think I guess it would probably apply to almost any other sale. The number one thing you can do is seminars. So if you can think like I'm doing I do seminars on my book. I have people come over. It's a dinner event. I buy them dinner. I bring dinner in. They're in my office. I give a market update. I chat about the pitfalls of selling your house. I take question and answers. And then I do a book signing. And then every time I do that I get four phenomenal leads, four or five phenomenal listing leads. I want by the way I'm mostly a listing agent. I don't go for the buyers. I have buyer transactions, but 90% of my sales are listings. So seminars. And you can do that with buyer seminars too. It's easy. It's not that hard to do all of this. The next thing you can do is what's called face to face. And face to face is going to be lunches or dinners. But you got to get face to face with people. The next level is voice to voice. You know everybody can you can pick up the phone and just dial for dollars. That's influential. And the next thing below that is handwritten letters. And in his book he actually talks about how to write a letter. What kind of letter had you used? What kind of form you know you don't want to brand it with your real estate company. There's a lot of little nuances. Then you have this line. And below that is uninfluential stuff. And guess what's under there? It's emails, social media, mailers, door hangers. And that's all the lazy stuff that REALTORS do because it's normal for anybody to hide behind all that stuff. A behind hide behind everything and just kind of do all of that stuff. But I think any top producer is going to that's going to be listening to this is is probably going to acknowledge that voice to voice face to face and seminars are fantastic. And I know that there's REALTORS out there that get a lot of business from Facebook. And that's fine. But if you're going to do Facebook, I mean you need to nail it. Oh, you need to nail it and you need to be doing it probably every day. Two hours a day. And yeah. So you know, if you that's why we talked about off this off air. I don't really I don't have a lot of social media stuff. I mean I have a little Facebook business page. I have a little YouTube channel. But I don't get any leads from it and sure it's a hole in my business. I could be doing something better. But I'd rather not I'd rather I like to do face to face and seminars. That's that's my thing. And you know the national association of REALTORS. They they they survey people on why they hired a certain real estate agent 75% of that decision is because they they like you and they trust you. Okay, hello. Get out there. Have lunch with people. You don't have to have expensive lunches. Grab breakfast, grab coffee, grab dinner. You know easy. Do the same thing with attorneys. You know, CPAs those are where you referral sources. If they like you and they can remember you. I mean this business is so simple. It's hard. I know. I love that. You just you just got me on that one. It's so simple. It's it's hard. It's it's and it is hard. But it is simple. Right. It's like put it's like a push up. It's hard. But it's simple and it's effective. And so what you're really talking about how I heard that is influential activities are interpersonal meaning we are we are interacting with another human being either in person over the phone. Or you know via a handwritten note or or something something to that effect. But but or you know we're either sitting with them. We're talking with them or we're writing them. And you know just go back to handwritten notes for a second. I mean Brian Biffini built a whole career not this is reducing him to just one thing which is not fair because he's a he's a great he's a great coach. But one of his big tenants is handwritten notes and he's not wrong. And in fact nobody does them at all anymore. So the idea of even doing a handwritten note in and of itself is going to separate you and I like the idea of not using company letterhead you know get get your own stationary or just do some you know way and we'll we'll plug that the seven levels of communication books so people can learn exactly sort of the the thoughts behind how to do this but interpersonal communication is is is the way and I'll tell you one of the top agents in Chicago I asked her what she's doing this year. And she's goes you know I have a lot of people she's been doing this 20 plus years I love to get your your opinion on this is speaking of interpersonal is she has of course people as they retire they move out of Chicago and Illinois and go somewhere warm. And a lot of times that's Florida or Texas or Arizona or wherever it may be and she refers business all over the place and she goes you know I've never visited any of these other agents so she flies now she flies down she interviews three or four different agents she hangs out with them for a day or so to really understand what do they do how do they do it. And I said boy that is a brilliant strategy because of course hopefully some leads will come her way as she's providing leads but she goes no these are my clients I have to make sure that as I'm referring this out to somebody in Boca Raton or wherever that they are as good as I am because I just can't look at Zillow and go well this is the person with the best number of reviews I mean yeah that's that's a start but she goes I need to meet this person face to face I want to see how they interact with their clients and I thought boy that what a smart strategy. Yeah that's great and I think for a newer agent you had asked about this you know what do you do it's easy for a new agent I think to feel like a fire hose is hit your mouth yeah it's really hard to swallow and so I've always there's two things I've always told agents one eight one one I haven't said this in a while but it's really important you should only listen to people that are making a lot of money. That's true yes. Does everybody's going to give you opinions when you get into the business oh I used to do this I used to do that and this is how it works and it's like well if they're not okay if you want to make a million dollars in real estate talk to people that are making a million dollars in real estate sorry don't listen to anybody else you know but the other thing I think is really important and I learned this when I was at Keller Williams and I think the world of Keller Williams and the education stuff that they have but you should what I learned from there is you should do three things and do them really well don't do more than three things it's just too hard to do so if you're going to do seminars great you're going to do social media great but just but don't don't feel like you have to do 10 things because you spread yourself too thin you're not doing it very well and the consumer is going to figure that out really quick and you're not going to get any business. Yeah Jack of all trades master of none so you want to be a master so master 3 yeah I I'd read that in many many business books years ago just in a day like running the business here it's like do like I'm really good at like 3 to 4 things tops maybe 5 maybe but really probably 3 and so I also think too you know being able to say to doing your listing presentations you know this is what I do this is my business is what I do well here's the data to back that up I love the one thing you said I just want to go back to this because it is is really a powerful thing I encourage you Mr. and Mrs. Teller to explore other agents before making a decision what what why would someone say that well to me it demonstrates a really high level of value to because you are actually saying something that is in their best interest and I think that is a real demonstration of character and the willingness to say your needs are more important than mine which is really a significant message that I'm assuming most agents aren't going to communicate in that listing presentation I love that you say I'd encourage you to talk to others well you're not really let in the wolf into the hells because chances are they're not going to let the wolf and they're not going to do it I just right you're giving them good advice and they really should do it once in a while I have that happened and then they call me a few weeks later they're like I actually took your advice I interviewed three other agents what a waste of my time you look make you look better not be like well either way it's going to make you look good because whether or not you even get the thing they're going to remember that you were so honest and so helpful that even if you know it's that sort of almost reciprocity thing that that principle of reciprocity where we do something for someone they feel in obligation to sort of return that favor but you're absolutely right it reminds me of the top when I was a financial advisor a million years ago the top agent or the top that financial advisor in our office million dollar way you know big big revenue producer he goes I'm going to tell you guys exactly what I do every day and none of you are going to do it so and you're right so by telling it you know the client hey this is what I really suggest you should do they're not going to do it but or I mean they might do it and that's in their best interest if they do if they don't they still look at you and go wow that person was willing to invite in the competition because that's how confident he is in his own services I think that's a powerful message it's also a said commentary about what you said is that we're sitting there I'm giving you all this I think is great advice I think this is the stuff that's made me over a million dollars a year but most people won't do it and I learned that years ago because I used to be very I used to keep everything close to the chest and I didn't want to share and because I thought I don't want somebody to get my ideas you know I tell everybody everything that I do it is very seldom this somebody I'm the only agent in our office that uses our office for networking events I do I just had one two nights ago we had 35 people here I invited a whole bunch of attorneys and it was cost me 600 bucks I had a group of 35 attorneys and CPAs in my office for $600 I sorry that's a great deal and we just yep yeah no agenda no presentation I had some music going on I bought a bunch of booze I ordered three pizzas and I told them there's no agenda would you like to come over for a mixer it's from 6 to 8 boom I mean and they're in my turn they're on my turf I mean this is something I just started and I read the book 20 years ago I should have done this a long time ago but that's something anybody can do because you know if you think about it I couldn't take 35 attorneys and CPAs help to coffee for $600 right now I got them all circulating and chitchatting is like this is gold I think I'm going to keep doing this stuff yeah and it's interpersonal and it's also of service to them because they do have clients they need to refer they do have these situa problems that you can help solve and vice versa of course your clients need a state planning attorneys they need divorce attorneys sometimes they need you know countenance and professional services and I love I love that that is that is a great you know we have a space here in our office I said earlier we have almost 800 agents you know how often one of our agents uses our space which by the way 24 seven access we do not even like they can come in anytime three in the morning they can come in nobody ever uses it and and it which is a shame because you're absolutely right education in person education you know we're all sick of zoom meetings everyone let's remember that so yeah great good Michael I could talk to you all day but you're too busy to talk to me all day and I would like to really well that is we you have given us so much value in this really I really encourage everyone Michael said probably about 10 things that every one of our listeners could start doing or or adjust their strategy to consider to do a little bit differently and really well it was it was really amazing and all of this is also in his book seller mistakes again number top seller on Amazon number one actually on Amazon so I'm worried I have a link to that in the show notes please pick up the book consider also maybe sharing it with your clients this is a great maybe somebody who's not quite ready to sell but wants to get say hey I've got a book I want you to read so that you can get educated so that when you are ready you know boy I mean imagine doing that for sure somebody you we now have something to give them and it's a value will they read it who knows but they're going to see that you care enough about what their process is to actually help educate them and you the agent should read it too because you're going to learn exactly how Michael has done it for 20 plus years 25 plus years and he is really at the at the top of the mountain as far as production goes so why not just steal his ideas he put them all out there for you to take you can always call if you have a client that you're going to be interviewing for in a few weeks you can call him and say I'm going to send you a book it's from this crazy guy in Pasadena who wrote this book 40,000 people bought it it's the number three Wall Street Journal it's it's somebody who really nailed the principles down and I'm just going to send you the book and you can just you can go on Amazon's I think it's like 10 bucks for the soft cover if you want I'm not trying to sell book I'm trying to help you get some ideas but you can send it to them they'll read it because there's no other book out there like that and as long as you agree to those principles and the principles are not that big of a deal you're not going to do a dual agency you're not going to rely on open houses sure you can have a real estate song sure you're going to do mail or sure you're going to do all that stuff but you're it's it's really going to it's going to help you out it's going to make you look really smart too it will cut out the this was one of the things I do is when they read it the chapter about hiring friends and family members it's going to most likely it's going to get them to go forget this I'm not going to hire a friend or family member it's going to open up an opportunity for you there if there is an opportunity but that's that's just an idea you can send them out or I mean if you wanted to you can send it on my website and they can listen to the audio book for free you know that's kind of awkward of course but but you can also send them a digital copy I'm not sure how that works with with digital versions because they have to have a kindle for that sure well we will we will by the way Michael just said something very very generous so if anyone wants to listen to his audio book it is it is located it is for free on his website Michael B Bell dot com will have a link to that of yeah you don't have to sign in or anything like that it's just it's just free it's just generous as I've ever heard from an author so thank you Michael for that everyone please support Michael let him know how well he did on the show today let him know in particular not how well he performed but how well he assisted you in your business we really you know getting somebody like like a Michael and all of our guests it's it's these these are busy people with not a ton of time and Michael does not need to sell these books to survive he's doing this out of the goodness of his heart so thank you Michael on behalf of the audience for all your tips all your advice and for the book itself and also a free audio book guys I mean come on that that is that is incredible and I'm not trying to sell book I believe it or not if you're a self published author on Amazon they rip you off they just you don't really make that much money so no it's it's tough it's about to get the information out there and make hopefully make a positive change but I want to throw something out there also and I'd be a horrible real REALTOR if I didn't say this but if you have any needs in the Pasadena area I work Pasadena, Lachanada, San Marino, San Gabriel, Sierra Madre, Monrovia, Glendale, Burbank, Lachanada, Lacharcenta those areas I'm an expert in those areas if you have a need out there if you have a client if you if you just want to chit chat about stuff pick up the phone and call me and I'd love to talk to agents anybody if I can talk to you if you have if you have clients that move to those areas yeah Michael is the guy so please other agents consider building a relationship with Michael because he has clients that move out of those areas too and maybe you guys could you know become partners in that sense so if anyone out there is looking
