[00:01:36] agents and for real estate agents. My name is DJ Paris. I'm your guide and host through the show.
[00:01:42] And in just a moment, we're going to be speaking with top producer and team lead court and
[00:01:46] half field. But before we get to court, I just wanted to say thank you because by the time you hear
[00:01:51] this, it'll be probably about three weeks after I've recorded it. But we actually had our very
[00:01:56] biggest month ever as far as downloads and listens, which actually has been every month since we
[00:02:02] started. We're super lucky to have always kind of gone up. But guys, we hit like a new plateau
[00:02:07] last month. So that would have been October of this year. So thank you.
[00:02:12] Just September, December, you know, might not be as high because of the holidays. But we are so
[00:02:17] grateful, which basically what I'm saying is thank you because we are not spending money on
[00:02:22] advertising and the only way this is really getting out there is if people somehow stumble across
[00:02:26] it on their own or that you're telling them about it. My guess is you're telling them about it.
[00:02:31] And so we want to say thanks. Really, it's been a long wild ride. Five years now. We're going to
[00:02:36] keep going. But please keep telling every agent, you know, about our show, our whole mission is to

[00:03:38] But Courtney launched her career in real estate, believing you 100% get what you work for.
[00:03:45] Authenticity paired with hard work and determination is carried her team of six into the top one
[00:03:50] percent of Northeast Ohio. She's closing and her and her team are closing a home every three days.
[00:03:55] And again, only six team members. Now one day it just clicked said Courtney and the freedom to live
[00:04:01] life on her own terms was hers for the choosing she held the power. She chose how hard she worked her
[00:04:07] schedule, her paycheck and her opportunities and work cited to chat with her today. And she is

[00:04:42] as well as a social media guide that Courtney is generously going to provide to all of our
[00:04:47] audience, which is also in the show notes. So Courtney, welcome to the show.
[00:04:51] Well, thank you for having me. I really appreciate it. I am a long time listener. I just
[00:04:56] look into an episode this morning on the way to work. Wow. Well, I am so honored to hear that and
[00:05:01] really grateful to have you on the podcast as well because you have what you and your team have
[00:05:07] accomplished in a relatively short amount of time is just nothing more than incredible. But before we
[00:05:13] get to sort of the present day, I'd love to start at the beginning. So can you tell us a little bit
[00:05:18] about why you got into real estate and how you got into real estate? Absolutely. So I got into real estate
[00:05:24] truly by half in stance in 2018. It was a family decision. My husband's family owned a brokerage
[00:05:30] at the time. And you know, I was a stay at home mom and I was bored. I was actually spending more
[00:05:37] money as a stay at home mom out of boredom that my husband was like, you need to go do something.
[00:05:42] So I was like, well, what if I go into the family business? And I did. And I I loved it from the start.
[00:05:50] I had a slow start with it though because right after I got my license, my husband's uncle who
[00:05:55] was the broker actually was diagnosed with cancer. And he ended up passing away a year later.
[00:06:01] So it wasn't really until 2019 that I really hit the ground running with my career. And I chose
[00:06:09] McDowell Homes. I interviewed a few different brokerages, but they were one of the smaller boutique
[00:06:15] independent brokerages in Cleveland. And I really loved their culture and what they stood for.
[00:06:19] It was a good fit. And that's just really where I've made myself a home. And I decided to start our
[00:06:27] team here. And so over the last three years, I've just really poured myself into this, you know,
[00:06:32] this baby that I created your home court team. And here we are.
[00:06:37] Well, you are killing it. And I think we want to just maybe remind everyone that you've only been
[00:06:45] really been practicing for, you know, a handful of years. And you started right when COVID was
[00:06:51] happening. So the fact that you started and again on the heels of a tragedy and my condolences for
[00:06:57] that. But also, disability to start at, you know, tragedy aside, just COVID. It's its own tragedy,
[00:07:05] of course. And what it did to, you know, to agents and their production and everyone was,
[00:07:11] was obviously struggling as agents to produce. And of course, last year was was a pretty good year
[00:07:17] for a lot of agents because there was a lot more activity as we were all getting back to some degree
[00:07:21] of normalcy. But to then, but this, you know, just to be able to to start at this pretty challenging
[00:07:28] time is incredible. And how did you, how did you know to create it? Did you create a team right
[00:07:34] away? Or were you already sort of chugging along yourself and sort of needed help? Or what was the,
[00:07:39] how was the decision made for that? So I will say, with the one thing that I really took away,
[00:07:46] besides the opportunity that I got from my husband's uncle when I came on to the family brokerage,
[00:07:51] was I remember him. He had just missed a phone call. And I was sitting at the desk and I was just
[00:07:57] kind of like watching him because I was new and I didn't know what I was doing. And it, in my mind,
[00:08:02] I was like, Oh, well, he has time to call that person back. But literally he would just miss it.
[00:08:06] And he was already dialing the person back. And I was like, Oh, my gosh, that's the type of
[00:08:10] hustle that I need. And I knew that I had it like buried down in me. And so I was like,
[00:08:15] this is what I've got to do. So when after everything unfolded and I started at McDowell, I was on a team.
[00:08:23] I came to McDowell and I joined a team. And I was only on that team for a short period of time
[00:08:29] before I realized I can do this. And I had everybody leads differently. And I had my own ideas
[00:08:37] brewing up inside. And I was like, I need to put this into action. And so I know I just went on
[00:08:46] a little side tangent. No, no, no, this is all this is all absolutely. This is so incredibly unique.
[00:08:51] I want you to I want to stay with us. This is amazing. It's just interesting to me. It's almost kind of
[00:08:57] how it all happened by happen stance. And but how it all fell together just so beautifully
[00:09:03] to give me this career that I've built and to give these agents the career that they now have.
[00:09:10] And the people that we've met along the way. And it's just I'm truly blessed for how it all unfolded.
[00:09:18] So yeah, I know I feel like I just gave a really long-winded answer there. But yeah, I joined a team.
[00:09:24] I realized very quickly, you know what? Everybody leads differently. I do have leadership qualities.
[00:09:31] So what's the worst that can happen? You know, I'm not successful at it. And so I kind of took
[00:09:37] that leap. And I started and I started with one agent. And I very slowly just grew
[00:09:43] to where we are now. I have six agents. And we are all full time top producing. And just really
[00:09:51] incredible people all the way around. Yeah, well, I hear that. And I hear it's such a unique story.
[00:09:58] I've done I think 400 plus of these. And I've not ever heard anyone say I needed to develop a team
[00:10:05] within a short period of time of not only being in the business, but also being part of someone
[00:10:10] else's team where you're like, I see what they're doing. I could maybe do this in a different way.
[00:10:14] Or in my own way. And the fact that in a time of really difficult time to be a REALTOR,
[00:10:23] like all of this is blowing my mind. It's leaving me a bit speechless. Because the results really
[00:10:30] do speak for themselves. I mean, here you are now with your five other agents or you know,
[00:10:37] and your guys are closing 100 plus homes a year. And it's not like, well, you're 20 years.
[00:10:42] In the business, and you're like, I just time for me to build a team. And I was tired of working
[00:10:46] 80 hours a week. And so I started it was like, right away, you're like, I can do this. And
[00:10:51] that's an incredible amount of confidence. And I mean that in the most sort of
[00:10:58] lovely way. Because it's just, it's you really did that on yourself. And they're really,
[00:11:03] you know, and I don't mean this in any sort of pejorative sense or critical sense. But maybe
[00:11:08] you shouldn't have even had that much confidence, right? And you made it. And that is, I love
[00:11:15] those stories. You bet on yourself. You know, I have that mentality. And sometimes it does bite me
[00:11:20] in the butt. And I'm just like, well, what's the worst that could happen? You know? And so here we are.
[00:11:25] And the worst, there's nothing bad about it. I went, I love what you just said. And I really,
[00:11:35] I know I'm sort of stuck on this point. But I think it's so important. This mindset that you have,
[00:11:39] I went and saw the filmmaker Kevin Smith speak once. And we're probably all familiar with him,
[00:11:46] or at least we know, we know the name. And whether you like his movies or not, he's definitely had
[00:11:50] an impressive career as somebody that like worked in a video store essentially. And then
[00:11:56] bet on himself and made his first movie clerks with like credit card that that was no studio
[00:12:02] would finance it. And then of course, went on to to a lot more fame. And he's still making
[00:12:05] movies today. But anyway, when I saw him speak, he said very similar thing to you to you. And
[00:12:10] this was his big message that when I saw him speak was he's like betting on yourself. There's
[00:12:16] really not much downside, right? He's like, if you don't make it, oh, well, you find something else
[00:12:21] to do. But what if you, what if you're wrong? What if you would, what if you would make it? And
[00:12:32] like that you're saying this now is just I hope our audience is taking this and is like betting on
[00:12:37] yourself might feel risky, but it's maybe not as risky as as people think. And so I applaud you for
[00:12:43] taking that leap. And obviously you're having an amazing ride. So congrats on that. Thank you.
[00:12:51] Go ahead. I was just going to say very similarly to betting on yourself, which I feel like people
[00:12:56] people need to do that. Not just in real estate, but just life in general. Just have the confidence in
[00:13:02] yourself and in your gut feeling of what you're supposed to be doing. All my life, I had been told I
[00:13:08] was, you know, bossy or at leadership skills. And it's like, yes, I know these things, but how can I
[00:13:14] get there and channel them? And when, what's that quote when preparation? It's opportunity.
[00:13:21] Needs perspiration. Yeah, something like that. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's like when everything comes
[00:13:27] to gather so divinely, just you have to trust it that everything's gonna work out in your behalf.
[00:13:34] And I think people should do that more often. Not just in business, but in life.
[00:13:38] Well, I hope are I was just going to say I'm sorry, you don't get what you don't ask for.
[00:13:43] You know, so you're not going to ask, you're not going to get it. And and failure,
[00:13:49] getting use to failure is a good thing, right? Because I'm sure as you run a team, there's probably
[00:13:53] lots of things you've tried it at, you know, with your team that work and lots of things that don't work.
[00:13:58] And I found and not in every case, but almost every release successful person I know fails a lot.
[00:14:04] Like they're just like, oh, failure's just part of the deal, but you just keep going. You get back up,
[00:14:08] you try harder. And so it's not even that failure is really the issue. It's getting up from the failure,
[00:14:14] I think. Totally. And I wouldn't even think I don't even call it failure. Right.
[00:14:19] At the right. It's growing pains. We are growing. Yes. And I'm fortunate to be surrounded by agents
[00:14:24] that have a lot of grace as we grow to trust my vision. But they can say, okay, well, this isn't working
[00:14:31] out. You know, how can we correct this? Instead of just being all up in arms, you know, we have to
[00:14:37] shift. Yeah. Yeah, pivoting and having having grace to for the imperfection of running a real
[00:14:46] estate business, whether it's an individual practitioner and they just learn their best friend,
[00:14:51] what were the different REALTOR as opposed to them. Or, you know, somebody who's running a team and
[00:14:55] maybe their top producer decides to leave and it feels, you know, it feels like, oh, this is all
[00:15:00] failure. And it's like, well, no, it's just, it's just an experience. It happens to be one that
[00:15:05] doesn't feel very good and sort of sucks. But, but it doesn't have to be the end, right? It can keep
[00:15:10] keep moving you forward. And in fact, I learned, I read this. I didn't learn it myself, but
[00:15:15] or I learned it from reading it. But it's like, we only actually learn from making mistakes. It's
[00:15:19] only really the way that we do it. So I love the fact that you took an enormous chance on yourself.
[00:15:24] And here we are. I want to talk about social media and its role in how that's helped really
[00:15:30] skyrocket your business. And you teach this as well. So this isn't just something you do. You're able
[00:15:35] to really tell agents. And I guess I want to start before we get into it with something that I
[00:15:41] rarely taught, rarely asked people about social media. And I actually was telling this before we
[00:15:46] started, I said, I got to remember to ask this because what is, and maybe it first, maybe it's a
[00:15:51] mindset thing. But how do what it, where's the biggest mistakes that you see agents making in the way
[00:15:57] they approach social media? Well, one of the biggest mistakes that I think agents make is not
[00:16:06] advertising themselves on social media. So I'm not saying don't make a post. I'm saying when I go
[00:16:11] to your page, your Facebook page, your Instagram page, how do I know that you sell real estate?
[00:16:17] If it's a picture of the sunset as your cover photo and you and your kids as your profile picture,
[00:16:24] that's beautiful. But where does it tell me that you sell real estate? We are, we need to advocate
[00:16:33] for ourselves and we need to advertise for ourselves. And so it's free. Social media is free. So why aren't
[00:16:42] we putting, you know, you'll see if you go to my Facebook page on the very top. My cover photo is
[00:16:48] my name and my phone number. And you see multiple pictures of me in real estate. You see pictures of
[00:16:54] my kids. You see things like that. But there's no question when you go to my page, what I do.
[00:17:00] And that I agree. I agree. I think there's certainly the going swinging all the way to the other
[00:17:10] direction. There's too much advertising, of course. But I think what you're saying is really important,
[00:17:17] because one of the stats that I and I might be a little off. So I apologize you may maybe
[00:17:22] be able to correct me if I'm wrong. But one of the stats that people forget or maybe don't know is
[00:17:27] especially with Facebook. And I don't know Instagram's algorithm quite as well. But people who follow you
[00:17:33] on Facebook only see like three to five percent of your posts in general. So this idea of advertising
[00:17:39] is really important because even though you put out a post saying, hey guys, I'm looking for clients
[00:17:44] or whatever. Or I just closed this home. Only a handful of your followers are even going to see that.
[00:17:50] So you do need to make a conscious effort of doing some consistent marketing and not being afraid that
[00:17:55] people are going to get so annoyed by this. Yeah, if you're doing 20 of those a day, don't do that.
[00:17:59] But or maybe do it. I don't know. But certainly don't be worried about that because Facebook is
[00:18:06] probably not going to share it with as many people as you want it to see it anyway.
[00:18:10] No, the algorithm on Facebook and Instagram on any social media platform is only a very small sliver
[00:18:19] see and I can't remember the statistic honestly, but it's
[00:18:24] I want to say it's like 30% or something like that and I could be totally wrong. I could have
[00:18:30] just made that up. That number is sticking out to me for some reason. But yeah, like you said,
[00:18:34] only a small percent of people see what you post. And so you need to be consistent in your social
[00:18:40] media posting. You're not going to get water the same day that you dig the well. But if you keep
[00:18:46] digging and you keep reminding people, you know, I, hey, I'm in real estate. Look at this closing,
[00:18:52] look at this review, look at this cool kitchen. I got to show something like that. Then you're
[00:18:57] going to stay top of mind. So you really have to be consistent. And it goes first when I go to your
[00:19:02] page, can I see what you do? Do I know your face is your brand? Where's your face? Where's your
[00:19:09] phone number? I know I don't scroll for phone numbers. You know, if I want something, if it's not
[00:19:16] right there, I'm going to find another phone number somewhere else. Yeah, make it easy for people to
[00:19:21] reach out. And that can be done like you were saying that can all be done really in the profile,
[00:19:26] the header image of a Facebook page or your own personal profile, those you're right. You
[00:19:33] should make it easy so that because and there's nothing inherently cheap about that. I know some
[00:19:39] people struggle with like, well, I'm advertising and maybe that's it's like, you know what? It's only
[00:19:44] it's only cheap if you think it's cheap. Like if you actually authentically, I'm like, I mean,
[00:19:49] look, we advertise our business. We I recruit REALTORS is for our company. All the way I advertise
[00:19:55] is we have people who make cold calls to other REALTORS. That's advertising. And if if that would
[00:20:01] have helped me on my Facebook page, I would put it on there. It's not it's not. There's nothing
[00:20:06] inherently wrong with that. Whatever your version of advertising is letting people know what you do
[00:20:11] is not bragging. It is simply telling people what you do. Yeah. 100% you're so right. It's not.
[00:20:18] Like I said, your face is your brand, the brand of your real estate business. When somebody thinks
[00:20:23] real estate, I want them to think of my face. I want them to think Courtney Hatfield. And by doing
[00:20:29] that, by posting and being consistent on social media, I recommend posting two to three times a week.
[00:20:36] Don't don't post those filler posts. Don't post the post that, you know, just because you feel like
[00:20:42] you have to post something post something that is going to post a survey. Be like, what what would
[00:20:51] you want in your dream house? You know, do you want a wine cellar? Do you want a library? Do you
[00:20:56] want to end-grant pool post, you know, get something that's going to get the people involved?
[00:21:03] Yeah. I also recommend while I recommend posting two to three times a week. I have my notes
[00:21:10] right here. So that's when I'm looking off at the side. So I can stay on track, but also posting
[00:21:13] on stories daily. What do you recommend for stories? Because agents have lots of different strategies.
[00:21:20] Some agents are like, hey, I'm at a showing or you know, listing or whatever. And I found this
[00:21:26] really cool thing in the home that I want to show you or check out this beautiful whatever. Or
[00:21:31] there's people that are like in the car on the way to the gym or you know, there's lots of
[00:21:35] different approaches. And I'm not here to say which ones work better, but I'm curious what you
[00:21:40] found works the best for you. So I keep my posts. My posts on my page are very strategic. I
[00:21:48] fake posts with faces get 30% more likes and interaction than posts without faces. So I'll post
[00:21:56] pictures of myself or my kids or whatnot clients when they close in front of their house. I'll post
[00:22:03] a picture and I'll paint the story for them. When it comes to stories, those are a little bit more,
[00:22:08] they don't have to be as thought out. If you're out to eat and you're like, look at this amazing
[00:22:12] milkshake I got and you tag the location in it. You can throw a song on there. You know, you're
[00:22:17] at a showing and look at this incredible bathroom. Oh my gosh. You know, you don't really have to
[00:22:24] put much thought behind it. I know people go live in their stories. I think that that's great. Show
[00:22:28] your face. Go live. As long as you're consistent doing it. And it was funny because I had somebody,
[00:22:35] I was I didn't post on stories for maybe a day or so. I kind of took just like a break from social
[00:22:41] media for a minute. And I had one of my agents reach out to me. She's like, how am I supposed to
[00:22:45] know like what you're up to if you're not posting on your stories? And I was like, you're right.
[00:22:49] Like people follow along and you don't realize they have but people are like, oh, Courtney didn't go
[00:22:54] to Starbucks today. What's going on? You know, if people get invested, they do. I mean, it's funny. Like,
[00:23:01] you know, this, this I for those for anyone listening who is into gaming or maybe has children
[00:23:08] that are into gaming, they there's a huge industry now. People watching other people play games or
[00:23:14] talk about playing games. And and this is something people do get invested in other people's lives.
[00:23:19] And this is a great opportunity to get people hooked on you. And so you said something really
[00:23:26] interesting. I just want to this really particular granular thing you said that was so so smart,
[00:23:30] which was look at this cool milkshake. I'm enjoying at whatever place and you can tag, of course,
[00:23:36] the place. And then in just in case they're not on top of their social media, if you know, if they,
[00:23:41] you know, well, if they are on top of their social media, they'll see it and maybe even repost it or
[00:23:46] or or sit it, set it up to their audience. Or if you don't see that, you could always message them
[00:23:51] and say, Hey, FYI, I just put this put you in a real. I wanted to support your business. Yeah. And
[00:23:57] yeah. And then that becomes an opportunity to chat with the owner or whoever is in charge.
[00:24:01] Absolutely. A few things you could do with that by being your market expert tagging your plate,
[00:24:06] tagging places in social media. So then they're going to share it. People are going to see
[00:24:13] Courtney Halfield dot REALTOR shared that post. She's a REALTOR in this area. And I've gained
[00:24:20] followers from that. I've had people message me from that. You can also one thing that I think
[00:24:25] is really neat to do is do interviews with local owners and local businesses and just draw, hey,
[00:24:34] I'm your market expert. It has doesn't not have to have anything to do with real estate.
[00:24:39] But you can I I'm going to take over the interview for two for 30 seconds because Courtney just
[00:24:46] Courtney, I'm so sorry, but I I am such a big fan of what Courtney saying. So I apologize
[00:24:51] for jumping on top of this one, but I love this so much. So Courtney just gave everybody a literally
[00:24:57] a a strategy you could do every single week, find a local business in your area that you love
[00:25:03] and support and that you want to see succeed. And you have to think about it. Now we're going to
[00:25:08] switch to the business owners perspective. They're getting phone calls constantly from people wanting
[00:25:12] them to spend money on marketing efforts, right? Whether it's print ads, radio, you know, internet
[00:25:17] ads, whatever it might be. It's all about can we get more money out of the owner so that they can
[00:25:22] get more business? You're basically saying I want to give you a free shout out to everyone who follows me.
[00:25:28] And can I do a quick can I come down to your thing and do a quick like two minute interview or
[00:25:32] ten minute interview about why you started this business? There is never going to be somebody that says
[00:25:37] no to that like, Oh, and I don't and of course I don't charge. It's just something I do and
[00:25:43] oh my god, it's so incredibly brilliant. It's just a great way for you to be in the media. So when
[00:25:50] people think of you, the goal is to get people to think of you as their source of information
[00:25:58] for your town. It doesn't just have to be real estate related. And so you can go to the dance studio
[00:26:05] and you can say, Oh, this dance studio has classes Monday, Tuesday, Thursday and they're offering
[00:26:11] a special this month. This is the owner, Billy Bob, you know, and he is on this 37 years and just
[00:26:18] really expand on that. They will show the video. You can show the video to different, you know,
[00:26:25] if you have a city Facebook page, I know I know those exist, you know, a county Facebook page
[00:26:30] and you can just get your face everywhere. Just by that. I'm pausing you know because you just
[00:26:37] said another amazing thing. So because I live in a little neighborhood called Wicker Park, we have a
[00:26:42] Wicker Park community group and and we're all you know what, you know what most of the posts are either
[00:26:47] there's a lost cat or dog at somebody wants to find other than that. It's does anyone have a good
[00:26:52] recommendation for an Indian restaurant or whatever a hairdresser or doctor or whatever. So
[00:26:59] you pretty just said this amazing thing. You you go interview the the business that you want to
[00:27:04] support. Whatever it is doesn't matter what it is. Just something that you are really into. And then
[00:27:09] you absolutely have a community page somewhere online on Facebook or there's other places too.
[00:27:15] But and then post it there and then oh, by the way, they've learned that Courtney the REALTOR is
[00:27:19] putting this out. That's amazing. Yeah. You're their market expert. That's it. That's how you
[00:27:25] want to brand yourself with your face in on social media. Oh, I love that. With social media that I
[00:27:34] I like to drill like drill in on is going live. So people are uncomfortable. They don't like going
[00:27:43] live in front of the camera. It's not for you. It's for other people. So when you go live and you're
[00:27:51] at a showing or you're at an open house or you're at you know we have a a theater downtown where I live
[00:27:58] going live there and saying I'm live here with this Beatles tribute band. And just those things won't
[00:28:05] go into your won't go into your feed. They won't go onto your profile but they're going to go in your
[00:28:09] stories. And it looks like you're everywhere all the time. And this has nothing to do with anything
[00:28:15] I just said. But when you're posting in your stories, people don't need to know that you're actually
[00:28:23] you know on your couch ordering a pizza, you know watching a movie. It looks like out and about.
[00:28:29] It looks like you're constantly going. Yes. And perceptions important. It is. It is. So if you look
[00:28:36] like you're everywhere and you're involved in everything and you dabble in everything, people will
[00:28:40] say, oh Courtney's done this. She's been here. And then they'll come to me. And it just
[00:28:46] builds that relationship. And you're also providing value because like by the way Beatles are my
[00:28:51] favorite band of all time. So I will always go see a Beatles tribute band. But but the but what you
[00:28:57] says is really important because whether you're actually at the event or you're just promoting the
[00:29:01] event saying, Hey, Beatles fans, there's this there's a Beatles thing tonight. Like that's that's
[00:29:06] still incredible value to people. They're like, wow, Courtney really knows what's going on.
[00:29:10] Whether you're there dancing or or not even able to attend this idea of providing value
[00:29:17] even outside of real estate, just saying like, I know what's going on because this is my community.
[00:29:21] I work in this community. Oh, brilliant. We're talking about branding now really. We're talking
[00:29:26] about this idea. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, my gosh. Nobody needs to know you're on your couch near pajamas.
[00:29:33] Like you're providing value. That's literally what our job is to do is to provide value.
[00:29:38] Be a market resource. Be people. Be there. Go to person. And that will eventually you don't get
[00:29:45] water the same day. You take the while it will turn into clients. It will turn into referrals.
[00:29:50] I've seen this time and time again in my own business. And we've only been in business,
[00:29:55] you know, a few years. Unbelieve. What percentage of your business comes from social media?
[00:30:00] No, I mean, just a general idea of, I want to pause for a moment to talk about our episode sponsor
[00:30:07] are one of my favorite companies out there. Follow up boss. Now, after interviewing hundreds of
[00:30:12] top REALTORS in the country for this podcast, do you know which CRM is used by more than any other

[00:31:21] boss. And now back to our episode. My personal business is all social media. Everything that I do,
[00:31:29] I we do get leads on the team, but I don't take I don't take leads. I pass those out. Sure. So all
[00:31:35] of my last year, I just social media referrals. I had 30 I close 30 transactions. Amazing. That's
[00:31:43] amazing. So this idea, how long did it see you talked about? Yeah, look, you know, we're this is a
[00:31:51] marathon, not a sprint. You post once and then nothing happens. And you're like, well, that didn't
[00:31:57] work. And it's like, no, it probably did work. It's just not how people make decisions about about
[00:32:02] their biggest one of their biggest assets. If not their biggest asset, they need to get comfortable.
[00:32:07] It's going to take time at the followers, the followership is going to grow. How long did it take
[00:32:12] before you started seeing results on social? It was probably maybe a year and a half or two years
[00:32:22] into consistently posting that I really started to get. And you'll see in the packet in the PDF
[00:32:29] that I am going to share with everybody, you'll see examples of people saying, hey, do you have
[00:32:36] a business card or phone number? I can share with my ex husband, he's on the hunt for a house.
[00:32:42] Courtney Hathfield, 100%. She's amazing and local to the Canton area, one of the nicest ladies,
[00:32:48] you'll ever meet. And I share a ton of screenshots. Just proof that this does work. If you keep
[00:32:56] putting in the time, putting, you know, it takes time. It does take time. I'm very authentic in what I
[00:33:02] post. I'm not, it's not everything is curated. It's right now you'll look at my Instagram and I just
[00:33:09] bought a house and I'm redoing it and just little projects. And so you'll see a bunch of reels of me,
[00:33:15] you know, attempting different projects. It's what's really happening in my life.
[00:33:20] And I get comments on there that people are like, I can't wait to see how this turns out. And,
[00:33:24] you know, it keeps people in the loop. So they may not need me for real estate right now. But if they
[00:33:28] want to redo their fireplace, they can call me, you know, yeah, still providing that value, even
[00:33:33] those very authentic to who I am. And, and, and they might, they might be doing their fireplace and
[00:33:39] going, you know, we don't know the right masonry guy or the architected or the contractor, like,
[00:33:44] we should ask Courtney because I know I've been following her and this is what she's up to.
[00:33:49] I love that. I love that. That is really, really smart. And I don't know that anyone's ever
[00:33:54] really talked about that in that way on the show. So I appreciate you going into that detail. And
[00:33:58] I'm a marketer. So I just absolutely love this conversation. And it's so funny because what we're
[00:34:03] not talking about necessarily is how to hone your actual skills as a REALTOR, which you absolutely
[00:34:09] should be doing on top of that. But I think agents focus on that quite a lot, which they should. And
[00:34:15] they often neglect this, this marathon, like you were saying, one and a half to two years before
[00:34:20] you saw results on social. That is not a fun ride, right? Like that is a, that is a, it's a grind
[00:34:27] that you just have to trust is eventually going to pay off. And it's just like this podcast.
[00:34:32] Nobody listened to this podcast for the first year and I have nobody cared about it. And took
[00:34:37] you took that long before anyone even noticed it. So I am right with you. Right. You have, you have
[00:34:43] to put it in the time. I'm weary about instant success. So every day that I'm like, are we still like
[00:34:49] a top producing team? You know what I mean? I still question how, how I just question it because
[00:34:56] I feel like instant success, there's something to be said about it. But we really have, you have to
[00:35:01] put in the work and we really have to get where we are. Social media, I do recommend. So what I,
[00:35:09] my method on social media is I pick five topics to post about. And they are real estate related.
[00:35:17] And I can fly through those real quick just to make it. So the first thing I post are pictures
[00:35:25] of myself because like I said, photos of faces get more, they get more engagement than photos of
[00:35:31] like, I don't know, a sunset. Then I post work, new listing, sold listings, reviews, market news,
[00:35:38] and team news. And anytime I post team news, I am a big fan of giving credit where it's due.
[00:35:46] So I am tagging the entire team. It's not about me. It's about them. This is their businesses that
[00:35:52] we are trying to grow. And so I will tag every single person. So now what I just posted about your
[00:35:58] home court team ends up on six different Facebook pages or Instagram pages or Instagram stories.
[00:36:05] And our brand grows from there. I'm a big big advocate of posting reviews. You should absolutely
[00:36:13] don't post a one star review. But if you've got a five star review, then you should absolutely post it.
[00:36:19] If you sold a million dollar house, it doesn't matter if you sold that house last July,
[00:36:24] you still sold that million dollar house. So post it. At keep posting it post, you know, different
[00:36:31] like different photos of it because you are a million dollar agent now. You sold that.
[00:36:36] And you could even every year on the home anniversary say congratulations to so-and-so who purchased
[00:36:43] or sold this home a year ago. So much fun working with you. You know, could be something like that.
[00:36:48] And tag them. Absolutely. Absolutely. Yes. The third thing I post, I post my kids. And I always
[00:36:57] try to make it business related. So my daughter had career day at school. She's six. She wanted to
[00:37:01] dress up like me for career day. So she put on her earrings. She put on her sweatshirt. That says,
[00:37:06] your home court team. She carried her purse. And she carried a little coffee mug. And that's what she
[00:37:12] went to school. And I posted the picture. And everybody loved it. Where I'll put the cutest thing I've
[00:37:18] ever heard. It was it was like, well, she had my business cards in her little, she had a little
[00:37:23] fake Louis Vuitton purse. And she put her business cards in there. And she took them. And I was like,
[00:37:26] pass those babies out like get them everywhere. So I also put the pictures of that or her in front of
[00:37:35] a listing sign. You know, pretending like she sold it. Just. Oh, that's great. I love that.
[00:37:42] Different ideas to kind of bring it. It's still business related, but it's still personal to me.
[00:37:47] Sure. I'll post quotes. I do like sales quotes. And funny, the quotes that I see get the most
[00:37:56] interaction or saves on Instagram are quotes about money. And I. Interesting. Yeah.
[00:38:05] I've never I've never even spoken about this with anybody because that's just like one of those.
[00:38:09] You look at your insights and you're like, oh, okay. But I've noticed quotes about money,
[00:38:14] financial freedom, things like that. Those get the most saves and shares on Instagram, which I
[00:38:18] thought was. So I've ramped up sharing those. Well, everybody wants more money, right? So I think
[00:38:24] that's makes sense. Yeah. Absolutely. It yeah, it does. And then I post I. I like doing DIYs.
[00:38:35] So I that is my fifth thing that I post our DIY videos of the house or I'm a big thrifter or
[00:38:42] something that I found a good will or all post things like that. Very authentic to me brings
[00:38:46] in a different type of audience. Sure. But it's the engagement and they know that I'm a real
[00:38:52] sure on the meantime. Well, and I want to point out something about the DIY crowd because DIY
[00:38:57] crowd is online. This is where they're learning oftentimes how to do some of their DIY projects.
[00:39:04] So this this is also like going where your audience is. Yes, it may be it's a different audience than
[00:39:09] than who was more attracted to other posts of yours. But that's the whole point is you have different
[00:39:13] different sort of categories for different types of clients. And this idea of DIY people are
[00:39:19] always looking for inspiration ideas and instruction. So that is I've never heard anyone talk about
[00:39:25] that. That's really smart. It's it's home. It's you know, we sell homes for a living. So people,
[00:39:30] what do they want to do? They want to renovate their home or they want to update it in some way.
[00:39:35] And so I just post my personal DIY projects and products that I got things like that. And I mean,
[00:39:42] like I said, it's a different following, but it's it's very in line with what I do.
[00:39:48] I love them. You have given us so many great. I'm sorry. Did we hit all five of your topics because
[00:39:53] I will okay good because I am I just know you were you were wonderful
[00:40:00] I lose track of things because I get so excited with with a lot of these ideas and I'm realizing as a
[00:40:07] was so funny. So this is this is Courtney. It was kind enough not to scold me, but she she probably
[00:40:13] should have because she said to me before we started do you guys have Instagram and I'm like not
[00:40:18] really for the podcast. And I was like how stupid are we that we don't have Instagram yet. And I've
[00:40:23] had about lots of people talk about social media in the past. So this is my challenge to myself to take
[00:40:28] my own advice or Courtney's advice rather. And I'm going to commit to starting to post more
[00:40:34] regularly about the podcast as well as our own business for recruiting REALTORS. But you are
[00:40:41] absolutely right. And you're getting all of your business through social that is in the same.
[00:40:47] Yes, that one thing. And I know we talked about something mistakes agents make on social media.
[00:40:52] Yeah. Politics.
[00:40:57] COVID, you know, religion issues that yeah, religion, things that we are we're not in the market to debate.
[00:41:06] We're in the market to sell houses. So let's if somebody you know if I vote for somebody and
[00:41:13] somebody else votes for somebody, I'm not going to not sell them house. They didn't vote for the
[00:41:17] person I wanted. You know, I don't care who they voted for. I care that they, you know, used me to
[00:41:23] buy their house. So I just keep all of that separate. You'll never find a single thing on my page
[00:41:28] about anything political. Well, it's just going to polarize. It'll polarize an alienate a certain group.
[00:41:35] And you're as a business owner, I guess there's I guess a strategy of like if I polarize one side,
[00:41:42] maybe the other side comes. I don't know. It seems like a very risky strategy. I would rather
[00:41:46] let everybody want to work with it. Yeah. 100% and I am shocked by how many agents I see that are just so
[00:41:55] like rude about it on Facebook or Instagram. More so Facebook. But I'm just like, oh my gosh,
[00:42:01] just don't stop talking. Yeah, I'm a big fan of the the REALTOR community lab code agents, which is
[00:42:08] I think the largest REALTOR community online. And it's wonderful. And there's so much value there.
[00:42:12] And I love Tristan and those guys. They're lovely. They've been on my show. But you're right. Like
[00:42:16] and this is just a REALTOR thing that other people wouldn't necessarily see. But there's a lot of like,
[00:42:21] you know, a brokerage has, you know, layoffs or something bad happens to a brokerage. And there
[00:42:27] is a lot of brokers out there who are like, thank God, so and so is going down and I'm just,
[00:42:33] it's just it's an incredible amount. And I go, I wonder what they're posting on their own public
[00:42:38] stuff. If you know, they're willing to sort, it's very strange. So don't really make people.
[00:42:44] Exactly. There's enough sun to shine for every single person. And you know what? I kind of feel like
[00:42:49] if you were not, if you used your time better, maybe, like, maybe you should be selling a house
[00:42:56] instead of complaining on Facebook, you know, right. Yeah, you're right. And people who, you know,
[00:43:04] just being really conscious about the about your image and that's not a bad thing. It's called
[00:43:09] branding. It's really important. It's funny. I like we're starting I'm starting another podcast
[00:43:14] unreal estate related for non real estate related for for an organization. And as a result, I'm just
[00:43:20] interviewing people for this particular nonprofit. Yeah. And it has nothing to do with me, but someone
[00:43:24] has to be the podcast host. And so I had to really think that even though I don't speak for the
[00:43:29] organization, I'm not on their board of directors. I'm I'm I'm part of the community of this
[00:43:34] organization, but I'm not their main person. But it's going to come across that I'm the main person
[00:43:39] because I'm going to be doing this podcast. And I had to realize, okay, it's important for me not
[00:43:44] to insert myself into this new podcast because I don't I don't speak for this brand, but you speak
[00:43:51] for your own brand. And on this show, I can be as you know, obnoxious as I want because it's my own
[00:43:55] brand. But but you're absolutely right is is really being aware that, you know, every time you post
[00:44:01] it's permanent, it's forever. And you know, maybe people should be more conscious of what their
[00:44:07] brand is because their clients are going to look them up. They they really are. Yeah, just be very
[00:44:13] careful what you put on and what you're willing. Some people that's a hill they're willing to
[00:44:17] die on. So all right, I'll take the clients you don't want. I love that. And and also I said this
[00:44:24] at the beginning, but I sort of said it quickly. Courtney is being generous enough to provide a a
[00:44:29] guide for our audience to really help them understand best practices around social media marketing.
[00:44:35] We're going to make that available. It's in the show notes. It's a PDF super easy to get and really
[00:44:40] will help you start your journey there. What do you tell agents of people that that you speak to
[00:44:46] about doing more on social if they're afraid to sort of turn the camera on themselves? If there is
[00:44:52] a fear of, I don't really, you know, it's hard for me to expose. Maybe, you know, there's just a lot
[00:44:59] of people aren't comfortable in front of a camera. I know I'm not. They are. I'm not either, but a lot
[00:45:04] of people are and some agents on my team aren't comfortable with it. And a lot of the time, it
[00:45:09] really just takes practice. It just takes practice. Honestly, there are nobody's thinking about what
[00:45:17] you look like when you send them that video. They're listening to what you have to say. And people
[00:45:22] look too far into it. They really do. So, you know, I, it just takes practice. Stand in front of a mirror,
[00:45:31] record yourself a few times. One thing that I have told my team is instead, so let's say they make
[00:45:38] connection with a new lead. Send that person a video and say it was so nice to talk to you. I can't
[00:45:51] do it. Make a video of your face. And send it to them. It's so much better than, hey, this is Courtney
[00:45:59] Hatfield, you know, it was such a pleasure. And being, you know, sending them a text message. That's
[00:46:04] so much more generic. Anybody can send a text message. What makes this different? Let's send a video
[00:46:08] message. So, so I want to, I want to drill down on this for a moment because I want to make sure I
[00:46:13] understand the process because this is brilliant. So, let's say you're at an open house, you get a
[00:46:18] list of people that have come in and now at the end of the open house, you now have names and phone
[00:46:23] numbers and email addresses of people to follow up with who maybe they're not going to buy the home,
[00:46:27] but maybe they're, you know, you could show them other properties. So, are, so you're saying make a
[00:46:32] video for those people as well? Yes. And how, how do you send that? I'm sorry. How do you distribute that
[00:46:39] to them? Just through a text platform. We use follow up boss. So I send my stuff through follow up
[00:46:46] boss. But you follow a boss. There are, there are, there are sponsor of ours. So we love follow up
[00:46:50] boss. Yeah. Shame on there you go. I, yeah. But you're right. You're right. We all have phones that
[00:46:57] can easily do this turn around. Hey, it was so good meeting you with the open house. I love it.
[00:47:01] That's, that's all it is. And I just flip my camera around. I take a video. It was so nice to
[00:47:05] meet you guys at the open house. I know this home wasn't for you, but I'm going to go into home and
[00:47:09] send you some options that might be looking forward to working with you. Then they see your face again,
[00:47:16] they're more apt to respond like we said, faces, get more interaction, then just a generic text
[00:47:22] message that anybody can type of a text message. Sure, anybody can send a video, but not everybody will.
[00:47:28] In fact, almost nobody will. Exactly. And it's just really, it's just really, it makes you stand out
[00:47:36] against your competition. It does. And it shows that you are willing to go a little bit further,
[00:47:42] maybe than other REALTORS to sort of earn the business. I guess not even win the business
[00:47:47] earn it. I think you do have to earn it. And I think earning it is through showing people that
[00:47:52] you're willing to work, work for them and making a video shows, I mean, again, it's, it's just a great,
[00:47:59] great idea. Now, I'm going to, we're going to put a cap on this episode because Courtney's given
[00:48:04] so much of herself in this episode that I think our audience is like madly scribbling notes about
[00:48:10] what they can do because this is incredible. And Courtney has got to go because they're probably
[00:48:15] closing a home later today. So I'm going to, I'm going to, I'm going to do this. And I want to have
[00:48:20] you back in the future to even give more, more and more tips, but you've given us a solid hour
[00:48:24] of unbelievable tips and advice for social media. I am so, so grateful to have had you on our show.
[00:48:32] And I want to make, make a point that if there are any REALTORS out there who are maybe in the,
[00:48:36] the Cleveland or surrounding areas, Akron areas, well, you know, and you're looking to maybe
[00:48:42] join a team, you know, you never know reach out to Courtney and see if she might be a good fit,
[00:48:47] or you might be a good fit for her team. And by the way, maybe you're just somebody who's looking
[00:48:51] for a REALTOR to either your REALTOR in another area and you have somebody moving to that area,
[00:48:56] or that, you know, you're not a REALTOR and you found our podcast and you want to work with
[00:49:00] somebody like Courtney. And by the way, if you live in those areas, you absolutely should,
[00:49:04] you know, what's the best way that someone should reach out to you?
[00:49:07] You can find me on Facebook, Courtney Hatfield, or you can find me on Instagram,
[00:49:13] Courtney Hatfield.REALTOR, all one word. I'm on all the social media. You can find me anywhere.
[00:49:19] Courtney Hatfield. And and all of those links will be in the show notes if you're listening to this
[00:49:24] through a podcast app. And also remember to download her PDF of some best social media practices
[00:49:30] that she was so kind to to provide to our audience. And Courtney, on behalf of our audience,
[00:49:36] we really drank from the fire hose today. And so I am, my head is spinning a bit and I am about
[00:49:41] to start to put some some things into action for our own podcast here and my own real estate
[00:49:47] business or the world's business I work for so that I can get better results on social. So I
[00:49:52] want to check back in with you shortly and and I get you back on the show. So on behalf of the
[00:49:57] audience, you provided incredible values. So thank you. And I know how busy you are. So thank you
[00:50:01] on top of that. And also, we appreciate it so much. And also on behalf of Courtney and myself,

[00:50:22] better social media presence and send them a link to this episode. The best way you can
[00:50:26] have introduced someone to us, just send to our website, keeping it real pod.com or just have them

So Courtney, welcome to the show. Well, thank you for having me. I really appreciate it. I am a long time listener. I just look into an episode this morning on the way to work. Wow. Well, I am so honored to hear that and really grateful to have you on the podcast as well because you have what you and your team have accomplished in a relatively short amount of time is just nothing more than incredible. But before we get to sort of the present day, I'd love to start at the beginning. So can you tell us a little bit about why you got into real estate and how you got into real estate? Absolutely. So I got into real estate truly by half in stance in 2018. It was a family decision. My husband's family owned a brokerage at the time. And you know, I was a stay at home mom and I was bored. I was actually spending more money as a stay at home mom out of boredom that my husband was like, you need to go do something. So I was like, well, what if I go into the family business? And I did. And I I loved it from the start. I had a slow start with it though because right after I got my license, my husband's uncle who was the broker actually was diagnosed with cancer. And he ended up passing away a year later. So it wasn't really until 2019 that I really hit the ground running with my career. And I chose McDowell Homes. I interviewed a few different brokerages, but they were one of the smaller boutique independent brokerages in Cleveland. And I really loved their culture and what they stood for. It was a good fit. And that's just really where I've made myself a home. And I decided to start our team here. And so over the last three years, I've just really poured myself into this, you know, this baby that I created your home court team. And here we are. Well, you are killing it. And I think we want to just maybe remind everyone that you've only been really been practicing for, you know, a handful of years. And you started right when COVID was happening. So the fact that you started and again on the heels of a tragedy and my condolences for that. But also, disability to start at, you know, tragedy aside, just COVID. It's its own tragedy, of course. And what it did to, you know, to agents and their production and everyone was, was obviously struggling as agents to produce. And of course, last year was was a pretty good year for a lot of agents because there was a lot more activity as we were all getting back to some degree of normalcy. But to then, but this, you know, just to be able to to start at this pretty challenging time is incredible. And how did you, how did you know to create it? Did you create a team right away? Or were you already sort of chugging along yourself and sort of needed help? Or what was the, how was the decision made for that? So I will say, with the one thing that I really took away, besides the opportunity that I got from my husband's uncle when I came on to the family brokerage, was I remember him. He had just missed a phone call. And I was sitting at the desk and I was just kind of like watching him because I was new and I didn't know what I was doing. And it, in my mind, I was like, Oh, well, he has time to call that person back. But literally he would just miss it. And he was already dialing the person back. And I was like, Oh, my gosh, that's the type of hustle that I need. And I knew that I had it like buried down in me. And so I was like, this is what I've got to do. So when after everything unfolded and I started at McDowell, I was on a team. I came to McDowell and I joined a team. And I was only on that team for a short period of time before I realized I can do this. And I had everybody leads differently. And I had my own ideas brewing up inside. And I was like, I need to put this into action. And so I know I just went on a little side tangent. No, no, no, this is all this is all absolutely. This is so incredibly unique. I want you to I want to stay with us. This is amazing. It's just interesting to me. It's almost kind of how it all happened by happen stance. And but how it all fell together just so beautifully to give me this career that I've built and to give these agents the career that they now have. And the people that we've met along the way. And it's just I'm truly blessed for how it all unfolded. So yeah, I know I feel like I just gave a really long-winded answer there. But yeah, I joined a team. I realized very quickly, you know what? Everybody leads differently. I do have leadership qualities. So what's the worst that can happen? You know, I'm not successful at it. And so I kind of took that leap. And I started and I started with one agent. And I very slowly just grew to where we are now. I have six agents. And we are all full time top producing. And just really incredible people all the way around. Yeah, well, I hear that. And I hear it's such a unique story. I've done I think 400 plus of these. And I've not ever heard anyone say I needed to develop a team within a short period of time of not only being in the business, but also being part of someone else's team where you're like, I see what they're doing. I could maybe do this in a different way. Or in my own way. And the fact that in a time of really difficult time to be a REALTOR, like all of this is blowing my mind. It's leaving me a bit speechless. Because the results really do speak for themselves. I mean, here you are now with your five other agents or you know, and your guys are closing 100 plus homes a year. And it's not like, well, you're 20 years. In the business, and you're like, I just time for me to build a team. And I was tired of working 80 hours a week. And so I started it was like, right away, you're like, I can do this. And that's an incredible amount of confidence. And I mean that in the most sort of lovely way. Because it's just, it's you really did that on yourself. And they're really, you know, and I don't mean this in any sort of pejorative sense or critical sense. But maybe you shouldn't have even had that much confidence, right? And you made it. And that is, I love those stories. You bet on yourself. You know, I have that mentality. And sometimes it does bite me in the butt. And I'm just like, well, what's the worst that could happen? You know? And so here we are. And the worst, there's nothing bad about it. I went, I love what you just said. And I really, I know I'm sort of stuck on this point. But I think it's so important. This mindset that you have, I went and saw the filmmaker Kevin Smith speak once. And we're probably all familiar with him, or at least we know, we know the name. And whether you like his movies or not, he's definitely had an impressive career as somebody that like worked in a video store essentially. And then bet on himself and made his first movie clerks with like credit card that that was no studio would finance it. And then of course, went on to to a lot more fame. And he's still making movies today. But anyway, when I saw him speak, he said very similar thing to you to you. And this was his big message that when I saw him speak was he's like betting on yourself. There's really not much downside, right? He's like, if you don't make it, oh, well, you find something else to do. But what if you, what if you're wrong? What if you would, what if you would make it? And like that you're saying this now is just I hope our audience is taking this and is like betting on yourself might feel risky, but it's maybe not as risky as as people think. And so I applaud you for taking that leap. And obviously you're having an amazing ride. So congrats on that. Thank you. Go ahead. I was just going to say very similarly to betting on yourself, which I feel like people people need to do that. Not just in real estate, but just life in general. Just have the confidence in yourself and in your gut feeling of what you're supposed to be doing. All my life, I had been told I was, you know, bossy or at leadership skills. And it's like, yes, I know these things, but how can I get there and channel them? And when, what's that quote when preparation? It's opportunity. Needs perspiration. Yeah, something like that. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's like when everything comes to gather so divinely, just you have to trust it that everything's gonna work out in your behalf. And I think people should do that more often. Not just in business, but in life. Well, I hope are I was just going to say I'm sorry, you don't get what you don't ask for. You know, so you're not going to ask, you're not going to get it. And and failure, getting use to failure is a good thing, right? Because I'm sure as you run a team, there's probably lots of things you've tried it at, you know, with your team that work and lots of things that don't work. And I found and not in every case, but almost every release successful person I know fails a lot. Like they're just like, oh, failure's just part of the deal, but you just keep going. You get back up, you try harder. And so it's not even that failure is really the issue. It's getting up from the failure, I think. Totally. And I wouldn't even think I don't even call it failure. Right. At the right. It's growing pains. We are growing. Yes. And I'm fortunate to be surrounded by agents that have a lot of grace as we grow to trust my vision. But they can say, okay, well, this isn't working out. You know, how can we correct this? Instead of just being all up in arms, you know, we have to shift. Yeah. Yeah, pivoting and having having grace to for the imperfection of running a real estate business, whether it's an individual practitioner and they just learn their best friend, what were the different REALTOR as opposed to them. Or, you know, somebody who's running a team and maybe their top producer decides to leave and it feels, you know, it feels like, oh, this is all failure. And it's like, well, no, it's just, it's just an experience. It happens to be one that doesn't feel very good and sort of sucks. But, but it doesn't have to be the end, right? It can keep keep moving you forward. And in fact, I learned, I read this. I didn't learn it myself, but or I learned it from reading it. But it's like, we only actually learn from making mistakes. It's only really the way that we do it. So I love the fact that you took an enormous chance on yourself. And here we are. I want to talk about social media and its role in how that's helped really skyrocket your business. And you teach this as well. So this isn't just something you do. You're able to really tell agents. And I guess I want to start before we get into it with something that I rarely taught, rarely asked people about social media. And I actually was telling this before we started, I said, I got to remember to ask this because what is, and maybe it first, maybe it's a mindset thing. But how do what it, where's the biggest mistakes that you see agents making in the way they approach social media? Well, one of the biggest mistakes that I think agents make is not advertising themselves on social media. So I'm not saying don't make a post. I'm saying when I go to your page, your Facebook page, your Instagram page, how do I know that you sell real estate? If it's a picture of the sunset as your cover photo and you and your kids as your profile picture, that's beautiful. But where does it tell me that you sell real estate? We are, we need to advocate for ourselves and we need to advertise for ourselves. And so it's free. Social media is free. So why aren't we putting, you know, you'll see if you go to my Facebook page on the very top. My cover photo is my name and my phone number. And you see multiple pictures of me in real estate. You see pictures of my kids. You see things like that. But there's no question when you go to my page, what I do. And that I agree. I agree. I think there's certainly the going swinging all the way to the other direction. There's too much advertising, of course. But I think what you're saying is really important, because one of the stats that I and I might be a little off. So I apologize you may maybe be able to correct me if I'm wrong. But one of the stats that people forget or maybe don't know is especially with Facebook. And I don't know Instagram's algorithm quite as well. But people who follow you on Facebook only see like three to five percent of your posts in general. So this idea of advertising is really important because even though you put out a post saying, hey guys, I'm looking for clients or whatever. Or I just closed this home. Only a handful of your followers are even going to see that. So you do need to make a conscious effort of doing some consistent marketing and not being afraid that people are going to get so annoyed by this. Yeah, if you're doing 20 of those a day, don't do that. But or maybe do it. I don't know. But certainly don't be worried about that because Facebook is probably not going to share it with as many people as you want it to see it anyway. No, the algorithm on Facebook and Instagram on any social media platform is only a very small sliver see and I can't remember the statistic honestly, but it's I want to say it's like 30% or something like that and I could be totally wrong. I could have just made that up. That number is sticking out to me for some reason. But yeah, like you said, only a small percent of people see what you post. And so you need to be consistent in your social media posting. You're not going to get water the same day that you dig the well. But if you keep digging and you keep reminding people, you know, I, hey, I'm in real estate. Look at this closing, look at this review, look at this cool kitchen. I got to show something like that. Then you're going to stay top of mind. So you really have to be consistent. And it goes first when I go to your page, can I see what you do? Do I know your face is your brand? Where's your face? Where's your phone number? I know I don't scroll for phone numbers. You know, if I want something, if it's not right there, I'm going to find another phone number somewhere else. Yeah, make it easy for people to reach out. And that can be done like you were saying that can all be done really in the profile, the header image of a Facebook page or your own personal profile, those you're right. You should make it easy so that because and there's nothing inherently cheap about that. I know some people struggle with like, well, I'm advertising and maybe that's it's like, you know what? It's only it's only cheap if you think it's cheap. Like if you actually authentically, I'm like, I mean, look, we advertise our business. We I recruit REALTORS is for our company. All the way I advertise is we have people who make cold calls to other REALTORS. That's advertising. And if if that would have helped me on my Facebook page, I would put it on there. It's not it's not. There's nothing inherently wrong with that. Whatever your version of advertising is letting people know what you do is not bragging. It is simply telling people what you do. Yeah. 100% you're so right. It's not. Like I said, your face is your brand, the brand of your real estate business. When somebody thinks real estate, I want them to think of my face. I want them to think Courtney Hatfield. And by doing that, by posting and being consistent on social media, I recommend posting two to three times a week. Don't don't post those filler posts. Don't post the post that, you know, just because you feel like you have to post something post something that is going to post a survey. Be like, what what would you want in your dream house? You know, do you want a wine cellar? Do you want a library? Do you want to end-grant pool post, you know, get something that's going to get the people involved? Yeah. I also recommend while I recommend posting two to three times a week. I have my notes right here. So that's when I'm looking off at the side. So I can stay on track, but also posting on stories daily. What do you recommend for stories? Because agents have lots of different strategies. Some agents are like, hey, I'm at a showing or you know, listing or whatever. And I found this really cool thing in the home that I want to show you or check out this beautiful whatever. Or there's people that are like in the car on the way to the gym or you know, there's lots of different approaches. And I'm not here to say which ones work better, but I'm curious what you found works the best for you. So I keep my posts. My posts on my page are very strategic. I fake posts with faces get 30% more likes and interaction than posts without faces. So I'll post pictures of myself or my kids or whatnot clients when they close in front of their house. I'll post a picture and I'll paint the story for them. When it comes to stories, those are a little bit more, they don't have to be as thought out. If you're out to eat and you're like, look at this amazing milkshake I got and you tag the location in it. You can throw a song on there. You know, you're at a showing and look at this incredible bathroom. Oh my gosh. You know, you don't really have to put much thought behind it. I know people go live in their stories. I think that that's great. Show your face. Go live. As long as you're consistent doing it. And it was funny because I had somebody, I was I didn't post on stories for maybe a day or so. I kind of took just like a break from social media for a minute. And I had one of my agents reach out to me. She's like, how am I supposed to know like what you're up to if you're not posting on your stories? And I was like, you're right. Like people follow along and you don't realize they have but people are like, oh, Courtney didn't go to Starbucks today. What's going on? You know, if people get invested, they do. I mean, it's funny. Like, you know, this, this I for those for anyone listening who is into gaming or maybe has children that are into gaming, they there's a huge industry now. People watching other people play games or talk about playing games. And and this is something people do get invested in other people's lives. And this is a great opportunity to get people hooked on you. And so you said something really interesting. I just want to this really particular granular thing you said that was so so smart, which was look at this cool milkshake. I'm enjoying at whatever place and you can tag, of course, the place. And then in just in case they're not on top of their social media, if you know, if they, you know, well, if they are on top of their social media, they'll see it and maybe even repost it or or or sit it, set it up to their audience. Or if you don't see that, you could always message them and say, Hey, FYI, I just put this put you in a real. I wanted to support your business. Yeah. And yeah. And then that becomes an opportunity to chat with the owner or whoever is in charge. Absolutely. A few things you could do with that by being your market expert tagging your plate, tagging places in social media. So then they're going to share it. People are going to see Courtney Halfield dot REALTOR shared that post. She's a REALTOR in this area. And I've gained followers from that. I've had people message me from that. You can also one thing that I think is really neat to do is do interviews with local owners and local businesses and just draw, hey, I'm your market expert. It has doesn't not have to have anything to do with real estate. But you can I I'm going to take over the interview for two for 30 seconds because Courtney just Courtney, I'm so sorry, but I I am such a big fan of what Courtney saying. So I apologize for jumping on top of this one, but I love this so much. So Courtney just gave everybody a literally a a strategy you could do every single week, find a local business in your area that you love and support and that you want to see succeed. And you have to think about it. Now we're going to switch to the business owners perspective. They're getting phone calls constantly from people wanting them to spend money on marketing efforts, right? Whether it's print ads, radio, you know, internet ads, whatever it might be. It's all about can we get more money out of the owner so that they can get more business? You're basically saying I want to give you a free shout out to everyone who follows me. And can I do a quick can I come down to your thing and do a quick like two minute interview or ten minute interview about why you started this business? There is never going to be somebody that says no to that like, Oh, and I don't and of course I don't charge. It's just something I do and oh my god, it's so incredibly brilliant. It's just a great way for you to be in the media. So when people think of you, the goal is to get people to think of you as their source of information for your town. It doesn't just have to be real estate related. And so you can go to the dance studio and you can say, Oh, this dance studio has classes Monday, Tuesday, Thursday and they're offering a special this month. This is the owner, Billy Bob, you know, and he is on this 37 years and just really expand on that. They will show the video. You can show the video to different, you know, if you have a city Facebook page, I know I know those exist, you know, a county Facebook page and you can just get your face everywhere. Just by that. I'm pausing you know because you just said another amazing thing. So because I live in a little neighborhood called Wicker Park, we have a Wicker Park community group and and we're all you know what, you know what most of the posts are either there's a lost cat or dog at somebody wants to find other than that. It's does anyone have a good recommendation for an Indian restaurant or whatever a hairdresser or doctor or whatever. So you pretty just said this amazing thing. You you go interview the the business that you want to support. Whatever it is doesn't matter what it is. Just something that you are really into. And then you absolutely have a community page somewhere online on Facebook or there's other places too. But and then post it there and then oh, by the way, they've learned that Courtney the REALTOR is putting this out. That's amazing. Yeah. You're their market expert. That's it. That's how you want to brand yourself with your face in on social media. Oh, I love that. With social media that I I like to drill like drill in on is going live. So people are uncomfortable. They don't like going live in front of the camera. It's not for you. It's for other people. So when you go live and you're at a showing or you're at an open house or you're at you know we have a a theater downtown where I live going live there and saying I'm live here with this Beatles tribute band. And just those things won't go into your won't go into your feed. They won't go onto your profile but they're going to go in your stories. And it looks like you're everywhere all the time. And this has nothing to do with anything I just said. But when you're posting in your stories, people don't need to know that you're actually you know on your couch ordering a pizza, you know watching a movie. It looks like out and about. It looks like you're constantly going. Yes. And perceptions important. It is. It is. So if you look like you're everywhere and you're involved in everything and you dabble in everything, people will say, oh Courtney's done this. She's been here. And then they'll come to me. And it just builds that relationship. And you're also providing value because like by the way Beatles are my favorite band of all time. So I will always go see a Beatles tribute band. But but the but what you says is really important because whether you're actually at the event or you're just promoting the event saying, Hey, Beatles fans, there's this there's a Beatles thing tonight. Like that's that's still incredible value to people. They're like, wow, Courtney really knows what's going on. Whether you're there dancing or or not even able to attend this idea of providing value even outside of real estate, just saying like, I know what's going on because this is my community. I work in this community. Oh, brilliant. We're talking about branding now really. We're talking about this idea. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, my gosh. Nobody needs to know you're on your couch near pajamas. Like you're providing value. That's literally what our job is to do is to provide value. Be a market resource. Be people. Be there. Go to person. And that will eventually you don't get water the same day. You take the while it will turn into clients. It will turn into referrals. I've seen this time and time again in my own business. And we've only been in business, you know, a few years. Unbelieve. What percentage of your business comes from social media? No, I mean, just a general idea of, I want to pause for a moment to talk about our episode sponsor are one of my favorite companies out there. Follow up boss. Now, after interviewing hundreds of top REALTORS in the country for this podcast, do you know which CRM is used by more than any other by our guests? Of course, it is follow up boss.

That's follow up boss dot com forward slash real for your free 30 day trial. Follow up like a boss with follow up boss. And now back to our episode. My personal business is all social media. Everything that I do, I we do get leads on the team, but I don't take I don't take leads. I pass those out. Sure. So all of my last year, I just social media referrals. I had 30 I close 30 transactions. Amazing. That's amazing. So this idea, how long did it see you talked about? Yeah, look, you know, we're this is a marathon, not a sprint. You post once and then nothing happens. And you're like, well, that didn't work. And it's like, no, it probably did work. It's just not how people make decisions about about their biggest one of their biggest assets. If not their biggest asset, they need to get comfortable. It's going to take time at the followers, the followership is going to grow. How long did it take before you started seeing results on social? It was probably maybe a year and a half or two years into consistently posting that I really started to get. And you'll see in the packet in the PDF that I am going to share with everybody, you'll see examples of people saying, hey, do you have a business card or phone number? I can share with my ex husband, he's on the hunt for a house. Courtney Hathfield, 100%. She's amazing and local to the Canton area, one of the nicest ladies, you'll ever meet. And I share a ton of screenshots. Just proof that this does work. If you keep putting in the time, putting, you know, it takes time. It does take time. I'm very authentic in what I post. I'm not, it's not everything is curated. It's right now you'll look at my Instagram and I just bought a house and I'm redoing it and just little projects. And so you'll see a bunch of reels of me, you know, attempting different projects. It's what's really happening in my life. And I get comments on there that people are like, I can't wait to see how this turns out. And, you know, it keeps people in the loop. So they may not need me for real estate right now. But if they want to redo their fireplace, they can call me, you know, yeah, still providing that value, even those very authentic to who I am. And, and, and they might, they might be doing their fireplace and going, you know, we don't know the right masonry guy or the architected or the contractor, like, we should ask Courtney because I know I've been following her and this is what she's up to. I love that. I love that. That is really, really smart. And I don't know that anyone's ever really talked about that in that way on the show. So I appreciate you going into that detail. And I'm a marketer. So I just absolutely love this conversation. And it's so funny because what we're not talking about necessarily is how to hone your actual skills as a REALTOR, which you absolutely should be doing on top of that. But I think agents focus on that quite a lot, which they should. And they often neglect this, this marathon, like you were saying, one and a half to two years before you saw results on social. That is not a fun ride, right? Like that is a, that is a, it's a grind that you just have to trust is eventually going to pay off. And it's just like this podcast. Nobody listened to this podcast for the first year and I have nobody cared about it. And took you took that long before anyone even noticed it. So I am right with you. Right. You have, you have to put it in the time. I'm weary about instant success. So every day that I'm like, are we still like a top producing team? You know what I mean? I still question how, how I just question it because I feel like instant success, there's something to be said about it. But we really have, you have to put in the work and we really have to get where we are. Social media, I do recommend. So what I, my method on social media is I pick five topics to post about. And they are real estate related. And I can fly through those real quick just to make it. So the first thing I post are pictures of myself because like I said, photos of faces get more, they get more engagement than photos of like, I don't know, a sunset. Then I post work, new listing, sold listings, reviews, market news, and team news. And anytime I post team news, I am a big fan of giving credit where it's due. So I am tagging the entire team. It's not about me. It's about them. This is their businesses that we are trying to grow. And so I will tag every single person. So now what I just posted about your home court team ends up on six different Facebook pages or Instagram pages or Instagram stories. And our brand grows from there. I'm a big big advocate of posting reviews. You should absolutely don't post a one star review. But if you've got a five star review, then you should absolutely post it. If you sold a million dollar house, it doesn't matter if you sold that house last July, you still sold that million dollar house. So post it. At keep posting it post, you know, different like different photos of it because you are a million dollar agent now. You sold that. And you could even every year on the home anniversary say congratulations to so-and-so who purchased or sold this home a year ago. So much fun working with you. You know, could be something like that. And tag them. Absolutely. Absolutely. Yes. The third thing I post, I post my kids. And I always try to make it business related. So my daughter had career day at school. She's six. She wanted to dress up like me for career day. So she put on her earrings. She put on her sweatshirt. That says, your home court team. She carried her purse. And she carried a little coffee mug. And that's what she went to school. And I posted the picture. And everybody loved it. Where I'll put the cutest thing I've ever heard. It was it was like, well, she had my business cards in her little, she had a little fake Louis Vuitton purse. And she put her business cards in there. And she took them. And I was like, pass those babies out like get them everywhere. So I also put the pictures of that or her in front of a listing sign. You know, pretending like she sold it. Just. Oh, that's great. I love that. Different ideas to kind of bring it. It's still business related, but it's still personal to me. Sure. I'll post quotes. I do like sales quotes. And funny, the quotes that I see get the most interaction or saves on Instagram are quotes about money. And I. Interesting. Yeah. I've never I've never even spoken about this with anybody because that's just like one of those. You look at your insights and you're like, oh, okay. But I've noticed quotes about money, financial freedom, things like that. Those get the most saves and shares on Instagram, which I thought was. So I've ramped up sharing those. Well, everybody wants more money, right? So I think that's makes sense. Yeah. Absolutely. It yeah, it does. And then I post I. I like doing DIYs. So I that is my fifth thing that I post our DIY videos of the house or I'm a big thrifter or something that I found a good will or all post things like that. Very authentic to me brings in a different type of audience. Sure. But it's the engagement and they know that I'm a real sure on the meantime. Well, and I want to point out something about the DIY crowd because DIY crowd is online. This is where they're learning oftentimes how to do some of their DIY projects. So this this is also like going where your audience is. Yes, it may be it's a different audience than than who was more attracted to other posts of yours. But that's the whole point is you have different different sort of categories for different types of clients. And this idea of DIY people are always looking for inspiration ideas and instruction. So that is I've never heard anyone talk about that. That's really smart. It's it's home. It's you know, we sell homes for a living. So people, what do they want to do? They want to renovate their home or they want to update it in some way. And so I just post my personal DIY projects and products that I got things like that. And I mean, like I said, it's a different following, but it's it's very in line with what I do. I love them. You have given us so many great. I'm sorry. Did we hit all five of your topics because I will okay good because I am I just know you were you were wonderful I lose track of things because I get so excited with with a lot of these ideas and I'm realizing as a was so funny. So this is this is Courtney. It was kind enough not to scold me, but she she probably should have because she said to me before we started do you guys have Instagram and I'm like not really for the podcast. And I was like how stupid are we that we don't have Instagram yet. And I've had about lots of people talk about social media in the past. So this is my challenge to myself to take my own advice or Courtney's advice rather. And I'm going to commit to starting to post more regularly about the podcast as well as our own business for recruiting REALTORS. But you are absolutely right. And you're getting all of your business through social that is in the same. Yes, that one thing. And I know we talked about something mistakes agents make on social media. Yeah. Politics. COVID, you know, religion issues that yeah, religion, things that we are we're not in the market to debate. We're in the market to sell houses. So let's if somebody you know if I vote for somebody and somebody else votes for somebody, I'm not going to not sell them house. They didn't vote for the person I wanted. You know, I don't care who they voted for. I care that they, you know, used me to buy their house. So I just keep all of that separate. You'll never find a single thing on my page about anything political. Well, it's just going to polarize. It'll polarize an alienate a certain group. And you're as a business owner, I guess there's I guess a strategy of like if I polarize one side, maybe the other side comes. I don't know. It seems like a very risky strategy. I would rather let everybody want to work with it. Yeah. 100% and I am shocked by how many agents I see that are just so like rude about it on Facebook or Instagram. More so Facebook. But I'm just like, oh my gosh, just don't stop talking. Yeah, I'm a big fan of the the REALTOR community lab code agents, which is I think the largest REALTOR community online. And it's wonderful. And there's so much value there. And I love Tristan and those guys. They're lovely. They've been on my show. But you're right. Like and this is just a REALTOR thing that other people wouldn't necessarily see. But there's a lot of like, you know, a brokerage has, you know, layoffs or something bad happens to a brokerage. And there is a lot of brokers out there who are like, thank God, so and so is going down and I'm just, it's just it's an incredible amount. And I go, I wonder what they're posting on their own public stuff. If you know, they're willing to sort, it's very strange. So don't really make people. Exactly. There's enough sun to shine for every single person. And you know what? I kind of feel like if you were not, if you used your time better, maybe, like, maybe you should be selling a house instead of complaining on Facebook, you know, right. Yeah, you're right. And people who, you know, just being really conscious about the about your image and that's not a bad thing. It's called branding. It's really important. It's funny. I like we're starting I'm starting another podcast unreal estate related for non real estate related for for an organization. And as a result, I'm just interviewing people for this particular nonprofit. Yeah. And it has nothing to do with me, but someone has to be the podcast host. And so I had to really think that even though I don't speak for the organization, I'm not on their board of directors. I'm I'm I'm part of the community of this organization, but I'm not their main person. But it's going to come across that I'm the main person because I'm going to be doing this podcast. And I had to realize, okay, it's important for me not to insert myself into this new podcast because I don't I don't speak for this brand, but you speak for your own brand. And on this show, I can be as you know, obnoxious as I want because it's my own brand. But but you're absolutely right is is really being aware that, you know, every time you post it's permanent, it's forever. And you know, maybe people should be more conscious of what their brand is because their clients are going to look them up. They they really are. Yeah, just be very careful what you put on and what you're willing. Some people that's a hill they're willing to die on. So all right, I'll take the clients you don't want. I love that. And and also I said this at the beginning, but I sort of said it quickly. Courtney is being generous enough to provide a a guide for our audience to really help them understand best practices around social media marketing. We're going to make that available. It's in the show notes. It's a PDF super easy to get and really will help you start your journey there. What do you tell agents of people that that you speak to about doing more on social if they're afraid to sort of turn the camera on themselves? If there is a fear of, I don't really, you know, it's hard for me to expose. Maybe, you know, there's just a lot of people aren't comfortable in front of a camera. I know I'm not. They are. I'm not either, but a lot of people are and some agents on my team aren't comfortable with it. And a lot of the time, it really just takes practice. It just takes practice. Honestly, there are nobody's thinking about what you look like when you send them that video. They're listening to what you have to say. And people look too far into it. They really do. So, you know, I, it just takes practice. Stand in front of a mirror, record yourself a few times. One thing that I have told my team is instead, so let's say they make connection with a new lead. Send that person a video and say it was so nice to talk to you. I can't do it. Make a video of your face. And send it to them. It's so much better than, hey, this is Courtney Hatfield, you know, it was such a pleasure. And being, you know, sending them a text message. That's so much more generic. Anybody can send a text message. What makes this different? Let's send a video message. So, so I want to, I want to drill down on this for a moment because I want to make sure I understand the process because this is brilliant. So, let's say you're at an open house, you get a list of people that have come in and now at the end of the open house, you now have names and phone numbers and email addresses of people to follow up with who maybe they're not going to buy the home, but maybe they're, you know, you could show them other properties. So, are, so you're saying make a video for those people as well? Yes. And how, how do you send that? I'm sorry. How do you distribute that to them? Just through a text platform. We use follow up boss. So I send my stuff through follow up boss. But you follow a boss. There are, there are, there are sponsor of ours. So we love follow up boss. Yeah. Shame on there you go. I, yeah. But you're right. You're right. We all have phones that can easily do this turn around. Hey, it was so good meeting you with the open house. I love it. That's, that's all it is. And I just flip my camera around. I take a video. It was so nice to meet you guys at the open house. I know this home wasn't for you, but I'm going to go into home and send you some options that might be looking forward to working with you. Then they see your face again, they're more apt to respond like we said, faces, get more interaction, then just a generic text message that anybody can type of a text message. Sure, anybody can send a video, but not everybody will. In fact, almost nobody will. Exactly. And it's just really, it's just really, it makes you stand out against your competition. It does. And it shows that you are willing to go a little bit further, maybe than other REALTORS to sort of earn the business. I guess not even win the business earn it. I think you do have to earn it. And I think earning it is through showing people that you're willing to work, work for them and making a video shows, I mean, again, it's, it's just a great, great idea. Now, I'm going to, we're going to put a cap on this episode because Courtney's given so much of herself in this episode that I think our audience is like madly scribbling notes about what they can do because this is incredible. And Courtney has got to go because they're probably closing a home later today. So I'm going to, I'm going to, I'm going to do this. And I want to have you back in the future to even give more, more and more tips, but you've given us a solid hour of unbelievable tips and advice for social media. I am so, so grateful to have had you on our show. And I want to make, make a point that if there are any REALTORS out there who are maybe in the, the Cleveland or surrounding areas, Akron areas, well, you know, and you're looking to maybe join a team, you know, you never know reach out to Courtney and see if she might be a good fit, or you might be a good fit for her team. And by the way, maybe you're just somebody who's looking for a REALTOR to either your REALTOR in another area and you have somebody moving to that area, or that, you know, you're not a REALTOR and you found our podcast and you want to work with somebody like Courtney. And by the way, if you live in those areas, you absolutely should, you know, what's the best way that someone should reach out to you? You can find me on Facebook, Courtney Hatfield, or you can find me on Instagram, Courtney Hatfield.REALTOR, all one word. I'm on all the social media. You can find me anywhere. Courtney Hatfield. And and all of those links will be in the show notes if you're listening to this through a podcast app. And also remember to download her PDF of some best social media practices that she was so kind to to provide to our audience. And Courtney, on behalf of our audience, we really drank from the fire hose today. And so I am, my head is spinning a bit and I am about to start to put some some things into action for our own podcast here and my own real estate business or the world's business I work for so that I can get better results on social. So I want to check back in with you shortly and and I get you back on the show. So on behalf of the audience, you provided incredible values. So thank you. And I know how busy you are. So thank you on top of that. And also, we appreciate it so much. And also on behalf of Courtney and myself, we want to thank everyone who's watching and listening to the end. We really appreciate your participation in our show and the best way you can help us grow is by telling a friend. Just think of one other REALTOR that could benefit from hearing maybe somebody who needs to have a better social media presence and send them a link to this episode. The best way you can have introduced someone to us, just send to our website, keeping it real pod.com or just have them pull up a podcast app search for keeping it real. Hit the subscribe button.

And we will see everybody on the next episode. Thank you.
