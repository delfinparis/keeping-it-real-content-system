[00:04:20] Q-C REALTOR Q-C REALTOR. Yeah Quad City. So guys, don't worry. It'll link to it in the show notes
[00:04:26] Sarah DeWolf Q-C REALTOR on Instagram and we'll also have a link to our website which is Sarah DeWolf Realtor.com
[00:04:34] Sarah, I'm so excited to have you tell us you got into the market in 2010
[00:04:39] Not the easiest time to get into the market. So I want to hear about what that experience was like because we have a lot of agents today getting in right now
[00:04:47] And it's not quite as awful as it was back then, but it is still a challenging time
[00:04:52] So tell us about how how you got started and why? Sure
[00:04:55] So at the time in 2010 I was in college and my major was psychology
[00:05:01] My dad was a REALTOR so I am a second-generation REALTOR
[00:05:04] He was a managing broker for our offices and said you should get into real estate
[00:05:09] And so it wasn't something that I grew up thinking that I was going to do and I he did it for 20 years
[00:05:14] And so I watched him and it I always was interested in real estate
[00:05:18] But I didn't know that that was the path I was going to go down
[00:05:21] However, I was I didn't want to do school anymore. I didn't want to get my masters or PhD and psychology does come in handy every day with real estate
[00:05:29] So it does it worked out so he
[00:05:33] Him and I worked together. We would do all of our listings together and buyers separately
[00:05:38] So it was kind of a we weren't really a team, but sort of we were the father-daughter team on listings
[00:05:43] And so it was nice because he he taught me everything I know
[00:05:47] And we would drive around all day to different appointments and I would listen to him and listen to
[00:05:52] 45 different agents calling him with headaches and so I felt like I was on a fast track to learning this business
[00:05:59] Which every day is different and now 13 years in I'm still learning things of course and each deal has different
[00:06:06] Different things that you've got to kind of work through
[00:06:09] So he passed away in 2019
[00:06:13] And it was pretty unexpected
[00:06:15] He was he was in a surgery and my I looked at my husband and we didn't know if he was going to make it out of that surgery
[00:06:21] And I looked at my husband and said what am I going to do because it had always just been him and I
[00:06:27] He didn't die that night thankfully, but I had two more weeks with him and he did unfortunately pass away
[00:06:33] So I had to quickly pick up the pieces and I knew for sure that he wouldn't want me sitting around crying
[00:06:40] So I just went right to work and figured out how am I going to really do this without him
[00:06:46] So that was in 2019 and that year I had sold 12 million in sales and 2020 I sold 20
[00:06:55] 23 million
[00:06:56] So I almost doubled my sales. Thank you
[00:07:00] And grew it ever since then so I hope he's looking down and proud
[00:07:03] But he is certainly missed but how lucky am I that I had such a great teacher for 10 years
[00:07:09] Yeah, it's life is a mixture of um tragedy and fortunate
[00:07:15] fortunate events and it's just this dance of peaks and valleys and we all go through it um and
[00:07:22] Yeah, my my heart goes out to you for losing your your father
[00:07:26] We we're all we're all going to do it someday. We're all going to lose
[00:07:30] lose our parents and and it is oh it's a scariest thing ever
[00:07:33] But um I also you also
[00:07:37] Had some health issue yourself that came at a very young age and I'm
[00:07:43] If you don't mind sharing that I'm curious because I'm what I'm curious about is
[00:07:48] What how that experience maybe shaped you into who you are today
[00:07:53] Because it was a pretty serious one if you don't mind
[00:07:55] Yeah, absolutely
[00:07:56] So that I I had melanoma I had a mole on my arm that didn't look great
[00:08:02] But at the time I was 26 and that uh it's probably nothing and so I ended up going in probably way later than I should have
[00:08:10] And they they took the mole off and said oh best case scenario we caught it early stage 1 a
[00:08:15] Um you will remove it and then they said but because of your age we're gonna test a couple couple lymph nodes just to make sure
[00:08:21] Well, they did that and it two of the lymph nodes tested positive
[00:08:25] So for whatever reason the type of cancer that I had they could see actively splitting under a microscope
[00:08:31] So it was moving very very quickly
[00:08:33] So I quickly went from stage 1 a to stage 3b, which is much more serious
[00:08:38] So I had to do a lot of scans and luckily it hadn't spread past my lymph nodes
[00:08:43] We caught it kind of just in time
[00:08:44] So I had several surgeries and that was a that was a rough time
[00:08:48] It was I was probably three years into the business and so it was starting to get more consistent
[00:08:54] But not quite and so
[00:08:56] Between just being scared to death literally um am I gonna survive this and I was dating my husband at the time
[00:09:03] But we weren't married um and so that was about a year long of going back and forth to Iowa City to the hospital there and
[00:09:10] Just making sure that
[00:09:12] Everything was okay and thank god no issues sense and that was it'll be 10 years in February
[00:09:17] Well, but it changed my life. I can I can tell you that for sure
[00:09:21] Yeah, what what did she obviously you know
[00:09:25] Significant events like that do tend to change people's perspective or they're maybe even change their goals or
[00:09:32] They're you know the things that are they're important the things that are important to them their their values
[00:09:38] How did how did that change your you? I've always been a don't sweat the small stuff type of person
[00:09:44] But even more so now it's little things that aren't going to matter in five years or an agent just makes you so mad
[00:09:51] You want to call and yell at them or say this isn't right
[00:09:53] But is it worth it? Is it gonna change anything? No
[00:09:57] So it's just a matter of taking a day at a time and being so grateful for my health
[00:10:02] That at at 26 it hits you different when you start to think am I gonna make it
[00:10:08] And you really don't think about that and your 20 is very often and really without our health
[00:10:13] We have nothing so all these little things stressors in life if you're happy if your family's healthy. That's all that matters
[00:10:21] Yeah, I was having a moment last night where I was starting to judge myself
[00:10:27] Unfairly I was thinking about something in my life that I don't have or as much of as I want and I was cooking
[00:10:32] And I really enjoy cooking and I was uh making this meal that I'd never made before it was kind of a fun thing
[00:10:38] But I was sitting there going gosh, I don't have this and that and you know like I'm so I you know
[00:10:42] Such a loser whatever, you know the things that negative self-thought and I realized I said well
[00:10:47] But I have this moment where I'm cooking and why am I like I could enjoy this moment while I'm cooking
[00:10:52] I can get back to beating myself up later
[00:10:55] But I said I said boy I'm missing out on this fun thing I like to do just because I'm I'm you know caught up in this in this judgment
[00:11:03] So it is really important I think to monitor and pay attention be mindful of of what's going on inside of a specially around as you mentioned
[00:11:11] Like anger, you know, I I think a great rule of thumb in this industry and anger is going to come up because people just do goofy things and other
[00:11:19] REALTORS may do things that you don't like and your clients may do things that you don't like but I always say um
[00:11:24] I I don't make good decisions when I'm angry and I certainly don't have access to all my faculties
[00:11:30] And I can't make oftentimes the best logical decision
[00:11:33] So I think what you said was really great. It's like when you're angry
[00:11:37] Now that's not right really the time to communicate right settle down first
[00:11:41] REALTORS it's like Sarah says it may just be a small thing even though it feels big in the moment
[00:11:46] Give yourself a breath and then then respond let it go yes, let it let it or just let it go
[00:11:51] Let it go
[00:11:54] Yes, unless it's something where you can't let it go and you need to actually take action
[00:11:58] But most of the time most things resolve themselves, but Sarah
[00:12:01] Well, I want to learn more about you because you have to get licensed in two states
[00:12:06] Not the easiest thing or most fun thing to do but based on the geography of where you practice it is critical
[00:12:13] And so you have to sort of know how to do deals on two different probably emaleses
[00:12:18] I don't know if it's the same oh it's the same emalesce luckily it's the same emalesce
[00:12:22] Oh, thank goodness. That makes it look easier
[00:12:24] But you know, I want to talk you you did 117 sales last year that is insane
[00:12:30] In the best possible compliment I could give somebody
[00:12:33] You you knocked out almost 40 million in production and this is what you did yourself, which is crazy
[00:12:41] Let's talk about how you did that. Yes, you had a father great mentor wonderful
[00:12:47] REALTOR
[00:12:48] And you learned and developed your skills, but
[00:12:51] most people who even come from a family that that was in real estate they don't do a hundred and seventeen sales in a year
[00:12:59] So what's your secret not that there's a secret what's your what I hate to say that word what's the what's your strategy?
[00:13:05] Well works. Yeah, it's been so I
[00:13:09] I had systems in place when I first started that I've tried to tweak over the years
[00:13:14] As Sharon Sarvatsis says just because it's tried and true doesn't mean that it's working right now
[00:13:18] So I've advertised I used to advertise on Zillow that 10 years ago that was huge for me
[00:13:24] And I had a ton of customers come clients come in that way
[00:13:28] Now I would never advertise on Zillow
[00:13:30] So it's little things along that I've just tried to tweak and get better
[00:13:35] I should note that I also had a baby last year and with that being said
[00:13:38] I have an incredibly supportive husband and family and mom and to which none of this would be possible without all of them
[00:13:45] So it's not just me
[00:13:47] But I I really to think two big things that my dad instilled in me is to create
[00:13:52] Raving fans and that customer service is a lost art and I always remember when I go to a hotel and they go above and beyond
[00:14:02] Maybe it's my birthday and there's a bottle of champagne in the room and it's it's little things like that
[00:14:07] If you do more than what the customer expects
[00:14:10] Any a lot of I shouldn't say anyone, but most people could be a REALTOR
[00:14:14] It's a lot harder than I think what people think and it's hard to grow your business and I also don't think that people
[00:14:22] Sit down and say okay, this is my business. I'm not just selling real estate. I'm I'm creating a business and I'm in charge of that
[00:14:29] Working on the business as opposed to in the business in the businesses all the stuff I need to do now my clients
[00:14:36] My prospecting all of the activities and then on the businesses. Okay, let's take a step back and look at this as a business owner
[00:14:43] Where they're inefficiencies where can I delegate how can I make this whole process run all these processes run smoother?
[00:14:50] Yes, yes, and I guess it's it's been interesting from 2010 to now seeing the difference in the market and in the quatsities
[00:14:58] We're lucky because we don't see these big huge drops in prices
[00:15:04] We've been consistent as far as equity goes and so that helps, but it's also not a big
[00:15:10] It's not a huge town like Chicago, but with Iowa and Illinois. We've got quite a few people
[00:15:16] So it I guess it's just it's important to look at your business and see what's working and what's not working and always be tweaking those systems
[00:15:25] I think that oh go ahead. No
[00:15:27] I said um
[00:15:30] when
[00:15:31] I started and you're you don't have a lot of clients and I was 23 and so a lot of my friends weren't quite buying houses yet
[00:15:37] And there's things that I know that I did write and there's I guess advice that I have that I should have done
[00:15:44] I should have been working on Google reviews from day one. I can't imagine how many I would have
[00:15:48] Let's pause for a second
[00:15:50] So I want to I want to step in with this because um we have about 800 just under 800 agents that are firm
[00:15:55] And we didn't do much with Google reviews up until about maybe three years ago
[00:16:00] And now what we do is we send um a a a a the opportunity to do a Google review to every one of our broker or every one of our agents clients
[00:16:09] So that we you know we we uh we just say hey let us know what you thought of your REALTOR and and we went from having almost
[00:16:16] Almost no reviews to now we have I think six or seven hundred
[00:16:21] It's never too late to start everyone. This can work
[00:16:24] Go ahead. This this is a good story. So I
[00:16:27] Had a my previous brokerage they use testimonial tree and when I switched I lost all of those
[00:16:33] So I went to my google page and I think I had 11 reviews which is absolutely ridiculous for doing this for 13 years
[00:16:40] So I knew I needed to do something and quick
[00:16:42] So I have always been in a believer in mailings and not the traditional postcard that people are just going to throw in the trash
[00:16:49] I try to stick to maybe three or four quarterly something that they're going to keep on their refrigerator
[00:16:55] So in Iowa we don't have a professional football team
[00:16:57] So the hot guys are everybody cheers for the hot guys or they should
[00:17:00] So I sent out the football magnet and then I'm top of mind on their refrigerator all season long
[00:17:06] I've sent out grocery magnets all kinds of just different things
[00:17:09] But one thing that I did recently is I I needed Google reviews
[00:17:14] So I sent out some things saying I'm celebrating 13 years in business
[00:17:18] Thank you for all your support. I'm going to be giving away
[00:17:21] I think I did a solo stove of pizza oven a black stone kind of some cool things that I spent
[00:17:27] $1,500
[00:17:29] But I also did gifts
[00:17:30] Yeah, I sent it to my mailing list which is about 500 people
[00:17:34] um, it's past clients, but it's also just my sphere of influence and I got 72 Google reviews
[00:17:41] So that yes, and so in my clients were so excited they they
[00:17:46] Wrote the review which probably didn't take a more than a minute and when we drew their name
[00:17:50] We sent anyone that filled one out. We sent even if it's a $10 gift card ice cream or something
[00:17:55] They got something
[00:17:57] But it was a good way to quickly grow those Google reviews because reviews are so important
[00:18:02] And everyone's going to Google you even if they're your closest friends
[00:18:06] They're still going to Google you just because they want to see how you do or what other
[00:18:10] What other clients think about you and Google is obviously top of the mountain for
[00:18:15] For reviews. I would say Zellos probably number two for where people find reviews
[00:18:20] So yes, it's a great idea
[00:18:22] And it also helps with SEO local SEO in particular meaning
[00:18:27] showing up on
[00:18:28] web searches when people are searching for real tours in their area
[00:18:32] Google you know can make a general assumption that if somebody's got hundreds and hundreds of five star reviews
[00:18:38] Odds are there probably a pretty decent
[00:18:41] Search result to serve up to to a consumer who's looking so yes google my business is the name of the platform
[00:18:48] Or I think they change the amount of things just google business
[00:18:50] But anyway get yourself on google
[00:18:53] Why would you talk about referrals because well?
[00:18:56] I'm going to talk about something that leads to referrals you said going above and beyond
[00:19:01] Can you give us a couple of examples of ways in which you do that that maybe you think not every agent does?
[00:19:08] Sure, so
[00:19:10] Most people don't buy in sell houses every day
[00:19:13] So a lot of times especially with first-time home buyers
[00:19:15] They're intimidated and really don't know what to do
[00:19:18] So I it's amazing to me how many agents don't do buyers consultations and that is a
[00:19:24] Must for me so when someone calls and they're ready to buy a house whether it's their first house or their tenth house
[00:19:29] We sit down to talk about their goals. I give expectations on the market
[00:19:33] What's what to expect and if you do an inspection and you want to ask for something please know that amends the contract
[00:19:39] So we don't want to ask for something small
[00:19:42] Because a lot of times buyers want to renegotiate or whatever it ends up being
[00:19:46] So I do different checkpoints through the process with them
[00:19:50] We start with our buyers consultation
[00:19:52] Assuming they're already pre-approved. We'll start shopping for houses as we're shopping
[00:19:56] I'm pointing out things. I'm certainly not an inspector
[00:19:59] But I see a lot of inspection so I can say hey, this might come up just be prepared
[00:20:03] Then we'll I have a full-time assistant shout out carry. I could not do this without her. She is amazing
[00:20:10] And so she does different checkpoints like when we get closer to closing
[00:20:14] It's hey Sarah wanted me to remind you to switch utilities and it's links to all the utilities
[00:20:19] Even internet cable all those things or and then two weeks after closing
[00:20:24] We send out an email saying hey just a reminder make sure you sign up for that homestead tax credit
[00:20:30] So I try to just make the process as simple as possible for them, but also
[00:20:36] Not to I don't I've never looked at my business as transactional
[00:20:41] I've always just said yes to everything and I think that that is
[00:20:45] In part of big I guess it's a big part of my success
[00:20:47] I see a lot of new agents that get so caught up in price point and
[00:20:52] I don't want to go show that 60,000 house
[00:20:55] Well, the person that's buying the 60,000 house has family and friends and if you can create a
[00:21:00] Raving fan like my dad said they're gonna tell all their friends and family what a great experience they had with you
[00:21:06] So that's been really important to me is how do I make sure that my buyers and sell
[00:21:11] Have the best experience and that I'm giving them best-case scenario worst-case scenario and enough information for them to make an informed decision
[00:21:21] So right now the market is thank you for all of that by the way
[00:21:25] That was all just exactly the way I feel about what REALTORS ought to do for customer service and going above above and beyond is
[00:21:34] It's it's it's it's what it's I think M Scott peck wrote
[00:21:37] It's never crowded along the extra mile or someone wrote that book
[00:21:40] But it's he's right. It's literally not that crowded on the extra mile
[00:21:45] And it doesn't mean you have to you know
[00:21:47] Sprints a mile for somebody it does not mean that it just means going a little bit beyond what they would expect
[00:21:54] You know, it's as simple as just knowing what's going on in your clients lives and reaching out to them from time to time to check in on them
[00:22:00] And ask about their kids or you know whatever they're dealing with as a family or business
[00:22:06] But it is the market has shifted so it we have interest rates in the eights at this point
[00:22:13] So if you're lucky in the high sevens and you know, there's the vast majority of homeowners in this country
[00:22:19] Have a under a four percent mortgage at this point in fact like I think it's like 90 percent have under a four percent mortgage
[00:22:26] So there's not a big incentive for people to move unless they have to so I'm curious about what you're doing to stay positive
[00:22:34] Stay productive um and just you know keep your business chugging along uh right now
[00:22:41] Yeah
[00:22:41] Social media I think is our biggest tool as agents and I'll get into a little bit on well
[00:22:48] With social media, I think that it is the most important thing that we can be posting to and people get so caught up in rates
[00:22:55] And obviously it's very impactful into our market
[00:22:58] But usually what I tell people when they get nervous about it is if you're comfortable with the payment
[00:23:03] The interest rates shouldn't matter too much and people sign up for 27 percent credit cards every day
[00:23:08] So if you love the house that is a great point
[00:23:12] So if you love the house and you can afford it buy it
[00:23:15] Always replace it by the way don't sign up for 27 percent credit cards everybody
[00:23:20] Especially while you're buying a house
[00:23:22] Yes, yes, and if you are somebody that doesn't pay their entire balance off every month uh then yes do not say
[00:23:29] But yeah, it's so absolutely right you're right the rate is it that important but what the rate can do is still drive people away
[00:23:36] Right so you know that the rate isn't that as an as relevant but the consumer might feel like oh I missed the bow to a couple years ago
[00:23:43] I could have gotten in for 2.9
[00:23:46] So what is your does that happen do you do come across people like that?
[00:23:50] Oh, yeah constantly um and it a lot of people sometimes it doesn't make sense for them to move right now if
[00:23:56] If it's going to be a lateral move to a small even a smaller house based on a 2.9 percent interest rate then we just pause it
[00:24:05] It I guess for me it's
[00:24:08] The way that I've kept things moving is I try to remind people to not get their local
[00:24:14] Real estate advice from the news
[00:24:17] The news is going to talk about its doomsday and
[00:24:21] Houses aren't selling and that isn't true at all
[00:24:24] We still very much are in an inventory issue at least in Iowa and Illinois in the Quad Cities
[00:24:29] So things are selling really quickly
[00:24:30] So one thing that I've done well for 13 years is every Tuesday I send out
[00:24:35] expired letters
[00:24:36] So I go through the last seven days of expired listings and we know those people want to sell their house
[00:24:42] Or they wouldn't have put it for sale and sometimes
[00:24:45] Circumstances change
[00:24:46] But I would say that I I get I don't know two to four listings a year from that and a lot of times
[00:24:51] It's just they picked they just called any agent and maybe didn't have a good experience or maybe their house
[00:24:58] Just wasn't marketed properly
[00:25:00] But to me in this market at least here everything is selling so an expired listing is a really good way to get a new listing
[00:25:08] So I started that 13 years ago and it still works
[00:25:12] That's amazing so so I'm going to I'm going to break this down for anyone who's not familiar with what expires are
[00:25:17] So these are obviously listings that have expired and there are services that you can subscribe to for
[00:25:22] Really very inexpensive pricing
[00:25:25] That will get that will serve you up daily here are the expires or you can obviously look on your your MLS system and set up searches for that
[00:25:32] But it's a lot of companies will provide these you know these daily leads to you
[00:25:37] The problem is they sell those leads to lots of different agents
[00:25:40] And so what Sarah is doing that's very unique is typically when people hear maybe you should call expires is that calling process
[00:25:48] I'm going to call the the homeowner and that can work
[00:25:51] It certainly can work the challenges that homeowners probably getting a lot of phone calls
[00:25:56] Especially when those leads become available because when it expires all these lead companies push it out to all of the people that are purchasing them
[00:26:04] And so the person might get type phone calls in a day
[00:26:06] If you might be number eight and they're going to be like oh stop calling it has nothing to do with you
[00:26:11] So it's Sarah does which is really a lot softer is she sends a mailer out?
[00:26:15] Do you like a letter or postcard? What it's just a it's just a letter and it's add it's addressed right to them in handwriting
[00:26:22] But the letter itself is tight. Yes
[00:26:24] And so it's it's very simple to maybe three paragraphs of
[00:26:29] Just a note non obligation we can get together kind of talk about different strategies
[00:26:34] And it works and I'd be happy to share it with anyone that's listening
[00:26:37] So feel free to email or shoot me. I miss please please do that is so generous
[00:26:42] We'll provide Sarah's contact information in the show notes so you can reach out to her to get her expired a letter
[00:26:48] Although if you're in her market area, let's not do that. But anywhere else yet. No, I I'm only teasing
[00:26:54] There are no secrets in real estate
[00:26:56] But we are so grateful that you share that and so this is really smart and and I want to
[00:27:03] Break this down just a little bit further. So every Tuesday or once a week
[00:27:07] Sarah sends yeah every Tuesday
[00:27:09] Sarah sees all the expires that have come in in the past week and she sends this letter out hand writes the envelope because what what do we know
[00:27:15] Handwritten envelopes get opened regular envelopes get thrown away
[00:27:20] So hand write your envelopes inside just just you know a standard letter and
[00:27:26] And Sarah said she gets anywhere from two to four listings a year now that might not sound like a lot for sending on all those
[00:27:32] Mailers
[00:27:33] By the way a lot of these lead companies that send you expires can also send out mailers for you
[00:27:38] Although I don't know if they can do the handwriting. So Sarah does that manually, which is probably the better way to do it
[00:27:43] But you could technically automate it if you really wanted to
[00:27:47] But the idea is that this is still a cash flow positive marketing expense because
[00:27:53] You know if she's sending out mailers. I'm assuming it still nets you you know two to four deals a year
[00:27:59] It's got to pay for all of the mailers. I'm guessing easily. Yes easily. So it's kind of a no-brainer like there's no reason to not do it
[00:28:07] And it doesn't require that much work your assistant. I'm assuming does the majority of the heavy lifting there
[00:28:12] Yes, boy, that is such a brilliant strategy guys. She just gave you a basically
[00:28:18] And I something that should pay for itself now every market's different and maybe if you're in metro Chicago
[00:28:24] Maybe that's different than you know a more rural area Sarah is not necessarily in a rural area
[00:28:28] But a much smaller group of cities
[00:28:31] So perhaps the you know, but I don't know maybe the competition is even more fierce where she is too
[00:28:35] But regardless it's a heck of a good idea and you just got to go try it for like two years
[00:28:40] I'd say if you do it for two years I'd be shocked if you didn't get and use her letter
[00:28:44] She's going to give you the exact letter. She uses that literally wins business
[00:28:47] So please reach out to her that is awesome
[00:28:51] So so now that now that things have changed with respect to where the market is
[00:28:58] What are some of the things so in addition to expires? You know, what are you doing for a
[00:29:03] referral perspective like how are you staying in touch with your sphere?
[00:29:08] So the biggest thing that I do after every closing is add
[00:29:12] Any of the clients on social media. It's the best way to keep in touch and to be you always want to be top of my
[00:29:17] Awareness so when someone asks hey, who's the REALTOR you would call?
[00:29:21] I'm number one the biggest thing that I didn't want to happen is that we closed the transaction and they never hear from me again
[00:29:27] And five years later what was her name again? And I don't want that
[00:29:31] So I
[00:29:32] Another thing that I do is if I have clients that maybe I sold a house to them five years ago and they got married
[00:29:39] I'll
[00:29:40] I don't know if you know what small woods is, but it's a it's an online
[00:29:44] It if there's a wedding photo it goes in a wood frame and it's customized to them and you can make them any size
[00:29:50] And so whether they live here or they live some they've moved away
[00:29:53] We'll mail that to their house and it's probably I don't know 50 or 60 dollars maybe so it's not the cheapest
[00:29:59] But it's also not the most expensive and it has the biggest impact because it's so emotional. It's oh my gosh
[00:30:06] This is our family. It's it's a great thing to hang in their house
[00:30:09] So how do you get the photo? How do you get the photo?
[00:30:12] If they post it on Facebook
[00:30:14] Oh, I see so you so you don't ask for it you just search through social media
[00:30:18] You see if they have some sort of engagement photo or wedding photo or something that they seem to think is is important to them
[00:30:25] And then you take that photo and you just do this without them even knowing and you just
[00:30:29] Shows up on their door. It just shows up at their door and says
[00:30:32] Congratulations wishing you a lifetime of happiness and same with babies. That's another big one
[00:30:38] so I
[00:30:39] The biggest blessing I think in real estate is clients that become friends and not everyone of course, but
[00:30:46] The majority I would say become my friend and it's important to be a good friend
[00:30:51] It's not just real estate, but I also want to be the person that if they move here and they know no one
[00:30:56] Hey, who's a good doctor? Where should I get my hair done?
[00:30:59] Just little things that I can maybe answer for them or give them suggestions
[00:31:03] I want to be there go to and all things real estate
[00:31:06] By the way, Sarah is the go to for dermatologist in her area because of her
[00:31:11] Sorry, that was that was an easy joke. I just
[00:31:14] But but it is but it is a really good point by the way
[00:31:17] Everybody get your annual dermatologist appointment and in fact here's a little pro tip
[00:31:21] Don't leave the office before scheduling the next years because you're gonna forget
[00:31:25] That's what I do every year never leave a doctor's office without scheduling the next appointment
[00:31:29] Otherwise if you're like me you won't remember
[00:31:31] But it's really important because if I was moving to the Quad Cities
[00:31:34] I would need a dermatologist. I would need
[00:31:36] You know a bunch of doctors right a general person. I might need a sports medicine person
[00:31:41] And I wouldn't know
[00:31:43] Where to go. I mean, I guess you know you can look that up online sort of but I'd much rather have referrals
[00:31:48] And so you want to be the I'm guessing you want to be the hub of all things
[00:31:54] Uh, you know service related whether it's real estate or not for your clients is that accurate? Yes. Yes
[00:32:00] And mostly it's I want to keep the relationship going after closing
[00:32:04] So that six months down the road three years down the road whatever it is we're still touching base the whole way through
[00:32:10] By the way back to the the the small woods um yeah the small wood idea which I'm looking at it right now
[00:32:16] I pulled it up while you were talking um
[00:32:18] Sarah does this on an anniversary
[00:32:20] But you don't even have to do it on an anniversary like it literally could be done at any time
[00:32:24] So it's something that if you're like I don't know on my clients anniversary is no problem
[00:32:28] Just find a picture of them send it to them randomly
[00:32:31] They will in fact maybe even not on their anniversary would be even be maybe more unexpected
[00:32:36] Although on their anniversary is is amazing as well
[00:32:39] But and that that's the other thing too is everyone should know this information
[00:32:42] You should reach out to your clients and say hey, you know
[00:32:45] I like to I like to know
[00:32:47] Wedding anniversaries so that I can possibly you know send something
[00:32:50] So if you need to get that information you can literally just ask your clients for it
[00:32:54] I don't think anyone would would say I don't want you to have that information
[00:32:58] You want to know what the children's ages are you want to know major life event stuff
[00:33:02] So did they get a new job did they you know what are they moving obviously is important
[00:33:07] But um, you know, these are important things because if if Sarah knows that somebody's child is you know a junior in college
[00:33:14] Our junior in high school while they're probably looking at colleges or or maybe you know depending on the family
[00:33:19] That that may be something they're doing so she now knows oh well
[00:33:22] Maybe I could do something nice for them
[00:33:24] You know when she's ready to leave for college or whatever
[00:33:27] The important part is she Sarah now has information she can choose to do something with
[00:33:33] Which is this is all the fun stuff of real estate too, right? Yes, right? Yeah
[00:33:38] I'm trying to think of anything. Oh closing gifts or another big deal
[00:33:41] I think a lot of times agents either forget or don't want to do that
[00:33:45] And it really kind of seals the deal for me. I feel like where I would say nine times out of 10 if they don't already have some sort of like ring doorbell
[00:33:53] I give a ring doorbell at closing and sometimes a gift card to a local restaurant
[00:33:58] I try to never forget kids and dogs. So they'll be we have a place called Freddy's Fritters here
[00:34:04] And it's a custom dog treat company. So we'll throw in treats for them or ice cream for the kids
[00:34:10] Something so that they know that I care about their family and I'm really excited for them on their purchase or their sale
[00:34:16] Yeah, I love that um again these are and these are things that don't have to be necessarily expensive
[00:34:22] Um, they could even you know be free
[00:34:24] There's certain ways you can celebrate people
[00:34:26] You know the things that are important in their life. It doesn't necessarily need to cost a lot
[00:34:30] But it is something that most of the other service professionals in that consumers life are not even going to know about
[00:34:37] They're not going to know about their anniversary. They're not going to know about their birthdays
[00:34:40] Unless they happen to know and they get that automated email saying happy birthday
[00:34:44] Um, this is a real opportunity to to really be able to touch somebody at like Sarah was saying at a deep emotional level
[00:34:51] And find out what's important to them and and be be there to uh to
[00:34:55] To celebrate with them and support them when they need it um
[00:34:59] I so let's talk about the basics. So what are the basics of building a real estate business because I
[00:35:06] Totally agree that this is the year to return to fundamentals because we we know we can't control the market
[00:35:12] We can't control inventory. We can't control rates, but we can control our our activity
[00:35:17] Um, in fact, it's about the only thing we can control
[00:35:19] So what are you doing right now just to stay busy?
[00:35:23] Yeah, um, so I try to just do the same things that I've been doing for the last 13 years and it's not rocket science and
[00:35:31] It's I think social media is so great because it's an easy way to stay top of mind
[00:35:36] But it's not everything and I see a lot of agents or lenders or whatever it is that are maybe all in on social media
[00:35:42] And they are killing it and videos and that's all important
[00:35:46] But then their sales don't reflect that so it can't be the only piece, but it's a big piece
[00:35:51] Um, so I try to just post stories and videos and different posts that are engaging and not just something that
[00:35:58] Oh, there's a boring house that nobody really cares about
[00:36:01] So I I guess it's as a new agent some things that I would have done differently aside from the Google reviews is
[00:36:09] I have a mailing list that's on an excel spread sheet
[00:36:12] But I don't have an email list and that is ridiculous
[00:36:16] I should and so that's something that I'm going to be working on and something that I wish that I would have done 13 years ago
[00:36:22] Emails not going away, of course, and so I think it's a big tool and a way to stay connected with people
[00:36:27] So that's a goal of mine that I'm working on another thing for new agents is maybe you're not super busy right now
[00:36:34] And I have some friends that got in the business in 2020 and it was easy. They just answered their phone and
[00:36:41] We're selling houses because it was such a crazy market
[00:36:43] Well now it's harder again and so I would join as many different networking groups volunteer opportunities
[00:36:50] It's all about at the beginning
[00:36:52] It's not really what you know because you don't know a lot it's who you know
[00:36:55] And so how do you pair those two things with who I know while I'm learning everything I should know
[00:37:00] Another really important thing I think is
[00:37:03] Learning the contracts inside out forward backwards because I remember when I was 24
[00:37:09] And a very seasoned agent would challenge me on something in the contract
[00:37:12] And I knew the answer and I knew I was right
[00:37:14] But it's hard to have that confidence
[00:37:17] So the more you can know the contract and say okay. Well page four paragraph nine talks about inspections
[00:37:23] And you might want to go back and read that it feels a lot better when you know it and you know it for sure
[00:37:28] So learning the forms I joined our board early on on the forms committee for that reason
[00:37:35] So that I could see how other agents were interpreting something and
[00:37:38] Every forms, you know different interpretation by different attorneys or whoever it is
[00:37:43] But I think the more that you can know the basics the better off you'll be in the long run
[00:37:48] I want to I want to talk about this so serious talking about joining her
[00:37:53] Volunteering serving on at her local association
[00:37:56] You can also serve at the state level and of course at the national level
[00:38:00] But the first place that people typically start is is their local level
[00:38:03] And so they reach out to their local associations say hey, do you have any committees that maybe need need some members
[00:38:09] And you can apply I know at here in Chicago for the association I belong to where there's 22 different committees lots of opportunities there
[00:38:16] And in addition to obviously serving the industry and and learning more about the contracts
[00:38:23] What also happens and I'm curious to get Sarah's opinion
[00:38:26] She also get to meet all of the other really great people in the industry who are wanting to be of service
[00:38:31] You get to develop relationships with them and that only will help you as you continue to do
[00:38:37] deals because you may run across a deal with that person and you know again
[00:38:40] Just having a good connection with them
[00:38:43] Being similarly minded being like hey, I volunteer at the association with you
[00:38:47] That is that is going to help influence indirectly, you know a deal
[00:38:53] Yes
[00:38:54] Yeah, it's I think it's important to meet as many agents as you can when you're new
[00:38:59] We as as an agent that's out been 13 years there's constantly new agents and especially in the last couple of years
[00:39:06] So not all of them make it and I think it's just the more people you can know the better
[00:39:11] Just from a sphere of influence standpoint
[00:39:14] Yeah, I agree I wanted to ask about social media
[00:39:17] Just one one thing about it because I know it's important to you you you don't over focus on it which some agents do
[00:39:23] But you mentioned posting content that was that was helpful
[00:39:27] What what types of content whether it's video or static posts are you posting is it more about your life
[00:39:33] And what you deal with as a non-reelter or is it more real estate related or is it a mix?
[00:39:39] Mostly real estate related I do try to throw in my kids every once in a while or a funny story of something that happened
[00:39:45] Just to make it personal
[00:39:47] I think people sometimes you can get on social media and it's all just real estate real estate real estate
[00:39:52] And when someone Googles Sarah to wolf REALTOR I want them to know me and so I'm trying to get better at video and
[00:39:59] That's kind of a goal for this coming year is to really focus more on just being out there for people to see me more
[00:40:05] Not necessarily the houses that I'm selling even though that's important as well
[00:40:09] Great so that that makes sense and I also want to highlight this point is Sarah is a top top producer
[00:40:15] And doesn't have an email list so guys you don't have to be up you don't have to be you you won't be perfect
[00:40:21] There's always going to be systems that aren't in place and Sarah's like hey 13 years
[00:40:25] I don't really have a good email list
[00:40:27] But that's a really easily solvable problem right she can literally just contact every single person she's ever done a deal with
[00:40:34] And so yeah, I'm just updating my records. I need that so obviously every problem has a solution
[00:40:39] But guys, I also want you to know that people at the very top they have issues too. There's there's things
[00:40:45] Sarah is is a crazy success and yet she doesn't have an email list
[00:40:49] And I'm not I'm not doing saying that to pick up or I'm saying it's a humanizer. Yes, right?
[00:40:54] It's not all perfect. Yeah, and it's always workable. Yeah, it's always workable
[00:40:59] It's always taking things and scaling and yeah, and this is where when you take a step back in your business
[00:41:05] And you say oh, there's the thing I don't have I need to work on that as opposed to just all the things flying at you
[00:41:11] customer service related during the day
[00:41:15] That eat up a lot of time and then it's hard to step take a step back. So important to look at all of your systems
[00:41:22] What
[00:41:23] Um
[00:41:24] Wanted to get one more idea. So if you were a brand new agent today
[00:41:29] Um, you talked about social media talked about obviously um building up your sphere
[00:41:34] What would you tell a new agent today to do?
[00:41:38] Join as many different volunteer opportunities that you can and that's mostly because
[00:41:43] In the beginning you might not be on appointments all day long. You're at the office kind of okay
[00:41:48] Twitling your thumbs on what to do. So it's a way to get out there because when you're new
[00:41:52] You might not have the money to donate but you have your time and so that that is the big thing that I would do is join as many
[00:42:00] Different committees or volunteer things that you can
[00:42:03] Google reviews you want them to come from your clients and things but even if you need to get a few from your boyfriend or your best friend
[00:42:09] Do it um, so those two things and then I
[00:42:14] From my own personal experience. I would do an email list right away as well as the mailing list and that's been big for me
[00:42:20] From the beginning as my mailing list
[00:42:23] Yeah, we're talking about branding. We're talking about doing repeatable actions that will over time um, you know
[00:42:29] Get your clients to associate you with real estate, especially if you're newer and you know
[00:42:34] It's easy to poo poo the um refrigerator magnet idea just because it's such an old idea. However
[00:42:41] If you do think about it you want something that they're going to see
[00:42:45] Constantly with your name on it and that is about as good of a
[00:42:49] A gift as any because everyone's in the fridge all day long
[00:42:53] So this idea of seeing your name constantly is uh, it really is a good idea that you know
[00:42:59] Not everyone puts fridge magnets up, but for people who do they want they they will see your your name and that's a good thing
[00:43:05] And I've done it for so long now that every fall I want to get to be honest
[00:43:08] My clients are like where is it when's it coming and then they post it and then I share it and so it's just kind of a fun thing that ends up paying for itself easily
[00:43:17] Yeah, I mean the downside is you'll have to do it the rest of your career the upside is it works
[00:43:24] Yeah, brilliant brilliant idea um well, I think this is a great start you've given us so much good information
[00:43:30] I think this is a great place to wrap up by the way if I
[00:43:34] Is is are you looking to add any members to your team currently?
[00:43:38] Or are you happy with with your production and just kind of just work on your own stuff?
[00:43:43] Yeah, yeah, no, we um, we opened a local real office called bicell build quatt cities
[00:43:48] And so we are looking to grow that as well as real
[00:43:51] And I'm happy to just answer any questions if I can help anyone
[00:43:55] So reach out to me send me a message on instagram or an email
[00:43:58] I'll respond and send you the expired listing or anything that I can help with

It'll link to it in the show notes Sarah DeWolf Q-C REALTOR on Instagram and we'll also have a link to our website which is Sarah DeWolf Realtor.com Sarah, I'm so excited to have you tell us you got into the market in 2010 Not the easiest time to get into the market. So I want to hear about what that experience was like because we have a lot of agents today getting in right now And it's not quite as awful as it was back then, but it is still a challenging time So tell us about how how you got started and why? Sure So at the time in 2010 I was in college and my major was psychology My dad was a REALTOR so I am a second-generation REALTOR He was a managing broker for our offices and said you should get into real estate And so it wasn't something that I grew up thinking that I was going to do and I he did it for 20 years And so I watched him and it I always was interested in real estate But I didn't know that that was the path I was going to go down However, I was I didn't want to do school anymore. I didn't want to get my masters or PhD and psychology does come in handy every day with real estate So it does it worked out so he Him and I worked together. We would do all of our listings together and buyers separately So it was kind of a we weren't really a team, but sort of we were the father-daughter team on listings And so it was nice because he he taught me everything I know And we would drive around all day to different appointments and I would listen to him and listen to 45 different agents calling him with headaches and so I felt like I was on a fast track to learning this business Which every day is different and now 13 years in I'm still learning things of course and each deal has different Different things that you've got to kind of work through So he passed away in 2019 And it was pretty unexpected He was he was in a surgery and my I looked at my husband and we didn't know if he was going to make it out of that surgery And I looked at my husband and said what am I going to do because it had always just been him and I He didn't die that night thankfully, but I had two more weeks with him and he did unfortunately pass away So I had to quickly pick up the pieces and I knew for sure that he wouldn't want me sitting around crying So I just went right to work and figured out how am I going to really do this without him So that was in 2019 and that year I had sold 12 million in sales and 2020 I sold 20 23 million So I almost doubled my sales. Thank you And grew it ever since then so I hope he's looking down and proud But he is certainly missed but how lucky am I that I had such a great teacher for 10 years Yeah, it's life is a mixture of um tragedy and fortunate fortunate events and it's just this dance of peaks and valleys and we all go through it um and Yeah, my my heart goes out to you for losing your your father We we're all we're all going to do it someday. We're all going to lose lose our parents and and it is oh it's a scariest thing ever But um I also you also Had some health issue yourself that came at a very young age and I'm If you don't mind sharing that I'm curious because I'm what I'm curious about is What how that experience maybe shaped you into who you are today Because it was a pretty serious one if you don't mind Yeah, absolutely So that I I had melanoma I had a mole on my arm that didn't look great But at the time I was 26 and that uh it's probably nothing and so I ended up going in probably way later than I should have And they they took the mole off and said oh best case scenario we caught it early stage 1 a Um you will remove it and then they said but because of your age we're gonna test a couple couple lymph nodes just to make sure Well, they did that and it two of the lymph nodes tested positive So for whatever reason the type of cancer that I had they could see actively splitting under a microscope So it was moving very very quickly So I quickly went from stage 1 a to stage 3b, which is much more serious So I had to do a lot of scans and luckily it hadn't spread past my lymph nodes We caught it kind of just in time So I had several surgeries and that was a that was a rough time It was I was probably three years into the business and so it was starting to get more consistent But not quite and so Between just being scared to death literally um am I gonna survive this and I was dating my husband at the time But we weren't married um and so that was about a year long of going back and forth to Iowa City to the hospital there and Just making sure that Everything was okay and thank god no issues sense and that was it'll be 10 years in February Well, but it changed my life. I can I can tell you that for sure Yeah, what what did she obviously you know Significant events like that do tend to change people's perspective or they're maybe even change their goals or They're you know the things that are they're important the things that are important to them their their values How did how did that change your you? I've always been a don't sweat the small stuff type of person But even more so now it's little things that aren't going to matter in five years or an agent just makes you so mad You want to call and yell at them or say this isn't right But is it worth it? Is it gonna change anything? No So it's just a matter of taking a day at a time and being so grateful for my health That at at 26 it hits you different when you start to think am I gonna make it And you really don't think about that and your 20 is very often and really without our health We have nothing so all these little things stressors in life if you're happy if your family's healthy. That's all that matters Yeah, I was having a moment last night where I was starting to judge myself Unfairly I was thinking about something in my life that I don't have or as much of as I want and I was cooking And I really enjoy cooking and I was uh making this meal that I'd never made before it was kind of a fun thing But I was sitting there going gosh, I don't have this and that and you know like I'm so I you know Such a loser whatever, you know the things that negative self-thought and I realized I said well But I have this moment where I'm cooking and why am I like I could enjoy this moment while I'm cooking I can get back to beating myself up later But I said I said boy I'm missing out on this fun thing I like to do just because I'm I'm you know caught up in this in this judgment So it is really important I think to monitor and pay attention be mindful of of what's going on inside of a specially around as you mentioned Like anger, you know, I I think a great rule of thumb in this industry and anger is going to come up because people just do goofy things and other REALTORS may do things that you don't like and your clients may do things that you don't like but I always say um I I don't make good decisions when I'm angry and I certainly don't have access to all my faculties And I can't make oftentimes the best logical decision So I think what you said was really great. It's like when you're angry Now that's not right really the time to communicate right settle down first REALTORS it's like Sarah says it may just be a small thing even though it feels big in the moment Give yourself a breath and then then respond let it go yes, let it let it or just let it go Let it go Yes, unless it's something where you can't let it go and you need to actually take action But most of the time most things resolve themselves, but Sarah Well, I want to learn more about you because you have to get licensed in two states Not the easiest thing or most fun thing to do but based on the geography of where you practice it is critical And so you have to sort of know how to do deals on two different probably emaleses I don't know if it's the same oh it's the same emalesce luckily it's the same emalesce Oh, thank goodness. That makes it look easier But you know, I want to talk you you did 117 sales last year that is insane In the best possible compliment I could give somebody You you knocked out almost 40 million in production and this is what you did yourself, which is crazy Let's talk about how you did that. Yes, you had a father great mentor wonderful REALTOR And you learned and developed your skills, but most people who even come from a family that that was in real estate they don't do a hundred and seventeen sales in a year So what's your secret not that there's a secret what's your what I hate to say that word what's the what's your strategy? Well works. Yeah, it's been so I I had systems in place when I first started that I've tried to tweak over the years As Sharon Sarvatsis says just because it's tried and true doesn't mean that it's working right now So I've advertised I used to advertise on Zillow that 10 years ago that was huge for me And I had a ton of customers come clients come in that way Now I would never advertise on Zillow So it's little things along that I've just tried to tweak and get better I should note that I also had a baby last year and with that being said I have an incredibly supportive husband and family and mom and to which none of this would be possible without all of them So it's not just me But I I really to think two big things that my dad instilled in me is to create Raving fans and that customer service is a lost art and I always remember when I go to a hotel and they go above and beyond Maybe it's my birthday and there's a bottle of champagne in the room and it's it's little things like that If you do more than what the customer expects Any a lot of I shouldn't say anyone, but most people could be a REALTOR It's a lot harder than I think what people think and it's hard to grow your business and I also don't think that people Sit down and say okay, this is my business. I'm not just selling real estate. I'm I'm creating a business and I'm in charge of that Working on the business as opposed to in the business in the businesses all the stuff I need to do now my clients My prospecting all of the activities and then on the businesses. Okay, let's take a step back and look at this as a business owner Where they're inefficiencies where can I delegate how can I make this whole process run all these processes run smoother? Yes, yes, and I guess it's it's been interesting from 2010 to now seeing the difference in the market and in the quatsities We're lucky because we don't see these big huge drops in prices We've been consistent as far as equity goes and so that helps, but it's also not a big It's not a huge town like Chicago, but with Iowa and Illinois. We've got quite a few people So it I guess it's just it's important to look at your business and see what's working and what's not working and always be tweaking those systems I think that oh go ahead. No I said um when I started and you're you don't have a lot of clients and I was 23 and so a lot of my friends weren't quite buying houses yet And there's things that I know that I did write and there's I guess advice that I have that I should have done I should have been working on Google reviews from day one. I can't imagine how many I would have Let's pause for a second So I want to I want to step in with this because um we have about 800 just under 800 agents that are firm And we didn't do much with Google reviews up until about maybe three years ago And now what we do is we send um a a a a the opportunity to do a Google review to every one of our broker or every one of our agents clients So that we you know we we uh we just say hey let us know what you thought of your REALTOR and and we went from having almost Almost no reviews to now we have I think six or seven hundred It's never too late to start everyone. This can work Go ahead. This this is a good story. So I Had a my previous brokerage they use testimonial tree and when I switched I lost all of those So I went to my google page and I think I had 11 reviews which is absolutely ridiculous for doing this for 13 years So I knew I needed to do something and quick So I have always been in a believer in mailings and not the traditional postcard that people are just going to throw in the trash I try to stick to maybe three or four quarterly something that they're going to keep on their refrigerator So in Iowa we don't have a professional football team So the hot guys are everybody cheers for the hot guys or they should So I sent out the football magnet and then I'm top of mind on their refrigerator all season long I've sent out grocery magnets all kinds of just different things But one thing that I did recently is I I needed Google reviews So I sent out some things saying I'm celebrating 13 years in business Thank you for all your support. I'm going to be giving away I think I did a solo stove of pizza oven a black stone kind of some cool things that I spent $1,500 But I also did gifts Yeah, I sent it to my mailing list which is about 500 people um, it's past clients, but it's also just my sphere of influence and I got 72 Google reviews So that yes, and so in my clients were so excited they they Wrote the review which probably didn't take a more than a minute and when we drew their name We sent anyone that filled one out. We sent even if it's a $10 gift card ice cream or something They got something But it was a good way to quickly grow those Google reviews because reviews are so important And everyone's going to Google you even if they're your closest friends They're still going to Google you just because they want to see how you do or what other What other clients think about you and Google is obviously top of the mountain for For reviews. I would say Zellos probably number two for where people find reviews So yes, it's a great idea And it also helps with SEO local SEO in particular meaning showing up on web searches when people are searching for real tours in their area Google you know can make a general assumption that if somebody's got hundreds and hundreds of five star reviews Odds are there probably a pretty decent Search result to serve up to to a consumer who's looking so yes google my business is the name of the platform Or I think they change the amount of things just google business But anyway get yourself on google Why would you talk about referrals because well? I'm going to talk about something that leads to referrals you said going above and beyond Can you give us a couple of examples of ways in which you do that that maybe you think not every agent does? Sure, so Most people don't buy in sell houses every day So a lot of times especially with first-time home buyers They're intimidated and really don't know what to do So I it's amazing to me how many agents don't do buyers consultations and that is a Must for me so when someone calls and they're ready to buy a house whether it's their first house or their tenth house We sit down to talk about their goals. I give expectations on the market What's what to expect and if you do an inspection and you want to ask for something please know that amends the contract So we don't want to ask for something small Because a lot of times buyers want to renegotiate or whatever it ends up being So I do different checkpoints through the process with them We start with our buyers consultation Assuming they're already pre-approved. We'll start shopping for houses as we're shopping I'm pointing out things. I'm certainly not an inspector But I see a lot of inspection so I can say hey, this might come up just be prepared Then we'll I have a full-time assistant shout out carry. I could not do this without her. She is amazing And so she does different checkpoints like when we get closer to closing It's hey Sarah wanted me to remind you to switch utilities and it's links to all the utilities Even internet cable all those things or and then two weeks after closing We send out an email saying hey just a reminder make sure you sign up for that homestead tax credit So I try to just make the process as simple as possible for them, but also Not to I don't I've never looked at my business as transactional I've always just said yes to everything and I think that that is In part of big I guess it's a big part of my success I see a lot of new agents that get so caught up in price point and I don't want to go show that 60,000 house Well, the person that's buying the 60,000 house has family and friends and if you can create a Raving fan like my dad said they're gonna tell all their friends and family what a great experience they had with you So that's been really important to me is how do I make sure that my buyers and sell Have the best experience and that I'm giving them best-case scenario worst-case scenario and enough information for them to make an informed decision So right now the market is thank you for all of that by the way That was all just exactly the way I feel about what REALTORS ought to do for customer service and going above above and beyond is It's it's it's it's what it's I think M Scott peck wrote It's never crowded along the extra mile or someone wrote that book But it's he's right. It's literally not that crowded on the extra mile And it doesn't mean you have to you know Sprints a mile for somebody it does not mean that it just means going a little bit beyond what they would expect You know, it's as simple as just knowing what's going on in your clients lives and reaching out to them from time to time to check in on them And ask about their kids or you know whatever they're dealing with as a family or business But it is the market has shifted so it we have interest rates in the eights at this point So if you're lucky in the high sevens and you know, there's the vast majority of homeowners in this country Have a under a four percent mortgage at this point in fact like I think it's like 90 percent have under a four percent mortgage So there's not a big incentive for people to move unless they have to so I'm curious about what you're doing to stay positive Stay productive um and just you know keep your business chugging along uh right now Yeah Social media I think is our biggest tool as agents and I'll get into a little bit on well With social media, I think that it is the most important thing that we can be posting to and people get so caught up in rates And obviously it's very impactful into our market But usually what I tell people when they get nervous about it is if you're comfortable with the payment The interest rates shouldn't matter too much and people sign up for 27 percent credit cards every day So if you love the house that is a great point So if you love the house and you can afford it buy it Always replace it by the way don't sign up for 27 percent credit cards everybody Especially while you're buying a house Yes, yes, and if you are somebody that doesn't pay their entire balance off every month uh then yes do not say But yeah, it's so absolutely right you're right the rate is it that important but what the rate can do is still drive people away Right so you know that the rate isn't that as an as relevant but the consumer might feel like oh I missed the bow to a couple years ago I could have gotten in for 2.9 So what is your does that happen do you do come across people like that? Oh, yeah constantly um and it a lot of people sometimes it doesn't make sense for them to move right now if If it's going to be a lateral move to a small even a smaller house based on a 2.9 percent interest rate then we just pause it It I guess for me it's The way that I've kept things moving is I try to remind people to not get their local Real estate advice from the news The news is going to talk about its doomsday and Houses aren't selling and that isn't true at all We still very much are in an inventory issue at least in Iowa and Illinois in the Quad Cities So things are selling really quickly So one thing that I've done well for 13 years is every Tuesday I send out expired letters So I go through the last seven days of expired listings and we know those people want to sell their house Or they wouldn't have put it for sale and sometimes Circumstances change But I would say that I I get I don't know two to four listings a year from that and a lot of times It's just they picked they just called any agent and maybe didn't have a good experience or maybe their house Just wasn't marketed properly But to me in this market at least here everything is selling so an expired listing is a really good way to get a new listing So I started that 13 years ago and it still works That's amazing so so I'm going to I'm going to break this down for anyone who's not familiar with what expires are So these are obviously listings that have expired and there are services that you can subscribe to for Really very inexpensive pricing That will get that will serve you up daily here are the expires or you can obviously look on your your MLS system and set up searches for that But it's a lot of companies will provide these you know these daily leads to you The problem is they sell those leads to lots of different agents And so what Sarah is doing that's very unique is typically when people hear maybe you should call expires is that calling process I'm going to call the the homeowner and that can work It certainly can work the challenges that homeowners probably getting a lot of phone calls Especially when those leads become available because when it expires all these lead companies push it out to all of the people that are purchasing them And so the person might get type phone calls in a day If you might be number eight and they're going to be like oh stop calling it has nothing to do with you So it's Sarah does which is really a lot softer is she sends a mailer out? Do you like a letter or postcard? What it's just a it's just a letter and it's add it's addressed right to them in handwriting But the letter itself is tight. Yes And so it's it's very simple to maybe three paragraphs of Just a note non obligation we can get together kind of talk about different strategies And it works and I'd be happy to share it with anyone that's listening So feel free to email or shoot me. I miss please please do that is so generous We'll provide Sarah's contact information in the show notes so you can reach out to her to get her expired a letter Although if you're in her market area, let's not do that. But anywhere else yet. No, I I'm only teasing There are no secrets in real estate But we are so grateful that you share that and so this is really smart and and I want to Break this down just a little bit further. So every Tuesday or once a week Sarah sends yeah every Tuesday Sarah sees all the expires that have come in in the past week and she sends this letter out hand writes the envelope because what what do we know Handwritten envelopes get opened regular envelopes get thrown away So hand write your envelopes inside just just you know a standard letter and And Sarah said she gets anywhere from two to four listings a year now that might not sound like a lot for sending on all those Mailers By the way a lot of these lead companies that send you expires can also send out mailers for you Although I don't know if they can do the handwriting. So Sarah does that manually, which is probably the better way to do it But you could technically automate it if you really wanted to But the idea is that this is still a cash flow positive marketing expense because You know if she's sending out mailers. I'm assuming it still nets you you know two to four deals a year It's got to pay for all of the mailers. I'm guessing easily. Yes easily. So it's kind of a no-brainer like there's no reason to not do it And it doesn't require that much work your assistant. I'm assuming does the majority of the heavy lifting there Yes, boy, that is such a brilliant strategy guys. She just gave you a basically And I something that should pay for itself now every market's different and maybe if you're in metro Chicago Maybe that's different than you know a more rural area Sarah is not necessarily in a rural area But a much smaller group of cities So perhaps the you know, but I don't know maybe the competition is even more fierce where she is too But regardless it's a heck of a good idea and you just got to go try it for like two years I'd say if you do it for two years I'd be shocked if you didn't get and use her letter She's going to give you the exact letter. She uses that literally wins business So please reach out to her that is awesome So so now that now that things have changed with respect to where the market is What are some of the things so in addition to expires? You know, what are you doing for a referral perspective like how are you staying in touch with your sphere? So the biggest thing that I do after every closing is add Any of the clients on social media. It's the best way to keep in touch and to be you always want to be top of my Awareness so when someone asks hey, who's the REALTOR you would call? I'm number one the biggest thing that I didn't want to happen is that we closed the transaction and they never hear from me again And five years later what was her name again? And I don't want that So I Another thing that I do is if I have clients that maybe I sold a house to them five years ago and they got married I'll I don't know if you know what small woods is, but it's a it's an online It if there's a wedding photo it goes in a wood frame and it's customized to them and you can make them any size And so whether they live here or they live some they've moved away We'll mail that to their house and it's probably I don't know 50 or 60 dollars maybe so it's not the cheapest But it's also not the most expensive and it has the biggest impact because it's so emotional. It's oh my gosh This is our family. It's it's a great thing to hang in their house So how do you get the photo? How do you get the photo? If they post it on Facebook Oh, I see so you so you don't ask for it you just search through social media You see if they have some sort of engagement photo or wedding photo or something that they seem to think is is important to them And then you take that photo and you just do this without them even knowing and you just Shows up on their door. It just shows up at their door and says Congratulations wishing you a lifetime of happiness and same with babies. That's another big one so I The biggest blessing I think in real estate is clients that become friends and not everyone of course, but The majority I would say become my friend and it's important to be a good friend It's not just real estate, but I also want to be the person that if they move here and they know no one Hey, who's a good doctor? Where should I get my hair done? Just little things that I can maybe answer for them or give them suggestions I want to be there go to and all things real estate By the way, Sarah is the go to for dermatologist in her area because of her Sorry, that was that was an easy joke. I just But but it is but it is a really good point by the way Everybody get your annual dermatologist appointment and in fact here's a little pro tip Don't leave the office before scheduling the next years because you're gonna forget That's what I do every year never leave a doctor's office without scheduling the next appointment Otherwise if you're like me you won't remember But it's really important because if I was moving to the Quad Cities I would need a dermatologist. I would need You know a bunch of doctors right a general person. I might need a sports medicine person And I wouldn't know Where to go. I mean, I guess you know you can look that up online sort of but I'd much rather have referrals And so you want to be the I'm guessing you want to be the hub of all things Uh, you know service related whether it's real estate or not for your clients is that accurate? Yes. Yes And mostly it's I want to keep the relationship going after closing So that six months down the road three years down the road whatever it is we're still touching base the whole way through By the way back to the the the small woods um yeah the small wood idea which I'm looking at it right now I pulled it up while you were talking um Sarah does this on an anniversary But you don't even have to do it on an anniversary like it literally could be done at any time So it's something that if you're like I don't know on my clients anniversary is no problem Just find a picture of them send it to them randomly They will in fact maybe even not on their anniversary would be even be maybe more unexpected Although on their anniversary is is amazing as well But and that that's the other thing too is everyone should know this information You should reach out to your clients and say hey, you know I like to I like to know Wedding anniversaries so that I can possibly you know send something So if you need to get that information you can literally just ask your clients for it I don't think anyone would would say I don't want you to have that information You want to know what the children's ages are you want to know major life event stuff So did they get a new job did they you know what are they moving obviously is important But um, you know, these are important things because if if Sarah knows that somebody's child is you know a junior in college Our junior in high school while they're probably looking at colleges or or maybe you know depending on the family That that may be something they're doing so she now knows oh well Maybe I could do something nice for them You know when she's ready to leave for college or whatever The important part is she Sarah now has information she can choose to do something with Which is this is all the fun stuff of real estate too, right? Yes, right? Yeah I'm trying to think of anything. Oh closing gifts or another big deal I think a lot of times agents either forget or don't want to do that And it really kind of seals the deal for me. I feel like where I would say nine times out of 10 if they don't already have some sort of like ring doorbell I give a ring doorbell at closing and sometimes a gift card to a local restaurant I try to never forget kids and dogs. So they'll be we have a place called Freddy's Fritters here And it's a custom dog treat company. So we'll throw in treats for them or ice cream for the kids Something so that they know that I care about their family and I'm really excited for them on their purchase or their sale Yeah, I love that um again these are and these are things that don't have to be necessarily expensive Um, they could even you know be free There's certain ways you can celebrate people You know the things that are important in their life. It doesn't necessarily need to cost a lot But it is something that most of the other service professionals in that consumers life are not even going to know about They're not going to know about their anniversary. They're not going to know about their birthdays Unless they happen to know and they get that automated email saying happy birthday Um, this is a real opportunity to to really be able to touch somebody at like Sarah was saying at a deep emotional level And find out what's important to them and and be be there to uh to To celebrate with them and support them when they need it um I so let's talk about the basics. So what are the basics of building a real estate business because I Totally agree that this is the year to return to fundamentals because we we know we can't control the market We can't control inventory. We can't control rates, but we can control our our activity Um, in fact, it's about the only thing we can control So what are you doing right now just to stay busy? Yeah, um, so I try to just do the same things that I've been doing for the last 13 years and it's not rocket science and It's I think social media is so great because it's an easy way to stay top of mind But it's not everything and I see a lot of agents or lenders or whatever it is that are maybe all in on social media And they are killing it and videos and that's all important But then their sales don't reflect that so it can't be the only piece, but it's a big piece Um, so I try to just post stories and videos and different posts that are engaging and not just something that Oh, there's a boring house that nobody really cares about So I I guess it's as a new agent some things that I would have done differently aside from the Google reviews is I have a mailing list that's on an excel spread sheet But I don't have an email list and that is ridiculous I should and so that's something that I'm going to be working on and something that I wish that I would have done 13 years ago Emails not going away, of course, and so I think it's a big tool and a way to stay connected with people So that's a goal of mine that I'm working on another thing for new agents is maybe you're not super busy right now And I have some friends that got in the business in 2020 and it was easy. They just answered their phone and We're selling houses because it was such a crazy market Well now it's harder again and so I would join as many different networking groups volunteer opportunities It's all about at the beginning It's not really what you know because you don't know a lot it's who you know And so how do you pair those two things with who I know while I'm learning everything I should know Another really important thing I think is Learning the contracts inside out forward backwards because I remember when I was 24 And a very seasoned agent would challenge me on something in the contract And I knew the answer and I knew I was right But it's hard to have that confidence So the more you can know the contract and say okay. Well page four paragraph nine talks about inspections And you might want to go back and read that it feels a lot better when you know it and you know it for sure So learning the forms I joined our board early on on the forms committee for that reason So that I could see how other agents were interpreting something and Every forms, you know different interpretation by different attorneys or whoever it is But I think the more that you can know the basics the better off you'll be in the long run I want to I want to talk about this so serious talking about joining her Volunteering serving on at her local association You can also serve at the state level and of course at the national level But the first place that people typically start is is their local level And so they reach out to their local associations say hey, do you have any committees that maybe need need some members And you can apply I know at here in Chicago for the association I belong to where there's 22 different committees lots of opportunities there And in addition to obviously serving the industry and and learning more about the contracts What also happens and I'm curious to get Sarah's opinion She also get to meet all of the other really great people in the industry who are wanting to be of service You get to develop relationships with them and that only will help you as you continue to do deals because you may run across a deal with that person and you know again Just having a good connection with them Being similarly minded being like hey, I volunteer at the association with you That is that is going to help influence indirectly, you know a deal Yes Yeah, it's I think it's important to meet as many agents as you can when you're new We as as an agent that's out been 13 years there's constantly new agents and especially in the last couple of years So not all of them make it and I think it's just the more people you can know the better Just from a sphere of influence standpoint Yeah, I agree I wanted to ask about social media Just one one thing about it because I know it's important to you you you don't over focus on it which some agents do But you mentioned posting content that was that was helpful What what types of content whether it's video or static posts are you posting is it more about your life And what you deal with as a non-reelter or is it more real estate related or is it a mix? Mostly real estate related I do try to throw in my kids every once in a while or a funny story of something that happened Just to make it personal I think people sometimes you can get on social media and it's all just real estate real estate real estate And when someone Googles Sarah to wolf REALTOR I want them to know me and so I'm trying to get better at video and That's kind of a goal for this coming year is to really focus more on just being out there for people to see me more Not necessarily the houses that I'm selling even though that's important as well Great so that that makes sense and I also want to highlight this point is Sarah is a top top producer And doesn't have an email list so guys you don't have to be up you don't have to be you you won't be perfect There's always going to be systems that aren't in place and Sarah's like hey 13 years I don't really have a good email list But that's a really easily solvable problem right she can literally just contact every single person she's ever done a deal with And so yeah, I'm just updating my records. I need that so obviously every problem has a solution But guys, I also want you to know that people at the very top they have issues too. There's there's things Sarah is is a crazy success and yet she doesn't have an email list And I'm not I'm not doing saying that to pick up or I'm saying it's a humanizer. Yes, right? It's not all perfect. Yeah, and it's always workable. Yeah, it's always workable It's always taking things and scaling and yeah, and this is where when you take a step back in your business And you say oh, there's the thing I don't have I need to work on that as opposed to just all the things flying at you customer service related during the day That eat up a lot of time and then it's hard to step take a step back. So important to look at all of your systems What Um Wanted to get one more idea. So if you were a brand new agent today Um, you talked about social media talked about obviously um building up your sphere What would you tell a new agent today to do? Join as many different volunteer opportunities that you can and that's mostly because In the beginning you might not be on appointments all day long. You're at the office kind of okay Twitling your thumbs on what to do. So it's a way to get out there because when you're new You might not have the money to donate but you have your time and so that that is the big thing that I would do is join as many Different committees or volunteer things that you can Google reviews you want them to come from your clients and things but even if you need to get a few from your boyfriend or your best friend Do it um, so those two things and then I From my own personal experience. I would do an email list right away as well as the mailing list and that's been big for me From the beginning as my mailing list Yeah, we're talking about branding. We're talking about doing repeatable actions that will over time um, you know Get your clients to associate you with real estate, especially if you're newer and you know It's easy to poo poo the um refrigerator magnet idea just because it's such an old idea. However If you do think about it you want something that they're going to see Constantly with your name on it and that is about as good of a A gift as any because everyone's in the fridge all day long So this idea of seeing your name constantly is uh, it really is a good idea that you know Not everyone puts fridge magnets up, but for people who do they want they they will see your your name and that's a good thing And I've done it for so long now that every fall I want to get to be honest My clients are like where is it when's it coming and then they post it and then I share it and so it's just kind of a fun thing that ends up paying for itself easily Yeah, I mean the downside is you'll have to do it the rest of your career the upside is it works Yeah, brilliant brilliant idea um well, I think this is a great start you've given us so much good information I think this is a great place to wrap up by the way if I Is is are you looking to add any members to your team currently? Or are you happy with with your production and just kind of just work on your own stuff? Yeah, yeah, no, we um, we opened a local real office called bicell build quatt cities And so we are looking to grow that as well as real And I'm happy to just answer any questions if I can help anyone So reach out to me send me a message on instagram or an email I'll respond and send you the expired listing or anything that I can help with That's awesome And if you're an agent in the in the quads cities and it maybe isn't getting the help that they deserve or need Reels an awesome company too. I'm a big fan of theirs and they have some cool Incent of set other firms typically don't have um, so give reach out to Sarah She will have all of her contact information in the show notes and also please follow her on instagram Which is Sarah de wolf qc REALTOR again that'll be in the show notes as well and visit her website which is um Sarah just lost you said I'm sorry.
