[00:04:57] dot at Mary Ann dot Gillespie for Instagram link in the show notes to the website and her socials. Mary Ann,
[00:05:04] welcome. Thank you so much for having me. I'm super excited to share some great tidbits before
[00:05:09] the holiday season. So let's get this rolling. I love it. Well, I have to tell you I'm definitely
[00:05:14] intimidated because Iron Man athletes, that's just a whole nother level of physical fitness that I
[00:05:20] will likely not ever get to. So I really admire people who could do that. And I know, because just
[00:05:28] the sheer amount of training it takes to do just that is almost its own job in and of itself. So I
[00:05:35] really applaud you for not only having your own business, your own coaching company, and oh,
[00:05:39] by the way, I do this like incredibly hard thing, you know, physically. I just had a friend who
[00:05:45] did the one in, is there one in Antarctica? Is that right? There's, I think there is. Yeah,
[00:05:49] he did an Iron Man down there. Anyway, it's crazy this stuff that we have and it's like it's really
[00:05:56] interesting. And you know, the funny thing that I always like to share with people is that never say
[00:06:00] never. That's true. You're right. Because I would tell you I was 300 pounds and I used to be,
[00:06:05] yeah, five years ago. Yeah, out of here. Oh, yeah, five years ago, I was 300 pounds. And I ended
[00:06:10] up just deciding. I was like, I think I just, you know, everything's great business and all the
[00:06:14] and I was like, it's time to transform the physical aspect of my and I was like, I woke up and I was
[00:06:20] like, that's it. I'm like, I'm going to start the journey at hard five coaches, lost 150 pounds. And
[00:06:25] then within a few years, I became a championship world champ. So that, that's amazing. And if those of
[00:06:31] you who are listening, you probably can't see Marianne, of course, if you're listening, you would not
[00:06:35] suspect that she was ever 300 pounds. So that is truly made my jaw dropped when you said that. That
[00:06:40] is truly remarkable. And again, not just losing the weight because that's that's just one part of it.
[00:06:46] But then actually being so physically fit that you can do essentially just about the most difficult
[00:06:51] physical activity, you know, sort of, you know, sort of challenges or competitions that we even have.
[00:06:58] So amazing that you are that is super inspiring. Yeah, but but you're right because I, you know,
[00:07:04] I tell you look, you know, I'm not a coach, but I will tell people if you make 2025 the year of
[00:07:11] physical health and you don't have to run, of course, Iron Man, you know, we a lot of us just
[00:07:16] wouldn't have the time or the ability to do that. But do something for your physical health that
[00:07:21] you maybe didn't do this year because I didn't, I only started exercising like really like lifting
[00:07:27] weights. I have a trainer because it's the only way I'll do it. I yeah, four and a half years ago,
[00:07:32] I finally like, I guess I'm just going to have to pay to do this because otherwise, I'm just going
[00:07:37] to keep thinking I should do it. I should do it. And I know if it's if I hang somebody, I'm going to show
[00:07:41] up. And so I've been with my trainer now for almost five years. And again, it doesn't make me a hero,
[00:07:45] but you're right. It does. I never thought that even I would be able to do that. So, um, well,
[00:07:50] they're truly truly inspiring. So I hope everyone who's everyone who's listening, by the way, everybody
[00:07:54] has improvements to make with their with their physical body. And the way that I say this is,
[00:07:59] or the way that I think about it is energy. Like you want the energy because somebody asked me,
[00:08:04] I was in a meeting with some some, I'm in this other organization and that I just work out three
[00:08:09] times a week. I don't really go that crazy. But he said, gosh, you know, you're doing so much physically.
[00:08:14] Why do you do this? And I said, well, I don't care about how I look. Um, as far as like muscles or
[00:08:19] whatever, I said, I just, I just need the energy to get through the day. Like it's like about,
[00:08:24] about energy. And I know what it's like to not have that energy. And it makes everything so much harder.
[00:08:30] It really does. Yeah. You're 100% right. That's all it's like, it's not even about like the physical
[00:08:36] aspect of it. I'm competitive. So I mean, it's, there is no gray here. It's always like all in or all
[00:08:41] it. Sure. And so that's obvious. But at the end of the day, I'm like, no, I mean, it's not about,
[00:08:46] yeah, I don't think that if you make it about the physical fitness, like, you know, yes, it's
[00:08:50] the energy. And it's like getting those endorphins going. And yeah, that's, that's one of the
[00:08:54] most important things. I can't imagine like I can tell the difference between a day of working,
[00:08:58] where I started with a work at versus a day that I skipped a work at. Oh boy, it's like,
[00:09:03] it's like black and white. It's like two different colors. 100% and again, you know, for people
[00:09:08] listening who go, why don't have time to exercise? Okay, I get it. But at least get enough sleep.
[00:09:12] Like at least do that or at least, you know, prep your meals so that you're not making decisions
[00:09:17] when you're stressed about what you want to eat or sorry, you're stressed about work. And then
[00:09:21] you have to eat because I know if you're like me, I don't trust myself to make good eating
[00:09:26] decisions most of the time. So I have to prep everything ahead of time because I know myself and
[00:09:31] I will go straight to the candy and other things. But again, we can all think about, you know,
[00:09:35] make this next year, like even if it's not, I need to run a marathon. Maybe it's just, hey, I want
[00:09:40] to, you know, start walking more and doing 10,000 steps a day, whatever. Yeah. So boy, I suspect,
[00:09:46] and again, I don't want to, we're talking about this a lot, but I suspect if everyone
[00:09:51] focused just a little bit more on their physical health, if you're not currently focused as much on
[00:09:55] it as you prefer to be, if you were able to find the motivation to do that, I bet it would transform
[00:10:00] your business just sort of by default of having more, you know, good endorphins flowing through
[00:10:06] you, which would probably lead you to more energy, which would probably mean you could do more for your
[00:10:09] business. So this is all kind of common sense. We all understand. It's common sense, but it's also like,
[00:10:14] it's the, you know, I have a very big philosophy about strong mind, strong body. And it's like,
[00:10:18] some people think you have to crush goals with workouts. And I'm like, no, really what it comes
[00:10:22] down to is like sometimes the, the ability to just get out of bed and get to the gym and do it,
[00:10:27] and being consistent, that gives you a very strong mindset, because it's like, you don't have to
[00:10:31] have the perfect body, or you don't have to have the perfect workout, and you don't have to have
[00:10:34] a competition like, like I do, you don't have to have all that. The win for a lot of people is saying,
[00:10:39] hey, like I made it. I'm consistent. I am like, you know, I'm getting there. And that gives you a
[00:10:44] strong mind, because it's disciplined. Discipline is what it takes to get to the gym. Regardless of
[00:10:48] the performance that you have, it takes a lot of discipline. When it's easier to sit on a couch,
[00:10:52] it's easier to grab a bag of chips. It's easier to do all that stuff. So, so that is like, I don't
[00:10:57] care what you do with a gym. If you actually get your butt there, or if you get out to do a walk
[00:11:01] every day and you're consistent and you, you're doing things like that, that gives you a very
[00:11:05] strong mindset, because you're able to make a choice that is very tough to make, regardless,
[00:11:10] because who has the time to do all these workouts and do physical fitness. But if you're making that,
[00:11:14] that's your discipline. And discipline will give you a very strong mindset in business. So,
[00:11:19] it's great. It's like a win. Win. It's kind of like that. There's a great, great YouTube video about,
[00:11:23] you know, if the only thing I do today is like, make my bed, then you know, that's a win, right?
[00:11:28] By the way, that is absolutely true. If that's all you can muster up in a day. Hey, that's
[00:11:33] something. And it's a win. It's a win. And it's important to celebrate all the wins. You know,
[00:11:39] it's so it's funny. I was thinking about one of the things I like about physical fitness. One of
[00:11:43] the things that I dislike the most, but is the best for me about physical fitness is especially with
[00:11:48] weightlifting is it, if I do it correctly, everything, every time I do a particular set of whatever
[00:11:55] muscle I'm exercising, it's going to be the hardest thing I've ever done at that moment.
[00:12:00] To that moment, that's pretty much how it works. And so, you know, and that stinks every time it
[00:12:05] stinks to do to do pushups until you basically can't do another one. Nobody, it's not fun. It doesn't
[00:12:10] feel good yet. It does build resiliency, right? And all of a sudden, like you were saying, you know,
[00:12:15] all the sudden you're running an iron man and you're like, my bed, I bet I have, you know,
[00:12:20] can do anything in my business now. If I can transform my body like that, I can transform
[00:12:24] anything. So it's really, really inspiring. Okay, let's talk about, let's talk about 2025,
[00:12:29] because it is the end of the year. This will come out before the, before the new year. And I
[00:12:35] would love for our audience to just start to think about how to have a really great 2025. We know
[00:12:40] it's a tough time right now. It's just, you know, things are goofy. Customer trust is down a bit.
[00:12:47] Of course, rates are not exactly where they were and they're probably never going to be.
[00:12:51] Listings aren't quite as prevalent as they were. People are locked into these 3% mortgages and
[00:12:56] aren't probably going anywhere for a while. And so there's just a lot of it's the doldrum and
[00:13:01] it's the holidays where the holidays are incredibly stressful. I know they're fun and exciting too,
[00:13:06] but we don't talk about how hard the holidays are enough and they are. So I want us to, to maybe
[00:13:12] this could be some some really, you know, hey, if you're not, if you're having to deal with family
[00:13:16] right now, because it's the holidays and you're like, uh, which by the way, totally normal.
[00:13:22] This might be a good fun little exercise to get out of that and think about what we can do
[00:13:27] proactively. So we can have a great 2025. So let's talk about it. What, you know, as a coach,
[00:13:32] what are some of the trends that you're seeing right now with your clients?
[00:13:37] Such a great question. I think you're going to see. So, you know, if I was to measure up,
[00:13:41] okay, I always laugh about this. I remember I'll never forget it. I look at the sequence of how
[00:13:46] everything's. I think COVID was the best thing that happens in the real estate industry. I really do,
[00:13:51] not the best for the economy, but for our industry, I think it was really good. I was looking at,
[00:13:55] you know, everybody in 2019 right before COVID hit. I remember I was sitting, I was in Egypt.
[00:14:01] I take a big trip every Christmas and New Year's. I'm on a camel. I'm in Egypt. I literally have
[00:14:06] like, I was celebrating New Year's on on there. It was 2020 New Year's Day and I took a picture on
[00:14:11] a camel in front of the pyramids and I was like, hashtag, thanks so much 2019. Let's cross
[00:14:15] 2020. Little did I know like 30 days later. I was like, what? I was like talking about
[00:14:21] terror. We all hibernated for a few years after that. Yeah, I was sitting there going like as I
[00:14:26] coached to REALTORS, I was like, you've got to be kidding. Like this is not, they're shutting all
[00:14:29] markets down like with a pandemic across the world. What a terrible job to have. And I was like,
[00:14:35] this is going to be hard. And so, you know, when I ended up happening, though, I said, I thought,
[00:14:39] wow, like, had I known that, you know, we thought 2020, you know, COVID was going to be the hard
[00:14:44] years. How did I know? So 2023 was a recovery, but 2024 was harder than everything. So 2024 was
[00:14:51] probably, I would say now that the year's almost over, I can actually say, you know what? We kept
[00:14:55] our clients in a tunnel. We didn't want them to really see anything outside of that tunnel. We're
[00:14:59] like, let's just stay focused on our targets and like, let's not, let's not even know what other
[00:15:03] agents are doing. So we just fed them fed them fed them positive positive positive positive.
[00:15:07] Kept them in a tunnel and we saw production escalate like you've never seen before. So one of the
[00:15:12] things that we really worked on, which I think is very impressive, is, you know, keeping them in that
[00:15:16] tunnel. But then I think the biggest trend that we're seeing because of all these changes is you
[00:15:22] said it earlier, you said consumers trust is down. So you have to remember trust is built by relationships.
[00:15:28] You know, and so we're seeing a massive and we've been preaching this for good six months. Our
[00:15:33] studies and surveys and everything that we're seeing shows that the people that we're succeeding and
[00:15:38] we had 98% of our clients outperform this year than any of their previous years. So we're very proud
[00:15:43] of that. But what we did is we funneled into their heads relationships. If you have a transactional
[00:15:49] based business versus a relationship based business, you are, you are definitely not going to succeed.
[00:15:54] You need to move away from being transactional based and move into being relationship based,
[00:15:58] which is a K a almost old school real estate and stop hiding behind technology. Use it, but don't
[00:16:04] hide behind it. Don't hide behind AI to do all your heavy lifting. You've got to remember that
[00:16:09] there's human beings on the other side and you need to connect with them. And if you, and that is a
[00:16:14] very, very, very challenging thing for a lot of people to understand. So you've got to build those
[00:16:18] relationship based business and any of our clients who are focused on relationships and how they're
[00:16:22] building them. Are you appreciating them? What are you doing over the holiday season to build
[00:16:27] relationships? How often are you picking up a phone and talking to people? You need to remember is
[00:16:32] that when trust is low, relationships need to be even higher. You need to build the trust. And
[00:16:38] that's got to happen or your business will take a hit. Well, let's talk about the benefits of building
[00:16:44] a building strong relationships because of course, people talk about how to do that. I do want to
[00:16:48] talk about that, but I want to make the case because I think people know that expression, not being
[00:16:53] transactional, being relational, deepening relationships. But let's talk about the actual benefits of
[00:17:01] why that's a good idea. And I don't mean to sound flippant or I really think it's important that
[00:17:06] we really drill about like, why is that important? Not just because it feels good and it's cool
[00:17:10] and people like it. But what, you know, let's talk about why I believe in if that you can demonstrate
[00:17:17] care to somebody that you care about them as a human and not just, you know, of course, the
[00:17:22] business side of it, your business relationship with them, but also whatever other parts of their
[00:17:27] life they're willing to share with you. And if you're willing to deepen those relationships,
[00:17:32] what you'll find is that those people feel a connection, that connection is almost like a,
[00:17:37] like a true bond. And it sort of comes back to you in all sorts of other ways. But tell me,
[00:17:43] tell me how you'd sort of think about relationships. Yeah. So, so that's a great question. So there's
[00:17:48] two things that you have to look at as a business owner. If you're building, so I coach two of the
[00:17:53] top performers in the world, okay? And the first number one, and they're right underneath each
[00:17:58] other. So the number one performer is very transactional based. The number two performer is very
[00:18:02] relationship based. Really? Interesting. Oh, yeah, very interesting. And they're neck and neck,
[00:18:07] but here's the biggest difference from a CEO perspective. And then I'll cover from a consumer
[00:18:11] perspective from a CEO perspective, the relationship based consumer, even though they're not selling quite
[00:18:17] as much that CEO, they're not selling as much as the transactional based individual team.
[00:18:24] What happens is that their net profit is higher. So if you're building relationships, you get business
[00:18:30] easier. You don't have to buy it. You don't have to pay for it. It comes easier. So your net profit
[00:18:34] is going to be stronger. Okay? Right. Because you're not, you're not, yeah, you're not having to pay
[00:18:39] for leads as much. You're not, the transactional person is feeding leads, is getting leads through.
[00:18:45] You have to buy, you have to buy your clients. Yeah. Because you're not spending enough time
[00:18:49] building relationships with your existing database. So therefore, you're seeing a gap, a very
[00:18:54] significant gap. And that's what's actually coming down the pipeline is that it's a very big gap
[00:18:59] between the two. So that's one thing that we see aggressively. And I always talk about that. And
[00:19:03] I'm like, so if you're a business owner and you're thinking of building a team or building a bigger
[00:19:07] team, or if you really are just a person who's like, how do I net more money, build a business
[00:19:11] more relationship based and you won't have to spend as much buying internet leads. I love
[00:19:15] internet leads like anybody else, but you're, you're, they're being sold seven times before they
[00:19:20] actually land with a REALTOR that can sell them. So you're, you know, the, it's a multi-billion-dollar
[00:19:24] business that's built on you not building relationships. So, so that's kind of where that comes from.
[00:19:29] On the flip side, what you have to remember about building relationship-based business is that I
[00:19:33] think we assume in real estate that every single person is, and I'll tell you a story about this,
[00:19:39] that'll back this point up clearly for every, every listener is that what you see in real estate
[00:19:44] is that everybody thinks that buying a house and selling a house is fictitiously like the movies.
[00:19:49] Like there's a happy reason or it's a happy story. In, in the economy, whether you're in Canada
[00:19:54] or the United States, the economy is so expensive and the cost of living is so expensive. But think
[00:20:00] of this, one in three people get divorced. You know, you have over 35% of people sell their
[00:20:05] houses because they have a critical illness. You know, they're, that is a big one. An aging
[00:20:10] demographic that has nowhere to go, but they own their houses and they're, they're losing minds
[00:20:15] share and all of the above and their kids are forcing themselves. So that's not a happy experience.
[00:20:19] The unemployment, there's over two million people unemployed that can't afford to pay for their house.
[00:20:24] So there is, there is so many factors that are not pleasant of why people buy and sell houses.
[00:20:29] So here's the story. If you don't pick up a phone, if you don't call them, you don't have a
[00:20:33] relationship with them and you don't care or you're oblivious and you're living in a dream world
[00:20:37] and you have one message that hits everybody that like and you send a massive email out and you're
[00:20:42] expecting your database is it's not going to work because you're, they're seeing your happy life
[00:20:46] on social media. Social media is a highlight reel of happiness. So if you're going through a
[00:20:51] critical illness and let's say you, you've been diagnosed and you're, you're not going to live and
[00:20:55] you need to make arrangements and then you come to my social media and everything is peaches and
[00:20:59] and I'm not calling you but everything looks great in my world. It's easier to go to a stranger
[00:21:04] than to try to be like, wow, Mary Ann's got this great life. Look at it out perfect.
[00:21:07] Everything is she doesn't pick up a phone call. It just feels unnatural to call you and drop a
[00:21:12] bomb that I'm dying like and I need to stay planned. That's not a natural thing to do or if you
[00:21:17] sold the house two years ago to a really happy couple with kids and then something happened. Let's
[00:21:22] say there's an affair or something, you know, or maybe poor spending or something happened that
[00:21:27] they're getting a nasty divorce. They're not going to pick up a phone and call you. You were
[00:21:30] the REALTOR that knew them though and they were happy and you didn't call them for two years.
[00:21:33] They're not even going to, like they're not going to. It's easier again to go somewhere else and
[00:21:36] not embarrassed. So I always relate back to my my 300 pound story. So I was when I was 300 pounds,
[00:21:42] that's a physical change. You can see that I was 300 pounds. If you couldn't see it then,
[00:21:47] then I would, you know, then I would question your eyesight and so at the end of the day,
[00:21:52] I was all over social media. You could see that I was 300 pounds. I wasn't always 300 pounds,
[00:21:56] so you could tell. And then all of a sudden, so I have these two personal trainers that are
[00:21:59] amazing on my social media account and they knew me and they never ever ever said a word. You'd
[00:22:05] see that I was 300 pounds. That is not healthy for me. And so then all of a sudden, you know,
[00:22:10] I hired the trainers. I lose the weight and I become an RMA World Championship athlete and they
[00:22:15] reached out to me both independently and they sent me very scathing messages. They were like your
[00:22:20] terrible person, your supposed to support small business owners and your terrible and this is
[00:22:25] against everything that you believe in your phony. And so I said both of them. I said respectfully.
[00:22:31] Can I just ask you two questions before we continue this banter? And they said, yeah, I said first
[00:22:35] question. I said, did you see that I was 300 pounds? Like, did you actually physically ever see that
[00:22:41] and both of them answered, yes, I said, great. Second question. Did you ever reach out to see if I
[00:22:47] needed help? Did you ever want to reach out to me? And they're like, no, fair point then.
[00:22:51] Here's the thing. I'm like, I was embarrassed. I was humiliated. I was going through something
[00:22:55] that, you know, why should I? If it's your job to build your business, your career could have been made
[00:23:01] by literally coming to me and doing that. But you chose not to. And I was embarrassed. And now
[00:23:06] you're giving me, you know, help. And basically saying that. And I'm like, the relationships means
[00:23:11] when you see somebody who may need your help, then reach out to them and they didn't. And the same
[00:23:18] thing applies to people who own houses. If you know the economy is tough for a majority of people,
[00:23:22] and you know that not every situation is happy, don't assume that people are okay. Check in with
[00:23:27] them and just say, hey, I'm just checking in to see, is everything good? Do you have any questions? Can
[00:23:31] I help with anything? You're not the bar cell, but are you okay, housing-wise? And can I help you with
[00:23:35] anything? Yeah, I mean, social media is great for knowing when the people in your life go on vacation
[00:23:41] or when they have great dinners or their kids have recitals. And that's all, that's all legitimate
[00:23:47] fine and good. And you should celebrate that stuff. Yeah, you should celebrate that stuff with
[00:23:53] your clients. And you should also realize nobody's posting their fights, nobody's with their
[00:23:58] significant other, nobody's posting the financial troubles they're having or, you know, the fact that
[00:24:04] that maybe they're going through a depression or they're getting divorced. And so I was almost
[00:24:09] thinking as you were talking just with my marketing hat and maybe this isn't a good idea. But,
[00:24:12] you know, 56% and I think right now it's unfortunate statistic, but I believe 56% of marriages currently
[00:24:19] in the US get divorced. People married get divorced. It's a crazy high number. Yeah, it's huge.
[00:24:25] And if it was me and I was thinking about how I could differentiate myself on social media,
[00:24:29] and I know REALTORS like to do fun things like show themselves at the gym and that's all great.
[00:24:34] You know, I appreciate that. I think that's super cool. It does let me know that you're disciplined
[00:24:38] and you care about, you know, whatever. There's lots of cool things you can do with that. And I think
[00:24:43] it would be cool too to say, you know, most people who are married more than half are going to get
[00:24:48] divorced and we never talk about it. And I bet there's people on this feed watching this right now
[00:24:53] that are going through something. And I, you know, and maybe you've even been there before. I,
[00:24:57] you know, I've been through that. And so I would want to say, hey, if you're feeling like this,
[00:25:02] like, you know, like, let's let's talk about it or or I know people that you can talk to about
[00:25:08] this or I have a great divorce attorney. Should you need that? And again, it's not about pitching
[00:25:13] and trying to get business, but just reaching out in that way. And of course, you'd want to do that
[00:25:18] personally too. But I love this idea of, you know, sort of somebody talking about the hard parts of
[00:25:24] life on social media. Isn't it? Like we talked about that and I dropped it on on a previous interview.
[00:25:29] I said, I said, I think that to me, like social media is great. There's so many advantages, but the
[00:25:35] biggest disadvantages of fact that I said, there should be one day a week or like the first Monday of
[00:25:40] every month. Yeah, just the first. Just talk about our problem. Yeah, just like just it's called like
[00:25:45] B real Monday. It's the first Monday of every month where you're not allowed having filters. So
[00:25:49] nobody can use a filter. Not one appearance filter in existence. You cannot be us. And if you post
[00:25:55] anything, it needs to be a hundred percent real. Like you cannot post that, you know, everything's
[00:26:00] great. And here's my filter. I want to see the real stuff on the first Monday of every month. I want
[00:26:05] to see, guess what? Woke up kids puked everywhere or, you know, this happened or just got my bill
[00:26:10] can't pay it. This is great. What am I going to do? No idea. I'm going to Starbucks. Like I want to
[00:26:14] see real shit, right? I want to see the like show me what show me what really is happening in your
[00:26:19] world. Don't put on the filter. Wake up and be like, didn't want to get out of bed today.
[00:26:23] Force myself out. You know, or broke this or you know, just lost the client. Like we need to
[00:26:28] actually see that it's like, guess what? Terrible day. Like, you know what? No, we don't need that
[00:26:33] negative feed every day. The world would be terrible. But I think at the end of the day, I think
[00:26:37] the reality is that there's so many stuff in there. It's like, you know what? There's some great
[00:26:42] stuff. Hey, got in my car to an appointment. And guess what? You know what? Spilled my coffee
[00:26:46] all over myself. Now look at me. And I'm not using a filter. This is great. Like I just think
[00:26:51] that there's so many opportunities for us to also because what you have to remember is if you
[00:26:54] always post the highlight reel and you're always posting the great stuff, then the number one thing
[00:26:58] that goes wrong is is that the consumers, your clients are googling you. They're searching you.
[00:27:02] They're looking at you. They're doing all that stuff. So what ends up happening is that they don't
[00:27:06] feel comfortable. Like, you know, I lost my mom when I was young. And one of the things is this,
[00:27:12] I was like, I think about that. And I'm like, like, if I never post, you know, the tough stuff,
[00:27:18] then everybody's going to assume my life is perfect. So it's kind of like this, this catch 22.
[00:27:23] It's like nobody has a perfect life. And we're all going through stuff. And it's like,
[00:27:27] I always find when I speak to audiences, when I say to the room, I lead in with showing them my
[00:27:32] life story. And I'm like, you think everything's perfect. But I need you to see this. And the whole
[00:27:37] room just stops and goes, wow. And I'm like, yeah, I said, you know, you think everybody's had a
[00:27:42] perfect life. But because we don't share the tough stuff, we're all going through something.
[00:27:45] And it's really important to know that. And we're all of us have one significant problem in our
[00:27:52] life. That's very second. Every single person has something going on that they're probably not
[00:27:58] talking about other than their closest friends or family and maybe not even them. And so, you know,
[00:28:03] what I would love to see videos from REALTORS, you know, and again, it's not about wanting to see
[00:28:09] somebody doing doing something that's that hurts or that's painful. But I would love to see
[00:28:13] somebody coming back from a listing presentation crying going, I did not get I did not get that listing.
[00:28:19] It's really bumming me out. I'm having a horrible day. I'm going to I'm going to I'm going to
[00:28:23] if I threw it, but boy, this is a tough one for me. And I feel really sad about it. And that I would
[00:28:28] love that level of honesty. And I think I believe that we, we only connect to imperfection. I don't
[00:28:35] think we connect to perfection because we just don't under like it's interesting to look at, I guess,
[00:28:39] but we don't connect with it's not like we understand, you know, that that's a that's a real
[00:28:44] thing because we know our lives aren't that. So I think we connect more to the to the challenges that
[00:28:49] people are experiencing. And that's one thing that I would encourage our listeners to consider,
[00:28:54] again, you know, set boundaries and you don't have to share everything with everybody. But this idea
[00:28:58] of you might just, okay, you know, if you come back, if somebody were to post that, oh my god,
[00:29:04] I lost this listing. It was a big deal. And I really wanted it. And now I'm worried about blah, blah,
[00:29:08] you know, paying the bills or whatever. Um, and maybe you wouldn't say all that, but you would,
[00:29:12] you could talk about the disappointment you're feeling. Everybody can relate to that because every
[00:29:16] single REALTOR has lost a listing from a listing presentation. And it's bummed them out. And
[00:29:21] that's the kind of way I think that you can connect. And again, we're just talking social media.
[00:29:24] But let's talk about sort of, yeah, because you talked about and look, you know, we are, you
[00:29:30] were seeing, we are seeing trends, the newer generations are not, well, they are on social media,
[00:29:34] but they're not really, they're more absorbing content on places like TikTok and Instagram.
[00:29:40] They're not really communicating with each other as much. And so I, what I'm interested in is,
[00:29:46] as you were saying, going back to the basics and going to one-to-one, you know, picking up the phone,
[00:29:51] dropping something by, you know, in person, you know, just having coffee with somebody, those kind of
[00:29:57] things, you know, first of all, how important do you think those kind of connections are for like
[00:30:03] 2025? I think that the connections for 2025 are critical. We're suggesting that you pick up a phone
[00:30:09] and you call your database four times a year. So every quarter circle through and make sure you
[00:30:13] reach everybody every quarter, even including for that generation that is very social, because I
[00:30:18] hear it all the time from that generation that's like, okay, my generation, that's what I hear,
[00:30:22] my generation only likes text messages. Okay, first of all, I'm going to call BS on that. I'm
[00:30:30] talking about text messages, okay? They don't. They like to communicate with friends and other people
[00:30:34] via text messages, but if you really want to know the truth, who's going to tell you that they just
[00:30:39] thought, you know, diagnose with cancer on a text? Find me one person who's done that. Find me one
[00:30:43] person that's Texas somebody and the response has been, yeah, just, you know, a fan out partner is
[00:30:48] like, this is that and we're getting divorced. Like, it doesn't, or lost my job, you know, that,
[00:30:53] like, it doesn't happen. Basic, very low level communication happens on text. So I would say for
[00:30:58] that generation, whether it's a social media generation, you can send a DM and a DM is just as good
[00:31:04] to say, hey, I'm checking in on you. I want to just make sure everything's okay. Do you have any
[00:31:08] questions? That can work if your social profile is very good and you're very communicative. That'll
[00:31:13] work. But I would say, you know, pop buys and other things, those are equally as good, but take it
[00:31:18] into 2025 and start doing, okay, in a time where the economy's tough, go to a movie theater, treat your
[00:31:27] very low movie, right, and invite them out to the movie and just take them out for the night and be
[00:31:31] like, hey, you guys matter to me. And you know, why don't you know, top financial things are a
[00:31:34] little tough right now. So we're having a movie night and like do something like that. And that's
[00:31:37] just as good, but really diving in and caring about them and doing four calls a year will make your
[00:31:43] referral business go through the roof and you'll see that increase tremendously. I just think that,
[00:31:47] you know, as you head into 2025, you know, having a very specific plan to say, you know, if I went
[00:31:53] through a whole year and a great thing to look at is right now, what have I done in to celebrate
[00:31:58] the holiday season? You know, with all the people that know me, have I done a massive email out to
[00:32:03] just do a recording video and say, hey, it's Mary Ann. I just want to say happy holidays, you know,
[00:32:08] what, whether you celebrate the holiday season or don't celebrate the holiday season, it is a
[00:32:11] time to reflect back, look at the year, look around you, be grateful for everything you do have.
[00:32:17] And I want to sincerely wish you the best. And you know, I'm going to reach out to everybody in
[00:32:20] the new year, one on one and see if you guys need anything and always feel free to come to me.
[00:32:24] If you're not even doing that, you don't have a relationship. So start really looking and saying,
[00:32:28] how often am I communicating without asking for anything back with nothing back, you know, am I just
[00:32:35] checking it? Am I seeing if you have questions? And you know, if the rates are dropping, which they
[00:32:39] should, if the rates are dropping, have we done a circle check into people? Have we seen if everybody's
[00:32:44] okay? Have we helped out in any capacity? And so you really have to, you know, lean into that and
[00:32:49] then equally also build those relationships significantly in 2025. So be conscious of what you're
[00:32:54] doing. I would say 55 touches a year to your database. That is my number. If you're hearing anything
[00:33:01] less than that, you have to remember that there's like 10,000 on a regular day. This is not Christmas,
[00:33:07] not competing with Santa, but on a regular day, there's 10,000 ads that are running across person
[00:33:12] space in their span of a day with digital communication. So don't mix yourself up with those,
[00:33:17] stand out and don't be afraid to do 50 or more touches a year, you know, with your database,
[00:33:22] whether it's emails or texts or events or whatever the case is, lean into how can I communicate with
[00:33:27] these guys three to four times a month with great content and great knowledge so that we would
[00:33:32] professional, but we're answering questions that they might have. And that's a big difference because
[00:33:36] you're competing with 10,000 advertisements a day. So if you're only talking to them two, three times
[00:33:40] a year or even less than that and you're not sending anything out, then they're not even, you're
[00:33:45] not top of mind so you're not going to get the business. So let's get to 55. So let's just get
[00:33:50] really specific because I'd love to give this formula to so we know they're going to get four calls
[00:33:54] a year. So there's the first four. We know that you're if you have a newsletter or monthly whatever
[00:34:00] you're emailing out. Okay, so there's another 12 now we're 18. We'll say two client events a year
[00:34:06] and probably maybe you could do so now we're at 20. And now we could, okay, and oh, we could do
[00:34:12] on social media. Whenever they post something, hey, just got back from cancun. Amazing,
[00:34:18] that looked awesome. Can't you know, let's chat about it. I'd love to hear how you're okay.
[00:34:22] So maybe that's you do that maybe 10 times a year now we're up to 30. How can we burst that
[00:34:27] gap? What other things would you recommend to get a sum? I love that. Well, like I'll give you an
[00:34:31] example. So if you're looking at December or so let's say December January, you got to think a
[00:34:36] little bit outside of the box, but think of information that's cool, kind of fun, kind of interesting.
[00:34:40] So if you're area that you live in, you know, why don't you do a post at the end of December 31st,
[00:34:46] look up what was the highest selling priced house in your entire city? Into your entire area?
[00:34:52] What was it? That's fun. Call the agent and just and say the agent, hey, listen, by the way,
[00:34:56] I don't if you know, but you were registering as a highest selling listing at all in this area.
[00:35:01] I would love the opportunity. Would you mind if I send an email? I want to highlight that because
[00:35:04] that is incredible. First of all, every agent's going to say yes, nobody's going to be like, uh, no,
[00:35:09] don't promote me as that person. Now listen, I'm not worried about people using that person because
[00:35:13] they're not going to what I want to do is I want to get my database or I want to get excited.
[00:35:17] So I'm going to, you know, go on social media. First thing I'm going to do if I'm a social media
[00:35:21] person in my database is there. I'm going to put a post up and I'm going to say, guess the price
[00:35:24] of the highest selling listing in our city. That's the first thing, get the engagement up, all the
[00:35:29] above. But on the second note, I'm going to actually send an email and say, hey, everybody, you know,
[00:35:33] to my whole database, if I'm an email database, for someone to go, hey, everybody, just want to
[00:35:38] here it is. Here is the 2024 highest selling MLS house in our city. Take a guess at this,
[00:35:45] click on the link to see it, the video of it and at the end of the video, I will tell you
[00:35:49] what the price is. And so do it and be like, hey, I just want to let you know and click the video.
[00:35:54] That is a cool touch. It's just interesting. It shows that you know, what's going on and it kind
[00:35:58] of is an engagement. So it's good. So that's one thing. Then the other thing you want, and that's
[00:36:02] a January thing that we do. But we also do in January, every January, we instruct our clients,
[00:36:07] we say, do a worksheet. And a worksheet is really cool to send out to say, look, how many people
[00:36:12] are sitting in houses that have great equity or maybe they want to do something. Are you sending
[00:36:16] out a worksheet to say, hey, if you're thinking of, you know, doing something in your house,
[00:36:20] here's a great worksheet to work on. Fill up the blanks and this is what your equity is going to be.
[00:36:24] And then here's 15 different things that you can do with your equity or whatever, give a worksheet.
[00:36:29] You can write it through chat, you be to your code and just basically launch it through those
[00:36:32] systems and say, create me a worksheet that I can do. But let's send it out and be like, this is
[00:36:37] really cool. We don't do enough of that. So that's another thing that you can actually be doing.
[00:36:41] And so it's about giving data. That's really cool. And then February, you have one month of data.
[00:36:47] Why don't you jump in on February and do something really cool and be like, hey, 30 days, 31 days
[00:36:52] into the year. Here's my forecast on what we're seeing early in the game. There's great content.
[00:36:58] So it's all about like really hyper local. So being very hyper local with your information,
[00:37:04] but also being very creative and saying, don't give them recipes because like if you send me a
[00:37:10] recipe and you're my dentist, I'm going to be like, what the f is this? Like that is the weirdest
[00:37:13] thing I've ever seen in this industry. I'm like, why are you? We can all find our own recipes.
[00:37:18] It's like, it's not hard to find a recipe. I'm like, I got an email the other day from somebody
[00:37:23] and they're in a totally different industry. And they're just like, here's our favorite Christmas
[00:37:27] drinks. And I was like, I was like, it's a little weird. I'm like, thank you for sending that.
[00:37:31] But like, that's just a weird email. I'm like, that reinforced nothing. And everything that you're
[00:37:36] doing should be about, are you giving hyper local? Nobody cares about anything else. That is a very
[00:37:41] big trend. Hyper local. They want to know what's going on. If you have a farm area, are you going
[00:37:46] door to door in the month of January? Did you do a year synopsis 23 versus 24 for that for your
[00:37:53] neighborhood that you farm? Go door to door, introduce yourself. Hey, I'm Mary Ann. This is my
[00:37:58] farm area. I have a great report that I've launched. It's digital. So I'm going door to door. It
[00:38:02] gives you a really good snapshot on 23 versus 24. Here's what it looks like. This report is gangbuster.
[00:38:08] It's amazing. I'd like to send you a copy. What's the best email address? Love it. And I want to also
[00:38:13] go a little bit beyond so hyper local. I just had a thought and I'm curious to your opinion on it.
[00:38:18] I don't think it even stops with your physical local community. I think it goes all the way to the
[00:38:23] individual because if you know, in your C.R.M. if you know when their birthdays are, if you know
[00:38:31] when they're what their ages of their children are, if you know the birthdays of their children,
[00:38:36] if you know they're wedding anniversary date, if you know that, you know, whatever, those kind of
[00:38:43] life event stuff that happened every single year, you now have probably another five or six phone
[00:38:49] calls you get to make for no other reason than to be like, hey, I know it's your child's birthday
[00:38:53] today. Hope, hope he's having a great one. Just, just was thinking about him and you know, have,
[00:38:58] I hope you guys have a fun, a fun time. Like if that's all you did, here's what I did. This is funny.
[00:39:02] I did this years ago. Just it occurred to me and it's nothing to do with business, but I realized
[00:39:06] my friends, you know, my memory is so terrible. I've, I've, I've, I've been to a lot of weddings.
[00:39:12] I have certainly, I've been in weddings, of course. And I never remember like when some was
[00:39:16] anniversary. So finally I sent a thing to my friends, I go, it's just right back, tell me your
[00:39:20] anniversary date. And then I have a thing that it just pops up every time goes, hey, so in so
[00:39:24] is anniversary. And all I do is send a text because you know, they don't probably need me to call,
[00:39:28] but I just go, hey, tell you and your wife, hope you're having a great, you know, great anniversary.
[00:39:32] And they're like, you're the only person that does that. And it doesn't make me special.
[00:39:35] It was just an email I sent and I put it in my calendar and it's not that hard. And now I get to
[00:39:40] make them feel appreciated on a really special day, you know, for them, assuming they're, you know,
[00:39:45] who they're having a good anniversary. But, but the idea is that like those are things that people
[00:39:49] don't do that have nothing to do with real estate, but will do everything for that relationship.
[00:39:55] It you nailed it. And it's like it's the, it's the little details and there's a great book.
[00:40:00] It's an old book, but it's a great one. And it's a swim with the sharks or get, get eaten alive,
[00:40:06] I think is called. So swim the shark that in the life. And I remember meeting the author of the book.
[00:40:11] And I remember just watching him present and like just a genius. He's such a genius,
[00:40:15] but his whole concept of that book, although it's very old, but it's a great book,
[00:40:21] is the principle applies more now than it's ever applied where it's like, look, swim with the sharks
[00:40:25] is all about what it means is, and he always taught this and his name's Harvey McKay.
[00:40:29] Oh, yeah. He taught this like really brilliant, brilliant networker. And he always has said,
[00:40:34] the best people in sales are the ones who know their audience before their audience knows that
[00:40:39] they know them. And it's like, and if you can do the research, so if you have a, and it's so easy now,
[00:40:44] you're going on a listing appointment, for example, you're heading into that listing appointment
[00:40:48] or whatever the case is, and you're looking, you can do all this research, you can know everything
[00:40:52] about them. If you have a client, you know, it is easier. I have a team that I coach that literally
[00:40:57] has an individual on the team. They're only job. They're a VA. They're only job is all team members
[00:41:03] flag their social media. This VA is designed that if you have them flag. So if you're my client,
[00:41:09] I have you flagged, you're on my social media, any notification, I get notified, which is a lot
[00:41:14] during the day, but you decipher through it at the end of the day. And I look and I see and I'm like,
[00:41:19] oh, okay, and I'm like, perfect boom, boom, boom, boom. And I go, oh, look, he's got, he's got an
[00:41:23] opportunity here. But well, and I'm like, oh, all of a sudden, you show me that you took a vacation,
[00:41:27] you just had Putin and Montreal. Well, that VA, I will send that and that VA will be like perfect.
[00:41:33] And the VA will send it on my behalf and they'll send you something I'll be like, hey, you know what,
[00:41:37] just saw that you had Putin and Montreal, my hometown. How did you love it? Was it amazing? Awesome.
[00:41:43] And you know, you know, whatever the case is or all of a fact about Putin, did you know Putin,
[00:41:48] it came to do that? Like we'll just have fun with it. And if there's a special moment that you
[00:41:52] have this VA is designed for to pick up and the agent sends it and says, hey, listen,
[00:41:58] do you need a pair of us just, you know, just ended up, you know, taking this fabulous trip to
[00:42:01] Bali and post all these pictures, that VA will take a pick. One of your best shots, take it, print it,
[00:42:07] put it in something really cool, like, you know, what coast you're a mug or whatever the case is.
[00:42:11] And we'll just send it as a gift. We'll be like, hey, you know what, we saw your pictures to
[00:42:15] Bali or wherever. And just want to let you know, this was our favorite. So we thought we'd just
[00:42:20] put it on a mug for you so you could look at it yourself every day. Dude, that goes like here.
[00:42:24] Oh, that's next level. Yeah, it's it's absolutely right. And I have been to Bali, believe it or not.
[00:42:29] It is an amazing place for everyone who who I went, yeah, I went in the mid 2000s and I tell it's
[00:42:36] just a long trip from the US, but it is absolutely worth it. It even works from Canada.
[00:42:42] I wanted to also share a way that another way that people don't utilize as much. And if you're
[00:42:50] listening to our show, you've probably heard me say this before we always getting new listeners.
[00:42:53] I'll share it again. And it's always good repetition. I think it's the mother of skill linked in
[00:42:58] is great for knowing for for knowing things about somebody's professional development.
[00:43:02] I mean, it will it will tell you when they get a promotion at work. It will tell you when they
[00:43:06] switch jobs, it will tell you their work anniversary. By the way, they don't even know their work
[00:43:11] anniversary. I know I don't. It's funny every year on whenever I don't even still don't know
[00:43:20] I get them on linked in. I never read them because they're just little text messages for
[00:43:23] or they're sorry, instant messages or sorry, direct messages on linked in. And I don't know these people.
[00:43:28] If I was the person wanting to congratulate me, my phone number is not hard to find. I would pick up
[00:43:34] the phone and be like, Hey, I bet you didn't know it was your work anniversary. Anyway,
[00:43:38] congratulations on 14 years at Plubba. But you know, that's or it could be a text message too.
[00:43:43] But I'm saying these are like let technology help you with this because it can do a lot of that heavy
[00:43:49] lifting for you. 100%. 100%. So no, I'm gonna full agree with you on that one. Absolutely.
[00:43:55] Yep. So with your top teams, so you were saying, you know, one of the top producers is relational
[00:44:02] and the other one is more transactional. And they're just totally different business models and
[00:44:06] they have different profit margins. And certainly different levels of stress probably. I would assume
[00:44:11] the transactional person is terrified about that lead source drying up. Yep. 100%. They're terrified
[00:44:18] about the lead source drying up. And that's the race that you get to the bottom, right? So like
[00:44:23] that's exactly what happens is that you have this, you know, it's not that. And again, more units are
[00:44:29] sold by that transactional based team. And it's not it's not a bad thing. It's just sometimes you
[00:44:34] can build a business. You may have to take a pause in your business and just go, Okay, you know what,
[00:44:38] this makes a lot of sense. Or if you're seeing your profit and loss statement is out of control,
[00:44:42] then you need to do something about that where you're like, what am I missing? Because usually if
[00:44:47] you're high transactional, you still like the good news is, is that team is going to be very
[00:44:52] conscious in 2025 flipping the noodle because they have the transactions. So even if you've built,
[00:44:58] okay, I don't want the listeners to feel like, Oh boy, like I'm super transactional. Transactual
[00:45:02] doesn't mean you don't care. It does not mean that transactional means that you still care about
[00:45:07] the business. You still care about the clients, but you're so focused on turning more deals that
[00:45:12] you've missed the building a really good foundation with your current existing transactions and
[00:45:17] you're kind of just going next, next, next and you're just like a machine and you're still loving
[00:45:20] your clients. You're still excellent what you do, but you've missed the relationship. So you're
[00:45:24] actually you're not getting, you're missing a portion of the business and that's affecting your
[00:45:28] bottom line. So I would say the good news about anybody who's listening, who's saying that's me,
[00:45:33] which is a lot of agents is go back because it's not too late. I've worked with people that have had
[00:45:38] 20 years of transactional businesses and they come in and we're able to blow that all up and we're
[00:45:43] able to just really just do it and people don't care. See what happens when you run a transactional
[00:45:48] business? This everybody seems to think, you know, they get worried. They're like, well, you know,
[00:45:53] what nobody's referring me business or what's happening. I said, what you're seeing is, is that when I
[00:45:56] go to a dentist, I go to a dentist and he works on my teeth. I love my dentist. He's amazing.
[00:46:02] And so he does my teeth. He works on them, but I don't hear from him. He doesn't call me up and
[00:46:07] he's like, Hey, I was going like he doesn't check in. I was your teeth. I was like, when I need him,
[00:46:11] I'll call him. If he needs me for something, which he has for coaching, he calls me.
[00:46:17] It's 50-50, if I don't need him, I don't hear from him. He doesn't hear from me. There's only
[00:46:22] a call when I need. That's what transactional is. If they need you, so they're not thinking of you
[00:46:28] as a relationship REALTOR, which is okay. It's not a bad thing. They don't think you're terrible.
[00:46:34] It's just you did your job and now you don't talk to them. You send them an email here. You're still
[00:46:38] communicating. That's natural. So they're not looking at you like a beast or anything. They're
[00:46:42] looking at you going, Well, you know what? Maryanne didn't reach out to us. She doesn't really need
[00:46:46] us. So it's all good. There's no relationship there. So you have a chance always if you're
[00:46:50] offering a transactional business, you actually have a beautiful chance to change that rip off the
[00:46:55] band-aid and just be honest and call people up in the new year and say, Hey, guess what? Maryanne,
[00:46:59] I just let you know. I've operated a business where I've been so busy that I haven't actually
[00:47:04] paid attention to forming great relationships post sale and we're changing that in 2025.
[00:47:09] And we are going to do a much better job. So I'm going to send you a quick survey and the survey
[00:47:13] is going to, you know, ask you everything that I need to know. It's going to ask about birthdays.
[00:47:16] And the first use your favorite this, your favorite that an art company and team. We're going to
[00:47:20] up it and we're going to try to be more like Disney. It's not going to happen overnight,
[00:47:23] but we're going to do a really good job this year of trying to really pour into you guys because
[00:47:27] what we realized is that, you know what? We want to do better and we know we can. So we're going to
[00:47:32] start now and your database will be like send me the information like they don't care. They're
[00:47:36] going to love it. They're okay with it. If your dentist did that to you today, all we do is call
[00:47:41] you when we need to, you know, clean your teeth or do something and what we've decided is we could
[00:47:45] be giving you better information about taking care of your teeth. We could be doing a feature product
[00:47:49] every month with you. We could be doing a much better job of being proactive with you and we're not.
[00:47:54] So you know what? We're going to do that. Like I would love it if my dentist sent me something like,
[00:47:58] you know, I was on Amazon Prime Day and I was trying to get a water pick for my teeth and I was
[00:48:03] like, I gave up because I was like, there's like 20 of them. I don't know. What's this one mean? What's
[00:48:08] that? What's going to get? I would love it if my dentist sent me out an email newsletter one or,
[00:48:12] you know, saying, hey, you know, 2025, you know, what or Amazon Prime Day? If you were looking for the
[00:48:18] best things to get on prime, that would make my job as your dentist easier. Here's my top three choices.
[00:48:23] That would be a great email to get. Awesome email and I'll tell you, I'll give you an example of my
[00:48:28] dentist who did go, who did go the extra mile just recently. So no, no, no, this is, this is amazing.
[00:48:34] So I've been with him for like 15 years. He does something very interesting that most dentists don't.
[00:48:39] He does the entire cleaning himself. And I asked him, there is no, there's no tech. It is just him and his
[00:48:46] wife is also, they're both dentists and they both do this. And I asked him one, so I said, why do you do
[00:48:52] that? He goes, it's my job. Number one, he goes number two, I make more money because I don't have to
[00:48:57] pay another person. And my clients really appreciate it because no one's ever done that for them before.
[00:49:01] Anyway, but that's not even the cool thing he did because he's been doing that forever. I had to,
[00:49:08] I have a tooth that's cracked and I have to eventually get it extracted and then replaced.
[00:49:12] And anyway, so I haven't, I haven't done that yet. But the challenge was, so I looked for a place
[00:49:17] here locally in. Yeah, I was painter. You know, no, no, no, no, no, pain. Thankfully, no, no, no, no,
[00:49:23] the same thing happened. I had to get it out. No, no, if I was in pain, I'd get it done immediately.
[00:49:27] I this can kind of go wait for a while. But anyway, at the time I was single and, and he, he,
[00:49:35] so I went and got a quote from a place here and it was like insane. And he goes, don't, don't pay that.
[00:49:40] He goes, I, one of my friends who I went to, you know, dental school with, he's about an hour away.
[00:49:45] He'll do it for half the price. He's a buddy of mine. And I go, oh, man, that's amazing. Thanks so
[00:49:48] much. So I saw him. So I didn't end up doing it yet. But I said to him the last time I saw him,
[00:49:53] I said, you know, one of the challenges because I was single time. I said, is that I'd, because I
[00:49:59] have to put me under, I have to have somebody drive me home and it's an hour away. I go, I guess I
[00:50:02] could Uber, but that's really expensive or I could call my parents to come up, you know, from three
[00:50:08] hours away. And I go, yeah, I just have to figure out how to do that. He goes, I'll drive you.
[00:50:12] And I go, no, no, no, he goes, no, it'd be fun for me. He goes, I would love to drive you down
[00:50:17] there. He goes, I'll go shopping while they're putting you under because I don't care. And I was
[00:50:20] like, that's the most amazing thing a dentist has ever said to me. I will drive you to one hour
[00:50:25] each way and you know, doesn't, doesn't earn him one dollar. I'm going to him. I'm going to hit,
[00:50:30] I'm going to him forever anyway. I, I, I, but again, that's a great, that's a person who cares about
[00:50:35] relationships. Yep. And, and can you imagine how many people locally, I have told that story to
[00:50:42] here. Right. With his name. And I don't, I don't know how many people have, you know,
[00:50:47] joined him or whatever, but I tell that story to everybody and everybody's like, oh my god,
[00:50:51] that's, that's incredible. Race story. So those are the things I guess you want to create with,
[00:50:55] with your clients is yes, of course, we can't, you know, drive everyone two hours, but we could,
[00:51:00] we could call them on their birthday. We could, we could call them on their birthday. So I,
[00:51:05] I'm like 100% fine doing that one. All right. I love it. We, we have spent almost a full hour
[00:51:10] here with her. And we're going to do this again, because this is, so again, we're going to focus
[00:51:15] on relationships in 2025, which mean how many hours a day should somebody be focusing on
[00:51:24] relationships? So if I was an agent, if you were an agent right now and you were thinking about 20
[00:51:28] and you did no business to do, what, how many hours a day would you be focusing on relationships
[00:51:34] on a given weekday? That's a great question. I think you have to remember is this, okay? You have
[00:51:39] to look at, I have a client who wanted to make $100,000 a month. And so he wants $1.2 million
[00:51:44] by the end of the year. And so we did really good this year. And he hit his targets. But what he did
[00:51:49] is we worked his numbers out and we figured out that he wanted to work less than 40 hours a week.
[00:51:54] And he only wanted to work, he wanted four weeks off a year, all the above and he wanted $100,000
[00:51:59] a month. So what we figured out is his hourly wage was about $680 for hour. So what he committed
[00:52:05] to is he set the boundary. And so what we said is that the only way to earn that is he had to be
[00:52:11] spending his highest priority of time, which is lead generation and priorities on booking appointments
[00:52:16] and getting the deals. That had to be where he spends his time. So the truth is is that you have to
[00:52:21] really look at what is your hourly wage. He spends about, I would say, spend 80% if you're behind
[00:52:26] your goals and you don't have a lot of clients, 80% of your 40 hour work week should be spent on
[00:52:32] the highest producing quality things, not marketing. It would be how do I find clients' relationship
[00:52:36] based calling, visiting, you know, asking for the business. If you're on track with your goals
[00:52:41] and you're kind of like, you've got a lot of clients leading into the new year. So around 10 clients,
[00:52:46] 11 clients ready to go for the new year, then you're really going to be spending. I would say about,
[00:52:50] I say 20 hours a week, just maintenance thing and finding new ones and replenishing. And then
[00:52:54] if you're way ahead and you're like, I got 20 clients, I'm like slammed with it, then you're in
[00:52:58] maintenance at about seven hours. So it's really depending on where your business is. If you're
[00:53:02] lacking the clients, 80% of your 40 hour work week needs to go into lead generation, which is
[00:53:07] relationship based right now and just dive in. So you need to be having a significant amount of time
[00:53:12] spent on the highest priority of returns. Love it, love it. Marianne, thank you so much. On behalf of
[00:53:18] our audience, thank you. This was an amazing hour. We're going to do this again because there's so much

So anyway, dot at Mary Ann dot Gillespie for Instagram link in the show notes to the website and her socials. Mary Ann, welcome. Thank you so much for having me. I'm super excited to share some great tidbits before the holiday season. So let's get this rolling. I love it. Well, I have to tell you I'm definitely intimidated because Iron Man athletes, that's just a whole nother level of physical fitness that I will likely not ever get to. So I really admire people who could do that. And I know, because just the sheer amount of training it takes to do just that is almost its own job in and of itself. So I really applaud you for not only having your own business, your own coaching company, and oh, by the way, I do this like incredibly hard thing, you know, physically. I just had a friend who did the one in, is there one in Antarctica? Is that right? There's, I think there is. Yeah, he did an Iron Man down there. Anyway, it's crazy this stuff that we have and it's like it's really interesting. And you know, the funny thing that I always like to share with people is that never say never. That's true. You're right. Because I would tell you I was 300 pounds and I used to be, yeah, five years ago. Yeah, out of here. Oh, yeah, five years ago, I was 300 pounds. And I ended up just deciding. I was like, I think I just, you know, everything's great business and all the and I was like, it's time to transform the physical aspect of my and I was like, I woke up and I was like, that's it. I'm like, I'm going to start the journey at hard five coaches, lost 150 pounds. And then within a few years, I became a championship world champ. So that, that's amazing. And if those of you who are listening, you probably can't see Marianne, of course, if you're listening, you would not suspect that she was ever 300 pounds. So that is truly made my jaw dropped when you said that. That is truly remarkable. And again, not just losing the weight because that's that's just one part of it. But then actually being so physically fit that you can do essentially just about the most difficult physical activity, you know, sort of, you know, sort of challenges or competitions that we even have. So amazing that you are that is super inspiring. Yeah, but but you're right because I, you know, I tell you look, you know, I'm not a coach, but I will tell people if you make 2025 the year of physical health and you don't have to run, of course, Iron Man, you know, we a lot of us just wouldn't have the time or the ability to do that. But do something for your physical health that you maybe didn't do this year because I didn't, I only started exercising like really like lifting weights. I have a trainer because it's the only way I'll do it. I yeah, four and a half years ago, I finally like, I guess I'm just going to have to pay to do this because otherwise, I'm just going to keep thinking I should do it. I should do it. And I know if it's if I hang somebody, I'm going to show up. And so I've been with my trainer now for almost five years. And again, it doesn't make me a hero, but you're right. It does. I never thought that even I would be able to do that. So, um, well, they're truly truly inspiring. So I hope everyone who's everyone who's listening, by the way, everybody has improvements to make with their with their physical body. And the way that I say this is, or the way that I think about it is energy. Like you want the energy because somebody asked me, I was in a meeting with some some, I'm in this other organization and that I just work out three times a week. I don't really go that crazy. But he said, gosh, you know, you're doing so much physically. Why do you do this? And I said, well, I don't care about how I look. Um, as far as like muscles or whatever, I said, I just, I just need the energy to get through the day. Like it's like about, about energy. And I know what it's like to not have that energy. And it makes everything so much harder. It really does. Yeah. You're 100% right. That's all it's like, it's not even about like the physical aspect of it. I'm competitive. So I mean, it's, there is no gray here. It's always like all in or all it. Sure. And so that's obvious. But at the end of the day, I'm like, no, I mean, it's not about, yeah, I don't think that if you make it about the physical fitness, like, you know, yes, it's the energy. And it's like getting those endorphins going. And yeah, that's, that's one of the most important things. I can't imagine like I can tell the difference between a day of working, where I started with a work at versus a day that I skipped a work at. Oh boy, it's like, it's like black and white. It's like two different colors. 100% and again, you know, for people listening who go, why don't have time to exercise? Okay, I get it. But at least get enough sleep. Like at least do that or at least, you know, prep your meals so that you're not making decisions when you're stressed about what you want to eat or sorry, you're stressed about work. And then you have to eat because I know if you're like me, I don't trust myself to make good eating decisions most of the time. So I have to prep everything ahead of time because I know myself and I will go straight to the candy and other things. But again, we can all think about, you know, make this next year, like even if it's not, I need to run a marathon. Maybe it's just, hey, I want to, you know, start walking more and doing 10,000 steps a day, whatever. Yeah. So boy, I suspect, and again, I don't want to, we're talking about this a lot, but I suspect if everyone focused just a little bit more on their physical health, if you're not currently focused as much on it as you prefer to be, if you were able to find the motivation to do that, I bet it would transform your business just sort of by default of having more, you know, good endorphins flowing through you, which would probably lead you to more energy, which would probably mean you could do more for your business. So this is all kind of common sense. We all understand. It's common sense, but it's also like, it's the, you know, I have a very big philosophy about strong mind, strong body. And it's like, some people think you have to crush goals with workouts. And I'm like, no, really what it comes down to is like sometimes the, the ability to just get out of bed and get to the gym and do it, and being consistent, that gives you a very strong mindset, because it's like, you don't have to have the perfect body, or you don't have to have the perfect workout, and you don't have to have a competition like, like I do, you don't have to have all that. The win for a lot of people is saying, hey, like I made it. I'm consistent. I am like, you know, I'm getting there. And that gives you a strong mind, because it's disciplined. Discipline is what it takes to get to the gym. Regardless of the performance that you have, it takes a lot of discipline. When it's easier to sit on a couch, it's easier to grab a bag of chips. It's easier to do all that stuff. So, so that is like, I don't care what you do with a gym. If you actually get your butt there, or if you get out to do a walk every day and you're consistent and you, you're doing things like that, that gives you a very strong mindset, because you're able to make a choice that is very tough to make, regardless, because who has the time to do all these workouts and do physical fitness. But if you're making that, that's your discipline. And discipline will give you a very strong mindset in business. So, it's great. It's like a win. Win. It's kind of like that. There's a great, great YouTube video about, you know, if the only thing I do today is like, make my bed, then you know, that's a win, right? By the way, that is absolutely true. If that's all you can muster up in a day. Hey, that's something. And it's a win. It's a win. And it's important to celebrate all the wins. You know, it's so it's funny. I was thinking about one of the things I like about physical fitness. One of the things that I dislike the most, but is the best for me about physical fitness is especially with weightlifting is it, if I do it correctly, everything, every time I do a particular set of whatever muscle I'm exercising, it's going to be the hardest thing I've ever done at that moment. To that moment, that's pretty much how it works. And so, you know, and that stinks every time it stinks to do to do pushups until you basically can't do another one. Nobody, it's not fun. It doesn't feel good yet. It does build resiliency, right? And all of a sudden, like you were saying, you know, all the sudden you're running an iron man and you're like, my bed, I bet I have, you know, can do anything in my business now. If I can transform my body like that, I can transform anything. So it's really, really inspiring. Okay, let's talk about, let's talk about 2025, because it is the end of the year. This will come out before the, before the new year. And I would love for our audience to just start to think about how to have a really great 2025. We know it's a tough time right now. It's just, you know, things are goofy. Customer trust is down a bit. Of course, rates are not exactly where they were and they're probably never going to be. Listings aren't quite as prevalent as they were. People are locked into these 3% mortgages and aren't probably going anywhere for a while. And so there's just a lot of it's the doldrum and it's the holidays where the holidays are incredibly stressful. I know they're fun and exciting too, but we don't talk about how hard the holidays are enough and they are. So I want us to, to maybe this could be some some really, you know, hey, if you're not, if you're having to deal with family right now, because it's the holidays and you're like, uh, which by the way, totally normal. This might be a good fun little exercise to get out of that and think about what we can do proactively. So we can have a great 2025. So let's talk about it. What, you know, as a coach, what are some of the trends that you're seeing right now with your clients? Such a great question. I think you're going to see. So, you know, if I was to measure up, okay, I always laugh about this. I remember I'll never forget it. I look at the sequence of how everything's. I think COVID was the best thing that happens in the real estate industry. I really do, not the best for the economy, but for our industry, I think it was really good. I was looking at, you know, everybody in 2019 right before COVID hit. I remember I was sitting, I was in Egypt. I take a big trip every Christmas and New Year's. I'm on a camel. I'm in Egypt. I literally have like, I was celebrating New Year's on on there. It was 2020 New Year's Day and I took a picture on a camel in front of the pyramids and I was like, hashtag, thanks so much 2019. Let's cross 2020. Little did I know like 30 days later. I was like, what? I was like talking about terror. We all hibernated for a few years after that. Yeah, I was sitting there going like as I coached to REALTORS, I was like, you've got to be kidding. Like this is not, they're shutting all markets down like with a pandemic across the world. What a terrible job to have. And I was like, this is going to be hard. And so, you know, when I ended up happening, though, I said, I thought, wow, like, had I known that, you know, we thought 2020, you know, COVID was going to be the hard years. How did I know? So 2023 was a recovery, but 2024 was harder than everything. So 2024 was probably, I would say now that the year's almost over, I can actually say, you know what? We kept our clients in a tunnel. We didn't want them to really see anything outside of that tunnel. We're like, let's just stay focused on our targets and like, let's not, let's not even know what other agents are doing. So we just fed them fed them fed them positive positive positive positive. Kept them in a tunnel and we saw production escalate like you've never seen before. So one of the things that we really worked on, which I think is very impressive, is, you know, keeping them in that tunnel. But then I think the biggest trend that we're seeing because of all these changes is you said it earlier, you said consumers trust is down. So you have to remember trust is built by relationships. You know, and so we're seeing a massive and we've been preaching this for good six months. Our studies and surveys and everything that we're seeing shows that the people that we're succeeding and we had 98% of our clients outperform this year than any of their previous years. So we're very proud of that. But what we did is we funneled into their heads relationships. If you have a transactional based business versus a relationship based business, you are, you are definitely not going to succeed. You need to move away from being transactional based and move into being relationship based, which is a K a almost old school real estate and stop hiding behind technology. Use it, but don't hide behind it. Don't hide behind AI to do all your heavy lifting. You've got to remember that there's human beings on the other side and you need to connect with them. And if you, and that is a very, very, very challenging thing for a lot of people to understand. So you've got to build those relationship based business and any of our clients who are focused on relationships and how they're building them. Are you appreciating them? What are you doing over the holiday season to build relationships? How often are you picking up a phone and talking to people? You need to remember is that when trust is low, relationships need to be even higher. You need to build the trust. And that's got to happen or your business will take a hit. Well, let's talk about the benefits of building a building strong relationships because of course, people talk about how to do that. I do want to talk about that, but I want to make the case because I think people know that expression, not being transactional, being relational, deepening relationships. But let's talk about the actual benefits of why that's a good idea. And I don't mean to sound flippant or I really think it's important that we really drill about like, why is that important? Not just because it feels good and it's cool and people like it. But what, you know, let's talk about why I believe in if that you can demonstrate care to somebody that you care about them as a human and not just, you know, of course, the business side of it, your business relationship with them, but also whatever other parts of their life they're willing to share with you. And if you're willing to deepen those relationships, what you'll find is that those people feel a connection, that connection is almost like a, like a true bond. And it sort of comes back to you in all sorts of other ways. But tell me, tell me how you'd sort of think about relationships. Yeah. So, so that's a great question. So there's two things that you have to look at as a business owner. If you're building, so I coach two of the top performers in the world, okay? And the first number one, and they're right underneath each other. So the number one performer is very transactional based. The number two performer is very relationship based. Really? Interesting. Oh, yeah, very interesting. And they're neck and neck, but here's the biggest difference from a CEO perspective. And then I'll cover from a consumer perspective from a CEO perspective, the relationship based consumer, even though they're not selling quite as much that CEO, they're not selling as much as the transactional based individual team. What happens is that their net profit is higher. So if you're building relationships, you get business easier. You don't have to buy it. You don't have to pay for it. It comes easier. So your net profit is going to be stronger. Okay? Right. Because you're not, you're not, yeah, you're not having to pay for leads as much. You're not, the transactional person is feeding leads, is getting leads through. You have to buy, you have to buy your clients. Yeah. Because you're not spending enough time building relationships with your existing database. So therefore, you're seeing a gap, a very significant gap. And that's what's actually coming down the pipeline is that it's a very big gap between the two. So that's one thing that we see aggressively. And I always talk about that. And I'm like, so if you're a business owner and you're thinking of building a team or building a bigger team, or if you really are just a person who's like, how do I net more money, build a business more relationship based and you won't have to spend as much buying internet leads. I love internet leads like anybody else, but you're, you're, they're being sold seven times before they actually land with a REALTOR that can sell them. So you're, you know, the, it's a multi-billion-dollar business that's built on you not building relationships. So, so that's kind of where that comes from. On the flip side, what you have to remember about building relationship-based business is that I think we assume in real estate that every single person is, and I'll tell you a story about this, that'll back this point up clearly for every, every listener is that what you see in real estate is that everybody thinks that buying a house and selling a house is fictitiously like the movies. Like there's a happy reason or it's a happy story. In, in the economy, whether you're in Canada or the United States, the economy is so expensive and the cost of living is so expensive. But think of this, one in three people get divorced. You know, you have over 35% of people sell their houses because they have a critical illness. You know, they're, that is a big one. An aging demographic that has nowhere to go, but they own their houses and they're, they're losing minds share and all of the above and their kids are forcing themselves. So that's not a happy experience. The unemployment, there's over two million people unemployed that can't afford to pay for their house. So there is, there is so many factors that are not pleasant of why people buy and sell houses. So here's the story. If you don't pick up a phone, if you don't call them, you don't have a relationship with them and you don't care or you're oblivious and you're living in a dream world and you have one message that hits everybody that like and you send a massive email out and you're expecting your database is it's not going to work because you're, they're seeing your happy life on social media. Social media is a highlight reel of happiness. So if you're going through a critical illness and let's say you, you've been diagnosed and you're, you're not going to live and you need to make arrangements and then you come to my social media and everything is peaches and and I'm not calling you but everything looks great in my world. It's easier to go to a stranger than to try to be like, wow, Mary Ann's got this great life. Look at it out perfect. Everything is she doesn't pick up a phone call. It just feels unnatural to call you and drop a bomb that I'm dying like and I need to stay planned. That's not a natural thing to do or if you sold the house two years ago to a really happy couple with kids and then something happened. Let's say there's an affair or something, you know, or maybe poor spending or something happened that they're getting a nasty divorce. They're not going to pick up a phone and call you. You were the REALTOR that knew them though and they were happy and you didn't call them for two years. They're not even going to, like they're not going to. It's easier again to go somewhere else and not embarrassed. So I always relate back to my my 300 pound story. So I was when I was 300 pounds, that's a physical change. You can see that I was 300 pounds. If you couldn't see it then, then I would, you know, then I would question your eyesight and so at the end of the day, I was all over social media. You could see that I was 300 pounds. I wasn't always 300 pounds, so you could tell. And then all of a sudden, so I have these two personal trainers that are amazing on my social media account and they knew me and they never ever ever said a word. You'd see that I was 300 pounds. That is not healthy for me. And so then all of a sudden, you know, I hired the trainers. I lose the weight and I become an RMA World Championship athlete and they reached out to me both independently and they sent me very scathing messages. They were like your terrible person, your supposed to support small business owners and your terrible and this is against everything that you believe in your phony. And so I said both of them. I said respectfully. Can I just ask you two questions before we continue this banter? And they said, yeah, I said first question. I said, did you see that I was 300 pounds? Like, did you actually physically ever see that and both of them answered, yes, I said, great. Second question. Did you ever reach out to see if I needed help? Did you ever want to reach out to me? And they're like, no, fair point then. Here's the thing. I'm like, I was embarrassed. I was humiliated. I was going through something that, you know, why should I? If it's your job to build your business, your career could have been made by literally coming to me and doing that. But you chose not to. And I was embarrassed. And now you're giving me, you know, help. And basically saying that. And I'm like, the relationships means when you see somebody who may need your help, then reach out to them and they didn't. And the same thing applies to people who own houses. If you know the economy is tough for a majority of people, and you know that not every situation is happy, don't assume that people are okay. Check in with them and just say, hey, I'm just checking in to see, is everything good? Do you have any questions? Can I help with anything? You're not the bar cell, but are you okay, housing-wise? And can I help you with anything? Yeah, I mean, social media is great for knowing when the people in your life go on vacation or when they have great dinners or their kids have recitals. And that's all, that's all legitimate fine and good. And you should celebrate that stuff. Yeah, you should celebrate that stuff with your clients. And you should also realize nobody's posting their fights, nobody's with their significant other, nobody's posting the financial troubles they're having or, you know, the fact that that maybe they're going through a depression or they're getting divorced. And so I was almost thinking as you were talking just with my marketing hat and maybe this isn't a good idea. But, you know, 56% and I think right now it's unfortunate statistic, but I believe 56% of marriages currently in the US get divorced. People married get divorced. It's a crazy high number. Yeah, it's huge. And if it was me and I was thinking about how I could differentiate myself on social media, and I know REALTORS like to do fun things like show themselves at the gym and that's all great. You know, I appreciate that. I think that's super cool. It does let me know that you're disciplined and you care about, you know, whatever. There's lots of cool things you can do with that. And I think it would be cool too to say, you know, most people who are married more than half are going to get divorced and we never talk about it. And I bet there's people on this feed watching this right now that are going through something. And I, you know, and maybe you've even been there before. I, you know, I've been through that. And so I would want to say, hey, if you're feeling like this, like, you know, like, let's let's talk about it or or I know people that you can talk to about this or I have a great divorce attorney. Should you need that? And again, it's not about pitching and trying to get business, but just reaching out in that way. And of course, you'd want to do that personally too. But I love this idea of, you know, sort of somebody talking about the hard parts of life on social media. Isn't it? Like we talked about that and I dropped it on on a previous interview. I said, I said, I think that to me, like social media is great. There's so many advantages, but the biggest disadvantages of fact that I said, there should be one day a week or like the first Monday of every month. Yeah, just the first. Just talk about our problem. Yeah, just like just it's called like B real Monday. It's the first Monday of every month where you're not allowed having filters. So nobody can use a filter. Not one appearance filter in existence. You cannot be us. And if you post anything, it needs to be a hundred percent real. Like you cannot post that, you know, everything's great. And here's my filter. I want to see the real stuff on the first Monday of every month. I want to see, guess what? Woke up kids puked everywhere or, you know, this happened or just got my bill can't pay it. This is great. What am I going to do? No idea. I'm going to Starbucks. Like I want to see real shit, right? I want to see the like show me what show me what really is happening in your world. Don't put on the filter. Wake up and be like, didn't want to get out of bed today. Force myself out. You know, or broke this or you know, just lost the client. Like we need to actually see that it's like, guess what? Terrible day. Like, you know what? No, we don't need that negative feed every day. The world would be terrible. But I think at the end of the day, I think the reality is that there's so many stuff in there. It's like, you know what? There's some great stuff. Hey, got in my car to an appointment. And guess what? You know what? Spilled my coffee all over myself. Now look at me. And I'm not using a filter. This is great. Like I just think that there's so many opportunities for us to also because what you have to remember is if you always post the highlight reel and you're always posting the great stuff, then the number one thing that goes wrong is is that the consumers, your clients are googling you. They're searching you. They're looking at you. They're doing all that stuff. So what ends up happening is that they don't feel comfortable. Like, you know, I lost my mom when I was young. And one of the things is this, I was like, I think about that. And I'm like, like, if I never post, you know, the tough stuff, then everybody's going to assume my life is perfect. So it's kind of like this, this catch 22. It's like nobody has a perfect life. And we're all going through stuff. And it's like, I always find when I speak to audiences, when I say to the room, I lead in with showing them my life story. And I'm like, you think everything's perfect. But I need you to see this. And the whole room just stops and goes, wow. And I'm like, yeah, I said, you know, you think everybody's had a perfect life. But because we don't share the tough stuff, we're all going through something. And it's really important to know that. And we're all of us have one significant problem in our life. That's very second. Every single person has something going on that they're probably not talking about other than their closest friends or family and maybe not even them. And so, you know, what I would love to see videos from REALTORS, you know, and again, it's not about wanting to see somebody doing doing something that's that hurts or that's painful. But I would love to see somebody coming back from a listing presentation crying going, I did not get I did not get that listing. It's really bumming me out. I'm having a horrible day. I'm going to I'm going to I'm going to if I threw it, but boy, this is a tough one for me. And I feel really sad about it. And that I would love that level of honesty. And I think I believe that we, we only connect to imperfection. I don't think we connect to perfection because we just don't under like it's interesting to look at, I guess, but we don't connect with it's not like we understand, you know, that that's a that's a real thing because we know our lives aren't that. So I think we connect more to the to the challenges that people are experiencing. And that's one thing that I would encourage our listeners to consider, again, you know, set boundaries and you don't have to share everything with everybody. But this idea of you might just, okay, you know, if you come back, if somebody were to post that, oh my god, I lost this listing. It was a big deal. And I really wanted it. And now I'm worried about blah, blah, you know, paying the bills or whatever. Um, and maybe you wouldn't say all that, but you would, you could talk about the disappointment you're feeling. Everybody can relate to that because every single REALTOR has lost a listing from a listing presentation. And it's bummed them out. And that's the kind of way I think that you can connect. And again, we're just talking social media. But let's talk about sort of, yeah, because you talked about and look, you know, we are, you were seeing, we are seeing trends, the newer generations are not, well, they are on social media, but they're not really, they're more absorbing content on places like TikTok and Instagram. They're not really communicating with each other as much. And so I, what I'm interested in is, as you were saying, going back to the basics and going to one-to-one, you know, picking up the phone, dropping something by, you know, in person, you know, just having coffee with somebody, those kind of things, you know, first of all, how important do you think those kind of connections are for like 2025? I think that the connections for 2025 are critical. We're suggesting that you pick up a phone and you call your database four times a year. So every quarter circle through and make sure you reach everybody every quarter, even including for that generation that is very social, because I hear it all the time from that generation that's like, okay, my generation, that's what I hear, my generation only likes text messages. Okay, first of all, I'm going to call BS on that. I'm talking about text messages, okay? They don't. They like to communicate with friends and other people via text messages, but if you really want to know the truth, who's going to tell you that they just thought, you know, diagnose with cancer on a text? Find me one person who's done that. Find me one person that's Texas somebody and the response has been, yeah, just, you know, a fan out partner is like, this is that and we're getting divorced. Like, it doesn't, or lost my job, you know, that, like, it doesn't happen. Basic, very low level communication happens on text. So I would say for that generation, whether it's a social media generation, you can send a DM and a DM is just as good to say, hey, I'm checking in on you. I want to just make sure everything's okay. Do you have any questions? That can work if your social profile is very good and you're very communicative. That'll work. But I would say, you know, pop buys and other things, those are equally as good, but take it into 2025 and start doing, okay, in a time where the economy's tough, go to a movie theater, treat your very low movie, right, and invite them out to the movie and just take them out for the night and be like, hey, you guys matter to me. And you know, why don't you know, top financial things are a little tough right now. So we're having a movie night and like do something like that. And that's just as good, but really diving in and caring about them and doing four calls a year will make your referral business go through the roof and you'll see that increase tremendously. I just think that, you know, as you head into 2025, you know, having a very specific plan to say, you know, if I went through a whole year and a great thing to look at is right now, what have I done in to celebrate the holiday season? You know, with all the people that know me, have I done a massive email out to just do a recording video and say, hey, it's Mary Ann. I just want to say happy holidays, you know, what, whether you celebrate the holiday season or don't celebrate the holiday season, it is a time to reflect back, look at the year, look around you, be grateful for everything you do have. And I want to sincerely wish you the best. And you know, I'm going to reach out to everybody in the new year, one on one and see if you guys need anything and always feel free to come to me. If you're not even doing that, you don't have a relationship. So start really looking and saying, how often am I communicating without asking for anything back with nothing back, you know, am I just checking it? Am I seeing if you have questions? And you know, if the rates are dropping, which they should, if the rates are dropping, have we done a circle check into people? Have we seen if everybody's okay? Have we helped out in any capacity? And so you really have to, you know, lean into that and then equally also build those relationships significantly in 2025. So be conscious of what you're doing. I would say 55 touches a year to your database. That is my number. If you're hearing anything less than that, you have to remember that there's like 10,000 on a regular day. This is not Christmas, not competing with Santa, but on a regular day, there's 10,000 ads that are running across person space in their span of a day with digital communication. So don't mix yourself up with those, stand out and don't be afraid to do 50 or more touches a year, you know, with your database, whether it's emails or texts or events or whatever the case is, lean into how can I communicate with these guys three to four times a month with great content and great knowledge so that we would professional, but we're answering questions that they might have. And that's a big difference because you're competing with 10,000 advertisements a day. So if you're only talking to them two, three times a year or even less than that and you're not sending anything out, then they're not even, you're not top of mind so you're not going to get the business. So let's get to 55. So let's just get really specific because I'd love to give this formula to so we know they're going to get four calls a year. So there's the first four. We know that you're if you have a newsletter or monthly whatever you're emailing out. Okay, so there's another 12 now we're 18. We'll say two client events a year and probably maybe you could do so now we're at 20. And now we could, okay, and oh, we could do on social media. Whenever they post something, hey, just got back from cancun. Amazing, that looked awesome. Can't you know, let's chat about it. I'd love to hear how you're okay. So maybe that's you do that maybe 10 times a year now we're up to 30. How can we burst that gap? What other things would you recommend to get a sum? I love that. Well, like I'll give you an example. So if you're looking at December or so let's say December January, you got to think a little bit outside of the box, but think of information that's cool, kind of fun, kind of interesting. So if you're area that you live in, you know, why don't you do a post at the end of December 31st, look up what was the highest selling priced house in your entire city? Into your entire area? What was it? That's fun. Call the agent and just and say the agent, hey, listen, by the way, I don't if you know, but you were registering as a highest selling listing at all in this area. I would love the opportunity. Would you mind if I send an email? I want to highlight that because that is incredible. First of all, every agent's going to say yes, nobody's going to be like, uh, no, don't promote me as that person. Now listen, I'm not worried about people using that person because they're not going to what I want to do is I want to get my database or I want to get excited. So I'm going to, you know, go on social media. First thing I'm going to do if I'm a social media person in my database is there. I'm going to put a post up and I'm going to say, guess the price of the highest selling listing in our city. That's the first thing, get the engagement up, all the above. But on the second note, I'm going to actually send an email and say, hey, everybody, you know, to my whole database, if I'm an email database, for someone to go, hey, everybody, just want to here it is. Here is the 2024 highest selling MLS house in our city. Take a guess at this, click on the link to see it, the video of it and at the end of the video, I will tell you what the price is. And so do it and be like, hey, I just want to let you know and click the video. That is a cool touch. It's just interesting. It shows that you know, what's going on and it kind of is an engagement. So it's good. So that's one thing. Then the other thing you want, and that's a January thing that we do. But we also do in January, every January, we instruct our clients, we say, do a worksheet. And a worksheet is really cool to send out to say, look, how many people are sitting in houses that have great equity or maybe they want to do something. Are you sending out a worksheet to say, hey, if you're thinking of, you know, doing something in your house, here's a great worksheet to work on. Fill up the blanks and this is what your equity is going to be. And then here's 15 different things that you can do with your equity or whatever, give a worksheet. You can write it through chat, you be to your code and just basically launch it through those systems and say, create me a worksheet that I can do. But let's send it out and be like, this is really cool. We don't do enough of that. So that's another thing that you can actually be doing. And so it's about giving data. That's really cool. And then February, you have one month of data. Why don't you jump in on February and do something really cool and be like, hey, 30 days, 31 days into the year. Here's my forecast on what we're seeing early in the game. There's great content. So it's all about like really hyper local. So being very hyper local with your information, but also being very creative and saying, don't give them recipes because like if you send me a recipe and you're my dentist, I'm going to be like, what the f is this? Like that is the weirdest thing I've ever seen in this industry. I'm like, why are you? We can all find our own recipes. It's like, it's not hard to find a recipe. I'm like, I got an email the other day from somebody and they're in a totally different industry. And they're just like, here's our favorite Christmas drinks. And I was like, I was like, it's a little weird. I'm like, thank you for sending that. But like, that's just a weird email. I'm like, that reinforced nothing. And everything that you're doing should be about, are you giving hyper local? Nobody cares about anything else. That is a very big trend. Hyper local. They want to know what's going on. If you have a farm area, are you going door to door in the month of January? Did you do a year synopsis 23 versus 24 for that for your neighborhood that you farm? Go door to door, introduce yourself. Hey, I'm Mary Ann. This is my farm area. I have a great report that I've launched. It's digital. So I'm going door to door. It gives you a really good snapshot on 23 versus 24. Here's what it looks like. This report is gangbuster. It's amazing. I'd like to send you a copy. What's the best email address? Love it. And I want to also go a little bit beyond so hyper local. I just had a thought and I'm curious to your opinion on it. I don't think it even stops with your physical local community. I think it goes all the way to the individual because if you know, in your C.R.M. if you know when their birthdays are, if you know when they're what their ages of their children are, if you know the birthdays of their children, if you know they're wedding anniversary date, if you know that, you know, whatever, those kind of life event stuff that happened every single year, you now have probably another five or six phone calls you get to make for no other reason than to be like, hey, I know it's your child's birthday today. Hope, hope he's having a great one. Just, just was thinking about him and you know, have, I hope you guys have a fun, a fun time. Like if that's all you did, here's what I did. This is funny. I did this years ago. Just it occurred to me and it's nothing to do with business, but I realized my friends, you know, my memory is so terrible. I've, I've, I've, I've been to a lot of weddings. I have certainly, I've been in weddings, of course. And I never remember like when some was anniversary. So finally I sent a thing to my friends, I go, it's just right back, tell me your anniversary date. And then I have a thing that it just pops up every time goes, hey, so in so is anniversary. And all I do is send a text because you know, they don't probably need me to call, but I just go, hey, tell you and your wife, hope you're having a great, you know, great anniversary. And they're like, you're the only person that does that. And it doesn't make me special. It was just an email I sent and I put it in my calendar and it's not that hard. And now I get to make them feel appreciated on a really special day, you know, for them, assuming they're, you know, who they're having a good anniversary. But, but the idea is that like those are things that people don't do that have nothing to do with real estate, but will do everything for that relationship. It you nailed it. And it's like it's the, it's the little details and there's a great book. It's an old book, but it's a great one. And it's a swim with the sharks or get, get eaten alive, I think is called. So swim the shark that in the life. And I remember meeting the author of the book. And I remember just watching him present and like just a genius. He's such a genius, but his whole concept of that book, although it's very old, but it's a great book, is the principle applies more now than it's ever applied where it's like, look, swim with the sharks is all about what it means is, and he always taught this and his name's Harvey McKay. Oh, yeah. He taught this like really brilliant, brilliant networker. And he always has said, the best people in sales are the ones who know their audience before their audience knows that they know them. And it's like, and if you can do the research, so if you have a, and it's so easy now, you're going on a listing appointment, for example, you're heading into that listing appointment or whatever the case is, and you're looking, you can do all this research, you can know everything about them. If you have a client, you know, it is easier. I have a team that I coach that literally has an individual on the team. They're only job. They're a VA. They're only job is all team members flag their social media. This VA is designed that if you have them flag. So if you're my client, I have you flagged, you're on my social media, any notification, I get notified, which is a lot during the day, but you decipher through it at the end of the day. And I look and I see and I'm like, oh, okay, and I'm like, perfect boom, boom, boom, boom. And I go, oh, look, he's got, he's got an opportunity here. But well, and I'm like, oh, all of a sudden, you show me that you took a vacation, you just had Putin and Montreal. Well, that VA, I will send that and that VA will be like perfect. And the VA will send it on my behalf and they'll send you something I'll be like, hey, you know what, just saw that you had Putin and Montreal, my hometown. How did you love it? Was it amazing? Awesome. And you know, you know, whatever the case is or all of a fact about Putin, did you know Putin, it came to do that? Like we'll just have fun with it. And if there's a special moment that you have this VA is designed for to pick up and the agent sends it and says, hey, listen, do you need a pair of us just, you know, just ended up, you know, taking this fabulous trip to Bali and post all these pictures, that VA will take a pick. One of your best shots, take it, print it, put it in something really cool, like, you know, what coast you're a mug or whatever the case is. And we'll just send it as a gift. We'll be like, hey, you know what, we saw your pictures to Bali or wherever. And just want to let you know, this was our favorite. So we thought we'd just put it on a mug for you so you could look at it yourself every day. Dude, that goes like here. Oh, that's next level. Yeah, it's it's absolutely right. And I have been to Bali, believe it or not. It is an amazing place for everyone who who I went, yeah, I went in the mid 2000s and I tell it's just a long trip from the US, but it is absolutely worth it. It even works from Canada. I wanted to also share a way that another way that people don't utilize as much. And if you're listening to our show, you've probably heard me say this before we always getting new listeners. I'll share it again. And it's always good repetition. I think it's the mother of skill linked in is great for knowing for for knowing things about somebody's professional development. I mean, it will it will tell you when they get a promotion at work. It will tell you when they switch jobs, it will tell you their work anniversary. By the way, they don't even know their work anniversary. I know I don't. It's funny every year on whenever I don't even still don't know I get them on linked in. I never read them because they're just little text messages for or they're sorry, instant messages or sorry, direct messages on linked in. And I don't know these people. If I was the person wanting to congratulate me, my phone number is not hard to find. I would pick up the phone and be like, Hey, I bet you didn't know it was your work anniversary. Anyway, congratulations on 14 years at Plubba. But you know, that's or it could be a text message too. But I'm saying these are like let technology help you with this because it can do a lot of that heavy lifting for you. 100%. 100%. So no, I'm gonna full agree with you on that one. Absolutely. Yep. So with your top teams, so you were saying, you know, one of the top producers is relational and the other one is more transactional. And they're just totally different business models and they have different profit margins. And certainly different levels of stress probably. I would assume the transactional person is terrified about that lead source drying up. Yep. 100%. They're terrified about the lead source drying up. And that's the race that you get to the bottom, right? So like that's exactly what happens is that you have this, you know, it's not that. And again, more units are sold by that transactional based team. And it's not it's not a bad thing. It's just sometimes you can build a business. You may have to take a pause in your business and just go, Okay, you know what, this makes a lot of sense. Or if you're seeing your profit and loss statement is out of control, then you need to do something about that where you're like, what am I missing? Because usually if you're high transactional, you still like the good news is, is that team is going to be very conscious in 2025 flipping the noodle because they have the transactions. So even if you've built, okay, I don't want the listeners to feel like, Oh boy, like I'm super transactional. Transactual doesn't mean you don't care. It does not mean that transactional means that you still care about the business. You still care about the clients, but you're so focused on turning more deals that you've missed the building a really good foundation with your current existing transactions and you're kind of just going next, next, next and you're just like a machine and you're still loving your clients. You're still excellent what you do, but you've missed the relationship. So you're actually you're not getting, you're missing a portion of the business and that's affecting your bottom line. So I would say the good news about anybody who's listening, who's saying that's me, which is a lot of agents is go back because it's not too late. I've worked with people that have had 20 years of transactional businesses and they come in and we're able to blow that all up and we're able to just really just do it and people don't care. See what happens when you run a transactional business? This everybody seems to think, you know, they get worried. They're like, well, you know, what nobody's referring me business or what's happening. I said, what you're seeing is, is that when I go to a dentist, I go to a dentist and he works on my teeth. I love my dentist. He's amazing. And so he does my teeth. He works on them, but I don't hear from him. He doesn't call me up and he's like, Hey, I was going like he doesn't check in. I was your teeth. I was like, when I need him, I'll call him. If he needs me for something, which he has for coaching, he calls me. It's 50-50, if I don't need him, I don't hear from him. He doesn't hear from me. There's only a call when I need. That's what transactional is. If they need you, so they're not thinking of you as a relationship REALTOR, which is okay. It's not a bad thing. They don't think you're terrible. It's just you did your job and now you don't talk to them. You send them an email here. You're still communicating. That's natural. So they're not looking at you like a beast or anything. They're looking at you going, Well, you know what? Maryanne didn't reach out to us. She doesn't really need us. So it's all good. There's no relationship there. So you have a chance always if you're offering a transactional business, you actually have a beautiful chance to change that rip off the band-aid and just be honest and call people up in the new year and say, Hey, guess what? Maryanne, I just let you know. I've operated a business where I've been so busy that I haven't actually paid attention to forming great relationships post sale and we're changing that in 2025. And we are going to do a much better job. So I'm going to send you a quick survey and the survey is going to, you know, ask you everything that I need to know. It's going to ask about birthdays. And the first use your favorite this, your favorite that an art company and team. We're going to up it and we're going to try to be more like Disney. It's not going to happen overnight, but we're going to do a really good job this year of trying to really pour into you guys because what we realized is that, you know what? We want to do better and we know we can. So we're going to start now and your database will be like send me the information like they don't care. They're going to love it. They're okay with it. If your dentist did that to you today, all we do is call you when we need to, you know, clean your teeth or do something and what we've decided is we could be giving you better information about taking care of your teeth. We could be doing a feature product every month with you. We could be doing a much better job of being proactive with you and we're not. So you know what? We're going to do that. Like I would love it if my dentist sent me something like, you know, I was on Amazon Prime Day and I was trying to get a water pick for my teeth and I was like, I gave up because I was like, there's like 20 of them. I don't know. What's this one mean? What's that? What's going to get? I would love it if my dentist sent me out an email newsletter one or, you know, saying, hey, you know, 2025, you know, what or Amazon Prime Day? If you were looking for the best things to get on prime, that would make my job as your dentist easier. Here's my top three choices. That would be a great email to get. Awesome email and I'll tell you, I'll give you an example of my dentist who did go, who did go the extra mile just recently. So no, no, no, this is, this is amazing. So I've been with him for like 15 years. He does something very interesting that most dentists don't. He does the entire cleaning himself. And I asked him, there is no, there's no tech. It is just him and his wife is also, they're both dentists and they both do this. And I asked him one, so I said, why do you do that? He goes, it's my job. Number one, he goes number two, I make more money because I don't have to pay another person. And my clients really appreciate it because no one's ever done that for them before. Anyway, but that's not even the cool thing he did because he's been doing that forever. I had to, I have a tooth that's cracked and I have to eventually get it extracted and then replaced. And anyway, so I haven't, I haven't done that yet. But the challenge was, so I looked for a place here locally in. Yeah, I was painter. You know, no, no, no, no, no, pain. Thankfully, no, no, no, no, the same thing happened. I had to get it out. No, no, if I was in pain, I'd get it done immediately. I this can kind of go wait for a while. But anyway, at the time I was single and, and he, he, so I went and got a quote from a place here and it was like insane. And he goes, don't, don't pay that. He goes, I, one of my friends who I went to, you know, dental school with, he's about an hour away. He'll do it for half the price. He's a buddy of mine. And I go, oh, man, that's amazing. Thanks so much. So I saw him. So I didn't end up doing it yet. But I said to him the last time I saw him, I said, you know, one of the challenges because I was single time. I said, is that I'd, because I have to put me under, I have to have somebody drive me home and it's an hour away. I go, I guess I could Uber, but that's really expensive or I could call my parents to come up, you know, from three hours away. And I go, yeah, I just have to figure out how to do that. He goes, I'll drive you. And I go, no, no, no, he goes, no, it'd be fun for me. He goes, I would love to drive you down there. He goes, I'll go shopping while they're putting you under because I don't care. And I was like, that's the most amazing thing a dentist has ever said to me. I will drive you to one hour each way and you know, doesn't, doesn't earn him one dollar. I'm going to him. I'm going to hit, I'm going to him forever anyway. I, I, I, but again, that's a great, that's a person who cares about relationships. Yep. And, and can you imagine how many people locally, I have told that story to here. Right. With his name. And I don't, I don't know how many people have, you know, joined him or whatever, but I tell that story to everybody and everybody's like, oh my god, that's, that's incredible. Race story. So those are the things I guess you want to create with, with your clients is yes, of course, we can't, you know, drive everyone two hours, but we could, we could call them on their birthday. We could, we could call them on their birthday. So I, I'm like 100% fine doing that one. All right. I love it. We, we have spent almost a full hour here with her. And we're going to do this again, because this is, so again, we're going to focus on relationships in 2025, which mean how many hours a day should somebody be focusing on relationships? So if I was an agent, if you were an agent right now and you were thinking about 20 and you did no business to do, what, how many hours a day would you be focusing on relationships on a given weekday? That's a great question. I think you have to remember is this, okay? You have to look at, I have a client who wanted to make $100,000 a month. And so he wants $1.2 million by the end of the year. And so we did really good this year. And he hit his targets. But what he did is we worked his numbers out and we figured out that he wanted to work less than 40 hours a week. And he only wanted to work, he wanted four weeks off a year, all the above and he wanted $100,000 a month. So what we figured out is his hourly wage was about $680 for hour. So what he committed to is he set the boundary. And so what we said is that the only way to earn that is he had to be spending his highest priority of time, which is lead generation and priorities on booking appointments and getting the deals. That had to be where he spends his time. So the truth is is that you have to really look at what is your hourly wage. He spends about, I would say, spend 80% if you're behind your goals and you don't have a lot of clients, 80% of your 40 hour work week should be spent on the highest producing quality things, not marketing. It would be how do I find clients' relationship based calling, visiting, you know, asking for the business. If you're on track with your goals and you're kind of like, you've got a lot of clients leading into the new year. So around 10 clients, 11 clients ready to go for the new year, then you're really going to be spending. I would say about, I say 20 hours a week, just maintenance thing and finding new ones and replenishing. And then if you're way ahead and you're like, I got 20 clients, I'm like slammed with it, then you're in maintenance at about seven hours. So it's really depending on where your business is. If you're lacking the clients, 80% of your 40 hour work week needs to go into lead generation, which is relationship based right now and just dive in. So you need to be having a significant amount of time spent on the highest priority of returns. Love it, love it. Marianne, thank you so much. On behalf of our audience, thank you.
