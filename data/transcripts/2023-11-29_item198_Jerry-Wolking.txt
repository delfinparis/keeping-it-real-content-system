[00:02:25] We're going to be cranking out just as many episodes this month
[00:02:28] as per usual.
[00:02:29] And we have some really exciting things planned for 2024.
[00:02:32] So stay tuned for that.
[00:02:34] But let's get to the main event.
[00:02:36] My conversation with Jerry Wolking.
[00:02:51] Today on the show, my guest is Jerry Wolking from Keller,
[00:02:55] Williams, greater quad cities, which is actually Illinois
[00:03:00] and Iowa.
[00:03:01] So there's four cities for those of you not in the Midwest
[00:03:03] and not familiar with, I guess, Quad cities
[00:03:05] with self-explanatory.
[00:03:07] But it actually borders two states, Illinois and Iowa.
[00:03:11] But let me tell you more about Jerry.
[00:03:12] By the way, before I get into Jerry's bio,
[00:03:16] Jerry is Alex Wolking's father.
[00:03:18] Alex is somebody we featured recently on our show.
[00:03:22] We were so incredibly impressed with Alex.
[00:03:24] And if you haven't listened to an episode,
[00:03:26] I'd really encourage you to do that.
[00:03:28] And Alex has like, I learned everything for my dad.
[00:03:31] So we're like, we probably should bring his dad on too,
[00:03:32] who's also a very successful agent for 30 plus years.
[00:03:36] But let me go through more of Jerry's bio.
[00:03:39] Jerry's been in the business since April of 1993.
[00:03:43] That is 30 plus years.
[00:03:44] Congratulations.
[00:03:46] He started as a part-time agent.
[00:03:47] Like so many of us and became a full-time agent a year later
[00:03:50] in 1994 after selling his landscape company.
[00:03:54] He is licensed in Iowa and Illinois.
[00:03:56] And Jerry is one of these rare types of agents
[00:04:00] who is able to successfully boot residential and commercial.
[00:04:04] So we're going to talk a little bit about how he manages
[00:04:07] both of those lanes.
[00:04:08] He is also a graduate of the REALTORS Institute
[00:04:11] and a certified negotiation expert.
[00:04:13] In my opinion, the most one of the designations
[00:04:18] I think agents should explore because certainly
[00:04:21] is something you can tell your clients
[00:04:23] that you are a certified negotiation expert.
[00:04:25] I'm a huge fan of that.
[00:04:26] Also, Jerry has served on the Professional Standards Committee.
[00:04:29] The Grievance Committee and the Commercial Committee
[00:04:32] and now teaches classes to REALTORS on various topics
[00:04:35] at his local association.
[00:04:38] Jerry, oh, I'm sorry, find, you can learn more about Jerry
[00:04:41] at his website.
[00:04:42] We will have a link to this in the show notes
[00:04:44] and in the description, which is qcbizboxqcbiz.exe.com
[00:04:50] and goes over what Jerry is all about.
[00:04:52] Jerry, welcome to the show.
[00:04:54] Thank you, sir.
[00:04:55] Well, Jerry and I just had, we were just talking
[00:04:59] sort of backstage of, if that's the right expression
[00:05:02] and it was really a lot of fun because Jerry is,
[00:05:07] you're so much like your son and he is just such a wonderful
[00:05:11] young man in this Chicago market and we're so grateful
[00:05:15] to have him on the show and now we're so happy to have you.
[00:05:18] So you've been doing this.
[00:05:19] Congratulations on 30 years, by the way.
[00:05:21] Yes, sir.
[00:05:22] Yes, you've been a long haul.
[00:05:24] That's perfect.
[00:05:26] Well, you know, right now, actually, Jerry,
[00:05:29] let's talk about how you got in.
[00:05:30] So I know you were in landscaping, you had a business
[00:05:34] and why the switch from landscaping to, you know,
[00:05:38] I guess the way I think about it, landscaping is one
[00:05:43] of those industries that seems to never go out of fashion
[00:05:48] and real estate say people have to live somewhere.
[00:05:50] People need to maintain their properties, their lawns,
[00:05:53] et cetera.
[00:05:54] So why the switch from landscaping all those industries?
[00:05:57] 
[00:05:57] Well, thank you for asking.
[00:05:58] I've done many, many things, DJ.
[00:06:01] I've had a very, I tell people all the time,
[00:06:03] if I died tomorrow, I have lived the full life.
[00:06:05] I've been a drummer in a heavy metal band for a long time.
[00:06:09] I raised motorcycles in my professionally.
[00:06:11] I sold life insurance.
[00:06:14] I was a welder at John Deere.
[00:06:16] I've been an auto mechanic.
[00:06:17] I've been a contractor many, many different things
[00:06:19] and I found a love of landscape back in the late 80s,
[00:06:23] early 90s and still do a lot of it today.
[00:06:26] But, you know, the body only holds up for so long.
[00:06:30] They don't make a laptop that'll plant a 400 pound tree.
[00:06:33] So that takes its toll after a while.
[00:06:36] But I had always had an interest in real estate.
[00:06:39] And here in the Midwest, in landscape season,
[00:06:43] it's pretty short-lived.
[00:06:44] And when it gets November, December, and all of a sudden,
[00:06:46] there's no lawns to mow, there you're not planting flowers
[00:06:49] and the ground is frozen for doing any planting.
[00:06:52] So the winters would be scarce, very scarce.
[00:06:55] And I was actually working in a body shop
[00:06:58] and I was getting paid $100 a car
[00:07:01] to paint cars out in Geneseo, Illinois.
[00:07:04] No heat, had a little space heater.
[00:07:06] And this guy was flipping cars.
[00:07:08] He gave me a hundred bucks a car to paint them.
[00:07:10] I was miserable.
[00:07:11] And I was sitting in this little office
[00:07:14] and I happened to be reading a newspaper on my lunch break
[00:07:16] and it said, a career in real estate,
[00:07:19] reading in the newspaper.
[00:07:20] And I'm like, I've always had an interest in real estate
[00:07:23] to see what it's like.
[00:07:24] So I had to borrow the money, long story short.
[00:07:27] I was so broke I couldn't pay attention.
[00:07:29] I had to borrow the money to go to my real estate class started.
[00:07:33] And I did.
[00:07:34] And went through it, passed the class with flying colors,
[00:07:37] passed my test.
[00:07:38] And then next year, here I am, a real estate agent.
[00:07:40] And that was in April of 93.
[00:07:43] Still had my landscape company.
[00:07:45] And as you know, real estate being a commission business,
[00:07:48] I'd never worked in a commission world before.
[00:07:51] It was scarce to start with.
[00:07:54] Because it is far too easy.
[00:07:57] Here's my quote of the day.
[00:07:59] It is far too easy to get a real estate license.
[00:08:02] There are so many people in this industry who shouldn't be in it.
[00:08:05] And let me preface DJ by saying,
[00:08:07] I'm probably going to say something that
[00:08:09] it's been someone today because I love your show.
[00:08:12] The name of your show is very fitting.
[00:08:15] So we're going to get real here today.
[00:08:16] Let's get real.
[00:08:17] Yeah, there you go.
[00:08:18] So I started out like most other agents
[00:08:21] taking open houses from the big producers who didn't want
[00:08:25] to do them.
[00:08:26] And at the time I was working for one of the largest brokers
[00:08:29] in the Quad Cities.
[00:08:30] They were the largest broker in the Quad Cities at the time.
[00:08:32] And we had this thing called Florida Duty,
[00:08:35] where you could sit at this table in this little office
[00:08:38] for two hour shifts.
[00:08:39] Each agent got two hour shifts.
[00:08:42] And any phone calls that came into the office
[00:08:44] inquiring about listings went to the Florida Duty person.
[00:08:47] And that was your business to capitalize.
[00:08:49] So I was taking as many Florida duty sessions as I could get.
[00:08:52] Most of them in the evening hours, five to seven, five to six.
[00:08:55] Because I was out planting trees and mowing lawns
[00:08:57] during the day.
[00:08:59] And what had happened was I was getting busy enough
[00:09:04] after a Florida duty in open houses
[00:09:06] that I would literally change clothes three
[00:09:08] and four times a day.
[00:09:10] I would go out in mow two lawns, change clothes,
[00:09:12] go show a house, go out in plant two trees,
[00:09:15] change clothes, go out and show a house.
[00:09:16] That was going on and on for months.
[00:09:19] And the turning point for me was I had a showing
[00:09:23] at a condominium in East Moline.
[00:09:26] And I was planting trees all day.
[00:09:27] I was mud from head to toe.
[00:09:30] And I was late for my appointment, like 15 minutes late.
[00:09:33] And I did not have time to go home and change clothes.
[00:09:36] So I drove to the appointment with my rig,
[00:09:38] had my mowers and everything sticking out the back.
[00:09:41] I'm in my landscape gear.
[00:09:42] I'm mud from knees down to my boots, dried mud.
[00:09:45] And as I walk up to the shore and them 15 minutes late,
[00:09:49] and the gentleman is sitting on the front porch
[00:09:51] of this condo on the front stoop.
[00:09:54] And I said, hi, my name's Jerry Walking.
[00:09:56] I'm the REALTOR here to show you the property.
[00:09:58] And he dislooped at me.
[00:09:59] And he goes, are you a real estate agent?
[00:10:01] And I said, yes, sir.
[00:10:03] And I also landscaped company.
[00:10:05] And this was the turning point in my career.
[00:10:07] This day, this gentleman looked at me
[00:10:09] at a very stern look on his face.
[00:10:11] And he said, I'm not interested in a part-time agent.
[00:10:15] The next week, the next week, I sold the company.
[00:10:18] I sold the landscape company and went 100% in two real estate.
[00:10:23] That was a big jump.
[00:10:24] And I went five months, my first five months with no paycheck.
[00:10:27] And I'd been used to having steady income.
[00:10:30] I had employees, I had trucks.
[00:10:32] I had plenty of contracts to do.
[00:10:35] I sold my company to my dad, who was retired
[00:10:38] from the military, looking for something to do.
[00:10:40] He, by the way, today still runs that same company
[00:10:43] to this day off of a lot of the same clients
[00:10:45] that we had back in the early 90s.
[00:10:48] But it was that push of that gentleman telling to me,
[00:10:51] telling me I'm not interested in a part-time agent
[00:10:53] that made me go, I can't do this anymore.
[00:10:57] I can't continue to go changing clothes.
[00:10:59] Three or four times a day, this went on for months.
[00:11:02] It was wearing me out.
[00:11:04] And I wasn't succeeding at a high level
[00:11:06] at either position, though, because I'm part-time,
[00:11:09] landscape or part-time most-day agent.
[00:11:11] So it was probably the greatest slap of reality
[00:11:14] I could ever get for him to say that.
[00:11:16] And that's when it turned.
[00:11:17] And I started taking off from there.
[00:11:19] And I was lucky enough to have a broker by the name of Irene
[00:11:23] Romeo, who said to me, you've got great stuff, kid.
[00:11:26] You need to go to GRI now.
[00:11:29] That's where you need to get.
[00:11:31] So I did my first full-time year.
[00:11:33] I started GRI.
[00:11:34] I think you did a fall session, spring session, fall session.
[00:11:37] I did them consecutively, learned a lot.
[00:11:39] And it catapulted me forward on being able to get my business
[00:11:43] started and growing.
[00:11:44] So I've been surrounded by a lot of great people
[00:11:46] who helped me get started and saw something in me
[00:11:49] that was worth nurturing.
[00:11:51] So I'm very fortunate that way.
[00:11:54] And for any of our listeners who aren't familiar with GRI,
[00:11:57] do you mind sharing just a little bit about what that is for?
[00:11:59] Yeah, that's a graduate Rilters Institute.
[00:12:01] One of the things I noticed today,
[00:12:03] we are have written several real estate classes.
[00:12:07] My partner, Deborah and I, we've written classes.
[00:12:09] She does all the technical stuff, the PowerPoints and all that.
[00:12:12] And we presented these classes to Rilters.
[00:12:14] And now the board of Rilters has picked them up.
[00:12:16] But GRI is a segment of classes from everything,
[00:12:21] about marketing, about personal growth,
[00:12:24] about the Rilters State industry, about appraisal.
[00:12:26] It's a great place for residential agents to go
[00:12:29] and get a lot of education in a short period of time.
[00:12:32] Because that's like four and five consecutive days of classes.
[00:12:36] And one of the things that I have noticed is now,
[00:12:38] is brokerages, at least in our area,
[00:12:41] and please know everything I'm saying is based on our area,
[00:12:43] because that's what I know.
[00:12:45] They're fragmenting so much.
[00:12:47] It used to be in the early 90s.
[00:12:49] There were two 800 pound gorillas here in town.
[00:12:52] And they controlled everything.
[00:12:53] One of them controlled 52% of the market at one time.
[00:12:57] So every other house was listed by this brokerage.
[00:12:59] Well, as these other companies have come into play,
[00:13:03] Keller Williams, eXp, and all these other companies
[00:13:07] that are coming, it's fragmented the talent.
[00:13:10] But what happens when you fragment the talent, unfortunately,
[00:13:13] is those startup brokerages don't have the resources
[00:13:16] or the time to train those agents properly.
[00:13:20] And that creates, now we've got an industry full
[00:13:25] of the blind leading the blind.
[00:13:28] And it gets chaotic.
[00:13:29] And you can ask any veteran agent most of the time,
[00:13:33] it's the new agents that are exciting to watch
[00:13:37] when they're growing, but they're also the ones
[00:13:39] that tend to get in the way.
[00:13:41] And it's not their fault.
[00:13:42] It's because nobody's teaching them.
[00:13:43] That's why I said earlier, it's far too easy
[00:13:46] to get a real estate license because real estate pre-license
[00:13:49] course, they don't teach you anything about the business.
[00:13:52] You know, that's all law and agency and all of those
[00:13:54] sort of things, but don't teach you anything
[00:13:56] about getting through a transaction,
[00:13:57] how to get through a bad appraisal,
[00:13:59] how to get through a bad home inspection.
[00:14:01] And in my opinion, commercial, this is just my opinion,
[00:14:06] commercial and residential should be
[00:14:07] two completely different licenses.
[00:14:09] Why won't you be able to do both is beyond me.
[00:14:13] They are two different animals.
[00:14:15] But back to GRI, what GRI does is takes
[00:14:18] for a small brokerage or brokerage who doesn't have
[00:14:21] a training or mentor program, put those new agents
[00:14:24] through GRI, put them through CRS.
[00:14:27] The CRS and the GRI courses will teach you years and years
[00:14:31] of knowledge that you're not getting just by bumping
[00:14:34] and banging your way through the pinball machine.
[00:14:38] And you learn from, you know, I've said,
[00:14:40] I've got enough credit hours from the School of Hard
[00:14:42] Knox that I could graduate with a master's degree now.
[00:14:45] So, but luckily I was at a brokerage,
[00:14:48] it had a great training program.
[00:14:49] We had some great mentor program in place
[00:14:51] that was very, very helpful.
[00:14:53] So GRI, CRS for residential agents starting up,
[00:14:57] that is one of the first places that I would go
[00:14:59] to start getting a real estate training,
[00:15:01] unless your brokerage offers it.
[00:15:03] Or even in addition to what your brokerage offers.
[00:15:05] Even in addition to what your doctor offers it.
[00:15:07] I intended what I see a lot of,
[00:15:09] there's a lot of training and exercise
[00:15:11] and efforts put in the areas of lead generation.
[00:15:15] Lead generation is awesome.
[00:15:17] But if you get a bunch of leads
[00:15:18] and you don't know how to convert them,
[00:15:20] or you don't know how to keep their transactions together,
[00:15:22] you're shooting fish in a barrel
[00:15:23] and are coming right back to life again
[00:15:25] through another agent somewhere.
[00:15:26] It's a bad experience for everyone all around
[00:15:28] when you don't have knowledge and skills
[00:15:30] to close a transaction.
[00:15:32] Yeah, and let's talk about the current sort of climate
[00:15:36] for REALTORS right now.
[00:15:38] So we're recording this.
[00:15:39] So we're getting close to Thanksgiving.
[00:15:42] 2023, we know interest rates are higher
[00:15:45] than buyers would prefer in relation
[00:15:48] to where they were three years ago,
[00:15:50] not in relation to historic averages,
[00:15:52] but the buyer temperature out there has cooled a bit
[00:15:54] because of interest rates.
[00:15:56] A lot of people are locked in,
[00:15:58] or at least feel maybe locked in to a refinance rate
[00:16:02] they did years ago.
[00:16:03] I know like, I feel this way,
[00:16:04] I have a 3% rate on my primary residence,
[00:16:08] and I don't wanna give that up.
[00:16:11] And so we have a lot of people like me
[00:16:14] who are in a similar situation,
[00:16:16] so there's not much inventory.
[00:16:18] Obviously not as many buyers flooding the market
[00:16:20] and also it's the end of the year
[00:16:22] that tends to slow things down as well.
[00:16:25] So Jerry, you've been doing this 30 years.
[00:16:27] What do you know that people who haven't been through
[00:16:30] this kind of part of the cycle of the business?
[00:16:33] Maybe it's maybe some part of a down cycle.
[00:16:37] What do you know that,
[00:16:37] or what would you say to somebody
[00:16:39] who's struggling right now in this area?
[00:16:43] Great question.
[00:16:44] So where I pride myself mostly DJs in my,
[00:16:49] I have, I'm not one of the top 1% producers
[00:16:53] as we talked about earlier,
[00:16:54] but I can weather the storm
[00:16:56] because I can wear many hats.
[00:16:59] Being as well experienced in both residential and commercial
[00:17:04] as I am, it allows me to adapt in many different ways.
[00:17:08] I can go where the hunt is,
[00:17:10] and I'm very comfortable going where the hunt is.
[00:17:12] There's no conversation with any agent
[00:17:13] that I'm not comfortable having now,
[00:17:15] regardless of what you produce.
[00:17:18] I can hold that conversation with you.
[00:17:20] And there was times when I remember in down markets,
[00:17:25] it wasn't so much,
[00:17:27] where's my next deal?
[00:17:30] It was what can I learn to get me that next lead?
[00:17:33] What can I learn to get me that next deal?
[00:17:35] I've always built my career on being the chaste,
[00:17:39] not the chaser.
[00:17:40] And the way I've done that is by learning things
[00:17:42] and getting in-depth knowledge on different ways to do things.
[00:17:46] So when I came in the business in 1993,
[00:17:49] interest rates were still double digit.
[00:17:51] So when we hear people talk about now,
[00:17:52] the interest rates are climbing, interest rates are climbing.
[00:17:55] My first house was 11.75%.
[00:17:57] And that was on a special lottery drawing rate.
[00:18:00] I had to stand in line at 5.30 in the morning
[00:18:03] to get a lottery ticket to get this special low rate
[00:18:06] of 11.75% and I was one of the people chosen.
[00:18:09] So yes, rates have increased.
[00:18:11] They've doubled from where we were a year or so ago
[00:18:13] in some cases.
[00:18:15] But when those things happened,
[00:18:17] like when 2008, 2009 rolled around,
[00:18:19] there was a huge change for closures
[00:18:21] were coming on the market everywhere.
[00:18:23] So my adaption was if there's four closures
[00:18:26] and things that's coming on the market,
[00:18:28] that means the investors are coming out of the woodwork.
[00:18:30] So how do I get to work with the investors?
[00:18:32] I got to learn the investment game
[00:18:33] and I had some real estate investments before,
[00:18:36] but I could delve deep into figuring out net operating income
[00:18:40] and what is a vacancy factor?
[00:18:43] And what's my cost coming in?
[00:18:46] What's the cost outlay going to be
[00:18:47] for if I purchased this home for 36,000?
[00:18:50] What's it going to cost to get it up to 110
[00:18:52] so you can be profitable,
[00:18:54] learned about holding costs,
[00:18:55] all of those sort of things.
[00:18:56] A lot of it, I knew already in the back of my mind,
[00:19:00] but I moved it to the forefront of the mind.
[00:19:02] So as the market changes and it is changing,
[00:19:05] you need to look at other ways that you can be helpful,
[00:19:10] that you can be of service to the public,
[00:19:12] that you can be of service maybe to other agents
[00:19:14] because when you don't have something to offer,
[00:19:17] there's no reason for anyone to call you.
[00:19:19] So I just got a call yesterday from a gentleman
[00:19:23] who wanted to fight his property taxes.
[00:19:27] His assessment went up considerably
[00:19:30] so we took a look at his properties
[00:19:31] and I called him yesterday and I said,
[00:19:34] said, Chuck, you might want to keep your mouth shut.
[00:19:36] They got you assessed at $65 a square foot.
[00:19:39] Be quiet.
[00:19:41] Don't play that game because you should be higher
[00:19:44] than what they're assessing you at.
[00:19:46] So just that piece of advice and information alone
[00:19:48] was prices to him because he just got to spend $900,000,
[00:19:52] $1,000 on two appraisals.
[00:19:54] So just by giving that information,
[00:19:56] but he's called me multiple times over the last three
[00:19:58] or four years, we've done two or three transactions
[00:20:00] with this gentleman.
[00:20:02] But so the point being, there's always somebody buying something.
[00:20:06] There's always somebody selling something.
[00:20:08] How do you get in front of those people
[00:20:10] and how can you be valuable to that particular part
[00:20:14] of the market?
[00:20:14] When does it become an investor market?
[00:20:16] Be valuable to the investors.
[00:20:18] If it's a buyer's market, be valuable to the buyers.
[00:20:20] But the seller's market be valuable to the sellers
[00:20:23] and just constantly ever changing of adaptability,
[00:20:28] learning to be adaptable to what's in front of you right now.
[00:20:30] I talked to an agent a couple of years ago
[00:20:33] and when the 2008 crash hit,
[00:20:36] his business dropped dramatically.
[00:20:38] So he learned how to fight tax assessments
[00:20:40] and he was charging people, I think $150 or something like that,
[00:20:44] to put together their tax assessment battle.
[00:20:46] He would give them all the information
[00:20:48] and they would go to the board of appeals and fight their taxes.
[00:20:51] But that kept him alive, kept him in the game, kept him relevant.
[00:20:55] And so then when those people, when the market started to turn,
[00:20:57] they come to list or sell.
[00:20:59] He's the guy they call because he got them out of a bad situation
[00:21:01] or whatever.
[00:21:02] So I'm very big on knowing the game,
[00:21:05] not just being in the game, but knowing the game.
[00:21:08] Yeah, I couldn't agree with you more.
[00:21:09] I was, you were giving so many great examples there.
[00:21:12] I was thinking about the current situation
[00:21:15] where I don't know, the percentage is anymore.
[00:21:17] I want to say it's 85% of homeowners in the US
[00:21:20] have a mortgage rate of less than 4%.
[00:21:23] That may not be true with the capital T,
[00:21:25] but it's close enough to where we have a lot of these people
[00:21:28] like myself, anyone who has a mortgage who's refinanced
[00:21:32] or in the last several years probably has a pretty attractive rate.
[00:21:36] So I think there's a huge opportunity for agents
[00:21:38] to start having conversations with people like me,
[00:21:41] people who feel trapped, not trapped,
[00:21:44] but locked into the slow rate and say,
[00:21:46] actually, there are some creative solutions.
[00:21:48] If you did want to move right now,
[00:21:50] there are ways we can sort of navigate through
[00:21:56] high interest rate environments like two,
[00:21:58] like buy downs, for example.
[00:22:01] There are, this is, and this I think is really,
[00:22:05] really where a good agent is separating,
[00:22:08] separate from, you know, it really divides the good agents
[00:22:11] from the not good agents because the good agents
[00:22:14] will call somebody before they call them going,
[00:22:18] hey, I'm thinking about buying or selling right now,
[00:22:20] because maybe there's lots of people right now
[00:22:23] that aren't thinking about that,
[00:22:24] but if it was me, I would be calling everybody I know,
[00:22:26] saying, hey, I just want to give you my take
[00:22:29] on what's going on right now.
[00:22:31] And if you are thinking of a move,
[00:22:33] we do have some options and creative ways to explore that.
[00:22:37] But again, just establishing that, as you said,
[00:22:39] I'm just not in the market, I know the market,
[00:22:41] I know what's going on.
[00:22:43] I think that's so important.
[00:22:44] Yeah, and to touch on what you said about the buy downs,
[00:22:48] there's one of the things right there
[00:22:49] that you should be focusing on right now
[00:22:51] as an agent coming in from the game.
[00:22:53] How does financing work?
[00:22:55] One of the first things that I started learning about
[00:22:57] when I got into business, I would notice,
[00:23:00] and in mind, I was in the business
[00:23:01] before the pre-approval thing was a big deal.
[00:23:05] So now it's pretty much standard,
[00:23:07] but I remember you could get pre-approval letters
[00:23:09] and everybody, that was like gold then.
[00:23:13] But I sat down with a lender,
[00:23:15] named was Brenda Wilde, one day I talked to her on the phone,
[00:23:17] and I said, Brenda, what are my qualifying ratios
[00:23:19] when I'm talking to people?
[00:23:21] I want to know when I'm holding these conversations
[00:23:23] with people about buying it.
[00:23:25] Yes, you can't afford to buy.
[00:23:26] So many times, you, Jay,
[00:23:27] as somebody said, well, I can't afford to buy.
[00:23:29] Well, where are you living now?
[00:23:30] Well, I rent a little apartment.
[00:23:32] How much you paying?
[00:23:32] $1,300 a month?
[00:23:33] Well, $1,300 a month here in the Quad City.
[00:23:36] So our market is about a third of what you
[00:23:38] that are there in Chicago.
[00:23:40] $1,300 a month, a buy you $140,000, $150,000 house.
[00:23:44] And a lot of people don't even realize that.
[00:23:46] So I've had a lot of success in converting renters
[00:23:48] into home buyers because they didn't think
[00:23:51] that they could buy, not realizing what it costs.
[00:23:54] They don't understand down payment,
[00:23:55] they don't understand closing costs.
[00:23:57] So there again, whenever you've got storms like this happening,
[00:24:00] there's usually programs that all of a sudden spring up
[00:24:03] to help keep the market afloat.
[00:24:05] So you learn about first-time home buyer programs.
[00:24:07] You learn about programs for veterans
[00:24:09] that veterans can use.
[00:24:10] There's usually something out there to help people.
[00:24:12] So you have to go learn that program
[00:24:14] because that's face it.
[00:24:16] If you're doing 30, 40 transactions a year,
[00:24:18] then all of a sudden that drops to 15.
[00:24:21] You need to make up that difference somewhere
[00:24:24] if you're gonna stay in the game.
[00:24:26] This is when we see markets like this,
[00:24:27] is when we'll see the agent counts start to drop.
[00:24:29] It happens all the time.
[00:24:31] And the real estate market picks up all of a sudden,
[00:24:34] everybody wants to be a REALTOR
[00:24:36] because they've watched HDTV and they like houses.
[00:24:39] I love that's my reason for getting in the business.
[00:24:41] Because I like houses.
[00:24:42] Okay, let's see how long that lasts
[00:24:43] after you've shown 137 of them in four days.
[00:24:46] But anyhow, just learning where there's always
[00:24:50] an apple to pick somewhere.
[00:24:52] And it's watching closely and learning to see what that is.
[00:24:55] There's always nothing stops dead.
[00:24:57] There's always some movement somewhere.
[00:25:00] Well, you said something really important earlier,
[00:25:02] which was about providing value, being of service.
[00:25:06] And that really is the name of the game
[00:25:08] in my opinion.
[00:25:11] And it's really, I think it's a creative, fun thing
[00:25:16] to consider for your business.
[00:25:19] Because we have this database of customers,
[00:25:22] we have our prospects and we go, gosh, I don't,
[00:25:25] why would I, I don't have any reason to call so and so.
[00:25:30] Well, you should have reasons to call them.
[00:25:31] You should know a lot about every one of your contacts
[00:25:34] in your database.
[00:25:35] You should know what's going on in their lives.
[00:25:38] And if nothing else, if there's nothing to talk about
[00:25:41] with real estate, you could at least contact them
[00:25:43] and celebrate things that they're experiencing
[00:25:46] or helping them with any, like, you know,
[00:25:49] Jerry, for example, is, you know,
[00:25:51] he has been doing this 30 years.
[00:25:52] Do you think he knows the best roofers in town?
[00:25:55] Of course he does.
[00:25:56] He knows the best account and he knows the best inspectors.
[00:25:59] So Jerry is, is this breath, a wide breath of information
[00:26:03] that he gets to then reach out to his sphere
[00:26:07] and say, hey, I'm your guy.
[00:26:08] I know these things.
[00:26:09] And of course, that takes time to develop lists like that.
[00:26:12] But if you can start to put your value proposition together
[00:26:15] and start to think about how can I continuously add value
[00:26:18] people only buy and sell, whatever,
[00:26:20] five to 10 years, seven to 10 years, whatever it is.
[00:26:22] So you better figure out something
[00:26:23] that you can do in those seven to 10 year windows
[00:26:26] where you're going to stay in front of them.
[00:26:28] And it's probably not just your real estate email newsletter.
[00:26:30] Hey, that's fine.
[00:26:31] Whatever it's fine.
[00:26:33] But you should be thinking about other things
[00:26:35] that those customers actually want to learn about
[00:26:39] during that time to obviously just keep your name
[00:26:42] in front of them.
[00:26:43] Yeah. And being very involved with your community.
[00:26:45] That's where Alex has had a huge success.
[00:26:47] Being very involved in your community,
[00:26:49] because you become the source.
[00:26:50] I just had a guy text me here last week.
[00:26:52] He goes, you're my source, man.
[00:26:54] But I need something. You're my source.
[00:26:55] So what a great compliment.
[00:26:57] And Ashley takes this before you and I got online.
[00:27:00] I was texting a previous client who's like,
[00:27:02] hey, I need somebody to put windows in.
[00:27:04] Who do you suggest being that go to source
[00:27:07] that keeps you in front of people a lot of times?
[00:27:09] So being involved with your community is another big way
[00:27:13] because people recognize your name.
[00:27:14] And I've been around long enough now.
[00:27:16] I can be anywhere in my nards or lows.
[00:27:19] And I'll put down my debit card.
[00:27:21] And the person will go, oh, you the real estate guy?
[00:27:23] Yeah, that's awesome.
[00:27:25] You know, they know you for that.
[00:27:27] But yeah, there's this being involved on different levels
[00:27:31] and being of service to everyone around you.
[00:27:35] That part, I think, I've done very well.
[00:27:37] I've been very fortunate to be able to help a lot of people.
[00:27:39] There's a lot of things.
[00:27:41] And a lot of times, DJ, the business comes to me
[00:27:43] just because of those things.
[00:27:45] Not because I'm out pushing my Facebook post
[00:27:49] or I'm the greatest REALTOR into none of that.
[00:27:51] It's just because I've established a relationship
[00:27:54] on a different level through a different avenue.
[00:27:57] And they know you're the real estate guy, right?
[00:27:59] Yeah, why do you ask you buying or selling?
[00:28:01] Well, I'm thinking about selling my mom's house
[00:28:03] whatever.
[00:28:04] Next thing you know, that conversation is going.
[00:28:06] Whenever someone says to me, you're the real estate guy, right?
[00:28:09] I always say, are you buying or selling?
[00:28:11] Yes, I am.
[00:28:12] And then we go from there to conversations, things
[00:28:14] in the something.
[00:28:15] I love that.
[00:28:16] It reminded me of one of one of the interviews
[00:28:19] I had a few years or so ago, where a woman gave a suggestion
[00:28:24] that I had not heard before.
[00:28:26] And it's so simple.
[00:28:27] And that, you know, if you have a local newspaper, for example,
[00:28:31] most, most, you know, markets do.
[00:28:34] And, you know, reach out to whoever
[00:28:36] in charge of the real estate portion of not necessarily
[00:28:40] the advertising.
[00:28:41] But if anyone's, you know, the real estate person
[00:28:43] to talk about what's going on real estate wise in the community
[00:28:46] and start sending them stats.
[00:28:47] Say, hey, Mr. and Mrs. reporter, I've got some stats
[00:28:50] about what's going on out here.
[00:28:51] I thought maybe that would be helpful for you
[00:28:53] because they're looking for content.
[00:28:55] And I said, oh, that's such a smart idea
[00:28:57] because people still read newspapers.
[00:28:58] And as much as we think people don't, some people do, of course.
[00:29:02] And this is another way to get your name out there.
[00:29:05] And to be seen as an expert when you can help a journalist
[00:29:08] with making sense of what's going on out there.
[00:29:11] There's a million ways to do it, to be of service and be of value.
[00:29:15] And I want to make a big, strong push, Jerry,
[00:29:18] with your help to encourage our audience
[00:29:21] to get involved with their local association.
[00:29:25] I want to talk about why that's important
[00:29:28] and how that can benefit the individual.
[00:29:31] Because I wish I would have done that 14 years ago.
[00:29:35] I just started getting involved about five years ago.
[00:29:38] And I wish I could go back and get involved
[00:29:40] at our local level earlier because what it did for me,
[00:29:43] and I'm curious to get your thoughts.
[00:29:45] What it did for me is not only did it, did it, is it a lot of fun?
[00:29:49] And we do a lot of good work.
[00:29:50] And we're here to support the industry,
[00:29:52] the real estate industry.
[00:29:54] And I got to make some wonderful friends along the way,
[00:29:58] people who are like-minded, people who want to see the industry succeed.
[00:30:01] And also just mastermind with all these great agents
[00:30:04] who also give back.
[00:30:06] And so I've learned more about the industry.
[00:30:08] I have a better social life.
[00:30:11] And I'm doing good out there.
[00:30:13] Or I think we're doing some version of good out there.
[00:30:15] So I'm just curious.
[00:30:17] And also there's so many great things the associations offer
[00:30:19] that the members oftentimes don't take advantage of,
[00:30:22] trainings, all sorts of things.
[00:30:24] But I want to make a pitch for everybody
[00:30:26] to consider getting involved and just want to hear your thoughts on that.
[00:30:30] Oh, absolutely.
[00:30:31] There again, when I first got in my career,
[00:30:34] I was so blessed to have Irene Romeo
[00:30:37] who pushed me towards the GRI.
[00:30:38] But I was also still to this day.
[00:30:41] I hear this gentleman's voice.
[00:30:42] I see his face.
[00:30:43] And I ask questions.
[00:30:45] Sometimes I get into a situation and I'll be to myself.
[00:30:48] What would Fred tell me to do?
[00:30:49] Fred Dess, so the best broker in the business as far as I'm concerned.
[00:30:53] He's just a wealth of knowledge.
[00:30:56] And he always has an answer, even if he has to make it up.
[00:31:01] He always has an answer.
[00:31:02] But I just love talking with him.
[00:31:04] He's just full of wisdom.
[00:31:06] But both of those agents were very involved with the,
[00:31:10] both those brokers were very involved with the board.
[00:31:12] They suggested I get involved with the board.
[00:31:15] And I did.
[00:31:15] I got involved with the board very early on
[00:31:17] with the professional standards, the Greenness Committee,
[00:31:20] the regional professional standards,
[00:31:23] sitting on different various committees throughout the board.
[00:31:26] And we have a dynamite board of REALTORS.
[00:31:28] But it teaches you,
[00:31:30] and knowledge do you get to know the players and who's who in real estate.
[00:31:34] But you also see the adversity sometimes
[00:31:38] that people are dealing with from a whole different perspective.
[00:31:41] See, it's very easy as an agent to,
[00:31:43] you have a rub with another agent somewhere
[00:31:45] and you're defending your position.
[00:31:47] But if you get out of yourself and get into what is that person experiencing?
[00:31:53] And by being on the board and hearing,
[00:31:55] especially on the Greenness committees and professional standards,
[00:31:57] you hear those stories and things going on.
[00:31:59] And then you start to have a little,
[00:32:01] little more compassion for it.
[00:32:02] I get it.
[00:32:03] I know why they got in this position.
[00:32:05] But it helps getting yourself in that position,
[00:32:08] you know, at some point in time.
[00:32:10] And it just helps move the board forward as well.
[00:32:13] So I cringe a little bit when somebody complains about something.
[00:32:17] Well, the board raised the rates again.
[00:32:18] Well, of course they did.
[00:32:20] Just look at the economy in general.
[00:32:21] That's not the board trying to goug you.
[00:32:23] The board's trying to keep up.
[00:32:25] So I get a little offended sometimes
[00:32:27] when people complain about a board
[00:32:29] because our board does a lot for us.
[00:32:32] We have a great MLS.
[00:32:33] We have a great key safe system.
[00:32:35] We have great leadership.
[00:32:36] We're in great position financially.
[00:32:38] And that's all from having good people sitting at the table.
[00:32:41] So you learn a lot from the inner workings of the business
[00:32:45] when you're involved at the board level as well.
[00:32:47] It's not you're not seeing it from your little perspective.
[00:32:50] It's seeing it from the overall marketplace that you're in.
[00:32:54] So highly, highly encouraged getting involved with the board
[00:32:57] at some point in time.
[00:32:59] I couldn't agree with you more.
[00:33:01] I think I'd be shocked if it didn't result
[00:33:05] in actually indirectly getting you more business,
[00:33:08] even though that's not why you're going to do it.
[00:33:10] Well, sure, yes.
[00:33:11] Yeah, I think I told you earlier,
[00:33:13] a lot of the commercial referrals I get
[00:33:15] are from residential agents,
[00:33:16] even from other brokerages.
[00:33:18] They have their own brokers and they'll refer me
[00:33:21] people because I can speak their language
[00:33:23] or I've sat on a committee with them.
[00:33:25] And at some point in time, so I've established that relationship.
[00:33:29] You know, there's a great dynamite agent here
[00:33:32] in the Quad Cities.
[00:33:32] His name is John Locust.
[00:33:34] And he's told me once I saw him last year out of the class
[00:33:37] I was teaching and he said, you know,
[00:33:38] you have two reputations in this business,
[00:33:40] one from your peers and one from the public.
[00:33:42] And that is very true.
[00:33:44] That is very true.
[00:33:45] So yeah, I'm going to say that for Jerry.
[00:33:49] Again, we have two reputations in our industry,
[00:33:51] one with our peers.
[00:33:53] Remember, it is called a cooperative commission.
[00:33:56] Everybody, the cooperative compensation.
[00:33:58] And with our clients as well.
[00:34:01] So those are two separate things.
[00:34:03] And oftentimes the relationship between the agent
[00:34:08] and the customer might be different from the agents
[00:34:10] and to other agents.
[00:34:12] And you want to have a good relationship with both
[00:34:14] because you both have to play in the same sandbox.
[00:34:16] Absolutely.
[00:34:17] Absolutely.
[00:34:18] Absolutely.
[00:34:20] Yeah.
[00:34:21] I want to talk about the importance of learning the market.
[00:34:26] So when people are newer to the industry,
[00:34:29] of course, the primary focus is on lead generation
[00:34:32] as it probably should be.
[00:34:34] And they also have to become good at the job,
[00:34:36] which of course we're talking about skills.
[00:34:38] So I want to talk about actually becoming a good REALTOR.
[00:34:42] So there's the marketing side, the lead gen side.
[00:34:45] I've talked about that a ton on the show over the years.
[00:34:49] Million ways to lead generate.
[00:34:51] I would like to speak to you and get some best practices
[00:34:55] in your opinion about if I was a newer agent
[00:34:59] and I'm focusing on a local area,
[00:35:02] how might I start to learn about the actual inventory price
[00:35:08] points?
[00:35:09] What do you recommend?
[00:35:10] Because ultimately you do want to be an expert
[00:35:12] in some geographical area.
[00:35:14] Yeah.
[00:35:15] 
[00:35:15] And again, that's where Alex has excelled.
[00:35:18] He's learned his neighborhood just by walking the streets,
[00:35:22] getting involved with neighborhood associations,
[00:35:23] those sort of things.
[00:35:24] And myself here, because we're in the Quad Cities,
[00:35:27] there's a large difference between the Iowa
[00:35:30] and Illinois sides of the river, valuation-wise.
[00:35:34] Big difference.
[00:35:34] In fact, the joke is for a lot of us,
[00:35:36] it's not the Mississippi rivers, the Mississippi ocean.
[00:35:39] Because there is a huge divide between the two sides
[00:35:42] of the states.
[00:35:43] If you're an outsider coming in,
[00:35:46] a lot of it looks like one big city here to us.
[00:35:49] But from those of us who live here,
[00:35:50] it's very territorial.
[00:35:51] The difference between Iowa and Illinois
[00:35:53] and the Iowans to try to get somebody from Iowa
[00:35:56] to come to Illinois is very difficult,
[00:35:59] although there's one little catch to that.
[00:36:02] But there seems to be more people moving from Illinois
[00:36:05] going to the Iowa side.
[00:36:07] The property taxes are less, those sort of things.
[00:36:09] So by knowing your market is knowing not only the price
[00:36:13] of the home, the sale price of the home,
[00:36:15] how many days on market, that's all stuff
[00:36:17] you can get from your stats.
[00:36:19] And by looking at it.
[00:36:20] But knowing what makes those areas tick,
[00:36:22] what makes those neighborhoods work?
[00:36:24] Like Alex talks about the neighborhoods that he's worked in.
[00:36:27] He knows the historical, the history of a lot of those homes.
[00:36:30] He knows who owns those homes.
[00:36:31] He knows who lives in them now, those sort of things.
[00:36:34] Same as myself.
[00:36:35] I look at things more from a very mechanical person.
[00:36:38] I'm blessed with the ability to fix or build anything.
[00:36:41] In fact, 20 minutes before I got online with you,
[00:36:44] I was putting brick and mortar on some columns I'm building
[00:36:47] outside.
[00:36:48] But I learned the neighborhoods from the architecture,
[00:36:53] from the years they were built, from the mechanicals
[00:36:56] that were used to build them.
[00:36:57] Like for example, a simple example would be here.
[00:37:00] We have certain neighborhoods that have this sewer system
[00:37:04] called Orangeburg Pipe.
[00:37:06] Not all four cities have had it.
[00:37:08] Molene hardly used it at all.
[00:37:10] Rock Island uses it a lot.
[00:37:11] Bettendorf, the older parts of Bettendorf,
[00:37:14] used it.
[00:37:14] Northwest Davenport used it a lot.
[00:37:17] It's failing across the board.
[00:37:19] It's getting old enough now that it's collapsing.
[00:37:21] It's not a question of will it collapse?
[00:37:23] It's just when.
[00:37:24] So by when I'm representing buyers going
[00:37:26] through those particular neighborhoods,
[00:37:28] I'm asking, is that house in the Orangeburg Pipe
[00:37:32] used there?
[00:37:32] Because that's going to set forth an inspection
[00:37:34] that maybe I would not use in Molene.
[00:37:37] So knowing your market that way, not only valuations and whites,
[00:37:40] but what makes that neighborhood work?
[00:37:43] Where are the city streets?
[00:37:44] Where is their development coming?
[00:37:46] Like if you go to Bettendorf and North Davenport,
[00:37:48] you know, the 53rd Avenue corridor,
[00:37:50] I know you don't know what that is.
[00:37:52] But 20 years ago, that was cornfield.
[00:37:54] Now it's 200,000 plus per acre to go out there.
[00:37:58] So if I'm leading an investor and he's
[00:38:01] going to be looking forward long term by and whole properties,
[00:38:04] let's go where the growth is next.
[00:38:06] You know, so are cash flow maybe a little less right now.
[00:38:09] But in the end result of property value increase.
[00:38:13] So it's knowing the market that way as well,
[00:38:15] and not just average sale price and things of that nature.
[00:38:20] There's so many other things.
[00:38:21] The Indian Transit values is what I call it.
[00:38:23] What else is happening there?
[00:38:25] Are there school closings coming up?
[00:38:26] Or are there school boards emerging?
[00:38:29] Is there, we just had a new Amazon development
[00:38:31] that come in to town here this year?
[00:38:33] You know, where is that?
[00:38:34] What's going to happen around that area?
[00:38:36] We have an area called the TBK that's growing
[00:38:38] like wildfire out there.
[00:38:40] Those sort of things.
[00:38:41] It's knowing the market from that aspect as well
[00:38:44] as the dollar values and things of that nature.
[00:38:46] Does that make sense?
[00:38:47] It makes perfect sense.
[00:38:49] I was just thinking the one specific example
[00:38:51] about the Amazon like a distribution center
[00:38:53] or whatever's coming out your way.
[00:38:56] That's a really interesting sort of comment
[00:38:59] because there is opportunity there.
[00:39:02] Because now we know they're going to be hiring people
[00:39:04] to work at this particular plant or maybe they already have
[00:39:07] people there.
[00:39:08] But just getting curious about what is that going to do?
[00:39:11] Where are those people going to come from
[00:39:13] who are going to work there?
[00:39:15] Where will those people maybe live?
[00:39:17] What would their commute look like?
[00:39:18] If they are coming from further away
[00:39:21] and maybe they now want to move closer to the facility,
[00:39:25] where are the school districts that are desirable for people?
[00:39:28] Understanding that what the needs of those,
[00:39:33] what here's what's coming, situations,
[00:39:36] I think are make you just incredibly valuable.
[00:39:39] You're more proactive than reactive.
[00:39:42] 
[00:39:42] Yes.
[00:39:43] I wanted to also switch gears and talk a little bit
[00:39:46] about commercial because we have about 800 agents
[00:39:50] in our firm and boy, a lot of them
[00:39:52] who are really residential agents go,
[00:39:54] I would like to dabble a little bit in commercial.
[00:39:57] And of course, that's like what does that even mean?
[00:39:59] Because there's lots of different sectors of commercial.
[00:40:01] And of course, it's not just a,
[00:40:03] you can't paint it all with the same brush,
[00:40:05] commercial could be lots and lots of different things.
[00:40:08] But you really straddle both,
[00:40:10] which is impressive and difficult.
[00:40:12] So I'm curious about how did you get into commercial and why?
[00:40:17] Being a business owner in the past,
[00:40:22] commercial use was important to me
[00:40:26] because I needed space.
[00:40:27] I needed a shop space.
[00:40:28] And it's probably one of the cause I get most
[00:40:30] is for people for shop space.
[00:40:31] But I guess had an interest in it and watching it.
[00:40:36] And I like math and working with numbers,
[00:40:38] you work with numbers a lot.
[00:40:40] And I noticed it was a void.
[00:40:41] There was a void in that marketplace
[00:40:43] as far as people being serviced.
[00:40:47] And a lot of it was from intimidation.
[00:40:50] A person wants to start a business
[00:40:52] and they're not sure where they're going to find space
[00:40:54] or they don't know what a triple net lease is.
[00:40:57] They don't know the difference between a triple net
[00:40:58] and a gross.
[00:40:59] And they don't know what CAM charges are.
[00:41:01] And it wasn't being explained to them on many levels.
[00:41:04] And there used to be signs.
[00:41:06] I remember seeing signs up that would say,
[00:41:08] in front of a space that would say available.
[00:41:10] What does available mean?
[00:41:12] Is it mean is for sales?
[00:41:13] I mean, is for rent?
[00:41:14] What does available mean?
[00:41:15] And so I just started learning the language itself
[00:41:18] and managed to get into a couple of transactions
[00:41:21] and started learning from there.
[00:41:23] But there's the difference, DJ.
[00:41:25] I started learning.
[00:41:26] I didn't just do the transaction
[00:41:27] and get a commission and walk away.
[00:41:29] I wanted to know the why.
[00:41:31] How does it work?
[00:41:32] So we started doing a lot of reading leases.
[00:41:35] Just going through them and reading,
[00:41:37] what does that mean?
[00:41:38] Calling their turn and say, OK, this clause says this.
[00:41:40] What exactly does that mean?
[00:41:41] And took a CCIM course, some different CCIM courses,
[00:41:45] reading articles in Real Through Magazine,
[00:41:48] truly learning what it's like,
[00:41:50] or what it is to be a commercial practitioner.
[00:41:52] Because I truly believe with a whole of my heart
[00:41:54] that commercial and residential should be
[00:41:56] two different licenses.
[00:41:59] And they're not.
[00:42:01] And unfortunately, I was looking at one of your podcasts
[00:42:04] from another gentleman I came here and worries from.
[00:42:06] But he's talked about staying in your lane
[00:42:08] and referring out.
[00:42:09] I think he said he bought his own house.
[00:42:11] He referred to a residential agent to buy his own house
[00:42:14] because he didn't know that area.
[00:42:16] And unfortunately, our license gives us the ability
[00:42:18] to list and sell just about anything.
[00:42:22] And that creates problems.
[00:42:25] And the commercial practitioners,
[00:42:26] they get irritated with a residential person
[00:42:29] is trying to do a deal with them.
[00:42:32] And I can see why.
[00:42:33] Then that agent will call me and say,
[00:42:35] well, he won't talk to me or won't give me an information.
[00:42:37] And it's because you're not going to know what to do
[00:42:39] with it if they gave it to you.
[00:42:40] And if you're going to represent a tenant, for example,
[00:42:43] let's take a tenant that's going to go and lease this space.
[00:42:47] And it's $13 a square foot net lease.
[00:42:50] And you've got a cam of $7 a square foot.
[00:42:52] And you can't calculate that rent.
[00:42:54] Or you look at their lease and you can't determine
[00:42:56] if it has an escalation clause and what is that escalation clause?
[00:42:59] What is the escalation clause based on?
[00:43:02] As far as the rent increase, those sort of things
[00:43:04] are so much trouble that you can get a person into
[00:43:09] because you didn't know how to play that particular game
[00:43:13] or didn't know how to guide them.
[00:43:15] And you should really stay out of that.
[00:43:16] Because if you think about it, I take it very personal
[00:43:19] as my responsibility.
[00:43:21] If I'm representing a tenant and I'm getting
[00:43:23] a review, it's time to move into all of that long joining
[00:43:42] team and stay out of this moment.
[00:43:48] 
[00:43:48] 
[00:43:48] at the moment again?
[00:43:49] 
[00:43:49] I'm not really going to say now
[00:43:50] 
[00:43:50] 
[00:43:50] We should note in situation that people
[00:43:51] can't think too far a neighbor with a gay member
[00:43:53] 
[00:43:53] So if you're going to do a commercial to you use the term dabble, I hear that all the time. I don't have a dabble and commercial don't double
[00:44:00] You're the financial responsibility that you have for that client is huge
[00:44:07] And it could be the determining factor of their business profitable or not because you got them in a bad lease and a bad
[00:44:13] Position or something where they made a bad purchase and there's so much more than just pricing and dollar per square foot
[00:44:19] And all that is what are the environmental what's the environmental outlet look like?
[00:44:22] You know, there's a potential problems there. I lost the listing once because
[00:44:27] I noticed a test spot on the building and I asked the gentleman about it and he's like, oh, that's nothing. I'm like
[00:44:33] No, it's not nothing because across the parking lot as he had trailer over there
[00:44:37] This is environmental survey or something like what what what is this all about come to find out he had been contaminated by a neighboring gas station
[00:44:45] He didn't want he want to know that and so when I ask him to prove to me. You've got a clean site
[00:44:49] It cost him $5,000, but it made him angry and he pulled the listing from me and I was okay with that
[00:44:57] I'm okay with that take that listing if can't be honest with it, but
[00:45:01] Yeah, so you've got to know the game is more than just making a commission because you can make huge especially in commercial
[00:45:08] You can make some really big mistakes and people are relying on you the expert and you did not give them expert advice
[00:45:18] Yeah, I agree so if you know or at the very least
[00:45:22] Partner with a commercial agent and be you know, there are apprentices or or be their shadow
[00:45:29] While you are educating yourself on the transaction just make make your life as easy as possible
[00:45:37] Don't don't take on clients that you can't
[00:45:40] Yeah, it's just not gonna work. It's not only make your life easy
[00:45:44] But it's take care of that client the best way you can and some way you know
[00:45:48] I would not go to my dentist to get my ankle operated on
[00:45:51] They're both in the medical profession, but you know, they'd be able to figure it out maybe but no
[00:45:57] I take that responsibility very very personally and I wish more agents would do so
[00:46:03] There's a lot to know in the commercial world and you need to learn that game
[00:46:07] Yes, you can bang your way through. I'm happy to help anyone who will get through a transaction, but
[00:46:13] Don't partner very often. I've been asked to do 50 50. I've always turned it down except for one occasion
[00:46:20] Because it won't be 50 50 it'd be more like 75 25 and so I have offered it if someone wants to 50 50 look
[00:46:28] I'll coach you through if you want to try the
[00:46:30] If you want to try the transaction, but you need to put in your time
[00:46:34] You need to serve your pain because there's a lot to learn. It's not gonna be as easy as you think it is
[00:46:41] Yeah, I agree I think for everyone listening right now there's there you know to sort of recap everything
[00:46:48] Jerry was was talking about on the show
[00:46:50] We on this episode. I think we're really speaking of his competence and I think or skill development
[00:46:56] Maybe it's a better way to say it. Let's make
[00:46:59] 2024 the year of skill development. So what what how are you gonna do that?
[00:47:03] Well, you're going to lean on your brokerage for additional trainings

And we have some really exciting things planned for 2024. So stay tuned for that. But let's get to the main event. My conversation with Jerry Wolking. Today on the show, my guest is Jerry Wolking from Keller, Williams, greater quad cities, which is actually Illinois and Iowa. So there's four cities for those of you not in the Midwest and not familiar with, I guess, Quad cities with self-explanatory. But it actually borders two states, Illinois and Iowa. But let me tell you more about Jerry. By the way, before I get into Jerry's bio, Jerry is Alex Wolking's father. Alex is somebody we featured recently on our show. We were so incredibly impressed with Alex. And if you haven't listened to an episode, I'd really encourage you to do that. And Alex has like, I learned everything for my dad. So we're like, we probably should bring his dad on too, who's also a very successful agent for 30 plus years. But let me go through more of Jerry's bio. Jerry's been in the business since April of 1993. That is 30 plus years. Congratulations. He started as a part-time agent. Like so many of us and became a full-time agent a year later in 1994 after selling his landscape company. He is licensed in Iowa and Illinois. And Jerry is one of these rare types of agents who is able to successfully boot residential and commercial. So we're going to talk a little bit about how he manages both of those lanes. He is also a graduate of the REALTORS Institute and a certified negotiation expert. In my opinion, the most one of the designations I think agents should explore because certainly is something you can tell your clients that you are a certified negotiation expert. I'm a huge fan of that. Also, Jerry has served on the Professional Standards Committee. The Grievance Committee and the Commercial Committee and now teaches classes to REALTORS on various topics at his local association. Jerry, oh, I'm sorry, find, you can learn more about Jerry at his website. We will have a link to this in the show notes and in the description, which is qcbizboxqcbiz.exe.com and goes over what Jerry is all about. Jerry, welcome to the show. Thank you, sir. Well, Jerry and I just had, we were just talking sort of backstage of, if that's the right expression and it was really a lot of fun because Jerry is, you're so much like your son and he is just such a wonderful young man in this Chicago market and we're so grateful to have him on the show and now we're so happy to have you. So you've been doing this. Congratulations on 30 years, by the way. Yes, sir. Yes, you've been a long haul. That's perfect. Well, you know, right now, actually, Jerry, let's talk about how you got in. So I know you were in landscaping, you had a business and why the switch from landscaping to, you know, I guess the way I think about it, landscaping is one of those industries that seems to never go out of fashion and real estate say people have to live somewhere. People need to maintain their properties, their lawns, et cetera. So why the switch from landscaping all those industries? Well, thank you for asking. I've done many, many things, DJ. I've had a very, I tell people all the time, if I died tomorrow, I have lived the full life. I've been a drummer in a heavy metal band for a long time. I raised motorcycles in my professionally. I sold life insurance. I was a welder at John Deere. I've been an auto mechanic. I've been a contractor many, many different things and I found a love of landscape back in the late 80s, early 90s and still do a lot of it today. But, you know, the body only holds up for so long. They don't make a laptop that'll plant a 400 pound tree. So that takes its toll after a while. But I had always had an interest in real estate. And here in the Midwest, in landscape season, it's pretty short-lived. And when it gets November, December, and all of a sudden, there's no lawns to mow, there you're not planting flowers and the ground is frozen for doing any planting. So the winters would be scarce, very scarce. And I was actually working in a body shop and I was getting paid $100 a car to paint cars out in Geneseo, Illinois. No heat, had a little space heater. And this guy was flipping cars. He gave me a hundred bucks a car to paint them. I was miserable. And I was sitting in this little office and I happened to be reading a newspaper on my lunch break and it said, a career in real estate, reading in the newspaper. And I'm like, I've always had an interest in real estate to see what it's like. So I had to borrow the money, long story short. I was so broke I couldn't pay attention. I had to borrow the money to go to my real estate class started. And I did. And went through it, passed the class with flying colors, passed my test. And then next year, here I am, a real estate agent. And that was in April of 93. Still had my landscape company. And as you know, real estate being a commission business, I'd never worked in a commission world before. It was scarce to start with. Because it is far too easy. Here's my quote of the day. It is far too easy to get a real estate license. There are so many people in this industry who shouldn't be in it. And let me preface DJ by saying, I'm probably going to say something that it's been someone today because I love your show. The name of your show is very fitting. So we're going to get real here today. Let's get real. Yeah, there you go. So I started out like most other agents taking open houses from the big producers who didn't want to do them. And at the time I was working for one of the largest brokers in the Quad Cities. They were the largest broker in the Quad Cities at the time. And we had this thing called Florida Duty, where you could sit at this table in this little office for two hour shifts. Each agent got two hour shifts. And any phone calls that came into the office inquiring about listings went to the Florida Duty person. And that was your business to capitalize. So I was taking as many Florida duty sessions as I could get. Most of them in the evening hours, five to seven, five to six. Because I was out planting trees and mowing lawns during the day. And what had happened was I was getting busy enough after a Florida duty in open houses that I would literally change clothes three and four times a day. I would go out in mow two lawns, change clothes, go show a house, go out in plant two trees, change clothes, go out and show a house. That was going on and on for months. And the turning point for me was I had a showing at a condominium in East Moline. And I was planting trees all day. I was mud from head to toe. And I was late for my appointment, like 15 minutes late. And I did not have time to go home and change clothes. So I drove to the appointment with my rig, had my mowers and everything sticking out the back. I'm in my landscape gear. I'm mud from knees down to my boots, dried mud. And as I walk up to the shore and them 15 minutes late, and the gentleman is sitting on the front porch of this condo on the front stoop. And I said, hi, my name's Jerry Walking. I'm the REALTOR here to show you the property. And he dislooped at me. And he goes, are you a real estate agent? And I said, yes, sir. And I also landscaped company. And this was the turning point in my career. This day, this gentleman looked at me at a very stern look on his face. And he said, I'm not interested in a part-time agent. The next week, the next week, I sold the company. I sold the landscape company and went 100% in two real estate. That was a big jump. And I went five months, my first five months with no paycheck. And I'd been used to having steady income. I had employees, I had trucks. I had plenty of contracts to do. I sold my company to my dad, who was retired from the military, looking for something to do. He, by the way, today still runs that same company to this day off of a lot of the same clients that we had back in the early 90s. But it was that push of that gentleman telling to me, telling me I'm not interested in a part-time agent that made me go, I can't do this anymore. I can't continue to go changing clothes. Three or four times a day, this went on for months. It was wearing me out. And I wasn't succeeding at a high level at either position, though, because I'm part-time, landscape or part-time most-day agent. So it was probably the greatest slap of reality I could ever get for him to say that. And that's when it turned. And I started taking off from there. And I was lucky enough to have a broker by the name of Irene Romeo, who said to me, you've got great stuff, kid. You need to go to GRI now. That's where you need to get. So I did my first full-time year. I started GRI. I think you did a fall session, spring session, fall session. I did them consecutively, learned a lot. And it catapulted me forward on being able to get my business started and growing. So I've been surrounded by a lot of great people who helped me get started and saw something in me that was worth nurturing. So I'm very fortunate that way. And for any of our listeners who aren't familiar with GRI, do you mind sharing just a little bit about what that is for? Yeah, that's a graduate Rilters Institute. One of the things I noticed today, we are have written several real estate classes. My partner, Deborah and I, we've written classes. She does all the technical stuff, the PowerPoints and all that. And we presented these classes to Rilters. And now the board of Rilters has picked them up. But GRI is a segment of classes from everything, about marketing, about personal growth, about the Rilters State industry, about appraisal. It's a great place for residential agents to go and get a lot of education in a short period of time. Because that's like four and five consecutive days of classes. And one of the things that I have noticed is now, is brokerages, at least in our area, and please know everything I'm saying is based on our area, because that's what I know. They're fragmenting so much. It used to be in the early 90s. There were two 800 pound gorillas here in town. And they controlled everything. One of them controlled 52% of the market at one time. So every other house was listed by this brokerage. Well, as these other companies have come into play, Keller Williams, eXp, and all these other companies that are coming, it's fragmented the talent. But what happens when you fragment the talent, unfortunately, is those startup brokerages don't have the resources or the time to train those agents properly. And that creates, now we've got an industry full of the blind leading the blind. And it gets chaotic. And you can ask any veteran agent most of the time, it's the new agents that are exciting to watch when they're growing, but they're also the ones that tend to get in the way. And it's not their fault. It's because nobody's teaching them. That's why I said earlier, it's far too easy to get a real estate license because real estate pre-license course, they don't teach you anything about the business. You know, that's all law and agency and all of those sort of things, but don't teach you anything about getting through a transaction, how to get through a bad appraisal, how to get through a bad home inspection. And in my opinion, commercial, this is just my opinion, commercial and residential should be two completely different licenses. Why won't you be able to do both is beyond me. They are two different animals. But back to GRI, what GRI does is takes for a small brokerage or brokerage who doesn't have a training or mentor program, put those new agents through GRI, put them through CRS. The CRS and the GRI courses will teach you years and years of knowledge that you're not getting just by bumping and banging your way through the pinball machine. And you learn from, you know, I've said, I've got enough credit hours from the School of Hard Knox that I could graduate with a master's degree now. So, but luckily I was at a brokerage, it had a great training program. We had some great mentor program in place that was very, very helpful. So GRI, CRS for residential agents starting up, that is one of the first places that I would go to start getting a real estate training, unless your brokerage offers it. Or even in addition to what your brokerage offers. Even in addition to what your doctor offers it. I intended what I see a lot of, there's a lot of training and exercise and efforts put in the areas of lead generation. Lead generation is awesome. But if you get a bunch of leads and you don't know how to convert them, or you don't know how to keep their transactions together, you're shooting fish in a barrel and are coming right back to life again through another agent somewhere. It's a bad experience for everyone all around when you don't have knowledge and skills to close a transaction. Yeah, and let's talk about the current sort of climate for REALTORS right now. So we're recording this. So we're getting close to Thanksgiving. 2023, we know interest rates are higher than buyers would prefer in relation to where they were three years ago, not in relation to historic averages, but the buyer temperature out there has cooled a bit because of interest rates. A lot of people are locked in, or at least feel maybe locked in to a refinance rate they did years ago. I know like, I feel this way, I have a 3% rate on my primary residence, and I don't wanna give that up. And so we have a lot of people like me who are in a similar situation, so there's not much inventory. Obviously not as many buyers flooding the market and also it's the end of the year that tends to slow things down as well. So Jerry, you've been doing this 30 years. What do you know that people who haven't been through this kind of part of the cycle of the business? Maybe it's maybe some part of a down cycle. What do you know that, or what would you say to somebody who's struggling right now in this area? Great question. So where I pride myself mostly DJs in my, I have, I'm not one of the top 1% producers as we talked about earlier, but I can weather the storm because I can wear many hats. Being as well experienced in both residential and commercial as I am, it allows me to adapt in many different ways. I can go where the hunt is, and I'm very comfortable going where the hunt is. There's no conversation with any agent that I'm not comfortable having now, regardless of what you produce. I can hold that conversation with you. And there was times when I remember in down markets, it wasn't so much, where's my next deal? It was what can I learn to get me that next lead? What can I learn to get me that next deal? I've always built my career on being the chaste, not the chaser. And the way I've done that is by learning things and getting in-depth knowledge on different ways to do things. So when I came in the business in 1993, interest rates were still double digit. So when we hear people talk about now, the interest rates are climbing, interest rates are climbing. My first house was 11.75%. And that was on a special lottery drawing rate. I had to stand in line at 5.30 in the morning to get a lottery ticket to get this special low rate of 11.75% and I was one of the people chosen. So yes, rates have increased. They've doubled from where we were a year or so ago in some cases. But when those things happened, like when 2008, 2009 rolled around, there was a huge change for closures were coming on the market everywhere. So my adaption was if there's four closures and things that's coming on the market, that means the investors are coming out of the woodwork. So how do I get to work with the investors? I got to learn the investment game and I had some real estate investments before, but I could delve deep into figuring out net operating income and what is a vacancy factor? And what's my cost coming in? What's the cost outlay going to be for if I purchased this home for 36,000? What's it going to cost to get it up to 110 so you can be profitable, learned about holding costs, all of those sort of things. A lot of it, I knew already in the back of my mind, but I moved it to the forefront of the mind. So as the market changes and it is changing, you need to look at other ways that you can be helpful, that you can be of service to the public, that you can be of service maybe to other agents because when you don't have something to offer, there's no reason for anyone to call you. So I just got a call yesterday from a gentleman who wanted to fight his property taxes. His assessment went up considerably so we took a look at his properties and I called him yesterday and I said, said, Chuck, you might want to keep your mouth shut. They got you assessed at $65 a square foot. Be quiet. Don't play that game because you should be higher than what they're assessing you at. So just that piece of advice and information alone was prices to him because he just got to spend $900,000, $1,000 on two appraisals. So just by giving that information, but he's called me multiple times over the last three or four years, we've done two or three transactions with this gentleman. But so the point being, there's always somebody buying something. There's always somebody selling something. How do you get in front of those people and how can you be valuable to that particular part of the market? When does it become an investor market? Be valuable to the investors. If it's a buyer's market, be valuable to the buyers. But the seller's market be valuable to the sellers and just constantly ever changing of adaptability, learning to be adaptable to what's in front of you right now. I talked to an agent a couple of years ago and when the 2008 crash hit, his business dropped dramatically. So he learned how to fight tax assessments and he was charging people, I think $150 or something like that, to put together their tax assessment battle. He would give them all the information and they would go to the board of appeals and fight their taxes. But that kept him alive, kept him in the game, kept him relevant. And so then when those people, when the market started to turn, they come to list or sell. He's the guy they call because he got them out of a bad situation or whatever. So I'm very big on knowing the game, not just being in the game, but knowing the game. Yeah, I couldn't agree with you more. I was, you were giving so many great examples there. I was thinking about the current situation where I don't know, the percentage is anymore. I want to say it's 85% of homeowners in the US have a mortgage rate of less than 4%. That may not be true with the capital T, but it's close enough to where we have a lot of these people like myself, anyone who has a mortgage who's refinanced or in the last several years probably has a pretty attractive rate. So I think there's a huge opportunity for agents to start having conversations with people like me, people who feel trapped, not trapped, but locked into the slow rate and say, actually, there are some creative solutions. If you did want to move right now, there are ways we can sort of navigate through high interest rate environments like two, like buy downs, for example. There are, this is, and this I think is really, really where a good agent is separating, separate from, you know, it really divides the good agents from the not good agents because the good agents will call somebody before they call them going, hey, I'm thinking about buying or selling right now, because maybe there's lots of people right now that aren't thinking about that, but if it was me, I would be calling everybody I know, saying, hey, I just want to give you my take on what's going on right now. And if you are thinking of a move, we do have some options and creative ways to explore that. But again, just establishing that, as you said, I'm just not in the market, I know the market, I know what's going on. I think that's so important. Yeah, and to touch on what you said about the buy downs, there's one of the things right there that you should be focusing on right now as an agent coming in from the game. How does financing work? One of the first things that I started learning about when I got into business, I would notice, and in mind, I was in the business before the pre-approval thing was a big deal. So now it's pretty much standard, but I remember you could get pre-approval letters and everybody, that was like gold then. But I sat down with a lender, named was Brenda Wilde, one day I talked to her on the phone, and I said, Brenda, what are my qualifying ratios when I'm talking to people? I want to know when I'm holding these conversations with people about buying it. Yes, you can't afford to buy. So many times, you, Jay, as somebody said, well, I can't afford to buy. Well, where are you living now? Well, I rent a little apartment. How much you paying? $1,300 a month? Well, $1,300 a month here in the Quad City. So our market is about a third of what you that are there in Chicago. $1,300 a month, a buy you $140,000, $150,000 house. And a lot of people don't even realize that. So I've had a lot of success in converting renters into home buyers because they didn't think that they could buy, not realizing what it costs. They don't understand down payment, they don't understand closing costs. So there again, whenever you've got storms like this happening, there's usually programs that all of a sudden spring up to help keep the market afloat. So you learn about first-time home buyer programs. You learn about programs for veterans that veterans can use. There's usually something out there to help people. So you have to go learn that program because that's face it. If you're doing 30, 40 transactions a year, then all of a sudden that drops to 15. You need to make up that difference somewhere if you're gonna stay in the game. This is when we see markets like this, is when we'll see the agent counts start to drop. It happens all the time. And the real estate market picks up all of a sudden, everybody wants to be a REALTOR because they've watched HDTV and they like houses. I love that's my reason for getting in the business. Because I like houses. Okay, let's see how long that lasts after you've shown 137 of them in four days. But anyhow, just learning where there's always an apple to pick somewhere. And it's watching closely and learning to see what that is. There's always nothing stops dead. There's always some movement somewhere. Well, you said something really important earlier, which was about providing value, being of service. And that really is the name of the game in my opinion. And it's really, I think it's a creative, fun thing to consider for your business. Because we have this database of customers, we have our prospects and we go, gosh, I don't, why would I, I don't have any reason to call so and so. Well, you should have reasons to call them. You should know a lot about every one of your contacts in your database. You should know what's going on in their lives. And if nothing else, if there's nothing to talk about with real estate, you could at least contact them and celebrate things that they're experiencing or helping them with any, like, you know, Jerry, for example, is, you know, he has been doing this 30 years. Do you think he knows the best roofers in town? Of course he does. He knows the best account and he knows the best inspectors. So Jerry is, is this breath, a wide breath of information that he gets to then reach out to his sphere and say, hey, I'm your guy. I know these things. And of course, that takes time to develop lists like that. But if you can start to put your value proposition together and start to think about how can I continuously add value people only buy and sell, whatever, five to 10 years, seven to 10 years, whatever it is. So you better figure out something that you can do in those seven to 10 year windows where you're going to stay in front of them. And it's probably not just your real estate email newsletter. Hey, that's fine. Whatever it's fine. But you should be thinking about other things that those customers actually want to learn about during that time to obviously just keep your name in front of them. Yeah. And being very involved with your community. That's where Alex has had a huge success. Being very involved in your community, because you become the source. I just had a guy text me here last week. He goes, you're my source, man. But I need something. You're my source. So what a great compliment. And Ashley takes this before you and I got online. I was texting a previous client who's like, hey, I need somebody to put windows in. Who do you suggest being that go to source that keeps you in front of people a lot of times? So being involved with your community is another big way because people recognize your name. And I've been around long enough now. I can be anywhere in my nards or lows. And I'll put down my debit card. And the person will go, oh, you the real estate guy? Yeah, that's awesome. You know, they know you for that. But yeah, there's this being involved on different levels and being of service to everyone around you. That part, I think, I've done very well. I've been very fortunate to be able to help a lot of people. There's a lot of things. And a lot of times, DJ, the business comes to me just because of those things. Not because I'm out pushing my Facebook post or I'm the greatest REALTOR into none of that. It's just because I've established a relationship on a different level through a different avenue. And they know you're the real estate guy, right? Yeah, why do you ask you buying or selling? Well, I'm thinking about selling my mom's house whatever. Next thing you know, that conversation is going. Whenever someone says to me, you're the real estate guy, right? I always say, are you buying or selling? Yes, I am. And then we go from there to conversations, things in the something. I love that. It reminded me of one of one of the interviews I had a few years or so ago, where a woman gave a suggestion that I had not heard before. And it's so simple. And that, you know, if you have a local newspaper, for example, most, most, you know, markets do. And, you know, reach out to whoever in charge of the real estate portion of not necessarily the advertising. But if anyone's, you know, the real estate person to talk about what's going on real estate wise in the community and start sending them stats. Say, hey, Mr. and Mrs. reporter, I've got some stats about what's going on out here. I thought maybe that would be helpful for you because they're looking for content. And I said, oh, that's such a smart idea because people still read newspapers. And as much as we think people don't, some people do, of course. And this is another way to get your name out there. And to be seen as an expert when you can help a journalist with making sense of what's going on out there. There's a million ways to do it, to be of service and be of value. And I want to make a big, strong push, Jerry, with your help to encourage our audience to get involved with their local association. I want to talk about why that's important and how that can benefit the individual. Because I wish I would have done that 14 years ago. I just started getting involved about five years ago. And I wish I could go back and get involved at our local level earlier because what it did for me, and I'm curious to get your thoughts. What it did for me is not only did it, did it, is it a lot of fun? And we do a lot of good work. And we're here to support the industry, the real estate industry. And I got to make some wonderful friends along the way, people who are like-minded, people who want to see the industry succeed. And also just mastermind with all these great agents who also give back. And so I've learned more about the industry. I have a better social life. And I'm doing good out there. Or I think we're doing some version of good out there. So I'm just curious. And also there's so many great things the associations offer that the members oftentimes don't take advantage of, trainings, all sorts of things. But I want to make a pitch for everybody to consider getting involved and just want to hear your thoughts on that. Oh, absolutely. There again, when I first got in my career, I was so blessed to have Irene Romeo who pushed me towards the GRI. But I was also still to this day. I hear this gentleman's voice. I see his face. And I ask questions. Sometimes I get into a situation and I'll be to myself. What would Fred tell me to do? Fred Dess, so the best broker in the business as far as I'm concerned. He's just a wealth of knowledge. And he always has an answer, even if he has to make it up. He always has an answer. But I just love talking with him. He's just full of wisdom. But both of those agents were very involved with the, both those brokers were very involved with the board. They suggested I get involved with the board. And I did. I got involved with the board very early on with the professional standards, the Greenness Committee, the regional professional standards, sitting on different various committees throughout the board. And we have a dynamite board of REALTORS. But it teaches you, and knowledge do you get to know the players and who's who in real estate. But you also see the adversity sometimes that people are dealing with from a whole different perspective. See, it's very easy as an agent to, you have a rub with another agent somewhere and you're defending your position. But if you get out of yourself and get into what is that person experiencing? And by being on the board and hearing, especially on the Greenness committees and professional standards, you hear those stories and things going on. And then you start to have a little, little more compassion for it. I get it. I know why they got in this position. But it helps getting yourself in that position, you know, at some point in time. And it just helps move the board forward as well. So I cringe a little bit when somebody complains about something. Well, the board raised the rates again. Well, of course they did. Just look at the economy in general. That's not the board trying to goug you. The board's trying to keep up. So I get a little offended sometimes when people complain about a board because our board does a lot for us. We have a great MLS. We have a great key safe system. We have great leadership. We're in great position financially. And that's all from having good people sitting at the table. So you learn a lot from the inner workings of the business when you're involved at the board level as well. It's not you're not seeing it from your little perspective. It's seeing it from the overall marketplace that you're in. So highly, highly encouraged getting involved with the board at some point in time. I couldn't agree with you more. I think I'd be shocked if it didn't result in actually indirectly getting you more business, even though that's not why you're going to do it. Well, sure, yes. Yeah, I think I told you earlier, a lot of the commercial referrals I get are from residential agents, even from other brokerages. They have their own brokers and they'll refer me people because I can speak their language or I've sat on a committee with them. And at some point in time, so I've established that relationship. You know, there's a great dynamite agent here in the Quad Cities. His name is John Locust. And he's told me once I saw him last year out of the class I was teaching and he said, you know, you have two reputations in this business, one from your peers and one from the public. And that is very true. That is very true. So yeah, I'm going to say that for Jerry. Again, we have two reputations in our industry, one with our peers. Remember, it is called a cooperative commission. Everybody, the cooperative compensation. And with our clients as well. So those are two separate things. And oftentimes the relationship between the agent and the customer might be different from the agents and to other agents. And you want to have a good relationship with both because you both have to play in the same sandbox. Absolutely. Absolutely. Absolutely. Yeah. I want to talk about the importance of learning the market. So when people are newer to the industry, of course, the primary focus is on lead generation as it probably should be. And they also have to become good at the job, which of course we're talking about skills. So I want to talk about actually becoming a good REALTOR. So there's the marketing side, the lead gen side. I've talked about that a ton on the show over the years. Million ways to lead generate. I would like to speak to you and get some best practices in your opinion about if I was a newer agent and I'm focusing on a local area, how might I start to learn about the actual inventory price points? What do you recommend? Because ultimately you do want to be an expert in some geographical area. Yeah. And again, that's where Alex has excelled. He's learned his neighborhood just by walking the streets, getting involved with neighborhood associations, those sort of things. And myself here, because we're in the Quad Cities, there's a large difference between the Iowa and Illinois sides of the river, valuation-wise. Big difference. In fact, the joke is for a lot of us, it's not the Mississippi rivers, the Mississippi ocean. Because there is a huge divide between the two sides of the states. If you're an outsider coming in, a lot of it looks like one big city here to us. But from those of us who live here, it's very territorial. The difference between Iowa and Illinois and the Iowans to try to get somebody from Iowa to come to Illinois is very difficult, although there's one little catch to that. But there seems to be more people moving from Illinois going to the Iowa side. The property taxes are less, those sort of things. So by knowing your market is knowing not only the price of the home, the sale price of the home, how many days on market, that's all stuff you can get from your stats. And by looking at it. But knowing what makes those areas tick, what makes those neighborhoods work? Like Alex talks about the neighborhoods that he's worked in. He knows the historical, the history of a lot of those homes. He knows who owns those homes. He knows who lives in them now, those sort of things. Same as myself. I look at things more from a very mechanical person. I'm blessed with the ability to fix or build anything. In fact, 20 minutes before I got online with you, I was putting brick and mortar on some columns I'm building outside. But I learned the neighborhoods from the architecture, from the years they were built, from the mechanicals that were used to build them. Like for example, a simple example would be here. We have certain neighborhoods that have this sewer system called Orangeburg Pipe. Not all four cities have had it. Molene hardly used it at all. Rock Island uses it a lot. Bettendorf, the older parts of Bettendorf, used it. Northwest Davenport used it a lot. It's failing across the board. It's getting old enough now that it's collapsing. It's not a question of will it collapse? It's just when. So by when I'm representing buyers going through those particular neighborhoods, I'm asking, is that house in the Orangeburg Pipe used there? Because that's going to set forth an inspection that maybe I would not use in Molene. So knowing your market that way, not only valuations and whites, but what makes that neighborhood work? Where are the city streets? Where is their development coming? Like if you go to Bettendorf and North Davenport, you know, the 53rd Avenue corridor, I know you don't know what that is. But 20 years ago, that was cornfield. Now it's 200,000 plus per acre to go out there. So if I'm leading an investor and he's going to be looking forward long term by and whole properties, let's go where the growth is next. You know, so are cash flow maybe a little less right now. But in the end result of property value increase. So it's knowing the market that way as well, and not just average sale price and things of that nature. There's so many other things. The Indian Transit values is what I call it. What else is happening there? Are there school closings coming up? Or are there school boards emerging? Is there, we just had a new Amazon development that come in to town here this year? You know, where is that? What's going to happen around that area? We have an area called the TBK that's growing like wildfire out there. Those sort of things. It's knowing the market from that aspect as well as the dollar values and things of that nature. Does that make sense? It makes perfect sense. I was just thinking the one specific example about the Amazon like a distribution center or whatever's coming out your way. That's a really interesting sort of comment because there is opportunity there. Because now we know they're going to be hiring people to work at this particular plant or maybe they already have people there. But just getting curious about what is that going to do? Where are those people going to come from who are going to work there? Where will those people maybe live? What would their commute look like? If they are coming from further away and maybe they now want to move closer to the facility, where are the school districts that are desirable for people? Understanding that what the needs of those, what here's what's coming, situations, I think are make you just incredibly valuable. You're more proactive than reactive. Yes. I wanted to also switch gears and talk a little bit about commercial because we have about 800 agents in our firm and boy, a lot of them who are really residential agents go, I would like to dabble a little bit in commercial. And of course, that's like what does that even mean? Because there's lots of different sectors of commercial. And of course, it's not just a, you can't paint it all with the same brush, commercial could be lots and lots of different things. But you really straddle both, which is impressive and difficult. So I'm curious about how did you get into commercial and why? Being a business owner in the past, commercial use was important to me because I needed space. I needed a shop space. And it's probably one of the cause I get most is for people for shop space. But I guess had an interest in it and watching it. And I like math and working with numbers, you work with numbers a lot. And I noticed it was a void. There was a void in that marketplace as far as people being serviced. And a lot of it was from intimidation. A person wants to start a business and they're not sure where they're going to find space or they don't know what a triple net lease is. They don't know the difference between a triple net and a gross. And they don't know what CAM charges are. And it wasn't being explained to them on many levels. And there used to be signs. I remember seeing signs up that would say, in front of a space that would say available. What does available mean? Is it mean is for sales? I mean, is for rent? What does available mean? And so I just started learning the language itself and managed to get into a couple of transactions and started learning from there. But there's the difference, DJ. I started learning. I didn't just do the transaction and get a commission and walk away. I wanted to know the why. How does it work? So we started doing a lot of reading leases. Just going through them and reading, what does that mean? Calling their turn and say, OK, this clause says this. What exactly does that mean? And took a CCIM course, some different CCIM courses, reading articles in Real Through Magazine, truly learning what it's like, or what it is to be a commercial practitioner. Because I truly believe with a whole of my heart that commercial and residential should be two different licenses. And they're not. And unfortunately, I was looking at one of your podcasts from another gentleman I came here and worries from. But he's talked about staying in your lane and referring out. I think he said he bought his own house. He referred to a residential agent to buy his own house because he didn't know that area. And unfortunately, our license gives us the ability to list and sell just about anything. And that creates problems. And the commercial practitioners, they get irritated with a residential person is trying to do a deal with them. And I can see why. Then that agent will call me and say, well, he won't talk to me or won't give me an information. And it's because you're not going to know what to do with it if they gave it to you. And if you're going to represent a tenant, for example, let's take a tenant that's going to go and lease this space. And it's $13 a square foot net lease. And you've got a cam of $7 a square foot. And you can't calculate that rent. Or you look at their lease and you can't determine if it has an escalation clause and what is that escalation clause? What is the escalation clause based on? As far as the rent increase, those sort of things are so much trouble that you can get a person into because you didn't know how to play that particular game or didn't know how to guide them. And you should really stay out of that. Because if you think about it, I take it very personal as my responsibility. If I'm representing a tenant and I'm getting a review, it's time to move into all of that long joining team and stay out of this moment. at the moment again? I'm not really going to say now We should note in situation that people can't think too far a neighbor with a gay member So if you're going to do a commercial to you use the term dabble, I hear that all the time. I don't have a dabble and commercial don't double You're the financial responsibility that you have for that client is huge And it could be the determining factor of their business profitable or not because you got them in a bad lease and a bad Position or something where they made a bad purchase and there's so much more than just pricing and dollar per square foot And all that is what are the environmental what's the environmental outlet look like? You know, there's a potential problems there. I lost the listing once because I noticed a test spot on the building and I asked the gentleman about it and he's like, oh, that's nothing. I'm like No, it's not nothing because across the parking lot as he had trailer over there This is environmental survey or something like what what what is this all about come to find out he had been contaminated by a neighboring gas station He didn't want he want to know that and so when I ask him to prove to me. You've got a clean site It cost him $5,000, but it made him angry and he pulled the listing from me and I was okay with that I'm okay with that take that listing if can't be honest with it, but Yeah, so you've got to know the game is more than just making a commission because you can make huge especially in commercial You can make some really big mistakes and people are relying on you the expert and you did not give them expert advice Yeah, I agree so if you know or at the very least Partner with a commercial agent and be you know, there are apprentices or or be their shadow While you are educating yourself on the transaction just make make your life as easy as possible Don't don't take on clients that you can't Yeah, it's just not gonna work. It's not only make your life easy But it's take care of that client the best way you can and some way you know I would not go to my dentist to get my ankle operated on They're both in the medical profession, but you know, they'd be able to figure it out maybe but no I take that responsibility very very personally and I wish more agents would do so There's a lot to know in the commercial world and you need to learn that game Yes, you can bang your way through. I'm happy to help anyone who will get through a transaction, but Don't partner very often. I've been asked to do 50 50. I've always turned it down except for one occasion Because it won't be 50 50 it'd be more like 75 25 and so I have offered it if someone wants to 50 50 look I'll coach you through if you want to try the If you want to try the transaction, but you need to put in your time You need to serve your pain because there's a lot to learn. It's not gonna be as easy as you think it is Yeah, I agree I think for everyone listening right now there's there you know to sort of recap everything Jerry was was talking about on the show We on this episode. I think we're really speaking of his competence and I think or skill development Maybe it's a better way to say it. Let's make 2024 the year of skill development. So what what how are you gonna do that? Well, you're going to lean on your brokerage for additional trainings You're going to seek out certifications like gri certified negotiation expert like Jerry who's who's does both You're going to reach out to your local association not just to to maybe serve on a committee But also to find out what are they offering what sort of trainings and support are they providing to agents? Remember we do pay our associations quite a bit of money So there are lots of services. I'm I'm on our member care task force here in Chicago I didn't even know all of the benefits and services that we provide to our members until I now I'm the vice chair of the committee And I still don't know of them all by heart.
