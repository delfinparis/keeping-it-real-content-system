[00:01:31] Welcome to Keeping It Real, the largest podcast for real estate agents and by real estate agents.
[00:01:37] My name is DJ Paris. I am your guide and host through the show today is our monthly series called The Monday Market Minute with Carrie McCormick from the Carrie McCormick real estate group with at properties here in Chicago.
[00:01:50] Now Carrie is a top top top top one percent producer in Chicago with over 24 years of experience helping buyers, sellers and investors.
[00:01:59] In fact, in the past 12 months out of 46,000 real estate agents here in Chicago, Carrie is routinely in the very top 10 and that includes teams and all sorts of other people that really aren't her exact peers.
[00:02:13] But she is as an agent, one of the very, very top producing agents in Chicago. She's a true superstar and expert in everything from first time home buyers, veteran investors and luxury properties.
[00:02:24] She's also in the newspaper a lot with all these cool properties. She gets to represent. She also works with a lot of developers and is often chosen to represent them at their high and developments.
[00:02:33] I live in one of those developments. That's how much of a fan I am of carries and please visit Carrie at Carrie McCormick RE, but more importantly follow her on Instagram.
[00:02:44] She does it all herself and it is probably the best Instagram account I've seen in Chicago for real estate agents, which is Carrie McCormick real estate link in the show notes. Carrie, welcome once again to the show.
[00:02:56] Thank you so much. I think as the years go by, my intro gets longer and longer. We're still 100 years old.
[00:03:04] Well, you know, with age comes wisdom, but you know, it's funny too. I think about this a lot. Like we really not that you're not an older person in this industry at all.
[00:03:16] But I do think that there's a lot of wisdom in people that have been doing this a long time and just we are so lucky to have you on the show because 24 years is pretty impressive and you're not slowing down.
[00:03:29] You're still at the very top of the mountain. So I love chatting with you because you help me in particular keep my cool when things seem to be really chaotic.
[00:03:39] You're like we've been through this before. You know, you've seen many cycles. So excited to get your thoughts.
[00:03:46] You know, today. But yeah, what would you like to talk about?
[00:03:49] Well, I mean, just on that on that note, you know, I think, you know, I do enjoy getting older. I have to say because I do become wiser and I can anticipate all the curves in the road and you know all the changes in the industry and obviously, you know, confidence in our industries.
[00:04:07] And it's very different than ego, right? So there's a big difference between someone who's very ego-tistical or someone who's extremely confident. So I think it's important for people to understand the difference between the two.
[00:04:21] And I do think especially now that things are changing in our industry and not just even in the industry, but it's also just in the world, right?
[00:04:30] We've got AI coming at us. Technology keeps changing. Believe it or not, you know, where in my generation, I started with, you know, Yahoo or AOL and then Google comes along and now a lot of a new generation is using tick-tock.
[00:04:48] They're using YouTube as their search engine and to get information, right? So you, it's important for all of our comfort zone. And that's the hardest thing to do no matter who you are, what industry you are in and what you do is changes hard and getting out of your comfort zone is super hard.
[00:05:11] So I think we're having a content and a tech warfare right now in the world again with all of this AI and all the different platforms that are on there. And one analogy that I like to use is a surfer.
[00:05:25] I'm not a surfer, but I love this analogy because it's, you know, a surfer will live for that big wave to come, right?
[00:05:32] And once that big wave comes, you have a choice. You can either ride the wave and you can, you know, have the best time of your life and succeed or you can sit and watch the wave go by you or get devastated by that wave, right?
[00:05:48] And I look at that analogy as what's happening right now in our world. And that's what I'm saying, get out of your comfort zone and embrace it. And you have to future proof your business and, you know, get on board with this.
[00:06:04] There's also what I'm seeing is what I call a generational divide. Right. So in my generation, never disclose my age, but in my generation or older, you know, if your parents use a certain doctor, your parents use a certain CPA wealth manager, the kids automatically kind of use that, right?
[00:06:27] And there's a lot of industries that were dependent like your wealth manager, like they're dependent on the family that they had that the kids are going to use them and the kids kids are going to use them and the whole family is going to use them.
[00:06:40] Well, that is, I think has changed or is is changing, I should say, is, you know, I work with a lot of younger home sellers and home buyers that they don't want to use their parents REALTOR.
[00:06:54] Right. Because the parents REALTOR, you know, sold or did business in the 80s, 90s, even early 2000s, right? And that broker, which I was in the 90s as a broker, you know, they, they just don't operate the same.
[00:07:11] So we have to look at this new generation and how they do business, how they're searching and buying real estate. Again, I mentioned TikTok, they use YouTube, they, they text, they DM, you know, again, it's completely different.
[00:07:27] So be as real estate agents, it's a time to pivot and it's a time to adapt. It's hard and it's hard to keep up with all of it.
[00:07:36] Yeah, it's interesting. I think a lot about communication is we know that communication typically is the most important sort of quality between the relationship of a REALTOR and their client, whether it's during the transaction before the transaction after the transaction, staying in communication is really the hallmark of any good relationship.
[00:07:58] And the way that, but the way that people communicate changes. So now, whereas I grew up on email and that was, you know, what I thought was the best way to communicate. Well, now that most of most of the agents at our company when we send a company wide email to our REALTOR is they don't read it.
[00:08:14] So we're like, okay, we better send an SMS to because we know that they're going to see that before they see the email. And as much as I hate the fact that they don't check their email, I can hate it all day long and doesn't change the fact that they're not checking their email.
[00:08:28] So I have to adjust if I want to communicate effectively to my to my ages.
[00:08:33] Right. And even, you know, if you do send an email, it's the length of the email, right? You know, I'm a very bullet point person. That's just my personality.
[00:08:41] And again, attention span has changed as well. Right. You know, if I drafted a three paragraph email, they're not going to read through it. It's just they're going to go to the bottom that email. You know, so again, trying to understand the psychology of people's decision making is something we have to to to.
[00:09:03] But also, I think you mentioned communication. I think that is super important and coming up with a solid communication plan for people and having good people skills reading the room, understanding people's personalities, staying in communication with them and offering this is an old school one, but it's so true is offering value when you can because.
[00:09:28] The client, you know, every year, you know, do you want to move? Do you want to buy? No one wants to be sold to right. And, you know, I still get these emails from, you know, whether it's a car company or whatever it is that I purchased, you know, and it's it's so rude, you know, give me some information about.
[00:09:47] I don't know something that's of value to me.
[00:09:50] Yeah, and the cool thing too is that REALTORS do have access to a lot of value added tools. For example, the simplest one that comes to mind that I think most homeowners are always interested in is what's my home worth.
[00:10:03] Now, we can wait for people to seek that out on their own and they can find a million websites that will give them, you know, some estimate or we could be proactive and say, hey, I was thinking about you, you know, Mr. Mrs. Client.
[00:10:15] And I just wanted you to get an update from me about what I think things are headed and where your property is headed.
[00:10:21] And again, that to me, that's value. I love things like that.
[00:10:25] I do too. So, you know, having good, you know, people skills is still going to be important.
[00:10:30] We talked a little bit about that communication plan. I think that's important as far as, you know, follow up.
[00:10:35] We spend so much money to acquire the client or define the client, whether, you know, through all of marketing.
[00:10:41] And once we have it, we got to hold on to it and holding on to it with communication.
[00:10:49] And again, going just back to having confidence is is a best way to hold on to that business.
[00:10:56] Yeah, I what I love is when I'm reaching out to someone for support, whether it's a company or, or, you know, a doctor's office or something, I need something from, you know, one of my vendors I use in my life.
[00:11:08] And I love when they say, how do you prefer to be responded to where they'll say, phone, text or email.
[00:11:15] And then time of day sometimes they'll ask, I love that. And so I know REALTORS, you know, this is an opportunity for you to ask your clients, hey, when do you prefer, you know, do you prefer a phone call and email the text, when do you go, do you have weird hours?
[00:11:30] Also, do you have religious, you know, situations where you don't, uncertain days, you don't want to be communicated with or you're not able to or maybe it's a holiday that I'm not aware of things like that.
[00:11:43] I think all of those things are really, really helpful. And then you just keep a little, you know, track of who needs what went.
[00:11:49] Yeah, we do do that. And it's, it's become, it's kind of funny because like each person has their profile of like their kids nap times.
[00:11:57] And, you know, when they go to bed and, you know, this person, you know, husband wants to be texted wife wants email, don't call her during this time but call him and it's just like you look at it and it's, it's like a menu of this person.
[00:12:10] But, you know, at the end of the day, you know, they are happy about it, right, because we're proud of their product.
[00:12:18] And, you know, it's again, when I talked about the beginning of getting out of the comfort zone and this, you know, the tech warfare that's out there and the content warfare, don't forget just the humanity of our business, right.
[00:12:31] And it's still just being kind to people and, you know, some people gone such the tech route of, you know, not even talking to the clients like, you know, right, it's whether I'm texting them, DMing them or however it is.
[00:12:47] You know, it's don't forget just to be a real human and be kind to people.
[00:12:51] I got an AI recruiting call for another brokerage, yes, if you got any of those, like I just got one the other day and it was so painfully bad.
[00:13:04] It wasn't even close to good, if it was good, I'd be like, okay, that was good.
[00:13:08] So we need to remember that we're not quite there with AI yet. So be careful what you're automating, I think, too, is if it's not coming through in your voice, I don't, I don't mean actual your voice, but I mean you're writing voice, if it's communicating in a way that you wouldn't then do not use it because people see through that in a second.
[00:13:27] And they really just want to feel that you care about them. So whatever you can do to demonstrate care, like you were saying something very important, like you know somebody, for example, a new mother's feeding schedule or you know, approximately when, you know, she may may not be busy.
[00:13:41] She is going to be so flattered when you say, hey, I didn't want to call you during this. I know that was your feeding time. I wanted to, you know, be respectful of that.
[00:13:48] I mean, nobody does that, right? That is a huge, huge value add. You can just do value just by doing that.
[00:13:55] Right, except when you forget the feeding schedule and your column during the middle of it.
[00:13:59] Well, then you say, oh, I'm so sorry, did I catch you in the middle of the feeding time. But the point is, is that you care enough to even think about it or to ask about it.
[00:14:08] And I think that's really what people want. I have one last question. I know what we'll wrap this up, but this is a big question. And you know, you are such an avatar here in Chicago.
[00:14:18] You really are so well respected, not just here. Of course, a lot of a lot of markets. But people want to know our REALTORS in trouble with this, these new changes that are happening.
[00:14:29] I don't want to get into the changes. But do you think we're on the way out? Is there anything that's suggestive that REALTORS won't be needed?
[00:14:37] Absolutely not. I totally disagree with that. Again, it goes back. Yes, there's going to be change that's going to occur. And then we're going to have to pivot.
[00:14:46] But there's such a human. Humanity or not humanity. There's such a human touch to what we do. And the knowledge that we offer our clients. There's no way we're being.
[00:14:57] We're being, you know, replaced whatsoever. Again, there's going to be change and.
[00:15:04] You know, the way we have to handle our business will will change. The good brokers will survive. You know, in any industry when there's big change like that. I don't want to say weeding out people in a bad way, but you know, there's some people that just do this part time or for fun.
[00:15:19] You know, there was people may say, well, forget it. I'm not going to do this anymore.
[00:15:24] Which is fine. You know, but there's still we're still going to be needed.
[00:15:28] Yeah, I and also to the experience of the agent is so critical with experience comes wisdom. And you in particular have been through many market cycles. So if I was buying a property that maybe my largest financial purchase of my life or certainly one of them.
[00:15:45] Do I want, you know, the brand new agent who's never done a deal before to be my agent? Well, probably not. If I had to choose, I'd probably choose somebody who's been through a lot of experience who can say, I know what this is. I've seen this. I've done this. Here's where we're at. Don't worry. I've got it.
[00:16:02] And that it's just like if I go to a doctor, I don't, you know, I had the laser eye surgery many, many, many years ago. And the guys like, yeah, this is like my 12,000 surgery. I was like cool. Cool. It's not your 50th.
[00:16:16] Right. This is the first one I've ever done. Right. No thanks. And by the way, I don't mean to suggest if you're a brand new agent, you can't find business. That is not what I'm suggesting. You can't. You just have to work a little harder.
[00:16:28] And you have to demonstrate. And you probably should consider getting mentor, or getting partnered by somebody partner with somebody like a carry who's like, you know, speaking of that guys for everyone who is listening. We're going to wrap this episode up.
[00:16:41] But if you have clients that either move into Chicago or the Chicago land area or maybe our places where people move out from Chicago to Florida, Texas, Arizona, Colorado, wherever.
[00:16:55] South Carolina sometimes. You know, if you're in some of these we call feeder markets where people go to and from reach out to carry. She gets a lot of business. And she has a lot of business to hand out because her clients move to.
[00:17:09] So carry if there is an agent that wants to connect with you. What would be the best way where they could do that.
[00:17:14] Yeah, so I'm always available 312 9614612 or you can email me. That's carry at ease.com. I'm sure it's going to be somewhere in here.
[00:17:26] We'll have it in the show notes for sure. And carry super easy to to she works all the time. She's always she's pretty much always available and she's always busy. So we're going to let her get back to her busy day closing crazy deals.
[00:17:39] Congratulations just as a on behalf of our audience, which what they don't know is carry is having one of the very might even be your best year ever or certainly right up there.
[00:17:49] So congratulations 24 years and still crushing it is I don't know anyone else who's currently doing that. So congratulations to you. You're amazing. And you come on our show every month as a just being a generous sweet person and we thank you for that.
[00:18:03] So on behalf of everyone we thank carry and on behalf of carry and myself we thank you the audience. We appreciate you. You're the reason we do this show.

Yeah, I what I love is when I'm reaching out to someone for support, whether it's a company or, or, you know, a doctor's office or something, I need something from, you know, one of my vendors I use in my life. And I love when they say, how do you prefer to be responded to where they'll say, phone, text or email. And then time of day sometimes they'll ask, I love that. And so I know REALTORS, you know, this is an opportunity for you to ask your clients, hey, when do you prefer, you know, do you prefer a phone call and email the text, when do you go, do you have weird hours? Also, do you have religious, you know, situations where you don't, uncertain days, you don't want to be communicated with or you're not able to or maybe it's a holiday that I'm not aware of things like that. I think all of those things are really, really helpful. And then you just keep a little, you know, track of who needs what went. Yeah, we do do that. And it's, it's become, it's kind of funny because like each person has their profile of like their kids nap times. And, you know, when they go to bed and, you know, this person, you know, husband wants to be texted wife wants email, don't call her during this time but call him and it's just like you look at it and it's, it's like a menu of this person. But, you know, at the end of the day, you know, they are happy about it, right, because we're proud of their product. And, you know, it's again, when I talked about the beginning of getting out of the comfort zone and this, you know, the tech warfare that's out there and the content warfare, don't forget just the humanity of our business, right. And it's still just being kind to people and, you know, some people gone such the tech route of, you know, not even talking to the clients like, you know, right, it's whether I'm texting them, DMing them or however it is. You know, it's don't forget just to be a real human and be kind to people. I got an AI recruiting call for another brokerage, yes, if you got any of those, like I just got one the other day and it was so painfully bad. It wasn't even close to good, if it was good, I'd be like, okay, that was good. So we need to remember that we're not quite there with AI yet. So be careful what you're automating, I think, too, is if it's not coming through in your voice, I don't, I don't mean actual your voice, but I mean you're writing voice, if it's communicating in a way that you wouldn't then do not use it because people see through that in a second. And they really just want to feel that you care about them. So whatever you can do to demonstrate care, like you were saying something very important, like you know somebody, for example, a new mother's feeding schedule or you know, approximately when, you know, she may may not be busy. She is going to be so flattered when you say, hey, I didn't want to call you during this. I know that was your feeding time. I wanted to, you know, be respectful of that. I mean, nobody does that, right? That is a huge, huge value add. You can just do value just by doing that. Right, except when you forget the feeding schedule and your column during the middle of it. Well, then you say, oh, I'm so sorry, did I catch you in the middle of the feeding time. But the point is, is that you care enough to even think about it or to ask about it. And I think that's really what people want. I have one last question. I know what we'll wrap this up, but this is a big question. And you know, you are such an avatar here in Chicago. You really are so well respected, not just here. Of course, a lot of a lot of markets. But people want to know our REALTORS in trouble with this, these new changes that are happening. I don't want to get into the changes. But do you think we're on the way out? Is there anything that's suggestive that REALTORS won't be needed? Absolutely not. I totally disagree with that. Again, it goes back. Yes, there's going to be change that's going to occur. And then we're going to have to pivot. But there's such a human. Humanity or not humanity. There's such a human touch to what we do. And the knowledge that we offer our clients. There's no way we're being. We're being, you know, replaced whatsoever. Again, there's going to be change and. You know, the way we have to handle our business will will change. The good brokers will survive. You know, in any industry when there's big change like that. I don't want to say weeding out people in a bad way, but you know, there's some people that just do this part time or for fun. You know, there was people may say, well, forget it. I'm not going to do this anymore. Which is fine. You know, but there's still we're still going to be needed. Yeah, I and also to the experience of the agent is so critical with experience comes wisdom. And you in particular have been through many market cycles. So if I was buying a property that maybe my largest financial purchase of my life or certainly one of them. Do I want, you know, the brand new agent who's never done a deal before to be my agent? Well, probably not. If I had to choose, I'd probably choose somebody who's been through a lot of experience who can say, I know what this is. I've seen this. I've done this. Here's where we're at. Don't worry. I've got it. And that it's just like if I go to a doctor, I don't, you know, I had the laser eye surgery many, many, many years ago. And the guys like, yeah, this is like my 12,000 surgery. I was like cool. Cool. It's not your 50th. Right. This is the first one I've ever done. Right. No thanks. And by the way, I don't mean to suggest if you're a brand new agent, you can't find business. That is not what I'm suggesting. You can't. You just have to work a little harder. And you have to demonstrate. And you probably should consider getting mentor, or getting partnered by somebody partner with somebody like a carry who's like, you know, speaking of that guys for everyone who is listening. We're going to wrap this episode up. But if you have clients that either move into Chicago or the Chicago land area or maybe our places where people move out from Chicago to Florida, Texas, Arizona, Colorado, wherever. South Carolina sometimes. You know, if you're in some of these we call feeder markets where people go to and from reach out to carry. She gets a lot of business.
