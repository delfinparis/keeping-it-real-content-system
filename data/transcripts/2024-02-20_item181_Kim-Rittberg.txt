[00:03:02] Oh, Keeping It Real listeners, my absolute favorite podcast. I am Kim Brickberg.
[00:03:06] I help real estate agents get clients, leads and more revenue through video and podcast.
[00:03:12] And I run a video bootcamp program and I do one-on-one work. My background is that I came in from
[00:03:17] TV, being a TV producer and a journalist, and then shifting into digital video at a
[00:03:21] weekly Netflix. And I bring all of that to you as real estate agents so you understand how to
[00:03:26] make great content that really brings in clients. So, talking today about why you should dance on video.
[00:03:35] So I actually am a huge advocate generally of not dancing on video. I think that the whole idea
[00:03:40] of dancing on video is not necessary if you don't like it. Right? The whole idea of like, do a
[00:03:46] dance on Instagram, do a dance on TikTok, be silly. It can work and at other times it won't work.
[00:03:52] It really just depends on who you are. But I'm here today to talk about the times that you
[00:03:56] should be dancing on camera. So I'm going to step back and say when you're thinking about what
[00:04:02] content to be making, really, really important especially for real estate agents to be merging that
[00:04:08] personal and that professional. So a lot of times I work with agents, it's one or the other.
[00:04:13] It's all personal, cats, you walk in your dog, a trip you took with your spouse, your favorite restaurant.
[00:04:24] And your feed should not be totally personal because then someone can't go there and know how they
[00:04:29] can work with you. They're not going to refer you to someone. There are a lot of times people go
[00:04:34] to look at your social page after they're considering working with you. So I've had agents come to
[00:04:38] me and say, oh, I closed the deal because I know they looked at my page and they saw I was legit and
[00:04:42] they were able to get to know me and then they worked with me. So it's important that your feed
[00:04:46] should not just be all personal. It's important for people to get to see some of that professional as
[00:04:51] well. So the times though, there's other times where I go to your feed and it's like all videos
[00:04:58] where you're talking to the camera or all just listed, just sold. So the times when your feed is
[00:05:06] all professional and it really doesn't have any of you, you're really missing out on bringing
[00:05:13] in clients that way. Why? So if you have all of the homes that you've listed and sold, it's great.
[00:05:18] In some ways, it's awesome. It shows that you're credible and that you're an agent who can do work
[00:05:23] and has done work. So you're making the home seller happy, you're making the buyer happy,
[00:05:28] they're seeing what you're doing the work, the actual owner of that home that you're selling feels
[00:05:32] like they're getting love and support and they're getting more eyeballs on their house. However,
[00:05:37] if everything in your feed is just listed and just sold and it's all of the home content,
[00:05:43] you're not able to elevate yourself as the go-to agent. So someone's not necessarily getting to know
[00:05:48] you, they're seeing that home, the kitchen, the backyard, great, but they're really not getting to
[00:05:53] know you in any advanced way. So the key is to merge them both. So we talk about merging them both.
[00:06:01] What does that look like? Does that look like in practice? So you have to think about what are the
[00:06:07] things that are part of my life, my personal life that I love and I could talk about all day and
[00:06:13] I am actively doing, meaning it will be hard for you to film it, that I want to bring in to my social.
[00:06:22] Now this brings us to dancing. I have two left feet. So I don't actually have two left feet. I'm
[00:06:29] okay with the little one of mine. I'm okay at dancing in a casual setting, but I despised,
[00:06:36] literally despised dance routines. So I always hated when, you know, if there was like, I remember
[00:06:41] a seventh grade play, a dance routine as a part of like a talent show or something or a sing,
[00:06:48] and you all have to remember a routine, I was always in the back row. I just can't count. So one,
[00:06:54] two, three and four. So for me, that's a very uncomfortable situation. Okay. But recently I was on
[00:07:00] a vacation with my husband and he enjoys a dance class here and there. So I said, okay, why don't we
[00:07:06] take a salsa class? Hope we need say no because I really hate dance classes. But he said yes. I knew
[00:07:12] he would find it fun. So I'm thinking in my head, okay, this is deeply uncomfortable for me.
[00:07:18] And we're doing salsa in public, in public, in a public square. I'm going to capture some
[00:07:24] content of this. Okay, so hear me out. Before we salsa danced, for my social media, one of the things
[00:07:32] that I always talk about is being uncomfortable because I teach people to be on camera, to get out
[00:07:38] of our comfort zone, right, to push yourself a little bit so that you're uncomfortable, a little
[00:07:43] bit uncomfortable because that little bit of discomfort is going to go and help you grow,
[00:07:50] right? If it's uncomfortable, it means your brain is growing. So that is one of the things I
[00:07:55] consistently talk about. So then when I'm dancing and I'm dancing not in a way that I'm loving,
[00:08:01] but in a way that's slightly uncomfortable for me, it really pulls back to my business. So when
[00:08:13] you want to pull it back to your business, so I have a good example actually. One of my realist
[00:08:20] agents, I was she's so fun. Alice, she roller skates, she roller skates and properties. I love that.
[00:08:26] So roller skating on its own could be a great part of her professional and personal content,
[00:08:30] but it's great when it's tied together. So when you're figuring out what part of your personal
[00:08:35] life to put into your social media, the ones that metaphorically are really closely tied are
[00:08:40] awesome. That's because people's brains can connect it more easily. So I'm dancing, salsa, I'm
[00:08:47] wearing like a yellowish dress. Actually, someone came over me and said, you look like the dress,
[00:08:51] you're wearing the dress and 10 things I hate about you. Or no, not 10 things I hate about you.
[00:08:56] Going with Kate Hudson. How did those guys in 10 days anyway? And so I posted it and it got a lot
[00:09:02] of engagement. And the reason why I got a lot of engagement is because people just like to see
[00:09:06] you on vacation and having fun. But also, I am clearly very focused on this dance. And I'm having
[00:09:13] fun, but I'm also it's hard. It truly is hard for me. And I wrote that in the caption that,
[00:09:18] you know, I took a salsa class. This is deeply uncomfortable. I'm practicing what I preach.
[00:09:22] For some, this is fun. It's not fun for me. And so that's the time when, even if you don't like to dance,
[00:09:29] you should dance on video. When the part of your personal life that you're bringing to social media,
[00:09:36] is aligned. So how does that work in other things? Other other other ways. I don't think there are
[00:09:41] hard and fast rules about what you shouldn't should put on. However, I think you really need to have
[00:09:48] a strategy that you live by. And so you say, when I post content, my professional content is under
[00:09:53] these buckets. And my personal content is under this bucket. When they can dovetail, amazing,
[00:10:00] fantastic, great. When they don't dovetail, it's okay, they could still exist. It's a way to bring
[00:10:06] people in. So the important part about bringing in that personal content. There is only so much
[00:10:12] professional content that people are going to respond to and engage with, right? Not everybody's
[00:10:16] going to say about that kitchen counter or about the market or about mortgage rates. So people,
[00:10:24] especially, especially, real estate agents, yeah, that's fear of influence. It comes from your
[00:10:29] friends, your colleagues, your family, your neighbor, the bagel store owner, the, you could tell I live
[00:10:34] in New York, the bagel store owner owner. But everyone you connect with. And when you're on social,
[00:10:40] they actually want to see some of your personal life. You know, people ask me how much is too personal.
[00:10:46] I think you can figure out what feels too much, what feels too personal to share. But other times,
[00:10:52] being more open and being more vulnerable generally is really great. Talking about your life,
[00:10:57] talking about your family, talking about how you got to where you got to talk about challenges in
[00:11:01] your life, that's very relatable to people. So really bringing people in on that personal level.
[00:11:06] So when you're talking about expanding your fear of influence, you want to activate all of your
[00:11:10] contacts. They're all going to be more activated by seeing you on a vacation or dancing,
[00:11:16] rather than they might not be commenting on those homes. They're still seeing those homes. So
[00:11:20] you're still able to activate that into leads and sales. But when you talk about engagement,
[00:11:26] you're going to have much more engagement by having that dancing video than just by doing
[00:11:32] all of the real estate content. So when you're thinking about dancing, I'm going to go back to dancing.
[00:11:38] If there's a dancing trend and you're funny and that's a part of you as a brand, as you're not
[00:11:43] brand as a person, that feels right for you than you should do that. But if it doesn't feel right for
[00:11:50] you, don't do it. Or look at it and say, where's the metaphor in this?
[00:11:58] Like how does this relate to being a real estate agent? To working for myself.
[00:12:04] I mean, never know, when you're a real estate agent, you're working hard. And you're always in
[00:12:07] that growth mindset. You're always learning new skills. You have to be out in the field a lot.
[00:12:11] You're really shaking a lot of hands. And so when you have experiences, you can kind of relate it
[00:12:15] to being a real estate agent, running your own business. And so just be conscious of there aren't
[00:12:20] a hard and fast rules of when to dance and when not to dance. But bringing people into your life,
[00:12:26] whether that's you doing a salsa class, whether that's you doing karaoke, whether that's what you
[00:12:31] walk in your dog, whether that's you, I don't know, I have some outdoorsy agents that work with me,
[00:12:36] whether you're on a bike ride, really make sure to connect that with people. Like have
[00:12:44] bring that onto your social. So people are like, oh, I love to ride my bike.
[00:12:48] Hey, where do you ride? That's beautiful. So people, you're going to get more engagement on things
[00:12:53] like that. And also though, next level is like, if you can tie a personal life back to your
[00:12:59] professional life, that's fantastic. And I think that that's really, really like a whole
[00:13:04] and one when we're talking about you think about those thought leaders, the go-to agents, the
[00:13:08] experts of the industry, they're really mining their personal life for those greater truths.
[00:13:15] So really looking and saying, what's happened in my life? What's happening in my life? That I'm
[00:13:20] learning from, that I'm growing from, that I'm pushing myself. And so that's where the magic comes in
[00:13:25] is when you're really mining that for those metaphors, visual metaphors too. So you're a bike rider,
[00:13:31] or let's say you like to hike, you're in a beautiful area, you look out from a little bit of the hill,
[00:13:35] maybe it's a metaphor of hiking as like being an agent. I always climb in, you don't know where
[00:13:41] the sun is, but once you get there, the air feels clear and it feels amazing. I just made that up
[00:13:47] right now, you guys. It's not kind of impressive. I'm very poetic. At your store, my mom is actually
[00:13:52] a poet. So maybe a little bit of her seeped into me. Okay, I'd love to hear questions from you.
[00:13:58] What would you like to learn about? What should I talk about next time on Keeping It Real?
[00:14:02] Make sure to connect with me. I'm on Instagram at Kim Ripperg and don't forget when you post content,

So really bringing people in on that personal level. So when you're talking about expanding your fear of influence, you want to activate all of your contacts. They're all going to be more activated by seeing you on a vacation or dancing, rather than they might not be commenting on those homes. They're still seeing those homes. So you're still able to activate that into leads and sales. But when you talk about engagement, you're going to have much more engagement by having that dancing video than just by doing all of the real estate content. So when you're thinking about dancing, I'm going to go back to dancing. If there's a dancing trend and you're funny and that's a part of you as a brand, as you're not brand as a person, that feels right for you than you should do that. But if it doesn't feel right for you, don't do it. Or look at it and say, where's the metaphor in this? Like how does this relate to being a real estate agent? To working for myself. I mean, never know, when you're a real estate agent, you're working hard. And you're always in that growth mindset. You're always learning new skills. You have to be out in the field a lot. You're really shaking a lot of hands. And so when you have experiences, you can kind of relate it to being a real estate agent, running your own business. And so just be conscious of there aren't a hard and fast rules of when to dance and when not to dance. But bringing people into your life, whether that's you doing a salsa class, whether that's you doing karaoke, whether that's what you walk in your dog, whether that's you, I don't know, I have some outdoorsy agents that work with me, whether you're on a bike ride, really make sure to connect that with people. Like have bring that onto your social. So people are like, oh, I love to ride my bike. Hey, where do you ride? That's beautiful. So people, you're going to get more engagement on things like that. And also though, next level is like, if you can tie a personal life back to your professional life, that's fantastic. And I think that that's really, really like a whole and one when we're talking about you think about those thought leaders, the go-to agents, the experts of the industry, they're really mining their personal life for those greater truths. So really looking and saying, what's happened in my life? What's happening in my life? That I'm learning from, that I'm growing from, that I'm pushing myself. And so that's where the magic comes in is when you're really mining that for those metaphors, visual metaphors too. So you're a bike rider, or let's say you like to hike, you're in a beautiful area, you look out from a little bit of the hill, maybe it's a metaphor of hiking as like being an agent. I always climb in, you don't know where the sun is, but once you get there, the air feels clear and it feels amazing. I just made that up right now, you guys. It's not kind of impressive. I'm very poetic. At your store, my mom is actually a poet. So maybe a little bit of her seeped into me. Okay, I'd love to hear questions from you. What would you like to learn about?
