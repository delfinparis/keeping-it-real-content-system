[00:01:17] Today's episode is brought to you by corded.io.
[00:01:21] Are you looking for agents to join your brokerage or team?
[00:01:24] Now, as a real estate recruiter,
[00:01:26] I can tell you the answer is always yes.
[00:01:29] But most agents aren't looking to move right now.
[00:01:31] So how do you know who to contact?
[00:01:34] Well, what if I were to tell you there's a recruiting
[00:01:35] and retention tool powered by artificial intelligence
[00:01:38] that shows you exactly which agents in your local market
[00:01:42] are looking to leave their brokerage right now
[00:01:44] and which agents at your own firm
[00:01:47] are also looking to leave you.
[00:01:49] Now, I've been recruiting REALTORS for 15 years
[00:01:52] and I've hired over 2000 agents.

[00:01:57] this is the tool I've been waiting for.
[00:01:59] Corded's AI looks for trends across dozens of variables
[00:02:02] for each agent in your market
[00:02:03] and shows you which agents they believe are likely to move.
[00:02:07] Not only does it do that, but corded's AI went
[00:02:10] and visited my recruiting website
[00:02:12] and read everything I offer.
[00:02:13] So now when I'm recruiting, corded's AI tells me
[00:02:16] exactly what to say based on that agent's needs
[00:02:20] and what my brokerage can offer.
[00:02:21] It even writes emails for me.
[00:02:23] I've never seen anything like it
[00:02:25] and I use it every single day.
[00:02:28] Now, if you are looking to grow your brokerage,

[00:02:53] Hello and welcome to another episode of Keeping It Real,
[00:02:56] the largest podcast made by real estate agents
[00:02:59] and four real estate agents.
[00:03:01] My name is DJ Paris.
[00:03:02] I am your guide and host through the show.
[00:03:04] In just a moment, we're going to be speaking
[00:03:06] with international real estate agent Maximiliano
[00:03:09] Guadalupe.
[00:03:09] 
[00:03:09] 
[00:03:09] 
[00:03:09] 
[00:03:09] 
[00:03:09] 
[00:03:10] From Argentina to talk about why Americans are investing there
[00:03:14] and what you need to know as an agent to help work
[00:03:17] with those clients.
[00:03:18] Very exciting, a little bit of a different topic for us today.
[00:03:22] So super excited to talk chat with Max in just a moment.
[00:03:25] And as always, thank you for checking out our podcasts.
[00:03:27] We appreciate you.
[00:03:28] We love your feedback.
[00:03:30] Let us know what you like about the show,
[00:03:32] what you'd like us to improve or change.
[00:03:34] Leave us a review.
[00:03:35] Whatever podcast app you might be listening
[00:03:36] or watching us on, please let us know what you like.
[00:03:39] If you think of the show, it helps us out a lot
[00:03:41] and gets us more exposure.
[00:03:43] And also, please tell a friend, think of one other agent
[00:03:45] that could benefit from hearing from top producers
[00:03:47] about how they built their business.
[00:03:49] All right, guys, let's get to it.
[00:03:51] My conversation with Maximiliano Guadalupe.
[00:04:06] Okay, today on this show, we have Maximiliano Guards
[00:04:11] from MGNI in Argentina.
[00:04:14] Let me tell you more about Max.
[00:04:16] Now, Maximiliano Guards is a seasoned professional
[00:04:19] with over 25 years of real estate and management experience.
[00:04:23] He operates the M. Guards,
[00:04:25] Nugosios in M.O.
[00:04:27] Bolarios, which is M.G.N.I,
[00:04:29] which serves the city of Buenos Aires in Argentina
[00:04:32] and the province of Buenos Aires,
[00:04:34] and is a member of the National Association of REALTORS.
[00:04:37] Guards attended Lincoln School in La Lusia
[00:04:41] for his elementary through high school education.
[00:04:46] So his American grandparents and mother played a crucial role
[00:04:48] in his ability to handle English-speaking clients,
[00:04:51] relations effectively.
[00:04:53] He pursued higher education at university, university,
[00:04:57] a del Salvador, and university,
[00:04:59] Nashino, Dula, Matanza, my apologies,
[00:05:03] I do not speak Spanish, so I'm doing my very very best.
[00:05:06] But M.G.N.I, his firm offers a range of services,
[00:05:09] including real estate transactions, property management,
[00:05:12] appraisals, and consultancy for both local and international clients.
[00:05:16] The reason that we're bringing Max on the show today
[00:05:19] is that we don't ever talk on the show
[00:05:23] about international investments outside of the U.S.
[00:05:26] And we figured, you know,
[00:05:27] with things being the way they are right now
[00:05:29] with U.S. real estate, in particular,
[00:05:32] with the NAR settlement that's obviously changed some things
[00:05:35] for buyers and sellers here in our market.
[00:05:37] That perhaps it would be a good idea to also introduce the idea
[00:05:41] of course, outside investments,
[00:05:42] and certainly people are doing that.
[00:05:44] And seven years on the show,
[00:05:46] and I haven't really ever had this conversation.
[00:05:47] So I'm so excited to bring on Max.
[00:05:50] Please visit Max on his website.
[00:05:52] And I'm going to spell it for you.
[00:05:53] It's m-g-o-t-z.com.
[00:05:56] Sorry, m-g-o-t-z.com.
[00:05:59] We have a link to that in the show notes as well.
[00:06:01] Max, welcome to the show.
[00:06:04] Thank you so much for having me, DJ.
[00:06:05] It's a thrill. Thank you.
[00:06:07] It's a thrill for me as well.
[00:06:09] I was telling, I was asking Max just to talk to the listeners for a second.
[00:06:14] Just before he came on, you'll notice Max does sound like he is not
[00:06:19] from Argentina, at least what I would assume.
[00:06:21] Somebody from Argentina born and raised it would sound like what he is.
[00:06:25] And we talked, you know, in his, in the little intro there,
[00:06:29] we talked about how he, you know, studied English, of course, growing up.
[00:06:33] But it is truly incredible.
[00:06:35] I, you, you probably have less of an accent, American accent than I do.
[00:06:39] But, but you have really, really, it's amazing that you've spent your whole life there.
[00:06:44] But how did you, how, you know, how did you, obviously, you were born there?
[00:06:47] How did your parents get to, to Argentina?
[00:06:50] Well, they, they had the foresight, my, my, my mother, who actually lived in the United States,
[00:06:56] and my grandparents who were New Yorkers.
[00:06:59] My grandparents would come and go to Argentina, and then they settled here for a number of years.
[00:07:05] And then they went back to the States and eventually retired in Florida.
[00:07:08] But my, my grandparents, my, my mother's parents,
[00:07:11] and my mother had kind of the foresight to K through 12,
[00:07:16] put me into the international school of which, you know, all, all capitals have one of these,
[00:07:21] were all the ex-fed kids and military kids, all these guys go to.
[00:07:25] And so, added to the fact that my mother, an English professor,
[00:07:30] my grandmother was also an English educator, and also from the United States.
[00:07:35] So you can imagine English was heavily spoken, not just at home, but obviously at school.
[00:07:40] Plus the fact that I would, during our winters and your summers,
[00:07:44] I would fly up to the States and spend two or three months at a time.
[00:07:48] So the language, the, the formality of the language was quickly added to all the nuance and the colloquialism
[00:07:55] and, and all that kind of fun stuff.
[00:07:57] And I guess to a degree, the fact that I love it, as much as I do, you know, the, the language and the meanings and stuff like that,
[00:08:03] I guess that also helped, you know, because like when you like something, it comes a bit easier.
[00:08:09] Absolutely. Well, it's incredible. I suspect you probably even meet people, you know, local natives in, in Buenos Aires,
[00:08:18] who probably go, oh, I didn't, wouldn't assume that you were born and raised here as well.
[00:08:22] I've been, I've been told I sound like someone who is from New York a lot,
[00:08:27] someone who's from Kansas, which was the first couple of years ago.
[00:08:31] And then one guy told me I sounded like Jeff Goldblum. So I've been trying to protect that too.
[00:08:34] You do have a little bit of Jeff Goldblum. I love it. I love it. Well, let's talk about real estate in Argentina.
[00:08:42] So first of all, how did you get into the real estate industry down there?
[00:08:46] Well, I started one of my very first jobs as cliche as the sounds was in real estate for a number of months.
[00:08:53] And then I moved on to other things and eventually went to university.
[00:08:58] But I kind of liked it and I liked the fact that it involved working with people.
[00:09:03] I was in law school for a number of years and it wasn't my thing. I did not enjoy it.
[00:09:11] So right around the time of being either second or third year law school student,
[00:09:17] a friend of a friend had a foreign couple that needed help managing a property that they had here in Buenos Aires.
[00:09:25] So I took that as a kind of a odd job and we managed it and we did the pre-earb and B thing, which is VRBO.
[00:09:32] Sure.
[00:09:33] Parentals, which was at the time pretty big here, exploding.
[00:09:37] So we started with managing that property and that in a good way sort of snowballed into two apartments, four apartments, ten apartments.
[00:09:44] And I said, well, you know, gosh, I'm going to kind of professionalize this and make a make a website and make a this and make that.
[00:09:50] Once it became a kind of a fixed nine to five or actually Monday to Monday job where we also added city tours and concierge services.
[00:10:03] That plus the fact that I wasn't having any fun at school, I sort of began doing that altogether, just that branch of real estate.
[00:10:11] And over time, what happened was a lot of people wanted to buy foreigners would come down and say, wow, you know, I love my stay here and I would really like to consider working or buying something here.
[00:10:25] So that over time, I because I wasn't licensed at the time, I had to send my clients across the street to someone who was licensed and then in the hopes of getting a commission from them.
[00:10:37] So that prompted me to go back to school and become a REALTOR, which in Argentina is a is a three year college course. It's not a wow.
[00:10:49] Yeah, yeah, it's a college course.
[00:10:51] But essentially, that's what had happened.
[00:10:54] And one of my one of my favorite stories is that early on, we had a guy from Southern California, who to this day is a client and a very kind of, you know,
[00:11:08] agreeable single guy who travels the world, he said, look, I'd like to take you out to dinner and learn more about buying real estate. So we went out to dinner as a business dinner.
[00:11:17] And we hit it off. And at one point, the conversation for for whatever reason, something reminded me of a scenario from the TV show, Seinfeld, which I know for you guys was massively popular.
[00:11:30] And I'm a huge fan. And this guy happened to be probably right up there as big a fan as I am. And so that immediately shifted the conversation from, here's how you buy here.
[00:11:41] And what you do, what you don't do to remember the episode when remember the episode when.
[00:11:47] And so from there, the restaurant was closing. We went for a couple of years. We continued to talk about that cut to 17 years later, the guy is still a client.
[00:11:55] We manage his property. And we're still talking about the same, you know, silliness.
[00:12:00] So, you know, you just the business just goes forward organically, however it will. But it kind of in a way found me because it mixed things that I like, which is working with people working with foreigners with whom I kind of have a rapport, especially US and Canada, because that's kind of the culture that I was surrounded by.
[00:12:24] And so, yeah, I went back to college. I did the, you know, I majored as we're about to course credits for that. And, and, you know, started up and formalized it even more.
[00:12:39] Well, thank you. Tell us a little bit about the real estate market in Argentina. Sort of what are you currently experiencing there? And where do you see opportunities? Maybe even challenges.
[00:12:52] Yeah, well, to answer your question directly, we are now in what could best be described the 50 or 60 or maybe even of a buyer's market. It's been a buyer's market for a long time.
[00:13:06] And I do think we've already hit rock bottom, although we're not far above rock bottom.
[00:13:13] And for those who may not know this, and there's no reason why you would know this. But when a site is presents the ability to buy a real estate at prices, which are fantastic when you compare them to other world class cities in New York, you know, I don't know, Berlin, London, Paris,
[00:13:32] and Paris, at a fraction of the cost really. And with some of the most beautiful architecture, you will find.
[00:13:40] And a very Latin ambiance because, you know, we have this, this, it's like New York, it's a melting pot. And our forefathers are the Spanish and the Italian and to a lesser degree, the Germans and the Austrians and so forth.
[00:13:55] We have the eighth largest Jewish population here. And it's also worth noting that Argentina is the eighth largest geography in the world.
[00:14:08] So it's got one of the largest deposits of potable water, lithium. So there's a lot of business to be had.
[00:14:18] And so that if the right government runs the country, which we could circle back to that.
[00:14:23] But you've also got everything you need in the way of tourism, you've got desert, you've got the US who falls, which are one of the UNESCO heritage sites around the world.
[00:14:32] You've got beach, you've got skiing, you've got the glaciers down south. So there's a little bit for everyone.
[00:14:37] And I would argue maybe the best food in South America or certainly certainly of the best food, maybe prove it might might might think, you know, every country thinks they probably have the best food.
[00:14:51] But Argentina is one of the one of the South American countries that makes its way up here. We have Argentinian stakeholders here in Chicago, New York, bigger cities have them.
[00:15:01] I don't see a lot from other South American countries.
[00:15:07] The beef to be sure, I don't know about the food as a general. I love our local food. I also love, you know, I love I love food in the US. I love food here.
[00:15:17] It's all it's all got its things. But the beef here is I would like to be objective in saying I think it is second to none.
[00:15:25] But yes, we have we have very good beef. We have very good produce.
[00:15:31] And the yes, the real estate market is undergoing still what you would call a buyers market.
[00:15:37] And we have seen more. In fact, our niche has become over the years, the foreign investor and assisting them in the process of either buying real estate or selling real estate.
[00:15:49] They already own it from before or everything in the middle management or consultancy or whatever. Now, I'm going to tell you one thing, which is possibly the biggest cultural shock that you will come to find about real estate or Argentina.
[00:16:05] And it is that transactions are are done 90% of the time. If not more cash on the barrel head.
[00:16:12] And what I mean by that is you come with the money you laid on the table. The money is counted and the deed is signed. Okay, here's your money. Here's your keys. Thanks for, you know, thanks for everything and the notary witnesses and that's that we do not have 20 year mortgages financing is very hard to come by for locals never mind foreigners.
[00:16:40] So in order to buy real estate. Most of the time you need to have the cash much like, you know, a clonese movie where the guy comes in with the dollar satchels and plops them on the table.
[00:16:52] You come in with a cash. And that's just the way it's worked for many, many years and you know, we're hoping to be able to join the 21st century and and come up with other more pragmatic and safer solutions.
[00:17:04] But for in the meantime, that's how it's that's how the final leg of it is done with cash.
[00:17:10] And how has the rental market been you mentioned VRBO being the the leader in that sort of space and the in the short term rental space or the online short term rental space, certainly for people visiting.
[00:17:23] And now of course Airbnb probably taking taking the lead on that or maybe they're battling it out depends on I guess which country.
[00:17:32] But how is the I know to I guess we're talking about tourism. So I know tourism was huge pre COVID obviously COVID changed everything for every country, not not necessarily Argentina.
[00:17:45] But you know, there was there was a huge drop off in tourism, you know, once COVID hit obviously now things are back to relative normalcy have you seen an increase in uptick in, you know, Americans coming down there people from other countries obviously visiting.
[00:18:01] How is how is the tourism been.
[00:18:04] Well, yeah, tour, well, here's what's interesting during COVID our office saw a huge influx of work and it's incredible because obviously many real stifler arms had to shut down had to stop working really because they depend on on sales and rentals and a lot of stuff had shut down.
[00:18:22] And it was you were kind of adding insult to injury there because the Argentine economy was already not in a good place is in bad shape.
[00:18:31] So this was like a like a, you know, an elderly patient who gets a virus in the hospital versus a young healthy patient. So we were already kind of, you know, not doing great.
[00:18:43] Now, this is very interesting what happened was COVID hit pandemic hit everything was shut down and a whole lot of people that were scheduled to leave were suddenly stuck in Argentina.
[00:18:58] So they needed housing right away many of those people were kind of, you know, flirting with the idea of buying something they were forced to pull the trigger but many more needed long term housing.
[00:19:12] So all of a sudden a barrage of people would contact us about I need a place I can't leave and many other people who were getting during the first few months where people would get I don't know about the rest of the world, but here you would get special permits to fly into Argentina.
[00:19:27] If you were a foreigner because my wife is Argentine or I'm about to be married or my child is about to be born. We had a lot of that. So we had to help people find a home solution. So there was that.
[00:19:42] And it yeah, we we saw quite a few people who who I mean again work kind of really, really blew up, which was strange, you know tourism tourist tourist or tour agencies had to pretty much shut down.
[00:19:59] They had no money coming in, but some real estate firms are at least hours. We saw quite a bit of work. Now yeah, you're right tourism prior to that was doing really well. And once COVID sort of ended, it blew up again.
[00:20:13] I think we've been getting records of amount of people coming into Argentina. The dollar still gets you a very long way, even though Argentina has an endemic inflation problem 243% in or annual last time.
[00:20:28] And you know, we came out this month for foreigners to say for you coming down in US dollars, it's still kind of a deal. There are things you will find to be more expensive and there are things you'll find to be dirt cheap.
[00:20:41] But you will all of that, I think to a degree, takes a back seat to the fact that people just feel like they are, they fall in love with with not just Buenos Aires, but generally speaking what they go out and and do in in in Argentina.
[00:20:56] And yes, the Airbnb tool, which we use, became increasingly popular among people here so much so that this was sometimes after VRB, although it happened with VRB as well.
[00:21:11] But hotels started to heavily lobby Congress for added taxes or for like a kind of a list where people would jot down their names and say, okay, look, I'm renting through Airbnb and so forth.
[00:21:25] This being Argentina, this being a Latin mindset, not a whole many people wrote themselves down at that, you know, Gestapo list that the government wanted us to sign up for or not us, but the owners.
[00:21:38] But hotels were having a bad time at it because they could no longer charge whatever they wanted all of a sudden they had this, this kind of a new layer.
[00:21:45] The markets dictating a different, different price.
[00:21:47] Yeah, yeah. But Airbnb operates illegally, legally, and we haven't had that situation that you guys have had in New York in the few other cities where it's kind of all but banned.
[00:22:00] So we do see it there. We do see it here. And it's it's very, very much used. And you know, again, our office uses it as a tool.
[00:22:10] I would say it represents about of our vacation or short-term rental leg of business, a good 20 or 25% of what comes in. So, you know, needless to say, it's it's pretty, it's pretty important.
[00:22:23] So if I was, if I am a REALTOR here in the US and I have investor clients who are cash heavy, who are looking for either.
[00:22:34] So I guess there's two types, well, there's more than two types of investors, but the two types that are coming to mind at the moment is the second vacation home or I vacation home, maybe down in Argentina where I visited, I love it, I want to return and rent it out, maybe, you know, higher you would have managed it along the way.
[00:22:52] When I'm not there, let's let's keep it full. Or maybe people who of course just want to keep it empty for the higher net worth individuals, maybe who just need a second place.
[00:23:02] And then of course the more sort of the investor who is really just looking for a cash return on their investment.
[00:23:13] So what would you say to them as far as why they should consider. And again, there's three different buckets there, but I know I'm asking kind of a complicated question, but let's tackle one at a time.
[00:23:23] So for the for the for the person who visits Argentina, falls in love like my sister did last year when she visited and I sadly was unable to accompany her and my brother-in-law and my net my six my seven year old nephew has been to Argentina and I have not and I am I'm angry about this.
[00:23:40] But I mean, I'm not really angry, but I find it so funny that a seven year old made it there before I did, but they fell in love with it. They came back. They're like, you have to go. So now they're giving me grief that I have to go. But what would you say to somebody who, you know, why should they consider, you know, a long term investment there?
[00:24:00] Yeah, well, first of all, I completely agree. I think you hit the nail on the head. The two I would say main investment groups are those two. And by the way, they're not necessarily mutually exclusive.
[00:24:11] But the guy that falls in love to be sure wants a second home to be sure. But the second group, which I find to be the most interesting group is the guy that is playing the capital gains gain.
[00:24:21] You know, he's going to buy something at a down market, which of its own you can get something which would otherwise cost you a New York City.
[00:24:30] $600,000, maybe here for $120,000. And I mean, a one bedroom in a good area with a view, so for the so on. And I'm just comparing New York as it's the only market that I kind of tangentially know about and even.
[00:24:44] But I would say, yeah, you, you would, you know, just what our grandparents taught us you by low and you sell high, you keep it over time.
[00:24:54] Do not expect to make a short term ROI. Do not sell to a client that you are going to buy, put it nice and premium proper, put it on the market and start getting $3,000 a month clean from your rental.
[00:25:09] So for many reasons, not the least of which is there is a large supply of real estate being offered for short term rentals.
[00:25:20] And also because of the fact that you, you know, while it is yes, inexpensive city. And given the fact that there's so much supply, you can't ask whatever you want.
[00:25:30] You might have the most beautiful three bedroom penthouse unit overlooking the river and so forth. But if you put it at a price, which people do not want to pay, they're not going to pay.
[00:25:42] And our client base, which as I said is predominantly the North American client base, you know, you guys are pretty savvy. You guys shop around you guys have a culture of knowing the value of your currency.
[00:25:54] So while there are people who will try to overcharge, I think the season tourist or even not season tourist knows how to shop around for pricing.
[00:26:07] So again, I think I think we were talking about earlier, but if you were to take a pie chart of why would someone buy an Argentina and want someone from Chicago, you might say, yes, okay.
[00:26:18] The investment game of buying low or buying low selling high, the fact that, you know, I have a second home, I can make some money off of it. I can air be and be it out and then during the winter months, all escape Chicago and I'll come down for a month or whatever.
[00:26:33] Nowadays, you've got the digital nomad things. But in that pie chart, I can tell you in my conversations over and over and over again, it's the fact that, man, I love it here.
[00:26:45] Man, the lack of nature of things, the fact that it's not as, you know, buttoned up as in the US or Canada or pockets of Europe, the fact that it's also Lucy Kusie.
[00:26:57] It's a common denominator in my conversations with people. And that would make a good 20 or 25% of that of that pie chart. I tell you, it's just one of those things. Or they say, look, I didn't know what to expect. And I just, I love it. I just love it here.
[00:27:12] I remember visiting Nicaragua probably 10 years ago on a vacation and ended up so Central America ended up, I can't remember the, gosh, the city's escaping me at the moment. But I think it's San Juan. Anyway, it doesn't matter.
[00:27:30] Anyway, we ended up at this surfing area in Nicaragua, very famous, apparently. And we were staying at this echolage, this really kind of cool place that with other Americans who were staying there.
[00:27:46] And one of them was actually they were Australians and they were going to invest in and build a condo or build some sort of home on the beach.
[00:27:54] And it was really exciting and cool to hear their story. And then I thought, hmm, well, Nicaragua again, not comparing Nicaragua and Argentina, but just sort of a foreign investment idea.
[00:28:04] It was like, wasn't Nicaragua somewhat unstable at some point government unstable. I know they had their share of issues years and years ago. But I said, you know, did that factor into your decision as far as the stability of the economy, the stability of the political system there and who's running things, of course.
[00:28:23] And they said, yeah, but they were confident that they felt, you know, the government was competent and not was wasn't going to be overthrown.
[00:28:30] Does that come up in conversations with investors about this sort of what's going on in Argentina? And I'm not suggesting there's anything to be concerned about, but just we just don't know.
[00:28:40] Yeah, no, no, well, well, first of all, you had you don't have to but pick up a newspaper and read what's going on in Argentina, but Argentina does have has had and continues to have its share of economic crises.
[00:28:55] As I said, inflation is probably top most on the list recession corrupt governments things with that nature.
[00:29:02] Now, the wonderful thing though is and I like to tell my foreign clients this, you know, let's say DJ you fly down you buy something you get the best of both worlds and why do I say that because you're able to enjoy all the great things that the country has to offer without having to put up with the BS that it also has to offer.
[00:29:20] You know, one guy once asked me, hey, you guys have any, you know, you have hurricanes or earth we're getting natural. No, no, no, we don't have any of that. Thankfully, we just have government.
[00:29:29] So, you know, we are only as good as the people who govern us are and I think thankfully these last elections have kind of, you know, there's been some wins of change in that regard and I think we're moving towards a different and much better place.
[00:29:45] But people do ask us that and the great thing is I can speak to other countries where in Latin America or in the Americas where something like that would affect a foreign investor.
[00:29:58] There are stories about Costa Rica, Brazil, even Canada has certain laws and bylaws that you cannot buy as an American unless Argentina, thankfully has nothing like that.
[00:30:11] The owning property in Argentina is the process of getting from A to Z to be sure is complex and we do hand holding and that's kind of where we, I think, stand apart and I think what we like most about our job, which is explaining, okay, now this is going to happen and now this is going to happen. Now that's good.
[00:30:32] But the reality is once it's all said and done, there is a notary public, which is not to be confused with how you guys have notaries in the United States and they have a rubber stamp at kinkos.
[00:30:44] Here, a notary public is necessarily a lawyer and it's very, very hard to become a notary public and he is the person who is in charge of not just signing and witnessing and stamping, but also he is in charge of the due diligence, which includes,
[00:31:01] but is limited to title study insurance. He's the guy who will say, look, gentlemen, this cannot be signed because it appears that there is a lien on this property from the seller or it appears that there is an embargo on that person's salary or whatever.
[00:31:20] So once all that's been completed and the due diligence done and everything is okay and you DJ sign as the buyer, that's the end of it.
[00:31:30] No one can come out of the woodwork and say, hey, look, I'm the long lost sign of the seller. I didn't approve this. No, you're not because you know, this is, we did all the due diligence, we did all our homework and here's the deed, which by the way, it comes in a special sheet of paper with a number and then sent to the county registrar's office, recorded, comes back and given to you.
[00:31:50] And that's it. It's yours. Squatters rights, expropriation, anything. Expropriation to be fair does exist in Argentina as it does in any country. But as we know, it has to do with taking the property or group of properties for the greater good, like a highway, like that kind of thing.
[00:32:10] But you don't really hardly ever see that at all. So to your question, sorry, I kind of went off the reservation, but no, you don't, it doesn't, it doesn't affect if anything, if anything, you know, when there are economic woes and a buyer's market presented self, that's when, I mean, you know, you're preaching to the choir, I guess here, but that's kind of when you strike, right, when the iron is hot.
[00:32:36] Sure. It's interesting. I looked up because I was curious, I don't, I don't usually hear Argentina in the news with respect to unrest.
[00:32:47] They don't usually participate in a lot of outside war or even internal war. And so I was on Wikipedia, I go, wonder when the last time Argentina's had a real serious sort of arms conflict.
[00:33:01] And, and 1994, which was during, basically, the, the, well, actually, I take it back. Yeah, 1994 was kind of the last time that I found in it. I'm not even sure it was called Operation Talos. But anyway, that's the last time on Wikipedia that there was any sort of, you know, acknowledgement of, you know, any sort of movement within within the, within the country or with their participation outside or people, you know, invading or coming in.
[00:33:30] So it seems to be a very stable and safe country. I mean, certainly the United States has had plenty of conflicts since 1994.
[00:33:38] Yeah, I mean, it's an interesting, it's an interesting perspective.
[00:33:43] I would agree, wholeheartedly, stable, it depends on your definition. It is a democratically stable country for sure. And because of the fact that we had military dictatorships for a number of years, the last of which was extremely bloody.
[00:33:59] And, and, you know, most people know about the fact that, you know, people disappeared and, and so forth. They made a point of protecting democracy in a very, very big way. So democracy returned to Argentina in 1983.
[00:34:16] And yeah, I would say that from a democratic standpoint, Argentina is like the US. It's a federal democracy. And so a federal republic. And so, yeah, we've made a point of making it, I think, well, we, you know, country has made a point of having to be safe.
[00:34:33] Now, stable, it depends on how you define stable economically, ish, fiscally ish. But we, I think we are certainly trying to better ourselves in that regard.
[00:34:49] But there again, the investing of real estate does not see itself affected by whatever fiscal instability there might be. You're going to buy real estate, and it's going to be there. And you can do with it whatever you want.
[00:35:03] Now, if you, DJ, as a Chicago native, want to come to Argentina and start an import export business, or you want to open a restaurant, or you want to open any other type of business, that's going to require a lot more due diligence because those kinds of things will see themselves affected more, more noticeably on the day to day.
[00:35:26] You're going to have employees. You're going to have taxes to be paid. You're, excuse me. But with real estate, it's something that you buy, and it's a degree to wish it's a one off so much so that you can say, I got the set of killing. I'm going to just leave it there, have someone pay for the taxes, water the plants. I'm going to wait 10 years. And then I'll sell it when the market turns people have done that.
[00:35:48] Yeah, and also, too, we should just mention, and this is something that just my ignorance of geography up until probably a few years ago, certainly in South America, my knowledge of where the countries are all positioned is not is embarrassingly poor.
[00:36:02] But Argentina is also how we oftentimes get to Antarctica, right? For Antarctica tours, I know there are ways to get there from Argentina. So this also become, I mean, Argentina just was really a very versatile country. There's a lot that you could do there as a tourist. There's a lot of places you can go, I have friends that have gone and done, you know, marathon's down in Antarctica or some sort of, you know, I don't know if it was, you know, an Iron Man triad.
[00:36:33] Yeah, we have. We've had those, yeah, yeah. Yeah. And no, it's all typically go right into Argentina on the way. Yeah, no, you're right. Argentina is the tours to Antarctica start here. You fly down to one of the southern most provinces. I think from there, you fly over to E. La Marvina, which is otherwise known as Falcland Islands to many. And then you go to Antarctica. And the people that I know that I've done that, they swoon over it. They say it's fantastic. And I have heard more than once.
[00:37:02] I think it's because of the fact that they are eventually going to try to do away with that because of what it's doing to the environment over a course of decades. I don't know, I don't know if that's for not.
[00:37:11] But yeah, to your point, Argentina has it. And a lot of people, especially my European clients, don't quite capture the massive nature of the country. And they say, you know, I'm going for five days. I'd like to see the falls and the beach and the glacier.
[00:37:29] And these are people who walk five blocks and are in a different country, not so much here. You got to take a flight to say the E. Guasu Falls, which is two hours.
[00:37:40] You got to fly down to where the glaciers are, which is like three hours. But to be sure, we do have it all. We've got mountain, we've got skiing, we've got beach, we've got the E. Guasu Falls.
[00:37:51] The city of B.A. alone has some of the most beautiful architecture you'll see. We've got, I think, one of the, it was in a list somewhere, one of the either biggest or most beautiful bookstores, which used to be a theater house.
[00:38:07] We have a lot of those, you know, biggest or best of or whatever. The river that separates Argentina with Uruguay is the biggest, is the widest river in the world, although technically it's not really a river. It's an estuary, but I digress.
[00:38:23] But it's, you know, there's, yeah, you're right. There's, there's lots to do. Just the city of B.A. alone.
[00:38:30] There's plenty to do.
[00:38:32] And, you know, with tourism, return, we're having returned and I don't anticipate any sign of that slowing other than being some sort of, you know, calamity like we had with COVID.
[00:38:43] This is a place where people will return to time and time again. So from an investment perspective, you know, unless something changes and the government, you know, for whatever reason becomes unfriendly to tourism, which I'm sure will not be the case, because it's such a big driver for the economy is going to be a pretty stable investment.
[00:39:03] It sounds like at least in the idea of getting tourists there and, you know, enjoying what Argentina has to offer.
[00:39:11] Yeah, well, this, this new government, which is by all accounts, what you might characterize as a libertarian government, very, very much to the right.
[00:39:20] In fact, this president, who has also been on a, on everybody's lips of late, is the first Argentine president to be an economist, which is, if you think about it, it's a huge deal, especially in a country that has suffered inflation for decades.
[00:39:38] In fact, we are of the few countries along around the world that has not stomped out inflation. It's, you know, everyone else is kind of, yeah, you guys are now having this, this kind of pick up of it again and so forth, but really inflation has been all but,
[00:39:52] but, you know, we've had lawyers, a lot of lawyers, we've had one dentist, one MD, and of course, military, military core presence, but I think that opening up the floodgates of foreign investment certainly peaks the interest of the world, we think.
[00:40:20] Well, well, it's really a great opportunity. So if I, if I'm a REALTOR here and either I'm interested in exploring, bring this to my clients who maybe are high net worth clients who want maybe a second home, where they either let it sit or rent it while they're not there, or maybe investor, maybe even institutional investor, who is, you know, looking for, you know, good cash flow.
[00:40:47] So what's really the best way someone could start to sort of get a hold of what's how it works down there and how they should present it to their clients.
[00:41:00] Well, I mean, to be sure information is key and in this age of the internet and everything else, information certainly is online. There's a lot of it, which is faulty and there's a lot of it, which is an exact, but there's a lot of it, which is, which at least gives you a starting point.
[00:41:17] And in our case, we made it a point to be members of the REALTORS Association up in the state so that we could have a foothold and if anybody needed something, our name was there and, you know, they could reach out to us in English, no less. So there would be nothing lost in translation.
[00:41:35] Also members of, for example, the Argentine at Texas Chamber of Commerce.
[00:41:41] And again, in our case, we set up these webinars and we even, I even wrote a couple of ebooks that detail what the process is and gives people a primer of what to do and what to know and what to expect.
[00:41:56] And then from there, people really need only Google real estate firms in Argentina and find out which ones are good, which ones are not or actually, you know, determine themselves, which ones are good, which ones are bad and take it from there.
[00:42:10] But reading up on it, maybe calling the NAR, maybe also reaching out to REALTORS, you know, Argentina forums, you know, forums are also great for that online forums.
[00:42:25] Now that I'm thinking about it, I have a friend because at National Association REALTORS is headquartered here in Chicago, one of my good friends who is a Chicago and is really native to the Philippines.
[00:42:37] And she is the ambassador, or I'm not sure exactly what the title is, but all call her ambassador for NAR to the Philippines. And so she represents NAR visits Philippines and sort of, you know, is always passing information back and forth.
[00:42:52] I suspect there is one as well with NAR for Argentina. And yeah, and so that's another option too is to call NAR and say, hey, I would like to learn a little bit more about Argentina as there's someone I can connect with.
[00:43:05] Usually the way that NAR works is they will find someone who is natively born, oftentimes natively born in that country, who really understands the customs and culture and the politics and the financial, the fiscal sort of policies.
[00:43:19] And then sort of as that person becomes a resource to other REALTORS as well as yourself.
[00:43:24] Well, NAR, as you probably know, they have a collection of courses that they offer us. And I did the, what is it the CIPS, the Certified International Property Specialist one.
[00:43:38] And I was, which was very enlightening in terms of how REALTOR works in other American countries, come to find Argentina wasn't in the course.
[00:43:47] So I did the course. I reached out and said, hey, I recently completed this list. And I'd like to throw my hand in the ring to create the chapter of Argentina and add it there because you guys don't have Argentina and you can't not have Argentina.
[00:44:04] So that's in the works. I guess I have to talk to him again now that I think about it. But that would be potentially one way in which the word could be, could be made to come out and that.
[00:44:18] But I do think that the number one way that it's that is word of mouth and it's people saying, hey, I was recently an Argentine or, hey, my brother and I was an Argentine.
[00:44:27] Well, you know, go no further. You're saying to me that your sister in law came back and said, yep, you got to go. You got to go.
[00:44:33] So so that happens a lot and and people seem to to really like it. The word of mouth, I think, is is. And again, this day these days with internet, you can find out anything.
[00:44:45] Sure. And then you got to get the right tools and the right people and take it from there.
[00:44:51] Well, if anyone would be interested in maybe reviewing some of your your ebooks around sort of priming oneself to sort of get started understanding what the real estate sort of process is down in Argentina, the investment process.
[00:45:07] What's the best way that they should reach out to you?
[00:45:10] Well, I think the best way to reach out to us is just through our website.
[00:45:14] We're on social media and things of that nature. And if they just want to reach out via email or WhatsApp or we also have a US number.
[00:45:24] We have like a like a pre fab text file that we send them.
[00:45:28] And they don't even have to subscribe or click here to subscribe and get spam mail.
[00:45:33] All they need to do is reach out and say, hey, you know, I read about you or heard about you. I'd like to learn more.
[00:45:39] And we were applied to them with a series of links, the two or three ebooks that we wrote.
[00:45:47] The webinar that we were that was hosted by the Argentina Texas Chamber of Commerce. And then just for yucks, we were in an episode of House Hunters International.
[00:45:55] So we send that link along too.
[00:45:59] And again, it doesn't come with any need for them to subscribe or anything like that. They're not going to get hit with emails.
[00:46:06] They're just going to get replied to when they reach out to us.
[00:46:10] So, but yeah, through the website, which I think you said the domain, what that was or you might add it later, but they can just reach out to us through there.
[00:46:19] And that domain is M G O T Z M technically m grits dot com, but we're going to say it the way it's spelled M M gots M G O T Z dot com is where you can learn about all things max as well as his firm.
[00:46:36] And what he offers when with respect to not only management of real estate assets, but of course helping people find and procure and also run or get deals closed, of course, in foreign land.
[00:46:50] So max, thank you so much.
[00:46:53] So anyone out there who has who works with investors, who has investors that are looking for, you know, maybe outside investments to the US or want a second home.
[00:47:04] This is a great opportunity. And I know for sure Argentina is on my list now. Well, it's a bit on my list to go visit.
[00:47:13] I still have to still have to do Peru as well. My brother-in-law is Peruvian and I have yet to to to make it down there.
[00:47:20] But I will do them both in one trip and that would be that would be an amazing trip.
[00:47:29] But anyway, if anyone out there is interested in learning more M G O T Z dot com is where you go reach out to max. Let them know you heard him on the show and on behalf of our audience.
[00:47:39] So max, thank you so much. This was really educational for me and for the audience really understanding that hey, you know, real estate is yes hyper local for the markets we serve.
[00:47:50] But of course there's other markets outside of not just our local market, but of course even our country that we want to consider as real estate agents.
[00:47:57] You know, we have a fiduciary responsibility as REALTORS to our clients and one of those is, you know, becoming educated on good up fiduciary opportunities for clients.
[00:48:08] So this is one to consider. Certainly Argentina is the reputation of tourism to us love it. I have yet to meet somebody who didn't enjoy visiting Argentina.
[00:48:19] It's kind of like there's there's some countries that are like that Italy's like that people you know you never heard anybody say I went to Italy and that just wasn't.
[00:48:27] I didn't like it. Yeah, that's true. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Argentina.
[00:48:31] Yeah, Argentina has that same exact sort of reputation and there's a reason for that and you know the culture, the scenery, the architecture, the people as well as the food.
[00:48:45] And so please consider doing that and reaching out and learning about it and let Max know again MGOTZ.com is the website to learn about all things Argentina.
[00:48:56] And Max on behalf of our audience, thank you for coming on our show love having somebody from from the Southern hemisphere on our show.
[00:49:04] And so it's not very often we get to do that. And although you sound just like me so it sounds like it seems like we're in the same room.
[00:49:11] But we are very far away, but I am excited to to plan my trip down there with with with my girlfriend and hopefully make it there maybe even next year. We'll give it a shot. I'll talk to her tonight about it.
[00:49:21] But on behalf of our audience, thank you Max on behalf of Max. Thank you to our audience for sticking around until the end. We appreciate you. Please tell another REALTOR about this show.
[00:49:31] That's the best way you can continue to help us grow. We've got all done almost 600 episodes now. We're one of the most listened to shows.
[00:49:38] Actually, we believe we're the most listened to show for REALTORS in the country. Help us continue to grow. Thank you for that.

Now, as a real estate recruiter, I can tell you the answer is always yes. But most agents aren't looking to move right now. So how do you know who to contact? Well, what if I were to tell you there's a recruiting and retention tool powered by artificial intelligence that shows you exactly which agents in your local market are looking to leave their brokerage right now and which agents at your own firm are also looking to leave you. Now, I've been recruiting REALTORS for 15 years and I've hired over 2000 agents. I can tell you with no exaggeration, this is the tool I've been waiting for. Corded's AI looks for trends across dozens of variables for each agent in your market and shows you which agents they believe are likely to move.

And also, please tell a friend, think of one other agent that could benefit from hearing from top producers about how they built their business. All right, guys, let's get to it. My conversation with Maximiliano Guadalupe. Okay, today on this show, we have Maximiliano Guards from MGNI in Argentina. Let me tell you more about Max. Now, Maximiliano Guards is a seasoned professional with over 25 years of real estate and management experience. He operates the M. Guards, Nugosios in M.O. Bolarios, which is M.G.N.I, which serves the city of Buenos Aires in Argentina and the province of Buenos Aires, and is a member of the National Association of REALTORS. Guards attended Lincoln School in La Lusia for his elementary through high school education. So his American grandparents and mother played a crucial role in his ability to handle English-speaking clients, relations effectively. He pursued higher education at university, university, a del Salvador, and university, Nashino, Dula, Matanza, my apologies, I do not speak Spanish, so I'm doing my very very best. But M.G.N.I, his firm offers a range of services, including real estate transactions, property management, appraisals, and consultancy for both local and international clients. The reason that we're bringing Max on the show today is that we don't ever talk on the show about international investments outside of the U.S. And we figured, you know, with things being the way they are right now with U.S. real estate, in particular, with the NAR settlement that's obviously changed some things for buyers and sellers here in our market. That perhaps it would be a good idea to also introduce the idea of course, outside investments, and certainly people are doing that. And seven years on the show, and I haven't really ever had this conversation. So I'm so excited to bring on Max. Please visit Max on his website. And I'm going to spell it for you. It's m-g-o-t-z.com. Sorry, m-g-o-t-z.com. We have a link to that in the show notes as well. Max, welcome to the show. Thank you so much for having me, DJ. It's a thrill. Thank you. It's a thrill for me as well. I was telling, I was asking Max just to talk to the listeners for a second. Just before he came on, you'll notice Max does sound like he is not from Argentina, at least what I would assume. Somebody from Argentina born and raised it would sound like what he is. And we talked, you know, in his, in the little intro there, we talked about how he, you know, studied English, of course, growing up. But it is truly incredible. I, you, you probably have less of an accent, American accent than I do. But, but you have really, really, it's amazing that you've spent your whole life there. But how did you, how, you know, how did you, obviously, you were born there? How did your parents get to, to Argentina? Well, they, they had the foresight, my, my, my mother, who actually lived in the United States, and my grandparents who were New Yorkers. My grandparents would come and go to Argentina, and then they settled here for a number of years. And then they went back to the States and eventually retired in Florida. But my, my grandparents, my, my mother's parents, and my mother had kind of the foresight to K through 12, put me into the international school of which, you know, all, all capitals have one of these, were all the ex-fed kids and military kids, all these guys go to. And so, added to the fact that my mother, an English professor, my grandmother was also an English educator, and also from the United States. So you can imagine English was heavily spoken, not just at home, but obviously at school. Plus the fact that I would, during our winters and your summers, I would fly up to the States and spend two or three months at a time. So the language, the, the formality of the language was quickly added to all the nuance and the colloquialism and, and all that kind of fun stuff. And I guess to a degree, the fact that I love it, as much as I do, you know, the, the language and the meanings and stuff like that, I guess that also helped, you know, because like when you like something, it comes a bit easier. Absolutely. Well, it's incredible. I suspect you probably even meet people, you know, local natives in, in Buenos Aires, who probably go, oh, I didn't, wouldn't assume that you were born and raised here as well. I've been, I've been told I sound like someone who is from New York a lot, someone who's from Kansas, which was the first couple of years ago. And then one guy told me I sounded like Jeff Goldblum. So I've been trying to protect that too. You do have a little bit of Jeff Goldblum. I love it. I love it. Well, let's talk about real estate in Argentina. So first of all, how did you get into the real estate industry down there? Well, I started one of my very first jobs as cliche as the sounds was in real estate for a number of months. And then I moved on to other things and eventually went to university. But I kind of liked it and I liked the fact that it involved working with people. I was in law school for a number of years and it wasn't my thing. I did not enjoy it. So right around the time of being either second or third year law school student, a friend of a friend had a foreign couple that needed help managing a property that they had here in Buenos Aires. So I took that as a kind of a odd job and we managed it and we did the pre-earb and B thing, which is VRBO. Sure. Parentals, which was at the time pretty big here, exploding. So we started with managing that property and that in a good way sort of snowballed into two apartments, four apartments, ten apartments. And I said, well, you know, gosh, I'm going to kind of professionalize this and make a make a website and make a this and make that. Once it became a kind of a fixed nine to five or actually Monday to Monday job where we also added city tours and concierge services. That plus the fact that I wasn't having any fun at school, I sort of began doing that altogether, just that branch of real estate. And over time, what happened was a lot of people wanted to buy foreigners would come down and say, wow, you know, I love my stay here and I would really like to consider working or buying something here. So that over time, I because I wasn't licensed at the time, I had to send my clients across the street to someone who was licensed and then in the hopes of getting a commission from them. So that prompted me to go back to school and become a REALTOR, which in Argentina is a is a three year college course. It's not a wow. Yeah, yeah, it's a college course. But essentially, that's what had happened. And one of my one of my favorite stories is that early on, we had a guy from Southern California, who to this day is a client and a very kind of, you know, agreeable single guy who travels the world, he said, look, I'd like to take you out to dinner and learn more about buying real estate. So we went out to dinner as a business dinner. And we hit it off. And at one point, the conversation for for whatever reason, something reminded me of a scenario from the TV show, Seinfeld, which I know for you guys was massively popular. And I'm a huge fan. And this guy happened to be probably right up there as big a fan as I am. And so that immediately shifted the conversation from, here's how you buy here. And what you do, what you don't do to remember the episode when remember the episode when. And so from there, the restaurant was closing. We went for a couple of years. We continued to talk about that cut to 17 years later, the guy is still a client. We manage his property. And we're still talking about the same, you know, silliness. So, you know, you just the business just goes forward organically, however it will. But it kind of in a way found me because it mixed things that I like, which is working with people working with foreigners with whom I kind of have a rapport, especially US and Canada, because that's kind of the culture that I was surrounded by. And so, yeah, I went back to college. I did the, you know, I majored as we're about to course credits for that. And, and, you know, started up and formalized it even more. Well, thank you. Tell us a little bit about the real estate market in Argentina. Sort of what are you currently experiencing there? And where do you see opportunities? Maybe even challenges. Yeah, well, to answer your question directly, we are now in what could best be described the 50 or 60 or maybe even of a buyer's market. It's been a buyer's market for a long time. And I do think we've already hit rock bottom, although we're not far above rock bottom. And for those who may not know this, and there's no reason why you would know this. But when a site is presents the ability to buy a real estate at prices, which are fantastic when you compare them to other world class cities in New York, you know, I don't know, Berlin, London, Paris, and Paris, at a fraction of the cost really. And with some of the most beautiful architecture, you will find. And a very Latin ambiance because, you know, we have this, this, it's like New York, it's a melting pot. And our forefathers are the Spanish and the Italian and to a lesser degree, the Germans and the Austrians and so forth. We have the eighth largest Jewish population here. And it's also worth noting that Argentina is the eighth largest geography in the world. So it's got one of the largest deposits of potable water, lithium. So there's a lot of business to be had. And so that if the right government runs the country, which we could circle back to that. But you've also got everything you need in the way of tourism, you've got desert, you've got the US who falls, which are one of the UNESCO heritage sites around the world. You've got beach, you've got skiing, you've got the glaciers down south. So there's a little bit for everyone. And I would argue maybe the best food in South America or certainly certainly of the best food, maybe prove it might might might think, you know, every country thinks they probably have the best food. But Argentina is one of the one of the South American countries that makes its way up here. We have Argentinian stakeholders here in Chicago, New York, bigger cities have them. I don't see a lot from other South American countries. The beef to be sure, I don't know about the food as a general. I love our local food. I also love, you know, I love I love food in the US. I love food here. It's all it's all got its things. But the beef here is I would like to be objective in saying I think it is second to none. But yes, we have we have very good beef. We have very good produce. And the yes, the real estate market is undergoing still what you would call a buyers market. And we have seen more. In fact, our niche has become over the years, the foreign investor and assisting them in the process of either buying real estate or selling real estate. They already own it from before or everything in the middle management or consultancy or whatever. Now, I'm going to tell you one thing, which is possibly the biggest cultural shock that you will come to find about real estate or Argentina. And it is that transactions are are done 90% of the time. If not more cash on the barrel head. And what I mean by that is you come with the money you laid on the table. The money is counted and the deed is signed. Okay, here's your money. Here's your keys. Thanks for, you know, thanks for everything and the notary witnesses and that's that we do not have 20 year mortgages financing is very hard to come by for locals never mind foreigners. So in order to buy real estate. Most of the time you need to have the cash much like, you know, a clonese movie where the guy comes in with the dollar satchels and plops them on the table. You come in with a cash. And that's just the way it's worked for many, many years and you know, we're hoping to be able to join the 21st century and and come up with other more pragmatic and safer solutions. But for in the meantime, that's how it's that's how the final leg of it is done with cash. And how has the rental market been you mentioned VRBO being the the leader in that sort of space and the in the short term rental space or the online short term rental space, certainly for people visiting. And now of course Airbnb probably taking taking the lead on that or maybe they're battling it out depends on I guess which country. But how is the I know to I guess we're talking about tourism. So I know tourism was huge pre COVID obviously COVID changed everything for every country, not not necessarily Argentina. But you know, there was there was a huge drop off in tourism, you know, once COVID hit obviously now things are back to relative normalcy have you seen an increase in uptick in, you know, Americans coming down there people from other countries obviously visiting. How is how is the tourism been. Well, yeah, tour, well, here's what's interesting during COVID our office saw a huge influx of work and it's incredible because obviously many real stifler arms had to shut down had to stop working really because they depend on on sales and rentals and a lot of stuff had shut down. And it was you were kind of adding insult to injury there because the Argentine economy was already not in a good place is in bad shape. So this was like a like a, you know, an elderly patient who gets a virus in the hospital versus a young healthy patient. So we were already kind of, you know, not doing great. Now, this is very interesting what happened was COVID hit pandemic hit everything was shut down and a whole lot of people that were scheduled to leave were suddenly stuck in Argentina. So they needed housing right away many of those people were kind of, you know, flirting with the idea of buying something they were forced to pull the trigger but many more needed long term housing. So all of a sudden a barrage of people would contact us about I need a place I can't leave and many other people who were getting during the first few months where people would get I don't know about the rest of the world, but here you would get special permits to fly into Argentina. If you were a foreigner because my wife is Argentine or I'm about to be married or my child is about to be born. We had a lot of that. So we had to help people find a home solution. So there was that. And it yeah, we we saw quite a few people who who I mean again work kind of really, really blew up, which was strange, you know tourism tourist tourist or tour agencies had to pretty much shut down. They had no money coming in, but some real estate firms are at least hours. We saw quite a bit of work. Now yeah, you're right tourism prior to that was doing really well. And once COVID sort of ended, it blew up again. I think we've been getting records of amount of people coming into Argentina. The dollar still gets you a very long way, even though Argentina has an endemic inflation problem 243% in or annual last time. And you know, we came out this month for foreigners to say for you coming down in US dollars, it's still kind of a deal. There are things you will find to be more expensive and there are things you'll find to be dirt cheap. But you will all of that, I think to a degree, takes a back seat to the fact that people just feel like they are, they fall in love with with not just Buenos Aires, but generally speaking what they go out and and do in in in Argentina. And yes, the Airbnb tool, which we use, became increasingly popular among people here so much so that this was sometimes after VRB, although it happened with VRB as well. But hotels started to heavily lobby Congress for added taxes or for like a kind of a list where people would jot down their names and say, okay, look, I'm renting through Airbnb and so forth. This being Argentina, this being a Latin mindset, not a whole many people wrote themselves down at that, you know, Gestapo list that the government wanted us to sign up for or not us, but the owners. But hotels were having a bad time at it because they could no longer charge whatever they wanted all of a sudden they had this, this kind of a new layer. The markets dictating a different, different price. Yeah, yeah. But Airbnb operates illegally, legally, and we haven't had that situation that you guys have had in New York in the few other cities where it's kind of all but banned. So we do see it there. We do see it here. And it's it's very, very much used. And you know, again, our office uses it as a tool. I would say it represents about of our vacation or short-term rental leg of business, a good 20 or 25% of what comes in. So, you know, needless to say, it's it's pretty, it's pretty important. So if I was, if I am a REALTOR here in the US and I have investor clients who are cash heavy, who are looking for either. So I guess there's two types, well, there's more than two types of investors, but the two types that are coming to mind at the moment is the second vacation home or I vacation home, maybe down in Argentina where I visited, I love it, I want to return and rent it out, maybe, you know, higher you would have managed it along the way. When I'm not there, let's let's keep it full. Or maybe people who of course just want to keep it empty for the higher net worth individuals, maybe who just need a second place. And then of course the more sort of the investor who is really just looking for a cash return on their investment. So what would you say to them as far as why they should consider. And again, there's three different buckets there, but I know I'm asking kind of a complicated question, but let's tackle one at a time. So for the for the for the person who visits Argentina, falls in love like my sister did last year when she visited and I sadly was unable to accompany her and my brother-in-law and my net my six my seven year old nephew has been to Argentina and I have not and I am I'm angry about this. But I mean, I'm not really angry, but I find it so funny that a seven year old made it there before I did, but they fell in love with it. They came back. They're like, you have to go. So now they're giving me grief that I have to go. But what would you say to somebody who, you know, why should they consider, you know, a long term investment there? Yeah, well, first of all, I completely agree. I think you hit the nail on the head. The two I would say main investment groups are those two. And by the way, they're not necessarily mutually exclusive. But the guy that falls in love to be sure wants a second home to be sure. But the second group, which I find to be the most interesting group is the guy that is playing the capital gains gain. You know, he's going to buy something at a down market, which of its own you can get something which would otherwise cost you a New York City. $600,000, maybe here for $120,000. And I mean, a one bedroom in a good area with a view, so for the so on. And I'm just comparing New York as it's the only market that I kind of tangentially know about and even. But I would say, yeah, you, you would, you know, just what our grandparents taught us you by low and you sell high, you keep it over time. Do not expect to make a short term ROI. Do not sell to a client that you are going to buy, put it nice and premium proper, put it on the market and start getting $3,000 a month clean from your rental. So for many reasons, not the least of which is there is a large supply of real estate being offered for short term rentals. And also because of the fact that you, you know, while it is yes, inexpensive city. And given the fact that there's so much supply, you can't ask whatever you want. You might have the most beautiful three bedroom penthouse unit overlooking the river and so forth. But if you put it at a price, which people do not want to pay, they're not going to pay. And our client base, which as I said is predominantly the North American client base, you know, you guys are pretty savvy. You guys shop around you guys have a culture of knowing the value of your currency. So while there are people who will try to overcharge, I think the season tourist or even not season tourist knows how to shop around for pricing. So again, I think I think we were talking about earlier, but if you were to take a pie chart of why would someone buy an Argentina and want someone from Chicago, you might say, yes, okay. The investment game of buying low or buying low selling high, the fact that, you know, I have a second home, I can make some money off of it. I can air be and be it out and then during the winter months, all escape Chicago and I'll come down for a month or whatever. Nowadays, you've got the digital nomad things. But in that pie chart, I can tell you in my conversations over and over and over again, it's the fact that, man, I love it here. Man, the lack of nature of things, the fact that it's not as, you know, buttoned up as in the US or Canada or pockets of Europe, the fact that it's also Lucy Kusie. It's a common denominator in my conversations with people. And that would make a good 20 or 25% of that of that pie chart. I tell you, it's just one of those things. Or they say, look, I didn't know what to expect. And I just, I love it. I just love it here. I remember visiting Nicaragua probably 10 years ago on a vacation and ended up so Central America ended up, I can't remember the, gosh, the city's escaping me at the moment. But I think it's San Juan. Anyway, it doesn't matter. Anyway, we ended up at this surfing area in Nicaragua, very famous, apparently. And we were staying at this echolage, this really kind of cool place that with other Americans who were staying there. And one of them was actually they were Australians and they were going to invest in and build a condo or build some sort of home on the beach. And it was really exciting and cool to hear their story. And then I thought, hmm, well, Nicaragua again, not comparing Nicaragua and Argentina, but just sort of a foreign investment idea. It was like, wasn't Nicaragua somewhat unstable at some point government unstable. I know they had their share of issues years and years ago. But I said, you know, did that factor into your decision as far as the stability of the economy, the stability of the political system there and who's running things, of course. And they said, yeah, but they were confident that they felt, you know, the government was competent and not was wasn't going to be overthrown. Does that come up in conversations with investors about this sort of what's going on in Argentina? And I'm not suggesting there's anything to be concerned about, but just we just don't know. Yeah, no, no, well, well, first of all, you had you don't have to but pick up a newspaper and read what's going on in Argentina, but Argentina does have has had and continues to have its share of economic crises. As I said, inflation is probably top most on the list recession corrupt governments things with that nature. Now, the wonderful thing though is and I like to tell my foreign clients this, you know, let's say DJ you fly down you buy something you get the best of both worlds and why do I say that because you're able to enjoy all the great things that the country has to offer without having to put up with the BS that it also has to offer. You know, one guy once asked me, hey, you guys have any, you know, you have hurricanes or earth we're getting natural. No, no, no, we don't have any of that. Thankfully, we just have government. So, you know, we are only as good as the people who govern us are and I think thankfully these last elections have kind of, you know, there's been some wins of change in that regard and I think we're moving towards a different and much better place. But people do ask us that and the great thing is I can speak to other countries where in Latin America or in the Americas where something like that would affect a foreign investor. There are stories about Costa Rica, Brazil, even Canada has certain laws and bylaws that you cannot buy as an American unless Argentina, thankfully has nothing like that. The owning property in Argentina is the process of getting from A to Z to be sure is complex and we do hand holding and that's kind of where we, I think, stand apart and I think what we like most about our job, which is explaining, okay, now this is going to happen and now this is going to happen. Now that's good. But the reality is once it's all said and done, there is a notary public, which is not to be confused with how you guys have notaries in the United States and they have a rubber stamp at kinkos. Here, a notary public is necessarily a lawyer and it's very, very hard to become a notary public and he is the person who is in charge of not just signing and witnessing and stamping, but also he is in charge of the due diligence, which includes, but is limited to title study insurance. He's the guy who will say, look, gentlemen, this cannot be signed because it appears that there is a lien on this property from the seller or it appears that there is an embargo on that person's salary or whatever. So once all that's been completed and the due diligence done and everything is okay and you DJ sign as the buyer, that's the end of it. No one can come out of the woodwork and say, hey, look, I'm the long lost sign of the seller. I didn't approve this. No, you're not because you know, this is, we did all the due diligence, we did all our homework and here's the deed, which by the way, it comes in a special sheet of paper with a number and then sent to the county registrar's office, recorded, comes back and given to you. And that's it. It's yours. Squatters rights, expropriation, anything. Expropriation to be fair does exist in Argentina as it does in any country. But as we know, it has to do with taking the property or group of properties for the greater good, like a highway, like that kind of thing. But you don't really hardly ever see that at all. So to your question, sorry, I kind of went off the reservation, but no, you don't, it doesn't, it doesn't affect if anything, if anything, you know, when there are economic woes and a buyer's market presented self, that's when, I mean, you know, you're preaching to the choir, I guess here, but that's kind of when you strike, right, when the iron is hot. Sure. It's interesting. I looked up because I was curious, I don't, I don't usually hear Argentina in the news with respect to unrest. They don't usually participate in a lot of outside war or even internal war. And so I was on Wikipedia, I go, wonder when the last time Argentina's had a real serious sort of arms conflict. And, and 1994, which was during, basically, the, the, well, actually, I take it back. Yeah, 1994 was kind of the last time that I found in it. I'm not even sure it was called Operation Talos. But anyway, that's the last time on Wikipedia that there was any sort of, you know, acknowledgement of, you know, any sort of movement within within the, within the country or with their participation outside or people, you know, invading or coming in. So it seems to be a very stable and safe country. I mean, certainly the United States has had plenty of conflicts since 1994. Yeah, I mean, it's an interesting, it's an interesting perspective. I would agree, wholeheartedly, stable, it depends on your definition. It is a democratically stable country for sure. And because of the fact that we had military dictatorships for a number of years, the last of which was extremely bloody. And, and, you know, most people know about the fact that, you know, people disappeared and, and so forth. They made a point of protecting democracy in a very, very big way. So democracy returned to Argentina in 1983. And yeah, I would say that from a democratic standpoint, Argentina is like the US. It's a federal democracy. And so a federal republic. And so, yeah, we've made a point of making it, I think, well, we, you know, country has made a point of having to be safe. Now, stable, it depends on how you define stable economically, ish, fiscally ish. But we, I think we are certainly trying to better ourselves in that regard. But there again, the investing of real estate does not see itself affected by whatever fiscal instability there might be. You're going to buy real estate, and it's going to be there. And you can do with it whatever you want. Now, if you, DJ, as a Chicago native, want to come to Argentina and start an import export business, or you want to open a restaurant, or you want to open any other type of business, that's going to require a lot more due diligence because those kinds of things will see themselves affected more, more noticeably on the day to day. You're going to have employees. You're going to have taxes to be paid. You're, excuse me. But with real estate, it's something that you buy, and it's a degree to wish it's a one off so much so that you can say, I got the set of killing. I'm going to just leave it there, have someone pay for the taxes, water the plants. I'm going to wait 10 years. And then I'll sell it when the market turns people have done that. Yeah, and also, too, we should just mention, and this is something that just my ignorance of geography up until probably a few years ago, certainly in South America, my knowledge of where the countries are all positioned is not is embarrassingly poor. But Argentina is also how we oftentimes get to Antarctica, right? For Antarctica tours, I know there are ways to get there from Argentina. So this also become, I mean, Argentina just was really a very versatile country. There's a lot that you could do there as a tourist. There's a lot of places you can go, I have friends that have gone and done, you know, marathon's down in Antarctica or some sort of, you know, I don't know if it was, you know, an Iron Man triad. Yeah, we have. We've had those, yeah, yeah. Yeah. And no, it's all typically go right into Argentina on the way. Yeah, no, you're right. Argentina is the tours to Antarctica start here. You fly down to one of the southern most provinces. I think from there, you fly over to E. La Marvina, which is otherwise known as Falcland Islands to many. And then you go to Antarctica. And the people that I know that I've done that, they swoon over it. They say it's fantastic. And I have heard more than once. I think it's because of the fact that they are eventually going to try to do away with that because of what it's doing to the environment over a course of decades. I don't know, I don't know if that's for not. But yeah, to your point, Argentina has it. And a lot of people, especially my European clients, don't quite capture the massive nature of the country. And they say, you know, I'm going for five days. I'd like to see the falls and the beach and the glacier. And these are people who walk five blocks and are in a different country, not so much here. You got to take a flight to say the E. Guasu Falls, which is two hours. You got to fly down to where the glaciers are, which is like three hours. But to be sure, we do have it all. We've got mountain, we've got skiing, we've got beach, we've got the E. Guasu Falls. The city of B.A. alone has some of the most beautiful architecture you'll see. We've got, I think, one of the, it was in a list somewhere, one of the either biggest or most beautiful bookstores, which used to be a theater house. We have a lot of those, you know, biggest or best of or whatever. The river that separates Argentina with Uruguay is the biggest, is the widest river in the world, although technically it's not really a river. It's an estuary, but I digress. But it's, you know, there's, yeah, you're right. There's, there's lots to do. Just the city of B.A. alone. There's plenty to do. And, you know, with tourism, return, we're having returned and I don't anticipate any sign of that slowing other than being some sort of, you know, calamity like we had with COVID. This is a place where people will return to time and time again. So from an investment perspective, you know, unless something changes and the government, you know, for whatever reason becomes unfriendly to tourism, which I'm sure will not be the case, because it's such a big driver for the economy is going to be a pretty stable investment. It sounds like at least in the idea of getting tourists there and, you know, enjoying what Argentina has to offer. Yeah, well, this, this new government, which is by all accounts, what you might characterize as a libertarian government, very, very much to the right. In fact, this president, who has also been on a, on everybody's lips of late, is the first Argentine president to be an economist, which is, if you think about it, it's a huge deal, especially in a country that has suffered inflation for decades. In fact, we are of the few countries along around the world that has not stomped out inflation. It's, you know, everyone else is kind of, yeah, you guys are now having this, this kind of pick up of it again and so forth, but really inflation has been all but, but, you know, we've had lawyers, a lot of lawyers, we've had one dentist, one MD, and of course, military, military core presence, but I think that opening up the floodgates of foreign investment certainly peaks the interest of the world, we think. Well, well, it's really a great opportunity. So if I, if I'm a REALTOR here and either I'm interested in exploring, bring this to my clients who maybe are high net worth clients who want maybe a second home, where they either let it sit or rent it while they're not there, or maybe investor, maybe even institutional investor, who is, you know, looking for, you know, good cash flow. So what's really the best way someone could start to sort of get a hold of what's how it works down there and how they should present it to their clients. Well, I mean, to be sure information is key and in this age of the internet and everything else, information certainly is online. There's a lot of it, which is faulty and there's a lot of it, which is an exact, but there's a lot of it, which is, which at least gives you a starting point. And in our case, we made it a point to be members of the REALTORS Association up in the state so that we could have a foothold and if anybody needed something, our name was there and, you know, they could reach out to us in English, no less. So there would be nothing lost in translation. Also members of, for example, the Argentine at Texas Chamber of Commerce. And again, in our case, we set up these webinars and we even, I even wrote a couple of ebooks that detail what the process is and gives people a primer of what to do and what to know and what to expect. And then from there, people really need only Google real estate firms in Argentina and find out which ones are good, which ones are not or actually, you know, determine themselves, which ones are good, which ones are bad and take it from there. But reading up on it, maybe calling the NAR, maybe also reaching out to REALTORS, you know, Argentina forums, you know, forums are also great for that online forums. Now that I'm thinking about it, I have a friend because at National Association REALTORS is headquartered here in Chicago, one of my good friends who is a Chicago and is really native to the Philippines. And she is the ambassador, or I'm not sure exactly what the title is, but all call her ambassador for NAR to the Philippines. And so she represents NAR visits Philippines and sort of, you know, is always passing information back and forth. I suspect there is one as well with NAR for Argentina. And yeah, and so that's another option too is to call NAR and say, hey, I would like to learn a little bit more about Argentina as there's someone I can connect with. Usually the way that NAR works is they will find someone who is natively born, oftentimes natively born in that country, who really understands the customs and culture and the politics and the financial, the fiscal sort of policies. And then sort of as that person becomes a resource to other REALTORS as well as yourself. Well, NAR, as you probably know, they have a collection of courses that they offer us. And I did the, what is it the CIPS, the Certified International Property Specialist one. And I was, which was very enlightening in terms of how REALTOR works in other American countries, come to find Argentina wasn't in the course. So I did the course. I reached out and said, hey, I recently completed this list. And I'd like to throw my hand in the ring to create the chapter of Argentina and add it there because you guys don't have Argentina and you can't not have Argentina. So that's in the works. I guess I have to talk to him again now that I think about it. But that would be potentially one way in which the word could be, could be made to come out and that. But I do think that the number one way that it's that is word of mouth and it's people saying, hey, I was recently an Argentine or, hey, my brother and I was an Argentine. Well, you know, go no further. You're saying to me that your sister in law came back and said, yep, you got to go. You got to go. So so that happens a lot and and people seem to to really like it. The word of mouth, I think, is is. And again, this day these days with internet, you can find out anything. Sure. And then you got to get the right tools and the right people and take it from there. Well, if anyone would be interested in maybe reviewing some of your your ebooks around sort of priming oneself to sort of get started understanding what the real estate sort of process is down in Argentina, the investment process. What's the best way that they should reach out to you? Well, I think the best way to reach out to us is just through our website. We're on social media and things of that nature. And if they just want to reach out via email or WhatsApp or we also have a US number. We have like a like a pre fab text file that we send them. And they don't even have to subscribe or click here to subscribe and get spam mail. All they need to do is reach out and say, hey, you know, I read about you or heard about you. I'd like to learn more. And we were applied to them with a series of links, the two or three ebooks that we wrote. The webinar that we were that was hosted by the Argentina Texas Chamber of Commerce. And then just for yucks, we were in an episode of House Hunters International. So we send that link along too. And again, it doesn't come with any need for them to subscribe or anything like that. They're not going to get hit with emails. They're just going to get replied to when they reach out to us. So, but yeah, through the website, which I think you said the domain, what that was or you might add it later, but they can just reach out to us through there. And that domain is M G O T Z M technically m grits dot com, but we're going to say it the way it's spelled M M gots M G O T Z dot com is where you can learn about all things max as well as his firm. And what he offers when with respect to not only management of real estate assets, but of course helping people find and procure and also run or get deals closed, of course, in foreign land. So max, thank you so much. So anyone out there who has who works with investors, who has investors that are looking for, you know, maybe outside investments to the US or want a second home. This is a great opportunity. And I know for sure Argentina is on my list now. Well, it's a bit on my list to go visit. I still have to still have to do Peru as well. My brother-in-law is Peruvian and I have yet to to to make it down there. But I will do them both in one trip and that would be that would be an amazing trip. But anyway, if anyone out there is interested in learning more M G O T Z dot com is where you go reach out to max. Let them know you heard him on the show and on behalf of our audience. So max, thank you so much. This was really educational for me and for the audience really understanding that hey, you know, real estate is yes hyper local for the markets we serve. But of course there's other markets outside of not just our local market, but of course even our country that we want to consider as real estate agents. You know, we have a fiduciary responsibility as REALTORS to our clients and one of those is, you know, becoming educated on good up fiduciary opportunities for clients. So this is one to consider. Certainly Argentina is the reputation of tourism to us love it. I have yet to meet somebody who didn't enjoy visiting Argentina. It's kind of like there's there's some countries that are like that Italy's like that people you know you never heard anybody say I went to Italy and that just wasn't. I didn't like it. Yeah, that's true. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Argentina. Yeah, Argentina has that same exact sort of reputation and there's a reason for that and you know the culture, the scenery, the architecture, the people as well as the food. And so please consider doing that and reaching out and learning about it and let Max know again MGOTZ.com is the website to learn about all things Argentina. And Max on behalf of our audience, thank you for coming on our show love having somebody from from the Southern hemisphere on our show. And so it's not very often we get to do that. And although you sound just like me so it sounds like it seems like we're in the same room. But we are very far away, but I am excited to to plan my trip down there with with with my girlfriend and hopefully make it there maybe even next year. We'll give it a shot. I'll talk to her tonight about it. But on behalf of our audience, thank you Max on behalf of Max. Thank you to our audience for sticking around until the end. We appreciate you.
