[00:01:17] Today's episode is brought to you by corded.io. Are you looking for agents to join your brokerage
[00:01:24] your team? Now, as a real estate recruiter, I can tell you the answer is always yes. But most
[00:01:30] agents aren't looking to move right now. So how do you know who to contact? Well, what if I were to
[00:01:35] tell you there's a recruiting and retention tool powered by artificial intelligence that shows
[00:01:39] you exactly which agents in your local market are looking to leave their brokerage right now and
[00:01:45] which agents at your own firm are also looking to leave you? Now, I've been recruiting REALTORS for
[00:01:51] 15 years and I've hired over 2000 agents. I can tell you with no exaggeration, this is the tool
[00:01:58] I've been waiting for. Corded's AI looks for trends across dozens of variables for each agent in
[00:02:03] your market and shows you which agents they believe are likely to move. Not only does it do that,
[00:02:09] but corded's AI went and visited my recruiting website and read everything I offer. So now when I'm
[00:02:15] recruiting, corded's AI tells me exactly what to say based on that agent's needs and what my brokerage
[00:02:21] can offer. It even writes emails for me. I've never seen anything like it and I use it every single day.

[00:02:53] Welcome to another episode of Keeping It Real, the largest podcast made by real estate agents and
[00:03:00] four real estate agents. My name is DJ Paris. I'm your guide and host through this show. And today is
[00:03:06] our monthly series Learn with a Lender with Christian Batchelder. I'm going to tell you more about
[00:03:12] Christian and then I'm going to ask you to help us out with your next transaction. So let's tell you
[00:03:17] more about Christian together with David Green. By the way, if you don't know Christian and David,
[00:03:21] they became super well known on a great site called Bigger Pockets, which is a place where
[00:03:28] typically people learn about how to become real estate investors. It's the largest form in the
[00:03:32] in the country and they became very, very popular there. And so after sort of working there,
[00:03:40] a David and Christian co-founded at their own firm, which is called the One Brokage,
[00:03:45] Team the fastest growing broker in the nation in 2021 and 2022, ranked in the top 20 brokerages
[00:03:52] by funded loan volume. Christian is a UC Berkeley grad. He has a bachelor's in chemical engineering,
[00:03:57] but he hated that industry and wanted to get out of cap turning potential. He got into real estate
[00:04:03] with the help of a childhood family friend and had some success in the business and discovered he
[00:04:08] had a knack for connecting with people and adding value to their mindsets, investments, and journeys.

[00:04:28] best loan and how to protect one's investments with insurance policies and other forms of asset
[00:04:33] protection. He discussed speaker purchased 15 properties himself in the last 12 months,
[00:04:40] employing the same principles he teaches you. He created a course for loan officers to enroll
[00:04:45] to teach the fundamentals of the sales process, how to become the best advisor possible, how to

[00:05:46] kind words and if anybody out there is listening and does want to take a peek by our website or

[00:05:57] I'd love to help. Give me a shout at any time. Yeah, this guy is an actual legend in not only the
[00:06:03] real estate investing space, but the loan space and also the real estate broker space. He is kind of a
[00:06:10] Renaissance man in this industry well known. It's kind of a celebrity and we're super lucky to have
[00:06:15] him and he is coming to us all the way from LA, which we are excited to chat with them about. So
[00:06:21] Christian, I know a lot of agents these days. It's tough market out there. It's tough inventory's
[00:06:27] low. Rates are a little bit higher than anyone would probably prefer, but still not too bad.
[00:06:33] But we're having certainly seeing a lot of news out there with the Fed. I saw today,
[00:06:40] Trump said he is not interested in firing Powell the head of the Fed, but we'll see what happens.
[00:06:46] Of course, his opinions in mind changes seemingly day to day, but certainly the market responded.
[00:06:52] I saw the Dow did well today, which is exciting. So it looks like at least the equity markets are
[00:07:00] responding favorably, but of course, as REALTOR as we want to know about rates for our buyer clients
[00:07:06] who are sitting on the sidelines. So again, nobody has a crystal ball, but what's your take on
[00:07:10] everything that's going on? Very interesting, very tough to predict. And coming from me,
[00:07:17] that means a lot as somebody who is ridiculously studied in the industry. I literally have made a
[00:07:24] career of obviously giving advice and educating. And obviously the most common question that I get
[00:07:30] is where rates go. That's what everybody wants to talk to a lender about. What a rate? What can I
[00:07:35] get my debt at? And if you're in escrow, it's when should I lock my rate? Are they going up?
[00:07:40] Are they going down? What should I do to compensate for? But what's the best direction I need to take?
[00:07:45] And I will tell you these last three, four weeks have been the hardest time period to advise
[00:07:54] since I've been in the industry, which is a decade plus now at this point. Gosh,
[00:08:02] 15, 17 years, something, no? Great. 15 years, I think I got my first like intern job in the industry.
[00:08:10] But still, regardless, harder than COVID when the whole world thought it was shutting down,
[00:08:17] right? And it was not this difficult to predict rates. Now, granted it COVID, everybody was happy
[00:08:21] with the rate. We were talking about a 2% go into a 3%. Now, obviously, with the rates being where
[00:08:27] they are, it's a little different. But what I will say to just give a general standpoint is really what
[00:08:33] I'd like to convey to the audience in this episode is helping you guys understand not only what the
[00:08:41] market does, but understand how in the background, what is eventually leading to these rates?
[00:08:51] What's leading to the increases? What's leading to the decreases? What is impacting them?
[00:08:55] It's not really what you would think. A lot of people await for Jerome Powell to come out and
[00:08:58] his monthly press conference say we're raising or lowering rates. And they say,
[00:09:01] whoo, market rates are cheaper or more expensive. It's not true. And, you know,
[00:09:07] I mean, you were talking earlier and we said, you know, hey, why is it, you know, when the fed
[00:09:12] cuts rates, there's not always a one-to-one correlation, right? With market rates coming down.
[00:09:16] And we're going to get into that today in detail and give you guys a little more concrete understanding
[00:09:21] behind the scenes. And most importantly, give you guys some good content to use on your calls with your
[00:09:27] clients. Yeah, let's dive in. So, right now, there's a lot of uncertainty. The stock market has
[00:09:34] certainly been up and down and some values gone out. It's come back. And, you know, we're just
[00:09:40] consumer confidence is kind of in a strange place. And the banks aren't totally sure what to do.
[00:09:45] I think. And so, you know, what are you seeing out there?
[00:09:51] Yeah, uncertainty. Let me, let me give you guys a gist of what actually happens here.
[00:09:58] Let's just use tariffs as an example because that's our common current event right now.
[00:10:05] When Trump first announced them, the stock market dropped significantly. And I'm talking,
[00:10:11] you know, it was, it was like four to six percent for like three straight days. Because I
[00:10:15] remember it happened on a Wednesday. It was Wednesday Thursday Friday, three runner, runner,
[00:10:19] and other days where we were talking recession. Everybody was on fire and it's like, now,
[00:10:25] the mortgage rates did great. Over those three days, we dropped about a full percent in mortgage
[00:10:33] rates. We were hovering around to 6.9 when it started. Just as your average 30-year conventional rate.
[00:10:38] And we actually got down to like six and a quarter. So almost, you know, 0.75, you know,
[00:10:43] getting close to a full percent drop. In the course of three days, that's like incredible movement.
[00:10:49] Now, why does that happen? A lot of people can say, oh, well, the mortgage market and securities,
[00:10:54] which is the stock market, a lot of times people say in, in, in, incorrectly, but they say
[00:11:01] commonly that they move inversely to each other, right? So if the stock market goes down,
[00:11:06] mortgage rates will, will get better, right? You know, which means lower in our, in our case.
[00:11:12] Now, the reason why that is is because of how the, the investing kind of infrastructure works in
[00:11:19] America. When money is retracted from the stock market, obviously that will lead to decreasing stock
[00:11:25] prices, right? There's less buyers, which means that they're not as much demand. So they have to
[00:11:29] drop prices in order to incentivize. When money exits stocks, Facebook, Amazon, Apple, whatever,
[00:11:38] it needs somewhere to go. And historically, and somewhat traditionally, that money will typically
[00:11:44] retreat into the bond market. Now, so you guys understand bonds. It's basically government debt
[00:11:49] and mortgage back securities are a form of them, right? So when they enter the bonds, leave the
[00:11:55] securities market, securities of stocks and enter the bonds market, that typically has a downward
[00:12:01] pressure on interest rates. And let me say this in a way that is super easy to understand, and you
[00:12:06] guys can, can kind of copy and paste this conversation with your clients and you sound super smart,
[00:12:11] right? Say securities and bonds and all these fancy words, right? So as money floods into
[00:12:18] the bonds market, there's now more buyers. So consider this like your house, right? The bond
[00:12:25] market is your house that you're making an offer on. Imagine you went from having one buyer
[00:12:30] where you're probably going to get bid down and get an undervalue offer, right? And now you have
[00:12:34] 15 buyers. Everybody scrambling. It's COVID 2020 all over again, right? Every house has 25 offers on
[00:12:40] that's what happens when money floods into the bond market. So because of that, because there's an
[00:12:45] influx of buyers, the rates can think of it this way, the people issuing the bonds can get a better
[00:12:52] deal, which means they don't have to pay as much return, right? Because more people want them.
[00:12:58] So it's inverted because a better return is a higher rate, but that's worse for us. So being a less
[00:13:06] strong investment to the person buying the debt, I want to make sure I'm being clear here because
[00:13:12] this gets a little complicated. They can drive the rates down because they don't have to pay as high
[00:13:18] as a return, okay? So typically when something like what happened a few weeks ago happens,
[00:13:25] the rates will do great. And they did for three days. The problem is that money did not flood into
[00:13:32] the bond market. And this really diverged from what the expectation was. So what happened is all
[00:13:38] this money retreated from the stock market and banks prepared, they dropped all their rates because
[00:13:44] they expected that money to flood into the bond market and it didn't really happen. So if you
[00:13:50] follow and you track the 10-year treasury, which is a rough correlation of where mortgage rates are,
[00:13:56] you'll be able to see a huge drop for three days and then a huge spike up. And now we're actually
[00:14:01] sitting higher than we were before. The reason being, the buyers didn't come. So you guys list the
[00:14:09] equivalent to this is you guys listed your property at a super low price because you were expecting to
[00:14:15] inside a bidding war and it didn't happen. The buyers didn't come. Now you're sitting there with
[00:14:22] the house that's under listed and the buyers and the sellers mad. What do you do? You kind of showed
[00:14:28] all your cards, you got put it out there and you made a miscalculation. That's what banks did a
[00:14:39] bond to actions they respond to news. So for instance, when Jerome Powell comes out and just for
[00:14:48] Reverend Jerome Powell is the head of the US Fed, he's the chair of the Fed. He comes out and he's
[00:14:54] the one who kind of determines the monetary policy in America. When he comes out and he says,
[00:15:00] hey guys, great news, we're going to drop rates. The banks knew he was going to say that three months
[00:15:06] earlier. They already made their adjustments. Let me give you an example of what could have. He
[00:15:11] could say, hey guys, we're going to drop rates this month but our next six month period were anticipating
[00:15:18] increasing rates twice. If this would be a super rare scenario because he wouldn't drop and then
[00:15:25] immediately re-raise. But let's just imagine it was on that day where Jerome Powell dropped rates,
[00:15:31] mortgage rates would actually go up because the banks would be pricing in those future two increases.
[00:15:36] So that's where people don't really understand that they just sit there and wait for Jerome Powell
[00:15:40] to say what he's going to say and you're listening to the wrong part of the conversation. You should
[00:15:44] be listening to what he says is coming not what he's doing today. That will impact mortgage rates.
[00:15:53] Give you a little background. Yeah, that was a mouthful but that's a five minute run down of the
[00:16:01] of the bond market in America. No, I love it. It's super helpful. And also we should remember too that
[00:16:08] rates are always something that obviously are beyond our control and also just kind of is what
[00:16:15] it is and there's opportunity. It's kind of like you were saying watching for the Fed to react isn't
[00:16:22] really where the news is today. It's where the news is what he's going to do in the future is what's
[00:16:28] the news today. In other words, when prices fall and everybody freaks out, it's really the best time
[00:16:35] to buy. So what we're talking about here is another opportunity that I want to encourage our agents
[00:16:41] to consider because right now we have a lot of clients that are sitting at two and a half,
[00:16:46] three percent mortgages. They don't want to move. They certainly don't want a six and a half percent
[00:16:50] mortgage to go from three to six and a half unless they have to. But I would say maybe they would
[00:16:57] want to do that if prices were low because not as many buyers are in their competing. So again,
[00:17:04] it's not going to be like this in every particular situation in every market. Certainly there's always
[00:17:08] buyers out there for the inventory that's there, but there's a lot less of them right now. So if it was
[00:17:14] me and I have a three percent mortgage and I don't want to give that up, of course, but I have to think
[00:17:20] about my future and I have to think about what I want to do and do I want to pay a premium when rates
[00:17:24] come down because now I have 20 other offers I have to beat in the market. I don't I wouldn't want
[00:17:30] to do that. I'd rather I'd rather eat it out now and pay a little bit more for however long I have
[00:17:37] to before I can refinance and get the deal I want and date the rate and marry the home, right? And
[00:17:43] I know that's not always the most comfortable conversation to have with someone because you're
[00:17:47] asking them to spend more money for something that they're currently getting a pretty good discount
[00:17:52] but it's a temporary discount even I mean unless you're going to stay there for 30 years then I
[00:17:56] guess it isn't but most people don't stay in their home that long you know for certainly first time
[00:18:00] home buyers aren't going to do that. So I think anyone who's bought a home in the last five years,
[00:18:06] the rate we know the values have gone up right. So you have an opportunity to say hey let's take some
[00:18:11] of the winnings I know it's going to suck because you're going to have to pay you know for something
[00:18:15] and you're going to get a loan that you're not going to love but you might get the place you want
[00:18:19] for a little bit of a discount today and we're going to refinance in a couple years anyway most likely.
[00:18:25] So I think we should be having that conversation curious to get your thoughts.
[00:18:30] Yeah it's um what I typically advise people is there's a lot of truth in what you just said right
[00:18:36] where the only thing that you lock in when you buy a home is the price that's the only thing that's
[00:18:42] guaranteed nothing else is guaranteed your insurance isn't guaranteed your property taxes isn't
[00:18:46] your interest rate isn't nothing's guaranteed because all those things are subject to change.
[00:18:51] The one thing that you do lock in is the purchase price you will never have to rebuy the house
[00:18:55] but you could refinance right now I want to be careful here because I've made a career over trying
[00:19:03] my best to give you know honest and the best advice I can and not be you know a pressure sales
[00:19:09] or a pitch right here's what I would say the house and always the advice that I give clients
[00:19:17] the house and the numbers have to work with who you are now and if they work better with who you
[00:19:23] are in the future that's a cherry on top but you now is the cake right and if it's hey Christian
[00:19:31] I'm buying this house and it will only work whether it's flexibility for you financially whether it's
[00:19:39] an investment in the future whatever if it will only work in the event you refinance I would say don't
[00:19:46] buy that property let's find a different one that's fine something that's a very strange way to know
[00:19:51] it may not be the golden goose right now but it will work now it's feasible you're not spending the
[00:20:01] negatively catchalling thousand it's not a sink right right if it's something that you can tolerate
[00:20:06] that you think is in you know and obviously everything else coming to play location and appreciation
[00:20:11] and you know value add that you may do right if the property has enough pros and in the future
[00:20:21] you take that seven percent down to a three and a half awesome but I always tell people expect
[00:20:27] to have the loan that you have now forever yeah but you won't nobody will all those people who got
[00:20:35] three percent interest rates in COVID I know it sounds crazy the vast majority of them will not have
[00:20:43] them in 25 years they won't they won't live there anymore yeah and everybody says I keep I'm
[00:20:49] going to keep my three percent rate till I die sure the average the average American I think I
[00:20:54] it's six percent of people I think keep there 30 year loans to maturity six percent of mortgages
[00:20:59] there's a 94 percent chance you're not all right um and those people who are in the six percent
[00:21:05] are the few that this is my forever home I'm never refinancing and I'm never moving okay that
[00:21:12] that is some people but it is more likely than not not the client you're working on right but
[00:21:18] it's important to advise people to know the upsides but also realize hey let's protect your
[00:21:24] financial security invest confidently invest defensively and ultimately make a decision that's
[00:21:30] going to push you forward not you know be the anchor at your heel right I want to yes agreed and
[00:21:36] I want to I got really excited we talked recently and you gave me an idea that I'm embarrassed to
[00:21:43] say I hadn't thought of and it was such a great idea that I told my girlfriend we are in the
[00:21:48] process of kind of moving our life forward and you know talking marriage and kids and all that
[00:21:53] and looking for a house together and and that kind of thing and sadly I would love to keep my home
[00:21:58] even if I had the ability I've a condo I would love to keep it and rent it out I don't think I'll be
[00:22:03] able to do that with the HOA rules so sadly as much as I would love to just you know keep that three
[00:22:08] percent for the next 30 years and have a renter in there I don't think that's probably going to happen
[00:22:12] unless I get super lucky so I'm going to have to give up that rate anyway but what I was really
[00:22:18] excited to hear from you was a strategy that I'm sure you're not the first person to say it but
[00:22:23] you were the first person to say it to me and I suspect most of our audience haven't heard it either
[00:22:28] was the strategy about and especially with the fact that our own 401k's or our set by arrays whatever
[00:22:34] we might have for retirement took a bit of a tumble or at least a roller coaster ride last few
[00:22:40] weeks and we got a little nervous and thank God I didn't have to retire three weeks ago that would
[00:22:44] have been our two weeks ago I would have I would have been pretty unhappy my dad is in the process
[00:22:49] of retiring this this July and so you know he's he's kind of sweating a little bit but he's
[00:22:55] very time to retire right now 100 percent it's a scary time to retire but you know but I did
[00:23:02] love your idea of buying a home a year and making an investment property rather not a primary
[00:23:10] residence every year but certainly buying an investment property a year and making that a
[00:23:15] retirement vehicle for you and I think not only is this a good opportunity for agents to consider
[00:23:21] for their own retirement because you know a lot of us don't have the opportunity to you know work
[00:23:27] at a corporation that provides 401k matching and things like that we're you know we're a little bit
[00:23:31] disincentivized to do that which you know just kind of the way it is being an independent contractor but
[00:23:37] we do have the opportunity to have a little bit more knowledge on the real estate investing side and
[00:23:44] I also want to make this point and I want to get Christians take before we talk about the strategy
[00:23:49] to sort of explain why it's so important to do this now and I was talking to a real estate journalist
[00:23:54] I have a guy on my show every month and Chris Chris is amazing and he talks a lot about what he thinks
[00:24:02] institutional investing buyers are doing these are black rock companies like that that we all hear
[00:24:07] about and they're buying up everything that we see and he believes that if you're not out there
[00:24:12] investing in the next five years they're going to have a good chunk of the inventory they just have
[00:24:18] that they have the cash they have the capital and the prices are good they are going to gobble up a
[00:24:24] lot of what is not going to then be available for you to consider investing in so he's like if you
[00:24:29] don't own a home now even a primary residence he's like I bet you're going to you're going to be
[00:24:34] renting in five years from a company like that now he may be wrong who knows but they're certainly
[00:24:39] very aggressively but purchasing so I want to then now with that knowledge and probably some urgency
[00:24:45] to consider first of all I want to get your take on that do you think the institutional buyers
[00:24:49] are gobbling up just a ton of inventory and do you see that being a problem for individual
[00:24:55] investors you know in the future of course it always could be but then I also want you to tell
[00:24:59] the strategy about how you could fund your retirement through real estate investing in a pretty
[00:25:05] simple process yeah yeah 100% answer them in order I would I would add an asterisk to the institutional
[00:25:13] conversation and I think there's an even bigger percentage of that people don't consider the black
[00:25:19] rocks and the state streets and the vanguards it is true they they did go on a buying spree of
[00:25:23] single-family homes and a lot of people have very adverse reactions to that and understandably so
[00:25:28] because black rock probably shouldn't be owning single-family homes right have them go by the huge
[00:25:32] 4,000 unit apartment complexes and whatever right however I think there's a bigger a bigger game at play here
[00:25:46] sorry once I can hear no problem
[00:25:51] we are a dog-friendly office as well so thankfully you're not hearing barking on my end only on
[00:25:57] Christians at the moment but it is not uncommon for us to hear barking in our office because we love
[00:26:02] dogs just as much as Christian does as well sorry about that guys he's not
[00:26:09] he's not okay so what I was saying is that I would say that exact same conversation is very
[00:26:18] important to discuss just remove institutional I think investors are gobbling up all the inventory
[00:26:23] he's like me people like David Green people you know and it's not it's not like I'm solo going to
[00:26:30] make an impact on the housing market right you mentioned on the intro you know I bought 15 homes
[00:26:35] in a year that that's great it's not like data moving numbers however a thousand ten thousand a
[00:26:43] hundred thousand Mies nationwide that's significant now people can call me the bad guy and you know
[00:26:49] landlord buying up all the real estate but in my opinion it's the only way to stay ahead right now
[00:26:54] that I can see I don't have a lick of confidence in the stock market I don't have a 401k I don't
[00:27:00] have an IRA I don't want one right if I told you guys that hey I have an investment for you you can't
[00:27:08] touch it until you're 65 and when you take out money you're going to be taxed a higher rate than your
[00:27:12] tax now well but it's tax-free growth tax-deferred growth come on you know so is real estate investing
[00:27:21] if you use the duxes correctly but I digress my my point is is that yes I think there is a wheat
[00:27:31] what we're witnessing is a mass consolidation of real estate ownership and I don't think it's just
[00:27:38] into the institutional buyers hands it's into your everyday investors hands and we talked about
[00:27:44] this on my first appearance on on here and I implore the listeners to do a little thought exercise
[00:27:50] go back to your childhood 20 30 40 50 years ago whatever go back to when you were a kid how many
[00:27:56] people did you know that owned multiple houses zero maybe somebody with that maybe somebody with a
[00:28:04] a home if they were wealthy they had a vacation home somewhere they weren't renting it out that was
[00:28:09] about it they had like a lake that was that was it yeah or like a ski cabin up in the mountains right like
[00:28:15] real grandma was it was being rented yeah it was just sitting there dormant a cabin in the woods
[00:28:20] kind of thing yeah that's exactly right now compared to today you can probably name 10 people without
[00:28:28] even given much of thought to it of who owned multiple houses right that's what we're experiencing
[00:28:33] where I think there is a movement from 30 years ago first time home buyers were the primary
[00:28:41] movement you know the moving force in the industry and it's really really really started to pivot
[00:28:47] towards investors and I would like to get it back towards first time home buyers because I think
[00:28:51] people need to buy real estate like just fundamentally speaking in the American economy the way that
[00:28:56] we're structured with the way the tax code is like god guys if you don't like paying taxes buy real
[00:29:02] estate please by real estate it is it is so unfairly in real estate investors favors the tax code
[00:29:10] the entirety of the the whole tax code everything else sucks right investing in stocks sucks capital
[00:29:18] game stocks income tax sucks property tax sucks everything else sucks except investing in real estate
[00:29:24] it's like the only thing that is can possibly be fully shielded from taxes right um it's serious
[00:29:31] guys go read the tax code if you don't believe me ask Donald Trump how he became president he
[00:29:35] Donald Trump became president on the heels of real estate yeah real estate got him there right
[00:29:42] regardless of your opinion of him that's a fact right um your second question kind of pivoting
[00:29:49] that on that topic of investing in real estate my my strategy and I'll be quick because on my previous
[00:29:56] episode yeah I know we went dove in a detail but the process is if you were to take the money
[00:30:02] that you would put into a retirement account your you know whatever if you have household family
[00:30:08] income two people making 50k a year you got 100k and household income you're probably putting 15k
[00:30:13] into a 401k right together both of you can buy 15% of your income maybe last but we'll just use that
[00:30:22] number if you were to instead take that and buy a new home once a year and I would even argue like
[00:30:29] make it your primary right like when you're young move around a bit right when you when you can be
[00:30:35] a little uncomfortable right put 5% down of a what 500k house 5% is 25 grand we'll even take it down
[00:30:45] 5% of a 300k house that will buy most you know a lot of property in a lot of markets in America
[00:30:50] Los Angeles we're gonna have to talk about up and get but you know different places different openings
[00:30:55] right um and if you have an opportunity and opening to come in at at 300k put 15% down 15k
[00:31:04] down I'm sorry 3% that's 5% and do it once again next year the reason why I say once a year is
[00:31:11] because that's when you can buy a new primary and keep the old one yeah and if you're targeting
[00:31:17] properties that rent for similar to the mortgage payment if I have a $2,000 a month mortgage
[00:31:22] make sure that bad boy rents for a $2,100 bucks a month whatever just breaks even
[00:31:28] and then play us out with me in five years you have five properties there's no cash flow
[00:31:33] you're just paying your expenses there's no cash flow and this is money that would be in your
[00:31:37] 401k otherwise well but a lot of tax deductions along the way 100% a lot of tax deductions a lot of
[00:31:43] unspoken benefits there and if you just experience normal market appreciation 3 to 5% a year
[00:31:51] scale that out for 30 years that $300,000 home is going to be worth a million in 30 years
[00:31:57] pretty straightforward if you guys go back to the 70s look at what the average price point is
[00:32:03] America I think in the 70s it was like 38,000 was the average single family home price
[00:32:08] something crazy now it's like 4 4 30 I think 3 90 something like that
[00:32:15] but if you fast forward to your first year of retirement assuming you finance these on 30 year
[00:32:21] traditional mortgages which is possible your first year of retirement is 30 years after you
[00:32:28] bought your first time imagine you work for 30 years you work from you know 25 to 55 right at your
[00:32:35] 55 that house that you bought at 25 is now paid off because of your 30 years later you paid it off
[00:32:42] and you never refinanced I'm just making this easy for example well what do you what do you have
[00:32:47] what's your net worth well oh the 401k Christian at that point in time I can start taking monthly
[00:32:52] distributions and after 30 years of contributing I can distribute uh $3,000 a month comfortably
[00:33:00] okay awesome retirement plan you're going to be comfortable 30 years from now with a re-grant of
[00:33:07] months right you sure right you sure we don't want to get a little more comfortable in that like
[00:33:13] you I mean you might be able to live but you're going to be you want to be on a fixed income I don't
[00:33:18] right I want to be comfortable when I retire like I want to go be traveling and have kids and I
[00:33:22] can support and like have some some fun in life right reap the the rewards of what you sowed a
[00:33:36] little boy um but it's staying in seriousness here at the end of that 30 year period now that rent
[00:33:46] that you initially rented out for 21 hundred bucks a month it's renting for like four grand now
[00:33:51] because 30 years of rent to remember people forget the property appreciates the soda's the rent
[00:33:55] the rental income goes up and even during times of crisis recessions you guys go look at the data of
[00:34:03] what happened to rent in 2008 real estate houses prices went down yeah but rent went up it actually
[00:34:11] got more expensive so now I'm netting for four k a month from just that property and let's just say
[00:34:17] there's one k of upkeep you have to put in every single month because it's 30 years old let's just
[00:34:23] say that and that's probably not what you would have to put in but even then now you're netting three k
[00:34:28] but now fast-forwarding and let's say oh I don't want that three k months because that was comparable
[00:34:33] with 401k what I'd say is hey on year 30 you now have a million dollar asset right 30 years of
[00:34:40] appreciation on three hundred thousand dollar house that has no debt number one you could sell it
[00:34:45] if you want boom you get a million dollars in income your first year of retirement oh you before
[00:34:50] one k is not gonna do that for you or what I think is more powerful number two you go leverage it
[00:34:55] I take that million dollar loan and I go put a six hundred thousand dollar mortgage on it
[00:35:00] and I scale that mortgage to what the rent will still support and I make it break even again
[00:35:05] and let's say that's five hundred grand five hundred grand with a four thousand dollar monthly
[00:35:08] payment that means in your first year of retirement you took three thousand dollars a month that
[00:35:15] we were cash flowing or four thousand whatever and you converted it to a five hundred thousand dollar
[00:35:20] deposit tax-free in your first year of retirement now we were talking about living on three grand a
[00:35:30] month can you live on five hundred k your first year of retirement I think so right and then
[00:35:39] you have another property coming to the next year that's exactly right every 30 years you're just
[00:35:43] staggered so in your your house you bought in year two is now you're refined your 31 your three
[00:35:49] is your 32 right and you just do it it literally is a retirement subsidy and guess what when you
[00:35:55] eventually pass away you sure on a 401k your kid would inherit it you know whatever
[00:36:01] but with real estate your kid inherits the plan which means 30 years later they can be refinancing
[00:36:09] every year right and they can use the proceeds from what you bought and they can go buy themselves
[00:36:15] and you can just start snowballing right and this is how people end with 30 40 50 60 70 properties
[00:36:24] this is how they do it it's not rocket science it's it's a strategy that is actually achievable
[00:36:30] because most people will go out there and say make more money because you got to put 20%
[00:36:33] down to buy each property that's hard with property values where they are now the average house price
[00:36:38] in America is around four hundred grand 20% is eighty thousand dollars ninety nine percent of Americans are
[00:36:43] not saving 80 grand a year that's not gonna happen but can you say 15 maybe much more positive yeah right
[00:36:52] I love that and that strategy is so powerful it's it's a great great idea my girlfriend and I
[00:36:59] figured out how much we can save each year with our income and it's assuming we you know are both
[00:37:05] gainfully employed so I hope that that that can continue because that's what we need to do
[00:37:10] in order to fund our retirement in the way that we want because again yeah maybe the maybe the
[00:37:16] and again the stock market traditionally rises over time too it's it's certainly not the worst play
[00:37:20] but you you aren't really building generational wealth at that point I mean I guess if you don't touch
[00:37:27] it you give pass it off to your kids maybe but you're not building an asset that's first of all
[00:37:31] the other thing too about primary residence if you don't have investment investment accounts
[00:37:36] it's not really an asset your primary home I don't believe is really an asset until the day
[00:37:41] you sell it otherwise it's just I mean you gotta you gotta live somewhere right so you gotta live
[00:37:46] somewhere and people often think well I have this asset I'm sitting on this asset it's like not
[00:37:50] really unless you're downsizing like guess maybe yeah you know you need to pull some money out of it
[00:37:54] otherwise you're just living where you're living and so for those of us that are living in areas where
[00:38:00] like LA where we can't necessarily 15k isn't maybe going to get us the ability for us to move
[00:38:07] around each year for a while and take advantage that way so we need to look in other parts of the
[00:38:12] country where we aren't going to be able to live there because we live in somewhere else but we
[00:38:16] can still employ the same strategy really anywhere correct that's correct yeah and obviously you know
[00:38:22] the purchase prices in your areas and the scale but so should your income right if you're living
[00:38:26] in San Francisco your income should be higher than if you lived in Louisiana right and that's
[00:38:32] nothing against Louisiana that's just the fact right I mean different markets cost more so you know
[00:38:38] and one a year may not be possible maybe you do one every two years maybe you do one every three
[00:38:42] years but getting it on your on your radar to understand the possibilities that it unlocks
[00:38:53] utilizing a strategy like this and how it can replace what traditionally has been told to us is like
[00:38:58] detried and true investing method in America which is the 401k right and ira's and you know whatever
[00:39:05] they're all investing in stocks right but I got a little puppy going crazy here you guys but uh
[00:39:12] you know I just think it brings a different level of thinking it's funner because I mean I don't
[00:39:20] do you guys but I get more excited investing in real estate than I do buying Apple stock
[00:39:25] Apple stock definitely like oh they're releasing the new iPhone no way it looks the same as last
[00:39:31] years and you don't have as much agency over the investment either you don't have as much control
[00:39:38] over what that investment does because you can beautify the property you can make it more appealing
[00:39:43] there are things you can do to increase the value of that rent of that rental of the building
[00:39:50] itself and you know it's there's a sense of ownership and pride too in this I am building something
[00:39:58] that again you know it's funny I've never well I guess I could make an exception to this that
[00:40:04] during the mortgage mortgage crash in 2008 and in 2009 that was a different situation because those
[00:40:11] were a lot of loans that just shouldn't have been written and people who shouldn't have been getting
[00:40:16] those loans that that is not going to happen again what we hope because certainly um you know
[00:40:20] banks have learned their lesson but I can tell you being in the industry it is a nightmare getting
[00:40:26] somebody alone it is so hard to get alone that I don't believe another 2008 to have and unless
[00:40:31] we just slash all regulations which maybe happens I hope it does not um yeah but it is it is
[00:40:38] incredibly difficult to get a loan nowadays um that in 2008 is it intrinsically impossible to
[00:40:46] happen the way the system is currently structured it's just impossible we we can't have a scenario
[00:40:52] like that take place again now we get out like an auto loan crash or different things like that and
[00:40:56] that maybe what we can discuss on future episodes but um we will not have another real estate bubble
[00:41:01] it just it can't happen with the way that financing is structured nowadays
[00:41:06] so I was thinking that I've know a lot of people that own multiple investment properties I have
[00:41:12] not heard one of them and again post that time when maybe people were getting loans they shouldn't
[00:41:17] have um or they shouldn't have been able to rather not that they shouldn't have shouldn't have
[00:41:21] been able to and I've not heard one person say boy that was a bad idea of investing in
[00:41:26] and multi-family or you know income based I literally haven't met one person who said that
[00:41:34] now of course not every investment is a good idea but it I mean my brother-in-law has a property
[00:41:41] in Tampa he bought it for gosh 130 thousand dollars it's right across from the stadium he
[00:41:47] rents it out to mostly to people who short-term rentals people that want to watch the game
[00:41:52] you know during football season concerts he rents it out short-term rentals he only has to rent it
[00:41:57] out like 10 days a month to make you know to make his nut and he makes thousands of dollars in
[00:42:04] in net revenue every single month from like a hundred and thirty thousand dollar purchase
[00:42:09] it's never going to appreciate to any massive level but is great regular income and one day you
[00:42:15] know who knows maybe it will be worth something more but regardless um it's it's it's kind of saved
[00:42:20] because you know there was a little time when he was in between jobs and he was like oh shoot you
[00:42:25] know I don't you know I don't oh no I do have income coming in you know every month so that's
[00:42:29] another reason to kind of keep it in mind is you know as long as uh he purchased it outright because
[00:42:34] he had the ability to do that so he didn't have to worry about a mortgage payment so I guess he
[00:42:38] didn't really have a nut so to speak but but he he was paying himself back and it's been a wonderful
[00:42:43] investment for him and anyway again we all know people that have done this and they rarely are
[00:42:48] you know unless they just mispriced it and their rental prices isn't where it could be and you
[00:42:55] know what who knows everyone can buy a lemon but if you do your research this is a pretty solid idea
[00:43:01] so um I think you know and you and David are kind of some of the biggest industry voices to sort of
[00:43:08] give the strategy away and also you know we want our audience to to to check you guys out as well
[00:43:15] because you guys have your own your own mortgage lending brokerage which is really exciting after so
[00:43:21] many years of being in the industry and it's just been crushing it the the one brokerage is where
[00:43:25] like everybody to go so for your traditional clients the traditional you know a primary home resident
[00:43:30] buyers or self buyers rather um I want you to go to the one brokerage.com give David and Christian
[00:43:36] an opportunity to earn that business but also let's start talking about investment strategies to our
[00:43:42] primary home buyers and sellers right the people that are only putting stuff into 401k's have
[00:43:48] these conversations you know get Christian and David to talk with them as well and their team they
[00:43:53] will help them guide them through this process this is really an amazing idea that I want our audience
[00:43:59] to deeply consider from a tax perspective and also a retirement perspective it is something that
[00:44:05] just doesn't even today doesn't give as get as much press and as it should um and you know it's uh
[00:44:12] there's a lot of bad information out there too so absolutely yeah 100% and there's you know you
[00:44:18] guys have to be careful about it because unless unless somebody is doing it themselves providing a
[00:44:23] service you know repeatable source you have to be careful there's a lot of people claiming they can do
[00:44:27] a lot of stuff right I'm still here and all the time that you can buy real estate with no money down
[00:44:31] and sure there's wholesaling subject to and creative financing be careful right it's what that's
[00:44:38] that you know it's it's not the people putting 20% down they get slammed right it's not the people
[00:44:42] investing confidently buying a primary every year making sure that it rents well afterwards it's not
[00:44:47] those people getting slammed it's the people trying to skip steps find the easy path there's no um
[00:44:54] there's no secret sauce right it's it's hard work it's fundamentals and it's it's confident and
[00:45:00] and defensive investing that gets you ahead um
[00:45:06] somebody may get watery but if you buy tickets your whole life you're gonna come out below right
[00:45:12] you're gonna you're not gonna come out on top right right yeah super well said and great

By the way, if you don't know Christian and David, they became super well known on a great site called Bigger Pockets, which is a place where typically people learn about how to become real estate investors. It's the largest form in the in the country and they became very, very popular there.

Christian is a UC Berkeley grad. He has a bachelor's in chemical engineering, but he hated that industry and wanted to get out of cap turning potential. He got into real estate with the help of a childhood family friend and had some success in the business and discovered he had a knack for connecting with people and adding value to their mindsets, investments, and journeys. He's a licensed real estate, insurance and mortgage broker. Batchelder regularly hosts mastermind seminars and webinars with real estate gurus.

I appreciate all the kind words and if anybody out there is listening and does want to take a peek by our website or obviously talk with me individually for your next deal, whether it's for you or your clients, I'd love to help. Give me a shout at any time. Yeah, this guy is an actual legend in not only the real estate investing space, but the loan space and also the real estate broker space. He is kind of a Renaissance man in this industry well known. It's kind of a celebrity and we're super lucky to have him and he is coming to us all the way from LA, which we are excited to chat with them about. So Christian, I know a lot of agents these days. It's tough market out there. It's tough inventory's low. Rates are a little bit higher than anyone would probably prefer, but still not too bad. But we're having certainly seeing a lot of news out there with the Fed. I saw today, Trump said he is not interested in firing Powell the head of the Fed, but we'll see what happens. Of course, his opinions in mind changes seemingly day to day, but certainly the market responded. I saw the Dow did well today, which is exciting. So it looks like at least the equity markets are responding favorably, but of course, as REALTOR as we want to know about rates for our buyer clients who are sitting on the sidelines. So again, nobody has a crystal ball, but what's your take on everything that's going on? Very interesting, very tough to predict. And coming from me, that means a lot as somebody who is ridiculously studied in the industry. I literally have made a career of obviously giving advice and educating. And obviously the most common question that I get is where rates go. That's what everybody wants to talk to a lender about. What a rate? What can I get my debt at? And if you're in escrow, it's when should I lock my rate? Are they going up? Are they going down? What should I do to compensate for? But what's the best direction I need to take? And I will tell you these last three, four weeks have been the hardest time period to advise since I've been in the industry, which is a decade plus now at this point. Gosh, 15, 17 years, something, no? Great. 15 years, I think I got my first like intern job in the industry. But still, regardless, harder than COVID when the whole world thought it was shutting down, right? And it was not this difficult to predict rates. Now, granted it COVID, everybody was happy with the rate. We were talking about a 2% go into a 3%. Now, obviously, with the rates being where they are, it's a little different. But what I will say to just give a general standpoint is really what I'd like to convey to the audience in this episode is helping you guys understand not only what the market does, but understand how in the background, what is eventually leading to these rates? What's leading to the increases? What's leading to the decreases? What is impacting them? It's not really what you would think. A lot of people await for Jerome Powell to come out and his monthly press conference say we're raising or lowering rates. And they say, whoo, market rates are cheaper or more expensive. It's not true. And, you know, I mean, you were talking earlier and we said, you know, hey, why is it, you know, when the fed cuts rates, there's not always a one-to-one correlation, right? With market rates coming down. And we're going to get into that today in detail and give you guys a little more concrete understanding behind the scenes. And most importantly, give you guys some good content to use on your calls with your clients. Yeah, let's dive in. So, right now, there's a lot of uncertainty. The stock market has certainly been up and down and some values gone out. It's come back. And, you know, we're just consumer confidence is kind of in a strange place. And the banks aren't totally sure what to do. I think. And so, you know, what are you seeing out there? Yeah, uncertainty. Let me, let me give you guys a gist of what actually happens here. Let's just use tariffs as an example because that's our common current event right now. When Trump first announced them, the stock market dropped significantly. And I'm talking, you know, it was, it was like four to six percent for like three straight days. Because I remember it happened on a Wednesday. It was Wednesday Thursday Friday, three runner, runner, and other days where we were talking recession. Everybody was on fire and it's like, now, the mortgage rates did great. Over those three days, we dropped about a full percent in mortgage rates. We were hovering around to 6.9 when it started. Just as your average 30-year conventional rate. And we actually got down to like six and a quarter. So almost, you know, 0.75, you know, getting close to a full percent drop. In the course of three days, that's like incredible movement. Now, why does that happen? A lot of people can say, oh, well, the mortgage market and securities, which is the stock market, a lot of times people say in, in, in, incorrectly, but they say commonly that they move inversely to each other, right? So if the stock market goes down, mortgage rates will, will get better, right? You know, which means lower in our, in our case. Now, the reason why that is is because of how the, the investing kind of infrastructure works in America. When money is retracted from the stock market, obviously that will lead to decreasing stock prices, right? There's less buyers, which means that they're not as much demand. So they have to drop prices in order to incentivize. When money exits stocks, Facebook, Amazon, Apple, whatever, it needs somewhere to go. And historically, and somewhat traditionally, that money will typically retreat into the bond market. Now, so you guys understand bonds. It's basically government debt and mortgage back securities are a form of them, right? So when they enter the bonds, leave the securities market, securities of stocks and enter the bonds market, that typically has a downward pressure on interest rates. And let me say this in a way that is super easy to understand, and you guys can, can kind of copy and paste this conversation with your clients and you sound super smart, right? Say securities and bonds and all these fancy words, right? So as money floods into the bonds market, there's now more buyers. So consider this like your house, right? The bond market is your house that you're making an offer on. Imagine you went from having one buyer where you're probably going to get bid down and get an undervalue offer, right? And now you have 15 buyers. Everybody scrambling. It's COVID 2020 all over again, right? Every house has 25 offers on that's what happens when money floods into the bond market. So because of that, because there's an influx of buyers, the rates can think of it this way, the people issuing the bonds can get a better deal, which means they don't have to pay as much return, right? Because more people want them. So it's inverted because a better return is a higher rate, but that's worse for us. So being a less strong investment to the person buying the debt, I want to make sure I'm being clear here because this gets a little complicated. They can drive the rates down because they don't have to pay as high as a return, okay? So typically when something like what happened a few weeks ago happens, the rates will do great. And they did for three days. The problem is that money did not flood into the bond market. And this really diverged from what the expectation was. So what happened is all this money retreated from the stock market and banks prepared, they dropped all their rates because they expected that money to flood into the bond market and it didn't really happen. So if you follow and you track the 10-year treasury, which is a rough correlation of where mortgage rates are, you'll be able to see a huge drop for three days and then a huge spike up. And now we're actually sitting higher than we were before. The reason being, the buyers didn't come. So you guys list the equivalent to this is you guys listed your property at a super low price because you were expecting to inside a bidding war and it didn't happen. The buyers didn't come. Now you're sitting there with the house that's under listed and the buyers and the sellers mad. What do you do? You kind of showed all your cards, you got put it out there and you made a miscalculation. That's what banks did a bond to actions they respond to news. So for instance, when Jerome Powell comes out and just for Reverend Jerome Powell is the head of the US Fed, he's the chair of the Fed. He comes out and he's the one who kind of determines the monetary policy in America. When he comes out and he says, hey guys, great news, we're going to drop rates. The banks knew he was going to say that three months earlier. They already made their adjustments. Let me give you an example of what could have. He could say, hey guys, we're going to drop rates this month but our next six month period were anticipating increasing rates twice. If this would be a super rare scenario because he wouldn't drop and then immediately re-raise. But let's just imagine it was on that day where Jerome Powell dropped rates, mortgage rates would actually go up because the banks would be pricing in those future two increases. So that's where people don't really understand that they just sit there and wait for Jerome Powell to say what he's going to say and you're listening to the wrong part of the conversation. You should be listening to what he says is coming not what he's doing today. That will impact mortgage rates. Give you a little background. Yeah, that was a mouthful but that's a five minute run down of the of the bond market in America. No, I love it. It's super helpful. And also we should remember too that rates are always something that obviously are beyond our control and also just kind of is what it is and there's opportunity. It's kind of like you were saying watching for the Fed to react isn't really where the news is today. It's where the news is what he's going to do in the future is what's the news today. In other words, when prices fall and everybody freaks out, it's really the best time to buy. So what we're talking about here is another opportunity that I want to encourage our agents to consider because right now we have a lot of clients that are sitting at two and a half, three percent mortgages. They don't want to move. They certainly don't want a six and a half percent mortgage to go from three to six and a half unless they have to. But I would say maybe they would want to do that if prices were low because not as many buyers are in their competing. So again, it's not going to be like this in every particular situation in every market. Certainly there's always buyers out there for the inventory that's there, but there's a lot less of them right now. So if it was me and I have a three percent mortgage and I don't want to give that up, of course, but I have to think about my future and I have to think about what I want to do and do I want to pay a premium when rates come down because now I have 20 other offers I have to beat in the market. I don't I wouldn't want to do that. I'd rather I'd rather eat it out now and pay a little bit more for however long I have to before I can refinance and get the deal I want and date the rate and marry the home, right? And I know that's not always the most comfortable conversation to have with someone because you're asking them to spend more money for something that they're currently getting a pretty good discount but it's a temporary discount even I mean unless you're going to stay there for 30 years then I guess it isn't but most people don't stay in their home that long you know for certainly first time home buyers aren't going to do that. So I think anyone who's bought a home in the last five years, the rate we know the values have gone up right. So you have an opportunity to say hey let's take some of the winnings I know it's going to suck because you're going to have to pay you know for something and you're going to get a loan that you're not going to love but you might get the place you want for a little bit of a discount today and we're going to refinance in a couple years anyway most likely. So I think we should be having that conversation curious to get your thoughts. Yeah it's um what I typically advise people is there's a lot of truth in what you just said right where the only thing that you lock in when you buy a home is the price that's the only thing that's guaranteed nothing else is guaranteed your insurance isn't guaranteed your property taxes isn't your interest rate isn't nothing's guaranteed because all those things are subject to change. The one thing that you do lock in is the purchase price you will never have to rebuy the house but you could refinance right now I want to be careful here because I've made a career over trying my best to give you know honest and the best advice I can and not be you know a pressure sales or a pitch right here's what I would say the house and always the advice that I give clients the house and the numbers have to work with who you are now and if they work better with who you are in the future that's a cherry on top but you now is the cake right and if it's hey Christian I'm buying this house and it will only work whether it's flexibility for you financially whether it's an investment in the future whatever if it will only work in the event you refinance I would say don't buy that property let's find a different one that's fine something that's a very strange way to know it may not be the golden goose right now but it will work now it's feasible you're not spending the negatively catchalling thousand it's not a sink right right if it's something that you can tolerate that you think is in you know and obviously everything else coming to play location and appreciation and you know value add that you may do right if the property has enough pros and in the future you take that seven percent down to a three and a half awesome but I always tell people expect to have the loan that you have now forever yeah but you won't nobody will all those people who got three percent interest rates in COVID I know it sounds crazy the vast majority of them will not have them in 25 years they won't they won't live there anymore yeah and everybody says I keep I'm going to keep my three percent rate till I die sure the average the average American I think I it's six percent of people I think keep there 30 year loans to maturity six percent of mortgages there's a 94 percent chance you're not all right um and those people who are in the six percent are the few that this is my forever home I'm never refinancing and I'm never moving okay that that is some people but it is more likely than not not the client you're working on right but it's important to advise people to know the upsides but also realize hey let's protect your financial security invest confidently invest defensively and ultimately make a decision that's going to push you forward not you know be the anchor at your heel right I want to yes agreed and I want to I got really excited we talked recently and you gave me an idea that I'm embarrassed to say I hadn't thought of and it was such a great idea that I told my girlfriend we are in the process of kind of moving our life forward and you know talking marriage and kids and all that and looking for a house together and and that kind of thing and sadly I would love to keep my home even if I had the ability I've a condo I would love to keep it and rent it out I don't think I'll be able to do that with the HOA rules so sadly as much as I would love to just you know keep that three percent for the next 30 years and have a renter in there I don't think that's probably going to happen unless I get super lucky so I'm going to have to give up that rate anyway but what I was really excited to hear from you was a strategy that I'm sure you're not the first person to say it but you were the first person to say it to me and I suspect most of our audience haven't heard it either was the strategy about and especially with the fact that our own 401k's or our set by arrays whatever we might have for retirement took a bit of a tumble or at least a roller coaster ride last few weeks and we got a little nervous and thank God I didn't have to retire three weeks ago that would have been our two weeks ago I would have I would have been pretty unhappy my dad is in the process of retiring this this July and so you know he's he's kind of sweating a little bit but he's very time to retire right now 100 percent it's a scary time to retire but you know but I did love your idea of buying a home a year and making an investment property rather not a primary residence every year but certainly buying an investment property a year and making that a retirement vehicle for you and I think not only is this a good opportunity for agents to consider for their own retirement because you know a lot of us don't have the opportunity to you know work at a corporation that provides 401k matching and things like that we're you know we're a little bit disincentivized to do that which you know just kind of the way it is being an independent contractor but we do have the opportunity to have a little bit more knowledge on the real estate investing side and I also want to make this point and I want to get Christians take before we talk about the strategy to sort of explain why it's so important to do this now and I was talking to a real estate journalist I have a guy on my show every month and Chris Chris is amazing and he talks a lot about what he thinks institutional investing buyers are doing these are black rock companies like that that we all hear about and they're buying up everything that we see and he believes that if you're not out there investing in the next five years they're going to have a good chunk of the inventory they just have that they have the cash they have the capital and the prices are good they are going to gobble up a lot of what is not going to then be available for you to consider investing in so he's like if you don't own a home now even a primary residence he's like I bet you're going to you're going to be renting in five years from a company like that now he may be wrong who knows but they're certainly very aggressively but purchasing so I want to then now with that knowledge and probably some urgency to consider first of all I want to get your take on that do you think the institutional buyers are gobbling up just a ton of inventory and do you see that being a problem for individual investors you know in the future of course it always could be but then I also want you to tell the strategy about how you could fund your retirement through real estate investing in a pretty simple process yeah yeah 100% answer them in order I would I would add an asterisk to the institutional conversation and I think there's an even bigger percentage of that people don't consider the black rocks and the state streets and the vanguards it is true they they did go on a buying spree of single-family homes and a lot of people have very adverse reactions to that and understandably so because black rock probably shouldn't be owning single-family homes right have them go by the huge 4,000 unit apartment complexes and whatever right however I think there's a bigger a bigger game at play here sorry once I can hear no problem we are a dog-friendly office as well so thankfully you're not hearing barking on my end only on Christians at the moment but it is not uncommon for us to hear barking in our office because we love dogs just as much as Christian does as well sorry about that guys he's not he's not okay so what I was saying is that I would say that exact same conversation is very important to discuss just remove institutional I think investors are gobbling up all the inventory he's like me people like David Green people you know and it's not it's not like I'm solo going to make an impact on the housing market right you mentioned on the intro you know I bought 15 homes in a year that that's great it's not like data moving numbers however a thousand ten thousand a hundred thousand Mies nationwide that's significant now people can call me the bad guy and you know landlord buying up all the real estate but in my opinion it's the only way to stay ahead right now that I can see I don't have a lick of confidence in the stock market I don't have a 401k I don't have an IRA I don't want one right if I told you guys that hey I have an investment for you you can't touch it until you're 65 and when you take out money you're going to be taxed a higher rate than your tax now well but it's tax-free growth tax-deferred growth come on you know so is real estate investing if you use the duxes correctly but I digress my my point is is that yes I think there is a wheat what we're witnessing is a mass consolidation of real estate ownership and I don't think it's just into the institutional buyers hands it's into your everyday investors hands and we talked about this on my first appearance on on here and I implore the listeners to do a little thought exercise go back to your childhood 20 30 40 50 years ago whatever go back to when you were a kid how many people did you know that owned multiple houses zero maybe somebody with that maybe somebody with a a home if they were wealthy they had a vacation home somewhere they weren't renting it out that was about it they had like a lake that was that was it yeah or like a ski cabin up in the mountains right like real grandma was it was being rented yeah it was just sitting there dormant a cabin in the woods kind of thing yeah that's exactly right now compared to today you can probably name 10 people without even given much of thought to it of who owned multiple houses right that's what we're experiencing where I think there is a movement from 30 years ago first time home buyers were the primary movement you know the moving force in the industry and it's really really really started to pivot towards investors and I would like to get it back towards first time home buyers because I think people need to buy real estate like just fundamentally speaking in the American economy the way that we're structured with the way the tax code is like god guys if you don't like paying taxes buy real estate please by real estate it is it is so unfairly in real estate investors favors the tax code the entirety of the the whole tax code everything else sucks right investing in stocks sucks capital game stocks income tax sucks property tax sucks everything else sucks except investing in real estate it's like the only thing that is can possibly be fully shielded from taxes right um it's serious guys go read the tax code if you don't believe me ask Donald Trump how he became president he Donald Trump became president on the heels of real estate yeah real estate got him there right regardless of your opinion of him that's a fact right um your second question kind of pivoting that on that topic of investing in real estate my my strategy and I'll be quick because on my previous episode yeah I know we went dove in a detail but the process is if you were to take the money that you would put into a retirement account your you know whatever if you have household family income two people making 50k a year you got 100k and household income you're probably putting 15k into a 401k right together both of you can buy 15% of your income maybe last but we'll just use that number if you were to instead take that and buy a new home once a year and I would even argue like make it your primary right like when you're young move around a bit right when you when you can be a little uncomfortable right put 5% down of a what 500k house 5% is 25 grand we'll even take it down 5% of a 300k house that will buy most you know a lot of property in a lot of markets in America Los Angeles we're gonna have to talk about up and get but you know different places different openings right um and if you have an opportunity and opening to come in at at 300k put 15% down 15k down I'm sorry 3% that's 5% and do it once again next year the reason why I say once a year is because that's when you can buy a new primary and keep the old one yeah and if you're targeting properties that rent for similar to the mortgage payment if I have a $2,000 a month mortgage make sure that bad boy rents for a $2,100 bucks a month whatever just breaks even and then play us out with me in five years you have five properties there's no cash flow you're just paying your expenses there's no cash flow and this is money that would be in your 401k otherwise well but a lot of tax deductions along the way 100% a lot of tax deductions a lot of unspoken benefits there and if you just experience normal market appreciation 3 to 5% a year scale that out for 30 years that $300,000 home is going to be worth a million in 30 years pretty straightforward if you guys go back to the 70s look at what the average price point is America I think in the 70s it was like 38,000 was the average single family home price something crazy now it's like 4 4 30 I think 3 90 something like that but if you fast forward to your first year of retirement assuming you finance these on 30 year traditional mortgages which is possible your first year of retirement is 30 years after you bought your first time imagine you work for 30 years you work from you know 25 to 55 right at your 55 that house that you bought at 25 is now paid off because of your 30 years later you paid it off and you never refinanced I'm just making this easy for example well what do you what do you have what's your net worth well oh the 401k Christian at that point in time I can start taking monthly distributions and after 30 years of contributing I can distribute uh $3,000 a month comfortably okay awesome retirement plan you're going to be comfortable 30 years from now with a re-grant of months right you sure right you sure we don't want to get a little more comfortable in that like you I mean you might be able to live but you're going to be you want to be on a fixed income I don't right I want to be comfortable when I retire like I want to go be traveling and have kids and I can support and like have some some fun in life right reap the the rewards of what you sowed a little boy um but it's staying in seriousness here at the end of that 30 year period now that rent that you initially rented out for 21 hundred bucks a month it's renting for like four grand now because 30 years of rent to remember people forget the property appreciates the soda's the rent the rental income goes up and even during times of crisis recessions you guys go look at the data of what happened to rent in 2008 real estate houses prices went down yeah but rent went up it actually got more expensive so now I'm netting for four k a month from just that property and let's just say there's one k of upkeep you have to put in every single month because it's 30 years old let's just say that and that's probably not what you would have to put in but even then now you're netting three k but now fast-forwarding and let's say oh I don't want that three k months because that was comparable with 401k what I'd say is hey on year 30 you now have a million dollar asset right 30 years of appreciation on three hundred thousand dollar house that has no debt number one you could sell it if you want boom you get a million dollars in income your first year of retirement oh you before one k is not gonna do that for you or what I think is more powerful number two you go leverage it I take that million dollar loan and I go put a six hundred thousand dollar mortgage on it and I scale that mortgage to what the rent will still support and I make it break even again and let's say that's five hundred grand five hundred grand with a four thousand dollar monthly payment that means in your first year of retirement you took three thousand dollars a month that we were cash flowing or four thousand whatever and you converted it to a five hundred thousand dollar deposit tax-free in your first year of retirement now we were talking about living on three grand a month can you live on five hundred k your first year of retirement I think so right and then you have another property coming to the next year that's exactly right every 30 years you're just staggered so in your your house you bought in year two is now you're refined your 31 your three is your 32 right and you just do it it literally is a retirement subsidy and guess what when you eventually pass away you sure on a 401k your kid would inherit it you know whatever but with real estate your kid inherits the plan which means 30 years later they can be refinancing every year right and they can use the proceeds from what you bought and they can go buy themselves and you can just start snowballing right and this is how people end with 30 40 50 60 70 properties this is how they do it it's not rocket science it's it's a strategy that is actually achievable because most people will go out there and say make more money because you got to put 20% down to buy each property that's hard with property values where they are now the average house price in America is around four hundred grand 20% is eighty thousand dollars ninety nine percent of Americans are not saving 80 grand a year that's not gonna happen but can you say 15 maybe much more positive yeah right I love that and that strategy is so powerful it's it's a great great idea my girlfriend and I figured out how much we can save each year with our income and it's assuming we you know are both gainfully employed so I hope that that that can continue because that's what we need to do in order to fund our retirement in the way that we want because again yeah maybe the maybe the and again the stock market traditionally rises over time too it's it's certainly not the worst play but you you aren't really building generational wealth at that point I mean I guess if you don't touch it you give pass it off to your kids maybe but you're not building an asset that's first of all the other thing too about primary residence if you don't have investment investment accounts it's not really an asset your primary home I don't believe is really an asset until the day you sell it otherwise it's just I mean you gotta you gotta live somewhere right so you gotta live somewhere and people often think well I have this asset I'm sitting on this asset it's like not really unless you're downsizing like guess maybe yeah you know you need to pull some money out of it otherwise you're just living where you're living and so for those of us that are living in areas where like LA where we can't necessarily 15k isn't maybe going to get us the ability for us to move around each year for a while and take advantage that way so we need to look in other parts of the country where we aren't going to be able to live there because we live in somewhere else but we can still employ the same strategy really anywhere correct that's correct yeah and obviously you know the purchase prices in your areas and the scale but so should your income right if you're living in San Francisco your income should be higher than if you lived in Louisiana right and that's nothing against Louisiana that's just the fact right I mean different markets cost more so you know and one a year may not be possible maybe you do one every two years maybe you do one every three years but getting it on your on your radar to understand the possibilities that it unlocks utilizing a strategy like this and how it can replace what traditionally has been told to us is like detried and true investing method in America which is the 401k right and ira's and you know whatever they're all investing in stocks right but I got a little puppy going crazy here you guys but uh you know I just think it brings a different level of thinking it's funner because I mean I don't do you guys but I get more excited investing in real estate than I do buying Apple stock Apple stock definitely like oh they're releasing the new iPhone no way it looks the same as last years and you don't have as much agency over the investment either you don't have as much control over what that investment does because you can beautify the property you can make it more appealing there are things you can do to increase the value of that rent of that rental of the building itself and you know it's there's a sense of ownership and pride too in this I am building something that again you know it's funny I've never well I guess I could make an exception to this that during the mortgage mortgage crash in 2008 and in 2009 that was a different situation because those were a lot of loans that just shouldn't have been written and people who shouldn't have been getting those loans that that is not going to happen again what we hope because certainly um you know banks have learned their lesson but I can tell you being in the industry it is a nightmare getting somebody alone it is so hard to get alone that I don't believe another 2008 to have and unless we just slash all regulations which maybe happens I hope it does not um yeah but it is it is incredibly difficult to get a loan nowadays um that in 2008 is it intrinsically impossible to happen the way the system is currently structured it's just impossible we we can't have a scenario like that take place again now we get out like an auto loan crash or different things like that and that maybe what we can discuss on future episodes but um we will not have another real estate bubble it just it can't happen with the way that financing is structured nowadays so I was thinking that I've know a lot of people that own multiple investment properties I have not heard one of them and again post that time when maybe people were getting loans they shouldn't have um or they shouldn't have been able to rather not that they shouldn't have shouldn't have been able to and I've not heard one person say boy that was a bad idea of investing in and multi-family or you know income based I literally haven't met one person who said that now of course not every investment is a good idea but it I mean my brother-in-law has a property in Tampa he bought it for gosh 130 thousand dollars it's right across from the stadium he rents it out to mostly to people who short-term rentals people that want to watch the game you know during football season concerts he rents it out short-term rentals he only has to rent it out like 10 days a month to make you know to make his nut and he makes thousands of dollars in in net revenue every single month from like a hundred and thirty thousand dollar purchase it's never going to appreciate to any massive level but is great regular income and one day you know who knows maybe it will be worth something more but regardless um it's it's it's kind of saved because you know there was a little time when he was in between jobs and he was like oh shoot you know I don't you know I don't oh no I do have income coming in you know every month so that's another reason to kind of keep it in mind is you know as long as uh he purchased it outright because he had the ability to do that so he didn't have to worry about a mortgage payment so I guess he didn't really have a nut so to speak but but he he was paying himself back and it's been a wonderful investment for him and anyway again we all know people that have done this and they rarely are you know unless they just mispriced it and their rental prices isn't where it could be and you know what who knows everyone can buy a lemon but if you do your research this is a pretty solid idea so um I think you know and you and David are kind of some of the biggest industry voices to sort of give the strategy away and also you know we want our audience to to to check you guys out as well because you guys have your own your own mortgage lending brokerage which is really exciting after so many years of being in the industry and it's just been crushing it the the one brokerage is where like everybody to go so for your traditional clients the traditional you know a primary home resident buyers or self buyers rather um I want you to go to the one brokerage.com give David and Christian an opportunity to earn that business but also let's start talking about investment strategies to our primary home buyers and sellers right the people that are only putting stuff into 401k's have these conversations you know get Christian and David to talk with them as well and their team they will help them guide them through this process this is really an amazing idea that I want our audience to deeply consider from a tax perspective and also a retirement perspective it is something that just doesn't even today doesn't give as get as much press and as it should um and you know it's uh there's a lot of bad information out there too so absolutely yeah 100% and there's you know you guys have to be careful about it because unless unless somebody is doing it themselves providing a service you know repeatable source you have to be careful there's a lot of people claiming they can do a lot of stuff right I'm still here and all the time that you can buy real estate with no money down and sure there's wholesaling subject to and creative financing be careful right it's what that's that you know it's it's not the people putting 20% down they get slammed right it's not the people investing confidently buying a primary every year making sure that it rents well afterwards it's not those people getting slammed it's the people trying to skip steps find the easy path there's no um there's no secret sauce right it's it's hard work it's fundamentals and it's it's confident and and defensive investing that gets you ahead um somebody may get watery but if you buy tickets your whole life you're gonna come out below right you're gonna you're not gonna come out on top right right yeah super well said and great place for us to wrap up this this
