[00:02:26] Guys, let's just get to the main event.
[00:02:28] Thanks for 500 episodes and hopefully another 500
[00:02:31] in the upcoming years.
[00:02:33] And let's get to it.
[00:02:34] My conversation with Sarah DeWolf.
[00:02:49] Okay, today on the show, our guest is Sarah DeWolf
[00:02:52] from with real in the Quad Cities.
[00:02:55] For those of you not from the Midwest,
[00:02:58] what are the Quad Cities?
[00:02:59] There are four cities that sit right on the Illinois Iowa border.
[00:03:03] So she is licensed in both Illinois.
[00:03:06] And I think that's the best way to get the best out of it.
[00:03:06] 
[00:03:06] Iowa, but let me tell you more about Sarah.
[00:03:08] Now Sarah DeWolf is a licensed REALTOR
[00:03:09] both Illinois and Iowa since 2010.
[00:03:12] She is consistently among the top agents in the Quad Cities.
[00:03:16] 22, 22, two stats include selling over 36 million
[00:03:21] enclosed volume with 117 transactions.
[00:03:24] That's one every three days, amazing.
[00:03:28] And as an individual agent, she did that.
[00:03:30] Now she's also ranked in the prestigious Tom Ferry,
[00:03:33] the thousand best REALTORS in the country.
[00:03:37] She ranks number 195.
[00:03:38] She's in the top point, 0 1% of agents in the United States.
[00:03:44] And when she's not working, Sarah and her husband have two toddlers.
[00:03:47] They own a local young lumber yard, rental properties,
[00:03:50] and an Airbnb.
[00:03:52] This is a busy woman and I'm excited to chat with her.
[00:03:55] Sarah, welcome to the show.
[00:03:57] Thank you for having me.
[00:03:58] I'm tired just thinking about that.
[00:04:00] Well, I'm tired reading it.
[00:04:01] But I love that expression.
[00:04:03] I've probably said it in a million times on the show is
[00:04:05] if you want something done, give it to a busy mother.
[00:04:07] They just get everything done.
[00:04:09] But everyone follow Sarah on Instagram.
[00:04:13] Sarah DeWolf, that's DE.
[00:04:14] First of all, it's S-A-R-A-D-E-W-U-L-F-Q-C REALTOR.
[00:04:23] Yeah, Quad Cities.
[00:04:24] So guys, don't worry.
[00:04:25] It'll link to it in the show notes.
[00:04:27] Sarah DeWolf, QC REALTOR on Instagram.
[00:04:29] And we'll also have a link to our website,
[00:04:31] which is Sarah DeWolf Realtor.com.
[00:04:34] Sarah, I'm so excited to have you.
[00:04:36] Tell us, you got into the market in 2010.
[00:04:39] Not the easiest time to get into the market.
[00:04:42] So I want to hear about what that experience was like
[00:04:44] because we have a lot of agents today getting in right now.
[00:04:48] And it's not quite as awful as it was back then,
[00:04:50] but it is still a challenging time.
[00:04:52] So tell us about how you got started and why.
[00:04:55] Sure.
[00:04:56] So at the time in 2010, I was in college
[00:04:59] and my major was psychology.
[00:05:01] My dad was a REALTOR, so I am a second generation REALTOR.
[00:05:04] He was a managing broker for our offices
[00:05:07] and said, you should get into real estate.
[00:05:09] And so it wasn't something that I grew up thinking
[00:05:11] that I was going to do.
[00:05:12] And he did it for 20 years.
[00:05:14] And so I watched him and I always was interested in real estate,
[00:05:18] but I didn't know that that was the path I was going to go down.
[00:05:21] However, I didn't want to do school anymore.
[00:05:24] I didn't want to get my masters or PhD
[00:05:26] and psychology does come in handy every day with real estate.
[00:05:29] So it worked out.
[00:05:32] So him and I worked together.
[00:05:35] We would do all of our listings together and buyers separately.
[00:05:38] So it was kind of a, we weren't really a team, but sort of.
[00:05:41] We were the father-daughter team on listings.
[00:05:43] And so it was nice because he taught me everything I know.
[00:05:47] And we would drive around all day to different appointments
[00:05:50] and I would listen to him and listen to 45 different agents
[00:05:54] calling him with headaches.
[00:05:55] And so I felt like I was on a fast track
[00:05:57] to learning this business, which every day is different.
[00:06:01] And now 13 years in, I'm still learning things, of course.
[00:06:04] And each deal has different things
[00:06:07] that you've got to kind of work through.
[00:06:09] So he passed away in 2019.
[00:06:13] And it was pretty unexpected.
[00:06:15] He was in a surgery and I looked at my husband
[00:06:18] and we didn't know if he was going to make it out of that surgery.
[00:06:21] And I looked at my husband and said, what am I going to do?
[00:06:24] Because it had always just been him and I.
[00:06:27] He didn't die that night, thankfully,
[00:06:29] but I had two more weeks with him
[00:06:31] and he did, unfortunately, pass away.
[00:06:33] So I had to quickly pick up the pieces
[00:06:36] and I knew for sure that he wouldn't want me
[00:06:39] sitting around crying.
[00:06:40] So I just went right to work and figured out
[00:06:43] how am I going to really do this without him.
[00:06:46] So that was in 2019.
[00:06:49] And that year I had sold 12 million in sales and 2020.
[00:06:53] I sold 23 million.
[00:06:56] So I almost doubled my sales.
[00:06:58] Thank you.
[00:07:00] And grew it ever since then.
[00:07:01] So I hope he's looking down and proud,
[00:07:03] but he is certainly missed,
[00:07:05] but how lucky am I that I had such a great teacher for 10 years.
[00:07:10] Yeah, life is a mixture of tragedy
[00:07:13] and fortunate events.
[00:07:16] And it's just this dance of peaks and valleys
[00:07:19] and we all go through it.
[00:07:21] And yeah, my heart goes out to you for losing your father.
[00:07:26] We're all going to do it someday.
[00:07:28] We're all going to lose our parents
[00:07:31] and it's a scariest thing ever.
[00:07:34] But I also, you also had some health issue yourself
[00:07:40] that came at a very young age.
[00:07:42] And if you don't mind sharing that,
[00:07:45] I'm curious because what I'm curious about is
[00:07:48] how that experience maybe shaped you into who you are today.
[00:07:53] Because it was a pretty serious one, if you don't mind.
[00:07:55] Yeah, absolutely.
[00:07:57] So I had melanoma.
[00:07:59] I had a mole on my arm that didn't look great,
[00:08:03] but at the time I was 26 and that it's probably nothing.
[00:08:06] And so I ended up going in probably way later than I should have.
[00:08:10] And they took the mole off and said,
[00:08:12] oh, best case scenario, we caught it early stage 1A.
[00:08:16] We'll remove it.
[00:08:17] And then they said, but because of the age,
[00:08:19] we're going to test a couple lymph nodes just to make sure.
[00:08:22] Well, they did that and it,
[00:08:24] two of the lymph nodes tested positive.
[00:08:25] So for whatever reason, the type of cancer that I had,
[00:08:28] they could see actively splitting under a microscope.
[00:08:31] So it was moving very, very quickly.
[00:08:33] So I quickly went from stage 1A to stage 3B,
[00:08:37] which is much more serious.
[00:08:39] So I had to do a lot of scans and luckily it hadn't spread.
[00:08:42] Past my lymph nodes, we caught it kind of just in time.
[00:08:45] So I had several surgeries and that was a,
[00:08:47] that was a rough time.
[00:08:49] It was, I was probably three years into the business.
[00:08:51] And so it was starting to get more consistent, but not quite.
[00:08:55] And so between just being scared to death, literally,
[00:08:59] am I going to survive this?
[00:09:01] And I was dating my husband at the time, but we weren't married.
[00:09:04] And so that was about a year long of going back and forth
[00:09:08] to Iowa City to the hospital there and just making sure
[00:09:11] that everything was okay.
[00:09:13] And thank God no issues sense.
[00:09:14] And that was, it'll be 10 years in February.
[00:09:17] But it changed my life.
[00:09:19] I can tell you that for sure.
[00:09:21] Yeah, what did, obviously, significant events like that
[00:09:26] do tend to change people's perspective
[00:09:29] or maybe even change their goals or the things that are important
[00:09:35] the things that are important to them, their values.
[00:09:38] How did that change here?
[00:09:40] I've always been a don't sweat the small stuff type of person,
[00:09:44] but even more so now it's little things
[00:09:47] that aren't going to matter in five years or an agent
[00:09:50] just makes you so mad.
[00:09:51] You want to call and yell at them or say,
[00:09:53] this isn't right, but is it worth it?
[00:09:55] Is it going to change anything?
[00:09:56] No.
[00:09:57] So it's just a matter of taking a day at a time
[00:10:00] and being so grateful for my health.
[00:10:03] That at 26, it hits you different when you start to think,
[00:10:07] am I going to make it?
[00:10:09] And you really don't think about that
[00:10:10] and your 20 is very often.
[00:10:11] And really without our health, we have nothing.
[00:10:14] So all these little things, stressors in life,
[00:10:17] if you're happy, if your family's healthy,
[00:10:19] that's all that matters.
[00:10:21] Yeah, I was having a moment last night
[00:10:23] where I was starting to judge myself unfairly.
[00:10:27] I was thinking about something in my life
[00:10:28] that I don't have as much of as I want
[00:10:31] and I was cooking and I really enjoy cooking.
[00:10:34] And I was making this meal that I'd never made before.
[00:10:37] It was kind of a fun thing.
[00:10:38] But I was sitting there going, gosh, I don't have this in that.
[00:10:40] And I'm such a loser, whatever.
[00:10:43] The things that negative self-thought.
[00:10:45] And I realized, I said, well, but I have this moment
[00:10:48] where I'm cooking and why am I, like I could enjoy this moment
[00:10:51] while I'm cooking.
[00:10:52] I can get back to beating myself up later.
[00:10:55] But I said, boy, I'm missing out on this fun thing
[00:10:58] I like to do just because I'm caught up in this judgment.
[00:11:03] So it is really important, I think,
[00:11:05] to monitor and pay attention, be mindful of what's going on
[00:11:09] inside of a specially around, as you mentioned, anger.
[00:11:12] I think a great rule of thumb in this industry
[00:11:15] and anger is going to come up because people just do goofy things
[00:11:18] and other REALTORS may do things that you don't like
[00:11:21] and your clients may do things that you don't like.
[00:11:23] But I always say, I don't make good decisions when I'm angry
[00:11:27] and I certainly don't have access to all my faculties
[00:11:30] and I can't make oftentimes the best logical decisions.
[00:11:33] So I think what you said was really great.
[00:11:35] It's like when you're angry, that's not right,
[00:11:38] really the time to communicate, right?
[00:11:40] Settle down first, rewires, it's like Sarah says,
[00:11:43] it may just be a small thing, even though it feels big
[00:11:45] in the moment, give yourself a breath and then respond.
[00:11:48] Let it go.
[00:11:49] Yes.
[00:11:50] Or just let it go.
[00:11:52] Let it go.
[00:11:52] Let it go.
[00:11:54] Yes, unless it's something where you can't let it go
[00:11:56] and you need to actually take action.
[00:11:58] But most of the time, most things resolve themselves.
[00:12:00] But Sarah, I want to learn more about you
[00:12:04] because you have to get licensed in two states,
[00:12:06] not the easiest thing or most fun thing to do,
[00:12:09] but based on the geography of where you practice,
[00:12:11] it is critical.
[00:12:13] And so you have to sort of know how to do deals on
[00:12:17] two different probably MLSs.
[00:12:18] I don't know if it's the same.
[00:12:19] It's the same MLS.
[00:12:21] Luckily, it's the same MLS.
[00:12:22] Oh, thank goodness, that makes it look easier.
[00:12:25] But I want to talk, you did 117 sales last year.
[00:12:28] That is insane.
[00:12:30] In the best possible compliment I could give somebody,
[00:12:33] you knocked out almost 40 million in production.
[00:12:38] And this is what you did yourself, which is crazy.
[00:12:41] Let's talk about how you did that.
[00:12:43] Yes, you had a father, great mentor, wonderful REALTOR.
[00:12:48] And you learned and developed your skills.
[00:12:50] But most people who even come from a family
[00:12:55] that was in real estate, they don't do 117 sales.
[00:12:58] In a year.
[00:12:59] So what's your secret?
[00:13:00] Not that there's a secret, but what's your,
[00:13:02] I hate to say that word.
[00:13:03] What's your strategy?
[00:13:05] Well, works.
[00:13:06] Yeah, it's been, so I had systems in place
[00:13:10] when I first started that I've tried to tweak over the years
[00:13:14] as Sharon Sarvatsis says just because it's tried and true
[00:13:17] doesn't mean that it's working right now.
[00:13:19] So I've advertised, I used to advertise on Zillow
[00:13:22] that 10 years ago that was huge for me.
[00:13:24] And I had a ton of customers come and clients come in that way.
[00:13:28] Now I would never advertise on Zillow.
[00:13:31] So it's little things along that I've just tried to tweak
[00:13:33] and get better.
[00:13:35] I should note that I also had a baby last year.
[00:13:37] And with that being said, I have an incredibly supportive
[00:13:40] husband and family and mom, and to which none of this
[00:13:43] would be possible without all of them.
[00:13:45] So it's not just me, but I really,
[00:13:49] to think two big things that my dad instilled in me
[00:13:52] is to create raving fans and that customer service
[00:13:55] is a lost art.
[00:13:57] And I always remember when I go to a hotel
[00:14:01] and they go above and beyond, maybe it's my birthday
[00:14:03] and there's a bottle of champagne in the room.
[00:14:05] And it's little things like that.
[00:14:07] If you do more than what the customer expects,
[00:14:10] I shouldn't say anyone, but most people could be a REALTOR.
[00:14:14] It's a lot harder than I think what people think.
[00:14:17] And it's hard to grow your business.
[00:14:20] And I also don't think that people sit down and say,
[00:14:23] okay, this is my business.
[00:14:24] I'm not just selling real estate.
[00:14:27] I'm creating a business and I'm in charge of that.
[00:14:30] Working on the business as opposed to in the businesses,
[00:14:34] all the stuff I need to do now, my clients,
[00:14:36] my prospecting, all of the activities.
[00:14:38] And then on the businesses, okay, let's take a step back
[00:14:41] and look at this as a business owner,
[00:14:43] where they're inefficiencies, where can I delegate,
[00:14:45] how can I make this whole process,
[00:14:48] all these processes run smoother?
[00:14:50] Yes, yes.
[00:14:51] And I guess it's been interesting from 2010 to now,
[00:14:56] seeing the difference in the market.
[00:14:58] And in the Quad Cities, we're lucky
[00:14:59] because we don't see these big huge drops in prices.
[00:15:04] We've been consistent as far as equity goes.
[00:15:07] And so that helps, but it's also not a big,
[00:15:10] it's not a huge town like Chicago,
[00:15:12] but with Iowa and Illinois, we've got quite a few people.
[00:15:16] So I guess it's just, it's important to look at your business
[00:15:20] and see what's working and what's not working
[00:15:23] and always be tweaking those systems.
[00:15:25] I think that, oh, go ahead.
[00:15:27] No, go ahead.
[00:15:28] I said, when I started and you don't have a lot of clients
[00:15:33] and I was 23 and so a lot of my friends weren't quite
[00:15:36] buying houses yet.
[00:15:38] And there's things that I know that I did write
[00:15:41] and there's, I guess, advice that I have,
[00:15:43] that I should have done.
[00:15:44] I should have been working on Google reviews from day one.
[00:15:47] I can't imagine how many I would have.
[00:15:49] Let's pause for a second.
[00:15:50] So I want to step in with this because we have about 800,
[00:15:53] just under 800 agents that are firm.
[00:15:56] And we didn't do much with Google reviews up until about
[00:15:59] maybe three years ago.
[00:16:01] And now what we do is we send the opportunity
[00:16:04] to do a Google review to every one of our broker
[00:16:07] or every one of our agents clients.
[00:16:09] So that we, you know, we just say,
[00:16:12] hey, let us know what you thought of your REALTOR.
[00:16:14] And we went from having almost no reviews
[00:16:17] to now we have, I think, six or 700.
[00:16:21] It's never too late to start everyone.
[00:16:23] This can work.
[00:16:24] Go ahead.
[00:16:24] This is a good story.
[00:16:26] So I had my previous brokerage,
[00:16:29] they used testimonial tree.
[00:16:31] And when I switched, I lost all of those.
[00:16:33] So I went to my Google page and I think I had 11 reviews,
[00:16:36] which is absolutely ridiculous for doing this for 13 years.
[00:16:40] So I knew I needed to do something in quick.
[00:16:42] So I have always been in a believer in mailings
[00:16:45] and not the traditional postcard
[00:16:47] that people are just going to throw in the trash.
[00:16:49] I try to stick to maybe three or four quarterly
[00:16:52] something that they're going to keep on their refrigerator.
[00:16:55] So in Iowa, we don't have a professional football team.
[00:16:58] So the hot guys are, everybody cheers for the hot guys.
[00:17:00] Or they should.
[00:17:01] So I sent out the football magnet
[00:17:02] and then I'm top of mind on their refrigerator
[00:17:05] all season long.
[00:17:06] I've sent out grocery magnets.
[00:17:08] All kinds of just different things.
[00:17:10] But one thing that I did recently is I needed Google reviews.
[00:17:14] So I sent out some things saying,
[00:17:16] I'm celebrating 13 years in business.
[00:17:18] Thank you for all your support.
[00:17:20] I'm going to be giving away.
[00:17:21] I think I did a solo stove, a pizza oven, a black stone.
[00:17:25] Kind of some cool things that I spent about $1,500.
[00:17:29] But I found it.
[00:17:30] Those are good gifts.
[00:17:30] Yeah, I sent it to my mailing list,
[00:17:33] which is about 500 people.
[00:17:34] It's past clients, but it's also just my sphere of influence.
[00:17:38] And I got 72 Google reviews.
[00:17:41] So that, yes.
[00:17:43] And so in my clients were so excited.
[00:17:45] They wrote the review, which probably didn't take
[00:17:48] a more than a minute.
[00:17:49] And when we drew their name, we sent anyone that filled one out.
[00:17:52] We sent, even if it's a $10 gift card ice cream or something,
[00:17:55] they got something.
[00:17:57] But it was a good way to quickly grow those Google reviews
[00:18:00] because reviews are so important.
[00:18:02] And everyone's going to Google you,
[00:18:04] even if they're your closest friends.
[00:18:06] They're still going to Google you, just because they want
[00:18:08] to see how you do or what other clients think about you.
[00:18:12] And Google is obviously top of the mountain for reviews.
[00:18:16] I would say Zello is probably number two
[00:18:18] for where people find reviews.
[00:18:21] So yes, it's a great idea.
[00:18:23] And it also helps with SEO, local SEO, in particular,
[00:18:26] meaning showing up on web searches
[00:18:29] when people are searching for REALTORS in their area.
[00:18:32] Google can make a general assumption
[00:18:35] that if somebody's got hundreds and hundreds of five-star reviews,
[00:18:38] odds are they're probably a pretty decent search
[00:18:41] result to serve up to a consumer who's looking.
[00:18:45] So yes, Google, my business, is the name of the platform.
[00:18:48] Or I think they changed the name.
[00:18:49] Now I think it's just Google business.
[00:18:50] But anyway, get yourself on Google.
[00:18:53] Why would you talk about referrals?
[00:18:55] Because, well, I'm going to talk about something
[00:18:57] that leads to referrals.
[00:18:58] You said, going above and beyond, can you
[00:19:02] give us a couple of examples of ways in which you do that?
[00:19:05] That maybe you think not every agent does?
[00:19:08] Sure.
[00:19:09] So most people don't buy in sell houses every day.
[00:19:13] So a lot of times, especially with first-time home buyers,
[00:19:15] they're intimidated and really don't know what to do.
[00:19:19] So it's amazing to me how many agents
[00:19:21] don't do buyers' consultations.
[00:19:23] And that is a must for me.
[00:19:25] So when someone calls and they're ready to buy a house,
[00:19:27] whether it's their first house or their 10th house,
[00:19:29] we sit down to talk about their goals.
[00:19:32] I give expectations on the market.
[00:19:34] What's to expect?
[00:19:35] And if you do an inspection and you want to ask for something,
[00:19:38] please know that it means the contract.
[00:19:40] So we don't want to ask for something small.
[00:19:42] Because a lot of times buyers want to renegotiate
[00:19:45] or whatever it ends up being.
[00:19:46] So I do different checkpoints through the process with them.
[00:19:50] We start with our buyers' consultation,
[00:19:52] assuming they're already pre-approved.
[00:19:54] We'll start shopping for houses.
[00:19:55] As we're shopping, I'm pointing out things.
[00:19:57] I'm certainly not an inspector, but I see a lot of inspection
[00:20:00] so I can say, hey, this might come up, just be prepared.
[00:20:04] Then I have a full-time assistant, shout out, Kerry.
[00:20:07] I could not do this without her.
[00:20:09] She is amazing.
[00:20:10] And so she does different checkpoints.
[00:20:12] Like when we get closer to closing,
[00:20:14] it's, hey, Sarah wanted me to remind you to switch utilities
[00:20:17] and its links to all the utilities,
[00:20:19] even internet cable, all those things.
[00:20:22] Or, and then two weeks after closing,
[00:20:24] we send out an email saying, hey, just a reminder,
[00:20:26] make sure you sign up for that Homestead tax credit.
[00:20:30] So I try to just make the process as simple as possible
[00:20:34] for them, but also not to, I don't,
[00:20:38] I've never looked at my business as transactional.
[00:20:41] I've always just said yes to everything.
[00:20:43] And I think that that is in part of big,
[00:20:46] I guess it's a big part of my success.
[00:20:48] I see a lot of new agents that get so caught up in price point.
[00:20:52] And I don't wanna go show that $60,000 house.
[00:20:55] Well, the person that's buying the $60,000 house
[00:20:57] has family and friends.
[00:20:58] And if you can create a raving fan, like my dad said,
[00:21:02] they're gonna tell all their friends and family
[00:21:04] what a great experience they had with you.
[00:21:06] So that's been really important to me
[00:21:08] is how do I make sure that my buyers and sellers
[00:21:11] have the best experience and that I'm giving them
[00:21:15] best case scenario, worst case scenario,
[00:21:17] and enough information for them to make an informed decision.
[00:21:22] So right now the market is,
[00:21:24] thank you for all of that by the way.
[00:21:25] That was all just exactly the way I feel about
[00:21:28] what REALTORS ought to do for customer service
[00:21:31] and going above and beyond is,
[00:21:34] it's what I think M. Scott Peck wrote,
[00:21:37] it's never crowded along the extra mile
[00:21:39] or someone wrote that book, but he's right.
[00:21:42] It's literally not that crowded on the extra mile.
[00:21:45] And it doesn't mean you have to, you know,
[00:21:47] sprints a mile for somebody.
[00:21:49] It does not mean that.
[00:21:50] It just means going a little bit beyond what they would expect.
[00:21:54] You know, it's as simple as just knowing
[00:21:56] what's going on in your client's lives
[00:21:57] and reaching out to them from time to time
[00:21:59] to check in on them and ask about their kids
[00:22:02] or whatever they're dealing with as a family or business.
[00:22:06] But the market is shifted.
[00:22:09] So we have interest rates in the eights at this point.
[00:22:13] If you're lucky in the high sevens
[00:22:15] and there's the vast majority of homeowners in this country
[00:22:19] have a under a four percent mortgage at this point.
[00:22:22] In fact, I think it's like 90% have under a four percent mortgage.
[00:22:26] So there's not a big incentive for people
[00:22:29] to move unless they have to.
[00:22:30] So I'm curious about what you're doing to stay positive,
[00:22:34] stay productive and just keep your business
[00:22:38] chugging along right now.
[00:22:41] Yeah.
[00:22:41] Social media, I think, is our biggest tool as agents
[00:22:45] and I'll get into a little bit on, well,
[00:22:48] with social media, I think that it is the most important thing
[00:22:51] that we can be posting to, and people get so caught up in rates
[00:22:55] and obviously it's very impactful into our market.
[00:22:58] But usually what I tell people when they get nervous about it is
[00:23:01] if you're comfortable with the payment,
[00:23:03] the interest rate shouldn't matter too much.
[00:23:05] And people sign up for 27% credit cards every day.
[00:23:08] So if you love the house, that is a great point.
[00:23:12] So if you love the house and you can afford it, buy it.
[00:23:15] Always reply.
[00:23:16] And by the way, don't sign up for 27% credit cards, everybody.
[00:23:19] Yes, especially while you're buying a house.
[00:23:22] Yes, yes.
[00:23:23] And if you are somebody that doesn't pay their entire balance off
[00:23:26] every month, then yes, do not sign up for it.
[00:23:29] But there is so absolutely right.
[00:23:31] You're right, the rate isn't that important,
[00:23:33] but what the rate can do is still drive people away.
[00:23:36] So you know that the rate isn't as relevant,
[00:23:40] but the consumer might feel like, oh, I missed the bow
[00:23:42] a couple of years ago, I could have gotten in for 2.9.
[00:23:46] So what is your, does that happen?
[00:23:48] Do you come across people like that?
[00:23:50] Oh, yeah, constantly.
[00:23:52] And a lot of people sometimes it doesn't make sense
[00:23:54] for them to move right now.
[00:23:56] If it's going to be a lateral move to a small,
[00:23:59] even a smaller house based on a 2.9% interest rate,
[00:24:03] then we just pause it.
[00:24:06] I guess for me, it's the way that I've kept things moving
[00:24:10] is I try to remind people to not get their local
[00:24:14] real estate advice from the news.
[00:24:17] The news is going to talk about its doomsday
[00:24:20] and houses aren't selling and that isn't true at all.
[00:24:24] We still very much are in an inventory issue,
[00:24:26] at least in Iowa and Illinois in the Quad Cities.
[00:24:29] So things are selling really quickly.
[00:24:31] So one thing that I've done well for 13 years
[00:24:33] is every Tuesday I send out expired letters.
[00:24:37] So I go through the last seven days of expired listings
[00:24:40] and we know those people want to sell their house
[00:24:42] or they wouldn't have put it for sale.
[00:24:44] And sometimes circumstances change,
[00:24:46] but I would say that I get, I don't know,
[00:24:49] two to four listings a year from that.
[00:24:50] And a lot of times it's just,
[00:24:53] they picked, they just called any agent
[00:24:56] and maybe didn't have a good experience
[00:24:57] or maybe their house just wasn't marketed properly.
[00:25:00] But to me in this market,
[00:25:02] at least here everything is selling.
[00:25:04] So an expired listing is a really good way
[00:25:07] to get a new listing.
[00:25:09] So I started that 13 years ago and it still works.
[00:25:12] That's amazing.
[00:25:13] So I'm gonna break this down for anyone
[00:25:15] who's not familiar with what expires are.
[00:25:18] So these are obviously listings that have expired
[00:25:20] and there are services that you can subscribe to
[00:25:22] for really very inexpensive pricing
[00:25:25] that will serve you up daily here are the expires
[00:25:28] or you can obviously look on your MLS system
[00:25:31] and set up searches for that.
[00:25:33] But a lot of companies will provide these daily leads to you.
[00:25:37] The problem is they sell those leads
[00:25:39] to lots of different agents.
[00:25:40] And so what Sarah is doing that's very unique
[00:25:43] is typically when people hear,
[00:25:45] maybe you should call expires is that calling process.
[00:25:48] I'm gonna call the homeowner and that can work.
[00:25:51] It certainly can work.
[00:25:52] The challenge is that homeowners probably getting
[00:25:54] a lot of phone calls, especially when those leads
[00:25:58] become available because when it expires
[00:26:00] all these lead companies push it out
[00:26:02] to all of the people that are purchasing them.
[00:26:04] And so the person might get 10 phone calls in a day.
[00:26:06] You might be number eight and they're gonna be like,
[00:26:08] oh, stop calling.
[00:26:09] It has nothing to do with you.
[00:26:11] So it's Sarah does, which is really a lot softer
[00:26:13] is she sends a mail or out.
[00:26:16] Do you do like a letter or postcard?
[00:26:17] What was it?
[00:26:17] It's just a letter and it's at,
[00:26:20] it's addressed right to them in handwriting,
[00:26:22] but the letter itself is tight.
[00:26:24] Yes.
[00:26:25] And so it's very simple too, maybe three paragraphs
[00:26:29] of just a note, non-obligation.
[00:26:31] We can get together, kind of talk about different strategies.
[00:26:34] And it works.
[00:26:35] And I'd be happy to share it with anyone that's listening.
[00:26:38] So feel free to email or shoot me a message.
[00:26:40] Please do, that is so generous.
[00:26:42] We'll provide Sarah's contact information in the show notes
[00:26:45] so you can reach out to her to get her expired letter.
[00:26:48] Although if you're in her market area,
[00:26:50] let's not do that.
[00:26:51] But anywhere else, yeah, I'm only teasing.
[00:26:54] There are no secrets in real estate,
[00:26:56] but we are so grateful that you share that.
[00:26:59] And so this is really smart.
[00:27:01] And I wanna break this down just a little bit further.
[00:27:04] So every Tuesday or once a week,
[00:27:07] Sarah sends, yeah, every Tuesday,
[00:27:09] Sarah sees all the expires that have come in in the past week
[00:27:11] and she sends this letter out hand writes the envelope
[00:27:14] because what do we know?
[00:27:16] Handwritten envelopes get opened.
[00:27:17] Regular envelopes get thrown away.
[00:27:20] So handwrite your envelopes inside,
[00:27:23] just a standard letter.
[00:27:25] And Sarah said she gets anywhere from two to four listings
[00:27:29] a year.
[00:27:30] Now that might not sound like a lot
[00:27:31] for sending on all those mailers.
[00:27:33] By the way, a lot of these lead companies
[00:27:35] that send you expires can also send out mailers for you,
[00:27:38] although I don't know if they can do the handwriting.
[00:27:40] So Sarah does that manually,
[00:27:41] which is probably the better way to do it.
[00:27:44] But you could technically automate it
[00:27:45] if you really wanted to.
[00:27:47] But the idea is that this is still a cash flow positive
[00:27:52] marketing expense because if she's sending out mailers,
[00:27:56] I'm assuming it still nets you two to four deals a year
[00:27:59] has got to pay for all of the mailers I'm guessing.
[00:28:01] Easily, yes.
[00:28:03] Easily.
[00:28:03] So it's kind of a no-brainer.
[00:28:05] There's no reason to not do it.
[00:28:07] And it doesn't require that much work you're assistant
[00:28:10] I'm assuming does the majority of the heavy lifting there.
[00:28:13] Boy, that is such a brilliant strategy, guys.
[00:28:16] She just gave you a basically something
[00:28:19] that should pay for itself.
[00:28:21] Now every market's different.
[00:28:22] And maybe if you're in Metro, Chicago,
[00:28:24] maybe that's different than a more rural area.
[00:28:27] Sarah is not necessarily in a rural area,
[00:28:28] but a much smaller group of cities.
[00:28:31] So perhaps the, you know,
[00:28:32] but I don't know maybe the competition
[00:28:33] is even more fierce where she is too.
[00:28:35] But regardless, it's a heck of a good idea.
[00:28:38] And you just got to go try it for like two years.
[00:28:40] I'd say if you do it for two years,
[00:28:42] I'd be shocked if you didn't get.
[00:28:44] And use her letter.
[00:28:44] She's going to give you the exact letter she uses
[00:28:46] that literally wins business.
[00:28:48] So please reach out to her.
[00:28:50] That is awesome.
[00:28:51] So now that things have changed
[00:28:55] with respect to where the market is,
[00:28:58] what are some of the things?
[00:28:59] So in addition to expires,
[00:29:01] you know, what are you doing for a rural perspective?
[00:29:04] Like how are you staying in touch with your sphere?
[00:29:08] So the biggest thing that I do after every closing
[00:29:11] is add any of the clients on social media.
[00:29:14] It's the best way to keep in touch and to be,
[00:29:16] you always want to be top of mind awareness.
[00:29:18] So when someone asks,
[00:29:19] hey, who's the REALTOR you would call?
[00:29:21] I'm number one.
[00:29:22] The biggest thing that I didn't want to happen
[00:29:24] is that we closed the transaction
[00:29:26] and they never hear from me again.
[00:29:28] And five years later,
[00:29:29] what was her name again?
[00:29:30] And I don't want that.
[00:29:31] So I, another thing that I do is if I have clients
[00:29:35] that maybe I sold a house to them five years ago
[00:29:37] and they got married,
[00:29:39] I'll, I don't know if you know what small woods is,
[00:29:42] but it's a, it's an online,
[00:29:44] if there's a wedding photo,
[00:29:46] it goes in a wood frame and it's customized to them
[00:29:49] and you can make them any size.
[00:29:50] And so whether they live here or they live,
[00:29:53] some, they've moved away,
[00:29:54] we'll mail that to their house.
[00:29:55] And it's probably, I don't know, 50 or $60 maybe.
[00:29:58] So it's not the cheapest,
[00:29:59] but it's also not the most expensive.
[00:30:01] And it has the biggest impact
[00:30:03] because it's so emotional.
[00:30:05] It's, oh my gosh, this is our family.
[00:30:07] It's, it's a great thing to hang in their house.
[00:30:09] So how do you get the photo?
[00:30:11] How do you get the photo?
[00:30:12] If they post it on Facebook.
[00:30:14] So I see, so you, so you don't ask for it.
[00:30:17] You just search through social media,
[00:30:19] you see if they have some sort of engagement photo
[00:30:21] or wedding photo or something that they seem to think
[00:30:24] is, is important to them.
[00:30:26] And then you take that photo and you just do this
[00:30:28] without them even knowing and you just shows up on their door.
[00:30:30] You just shows up at their door
[00:30:31] and says, congratulations,
[00:30:33] wishing you a lifetime of happiness.
[00:30:34] And same with babies, that's another big one.
[00:30:37] So I, the biggest blessing I think in real estate
[00:30:41] is clients that become friends.
[00:30:43] And not everyone, of course,
[00:30:45] but the majority I would say become my friend.
[00:30:48] And it's important to be a good friend.
[00:30:51] It's not just real estate,
[00:30:52] but I also want to be the person that,
[00:30:54] if they move here and they know no one,
[00:30:57] hey, who's a good doctor?
[00:30:58] Where should I get my hair done?
[00:30:59] Just little things that I can maybe answer for them
[00:31:02] or give them suggestions.
[00:31:03] I want to be there, go to and all things real estate.
[00:31:06] By the way, Sarah is the go to for dermatologists
[00:31:09] in her area because of her.
[00:31:11] I certainly am.
[00:31:12] Sorry, that was, that was an easy joke.
[00:31:13] I just had to say.
[00:31:14] Yes.
[00:31:14] But it is, but it is a really good point.
[00:31:17] By the way, everybody get your annual dermatologist appointment.
[00:31:19] And in fact, here's a little pro tip.
[00:31:21] Don't leave the office before scheduling the next years
[00:31:24] because you're going to forget.
[00:31:25] That's what I do every year.
[00:31:26] Never leave a doctor's office without scheduling
[00:31:28] the next appointment.
[00:31:29] Otherwise, if you're like me, you won't remember.
[00:31:31] But it's really important because if I was moving
[00:31:33] to the Quad cities, I would need a dermatologist.
[00:31:35] I would need a bunch of doctors.
[00:31:38] Right? A general person, I might need a sports medicine person.
[00:31:41] And I wouldn't know where to go.
[00:31:44] I mean, I guess you can look that up online sort of.
[00:31:47] But I'd much rather have referrals.
[00:31:49] And so you want to be the, I'm guessing you want to be
[00:31:52] the hub of all things, service related,
[00:31:57] whether it's real estate or not for your clients.
[00:31:59] Is that accurate?
[00:32:00] Yes.
[00:32:00] Yes.
[00:32:00] And mostly it's, I want to keep the relationship
[00:32:03] going after closing.
[00:32:04] So that six months down the road,
[00:32:06] three years down the road, whatever it is,
[00:32:08] we're still touching base the whole way through.
[00:32:10] By the way, back to the, the, the small woods,
[00:32:13] the small wood idea, which I'm looking at it right now,
[00:32:16] I pulled it up while you were talking.
[00:32:18] Sarah does this on an anniversary,
[00:32:20] but you don't even have to do it on an anniversary.
[00:32:23] Like it literally could be done at any time.
[00:32:25] So it's something that if you're like,
[00:32:26] I don't know when my clients anniversary is,
[00:32:28] no problem, just find a picture of them,
[00:32:30] send it to them randomly.
[00:32:31] They will, in fact, maybe even not on their anniversary
[00:32:34] would be, maybe more unexpected,
[00:32:36] although on their anniversary is amazing as well.
[00:32:39] But and that's the other thing too,
[00:32:41] is everyone should know this information.
[00:32:43] You should reach out to your clients and say,
[00:32:45] hey, you know, I like to know wedding anniversaries
[00:32:48] so that I can possibly, you know, send something.
[00:32:50] So if you need to get that information,
[00:32:52] you can literally just ask your clients for it.
[00:32:54] I don't think anyone would, would say,
[00:32:56] I don't want you to have that information.
[00:32:58] You want to know what the children's ages are.
[00:33:00] You want to know major life events stuff.
[00:33:02] So did they get a new job?
[00:33:04] Did they, you know, are they moving?
[00:33:06] Obviously, it's important.
[00:33:07] But, you know, these are important things
[00:33:09] because if Sarah knows that somebody's child
[00:33:12] is, you know, a junior in high school,
[00:33:15] well, they're probably looking at colleges
[00:33:17] or maybe, you know, depending on the family,
[00:33:19] that may be something they're doing.
[00:33:21] So she now knows, oh, well,
[00:33:22] maybe I could do something nice for them,
[00:33:25] you know, when she's ready to leave for college
[00:33:27] or whatever.
[00:33:27] The important part is she, Sarah now has information.
[00:33:31] She can choose to do something with,
[00:33:33] which is, this is all the fun stuff of real estate too, right?
[00:33:36] Yes, right.
[00:33:37] Yeah.
[00:33:38] I'm trying to think of anything.
[00:33:39] Oh, closing gifts are another big deal.
[00:33:41] I think a lot of times agents either forget
[00:33:43] or don't want to do that.
[00:33:45] And it really kind of seals the deal for me,
[00:33:47] I feel like where I would say nine times out of 10
[00:33:50] if they don't already have some sort of like ring doorbell.
[00:33:53] I give a ring doorbell at closing
[00:33:55] and sometimes a gift card to a local restaurant.
[00:33:58] I try to never forget kids and dogs.
[00:34:01] So they'll be, we have a place called
[00:34:03] Freddy's Fritters here and it's a custom dog treat company.
[00:34:07] So we'll throw in treats for them or ice cream for the kids,
[00:34:10] something so that they know that I care about their family
[00:34:13] and I'm really excited for them
[00:34:14] on their purchase or their sale.
[00:34:16] Yeah, I love that.
[00:34:18] Again, these are, and these are things
[00:34:20] that don't have to be necessarily expensive.
[00:34:22] They could even, you know, be free.
[00:34:24] There's certain ways you can celebrate people,
[00:34:27] you know, the things that are important in their life,
[00:34:29] it doesn't necessarily need to cost a lot,
[00:34:31] but it is something that most of the other service professionals
[00:34:34] in that consumer's life are not even gonna know about.
[00:34:37] They're not gonna know about their anniversary,
[00:34:39] they're not gonna know about their birthdays
[00:34:40] unless they happen to know
[00:34:42] and they get that automated email saying happy birthday.
[00:34:44] This is a real opportunity to really be able to touch somebody
[00:34:48] at, like Sarah was saying, at a deep emotional level
[00:34:51] and find out what's important to them
[00:34:53] and be there to celebrate with them
[00:34:56] and support them when they need it.
[00:34:59] So let's talk about the basics.
[00:35:01] So what are the basics of building a real estate business?
[00:35:05] Because I totally agree that this is the year
[00:35:08] to return to fundamentals
[00:35:10] because we know we can't control the market,
[00:35:12] we can't control inventory, we can't control rates,
[00:35:15] but we can control our activity.
[00:35:17] In fact, it's about the only thing we can control.
[00:35:19] So what are you doing right now just to stay busy?
[00:35:23] Yeah, so I try to just do the same things
[00:35:27] that I've been doing for the last 13 years
[00:35:29] and it's not rocket science
[00:35:31] and it's, I think social media is so great
[00:35:34] because it's an easy way to stay top of mind,
[00:35:36] but it's not everything.
[00:35:38] And I see a lot of agents or lenders or whatever it is
[00:35:41] that are maybe all in on social media
[00:35:42] and they are killing it and videos
[00:35:44] and that's all important, but then their sales don't reflect that.
[00:35:48] So it can't be the only piece, but it's a big piece.
[00:35:51] So I try to just post stories and videos
[00:35:54] and different posts that are engaging
[00:35:56] and not just something that, oh, there's a boring house
[00:35:59] that nobody really cares about.
[00:36:01] So I guess it's as a new agent,
[00:36:05] some things that I would have done differently
[00:36:07] aside from the Google reviews is I have a mailing list
[00:36:10] that's on an Excel spreadsheet,
[00:36:12] but I don't have an email list
[00:36:14] and that is ridiculous, I should.
[00:36:17] And so that's something that I'm going to be working on
[00:36:18] and something that I wish that I would have done 13 years ago.
[00:36:22] Email's not going away, of course.
[00:36:24] And so I think it's a big tool and a way to stay connected
[00:36:27] with people.
[00:36:27] So that's a goal of mine that I'm working on.
[00:36:30] Another thing for new agents is maybe you're not super busy
[00:36:33] right now and I have some friends that got in the business
[00:36:36] in 2020 and it was easy.
[00:36:38] They just answered their phone and we're selling houses
[00:36:42] because it was such a crazy market.
[00:36:44] Well, now it's harder again.
[00:36:45] And so I would join as many different networking groups,
[00:36:49] volunteer opportunities.
[00:36:50] It's all about at the beginning,
[00:36:52] it's not really what you know
[00:36:53] because you don't know a lot, it's who you know.
[00:36:55] And so how do you pair those two things
[00:36:57] with who I know while I'm learning everything I should know?
[00:37:00] Another really important thing I think is
[00:37:03] learning the contracts inside out forward backwards
[00:37:06] because I remember when I was 24
[00:37:09] and a very seasoned agent would challenge me
[00:37:11] on something in the contract.
[00:37:13] And I knew the answer and I knew I was right,
[00:37:15] but it's hard to have that confidence.
[00:37:17] So the more you can know the contract and say,
[00:37:20] okay, well, page four, paragraph nine
[00:37:21] talks about inspections and you might want to go back
[00:37:24] and read that.
[00:37:25] It feels a lot better when you know it
[00:37:27] and you know it for sure.
[00:37:28] So learning the forms, I joined our board early on
[00:37:32] on the forms committee for that reason.
[00:37:35] So that I could see how other agents
[00:37:36] were interpreting something and every forms,
[00:37:40] different interpretation by different attorneys
[00:37:42] or whoever it is.
[00:37:43] But I think the more that you can know the basics,
[00:37:46] the better off you'll be in the long run.
[00:37:48] I want to talk about this.
[00:37:50] So Sarah's talking about joining her volunteering,
[00:37:54] serving at her local association.
[00:37:56] You can also serve at the state level
[00:37:58] and of course at the national level.
[00:37:59] But the first place that people typically start
[00:38:02] is their local level.
[00:38:03] And so they reach out to their local association
[00:38:05] say, hey, do you have any committees
[00:38:07] that maybe need some members and you can apply.
[00:38:10] I know here in Chicago for the association,
[00:38:13] I belong to, there's 22 different committees,
[00:38:15] lots of opportunities there.
[00:38:17] And in addition to obviously serving the industry
[00:38:20] and learning more about the contracts,
[00:38:23] what also happens, and I'm curious to get Sarah's opinion,
[00:38:26] is you also get to meet all of the other really great people
[00:38:29] in the industry who are wanting to be of service,
[00:38:31] you get to develop relationships with them
[00:38:33] and that only will help you as you continue to do deals
[00:38:37] because you may run across a deal with that person
[00:38:39] and again, just having a good connection with them,
[00:38:43] being similarly minded, being like,
[00:38:45] hey, I volunteer at the association with you,
[00:38:48] that is going to help influence indirectly a deal.
[00:38:53] Yes, yeah, I think it's important to meet as many agents
[00:38:57] as you can when you're new.
[00:38:59] We as an agent that's out been 13 years,
[00:39:02] there's constantly new agents
[00:39:03] and especially in the last couple of years.
[00:39:06] So not all of them make it.
[00:39:07] And I think it's just the more people you can know
[00:39:10] the better just from a sphere of influence standpoint.
[00:39:14] Yeah, I agree.
[00:39:15] I wanted to ask about social media just one thing about it
[00:39:18] because I know it's important to you,
[00:39:20] you don't over focus on it, which some agents do.
[00:39:23] But you mentioned posting content that was helpful.
[00:39:27] What types of content, whether it's video or static posts,
[00:39:31] are you posting is it more about your life
[00:39:33] and what you deal with as a non-reelter
[00:39:36] or is it more real estate related or is it a mix?
[00:39:39] Mostly real estate related.
[00:39:40] I do try to throw in my kids every once in a while
[00:39:43] or a funny story of something that happened
[00:39:45] just to make it personal.
[00:39:47] I think people sometimes you can get on social media
[00:39:50] and it's all just real estate, real estate, real estate.
[00:39:52] And when someone Googles Sarah DeWolf REALTOR,
[00:39:55] I want them to know me.
[00:39:56] And so I'm trying to get better at video
[00:39:58] and that's kind of a goal for this coming year
[00:40:01] is to really focus more on just being out there
[00:40:04] for people to see me more, not necessarily the houses
[00:40:06] that I'm selling, even though that's important as well.
[00:40:09] Great, so that makes sense.
[00:40:11] And I also want to highlight this point
[00:40:12] is Sarah is a top, top producer
[00:40:15] and doesn't have an email list.
[00:40:16] So guys, you don't have to be, you won't be perfect.
[00:40:21] There's always going to be systems that aren't in place.
[00:40:24] And Sarah's like, hey, 13 years,
[00:40:26] I don't really have a good email list,
[00:40:28] but that's a really easily solvable problem, right?
[00:40:30] She can literally just contact every single person
[00:40:33] and she's ever done a deal with
[00:40:34] and said, yeah, I'm just updating my records, I need that.
[00:40:36] So obviously every problem has a solution,
[00:40:39] but guys, I also want you to know that people
[00:40:42] at the very top, they have issues too.
[00:40:44] There's things Sarah is a crazy success
[00:40:47] and yet she doesn't have an email list.
[00:40:49] And I'm not doing saying that to pick up her.
[00:40:52] I'm saying it to humanize her.
[00:40:53] Yes, right.
[00:40:54] Yes, everybody is perfect.
[00:40:55] It's not all perfect.
[00:40:56] Yeah, and it's always workable.
[00:40:58] Yeah, it's always workable.
[00:40:59] It's taking things and scaling and...
[00:41:02] Yeah, and this is where when you take a step back
[00:41:04] in your business and you say,
[00:41:06] oh, there's the thing I don't have.
[00:41:07] I need to work on that as opposed to just
[00:41:10] all the things flying at you, customer service related
[00:41:13] during the day.
[00:41:15] That eat up a lot of time and then it's hard to step,
[00:41:18] take a step back.
[00:41:18] So important to look at all of your systems.
[00:41:23] What...
[00:41:25] Wanted to get one more idea.
[00:41:27] So if you were a brand new agent today,
[00:41:30] you talked about social media,
[00:41:31] talked about obviously building up your sphere.
[00:41:35] What would you tell a new agent today to do?
[00:41:38] Join as many different volunteer opportunities that you can.
[00:41:42] And that's mostly because in the beginning,
[00:41:44] you might not be on appointments all day long.
[00:41:46] You're at the office kind of, okay,
[00:41:48] twiddling your thumbs on what to do.
[00:41:49] So it's a way to get out there because when you're new,
[00:41:52] you might not have the money to donate,
[00:41:54] but you have your time.
[00:41:55] And so that is the big thing that I would do
[00:41:58] is join as many different committees
[00:42:00] or volunteer things that you can.
[00:42:03] Google reviews, you want them to come from your clients
[00:42:06] and things, but even if you need to get a few
[00:42:08] from your boyfriend or your best friend, do it.
[00:42:11] So those two things, and then I,
[00:42:14] from my own personal experience,
[00:42:16] I would do an email list right away,
[00:42:18] as well as the mailing list.
[00:42:19] And that's been big for me from the beginning
[00:42:21] as my mailing list.
[00:42:23] Yeah, we're talking about branding.
[00:42:24] We're talking about doing repeatable actions
[00:42:26] that will over time get your clients
[00:42:30] to associate you with real estate,
[00:42:32] especially if you're newer.
[00:42:33] And it's easy to poo poo the refrigerator magnet idea
[00:42:37] just because it's such an old idea.
[00:42:39] However, if you do think about it,
[00:42:42] you want something that they're gonna see constantly
[00:42:46] with your name on it.
[00:42:47] And that is about as good of a gift as any
[00:42:50] because everyone's in the fridge all day long.
[00:42:53] So this idea of seeing your name constantly
[00:42:56] is it really is a good idea.
[00:42:59] Not, you know, not everyone puts fridge magnets up,
[00:43:01] but for people who do, they want,
[00:43:03] they will see your name and that's a good thing.
[00:43:05] And I've done it for so long now that every fall,
[00:43:08] when it gets to be obvious,
[00:43:09] my clients are like, where is it?
[00:43:11] When's it coming?
[00:43:11] And then they post it and then I share it.
[00:43:13] And so it's just kind of a fun thing
[00:43:15] that ends up paying for itself easily.
[00:43:17] Yeah, I mean, the downside is you'll have to do it
[00:43:19] the rest of your career, the upside is it works.
[00:43:21] Thank you for your name.
[00:43:24] Yeah, brilliant, brilliant idea.
[00:43:27] Well, I think this is a great,
[00:43:28] you've given us so much good information.
[00:43:30] I think this is a great place to wrap up.
[00:43:32] By the way, if is, are you looking to add any members
[00:43:37] to your team currently or are you happy
[00:43:39] with your production and just gonna work on your own stuff?
[00:43:43] Yeah, yeah, no, we opened a local real office
[00:43:47] called Bicell Build Quad Cities.
[00:43:48] And so we are looking to grow that as well as real.
[00:43:51] And I'm happy to just answer any questions
[00:43:53] if I can help anyone.
[00:43:55] So reach out to me, send me a message on Instagram
[00:43:58] or an email, I'll respond and send you the expired listing
[00:44:01] or anything that I can help with.
[00:44:03] That's awesome.
[00:44:04] And if you're an agent in the Quad Cities
[00:44:06] and maybe isn't getting the help that they deserve or need,
[00:44:09] real is an awesome company too.
[00:44:10] I'm a big fan of theirs and they have some cool incentives
[00:44:13] that other firms typically don't have.
[00:44:15] So give, reach out to Sarah.
[00:44:18] She will have all of her contact information in the show notes
[00:44:22] and also please follow her on Instagram,
[00:44:24] which is Sarah DeWolf QC REALTOR.
[00:44:27] Again, that'll be in the show notes as well
[00:44:29] and visit her website, which is,
[00:44:32] Sarah just lost your website, I'm sorry.
[00:44:34] It's okay, it's SarahDeWolfRealtor.com.
[00:44:36] That's it, SarahDeWolfRealtor.com.
[00:44:39] On behalf of our audience, Sarah,
[00:44:40] thank you so much for your time today.
[00:44:42] You are a really impressive agent, mother,
[00:44:47] and business owner, in fact multiple different businesses.
[00:44:52] And so it's just amazing how you're able to do all of that
[00:44:55] and also be of service to our podcast.
[00:44:58] So thank you.
[00:44:59] Thank you.
[00:45:00] Yeah, and on behalf of Sarah and myself,
[00:45:02] we want to thank our audience.
[00:45:03] We just crossed over to the front.
[00:45:05] Yeah, thanks.
[00:45:06] We just crossed over the 500 episode mark.
[00:45:09] We are so grateful to all of you.

Guys, let's just get to the main event. Thanks for 500 episodes and hopefully another 500 in the upcoming years. And let's get to it. My conversation with Sarah DeWolf. Okay, today on the show, our guest is Sarah DeWolf from with real in the Quad Cities. For those of you not from the Midwest, what are the Quad Cities? There are four cities that sit right on the Illinois Iowa border. So she is licensed in both Illinois. And I think that's the best way to get the best out of it. Iowa, but let me tell you more about Sarah. Now Sarah DeWolf is a licensed REALTOR both Illinois and Iowa since 2010. She is consistently among the top agents in the Quad Cities. 22, 22, two stats include selling over 36 million enclosed volume with 117 transactions. That's one every three days, amazing. And as an individual agent, she did that. Now she's also ranked in the prestigious Tom Ferry, the thousand best REALTORS in the country. She ranks number 195. She's in the top point, 0 1% of agents in the United States. And when she's not working, Sarah and her husband have two toddlers. They own a local young lumber yard, rental properties, and an Airbnb. This is a busy woman and I'm excited to chat with her. Sarah, welcome to the show. Thank you for having me. I'm tired just thinking about that. Well, I'm tired reading it. But I love that expression. I've probably said it in a million times on the show is if you want something done, give it to a busy mother. They just get everything done. But everyone follow Sarah on Instagram. Sarah DeWolf, that's DE. First of all, it's S-A-R-A-D-E-W-U-L-F-Q-C REALTOR. Yeah, Quad Cities. So guys, don't worry. It'll link to it in the show notes. Sarah DeWolf, QC REALTOR on Instagram. And we'll also have a link to our website, which is Sarah DeWolf Realtor.com. Sarah, I'm so excited to have you. Tell us, you got into the market in 2010. Not the easiest time to get into the market. So I want to hear about what that experience was like because we have a lot of agents today getting in right now. And it's not quite as awful as it was back then, but it is still a challenging time. So tell us about how you got started and why. Sure. So at the time in 2010, I was in college and my major was psychology. My dad was a REALTOR, so I am a second generation REALTOR. He was a managing broker for our offices and said, you should get into real estate. And so it wasn't something that I grew up thinking that I was going to do. And he did it for 20 years. And so I watched him and I always was interested in real estate, but I didn't know that that was the path I was going to go down. However, I didn't want to do school anymore. I didn't want to get my masters or PhD and psychology does come in handy every day with real estate. So it worked out. So him and I worked together. We would do all of our listings together and buyers separately. So it was kind of a, we weren't really a team, but sort of. We were the father-daughter team on listings. And so it was nice because he taught me everything I know. And we would drive around all day to different appointments and I would listen to him and listen to 45 different agents calling him with headaches. And so I felt like I was on a fast track to learning this business, which every day is different. And now 13 years in, I'm still learning things, of course. And each deal has different things that you've got to kind of work through. So he passed away in 2019. And it was pretty unexpected. He was in a surgery and I looked at my husband and we didn't know if he was going to make it out of that surgery. And I looked at my husband and said, what am I going to do? Because it had always just been him and I. He didn't die that night, thankfully, but I had two more weeks with him and he did, unfortunately, pass away. So I had to quickly pick up the pieces and I knew for sure that he wouldn't want me sitting around crying. So I just went right to work and figured out how am I going to really do this without him. So that was in 2019. And that year I had sold 12 million in sales and 2020. I sold 23 million. So I almost doubled my sales. Thank you. And grew it ever since then. So I hope he's looking down and proud, but he is certainly missed, but how lucky am I that I had such a great teacher for 10 years. Yeah, life is a mixture of tragedy and fortunate events. And it's just this dance of peaks and valleys and we all go through it. And yeah, my heart goes out to you for losing your father. We're all going to do it someday. We're all going to lose our parents and it's a scariest thing ever. But I also, you also had some health issue yourself that came at a very young age. And if you don't mind sharing that, I'm curious because what I'm curious about is how that experience maybe shaped you into who you are today. Because it was a pretty serious one, if you don't mind. Yeah, absolutely. So I had melanoma. I had a mole on my arm that didn't look great, but at the time I was 26 and that it's probably nothing. And so I ended up going in probably way later than I should have. And they took the mole off and said, oh, best case scenario, we caught it early stage 1A. We'll remove it. And then they said, but because of the age, we're going to test a couple lymph nodes just to make sure. Well, they did that and it, two of the lymph nodes tested positive. So for whatever reason, the type of cancer that I had, they could see actively splitting under a microscope. So it was moving very, very quickly. So I quickly went from stage 1A to stage 3B, which is much more serious. So I had to do a lot of scans and luckily it hadn't spread. Past my lymph nodes, we caught it kind of just in time. So I had several surgeries and that was a, that was a rough time. It was, I was probably three years into the business. And so it was starting to get more consistent, but not quite. And so between just being scared to death, literally, am I going to survive this? And I was dating my husband at the time, but we weren't married. And so that was about a year long of going back and forth to Iowa City to the hospital there and just making sure that everything was okay. And thank God no issues sense. And that was, it'll be 10 years in February. But it changed my life. I can tell you that for sure. Yeah, what did, obviously, significant events like that do tend to change people's perspective or maybe even change their goals or the things that are important the things that are important to them, their values. How did that change here? I've always been a don't sweat the small stuff type of person, but even more so now it's little things that aren't going to matter in five years or an agent just makes you so mad. You want to call and yell at them or say, this isn't right, but is it worth it? Is it going to change anything? No. So it's just a matter of taking a day at a time and being so grateful for my health. That at 26, it hits you different when you start to think, am I going to make it? And you really don't think about that and your 20 is very often. And really without our health, we have nothing. So all these little things, stressors in life, if you're happy, if your family's healthy, that's all that matters. Yeah, I was having a moment last night where I was starting to judge myself unfairly. I was thinking about something in my life that I don't have as much of as I want and I was cooking and I really enjoy cooking. And I was making this meal that I'd never made before. It was kind of a fun thing. But I was sitting there going, gosh, I don't have this in that. And I'm such a loser, whatever. The things that negative self-thought. And I realized, I said, well, but I have this moment where I'm cooking and why am I, like I could enjoy this moment while I'm cooking. I can get back to beating myself up later. But I said, boy, I'm missing out on this fun thing I like to do just because I'm caught up in this judgment. So it is really important, I think, to monitor and pay attention, be mindful of what's going on inside of a specially around, as you mentioned, anger. I think a great rule of thumb in this industry and anger is going to come up because people just do goofy things and other REALTORS may do things that you don't like and your clients may do things that you don't like. But I always say, I don't make good decisions when I'm angry and I certainly don't have access to all my faculties and I can't make oftentimes the best logical decisions. So I think what you said was really great. It's like when you're angry, that's not right, really the time to communicate, right? Settle down first, rewires, it's like Sarah says, it may just be a small thing, even though it feels big in the moment, give yourself a breath and then respond. Let it go. Yes. Or just let it go. Let it go. Let it go. Yes, unless it's something where you can't let it go and you need to actually take action. But most of the time, most things resolve themselves. But Sarah, I want to learn more about you because you have to get licensed in two states, not the easiest thing or most fun thing to do, but based on the geography of where you practice, it is critical. And so you have to sort of know how to do deals on two different probably MLSs. I don't know if it's the same. It's the same MLS. Luckily, it's the same MLS. Oh, thank goodness, that makes it look easier. But I want to talk, you did 117 sales last year. That is insane. In the best possible compliment I could give somebody, you knocked out almost 40 million in production. And this is what you did yourself, which is crazy. Let's talk about how you did that. Yes, you had a father, great mentor, wonderful REALTOR. And you learned and developed your skills. But most people who even come from a family that was in real estate, they don't do 117 sales. In a year. So what's your secret? Not that there's a secret, but what's your, I hate to say that word. What's your strategy? Well, works. Yeah, it's been, so I had systems in place when I first started that I've tried to tweak over the years as Sharon Sarvatsis says just because it's tried and true doesn't mean that it's working right now. So I've advertised, I used to advertise on Zillow that 10 years ago that was huge for me. And I had a ton of customers come and clients come in that way. Now I would never advertise on Zillow. So it's little things along that I've just tried to tweak and get better. I should note that I also had a baby last year. And with that being said, I have an incredibly supportive husband and family and mom, and to which none of this would be possible without all of them. So it's not just me, but I really, to think two big things that my dad instilled in me is to create raving fans and that customer service is a lost art. And I always remember when I go to a hotel and they go above and beyond, maybe it's my birthday and there's a bottle of champagne in the room. And it's little things like that. If you do more than what the customer expects, I shouldn't say anyone, but most people could be a REALTOR. It's a lot harder than I think what people think. And it's hard to grow your business. And I also don't think that people sit down and say, okay, this is my business. I'm not just selling real estate. I'm creating a business and I'm in charge of that. Working on the business as opposed to in the businesses, all the stuff I need to do now, my clients, my prospecting, all of the activities. And then on the businesses, okay, let's take a step back and look at this as a business owner, where they're inefficiencies, where can I delegate, how can I make this whole process, all these processes run smoother? Yes, yes. And I guess it's been interesting from 2010 to now, seeing the difference in the market. And in the Quad Cities, we're lucky because we don't see these big huge drops in prices. We've been consistent as far as equity goes. And so that helps, but it's also not a big, it's not a huge town like Chicago, but with Iowa and Illinois, we've got quite a few people. So I guess it's just, it's important to look at your business and see what's working and what's not working and always be tweaking those systems. I think that, oh, go ahead. No, go ahead. I said, when I started and you don't have a lot of clients and I was 23 and so a lot of my friends weren't quite buying houses yet. And there's things that I know that I did write and there's, I guess, advice that I have, that I should have done. I should have been working on Google reviews from day one. I can't imagine how many I would have. Let's pause for a second. So I want to step in with this because we have about 800, just under 800 agents that are firm. And we didn't do much with Google reviews up until about maybe three years ago. And now what we do is we send the opportunity to do a Google review to every one of our broker or every one of our agents clients. So that we, you know, we just say, hey, let us know what you thought of your REALTOR. And we went from having almost no reviews to now we have, I think, six or 700. It's never too late to start everyone. This can work. Go ahead. This is a good story. So I had my previous brokerage, they used testimonial tree. And when I switched, I lost all of those. So I went to my Google page and I think I had 11 reviews, which is absolutely ridiculous for doing this for 13 years. So I knew I needed to do something in quick. So I have always been in a believer in mailings and not the traditional postcard that people are just going to throw in the trash. I try to stick to maybe three or four quarterly something that they're going to keep on their refrigerator. So in Iowa, we don't have a professional football team. So the hot guys are, everybody cheers for the hot guys. Or they should. So I sent out the football magnet and then I'm top of mind on their refrigerator all season long. I've sent out grocery magnets. All kinds of just different things. But one thing that I did recently is I needed Google reviews. So I sent out some things saying, I'm celebrating 13 years in business. Thank you for all your support. I'm going to be giving away. I think I did a solo stove, a pizza oven, a black stone. Kind of some cool things that I spent about $1,500. But I found it. Those are good gifts. Yeah, I sent it to my mailing list, which is about 500 people. It's past clients, but it's also just my sphere of influence. And I got 72 Google reviews. So that, yes. And so in my clients were so excited. They wrote the review, which probably didn't take a more than a minute. And when we drew their name, we sent anyone that filled one out. We sent, even if it's a $10 gift card ice cream or something, they got something. But it was a good way to quickly grow those Google reviews because reviews are so important. And everyone's going to Google you, even if they're your closest friends. They're still going to Google you, just because they want to see how you do or what other clients think about you. And Google is obviously top of the mountain for reviews. I would say Zello is probably number two for where people find reviews. So yes, it's a great idea. And it also helps with SEO, local SEO, in particular, meaning showing up on web searches when people are searching for REALTORS in their area. Google can make a general assumption that if somebody's got hundreds and hundreds of five-star reviews, odds are they're probably a pretty decent search result to serve up to a consumer who's looking. So yes, Google, my business, is the name of the platform. Or I think they changed the name. Now I think it's just Google business. But anyway, get yourself on Google. Why would you talk about referrals? Because, well, I'm going to talk about something that leads to referrals. You said, going above and beyond, can you give us a couple of examples of ways in which you do that? That maybe you think not every agent does? Sure. So most people don't buy in sell houses every day. So a lot of times, especially with first-time home buyers, they're intimidated and really don't know what to do. So it's amazing to me how many agents don't do buyers' consultations. And that is a must for me. So when someone calls and they're ready to buy a house, whether it's their first house or their 10th house, we sit down to talk about their goals. I give expectations on the market. What's to expect? And if you do an inspection and you want to ask for something, please know that it means the contract. So we don't want to ask for something small. Because a lot of times buyers want to renegotiate or whatever it ends up being. So I do different checkpoints through the process with them. We start with our buyers' consultation, assuming they're already pre-approved. We'll start shopping for houses. As we're shopping, I'm pointing out things. I'm certainly not an inspector, but I see a lot of inspection so I can say, hey, this might come up, just be prepared. Then I have a full-time assistant, shout out, Kerry. I could not do this without her. She is amazing. And so she does different checkpoints. Like when we get closer to closing, it's, hey, Sarah wanted me to remind you to switch utilities and its links to all the utilities, even internet cable, all those things. Or, and then two weeks after closing, we send out an email saying, hey, just a reminder, make sure you sign up for that Homestead tax credit. So I try to just make the process as simple as possible for them, but also not to, I don't, I've never looked at my business as transactional. I've always just said yes to everything. And I think that that is in part of big, I guess it's a big part of my success. I see a lot of new agents that get so caught up in price point. And I don't wanna go show that $60,000 house. Well, the person that's buying the $60,000 house has family and friends. And if you can create a raving fan, like my dad said, they're gonna tell all their friends and family what a great experience they had with you. So that's been really important to me is how do I make sure that my buyers and sellers have the best experience and that I'm giving them best case scenario, worst case scenario, and enough information for them to make an informed decision. So right now the market is, thank you for all of that by the way. That was all just exactly the way I feel about what REALTORS ought to do for customer service and going above and beyond is, it's what I think M. Scott Peck wrote, it's never crowded along the extra mile or someone wrote that book, but he's right. It's literally not that crowded on the extra mile. And it doesn't mean you have to, you know, sprints a mile for somebody. It does not mean that. It just means going a little bit beyond what they would expect. You know, it's as simple as just knowing what's going on in your client's lives and reaching out to them from time to time to check in on them and ask about their kids or whatever they're dealing with as a family or business. But the market is shifted. So we have interest rates in the eights at this point. If you're lucky in the high sevens and there's the vast majority of homeowners in this country have a under a four percent mortgage at this point. In fact, I think it's like 90% have under a four percent mortgage. So there's not a big incentive for people to move unless they have to. So I'm curious about what you're doing to stay positive, stay productive and just keep your business chugging along right now. Yeah. Social media, I think, is our biggest tool as agents and I'll get into a little bit on, well, with social media, I think that it is the most important thing that we can be posting to, and people get so caught up in rates and obviously it's very impactful into our market. But usually what I tell people when they get nervous about it is if you're comfortable with the payment, the interest rate shouldn't matter too much. And people sign up for 27% credit cards every day. So if you love the house, that is a great point. So if you love the house and you can afford it, buy it. Always reply. And by the way, don't sign up for 27% credit cards, everybody. Yes, especially while you're buying a house. Yes, yes. And if you are somebody that doesn't pay their entire balance off every month, then yes, do not sign up for it. But there is so absolutely right. You're right, the rate isn't that important, but what the rate can do is still drive people away. So you know that the rate isn't as relevant, but the consumer might feel like, oh, I missed the bow a couple of years ago, I could have gotten in for 2.9. So what is your, does that happen? Do you come across people like that? Oh, yeah, constantly. And a lot of people sometimes it doesn't make sense for them to move right now. If it's going to be a lateral move to a small, even a smaller house based on a 2.9% interest rate, then we just pause it. I guess for me, it's the way that I've kept things moving is I try to remind people to not get their local real estate advice from the news. The news is going to talk about its doomsday and houses aren't selling and that isn't true at all. We still very much are in an inventory issue, at least in Iowa and Illinois in the Quad Cities. So things are selling really quickly. So one thing that I've done well for 13 years is every Tuesday I send out expired letters. So I go through the last seven days of expired listings and we know those people want to sell their house or they wouldn't have put it for sale. And sometimes circumstances change, but I would say that I get, I don't know, two to four listings a year from that. And a lot of times it's just, they picked, they just called any agent and maybe didn't have a good experience or maybe their house just wasn't marketed properly. But to me in this market, at least here everything is selling. So an expired listing is a really good way to get a new listing. So I started that 13 years ago and it still works. That's amazing. So I'm gonna break this down for anyone who's not familiar with what expires are. So these are obviously listings that have expired and there are services that you can subscribe to for really very inexpensive pricing that will serve you up daily here are the expires or you can obviously look on your MLS system and set up searches for that. But a lot of companies will provide these daily leads to you. The problem is they sell those leads to lots of different agents. And so what Sarah is doing that's very unique is typically when people hear, maybe you should call expires is that calling process. I'm gonna call the homeowner and that can work. It certainly can work. The challenge is that homeowners probably getting a lot of phone calls, especially when those leads become available because when it expires all these lead companies push it out to all of the people that are purchasing them. And so the person might get 10 phone calls in a day. You might be number eight and they're gonna be like, oh, stop calling. It has nothing to do with you. So it's Sarah does, which is really a lot softer is she sends a mail or out. Do you do like a letter or postcard? What was it? It's just a letter and it's at, it's addressed right to them in handwriting, but the letter itself is tight. Yes. And so it's very simple too, maybe three paragraphs of just a note, non-obligation. We can get together, kind of talk about different strategies. And it works. And I'd be happy to share it with anyone that's listening. So feel free to email or shoot me a message. Please do, that is so generous. We'll provide Sarah's contact information in the show notes so you can reach out to her to get her expired letter. Although if you're in her market area, let's not do that. But anywhere else, yeah, I'm only teasing. There are no secrets in real estate, but we are so grateful that you share that. And so this is really smart. And I wanna break this down just a little bit further. So every Tuesday or once a week, Sarah sends, yeah, every Tuesday, Sarah sees all the expires that have come in in the past week and she sends this letter out hand writes the envelope because what do we know? Handwritten envelopes get opened. Regular envelopes get thrown away. So handwrite your envelopes inside, just a standard letter. And Sarah said she gets anywhere from two to four listings a year. Now that might not sound like a lot for sending on all those mailers. By the way, a lot of these lead companies that send you expires can also send out mailers for you, although I don't know if they can do the handwriting. So Sarah does that manually, which is probably the better way to do it. But you could technically automate it if you really wanted to. But the idea is that this is still a cash flow positive marketing expense because if she's sending out mailers, I'm assuming it still nets you two to four deals a year has got to pay for all of the mailers I'm guessing. Easily, yes. Easily. So it's kind of a no-brainer. There's no reason to not do it. And it doesn't require that much work you're assistant I'm assuming does the majority of the heavy lifting there. Boy, that is such a brilliant strategy, guys. She just gave you a basically something that should pay for itself. Now every market's different. And maybe if you're in Metro, Chicago, maybe that's different than a more rural area. Sarah is not necessarily in a rural area, but a much smaller group of cities. So perhaps the, you know, but I don't know maybe the competition is even more fierce where she is too. But regardless, it's a heck of a good idea. And you just got to go try it for like two years. I'd say if you do it for two years, I'd be shocked if you didn't get. And use her letter. She's going to give you the exact letter she uses that literally wins business. So please reach out to her. That is awesome. So now that things have changed with respect to where the market is, what are some of the things? So in addition to expires, you know, what are you doing for a rural perspective? Like how are you staying in touch with your sphere? So the biggest thing that I do after every closing is add any of the clients on social media. It's the best way to keep in touch and to be, you always want to be top of mind awareness. So when someone asks, hey, who's the REALTOR you would call? I'm number one. The biggest thing that I didn't want to happen is that we closed the transaction and they never hear from me again. And five years later, what was her name again? And I don't want that. So I, another thing that I do is if I have clients that maybe I sold a house to them five years ago and they got married, I'll, I don't know if you know what small woods is, but it's a, it's an online, if there's a wedding photo, it goes in a wood frame and it's customized to them and you can make them any size. And so whether they live here or they live, some, they've moved away, we'll mail that to their house. And it's probably, I don't know, 50 or $60 maybe. So it's not the cheapest, but it's also not the most expensive. And it has the biggest impact because it's so emotional. It's, oh my gosh, this is our family. It's, it's a great thing to hang in their house. So how do you get the photo? How do you get the photo? If they post it on Facebook. So I see, so you, so you don't ask for it. You just search through social media, you see if they have some sort of engagement photo or wedding photo or something that they seem to think is, is important to them. And then you take that photo and you just do this without them even knowing and you just shows up on their door. You just shows up at their door and says, congratulations, wishing you a lifetime of happiness. And same with babies, that's another big one. So I, the biggest blessing I think in real estate is clients that become friends. And not everyone, of course, but the majority I would say become my friend. And it's important to be a good friend. It's not just real estate, but I also want to be the person that, if they move here and they know no one, hey, who's a good doctor? Where should I get my hair done? Just little things that I can maybe answer for them or give them suggestions. I want to be there, go to and all things real estate. By the way, Sarah is the go to for dermatologists in her area because of her. I certainly am. Sorry, that was, that was an easy joke. I just had to say. Yes. But it is, but it is a really good point. By the way, everybody get your annual dermatologist appointment. And in fact, here's a little pro tip. Don't leave the office before scheduling the next years because you're going to forget. That's what I do every year. Never leave a doctor's office without scheduling the next appointment. Otherwise, if you're like me, you won't remember. But it's really important because if I was moving to the Quad cities, I would need a dermatologist. I would need a bunch of doctors. Right? A general person, I might need a sports medicine person. And I wouldn't know where to go. I mean, I guess you can look that up online sort of. But I'd much rather have referrals. And so you want to be the, I'm guessing you want to be the hub of all things, service related, whether it's real estate or not for your clients. Is that accurate? Yes. Yes. And mostly it's, I want to keep the relationship going after closing. So that six months down the road, three years down the road, whatever it is, we're still touching base the whole way through. By the way, back to the, the, the small woods, the small wood idea, which I'm looking at it right now, I pulled it up while you were talking. Sarah does this on an anniversary, but you don't even have to do it on an anniversary. Like it literally could be done at any time. So it's something that if you're like, I don't know when my clients anniversary is, no problem, just find a picture of them, send it to them randomly. They will, in fact, maybe even not on their anniversary would be, maybe more unexpected, although on their anniversary is amazing as well. But and that's the other thing too, is everyone should know this information. You should reach out to your clients and say, hey, you know, I like to know wedding anniversaries so that I can possibly, you know, send something. So if you need to get that information, you can literally just ask your clients for it. I don't think anyone would, would say, I don't want you to have that information. You want to know what the children's ages are. You want to know major life events stuff. So did they get a new job? Did they, you know, are they moving? Obviously, it's important. But, you know, these are important things because if Sarah knows that somebody's child is, you know, a junior in high school, well, they're probably looking at colleges or maybe, you know, depending on the family, that may be something they're doing. So she now knows, oh, well, maybe I could do something nice for them, you know, when she's ready to leave for college or whatever. The important part is she, Sarah now has information. She can choose to do something with, which is, this is all the fun stuff of real estate too, right? Yes, right. Yeah. I'm trying to think of anything. Oh, closing gifts are another big deal. I think a lot of times agents either forget or don't want to do that. And it really kind of seals the deal for me, I feel like where I would say nine times out of 10 if they don't already have some sort of like ring doorbell. I give a ring doorbell at closing and sometimes a gift card to a local restaurant. I try to never forget kids and dogs. So they'll be, we have a place called Freddy's Fritters here and it's a custom dog treat company. So we'll throw in treats for them or ice cream for the kids, something so that they know that I care about their family and I'm really excited for them on their purchase or their sale. Yeah, I love that. Again, these are, and these are things that don't have to be necessarily expensive. They could even, you know, be free. There's certain ways you can celebrate people, you know, the things that are important in their life, it doesn't necessarily need to cost a lot, but it is something that most of the other service professionals in that consumer's life are not even gonna know about. They're not gonna know about their anniversary, they're not gonna know about their birthdays unless they happen to know and they get that automated email saying happy birthday. This is a real opportunity to really be able to touch somebody at, like Sarah was saying, at a deep emotional level and find out what's important to them and be there to celebrate with them and support them when they need it. So let's talk about the basics. So what are the basics of building a real estate business? Because I totally agree that this is the year to return to fundamentals because we know we can't control the market, we can't control inventory, we can't control rates, but we can control our activity. In fact, it's about the only thing we can control. So what are you doing right now just to stay busy? Yeah, so I try to just do the same things that I've been doing for the last 13 years and it's not rocket science and it's, I think social media is so great because it's an easy way to stay top of mind, but it's not everything. And I see a lot of agents or lenders or whatever it is that are maybe all in on social media and they are killing it and videos and that's all important, but then their sales don't reflect that. So it can't be the only piece, but it's a big piece. So I try to just post stories and videos and different posts that are engaging and not just something that, oh, there's a boring house that nobody really cares about. So I guess it's as a new agent, some things that I would have done differently aside from the Google reviews is I have a mailing list that's on an Excel spreadsheet, but I don't have an email list and that is ridiculous, I should. And so that's something that I'm going to be working on and something that I wish that I would have done 13 years ago. Email's not going away, of course. And so I think it's a big tool and a way to stay connected with people. So that's a goal of mine that I'm working on. Another thing for new agents is maybe you're not super busy right now and I have some friends that got in the business in 2020 and it was easy. They just answered their phone and we're selling houses because it was such a crazy market. Well, now it's harder again. And so I would join as many different networking groups, volunteer opportunities. It's all about at the beginning, it's not really what you know because you don't know a lot, it's who you know. And so how do you pair those two things with who I know while I'm learning everything I should know? Another really important thing I think is learning the contracts inside out forward backwards because I remember when I was 24 and a very seasoned agent would challenge me on something in the contract. And I knew the answer and I knew I was right, but it's hard to have that confidence. So the more you can know the contract and say, okay, well, page four, paragraph nine talks about inspections and you might want to go back and read that. It feels a lot better when you know it and you know it for sure. So learning the forms, I joined our board early on on the forms committee for that reason. So that I could see how other agents were interpreting something and every forms, different interpretation by different attorneys or whoever it is. But I think the more that you can know the basics, the better off you'll be in the long run. I want to talk about this. So Sarah's talking about joining her volunteering, serving at her local association. You can also serve at the state level and of course at the national level. But the first place that people typically start is their local level. And so they reach out to their local association say, hey, do you have any committees that maybe need some members and you can apply. I know here in Chicago for the association, I belong to, there's 22 different committees, lots of opportunities there. And in addition to obviously serving the industry and learning more about the contracts, what also happens, and I'm curious to get Sarah's opinion, is you also get to meet all of the other really great people in the industry who are wanting to be of service, you get to develop relationships with them and that only will help you as you continue to do deals because you may run across a deal with that person and again, just having a good connection with them, being similarly minded, being like, hey, I volunteer at the association with you, that is going to help influence indirectly a deal. Yes, yeah, I think it's important to meet as many agents as you can when you're new. We as an agent that's out been 13 years, there's constantly new agents and especially in the last couple of years. So not all of them make it. And I think it's just the more people you can know the better just from a sphere of influence standpoint. Yeah, I agree. I wanted to ask about social media just one thing about it because I know it's important to you, you don't over focus on it, which some agents do. But you mentioned posting content that was helpful. What types of content, whether it's video or static posts, are you posting is it more about your life and what you deal with as a non-reelter or is it more real estate related or is it a mix? Mostly real estate related. I do try to throw in my kids every once in a while or a funny story of something that happened just to make it personal. I think people sometimes you can get on social media and it's all just real estate, real estate, real estate. And when someone Googles Sarah DeWolf REALTOR, I want them to know me. And so I'm trying to get better at video and that's kind of a goal for this coming year is to really focus more on just being out there for people to see me more, not necessarily the houses that I'm selling, even though that's important as well. Great, so that makes sense. And I also want to highlight this point is Sarah is a top, top producer and doesn't have an email list. So guys, you don't have to be, you won't be perfect. There's always going to be systems that aren't in place. And Sarah's like, hey, 13 years, I don't really have a good email list, but that's a really easily solvable problem, right? She can literally just contact every single person and she's ever done a deal with and said, yeah, I'm just updating my records, I need that. So obviously every problem has a solution, but guys, I also want you to know that people at the very top, they have issues too. There's things Sarah is a crazy success and yet she doesn't have an email list. And I'm not doing saying that to pick up her. I'm saying it to humanize her. Yes, right. Yes, everybody is perfect. It's not all perfect. Yeah, and it's always workable. Yeah, it's always workable. It's taking things and scaling and... Yeah, and this is where when you take a step back in your business and you say, oh, there's the thing I don't have. I need to work on that as opposed to just all the things flying at you, customer service related during the day. That eat up a lot of time and then it's hard to step, take a step back. So important to look at all of your systems. What... Wanted to get one more idea. So if you were a brand new agent today, you talked about social media, talked about obviously building up your sphere. What would you tell a new agent today to do? Join as many different volunteer opportunities that you can. And that's mostly because in the beginning, you might not be on appointments all day long. You're at the office kind of, okay, twiddling your thumbs on what to do. So it's a way to get out there because when you're new, you might not have the money to donate, but you have your time. And so that is the big thing that I would do is join as many different committees or volunteer things that you can. Google reviews, you want them to come from your clients and things, but even if you need to get a few from your boyfriend or your best friend, do it. So those two things, and then I, from my own personal experience, I would do an email list right away, as well as the mailing list. And that's been big for me from the beginning as my mailing list. Yeah, we're talking about branding. We're talking about doing repeatable actions that will over time get your clients to associate you with real estate, especially if you're newer. And it's easy to poo poo the refrigerator magnet idea just because it's such an old idea. However, if you do think about it, you want something that they're gonna see constantly with your name on it. And that is about as good of a gift as any because everyone's in the fridge all day long. So this idea of seeing your name constantly is it really is a good idea. Not, you know, not everyone puts fridge magnets up, but for people who do, they want, they will see your name and that's a good thing. And I've done it for so long now that every fall, when it gets to be obvious, my clients are like, where is it? When's it coming? And then they post it and then I share it. And so it's just kind of a fun thing that ends up paying for itself easily. Yeah, I mean, the downside is you'll have to do it the rest of your career, the upside is it works. Thank you for your name. Yeah, brilliant, brilliant idea. Well, I think this is a great, you've given us so much good information. I think this is a great place to wrap up. By the way, if is, are you looking to add any members to your team currently or are you happy with your production and just gonna work on your own stuff? Yeah, yeah, no, we opened a local real office called Bicell Build Quad Cities. And so we are looking to grow that as well as real. And I'm happy to just answer any questions if I can help anyone. So reach out to me, send me a message on Instagram or an email, I'll respond and send you the expired listing or anything that I can help with. That's awesome. And if you're an agent in the Quad Cities and maybe isn't getting the help that they deserve or need, real is an awesome company too. I'm a big fan of theirs and they have some cool incentives that other firms typically don't have. So give, reach out to Sarah.
