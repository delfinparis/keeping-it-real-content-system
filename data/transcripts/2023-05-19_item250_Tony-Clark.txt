[00:02:00] you know, pieces of content from our guests.
[00:02:02] So the best way to find these is just to find us
[00:02:05] on social media.
[00:02:06] We are literally on all the platforms,
[00:02:08] not my space and not Google Plus, obviously.
[00:02:11] But on all the other, you know, Facebook, Instagram,

[00:02:42] We appreciate you.
[00:02:44] All right, guys, let's get to the main event.
[00:02:46] My conversation with Tony Clark.
[00:03:01] Today on the show, we have Tony Clark,
[00:03:04] from Beverly and Company in California,
[00:03:06] also with House Haven in Tennessee.
[00:03:10] Let me tell you more about Tony.
[00:03:12] Now Tony is a real estate agent with a background
[00:03:15] in both real estate sales and investment real estate strategy.
[00:03:19] Now this is incredible, everyone.
[00:03:21] So please, please check this out.
[00:03:23] In his first 18 months as a REALTOR,
[00:03:26] he closed over 40 million in volume.
[00:03:29] He also realized the importance that good systems make
[00:03:32] in a real estate agents business.
[00:03:34] And as since opened up his own consulting firm dedicated
[00:03:37] to helping agents improve their systems
[00:03:39] and to scale their businesses,
[00:03:41] and he even has his own CRM that is dropping,
[00:03:45] probably by the time this episode is released,
[00:03:47] it'll be available.
[00:03:49] So I want you to check out Tony in a couple of different places.
[00:03:51] First, I want you to follow him on Instagram.
[00:03:53] So follow him at TonyClark.realestate.
[00:03:56] We'll have a link to that in the show notes.
[00:03:58] And I also really want you to check out his new CRM.
[00:04:01] And we're going to find out more about that today as well,
[00:04:04] which is realtiflo.io.
[00:04:06] Again, realtiflo.io link to that will also be in the show notes.
[00:04:11] Tony, welcome to the show.
[00:04:13] Hey, thanks for having me.
[00:04:14] I'm excited to be here.
[00:04:17] I'm excited to talk to you.
[00:04:19] I rarely, it's funny.
[00:04:22] I've been doing this show for five or six years now.
[00:04:24] And I always feel like I've seen and heard it all
[00:04:26] from our guests who are all superstars in the industry.
[00:04:30] But rarely do I get to talk to a lawyer like a rookie superstar.
[00:04:33] And not only did you close 40 million in your first year
[00:04:36] and a half, which is insane, obviously.
[00:04:38] But you also are practicing now in two states and two markets,
[00:04:43] which is even more incredible.
[00:04:44] I know you're mostly in California,
[00:04:46] but you also practice in Tennessee Nashville as well.
[00:04:50] So let's get, let's start at the very, very beginning,
[00:04:52] which is not a much that long ago.
[00:04:55] But I'd love to know how you got into real estate and why.
[00:04:59] Yeah, I jumped into real estate actually
[00:05:02] from the investment space.
[00:05:04] I worked at a private equity firm that did residential real estate,
[00:05:08] just kind of wanted to learn the ropes.
[00:05:09] I was all the way back when I was a kid.
[00:05:12] I was that kid trying to sell baseball cards to his friends
[00:05:14] or try to flip golf clubs in high school.
[00:05:17] You know, just the stereotypical business-minded kid.
[00:05:20] And I always say houses are just bigger toys
[00:05:22] than the stuff that we sell growing up.
[00:05:26] But yes, so started at a private equity fund,
[00:05:30] kind of learning the investment side.
[00:05:32] They were based out of California,
[00:05:34] but bought in different markets in the southeast.
[00:05:36] And so I was essentially acting as a real estate agent
[00:05:40] for them, but just sourcing properties for them
[00:05:42] and running deal analysis and really got a lot of good experience
[00:05:48] there, but realized pretty quickly that basically,
[00:05:51] what I was doing for them was being a real estate agent
[00:05:54] who could only have one client.
[00:05:55] And so I wound up transitioning from the fund
[00:06:00] to getting my license and actually wound up moving to Tennessee
[00:06:06] with my wife after I got licensed
[00:06:08] so that we could start investing ourselves
[00:06:10] and build a clientele there, which was where I was really focused
[00:06:15] on when I was at the private equity fund.
[00:06:19] Wow.
[00:06:20] And were there lessons that you learned working in PE,
[00:06:24] private equity that you were able to bring
[00:06:25] into the individual sort of REALTOR practice?
[00:06:29] Absolutely.
[00:06:30] I think the big thing that I learned from private equity
[00:06:33] is whether you're buying one house or a thousand,
[00:06:36] it all comes down to the numbers,
[00:06:38] at least when you're looking at investment real estate,
[00:06:41] that when you're looking at a deal or looking at a market,
[00:06:45] it's all about understanding one of the risks
[00:06:49] that come with investing in that market
[00:06:50] and then also what your numbers look like.
[00:06:53] We're at the end of the day if it works on the spreadsheet
[00:06:56] and you've accounted for the risks,
[00:06:59] you have a much better chance of that property
[00:07:02] of being a good asset or a good buy
[00:07:05] and that translates to them working with individuals
[00:07:08] where it, again, doesn't matter if it's a big fund
[00:07:12] or someone looking to buy their first property,
[00:07:14] you can just get down to the numbers
[00:07:16] and the end of the day it is a big financial decision
[00:07:18] that they're making.
[00:07:20] Since I so rarely get to talk to anyone with your background,
[00:07:22] I just have a quick question and again,
[00:07:25] I know you're still newer to this industry
[00:07:27] but you have this unique perspective.
[00:07:29] Was it any surprise to you to see the Ibuyer start to,
[00:07:34] the Ibuyers start to fade away?
[00:07:36] You're talking about numbers, right?
[00:07:37] It's all about the numbers and we're seeing companies
[00:07:40] that really should have those numbers locked in pretty well
[00:07:43] and I'm not here to disparage companies like Zillow.
[00:07:45] I love Zillow, but even they got it wrong, right?
[00:07:49] So it's interesting.
[00:07:50] What do you think's going on on the Ibuyer side?
[00:07:53] Yeah, it's one of those things
[00:07:55] that the model that the Ibuyers use is so tough to do at scale.
[00:08:01] It was really the PE fund that I was at
[00:08:03] was trying to do one-to-four unit residential properties
[00:08:06] at scale and they were a small fund with a few hundred houses
[00:08:10] and I couldn't imagine a fund bigger than them
[00:08:15] doing what they're doing.
[00:08:16] You have to manage so many people and so many contractors
[00:08:18] and keep so many things straight
[00:08:20] that even if you have multiple levels of management,
[00:08:23] it's just tough to get that right.
[00:08:26] And especially when you're buying with such tight margins
[00:08:30] which is what we would see them doing.
[00:08:32] I know I brought a couple of properties to those Ibuyers
[00:08:35] didn't do a lot of work with them,
[00:08:37] but even the prices that they had to pay for the properties
[00:08:41] in order to win them and then try to sell them for higher.
[00:08:44] It's just a...
[00:08:45] Like were you able to look at those and say
[00:08:47] like they're overpaying, this is crazy?
[00:08:49] Oh yeah.
[00:08:50] Oh, I was like either they're much smarter than me
[00:08:54] because I have a lot of money on it.
[00:08:56] Or something is, something isn't adding up
[00:08:59] and I'm not gonna say I'm smart enough to go pay more
[00:09:01] than they are for this house.
[00:09:02] So I'm just gonna let it be.
[00:09:04] Well, turns out they were wrong.
[00:09:05] So...
[00:09:06] That's so good.
[00:09:07] 
[00:09:08] But so, but let's, so aren't,
[00:09:11] that's, and I'm sorry, I didn't mean to get us off track,
[00:09:13] but I figured I got Tony,
[00:09:15] he knows the private equity world.
[00:09:16] I was like, what's going on with all these Ibuyers?
[00:09:18] But let's get to the real meat of this
[00:09:21] because the really impressive thing you did
[00:09:23] in the first 18 months is close 40 million in production
[00:09:26] and that is, that puts you in the top one tenth
[00:09:29] of one percent of new REALTORS in the whole country.
[00:09:32] I mean, probably even more than the top 10,
[00:09:35] one tenth of one percent.
[00:09:36] So you were at this very elite level.
[00:09:40] I don't think success happens by accident.
[00:09:42] Maybe unless you had a friend who had a $40 million
[00:09:44] property, that would be sold.
[00:09:46] It was a one-trick, that's action.
[00:09:47] And I would say, even that I want to hear that story too,
[00:09:51] but I don't think that was what happened.
[00:09:52] So how did you do it?
[00:09:54] Every one of our listeners and viewers is like,
[00:09:56] they're dripping with jealousy just like I am.
[00:09:59] How did you do it?
[00:10:00] And what might you suggest to agents
[00:10:03] who want to duplicate that sort of success?
[00:10:06] Yeah, I mean, I think it was really a mix of a few things.
[00:10:09] And the first was, I did get very lucky
[00:10:14] with both the timing and the market that I was in.
[00:10:16] So there were some things that I did,
[00:10:18] and I'll talk about that, but starting with,
[00:10:20] getting into real estate right during the COVID boom,
[00:10:24] and then being in Nashville, Tennessee,
[00:10:25] which is one of the more talked about investment markets,
[00:10:29] definitely were some tailwinds that helped.
[00:10:32] So, but then within that, I know when I first got my license,
[00:10:36] I had a mentor who kind of told me, he said,
[00:10:39] hey, the first thing you need to do is find a niche.
[00:10:42] And for me, I'd kind of thought that investment
[00:10:45] real estate made sense, but also,
[00:10:47] was like, who's going to listen to a kid in their mid 20s,
[00:10:50] tell them about investment properties?
[00:10:51] So it was this kind of,
[00:10:52] apparently a lot of people.
[00:10:54] That's yeah.
[00:10:56] And so I really, that mentor was really pushing me on that.
[00:11:00] And I said, okay, I'm not going to do any marketing.
[00:11:03] The first time home buyers, I'm not going to do any marketing
[00:11:05] for luxury real estate.
[00:11:06] I'm just going to focus on this for six months,
[00:11:09] and we'll see how it goes.
[00:11:10] And it was definitely slow getting started
[00:11:14] those first few months.
[00:11:15] You just kind of bumble around and try things that don't work
[00:11:18] and try some things that work.
[00:11:20] And I think at least when I was first starting out,
[00:11:24] it was niching down and saying,
[00:11:26] I'm just going to focus on investors.
[00:11:27] And even within that saying,
[00:11:29] I'm looking for a very specific type of investor.
[00:11:32] And I think this can go for any real estate agent,
[00:11:35] who even if investors isn't your niche,
[00:11:37] but let's say it's first time home buyers.
[00:11:39] For me, I said, I'm looking for investors
[00:11:42] who need loans on the property,
[00:11:44] where they're not the flippers that are paying all cash
[00:11:46] and going to go flip 50 houses.
[00:11:48] I don't want to go write a bunch of offers for them
[00:11:50] and get rejected.
[00:11:51] I'm looking for an investor who has enough money
[00:11:54] for a down payment and is looking for a rental
[00:11:56] that's just going to give them monthly income.
[00:11:58] There's a lot more of those out there,
[00:12:01] and there's less, it's kind of this sweet spot
[00:12:03] where there haven't been as many REALTORS at least
[00:12:06] that I saw in Nashville who focused on that.
[00:12:08] And so once I identified that niche,
[00:12:12] then it was just asking the question,
[00:12:14] well, okay, where are they at?
[00:12:16] Where can I find them?
[00:12:18] And then it turned into a lot of just,
[00:12:21] let's go to real estate meetups
[00:12:23] and let's go bigger pockets was a big sort of.
[00:12:27] Let's go find those people, essentially.
[00:12:29] I'm going to pause you for a second
[00:12:30] because I want for anyone who is listening
[00:12:33] who is a little bit lost on like what Tony's talking about.
[00:12:36] So his niche was he wants to work with investors.
[00:12:40] He wants buy and hold investors who need loans.
[00:12:43] So we've now identified his niche.
[00:12:45] Now you might be thinking,
[00:12:46] well, where does Tony find these people
[00:12:48] who, and there are places to find it,
[00:12:52] but my question is actually going to be a different question,
[00:12:54] Tony, is it, it's been my experience
[00:12:58] talking to other investors and people in this industry
[00:13:01] who do what you do, that finding the investors
[00:13:04] is actually the easy part.
[00:13:05] My suspicion is finding the deal is step number one.
[00:13:08] In other words, finding those opportunities
[00:13:10] to then present to a versus, now traditional primary residence
[00:13:17] home buyers, they can look on Zellow,
[00:13:20] they can look on Redfin.
[00:13:20] Agent isn't always the one that finds the property.
[00:13:24] You know, the buyer is usually finding the property
[00:13:27] and bringing it to the REALTOR.
[00:13:28] I want to go see that place.
[00:13:29] Now, for on the investor side,
[00:13:31] I'm guessing it's you finding the deal
[00:13:32] and then you saying, here's a cash flow opportunity
[00:13:35] and then going to your pool of investors,
[00:13:37] by the way, for anyone who isn't familiar with bigger pockets,
[00:13:40] it is the largest online forum for real estate investors
[00:13:43] in the country, it is by far the top of the mountain.
[00:13:47] If you ever really want to get a good education
[00:13:49] and understand how investors think and talk to each other,
[00:13:53] it's basically like Reddit for investors.
[00:13:56] That's what it is.
[00:13:57] It's where you can, it's a social component.
[00:14:00] I've had the bigger pockets guys on my show
[00:14:01] before I love those guys, they're just awesome.
[00:14:04] And it is a great place to learn how to talk to investors.
[00:14:09] But anyway, was I right about that
[00:14:10] that finding the opportunity is really the hard part
[00:14:13] and finding the money and then investors is the easy part?
[00:14:16] Absolutely.
[00:14:17] I think that's the first step being finding the investors
[00:14:21] as far as, you know, if you find a great deal,
[00:14:23] but nobody can buy it, then you're kind of out of luck.
[00:14:26] But that's definitely the easy part.
[00:14:28] And I think then going and finding the deal comes down to even,
[00:14:34] first I think understanding who you're working with
[00:14:37] on the investor side and what they're looking for.
[00:14:39] That was something that I learned from the private equity fund
[00:14:41] that I took into real estate was,
[00:14:44] let me sit down with this investor
[00:14:45] and work through exactly what they're looking for in a property.
[00:14:49] And without getting too technical on the investment side,
[00:14:51] basically saying, you know, here is either the return
[00:14:55] that you're looking for or what kind of neighborhood
[00:14:56] are you looking for as far as how quickly it's growing
[00:15:00] versus how stable or, you know, what not,
[00:15:02] let's sit down and figure out what you're looking for
[00:15:04] and then go find properties that fit that box.
[00:15:08] It's the same thing when I work with,
[00:15:10] because I will take clients on who are looking to buy
[00:15:13] their first home or friends and family.
[00:15:14] And it's the same thing as, you know,
[00:15:16] I could love a house that we go see,
[00:15:18] but if it's not the kind of house that they're looking for,
[00:15:21] I just wasted both of our time.
[00:15:23] And so to really get narrowed down in their criteria,
[00:15:27] that then gives me a better feel for going out
[00:15:32] and finding those properties so that when I present it to them,
[00:15:35] I want to know how to present it and say,
[00:15:37] look, this is what fits your goals.
[00:15:38] And also I can kind of weed out a lot of the properties
[00:15:42] that don't.
[00:15:42] So kind of winds up being an easier way to search.
[00:15:47] So basically you meet with an investor, you say,
[00:15:49] okay, what are you looking for?
[00:15:51] In other words, is there an annualized rate of return
[00:15:53] that you'd like to have?
[00:15:55] Is the K1 for tax deduction the most important thing?
[00:16:00] Is it the income?
[00:16:01] Is it the appreciation?
[00:16:03] So Tony walks his, or doesn't walk people through,
[00:16:06] he finds out exactly what his investors want and need.
[00:16:09] And then he says, okay, I get it.
[00:16:12] I know what you want.
[00:16:13] Now my job is to go find these properties.
[00:16:15] So here's question number two.
[00:16:16] So now you've identified the needs of the client.
[00:16:20] And now it's, okay, now you've got to find the hard part,
[00:16:22] the property.
[00:16:23] Where are you finding the properties?
[00:16:25] What percentage of the time are the properties on the MLS?
[00:16:28] And what percentage of the time are you doing creative ways
[00:16:31] to find things that are not available on the MLS?
[00:16:34] Yeah, I would say it shifted, even within the past couple
[00:16:38] of years, it's definitely shifted.
[00:16:39] Where early on it was more off market,
[00:16:42] I would go just try to network with people.
[00:16:46] So I'd go to not necessarily real estate agent events,
[00:16:49] but real estate investor events or business networking groups
[00:16:52] and just ask everyone I knew I'd say,
[00:16:55] hey, I've got somebody who's looking for X, Y, Z type property.
[00:16:59] Do you know of anybody?
[00:17:00] And then I'd put them into my follow-up system
[00:17:03] and just follow up with them saying,
[00:17:04] I've got a buyer looking for this.
[00:17:06] Do you have anything?
[00:17:07] And same thing with wholesalers.
[00:17:09] I would go find wholesalers or investors and say,
[00:17:12] do you have anything coming up?
[00:17:13] Keep me on your list.
[00:17:14] And it was really just finding the people
[00:17:18] who were out there hunting for deals daily
[00:17:21] and then keeping in touch with them.
[00:17:23] And that I think was key for finding those properties.
[00:17:26] So you weren't sending all these mailers
[00:17:29] to these multi-family buildings or whatever, saying,
[00:17:33] hey, I want to buy your property,
[00:17:34] which some people do and have success with that.
[00:17:36] You can go knock on doors.
[00:17:38] You either are ways to find properties
[00:17:40] that aren't even, aren't listed at all.
[00:17:43] But that are, you know, mom and pop may,
[00:17:46] you know, owns a multi-family.
[00:17:49] And there's a million different ways
[00:17:51] and there are much, much better podcasts than this,
[00:17:56] specifically for how to creatively find those properties.
[00:17:59] We're not real estate investing podcasts per se,
[00:18:01] but I was curious.
[00:18:03] But you do sometimes find them on the MLS as well, I'm guessing.
[00:18:06] Yeah, absolutely.
[00:18:07] And it was probably, I'd say close to 50-50,
[00:18:10] where the MLS was a lot more of what you were talking about
[00:18:13] if they were looking for just a property to park money in
[00:18:16] or some, you know, a few new builds
[00:18:18] that were going to be nice corporate rentals.
[00:18:20] Or, you know, you find properties on the MLS,
[00:18:23] but I'd always just tell my clients, I'd say,
[00:18:25] hey, I'll set you up.
[00:18:27] I said, I have a three-step process
[00:18:28] where I will set you up on the auto search for properties.
[00:18:32] And this, I think, works with any client
[00:18:33] where I'd say, I'll set you up on the auto search.
[00:18:35] So if I'm away from my office or whatever reason,
[00:18:38] you get the properties and you don't have to rely on me
[00:18:41] seeing them.
[00:18:42] I'll also see see myself on the auto search
[00:18:45] and that step too.
[00:18:46] And I go through that once a day.
[00:18:47] So if there's something that really jumps out to me,
[00:18:49] then I'll reach out to you directly as well.
[00:18:52] So it can be, there's two-way conversation,
[00:18:54] you know, that I'm actively looking for you.
[00:18:57] And then three is the off-market properties.
[00:18:59] And that's, you know, I'll really be personally
[00:19:02] reaching out to you on those.
[00:19:04] But I think that helped me win a lot of clients initially
[00:19:07] where they said, oh, he's going to do more than just set me up
[00:19:10] on an auto search and wait for me to respond
[00:19:12] and just kind of earn some trust early on.
[00:19:14] And how important is it to be active
[00:19:18] in these online forums like bigger pockets
[00:19:21] so that you can get access to this huge network of people
[00:19:25] who want to invest and also learn?
[00:19:28] I mean, I tell everyone if you want the best education
[00:19:31] about how to add the service of being able to support clients
[00:19:35] who want real estate investment advice
[00:19:37] and what those kind of deals, bigger pockets is,
[00:19:40] I can't think of a better place to go than that.
[00:19:43] But how important is that for the education
[00:19:46] and also the networking?
[00:19:47] Oh, absolutely.
[00:19:49] I think it's big.
[00:19:50] If people, it's just reaching out and letting people know
[00:19:54] that you're there to add value,
[00:19:55] I think that's the big thing is if you're there to learn
[00:19:57] and to add value, that networking is big
[00:20:01] because everybody can kind of see through
[00:20:03] if you show up with the business card
[00:20:04] to the networking events, hey, call me
[00:20:06] if you're gonna buy cell property
[00:20:07] and they'll add your card to the list of 20 other people.
[00:20:10] But if you're there and you're either very interested
[00:20:14] in learning about their experience
[00:20:16] and that's where I see real estate agents and lenders
[00:20:19] and people who do that really well,
[00:20:21] they're there to learn and then they're there to add value
[00:20:23] of even if it's just one tidbit.
[00:20:26] I learned this from one of my mentors, he's like,
[00:20:28] hey, find one thing about your market
[00:20:30] that most real estate agents don't know.
[00:20:32] And you can just throw that into your first conversation.
[00:20:35] Nashville, it was within the Nashville Metro,
[00:20:38] there were two different tax districts
[00:20:40] and one, you paid about half the property taxes
[00:20:42] you did the other.
[00:20:43] And I would just throw that into my first conversation
[00:20:45] where I would like to know that
[00:20:47] if I was moving to Nashville, yeah.
[00:20:49] Absolutely.
[00:20:50] And I'd say, hey, here's, you know, it's the briley loop,
[00:20:53] the freeway if you essentially if you're inside that,
[00:20:55] your property taxes are gonna be almost twice
[00:20:57] what they will if you're outside.
[00:20:59] And all of a sudden you've added value and built trust,
[00:21:02] but you can only do that if you get in front of people
[00:21:05] either networking online or in person.
[00:21:08] And so I think that's huge.
[00:21:09] I think that's a big, big value add.
[00:21:11] Yeah, I, what, A-Again, you've really only been practicing
[00:21:15] as a REALTOR for a short amount of time.
[00:21:17] What percentage of agents do you think
[00:21:19] have your particular skill set
[00:21:22] with respect to real estate investment?
[00:21:26] Like I'm just gonna throw a number
[00:21:28] I'm completely making out of whole cloth.
[00:21:30] I'm gonna say less than 3% of REALTOR
[00:21:33] is probably focus in the market that you're in
[00:21:35] or focus in real estate investing.
[00:21:38] Would that be a roughly fair?
[00:21:42] Yeah, it's, that's a question that honestly,
[00:21:44] I haven't been around enough or in enough markets
[00:21:48] to see in Nashville.
[00:21:49] I will say so now being in Nashville
[00:21:51] and in California, that percentage was much higher
[00:21:54] in Nashville, I think just because there's so much.
[00:21:57] Because Nashville was exploding there.
[00:21:59] That's, yeah, but it was, it's still low.
[00:22:01] I mean, it's still, I think that three to five percent there
[00:22:04] and then probably, you know, one percent or less
[00:22:07] that really focus on real estate in California
[00:22:09] or on investing where I am in California.
[00:22:13] It's such a nice additional avenue to add.
[00:22:17] So, you know, and again, you can't be all things to all people.
[00:22:19] You're like, hey, I'm not a luxury guy.
[00:22:21] I'm not a first time home buyer guy.
[00:22:23] I mean, you could be and you could,
[00:22:24] you could get your way through those deals, obviously.
[00:22:27] But it's not your main focus, but it's a nice thing.
[00:22:31] You know, if it was me and I, I guess it's all
[00:22:34] about what you're into.
[00:22:35] Like you came from that world, you came from the PE world.
[00:22:38] It's what you're into, you're a numbers guy,
[00:22:41] you're a systems guy and let's actually,
[00:22:43] let's switch to systems because that is, you know,
[00:22:47] anyone can grind out, not anyone.
[00:22:49] But a lot of times people think, well,
[00:22:51] Tony did 40 million in 18 months and his first 18 months,
[00:22:54] he must have just grinded it out and you probably did.
[00:22:57] But I'm curious to know what systems helped make them
[00:23:00] a little bit easier for you because I imagine
[00:23:03] you were working pretty long hours to get to those numbers.
[00:23:06] Yeah, it was really definitely trying to figure out
[00:23:11] how to take what I was doing.
[00:23:14] My motto as far as growing and scaling is I say,
[00:23:18] okay, let's work really hard.
[00:23:20] And then let's figure out how to simplify what I'm doing
[00:23:22] so that I can scale bigger.
[00:23:23] And then work really hard, simplify scale.
[00:23:26] Like that's kind of how I think about it.
[00:23:28] And so the first few months that I was in the business,
[00:23:31] it was let's just call everyone I can on my cell phone
[00:23:34] or go through Facebook or you know,
[00:23:36] keep a Google sheet and then realize
[00:23:37] that's not sustainable for anything.
[00:23:40] And so then started using a CRM and really keeping track
[00:23:45] of my contacts and trying to set tasks for myself
[00:23:49] to follow up with people and trying to, you know,
[00:23:52] still make it personal because we've all seen the automated
[00:23:55] emails where you know that you're on a mailing list
[00:23:57] and it sounds like a mailing list and you burn trust that way.
[00:24:01] So I said, well, I don't want to do that.
[00:24:03] But let's figure out how to keep in touch with my clients
[00:24:07] and really just organize my database
[00:24:09] because like you were talking about with, oh, go ahead.
[00:24:13] No, I didn't mean to interrupt your flow.
[00:24:15] I'm super excited to hear about how systems you built to do this.
[00:24:19] Yeah.
[00:24:19] Yeah, so it was really, the first one was my database
[00:24:23] and at first I used the CRM that was provided
[00:24:26] from my brokerage and then tried a couple others
[00:24:29] but it was really more the functions of,
[00:24:32] I would, anybody who went into my database
[00:24:33] or anyone I've met went into my database.
[00:24:36] I'll start there and then I tagged them as whether they were,
[00:24:41] you know, buyer, seller, vendor, friend, whoever
[00:24:45] and then they'd get added to a couple of things
[00:24:48] where one, I just had a newsletter that I pushed out
[00:24:51] and it wasn't anything groundbreaking.
[00:24:52] I didn't spend a lot of time on it
[00:24:54] but it was just, hey, you know, I'm in the market.
[00:24:56] Here's a little tidbit to add value.
[00:24:58] And then from there, I always knew, you know,
[00:25:02] one, I would be able to fish kind of with that newsletter
[00:25:05] and then anyone who was active, I really kept track
[00:25:08] of where they were in the process
[00:25:10] and what they were expecting from me
[00:25:13] if I had active clients, I would know that hand,
[00:25:15] I'd call them every couple days or every day or, you know,
[00:25:19] whatnot and then anybody who was still a new lead,
[00:25:23] I'd push them through.
[00:25:25] I did have a few automated campaigns and templates
[00:25:27] and things I'd use for new leads.
[00:25:29] And it was really, I would just develop those based off
[00:25:33] of if I did something once I'd say,
[00:25:35] let's figure out a way to simplify this the next time.
[00:25:38] So let's put automation or a task in
[00:25:39] and then let's figure out how to do 100 times more work
[00:25:43] with that same system without it breaking.
[00:25:45] So you'd meet with a client and you'd get a sense
[00:25:48] of what their expectations are of you
[00:25:51] and you would identify those and probably arrive
[00:25:54] at some sort of agreements, like whether it's verbal
[00:25:58] or just in terms of you're like, okay,
[00:26:00] I know what I need to do for this client,
[00:26:01] which means I'm going to call them either every day,
[00:26:05] every other day, every three days.
[00:26:06] You made that determination, of course,
[00:26:09] every client can be different.
[00:26:10] And you make that determination
[00:26:11] and then you set up the repeating tasks
[00:26:13] so that you don't forget.
[00:26:15] And again, this sounds so basic.
[00:26:18] However, the basics are, the fundamentals
[00:26:21] are usually when the game.
[00:26:22] And so as silly as it is to go,
[00:26:24] remember every three days in your calendar,
[00:26:26] you have to call so and so.
[00:26:28] It's funny, I told this story before
[00:26:29] and I apologize for our audience that has heard it,
[00:26:32] ad nauseam, but I talked to one of the top agents
[00:26:35] in Chicago here many years ago.
[00:26:37] And I said, what do you think?
[00:26:38] It's literally out of 46,000 agents,
[00:26:40] she's number one.
[00:26:41] And I was like, how did you,
[00:26:43] what, what, what, why are you number one?
[00:26:44] And, you know, what did you do different?
[00:26:46] She goes, DJ, I call every one of my clients every week.
[00:26:49] And I go, and she's like,
[00:26:51] well, the active clients, right?
[00:26:53] And she goes, yeah, active clients.
[00:26:55] And I said, and like, yeah, so, you know, not so,
[00:26:59] but kind of I was expecting a bigger.
[00:27:01] And she goes, well, obviously there's a million
[00:27:03] other things she does, but she goes,
[00:27:05] that's my secret sauce.
[00:27:06] And I was like, it's, it's that.
[00:27:08] And she goes, I know it sounds really silly, right?
[00:27:10] And she goes, that's it.
[00:27:12] She goes, you'd be shocked.
[00:27:14] Most agents don't.
[00:27:15] They're afraid to call their clients unless it's good news.
[00:27:18] So, so curious to get your thoughts like,
[00:27:21] when you know you have to call them
[00:27:22] every couple of days, do you already know?
[00:27:25] I mean, unless it's like new news
[00:27:26] that you don't prevent them, do you know sort of what
[00:27:28] you're gonna say?
[00:27:29] Yeah, typically it'll be, and whether it's a,
[00:27:33] you know, I say call, sometimes it would be a text.
[00:27:36] I'd use the word communicate of, you know,
[00:27:39] get in touch with them to stay top of mind.
[00:27:42] And yeah, when there was no news,
[00:27:43] it would really just be a quick,
[00:27:45] usually just a quick text of saying,
[00:27:46] hey, just wanted to check in with you
[00:27:48] nothing new on the market today or nothing new I've seen,
[00:27:51] but wanted to let you know I'm looking.
[00:27:54] And that was, that was it.
[00:27:55] They know that I'm looking for them,
[00:27:57] but there was nothing there.
[00:27:58] Not, I dropped off the face of the earth
[00:28:00] because they have it heard from me in two days
[00:28:01] and they're checking Zillow for three hours a day
[00:28:04] and feeling like their agent isn't,
[00:28:07] they're with them.
[00:28:08] Yeah, the number one reason people fire their agent
[00:28:11] is shocking, not shockingly communication.
[00:28:14] It's consistency communication.
[00:28:17] So, okay, so you now have these systems in place
[00:28:20] or with respect to communication.
[00:28:23] What other, tell me about how you began to develop your systems
[00:28:26] so that because again, that isn't necessarily
[00:28:30] super easy to scale, right?
[00:28:31] Because you have a certain amount of clients,
[00:28:33] you've certain number of phone calls or texts
[00:28:35] or emails you can make in a day.
[00:28:36] So, how do you sort of keep it all organized?
[00:28:40] Yeah, so what I started to do with the systems is,
[00:28:44] as I kept scaling, I said, okay,
[00:28:47] I need to push a system until it breaks
[00:28:49] where like you said the tasks.
[00:28:51] I let me just call everyone until I can't call everyone anymore
[00:28:53] and then let's step it up.
[00:28:56] And so, within my niche, what I wound up doing
[00:28:59] is I started tracking where I would lose clients.
[00:29:02] And I started to see like, okay,
[00:29:06] I'm getting X amount of leads in from,
[00:29:08] and you've mentioned bigger pockets.
[00:29:10] I've bought bigger pockets leads for a long time.
[00:29:12] And they were a rate lead source where they would come in
[00:29:15] and I had an automated workload come into my CRM.
[00:29:20] I'd hit them with an intro email that had a video in it
[00:29:23] saying here's a little bit about the market.
[00:29:25] I'd love to book a call with you.
[00:29:26] Here's my calendar invite.
[00:29:27] And then I just had a automated email in text
[00:29:30] that would go out every day to them
[00:29:32] just until they booked a meeting.
[00:29:34] And so that, you know, as one example,
[00:29:37] I realized that came out of me realizing
[00:29:40] that I was losing a lot of leads that came in
[00:29:43] because I even though I felt like I was reaching out to them
[00:29:46] quickly within, you know, 15, 30 minutes,
[00:29:48] it wasn't instantaneous and somebody else was.
[00:29:51] And isn't that amazing?
[00:29:53] 
[00:29:53] That's like 15 to 30 minutes.
[00:29:55] It's almost like it happened to Centro and Go.
[00:29:57] Yeah.
[00:29:58] That's yeah, because by that point,
[00:30:00] they're done looking at properties
[00:30:01] and they're moving on to their next thing.
[00:30:03] And if somebody calls them right when they're looking,
[00:30:05] it's, you know, when I, if I need my lawn mode
[00:30:07] and I go call one lawn care company
[00:30:11] and they don't pick up, I'm just going to move on
[00:30:13] and call the next one.
[00:30:14] And it's, it's ridiculous when you're looking at it
[00:30:16] from the other side of things
[00:30:17] if we have such short attention spans,
[00:30:19] but it's such a big thing.
[00:30:21] So, but yeah, I would track really that being one example.
[00:30:25] I would track where I was losing leads
[00:30:27] and then try to figure out a way to plug that hole
[00:30:30] on if it was, okay, new leads are coming in
[00:30:32] and I'm converting them at, you know, 20%
[00:30:36] and I should be at 30 or I think I can get to 30.
[00:30:39] Let me go analyze that part of my business
[00:30:41] and make it better.
[00:30:42] And this is where I, I'm just a data numbers nerd
[00:30:45] on the side of things.
[00:30:46] And so I'd look at that or then I'd look at my pipeline
[00:30:49] and say, okay, I, you know, I'm getting a lot of good clients
[00:30:53] in, but then I'm not, you know, I'm losing them
[00:30:56] once they become clients
[00:30:57] and I should be converting higher here.
[00:30:59] Okay, that's because I'm not finding good deals for them.
[00:31:02] Let me go find more ways to find them properties
[00:31:05] or under contract.
[00:31:06] Am I not doing a good job of communicating with lenders
[00:31:09] or inspectors or getting bids from contractors?
[00:31:13] You know, there's, there's different factors
[00:31:14] at each stage of the client journey
[00:31:17] or after they bought a property,
[00:31:19] how much repeat business am I getting
[00:31:22] and if it's low, how can I follow up with them better?
[00:31:24] So there's these, I kind of developed five different stages
[00:31:27] where I could be losing clients
[00:31:29] and then I just try to optimize each one of those
[00:31:32] and make those better.
[00:31:33] So it's all basic stuff,
[00:31:35] but it's just putting a framework in to think through it.
[00:31:38] Well, pushups are basic too
[00:31:40] and they're also super annoying, right?
[00:31:42] So, so, I mean, I mean, that with the highest possible
[00:31:46] compliment because it's always these fundamentals
[00:31:49] and just as you were telling me, you know,
[00:31:51] I'm thinking about I'm a recruiter, basically recruit REALTORS.
[00:31:55] So I could, I was trying to apply this to my own systems
[00:31:58] of like, where do I lose recruits?
[00:32:00] Like, why do they end up choosing other firms
[00:32:02] and where in my process?
[00:32:04] But because I think that comes from that private equity
[00:32:07] large scale size, even though you weren't able
[00:32:10] to smaller firm or you had a smaller fund,
[00:32:12] you still were managing hundreds of houses
[00:32:14] and so this idea of scalability is obviously important.
[00:32:18] So you have to look for those weak points
[00:32:20] and this idea of doing an audit in your communication chain
[00:32:24] in your, you know, or just in your sales pipeline
[00:32:28] and looking at your five stages,
[00:32:29] identifying those weak points and plugging those holes
[00:32:32] as you said, boy, I'm loving that.
[00:32:36] And you're a numbers guy.
[00:32:38] So you're a metrics person.
[00:32:40] So everything is benchmarked and metriced
[00:32:43] and we know for above the line or below the line
[00:32:45] and for below.
[00:32:46] And what's really cool about real estate stuff
[00:32:48] is there's a lot of data out there
[00:32:50] that you can use to say what is the, you know,
[00:32:53] on a bigger pockets lead or a Zilla lead
[00:32:55] or whatever it might be.
[00:32:56] You know, the average close rate is this.
[00:32:57] I want to get to X.
[00:32:58] So a lot of this data is already there
[00:33:01] for you to benchmark against
[00:33:03] and it just helps you become super efficient, I imagine.
[00:33:06] Mm hmm.
[00:33:07] Absolutely.
[00:33:08] It's, and I think it's something that,
[00:33:11] not everybody in real estate,
[00:33:13] but I feel like most of us are pretty competitive too.
[00:33:15] And so if you can use data to say,
[00:33:17] oh, here's where the averages are,
[00:33:19] here's where the top tier are.
[00:33:22] I'm sitting, you know, below that,
[00:33:24] oh, what's it going to take for me to get there
[00:33:25] for me to get to the next level?
[00:33:26] And I think it's a good mesh of being able
[00:33:29] to use those data points to push yourself to be better.
[00:33:34] Yeah, I mean, even,
[00:33:35] I would even encourage all of our listeners or viewers,
[00:33:37] if there's someone in your local market
[00:33:39] who's a REALTOR that you admire
[00:33:41] that has like a very, you know,
[00:33:43] some really impressive numbers,
[00:33:44] whether it's production, whether it's a days on market,
[00:33:47] whether it's, you know, percentage or list price,
[00:33:50] whatever the metric is that you're like,
[00:33:52] how do they do that?
[00:33:53] Literally call them and be like,
[00:33:54] I am so enamored with the way that you do X, Y, or Z.
[00:33:58] I'm your biggest fan.
[00:33:59] I noticed you do all these things.
[00:34:01] Could I grab 15 minutes of your day?
[00:34:04] I'll buy you coffee or lunch or whatever.
[00:34:06] I promise you that will be in call five of those people.
[00:34:10] One of those people, if not all five,
[00:34:12] will take that 15 minutes and have you ever done that?
[00:34:16] Where are you reaching out to other mentor?
[00:34:18] Are you said you have mentors?
[00:34:20] Yeah, absolutely.
[00:34:21] I think that's something that either both
[00:34:24] within my market and Nashville,
[00:34:26] I did that a few times and then even outside of the market,
[00:34:28] I'd find somebody who was out in Ohio or Pennsylvania
[00:34:32] where they're just crushing it in their market,
[00:34:35] but I'd say, hey, you know, one big fan would love to,
[00:34:39] even an investment real estate, it was the,
[00:34:42] hey, I can add value, I would love to push people your way
[00:34:45] if they're not a fit for Nashville.
[00:34:47] Like the numbers look good in your market or whatever,
[00:34:49] you know, would love to pick your brain for 15 minutes
[00:34:52] or, you know, usually instead of pick your brain,
[00:34:54] I don't like that saying as much.
[00:34:56] Yeah, so who cares now?
[00:34:57] Just, hey, I've got these three questions
[00:34:59] or here's the one thing I'm struggling with.
[00:35:01] Would you mind sharing what you do here
[00:35:03] because I see you doing it really well?
[00:35:06] And that's an easy answer for them.
[00:35:08] They don't have to think through,
[00:35:09] oh, what's he gonna ask?
[00:35:11] It's no, here's the question.
[00:35:12] Here's where they can add value and they're happy
[00:35:15] to get it.
[00:35:16] And it's super flattering to ask someone for their advice.
[00:35:19] It is what, we think maybe I will be annoying
[00:35:23] those people will be bothering them, maybe well,
[00:35:25] but good chance you won't be
[00:35:27] because they're gonna be so flattered
[00:35:29] that you've recognized something in their process
[00:35:33] that probably most people don't recognize.
[00:35:35] They just see them as successful or,
[00:35:37] and you're like, hey, I noticed you do this one thing.
[00:35:40] I'm, like you said, I'm such a fan of that.
[00:35:42] I would love to learn how you do that.
[00:35:44] And maybe I can add value to you and help you and et cetera.
[00:35:48] It's all about those connections
[00:35:50] and those, you almost have to be a fan of other agents.
[00:35:54] I think, I have learned that after almost 500 episodes,
[00:35:58] the top agents that I've had on this show,
[00:36:00] they're always like so happy to get,
[00:36:04] they get excited about other agents.
[00:36:06] Because they're like, oh, there's this other guy
[00:36:08] that does this really cool thing.
[00:36:10] And so I think that's part of it too.
[00:36:12] But knowing your numbers, right?
[00:36:14] We'll go back to systems.
[00:36:16] You gotta know your numbers.
[00:36:17] You gotta spend the time every single day
[00:36:20] studying your local market, studying your niche.
[00:36:23] You gotta know the numbers.
[00:36:25] And most agents, the good news is,
[00:36:26] most agents really don't know their numbers
[00:36:28] for being honest.
[00:36:30] So for the people that do spend that time
[00:36:32] and really niche down and figure out where they,
[00:36:35] they blossom and bloom.
[00:36:38] And it's just, it's so impressive
[00:36:39] because most agents aren't gonna spend that time doing it.
[00:36:43] Yeah, yeah, absolutely.
[00:36:45] And so I think if that's you,
[00:36:47] and either if your number's driven,
[00:36:48] or even if you're not,
[00:36:49] but you're able to take a little bit of time
[00:36:51] and run through it,
[00:36:52] you have such a leg up on the competition.
[00:36:55] Or you'll at least,
[00:36:56] and I'd love to hear your take on this too.
[00:36:58] I think that's how you can build a sustainable business.
[00:37:01] You're never chasing the next client then.
[00:37:03] You say, here's my marketing budget for this month,
[00:37:06] or here's how many people I need to call.
[00:37:09] Or if I do this, then this will happen within reason.
[00:37:12] Markets can change and shift,
[00:37:14] but you're never,
[00:37:16] I would think you'll be less stressed
[00:37:19] on when's the next deal coming in,
[00:37:21] because you're focused on those things
[00:37:23] that you can control to make that next deal happen.
[00:37:25] Totally.
[00:37:26] And all that we can ever really control
[00:37:28] is our thoughts and actions, right?
[00:37:30] So it's like,
[00:37:31] yeah.
[00:37:32] That's all we can control.
[00:37:33] And the good news is we can control it mostly.
[00:37:37] But I wanna talk about Realty Flow.
[00:37:40] This is your CRM because you're a systems guy,
[00:37:42] and you were looking for a CRM solution
[00:37:44] for your particular niche,
[00:37:46] and you were like,
[00:37:47] you couldn't really find one that was a perfect fit.
[00:37:50] You're like, I'm gonna build one.
[00:37:52] So, and by the way,
[00:37:53] many people have attempted this.
[00:37:55] This is not,
[00:37:56] this is a tough, tough business,
[00:37:59] but I wanna,
[00:38:01] if I was gonna,
[00:38:03] you know,
[00:38:03] I would be looking at a CRM from a guy who did 40 billion
[00:38:06] in his first 18 months,
[00:38:07] that seems like a guy I'd wanna follow.
[00:38:09] So tell us about Realty Flow
[00:38:12] and what you're looking to do with that.
[00:38:15] Yeah, it really,
[00:38:16] so Realty Flow came out of the,
[00:38:19] essentially came out of the consulting firm
[00:38:21] that I've been running for the last few months on,
[00:38:24] basically I've been going in,
[00:38:25] and exactly what we just talked through
[00:38:28] with other real estate agents saying,
[00:38:29] hey, I'll come in,
[00:38:30] I'll help you audit your numbers,
[00:38:32] I'll help you look at,
[00:38:33] you know,
[00:38:33] what systems you're using
[00:38:34] and let's figure out ways to streamline your business
[00:38:37] and kind of come in and do that.
[00:38:38] I went through that a few times with agents
[00:38:41] and realized that there were some similarities
[00:38:43] between really agents at different productivity levels
[00:38:48] of, you know, the top, top tier agents,
[00:38:50] usually have their systems pretty dialed,
[00:38:52] a lot of newer agents.
[00:38:54] It, their systems were like giving a Ferrari to a 15 year old,
[00:38:58] who hasn't learned how to drive yet.
[00:38:59] On, you know,
[00:39:00] you get these big CRMs that can do a million different things,
[00:39:03] but really you just need a way to manage your contacts,
[00:39:06] track deals,
[00:39:08] manage tasks,
[00:39:09] which that was the one weird one that I just,
[00:39:12] most CRMs don't have just like a Google tasks kind of thing,
[00:39:15] where you can just put sticky notes in,
[00:39:17] it all has to be assigned to contacts and whatever,
[00:39:20] and then just do, you know,
[00:39:22] basic automated texting and emailing
[00:39:25] and then tracking those things.
[00:39:26] And so from that,
[00:39:28] I was able to link up with a couple of business partners
[00:39:31] that I worked with one before
[00:39:33] and one is a developer,
[00:39:36] software developer,
[00:39:37] and then other lens,
[00:39:37] and they just finished another project,
[00:39:39] and they were like,
[00:39:39] hey, Tony, you know what,
[00:39:40] what are you working on?
[00:39:42] And it just kind of mashed where we decided
[00:39:45] we were gonna launch a real estate CRM,
[00:39:47] really with the same model or mantra
[00:39:50] that I've been using for my business on just,
[00:39:53] this is designed to simplify your business
[00:39:55] so that you can scale.
[00:39:57] And so that you can then go work hard on your business
[00:39:59] and then simplify it through the system and then scale.
[00:40:02] And so it's really,
[00:40:03] it's not meant to be anything groundbreaking
[00:40:05] other than just here as a clean, simple way
[00:40:09] to look at everything in your business
[00:40:11] instead of a convoluted dashboard
[00:40:13] with a thousand different things going on
[00:40:15] that you have to sift through.
[00:40:17] So.
[00:40:17] I think what a lot of times CRMs are,
[00:40:21] you know, they're built by developers
[00:40:23] and developers aren't necessarily real estate agents.
[00:40:26] Sometimes they are, sometimes they're not, mostly they're not.
[00:40:29] And so I think sometimes CRM companies, tech companies,
[00:40:33] get some of the tools a little bit wrong
[00:40:36] only in the sense of understanding that providing,
[00:40:40] you know, all of these different features, functionality is great.
[00:40:44] But what it can result in for especially a newer agent
[00:40:48] is a lot of anxiety.
[00:40:49] So they get this, like you said, they get, you know,
[00:40:51] their CRM, which is fully featured,
[00:40:53] has all these amazing tools.
[00:40:55] And yet it becomes overwhelming
[00:40:57] because there's so much, it's basically a blank canvas
[00:41:00] with all these different, you know,
[00:41:02] all this different paint, all, you know,
[00:41:04] a million paint colors.
[00:41:06] And it's like, ooh, what do I do?
[00:41:08] So you're looking to sort of simplify the process,
[00:41:11] streamline it, make it really accessible to agents
[00:41:15] so that they can plug in and scale up.
[00:41:18] Exactly.
[00:41:19] And I think just designing it,
[00:41:20] you hit it right on the head,
[00:41:21] designing something that's four real estate agents
[00:41:23] because a lot of these big companies,
[00:41:25] it's a CRM that works really well for an enterprise,
[00:41:29] Fortune 500 company with five levels of management.
[00:41:32] Sure.
[00:41:32] It needs to do a lot more than a real estate agent
[00:41:35] or even a brokerage or a team
[00:41:37] where you're tracking very specific things.
[00:41:39] And it's really just saying,
[00:41:41] let's remove all the stuff that would work well
[00:41:43] for other industries,
[00:41:44] but that you don't need in real estate
[00:41:46] and then do the things that you need in real estate,
[00:41:48] really, really well.
[00:41:50] And then let's bring in some fun stuff,
[00:41:52] like we pulled in chat GPT
[00:41:54] so you can write listing descriptions
[00:41:55] and some other things.
[00:41:56] We just pulled that in so that you can do all of that
[00:42:00] from the CRM.
[00:42:01] But it's really like,
[00:42:02] let's do the essentials really, really well
[00:42:04] and get rid of them.
[00:42:06] Yeah, the fundamentals.
[00:42:08] Let's keep the machine oiled and running.
[00:42:11] I love it.
[00:42:12] So I would encourage everyone to check out
[00:42:14] realtiflo.io, check out,
[00:42:17] you can do demos there,
[00:42:19] you can see the CRM in inaction
[00:42:21] and hopefully maybe become a client.
[00:42:25] So check out realtiflo.io.
[00:42:28] Also, I want everybody to follow Tony
[00:42:30] at on Instagram,
[00:42:32] TonyClark.realestate.
[00:42:34] We have links to both of those in our show notes.
[00:42:38] Tony, one last question.
[00:42:40] Now, you've had a tremendous amount of success
[00:42:42] in the last 18 months,
[00:42:43] which again, it's like blowing me away,
[00:42:47] you're a success.
[00:42:48] And by the way, hugely jealous of you.
[00:42:51] So amazing, amazing success there.
[00:42:56] Jealousy in the most positive way.
[00:42:59] What were Miss,
[00:43:00] give us one mistake that you made
[00:43:03] or something that you're struggling with right now
[00:43:05] just so that we know you're human.
[00:43:07] We know that you have your own struggles.
[00:43:10] Oh, how much time do we have on the list?
[00:43:14] Yeah, I think the,
[00:43:18] if I were to think back kind of the number one mistake
[00:43:21] that I make over and over is I try to do too much
[00:43:25] instead of leveraging,
[00:43:29] either leveraging basically anything,
[00:43:31] leveraging other people's time
[00:43:32] or abilities or knowledge or software,
[00:43:36] all of these different things.
[00:43:38] I think the big mistake is,
[00:43:40] I fall into the trap of,
[00:43:42] oh, if I want it done right,
[00:43:43] I need to do it myself.
[00:43:44] And I think everything from,
[00:43:47] I don't need to go to every showing.
[00:43:49] I can have a showing agent do it
[00:43:51] or I don't need to pretend like I know stuff
[00:43:54] that I don't, let's go call them in or let's employ
[00:43:58] other people on my team and train them
[00:44:01] so that they can go do things better than I could on my own.
[00:44:04] I think that's the thing that I struggle with the most.
[00:44:07] And so it's not even a mistake that I made one time
[00:44:10] at some point I'm still working through.
[00:44:11] I try to hold on to things longer than I should
[00:44:15] instead of delegating them
[00:44:17] and putting them into the hands of people
[00:44:19] who can do them better than me.
[00:44:22] My boss has always said,
[00:44:24] if you, if you delegate something, assume,
[00:44:27] and again, this is not like written in stone,
[00:44:29] but this is his philosophy,
[00:44:30] assume that they'll,
[00:44:32] that the person you delegate the task to
[00:44:34] will do it to about 70 to 80% of what you would do.
[00:44:38] So it's not gonna be perfect.
[00:44:39] It's gonna be 70 to 80% perfect.
[00:44:42] And then maybe you come in and tweak the little,
[00:44:45] last 20, 30% of it.
[00:44:47] But even that would be pretty helpful, right?
[00:44:50] So like even if they don't quite get it
[00:44:52] to the Tony Clark perfect perfection level,
[00:44:54] they can get you at 70, three quarters of the way there
[00:44:58] and then you just run the ball into the end zone.
[00:45:02] That's a pretty good deal, but it's hard
[00:45:05] because you do have to accept less than perfect work
[00:45:10] because Tony, you have very specific standards,
[00:45:13] high standards for whatever task
[00:45:16] you may be delegating to somebody
[00:45:18] and you have very specific rules and structure.
[00:45:22] But you do have to sort of accept slightly less than
[00:45:25] for delegation.
[00:45:27] And that to me has always been the hardest part
[00:45:28] of curious if you struggle with that as well.
[00:45:31] Oh, absolutely.
[00:45:33] And I'd say it's even a pendulum
[00:45:34] where I struggle with either letting go too much
[00:45:37] or not letting go enough,
[00:45:39] where if I hire somebody to do something,
[00:45:40] I've got, hey, a virtual assistant who he's awesome,
[00:45:44] he's been working for me for about a year,
[00:45:45] year and a half now.
[00:45:48] And when I keep going back and forth with him,
[00:45:51] even still where I'll micromanage too much
[00:45:54] and then I'll let the reins out too much
[00:45:56] as far as I don't give him enough direction,
[00:45:58] not like I let him slack off or whatever.
[00:46:00] It's just, hey, here's a task, go do this
[00:46:02] and he's like, well, Tony, how do I do this?
[00:46:05] Or you know what, give me more direction.
[00:46:08] And it's really finding that balance of saying,
[00:46:11] okay, and a new skill set also of managing people,
[00:46:14] that's very different than doing things yourself.
[00:46:17] And I'm still very much learning that,
[00:46:19] but I think that's right on where, you know, 70, 80%,
[00:46:22] there's the expectation.
[00:46:24] And then you figure out how to encourage and uplift
[00:46:28] and keep accountable anybody who is working for you.
[00:46:33] Yeah, it's really an impressive thing.
[00:46:37] And we now, we are in a global economy.
[00:46:39] So for anyone out there who is, you know, thinking,
[00:46:42] I can't afford an assistant, you might be able
[00:46:45] to afford an assistant in your local market,
[00:46:47] but you might be able to afford an assistant
[00:46:48] from another country, another part of the world
[00:46:50] who were the economics are different,
[00:46:53] where the cost of living is different
[00:46:55] and we can get virtual assistants
[00:46:58] who will only want a certain amount of pay
[00:47:02] that you might be able to afford.
[00:47:04] So if you are struggling, you know,
[00:47:06] upwork is a great website to find talent globally
[00:47:10] to help you with whatever you're struggling with.
[00:47:14] And if you're not a numbers guy, higher numbers guy,
[00:47:16] you can find them all over the world.
[00:47:18] And if you're, you know, need help in any other way,
[00:47:20] obviously Tony's leveraging that.
[00:47:22] And he's saying the same thing
[00:47:23] that all of us struggle with is we want to do everything ourselves
[00:47:27] because, you know, we have a vision
[00:47:29] for exactly how things should look, feel and sound,
[00:47:31] but having people help you
[00:47:34] and you can get help from all over the world now
[00:47:36] we're so fortunate.
[00:47:37] So I want everyone who's listening to plea,
[00:47:40] oh, one more thing, I'm sorry,
[00:47:42] I'm interrupting myself,
[00:47:43] but for anyone out there who is a REALTOR
[00:47:47] in the Nashville area in particular, you know,
[00:47:50] any Tennessee REALTORS,
[00:47:53] I want you to check out Tony's brokerage,
[00:47:56] which is a house haven in Tennessee,

[00:48:05] and he's like, oh, I'll introduce to my managing broker,
[00:48:08] he's a total superstar.
[00:48:11] So if you are an agent in that market
[00:48:14] and you're like, I'm not getting the tools,
[00:48:16] the training, the support that I need for my existing firm,
[00:48:20] I don't want to go work at a firm
[00:48:21] where a guy just knocked out 40 million in a year and a half,
[00:48:24] like that's a pretty cool place to me,
[00:48:26] but they have a few nuggets of wisdom over there, house haven.

Today on the show, we have Tony Clark, from Beverly and Company in California, also with House Haven in Tennessee. Let me tell you more about Tony. Now Tony is a real estate agent with a background in both real estate sales and investment real estate strategy. Now this is incredible, everyone. So please, please check this out. In his first 18 months as a REALTOR, he closed over 40 million in volume. He also realized the importance that good systems make in a real estate agents business.

And I also really want you to check out his new CRM. And we're going to find out more about that today as well, which is realtiflo.io. Again, realtiflo.io link to that will also be in the show notes. Tony, welcome to the show. Hey, thanks for having me. I'm excited to be here. I'm excited to talk to you. I rarely, it's funny. I've been doing this show for five or six years now. And I always feel like I've seen and heard it all from our guests who are all superstars in the industry. But rarely do I get to talk to a lawyer like a rookie superstar. And not only did you close 40 million in your first year and a half, which is insane, obviously. But you also are practicing now in two states and two markets, which is even more incredible. I know you're mostly in California, but you also practice in Tennessee Nashville as well. So let's get, let's start at the very, very beginning, which is not a much that long ago. But I'd love to know how you got into real estate and why. Yeah, I jumped into real estate actually from the investment space. I worked at a private equity firm that did residential real estate, just kind of wanted to learn the ropes. I was all the way back when I was a kid. I was that kid trying to sell baseball cards to his friends or try to flip golf clubs in high school. You know, just the stereotypical business-minded kid. And I always say houses are just bigger toys than the stuff that we sell growing up. But yes, so started at a private equity fund, kind of learning the investment side. They were based out of California, but bought in different markets in the southeast. And so I was essentially acting as a real estate agent for them, but just sourcing properties for them and running deal analysis and really got a lot of good experience there, but realized pretty quickly that basically, what I was doing for them was being a real estate agent who could only have one client. And so I wound up transitioning from the fund to getting my license and actually wound up moving to Tennessee with my wife after I got licensed so that we could start investing ourselves and build a clientele there, which was where I was really focused on when I was at the private equity fund. Wow. And were there lessons that you learned working in PE, private equity that you were able to bring into the individual sort of REALTOR practice? Absolutely. I think the big thing that I learned from private equity is whether you're buying one house or a thousand, it all comes down to the numbers, at least when you're looking at investment real estate, that when you're looking at a deal or looking at a market, it's all about understanding one of the risks that come with investing in that market and then also what your numbers look like. We're at the end of the day if it works on the spreadsheet and you've accounted for the risks, you have a much better chance of that property of being a good asset or a good buy and that translates to them working with individuals where it, again, doesn't matter if it's a big fund or someone looking to buy their first property, you can just get down to the numbers and the end of the day it is a big financial decision that they're making. Since I so rarely get to talk to anyone with your background, I just have a quick question and again, I know you're still newer to this industry but you have this unique perspective. Was it any surprise to you to see the Ibuyer start to, the Ibuyers start to fade away? You're talking about numbers, right? It's all about the numbers and we're seeing companies that really should have those numbers locked in pretty well and I'm not here to disparage companies like Zillow. I love Zillow, but even they got it wrong, right? So it's interesting. What do you think's going on on the Ibuyer side? Yeah, it's one of those things that the model that the Ibuyers use is so tough to do at scale. It was really the PE fund that I was at was trying to do one-to-four unit residential properties at scale and they were a small fund with a few hundred houses and I couldn't imagine a fund bigger than them doing what they're doing. You have to manage so many people and so many contractors and keep so many things straight that even if you have multiple levels of management, it's just tough to get that right. And especially when you're buying with such tight margins which is what we would see them doing. I know I brought a couple of properties to those Ibuyers didn't do a lot of work with them, but even the prices that they had to pay for the properties in order to win them and then try to sell them for higher. It's just a... Like were you able to look at those and say like they're overpaying, this is crazy? Oh yeah. Oh, I was like either they're much smarter than me because I have a lot of money on it. Or something is, something isn't adding up and I'm not gonna say I'm smart enough to go pay more than they are for this house. So I'm just gonna let it be. Well, turns out they were wrong. So... That's so good. But so, but let's, so aren't, that's, and I'm sorry, I didn't mean to get us off track, but I figured I got Tony, he knows the private equity world. I was like, what's going on with all these Ibuyers? But let's get to the real meat of this because the really impressive thing you did in the first 18 months is close 40 million in production and that is, that puts you in the top one tenth of one percent of new REALTORS in the whole country. I mean, probably even more than the top 10, one tenth of one percent. So you were at this very elite level. I don't think success happens by accident. Maybe unless you had a friend who had a $40 million property, that would be sold. It was a one-trick, that's action. And I would say, even that I want to hear that story too, but I don't think that was what happened. So how did you do it? Every one of our listeners and viewers is like, they're dripping with jealousy just like I am. How did you do it? And what might you suggest to agents who want to duplicate that sort of success? Yeah, I mean, I think it was really a mix of a few things. And the first was, I did get very lucky with both the timing and the market that I was in. So there were some things that I did, and I'll talk about that, but starting with, getting into real estate right during the COVID boom, and then being in Nashville, Tennessee, which is one of the more talked about investment markets, definitely were some tailwinds that helped. So, but then within that, I know when I first got my license, I had a mentor who kind of told me, he said, hey, the first thing you need to do is find a niche. And for me, I'd kind of thought that investment real estate made sense, but also, was like, who's going to listen to a kid in their mid 20s, tell them about investment properties? So it was this kind of, apparently a lot of people. That's yeah. And so I really, that mentor was really pushing me on that. And I said, okay, I'm not going to do any marketing. The first time home buyers, I'm not going to do any marketing for luxury real estate. I'm just going to focus on this for six months, and we'll see how it goes. And it was definitely slow getting started those first few months. You just kind of bumble around and try things that don't work and try some things that work. And I think at least when I was first starting out, it was niching down and saying, I'm just going to focus on investors. And even within that saying, I'm looking for a very specific type of investor. And I think this can go for any real estate agent, who even if investors isn't your niche, but let's say it's first time home buyers. For me, I said, I'm looking for investors who need loans on the property, where they're not the flippers that are paying all cash and going to go flip 50 houses. I don't want to go write a bunch of offers for them and get rejected. I'm looking for an investor who has enough money for a down payment and is looking for a rental that's just going to give them monthly income. There's a lot more of those out there, and there's less, it's kind of this sweet spot where there haven't been as many REALTORS at least that I saw in Nashville who focused on that. And so once I identified that niche, then it was just asking the question, well, okay, where are they at? Where can I find them? And then it turned into a lot of just, let's go to real estate meetups and let's go bigger pockets was a big sort of. Let's go find those people, essentially. I'm going to pause you for a second because I want for anyone who is listening who is a little bit lost on like what Tony's talking about. So his niche was he wants to work with investors. He wants buy and hold investors who need loans. So we've now identified his niche. Now you might be thinking, well, where does Tony find these people who, and there are places to find it, but my question is actually going to be a different question, Tony, is it, it's been my experience talking to other investors and people in this industry who do what you do, that finding the investors is actually the easy part. My suspicion is finding the deal is step number one. In other words, finding those opportunities to then present to a versus, now traditional primary residence home buyers, they can look on Zellow, they can look on Redfin. Agent isn't always the one that finds the property. You know, the buyer is usually finding the property and bringing it to the REALTOR. I want to go see that place. Now, for on the investor side, I'm guessing it's you finding the deal and then you saying, here's a cash flow opportunity and then going to your pool of investors, by the way, for anyone who isn't familiar with bigger pockets, it is the largest online forum for real estate investors in the country, it is by far the top of the mountain. If you ever really want to get a good education and understand how investors think and talk to each other, it's basically like Reddit for investors. That's what it is. It's where you can, it's a social component. I've had the bigger pockets guys on my show before I love those guys, they're just awesome. And it is a great place to learn how to talk to investors. But anyway, was I right about that that finding the opportunity is really the hard part and finding the money and then investors is the easy part? Absolutely. I think that's the first step being finding the investors as far as, you know, if you find a great deal, but nobody can buy it, then you're kind of out of luck. But that's definitely the easy part. And I think then going and finding the deal comes down to even, first I think understanding who you're working with on the investor side and what they're looking for. That was something that I learned from the private equity fund that I took into real estate was, let me sit down with this investor and work through exactly what they're looking for in a property. And without getting too technical on the investment side, basically saying, you know, here is either the return that you're looking for or what kind of neighborhood are you looking for as far as how quickly it's growing versus how stable or, you know, what not, let's sit down and figure out what you're looking for and then go find properties that fit that box. It's the same thing when I work with, because I will take clients on who are looking to buy their first home or friends and family. And it's the same thing as, you know, I could love a house that we go see, but if it's not the kind of house that they're looking for, I just wasted both of our time. And so to really get narrowed down in their criteria, that then gives me a better feel for going out and finding those properties so that when I present it to them, I want to know how to present it and say, look, this is what fits your goals. And also I can kind of weed out a lot of the properties that don't. So kind of winds up being an easier way to search. So basically you meet with an investor, you say, okay, what are you looking for? In other words, is there an annualized rate of return that you'd like to have? Is the K1 for tax deduction the most important thing? Is it the income? Is it the appreciation? So Tony walks his, or doesn't walk people through, he finds out exactly what his investors want and need. And then he says, okay, I get it. I know what you want. Now my job is to go find these properties. So here's question number two. So now you've identified the needs of the client. And now it's, okay, now you've got to find the hard part, the property. Where are you finding the properties? What percentage of the time are the properties on the MLS? And what percentage of the time are you doing creative ways to find things that are not available on the MLS? Yeah, I would say it shifted, even within the past couple of years, it's definitely shifted. Where early on it was more off market, I would go just try to network with people. So I'd go to not necessarily real estate agent events, but real estate investor events or business networking groups and just ask everyone I knew I'd say, hey, I've got somebody who's looking for X, Y, Z type property. Do you know of anybody? And then I'd put them into my follow-up system and just follow up with them saying, I've got a buyer looking for this. Do you have anything? And same thing with wholesalers. I would go find wholesalers or investors and say, do you have anything coming up? Keep me on your list. And it was really just finding the people who were out there hunting for deals daily and then keeping in touch with them. And that I think was key for finding those properties. So you weren't sending all these mailers to these multi-family buildings or whatever, saying, hey, I want to buy your property, which some people do and have success with that. You can go knock on doors. You either are ways to find properties that aren't even, aren't listed at all. But that are, you know, mom and pop may, you know, owns a multi-family. And there's a million different ways and there are much, much better podcasts than this, specifically for how to creatively find those properties. We're not real estate investing podcasts per se, but I was curious. But you do sometimes find them on the MLS as well, I'm guessing. Yeah, absolutely. And it was probably, I'd say close to 50-50, where the MLS was a lot more of what you were talking about if they were looking for just a property to park money in or some, you know, a few new builds that were going to be nice corporate rentals. Or, you know, you find properties on the MLS, but I'd always just tell my clients, I'd say, hey, I'll set you up. I said, I have a three-step process where I will set you up on the auto search for properties. And this, I think, works with any client where I'd say, I'll set you up on the auto search. So if I'm away from my office or whatever reason, you get the properties and you don't have to rely on me seeing them. I'll also see see myself on the auto search and that step too. And I go through that once a day. So if there's something that really jumps out to me, then I'll reach out to you directly as well. So it can be, there's two-way conversation, you know, that I'm actively looking for you. And then three is the off-market properties. And that's, you know, I'll really be personally reaching out to you on those. But I think that helped me win a lot of clients initially where they said, oh, he's going to do more than just set me up on an auto search and wait for me to respond and just kind of earn some trust early on. And how important is it to be active in these online forums like bigger pockets so that you can get access to this huge network of people who want to invest and also learn? I mean, I tell everyone if you want the best education about how to add the service of being able to support clients who want real estate investment advice and what those kind of deals, bigger pockets is, I can't think of a better place to go than that. But how important is that for the education and also the networking? Oh, absolutely. I think it's big. If people, it's just reaching out and letting people know that you're there to add value, I think that's the big thing is if you're there to learn and to add value, that networking is big because everybody can kind of see through if you show up with the business card to the networking events, hey, call me if you're gonna buy cell property and they'll add your card to the list of 20 other people. But if you're there and you're either very interested in learning about their experience and that's where I see real estate agents and lenders and people who do that really well, they're there to learn and then they're there to add value of even if it's just one tidbit. I learned this from one of my mentors, he's like, hey, find one thing about your market that most real estate agents don't know. And you can just throw that into your first conversation. Nashville, it was within the Nashville Metro, there were two different tax districts and one, you paid about half the property taxes you did the other. And I would just throw that into my first conversation where I would like to know that if I was moving to Nashville, yeah. Absolutely. And I'd say, hey, here's, you know, it's the briley loop, the freeway if you essentially if you're inside that, your property taxes are gonna be almost twice what they will if you're outside. And all of a sudden you've added value and built trust, but you can only do that if you get in front of people either networking online or in person. And so I think that's huge. I think that's a big, big value add. Yeah, I, what, A-Again, you've really only been practicing as a REALTOR for a short amount of time. What percentage of agents do you think have your particular skill set with respect to real estate investment? Like I'm just gonna throw a number I'm completely making out of whole cloth. I'm gonna say less than 3% of REALTOR is probably focus in the market that you're in or focus in real estate investing. Would that be a roughly fair? Yeah, it's, that's a question that honestly, I haven't been around enough or in enough markets to see in Nashville. I will say so now being in Nashville and in California, that percentage was much higher in Nashville, I think just because there's so much. Because Nashville was exploding there. That's, yeah, but it was, it's still low. I mean, it's still, I think that three to five percent there and then probably, you know, one percent or less that really focus on real estate in California or on investing where I am in California. It's such a nice additional avenue to add. So, you know, and again, you can't be all things to all people. You're like, hey, I'm not a luxury guy. I'm not a first time home buyer guy. I mean, you could be and you could, you could get your way through those deals, obviously. But it's not your main focus, but it's a nice thing. You know, if it was me and I, I guess it's all about what you're into. Like you came from that world, you came from the PE world. It's what you're into, you're a numbers guy, you're a systems guy and let's actually, let's switch to systems because that is, you know, anyone can grind out, not anyone. But a lot of times people think, well, Tony did 40 million in 18 months and his first 18 months, he must have just grinded it out and you probably did. But I'm curious to know what systems helped make them a little bit easier for you because I imagine you were working pretty long hours to get to those numbers. Yeah, it was really definitely trying to figure out how to take what I was doing. My motto as far as growing and scaling is I say, okay, let's work really hard. And then let's figure out how to simplify what I'm doing so that I can scale bigger. And then work really hard, simplify scale. Like that's kind of how I think about it. And so the first few months that I was in the business, it was let's just call everyone I can on my cell phone or go through Facebook or you know, keep a Google sheet and then realize that's not sustainable for anything. And so then started using a CRM and really keeping track of my contacts and trying to set tasks for myself to follow up with people and trying to, you know, still make it personal because we've all seen the automated emails where you know that you're on a mailing list and it sounds like a mailing list and you burn trust that way. So I said, well, I don't want to do that. But let's figure out how to keep in touch with my clients and really just organize my database because like you were talking about with, oh, go ahead. No, I didn't mean to interrupt your flow. I'm super excited to hear about how systems you built to do this. Yeah. Yeah, so it was really, the first one was my database and at first I used the CRM that was provided from my brokerage and then tried a couple others but it was really more the functions of, I would, anybody who went into my database or anyone I've met went into my database. I'll start there and then I tagged them as whether they were, you know, buyer, seller, vendor, friend, whoever and then they'd get added to a couple of things where one, I just had a newsletter that I pushed out and it wasn't anything groundbreaking. I didn't spend a lot of time on it but it was just, hey, you know, I'm in the market. Here's a little tidbit to add value. And then from there, I always knew, you know, one, I would be able to fish kind of with that newsletter and then anyone who was active, I really kept track of where they were in the process and what they were expecting from me if I had active clients, I would know that hand, I'd call them every couple days or every day or, you know, whatnot and then anybody who was still a new lead, I'd push them through. I did have a few automated campaigns and templates and things I'd use for new leads. And it was really, I would just develop those based off of if I did something once I'd say, let's figure out a way to simplify this the next time. So let's put automation or a task in and then let's figure out how to do 100 times more work with that same system without it breaking. So you'd meet with a client and you'd get a sense of what their expectations are of you and you would identify those and probably arrive at some sort of agreements, like whether it's verbal or just in terms of you're like, okay, I know what I need to do for this client, which means I'm going to call them either every day, every other day, every three days. You made that determination, of course, every client can be different. And you make that determination and then you set up the repeating tasks so that you don't forget. And again, this sounds so basic. However, the basics are, the fundamentals are usually when the game. And so as silly as it is to go, remember every three days in your calendar, you have to call so and so. It's funny, I told this story before and I apologize for our audience that has heard it, ad nauseam, but I talked to one of the top agents in Chicago here many years ago. And I said, what do you think? It's literally out of 46,000 agents, she's number one. And I was like, how did you, what, what, what, why are you number one? And, you know, what did you do different? She goes, DJ, I call every one of my clients every week. And I go, and she's like, well, the active clients, right? And she goes, yeah, active clients. And I said, and like, yeah, so, you know, not so, but kind of I was expecting a bigger. And she goes, well, obviously there's a million other things she does, but she goes, that's my secret sauce. And I was like, it's, it's that. And she goes, I know it sounds really silly, right? And she goes, that's it. She goes, you'd be shocked. Most agents don't. They're afraid to call their clients unless it's good news. So, so curious to get your thoughts like, when you know you have to call them every couple of days, do you already know? I mean, unless it's like new news that you don't prevent them, do you know sort of what you're gonna say? Yeah, typically it'll be, and whether it's a, you know, I say call, sometimes it would be a text. I'd use the word communicate of, you know, get in touch with them to stay top of mind. And yeah, when there was no news, it would really just be a quick, usually just a quick text of saying, hey, just wanted to check in with you nothing new on the market today or nothing new I've seen, but wanted to let you know I'm looking. And that was, that was it. They know that I'm looking for them, but there was nothing there. Not, I dropped off the face of the earth because they have it heard from me in two days and they're checking Zillow for three hours a day and feeling like their agent isn't, they're with them. Yeah, the number one reason people fire their agent is shocking, not shockingly communication. It's consistency communication. So, okay, so you now have these systems in place or with respect to communication. What other, tell me about how you began to develop your systems so that because again, that isn't necessarily super easy to scale, right? Because you have a certain amount of clients, you've certain number of phone calls or texts or emails you can make in a day. So, how do you sort of keep it all organized? Yeah, so what I started to do with the systems is, as I kept scaling, I said, okay, I need to push a system until it breaks where like you said the tasks. I let me just call everyone until I can't call everyone anymore and then let's step it up. And so, within my niche, what I wound up doing is I started tracking where I would lose clients. And I started to see like, okay, I'm getting X amount of leads in from, and you've mentioned bigger pockets. I've bought bigger pockets leads for a long time. And they were a rate lead source where they would come in and I had an automated workload come into my CRM. I'd hit them with an intro email that had a video in it saying here's a little bit about the market. I'd love to book a call with you. Here's my calendar invite. And then I just had a automated email in text that would go out every day to them just until they booked a meeting. And so that, you know, as one example, I realized that came out of me realizing that I was losing a lot of leads that came in because I even though I felt like I was reaching out to them quickly within, you know, 15, 30 minutes, it wasn't instantaneous and somebody else was. And isn't that amazing? That's like 15 to 30 minutes. It's almost like it happened to Centro and Go. Yeah. That's yeah, because by that point, they're done looking at properties and they're moving on to their next thing. And if somebody calls them right when they're looking, it's, you know, when I, if I need my lawn mode and I go call one lawn care company and they don't pick up, I'm just going to move on and call the next one. And it's, it's ridiculous when you're looking at it from the other side of things if we have such short attention spans, but it's such a big thing. So, but yeah, I would track really that being one example. I would track where I was losing leads and then try to figure out a way to plug that hole on if it was, okay, new leads are coming in and I'm converting them at, you know, 20% and I should be at 30 or I think I can get to 30. Let me go analyze that part of my business and make it better. And this is where I, I'm just a data numbers nerd on the side of things. And so I'd look at that or then I'd look at my pipeline and say, okay, I, you know, I'm getting a lot of good clients in, but then I'm not, you know, I'm losing them once they become clients and I should be converting higher here. Okay, that's because I'm not finding good deals for them. Let me go find more ways to find them properties or under contract. Am I not doing a good job of communicating with lenders or inspectors or getting bids from contractors? You know, there's, there's different factors at each stage of the client journey or after they bought a property, how much repeat business am I getting and if it's low, how can I follow up with them better? So there's these, I kind of developed five different stages where I could be losing clients and then I just try to optimize each one of those and make those better. So it's all basic stuff, but it's just putting a framework in to think through it. Well, pushups are basic too and they're also super annoying, right? So, so, I mean, I mean, that with the highest possible compliment because it's always these fundamentals and just as you were telling me, you know, I'm thinking about I'm a recruiter, basically recruit REALTORS. So I could, I was trying to apply this to my own systems of like, where do I lose recruits? Like, why do they end up choosing other firms and where in my process? But because I think that comes from that private equity large scale size, even though you weren't able to smaller firm or you had a smaller fund, you still were managing hundreds of houses and so this idea of scalability is obviously important. So you have to look for those weak points and this idea of doing an audit in your communication chain in your, you know, or just in your sales pipeline and looking at your five stages, identifying those weak points and plugging those holes as you said, boy, I'm loving that. And you're a numbers guy. So you're a metrics person. So everything is benchmarked and metriced and we know for above the line or below the line and for below. And what's really cool about real estate stuff is there's a lot of data out there that you can use to say what is the, you know, on a bigger pockets lead or a Zilla lead or whatever it might be. You know, the average close rate is this. I want to get to X. So a lot of this data is already there for you to benchmark against and it just helps you become super efficient, I imagine. Mm hmm. Absolutely. It's, and I think it's something that, not everybody in real estate, but I feel like most of us are pretty competitive too. And so if you can use data to say, oh, here's where the averages are, here's where the top tier are. I'm sitting, you know, below that, oh, what's it going to take for me to get there for me to get to the next level? And I think it's a good mesh of being able to use those data points to push yourself to be better. Yeah, I mean, even, I would even encourage all of our listeners or viewers, if there's someone in your local market who's a REALTOR that you admire that has like a very, you know, some really impressive numbers, whether it's production, whether it's a days on market, whether it's, you know, percentage or list price, whatever the metric is that you're like, how do they do that? Literally call them and be like, I am so enamored with the way that you do X, Y, or Z. I'm your biggest fan. I noticed you do all these things. Could I grab 15 minutes of your day? I'll buy you coffee or lunch or whatever. I promise you that will be in call five of those people. One of those people, if not all five, will take that 15 minutes and have you ever done that? Where are you reaching out to other mentor? Are you said you have mentors? Yeah, absolutely. I think that's something that either both within my market and Nashville, I did that a few times and then even outside of the market, I'd find somebody who was out in Ohio or Pennsylvania where they're just crushing it in their market, but I'd say, hey, you know, one big fan would love to, even an investment real estate, it was the, hey, I can add value, I would love to push people your way if they're not a fit for Nashville. Like the numbers look good in your market or whatever, you know, would love to pick your brain for 15 minutes or, you know, usually instead of pick your brain, I don't like that saying as much. Yeah, so who cares now? Just, hey, I've got these three questions or here's the one thing I'm struggling with. Would you mind sharing what you do here because I see you doing it really well? And that's an easy answer for them. They don't have to think through, oh, what's he gonna ask? It's no, here's the question. Here's where they can add value and they're happy to get it. And it's super flattering to ask someone for their advice. It is what, we think maybe I will be annoying those people will be bothering them, maybe well, but good chance you won't be because they're gonna be so flattered that you've recognized something in their process that probably most people don't recognize. They just see them as successful or, and you're like, hey, I noticed you do this one thing. I'm, like you said, I'm such a fan of that. I would love to learn how you do that. And maybe I can add value to you and help you and et cetera. It's all about those connections and those, you almost have to be a fan of other agents. I think, I have learned that after almost 500 episodes, the top agents that I've had on this show, they're always like so happy to get, they get excited about other agents. Because they're like, oh, there's this other guy that does this really cool thing. And so I think that's part of it too. But knowing your numbers, right? We'll go back to systems. You gotta know your numbers. You gotta spend the time every single day studying your local market, studying your niche. You gotta know the numbers. And most agents, the good news is, most agents really don't know their numbers for being honest. So for the people that do spend that time and really niche down and figure out where they, they blossom and bloom. And it's just, it's so impressive because most agents aren't gonna spend that time doing it. Yeah, yeah, absolutely. And so I think if that's you, and either if your number's driven, or even if you're not, but you're able to take a little bit of time and run through it, you have such a leg up on the competition. Or you'll at least, and I'd love to hear your take on this too. I think that's how you can build a sustainable business. You're never chasing the next client then. You say, here's my marketing budget for this month, or here's how many people I need to call. Or if I do this, then this will happen within reason. Markets can change and shift, but you're never, I would think you'll be less stressed on when's the next deal coming in, because you're focused on those things that you can control to make that next deal happen. Totally. And all that we can ever really control is our thoughts and actions, right? So it's like, yeah. That's all we can control. And the good news is we can control it mostly. But I wanna talk about Realty Flow. This is your CRM because you're a systems guy, and you were looking for a CRM solution for your particular niche, and you were like, you couldn't really find one that was a perfect fit. You're like, I'm gonna build one. So, and by the way, many people have attempted this. This is not, this is a tough, tough business, but I wanna, if I was gonna, you know, I would be looking at a CRM from a guy who did 40 billion in his first 18 months, that seems like a guy I'd wanna follow. So tell us about Realty Flow and what you're looking to do with that. Yeah, it really, so Realty Flow came out of the, essentially came out of the consulting firm that I've been running for the last few months on, basically I've been going in, and exactly what we just talked through with other real estate agents saying, hey, I'll come in, I'll help you audit your numbers, I'll help you look at, you know, what systems you're using and let's figure out ways to streamline your business and kind of come in and do that. I went through that a few times with agents and realized that there were some similarities between really agents at different productivity levels of, you know, the top, top tier agents, usually have their systems pretty dialed, a lot of newer agents. It, their systems were like giving a Ferrari to a 15 year old, who hasn't learned how to drive yet. On, you know, you get these big CRMs that can do a million different things, but really you just need a way to manage your contacts, track deals, manage tasks, which that was the one weird one that I just, most CRMs don't have just like a Google tasks kind of thing, where you can just put sticky notes in, it all has to be assigned to contacts and whatever, and then just do, you know, basic automated texting and emailing and then tracking those things. And so from that, I was able to link up with a couple of business partners that I worked with one before and one is a developer, software developer, and then other lens, and they just finished another project, and they were like, hey, Tony, you know what, what are you working on? And it just kind of mashed where we decided we were gonna launch a real estate CRM, really with the same model or mantra that I've been using for my business on just, this is designed to simplify your business so that you can scale. And so that you can then go work hard on your business and then simplify it through the system and then scale. And so it's really, it's not meant to be anything groundbreaking other than just here as a clean, simple way to look at everything in your business instead of a convoluted dashboard with a thousand different things going on that you have to sift through. So. I think what a lot of times CRMs are, you know, they're built by developers and developers aren't necessarily real estate agents. Sometimes they are, sometimes they're not, mostly they're not. And so I think sometimes CRM companies, tech companies, get some of the tools a little bit wrong only in the sense of understanding that providing, you know, all of these different features, functionality is great. But what it can result in for especially a newer agent is a lot of anxiety. So they get this, like you said, they get, you know, their CRM, which is fully featured, has all these amazing tools. And yet it becomes overwhelming because there's so much, it's basically a blank canvas with all these different, you know, all this different paint, all, you know, a million paint colors. And it's like, ooh, what do I do? So you're looking to sort of simplify the process, streamline it, make it really accessible to agents so that they can plug in and scale up. Exactly. And I think just designing it, you hit it right on the head, designing something that's four real estate agents because a lot of these big companies, it's a CRM that works really well for an enterprise, Fortune 500 company with five levels of management. Sure. It needs to do a lot more than a real estate agent or even a brokerage or a team where you're tracking very specific things. And it's really just saying, let's remove all the stuff that would work well for other industries, but that you don't need in real estate and then do the things that you need in real estate, really, really well. And then let's bring in some fun stuff, like we pulled in chat GPT so you can write listing descriptions and some other things. We just pulled that in so that you can do all of that from the CRM. But it's really like, let's do the essentials really, really well and get rid of them. Yeah, the fundamentals. Let's keep the machine oiled and running. I love it. So I would encourage everyone to check out realtiflo.io, check out, you can do demos there, you can see the CRM in inaction and hopefully maybe become a client. So check out realtiflo.io. Also, I want everybody to follow Tony at on Instagram, TonyClark.realestate. We have links to both of those in our show notes. Tony, one last question. Now, you've had a tremendous amount of success in the last 18 months, which again, it's like blowing me away, you're a success. And by the way, hugely jealous of you. So amazing, amazing success there. Jealousy in the most positive way. What were Miss, give us one mistake that you made or something that you're struggling with right now just so that we know you're human. We know that you have your own struggles. Oh, how much time do we have on the list? Yeah, I think the, if I were to think back kind of the number one mistake that I make over and over is I try to do too much instead of leveraging, either leveraging basically anything, leveraging other people's time or abilities or knowledge or software, all of these different things. I think the big mistake is, I fall into the trap of, oh, if I want it done right, I need to do it myself. And I think everything from, I don't need to go to every showing. I can have a showing agent do it or I don't need to pretend like I know stuff that I don't, let's go call them in or let's employ other people on my team and train them so that they can go do things better than I could on my own. I think that's the thing that I struggle with the most. And so it's not even a mistake that I made one time at some point I'm still working through. I try to hold on to things longer than I should instead of delegating them and putting them into the hands of people who can do them better than me. My boss has always said, if you, if you delegate something, assume, and again, this is not like written in stone, but this is his philosophy, assume that they'll, that the person you delegate the task to will do it to about 70 to 80% of what you would do. So it's not gonna be perfect. It's gonna be 70 to 80% perfect. And then maybe you come in and tweak the little, last 20, 30% of it. But even that would be pretty helpful, right? So like even if they don't quite get it to the Tony Clark perfect perfection level, they can get you at 70, three quarters of the way there and then you just run the ball into the end zone. That's a pretty good deal, but it's hard because you do have to accept less than perfect work because Tony, you have very specific standards, high standards for whatever task you may be delegating to somebody and you have very specific rules and structure. But you do have to sort of accept slightly less than for delegation. And that to me has always been the hardest part of curious if you struggle with that as well. Oh, absolutely. And I'd say it's even a pendulum where I struggle with either letting go too much or not letting go enough, where if I hire somebody to do something, I've got, hey, a virtual assistant who he's awesome, he's been working for me for about a year, year and a half now. And when I keep going back and forth with him, even still where I'll micromanage too much and then I'll let the reins out too much as far as I don't give him enough direction, not like I let him slack off or whatever. It's just, hey, here's a task, go do this and he's like, well, Tony, how do I do this? Or you know what, give me more direction. And it's really finding that balance of saying, okay, and a new skill set also of managing people, that's very different than doing things yourself. And I'm still very much learning that, but I think that's right on where, you know, 70, 80%, there's the expectation. And then you figure out how to encourage and uplift and keep accountable anybody who is working for you. Yeah, it's really an impressive thing. And we now, we are in a global economy. So for anyone out there who is, you know, thinking, I can't afford an assistant, you might be able to afford an assistant in your local market, but you might be able to afford an assistant from another country, another part of the world who were the economics are different, where the cost of living is different and we can get virtual assistants who will only want a certain amount of pay that you might be able to afford. So if you are struggling, you know, upwork is a great website to find talent globally to help you with whatever you're struggling with. And if you're not a numbers guy, higher numbers guy, you can find them all over the world. And if you're, you know, need help in any other way, obviously Tony's leveraging that. And he's saying the same thing that all of us struggle with is we want to do everything ourselves because, you know, we have a vision for exactly how things should look, feel and sound, but having people help you and you can get help from all over the world now we're so fortunate. So I want everyone who's listening to plea, oh, one more thing, I'm sorry, I'm interrupting myself, but for anyone out there who is a REALTOR in the Nashville area in particular, you know, any Tennessee REALTORS, I want you to check out Tony's brokerage, which is a house haven in Tennessee, they're an amazing company, Tony was telling me offline about I was say Tony, you're an amazing, you know, 40 million in your first year and a half and he's like, oh, I'll introduce to my managing broker, he's a total superstar. So if you are an agent in that market and you're like, I'm not getting the tools, the training, the support that I need for my existing firm, I don't want to go work at a firm where a guy just knocked out 40 million in a year and a half, like that's a pretty cool place to me, but they have a few nuggets of wisdom over there, house haven. So definitely reach out to Tony, you can find him on Instagram, Tony Clark.realistate. Also check out his CRM realtiflo.io.io and Tony also practices in Ventura, cal, all over the LA area.
