[00:01:22] Today's episode is brought to you by Corded.io.
[00:01:25] Are you looking for agents to join your brokerage team?
[00:01:29] Now, as a real estate recruiter, I can tell you the answer is always yes.
[00:01:34] But most agents aren't looking to move right now.
[00:01:36] So how do you know who to contact?
[00:01:39] Well, what if I were to tell you there's a recruiting and retention tool powered by
[00:01:42] artificial intelligence that shows you exactly which agents in your local market are looking
[00:01:48] to leave their brokerage right now and which agents at your own firm are also looking
[00:01:53] to leave you?
[00:01:54] Now, I've been recruiting REALTORS for 15 years and I've hired over 2,000 agents.
[00:01:59] I can tell you with no exaggeration, this is the tool I've been waiting for.
[00:02:03] Corded.io looks for trends across dozens of variables for each agent in your market
[00:02:08] and shows you which agents they believe are likely to move.
[00:02:12] Not only does it do that, but Corded.io went and visited my recruiting website and read
[00:02:17] everything I offer.
[00:02:18] So now when I'm recruiting, Corded's AI tells me exactly what to say based on that
[00:02:24] agent's needs and what my brokerage can offer.
[00:02:26] It even writes emails for me.
[00:02:28] I've never seen anything like it and I use it every single day.
[00:02:33] Now, if you are looking to grow your brokerage, Corded.io is the best tool out there.

[00:02:41] That's Corded.io.
[00:02:43] And now, onto the show.
[00:02:58] Hello and welcome to another episode of Keeping It Real, the largest podcast made by real estate
[00:03:03] agents and four real estate agents.
[00:03:06] My name is DJ Paris.
[00:03:07] I am your guide and host through the show.
[00:03:09] And just a moment, we're going to be speaking with top producer Karina Chavez.
[00:03:13] Before we get to Karina, actually, before I even go forward, I have to tell you I
[00:03:17] made a horrible mistake.
[00:03:19] And when I introduced Karina because normally what I do before the podcast, of course, I
[00:03:24] by prepare, I have all of my notes in front of me.
[00:03:26] And I had forgotten to grab her Instagram.
[00:03:29] And so I just assumed, well, there's probably only one Karina Chavez in real estate, which
[00:03:33] I don't know why I thought that.
[00:03:34] But there was more than one Karina real estate, Karina Chavez.
[00:03:38] And I pulled up the wrong one, somebody from Southern California and I didn't notice it.
[00:03:42] And when I introduced her, when I introduced her, you'll hear I introduced her as a
[00:03:46] 20th Century 21 agent.
[00:03:48] And that is not her.
[00:03:49] She is a Keller Williams agent.
[00:03:50] And I give the wrong Instagram account.
[00:03:52] I correct it at the very end.
[00:03:54] But the, you know, I made a mistake at the beginning.
[00:03:57] So for all of you and you should want to follow Karina because she's doing some really
[00:04:00] amazing things with development.
[00:04:02] You'll hear that here in a moment.
[00:04:04] But please follow her on Instagram.
[00:04:05] That is Chavez team REALTORS on Instagram.
[00:04:09] Chavez team REALTORS, my apologies to Karina.
[00:04:11] She's amazing.
[00:04:12] And really her story is going to touch you because as you're listening to it, realize that
[00:04:18] this is the kind of business you want to build.
[00:04:21] She is so amazing.
[00:04:23] She's so infectious.
[00:04:23] You're going to love her.
[00:04:24] And I also want to tell you, I have a tool for you that I want you to use as the listener.
[00:04:29] I built this for you.
[00:04:30] I actually used it myself to help sell my condo.
[00:04:33] I created a listing rewriter and not just taking your listing and throwing it in chat
[00:04:37] GPT. I actually, I'm doing that, but I'm actually having it go through six different rounds
[00:04:42] of rewrites.
[00:04:43] I'm also looking for all of the amenities in the area that you might not have thought
[00:04:46] about.
[00:04:47] We're going to add those in and even things inside the home that we're going to do with
[00:04:51] some research for and find that you might have missed.
[00:04:53] So I want you to try it out.
[00:04:54] It's totally free.
[00:04:55] It's my gift to you.
[00:04:56] It's listing.
[00:04:58] Join kale.com listing.
[00:05:01] Join kale.com.
[00:05:02] You just put in a current listing you have put in your, your listing description and a
[00:05:06] few just basic facts about the property, the address and bedrooms and bath and just
[00:05:10] a couple of things.
[00:05:10] Takes 20 seconds.
[00:05:12] Hit that button.
[00:05:12] Wait about a minute and it will see we create three different listing descriptions for
[00:05:17] you.
[00:05:17] All three are amazing.
[00:05:18] We also email it to you.
[00:05:20] Again, this is my way of saying thank you for being a dedicated, keeping it real
[00:05:23] listener.
[00:05:23] Please share this with a friend.
[00:05:25] You can share this link also with other REALTORS.
[00:05:27] Have them test it and let me know what you think.
[00:05:30] Does it help you?
[00:05:31] I just send it to one of the very top producers here in Chicago and she said, oh my gosh,
[00:05:35] this is better than I could write for her own listing descriptions and she does over
[00:05:40] 200 million herself every single year.
[00:05:42] So give it a shot listing.
[00:05:44] Join kale.com.
[00:05:45] Let me know how it works for you and let's get on to my conversation with Karina Shavez.
[00:06:05] Best advice has been always answered your phone.
[00:06:11] I think a lot of people take that for granted and it's such an easy one.
[00:06:16] It's something we should all be doing at all times.
[00:06:19] But I make it my priority.
[00:06:21] If we all have a life, we all have meetings, we all have things to do.
[00:06:24] But I make it a priority to at the end of the day, just go through all the missed phone
[00:06:27] calls, all the missed text messages and answer each and every one of them because you never
[00:06:31] know what you're going to get.
[00:06:33] It's a great one.
[00:06:35] I love now too with the technology as evolved at least on my iPhone.
[00:06:39] I don't know if Android users, I'm sure they have this as well.
[00:06:41] But now when people are leaving messages, you get to see the transcription in real time
[00:06:45] and you could interrupt and you can literally pick up like you used to be able to do with
[00:06:50] answering machines.
[00:06:51] So I love that that's the possibility now.
[00:06:53] So even if you don't answer it right away, you could pick it up mid sentence and be like,
[00:06:58] oh, I'm here.
[00:06:58] I'm here.
[00:06:59] Yes, yes, yes.
[00:07:01] You know, it's funny.
[00:07:01] I asked one of the top REALTORS here in Chicago and I mean, does 200 million dollars a year
[00:07:08] or herself and why she's so successful?
[00:07:12] And she didn't say I answered the phone, but she said something basically akin to that.
[00:07:17] She says, I call every one of my clients every week and I said, and she goes, no, that's
[00:07:23] it.
[00:07:24] I said, what do you mean?
[00:07:25] She says, I call every client I have every week and give them an update on what's going
[00:07:29] on.
[00:07:30] And I said, and I was like, there's got to be more to it.
[00:07:35] But she goes, well, there is more to it.
[00:07:37] But she goes, that is the consistency.
[00:07:40] So picking up your phone, doing those things, we take it for granted that everybody has
[00:07:44] those practices, but obviously everybody doesn't.
[00:07:47] Okay, worst piece of advice you've received in real estate.
[00:07:50] I think the worst piece of advice has been not to go on social media, not to adapt to
[00:07:55] changes.
[00:07:56] You know, it's like it's just like, you know, who has time for social media?
[00:07:58] It was time for TikTok or Instagram.
[00:08:01] And I'm like, it's the new way.
[00:08:03] It's a new way.
[00:08:03] I think it changes inevitable.
[00:08:05] I feel like in my industry in real estate, everything is constantly changing and it's either
[00:08:10] get on the boat or get lost.
[00:08:13] That's just the way it works.
[00:08:15] Yeah, I agree.
[00:08:17] I am not particularly strong on social media.
[00:08:20] Our podcast isn't particularly strong on social media.
[00:08:23] And this next year, I think we're going to have to hire somebody to help me with that
[00:08:28] because I don't spend much time on social media myself.
[00:08:31] And I'm missing out on a lot of opportunity to engage with our audience.
[00:08:35] But Karina Chavez is our guest today.
[00:08:38] I am so excited.
[00:08:39] And Karina is a real trooper.
[00:08:41] She actually fractured a bone on the day that we were going to record initially.
[00:08:47] And she is here now and we are, we honor her.
[00:08:50] She is with Century 21 All Stars in Albuquerque and is a total superstar.
[00:08:54] I really just want to tell you, I'm so sorry.
[00:08:58] I'm sorry, I can't tell everyone my apologies.
[00:08:59] Keller Williams in Albuquerque.
[00:09:03] And Karina Chavez, she's a real estate professional based in Albuquerque who specializes in helping
[00:09:07] investors and also first time home buyers.
[00:09:10] She built her brand around authenticity, community, and education, specifically educating clients
[00:09:16] so that they feel empowered in every step of the journey.
[00:09:19] Her work blends market knowledge with heart because buying a home is emotional as much as
[00:09:25] it is financial.
[00:09:26] I know this.
[00:09:26] I am doing this right now.
[00:09:27] I'm selling a home and buying a home and giving up that wonderful 3% loan that I no longer
[00:09:32] will have.
[00:09:33] But that is very emotional too.
[00:09:35] Karina's work blends market knowledge with heart.
[00:09:38] Oh, I'm sorry.
[00:09:39] She's known for her energetic Instagram presence, which by the way, we're going to promote
[00:09:43] her Instagram in just a moment where she shares real estate tips behind the scene stories
[00:09:47] and her life as a mom.
[00:09:49] She loves connecting with people, finding opportunities others might miss and creating
[00:09:53] experiences that make clients feel supported.
[00:09:56] She is doing something very cool on the development side.
[00:09:58] We're going to talk about in just a moment.
[00:10:00] Real estate is not just Karina's career.
[00:10:02] It is her calling over the last five years.
[00:10:04] She has dedicated a lot of her time into purchasing 1950s motels and converting them into
[00:10:09] affordable housing.
[00:10:11] How cool is that follow Karina on Instagram at Karinita sells social.
[00:10:17] I will have a link to that in the show notes.
[00:10:19] And so you don't have to worry about spelling it.
[00:10:21] Just go to the show notes.
[00:10:22] Click on it.
[00:10:23] Follow her.
[00:10:23] She has wonderful social media.
[00:10:25] Karina, welcome.
[00:10:27] Ahisam, thank you so much.
[00:10:28] That was a great introduction.
[00:10:29] You're amazing.
[00:10:31] Well, I will tell you my team.
[00:10:32] My team writes that for me thing goodness.
[00:10:35] And I will tell you I even screwed up on one of the so I apologize there, but you have
[00:10:40] done so many things.
[00:10:42] And I am really impressed with your ability to just try different avenues within real estate.
[00:10:51] And let's start at the beginning.
[00:10:54] Why real estate?
[00:10:55] How did you get in?
[00:10:56] You know what it has to do.
[00:10:58] Everything with my dad, everything I know comes from my dad.
[00:11:00] My dad has been or was it REALTOR for, you know, even in Mexico, he was a REALTOR.
[00:11:06] So I was born and raised in Guadalajara, Mexico.
[00:11:09] And in Guadalajara, he was a REALTOR and we moved here in 1984 and he's like, I am going
[00:11:14] to keep doing what I do.
[00:11:17] And I started helping my father because times were changing.
[00:11:20] You know, back in the day, you used to make an offer and send a fax.
[00:11:24] They're like, hey, check your fax machine.
[00:11:26] Make sure you didn't get any offers.
[00:11:27] And then it was email and dad had a hard time adapting to it.
[00:11:31] So I started helping him out and slowly we just merged and we worked together for 14
[00:11:37] years every day side by side.
[00:11:40] It was amazing working with my dad.
[00:11:42] You passed away last year.
[00:11:44] So I am now, it's personal.
[00:11:46] Now I really want to honor his memory and make it amazing.
[00:11:50] Well, that's a wonderful story by my condolences to your loss.
[00:11:55] And obviously you had a special bond with your father.
[00:11:58] There's something about daughters and fathers.
[00:12:00] There's a special bond there.
[00:12:02] And the fact that you got to work with him and share your passions is really what a blessing.
[00:12:09] So to continue on in his legacy.
[00:12:13] So I love that.
[00:12:15] What a heartwarming story.
[00:12:17] And so tell us a little bit about getting into the business.
[00:12:22] Now you're kind of running, running things yourself now.
[00:12:25] But let's start at the start.
[00:12:27] What did you learn from your dad?
[00:12:29] Because obviously he was successful.
[00:12:30] Your top 1% producer.
[00:12:32] What were some of the things that you saw him do with his clients that really impacted
[00:12:38] you?
[00:12:38] He treated them like human beings.
[00:12:40] He treated them like he was in their shoes.
[00:12:43] Like he always acted in their best interest.
[00:12:48] And closing day, if they struggled or if they had any issues with appliances, my dad would
[00:12:56] give them a refrigerator.
[00:12:57] He's like, you know what?
[00:12:58] Like, this is what I want for my people.
[00:13:00] Like, you're not going to do everything.
[00:13:02] You've got to the finish line.
[00:13:03] Let me take over the rest.
[00:13:05] Like my dad was just amazing.
[00:13:07] He treated you like you were family.
[00:13:10] And it was really cute because now I have like grandchildren.
[00:13:13] You know, like they're like, hey, your dad sold a house to my grandparents.
[00:13:18] And now I'm getting those people.
[00:13:20] And they're like, they said that I can't go with anybody else, but you.
[00:13:23] And they're so sweet because they are like family.
[00:13:26] And I do know tons of family members.
[00:13:28] I don't know like I know the parents, the grandparents, the cousins.
[00:13:31] And then you go into these like families and you just absorb the entire family and they
[00:13:36] become your family.
[00:13:37] It's really sweet.
[00:13:38] I bet you get a lot of invitations to functions and family events and weddings and all sorts
[00:13:44] of things.
[00:13:45] Yes.
[00:13:46] And I try to make them.
[00:13:47] I really do.
[00:13:48] Whenever if I have, if I have a spot in my calendar, I will make time for them because
[00:13:52] it's really sweet to catch up.
[00:13:54] But sometimes I just end to gift because I still want to be a part of their family.
[00:13:59] Yeah.
[00:13:59] I love that.
[00:14:00] And I think that is a life well lived.
[00:14:02] You know, when we talk about, you know, legacy and building a career in real estate, that's
[00:14:07] the dream, right?
[00:14:08] So that for at least almost everybody I've ever met who's a real tear, they want those
[00:14:12] relationships with clients.
[00:14:14] I, the person that I'm purchasing, I just bought a new place from.
[00:14:19] I was asking him, he's been in the business 20 years and he said, I have stood up in three
[00:14:24] people's weddings that I did not know before I started working with them.
[00:14:28] And I was like, wow, that's amazing.
[00:14:30] You know, he goes.
[00:14:31] Yeah, he was like, how cool is that?
[00:14:33] I go, that is very, very cool.
[00:14:35] There is something so special about helping people with not only potentially their largest
[00:14:40] financial purchase, but also, yeah, that most, it's such an emotional experience.
[00:14:45] And it's really, you know, fraught with all sorts of the challenges, right?
[00:14:50] It's, I know, I just, I'm going through it right now, even though my transactions have
[00:14:55] all gone super smoothly, it's still really stressful.
[00:14:57] And I'm an agent.
[00:14:59] And I, I mean, I don't really know what I'm doing, but I'm doing it.
[00:15:02] And I'm going through it as an agent who doesn't know what he's doing.
[00:15:04] And I'm like, oh, my God.
[00:15:05] Now I understand my real tears get paid so much because like I was stressing out the entire
[00:15:10] time.
[00:15:10] I would have to call my friends, go, what do I need to do here?
[00:15:13] What should I do?
[00:15:14] And that's the other thing about the REALTOR community that I'm getting from you is just
[00:15:19] and from your father is generosity.
[00:15:23] You know, you see, you were mentioning helping people like on their closing day.
[00:15:27] Tell me more about generosity and sort of how you implement that in your practice.
[00:15:34] Well, you know how you spoke about your, the other REALTOR that she touches base with
[00:15:39] her clients once a week.
[00:15:41] I spoiled my clients four times a year.
[00:15:44] I wrote for Chris in all of them.
[00:15:45] Like, oh, I said, and I have a closing and I have the secret VIP list.
[00:15:49] But all of them are in the VIP list.
[00:15:51] Like I've never not had someone in the VIP list.
[00:15:54] And for Christmas, I'll send them point set as like I'll hand deliver.
[00:15:58] I have drivers that go and take point set as over to their door or we also do the other
[00:16:05] of the more because I am Latina and I don't celebrate Halloween, but I celebrate the
[00:16:09] other those more of those.
[00:16:10] They have the dad.
[00:16:11] Yes.
[00:16:12] Yeah.
[00:16:12] I will deliver a candle to them and say, Hey, I hope you have an amazing day of the
[00:16:16] most important season.
[00:16:17] Please remember you pass loved ones or else in them pies for Thanksgiving.
[00:16:22] So I really try to spoil them.
[00:16:25] You could have bought a house for me 10 years ago and you're still hearing from me because
[00:16:29] I still care about you because you're still my client.
[00:16:31] You're still my friend.
[00:16:33] Yeah, you have that servant heart.
[00:16:35] I can, I can feel it and hear it coming off of you and that those, those are who make
[00:16:40] the best REALTOR is in my opinion and people who are really kind of meant to serve.
[00:16:45] And I do want to talk about working with Hispanic clients because it is something
[00:16:52] that we don't really tackle on our show very often.
[00:16:55] But if we look at the data, they are the fastest growing people that are buying property
[00:17:01] right now.
[00:17:02] And so it's very important, I think, for all agents, no matter what your ethnicity is,
[00:17:08] to understand the needs of the Latino market and those clients, what they're, how they
[00:17:15] think about purchasing property, maybe their fears, especially right now.
[00:17:20] There's a lot of fear right now with the current administration.
[00:17:23] There's obviously a lot going on there politically.
[00:17:26] And it's just a difficult time, I think, right now.
[00:17:29] And so I would love for you to weigh in on, tell us, you know, what, if I was an agent
[00:17:36] looking to work with more Latino clients, what should I think about?
[00:17:41] What should I know?
[00:17:43] You know, for, in the early 2000s, there was a lot of predatory loans that were done
[00:17:48] towards the Latino community.
[00:17:51] So a lot of people lost their houses because they've had these crazy interest rates that
[00:17:55] they were, they were variable interest rates.
[00:17:57] They got it.
[00:17:58] Yeah, they're interest only loans that would, would change, be a libor or something.
[00:18:02] They would be at like 2%, then they jump up to like 7%, and it was crazy.
[00:18:07] Yeah.
[00:18:07] But the worst part is that they didn't know, they didn't know what they were signing up
[00:18:11] to.
[00:18:11] They thought they were going to have that 2% for 30 years and the house was already paid
[00:18:15] off.
[00:18:16] So I think part of what I've understood with my community is to just be super transparent
[00:18:21] with the loan documents, which is most, you know, I'm not a loan officer, but I get the
[00:18:26] loan documents.
[00:18:27] So the loan documents get emailed to me.
[00:18:29] I print them out and I go over page by page with my clients so that we can see, hey, it's
[00:18:35] a fixed interest rate.
[00:18:36] It's never going to change.
[00:18:37] Nothing is going to happen.
[00:18:38] Let's just be upfront about taxes.
[00:18:41] Let's be upfront about insurance.
[00:18:42] Let's be upfront about everything.
[00:18:43] And I think the more I communicate with them, the more they trust me.
[00:18:48] And once I have their trust, I have them forever and they become mine.
[00:18:54] Yeah.
[00:18:55] I totally agree.
[00:18:57] And I remember the interest only loan days.
[00:19:00] And I remember they were disproportionately Hispanic people were disproportionately affected
[00:19:07] by it because it seemed like a really good idea.
[00:19:09] And let's be honest, nobody really understands how mortgages work.
[00:19:12] I mean, certainly the late people don't.
[00:19:15] And I barely do.
[00:19:16] And I have had mortgages for 20 years.
[00:19:19] And I barely understand it.
[00:19:21] And especially back then when it was interest only, it was so weird.
[00:19:25] And it could jump a certain number of basis points every year.
[00:19:28] But it would get very, it was just a very strange time.
[00:19:31] And a lot of those people did sort of, you know, get unfortunately not well educated on
[00:19:39] it.
[00:19:39] And that was, that's a huge problem.
[00:19:41] And I think to the, the idea of education, right?
[00:19:45] So you probably deal with a lot of first time home buyers.
[00:19:49] So what do you think the most important thing to tell somebody who's renting, you know,
[00:19:55] who maybe doesn't even know that they could purchase?
[00:19:58] You know, how do you start to educate them on, hey, now it's time to take the step to
[00:20:02] become a homeowner?
[00:20:04] Yeah.
[00:20:05] It's funny that you asked me that question yesterday.
[00:20:07] I had a client and I sold her house 2019, 2019, I sell her house.
[00:20:13] She was very uncomfortable with the idea of buying a house.
[00:20:16] She was only doing it because her family told her buy a house.
[00:20:20] She didn't qualify for much.
[00:20:21] She qualified for $160,000.
[00:20:24] We found her a beautiful three bedroom, two bathroom, older house, 1952 house, but it had
[00:20:30] good bones.
[00:20:32] She complained when the taxes went up.
[00:20:35] She complained with insurance when up.
[00:20:37] We, you know, for the five years, I've seen her at least twice a year because we shop
[00:20:42] for insurance or we submitted tax pro-ration so that they could lower her taxes.
[00:20:48] So I've helped her for five years, but she has complained for five years about buying
[00:20:52] this house, right?
[00:20:54] Yeah.
[00:20:55] I said to her, it is, it's your home, your building equity.
[00:20:59] This has been a good move for you.
[00:21:01] Like, you could have been renting and granted.
[00:21:03] You'd taxes wouldn't have gone up or you didn't have to take care of any repairs, but you
[00:21:08] haven't an asset for your children.
[00:21:11] Yesterday, she called me out of the blue and she said, can you fit me in?
[00:21:14] And I'm like, of course, coming in and I was expecting something, something like taxes
[00:21:18] went up, right?
[00:21:19] And I'm like, how are you going to fix it?
[00:21:20] But she said, I had a stroke last month.
[00:21:24] Oh, no.
[00:21:25] I have $40,000 in debt.
[00:21:28] I don't know what to do.
[00:21:29] And I said, you know what?
[00:21:31] This is what your house is for.
[00:21:32] This is what all the sacrifices have been for.
[00:21:36] Her house is now worth $250,000.
[00:21:39] Oh, wow.
[00:21:39] We're going to refinance it.
[00:21:41] We're going to cash her out.
[00:21:42] She's going to keep her home.
[00:21:44] She's going to keep a really good payment on it.
[00:21:47] And she's going to eliminate all of her debt.
[00:21:49] And I'm like, this couldn't have happened if you were renting.
[00:21:52] This is your lifeline.
[00:21:53] This is how you're going.
[00:21:55] And she, I mean, obviously, we started the ReFi process right away.
[00:21:59] And now she's going to be OK.
[00:22:02] That is an incredible story.
[00:22:04] And how fortunate for her that you are in her life.
[00:22:09] And you were able to get her to this place where she had
[00:22:14] this life emergency.
[00:22:15] And we all know life emergencies happen to all of us.
[00:22:18] And she was able to take advantage of the-
[00:22:21] She wanted to sell it.
[00:22:22] So she came to me because she wanted to sell it.
[00:22:25] And I said, if we sell it, where am I going to move you to?
[00:22:28] That's not the answer.
[00:22:29] Like, let's look at that whole picture.
[00:22:31] Like, I'm not going to make a commission out of you
[00:22:33] because you want to sell.
[00:22:34] Is this the right move for you?
[00:22:36] Yes or no?
[00:22:36] No, because then you're going to be homeless.
[00:22:39] Right.
[00:22:40] Yeah.
[00:22:40] You just basically gave her an option.
[00:22:43] She didn't know what was possible.
[00:22:45] Right.
[00:22:46] And she gets to stay in the same house.
[00:22:49] I can't imagine.
[00:22:50] That is going to be a client for life, obviously.
[00:22:53] And she's going to tell a lot of other people,
[00:22:56] you're not going to believe what my-
[00:22:57] And by the way, you're not going to move my REALTOR did for me.
[00:23:00] For free.
[00:23:01] This is not-
[00:23:02] You are not getting paid on this.
[00:23:04] So in addition to being just a good human being,
[00:23:08] you, you know, just being a great REALTOR, I meant to say,
[00:23:12] you are also being a wonderful human being to this person.
[00:23:15] And this is that servant mentality, I think, is-
[00:23:19] And boy, I would imagine you will get many, many referrals
[00:23:23] if you haven't already from just from this one person.
[00:23:26] But what a great story.
[00:23:29] So let's talk about motels because I think this is such a cool thing
[00:23:33] that you were doing.
[00:23:34] Tell us about the problem that you're solving with motels.
[00:23:39] Okay.
[00:23:40] So in Avocurky, we have Route 66.
[00:23:42] We have 22 miles that are all Route 66.
[00:23:45] So it is the longest stretch of Route 66.
[00:23:47] So we have a lot of motels along Route 66.
[00:23:52] Yeah.
[00:23:52] These motels, unfortunately, are not popular anymore.
[00:23:55] Now we have Hilton's and residents in and Marriots.
[00:23:58] And you're not going to go and stay at Route 60,
[00:24:01] at the 1950s motels.
[00:24:02] People don't like to stay at motels, yeah.
[00:24:04] Now, they don't want to stay and they smell like smoke.
[00:24:07] And the bed is dirty.
[00:24:08] And you know, you're just not going to do it.
[00:24:11] So there's a lot of dilapidated motels on Route 66.
[00:24:17] And they are, well, they're a problem.
[00:24:20] They're a problem.
[00:24:21] They're a problem for, you know, there's drugs,
[00:24:22] there's prostitution, there's just bad beings.
[00:24:27] And unfortunately, a lot of them are in my area.
[00:24:30] My site of town is 8, 7, 1 to 1.
[00:24:32] That's where I sell the most.
[00:24:33] That's where I consider my bread and butter.
[00:24:37] And these motels are just not good for my community.
[00:24:41] They, I wouldn't feel safe because of all the crime
[00:24:45] that they bring.
[00:24:47] So a colleague of mine said,
[00:24:54] I don't know, I don't know.
[00:24:56] 
[00:24:56] 
[00:24:56] 
[00:24:56] That sounds a little bit hard.
[00:24:57] And he's like, you're young.
[00:24:58] This could be your 401k.
[00:25:00] I said, you know, I don't know.
[00:25:02] I've never even considered financing a motel.
[00:25:04] They call my god.
[00:25:05] How much does it cost?
[00:25:06] But you know, down payment, he's like,
[00:25:08] you know, I don't worry.
[00:25:08] They're going to do a risky contract, put 10% down.
[00:25:12] And then you can live off of the rent.
[00:25:15] It sounded really easy.
[00:25:16] It sounded amazing.
[00:25:18] I went to see them.
[00:25:19] And he was like, wow, phenomenal.
[00:25:21] It looks great.
[00:25:22] They have kitchen edge.
[00:25:23] They're fine.
[00:25:26] Once I got into them, I realized, you know,
[00:25:29] I needed to update the plumbing.
[00:25:31] The electricity, the H back units.
[00:25:33] I mean, it was a lot more work that I was anticipating.
[00:25:36] But it's so rewarding.
[00:25:38] I have a ton of like veterans.
[00:25:41] I have a lot of catheterities is in there.
[00:25:44] A lot of different organizations that just
[00:25:46] have single people that don't have anywhere to go.
[00:25:49] And they come to me.
[00:25:51] And then I had a wait list on the first one.
[00:25:53] So I said, hey, this is a thing.
[00:25:55] Like people need affordable housing.
[00:25:57] We provide electricity, water, internet.
[00:26:01] We include all the utilities in the rent.
[00:26:03] And we provide a safe environment.
[00:26:07] And that's what we do.
[00:26:09] So we bought one and then a second one and then the third one.
[00:26:13] Wow.
[00:26:14] Have you have you have like the local news picked up on this
[00:26:17] and done stories?
[00:26:18] I imagine they would have.
[00:26:20] You know, they haven't.
[00:26:22] There's a magazine from Colorado that came and did
[00:26:24] a whole article on it.
[00:26:26] But but no, I think I don't know.
[00:26:29] I don't I don't brag about it a lot.
[00:26:31] Yeah.
[00:26:32] I'm just happy that I'm providing for my community.
[00:26:36] What a great story to tell as well.
[00:26:38] And do you anticipate doing more of these?
[00:26:41] So funny story.
[00:26:42] I have another one.
[00:26:43] I have a fourth one.
[00:26:45] And that fourth one is in between like the same zip code,
[00:26:49] but it's in the area.
[00:26:51] And I said, I can't do affordable housing.
[00:26:52] I'm going to saturate the area.
[00:26:54] All three of them are rented out.
[00:26:56] Let's do something fun for the community.
[00:26:58] So I am turning that one into a shopping center.
[00:27:01] So it's going to be seven restaurants, two bars,
[00:27:05] and Nelson on barbershop, a Paleta bar.
[00:27:09] So obviously Mexican ice cream.
[00:27:11] Yeah.
[00:27:12] So I want somewhere safe for the community to be able to go.
[00:27:16] You think it your nails done?
[00:27:17] The husband can be watching the game.
[00:27:19] And the kids can be getting a nice cream.
[00:27:21] Everyone can be there together.
[00:27:22] I want a safe place for my community to be.
[00:27:25] Wow.
[00:27:26] I think those called third spaces, I believe they're called.
[00:27:29] Or something like the second spaces.
[00:27:30] Or where communities can kind of come together and enjoy.
[00:27:34] And I love that.
[00:27:36] What a wonderful idea.
[00:27:38] Yes, you are.
[00:27:40] You're a REALTOR, but you're really a developer at heart.
[00:27:44] It's been really hard.
[00:27:46] It's been really hard to be a developer.
[00:27:48] There's been a lot of lessons.
[00:27:50] And lessons you don't expect.
[00:27:52] I thought the food hall would be super fast and easy.
[00:27:55] No, I had to put in a fire hydrant.
[00:27:57] And I was like, why do I need to put in a fire hydrant?
[00:28:01] And like, well, you're going to have a lot of people there.
[00:28:03] And you're like, I didn't think about a fire hydrant.
[00:28:05] Like, what are you talking about?
[00:28:06] So it's just been one lesson after another.
[00:28:10] I'm very grateful for them.
[00:28:11] And I'm really, I think what makes me
[00:28:13] happier is knowing that I will be able to provide a place
[00:28:15] for my community to hang out as a family.
[00:28:18] I don't think we have enough of those places.
[00:28:20] I think restaurants, but then there's life.
[00:28:24] You have to get your nails done.
[00:28:25] You have to get your hair done.
[00:28:26] You have to get everything.
[00:28:27] And you want to be able to go out as a family.
[00:28:31] Yeah, in the 70s, there used to be things called community.
[00:28:33] In the 80s, there used to be community centers
[00:28:36] where people would, if there's really young people,
[00:28:38] would go and congregate.
[00:28:40] And they don't really exist anymore.
[00:28:42] And it's really important for people to have spaces
[00:28:46] to hang out.
[00:28:46] And malls are kind of took over that thing.
[00:28:51] But then malls kind of went away.
[00:28:52] And malls aren't as popular as they used to be
[00:28:54] because we're shopping online.
[00:28:56] And so we still have this need to get together.
[00:28:59] And I love that you are developing those things
[00:29:02] in a real positive way for your community.
[00:29:05] And I've always said, you know, well, that's not I've always
[00:29:10] said, I've learned from doing 700 episodes
[00:29:12] that real estate is so hyper local.
[00:29:16] If you can be a value to your local market,
[00:29:19] you will be rewarded with lots of business
[00:29:21] because you are giving to the exact community
[00:29:25] that you are serving.
[00:29:27] And you're not just helping them find homes.
[00:29:29] You're actually actively helping make the area
[00:29:32] more attractive, more safe.
[00:29:34] And certainly more affordable.
[00:29:36] So I really honor you for doing this.
[00:29:39] It must be a lot of fun.
[00:29:41] It's a spite of how challenging I'm sure it is.
[00:29:44] It is super fun.
[00:29:46] I have to tell you, I am impulsive.
[00:29:49] And I see something and I'm like, let's just do it.
[00:29:51] And I'll figure out how, like if I see a good deal,
[00:29:54] I'm like, I won it.
[00:29:56] And God always just puts it together.
[00:29:58] Like I'm like, how am I going to get finance
[00:29:59] if you would have asked me five years ago,
[00:30:01] how do you get four motels under contract?
[00:30:04] And I wouldn't have been able to tell you.
[00:30:06] But the opportunity came and then I figured it out.
[00:30:09] I'm like, you know what, let's do this loan
[00:30:11] or let's, there was just ways.
[00:30:13] It just happened.
[00:30:14] But without my husband supporting me in every way,
[00:30:18] like there's no way I would be here.
[00:30:21] Because I think of the ideas and I jump, but he executes them.
[00:30:25] He's the one that, you know, he does the remodel.
[00:30:28] I mean, he doesn't physically do the remodel
[00:30:30] but he's project manager.
[00:30:31] He's going every day to Home Depot
[00:30:33] and he's going every day to take up on the workers
[00:30:35] and he's making sure that the work was done right.
[00:30:37] And he's pulling her mates in me
[00:30:39] and just I think about it, but I don't do it.
[00:30:42] Well, and now you are an investor.
[00:30:45] Now you are somebody who is investing into your community.
[00:30:50] And I think that, and you know, it's where you live.
[00:30:53] It's where you work.
[00:30:54] I think that is just such a powerful message
[00:30:57] for agents to really think about
[00:30:59] how do I become more visible in my community?
[00:31:02] Well, you do things like this.
[00:31:04] And these are big swings.
[00:31:05] You're taking a big swing and you've done it.
[00:31:08] And obviously not everyone can take those big swings,
[00:31:10] but you can take small swings as well.
[00:31:13] You know, you can become valuable
[00:31:15] and be of service to an organization within your community.
[00:31:20] You can volunteer.
[00:31:21] You can give back in lots of different ways.
[00:31:23] But I've always thought that that would be
[00:31:26] really the most rewarding part of being an agent
[00:31:29] is to sort of how do I beautify my community?
[00:31:33] How do I make it a more enjoyable place to live?
[00:31:37] Let's just go back into sort of client care.
[00:31:40] So you said four times a year,
[00:31:42] you're delivering, you know,
[00:31:43] spoiling your clients, giving them items of value, gifts,
[00:31:46] et cetera.
[00:31:48] How do you, you know, what percentage of your business
[00:31:51] right now is is referral?
[00:31:53] I'm curious.
[00:31:54] 100%.
[00:31:55] I don't do any Zillow leads.
[00:31:57] I don't do anything.
[00:31:57] It's all referrals.
[00:31:59] And how many homes do you think you'll sell
[00:32:01] in the next 12 months?
[00:32:02] What do you think?
[00:32:03] You to date, I'm at 89.
[00:32:06] Unbelievable.
[00:32:07] So you, that is unbelievable.
[00:32:11] And that does not happen overnight, obviously.
[00:32:13] So what do you think, and you've seen agents come and go?
[00:32:17] You've seen agents succeed, some not succeed.
[00:32:20] And you obviously got great lessons from your father.
[00:32:24] What do you think is treating them like family,
[00:32:26] of course, you'd mentioned earlier,
[00:32:28] but what do you think are some of the other things you're doing
[00:32:30] that really, really add value so that you get 89 people
[00:32:34] calling you or maybe you're calling them saying,
[00:32:37] I want to work with you.
[00:32:39] Yeah, my phone rings.
[00:32:40] And this is why I'm telling you,
[00:32:42] if you do a good job, if you do an honest work,
[00:32:45] people will come to you, people will refer you.
[00:32:47] I don't, it's funny.
[00:32:49] All the trainings are like, oh, if you want these many appointments,
[00:32:51] you have to make these many phone calls.
[00:32:53] I have never had to do that.
[00:32:55] You don't make phone calls.
[00:32:56] No, no, no, no, no.
[00:32:59] No, the phone calls come to me and it's like,
[00:33:01] hey, you were referred by my cousin.
[00:33:02] Hey, and I'm like, oh, has your cousin doing it?
[00:33:04] And then I'll send that cousin a $25 gift card.
[00:33:07] Hope everything's doing great.
[00:33:08] I miss you.
[00:33:09] Let's have coffee soon.
[00:33:10] I just have to keep up with my database.
[00:33:13] I love that.
[00:33:14] I love that.
[00:33:15] So that is, that is really amazing.
[00:33:18] And that, imagine, I imagine a lot of our listeners
[00:33:22] are thinking, oh, my gosh, 90 homes in a year,
[00:33:26] where that basically answering the phone.
[00:33:29] And again, it's not magic.
[00:33:31] She didn't happen to her.
[00:33:33] She built this community of a self-sustaining community
[00:33:37] through incredible hard work.
[00:33:41] That's what people don't see, right?
[00:33:43] And you probably do a lot of things for free as well,
[00:33:48] along the way.
[00:33:49] And then that obviously rewards you
[00:33:52] when the time is needed for a REALTOR.
[00:33:55] But it is just give, give, give, give.
[00:33:58] And one day you receive as well.
[00:34:01] I love that.
[00:34:02] If you were a new agent starting out,
[00:34:06] what would you tell them to do to get started?
[00:34:08] So if somebody's listening here who doesn't have
[00:34:11] this big community, but once what you have,
[00:34:14] what would you suggest for them to start doing?
[00:34:17] Number one, I would reach out to everybody
[00:34:20] in your database because you do have a database.
[00:34:22] You would first create a database, right?
[00:34:25] That your mom and dad practice a mom and dad,
[00:34:29] but create a database, your friends, your colleagues,
[00:34:32] anyone that you know, put them in a database,
[00:34:34] send them a calendar, pick up the phone,
[00:34:36] and tell them, hey, I am a REALTOR,
[00:34:38] I am doing this now.
[00:34:40] Do you have anyone that's interested in purchasing a house?
[00:34:43] Is there, or even just get a neighborhood
[00:34:46] and send in CMAs, you know, just get your name out there,
[00:34:50] just doorknogging anything just to start getting out there
[00:34:53] and getting practice because you are gonna mess up,
[00:34:55] you are gonna have bad scripts,
[00:34:57] but the more you do it, the more natural it is.
[00:35:00] It was crazy.
[00:35:01] So the place I just sold is a new development
[00:35:04] at five years ago, it was built.
[00:35:08] And we've had people sell within that five years.
[00:35:11] It's not a lot of people, but do you know how many
[00:35:14] random CMAs I got from agents?
[00:35:17] And there are 45,000 REALTORS in the Chicago land area.
[00:35:22] I got, maybe, actually, I do think I got one.
[00:35:25] I was gonna say zero, but I think I actually did get one
[00:35:27] from an agent a couple of years ago,
[00:35:29] and I was like, oh my God, literally one.
[00:35:32] And I was like, anybody, and again, maybe they knew
[00:35:35] I'm a REALTOR, so they didn't send it to me,
[00:35:38] but I asked my neighbors, they didn't get them either.
[00:35:40] And unless it was from their own agent,
[00:35:43] but I mean, like what an opportunity, right?
[00:35:46] To reach out to somebody in an area and say,
[00:35:50] hey, I wanna give you a new update evaluation
[00:35:53] on your property.
[00:35:55] Like it's easy to do, it costs almost nothing,
[00:35:57] other than time, and maybe the price of a stamp.
[00:36:03] And it's valuable, it's important to people.
[00:36:06] And everybody's checking their zestiment anyway,
[00:36:07] so you might as well throw your hat in the ring
[00:36:10] and say, hey, I think the zestiment might be a little off.
[00:36:12] I've got a better predictor, and I wanna give you
[00:36:16] through my experience.
[00:36:17] So I think that is such a great idea.
[00:36:20] It's like, it's so obvious, and I mean, nobody does it.
[00:36:25] It's crazy to me.
[00:36:26] People used to do it.
[00:36:28] I remember years ago, when I was 10 years ago,
[00:36:31] I would get things in the mail.
[00:36:33] Occasionally, I don't get anything in the mail anymore.
[00:36:36] It's amazing.
[00:36:37] So I think the sort of the field is wide open
[00:36:42] for agents to take advantage of this.
[00:36:44] And like you said, give them something of value.
[00:36:49] Yeah.
[00:36:51] My kiddos hate going to Walmart with me,
[00:36:53] because if I go to Walmart and I'm like,
[00:36:55] I'm just running in, I'm getting milk.
[00:36:56] That's it.
[00:36:57] In out in their like, mom, you're gonna run into like 20 people.
[00:37:01] You're gonna talk to everyone, and it's gonna take.
[00:37:04] It's gonna go from 10 minutes to 45 minute trip.
[00:37:07] So now my kids are like, no, no, no, no, just give us the card.
[00:37:09] We'll go buy it.
[00:37:10] You stay in the card.
[00:37:13] I'm like, okay, guys, okay, fine.
[00:37:15] I'll stay in the card.
[00:37:17] Yeah.
[00:37:18] You have made yourself invaluable to that community.
[00:37:22] And yeah, going out in public,
[00:37:23] you probably just see lots of your work, your past work,
[00:37:28] as you're going through, and you see these wonderful clients
[00:37:30] and just basically spreading joy throughout.
[00:37:35] And then I follow them on Instagram, right?
[00:37:37] So then I know like, I'm like, oh, they just had a baby.
[00:37:39] And I'll be like, girls, let's send them a gift card to Amazon
[00:37:42] or less than the baby basket.
[00:37:43] Or, you know, I will.
[00:37:44] Like if you post something that I need to know about,
[00:37:46] I will send you a gift card.
[00:37:48] I'll be like, hey, congratulations.
[00:37:50] Hey, let's do this.
[00:37:51] Like, yeah, totally.
[00:37:52] I will always spoil you.
[00:37:54] What I noticed most about you, and again, this is a mindset thing,
[00:37:58] I think, but I think it's really important.
[00:38:01] You have a lot of fun with your job.
[00:38:03] Oh, I love my job.
[00:38:04] I love it.
[00:38:05] My husband is going to Dallas today.
[00:38:07] He's a clean up.
[00:38:08] Please just come with me.
[00:38:09] And I'm saying, I am so looking forward to you not being here.
[00:38:13] And me just working for four days without having to worry
[00:38:17] about dinner or anything.
[00:38:19] I'm like, I just want to work.
[00:38:20] I just want to be with my people.
[00:38:21] I just want to be having fun.
[00:38:23] Because yes, maybe I have so much fun in my job.
[00:38:27] You know, and it's infectious.
[00:38:29] I mean, I'm like in a better mood, just speaking with you.
[00:38:33] And I always think if you can have this much fun at work,
[00:38:38] and I interview people, and not that it's not hard,
[00:38:41] of course it's hard.
[00:38:42] Everything in life is hard.
[00:38:44] So the hard part is built in.
[00:38:46] But if you can have fun while it's hard,
[00:38:49] it makes it just really enjoyable.
[00:38:52] And I really get that from you.
[00:38:54] And I think, you know, boy, it must be fun to work next to you.
[00:38:59] Because it's stressful, but it is fun.
[00:39:02] If you open my calendar tomorrow, I know because my husband's
[00:39:05] gone.
[00:39:06] And when my mom lives next door to me,
[00:39:08] so it's really easy.
[00:39:09] The kids know that they have a home cooked meal at my mom's
[00:39:12] house.
[00:39:12] And I work.
[00:39:13] We have this routine that when my husband's at a town,
[00:39:15] I can work until eight or nine p.m.
[00:39:18] And I know tomorrow, my day starts at 8 a.m.
[00:39:20] And it ends at nine p.m.
[00:39:22] Most people would be like, oh man, that's a really long day
[00:39:25] to me.
[00:39:26] I am seeing some of my favorite clients tomorrow.
[00:39:28] I am so thrilled.
[00:39:29] I'm like, yes, I go from one appointment to another.
[00:39:32] And they're all amazing people.
[00:39:34] It's exciting.
[00:39:35] You're hanging out with your friends.
[00:39:37] Is essentially what you're doing.
[00:39:38] Yes.
[00:39:39] I mean, how fortunate is you get to spend time?
[00:39:43] If you build your business correctly,
[00:39:45] you get to spend time with your friends all every day.
[00:39:48] Like, that's pretty cool if you think about it.
[00:39:51] Yes.
[00:39:52] And there are a lot of professions that
[00:39:53] have this financial advisors have it, maybe accountants.
[00:39:57] But there's something special about the REALTOR
[00:39:59] and the home purchase.
[00:40:01] There's something super emotional that maybe the financial advisor
[00:40:04] doesn't quite get or the insurance agent or the account.
[00:40:08] But that is something that I think if we really lean into that
[00:40:13] and you have leaned into that heavy,
[00:40:16] that it really pays back and rewards you.
[00:40:19] And you don't worry about marketing.
[00:40:21] You don't market.
[00:40:22] You just go, I'm just going to be there for all of these people.
[00:40:26] I care about them.
[00:40:27] I know what's going on in their lives.
[00:40:28] I pay attention on social media to what they're doing.
[00:40:31] I send them things to let them know
[00:40:34] that I am paying attention.
[00:40:35] I see you.
[00:40:36] I hear you.
[00:40:37] I know you're doing this thing.
[00:40:38] By the way, how good does it feel when somebody contacts us
[00:40:41] and goes, I saw you just did that cool thing
[00:40:43] or you went on that vacation.
[00:40:44] And we all want to be seen and heard.
[00:40:47] And I know that sounds kind of like so obvious.
[00:40:50] It's not that obvious to people.
[00:40:51] If you can make people feel seen and heard and appreciated
[00:40:55] and cared for, which is, I would say that is your brand
[00:41:00] is people feel cared for when they work with Karina.
[00:41:04] And I just think, boy, you're going to have clients for life.
[00:41:09] God willing, God willing because they are,
[00:41:12] they're my friends.
[00:41:13] They are amazing.
[00:41:14] And I'm so grateful for them.
[00:41:16] Wonderful.
[00:41:17] Well, Karina, I am so grateful for you.
[00:41:19] So you came on our show.
[00:41:20] You braved a broken bone to get here.
[00:41:24] You are still smiling and laughing and having a great time.
[00:41:29] And I know life is not super easy with all the transactions
[00:41:32] you do, being a mom, running a business,
[00:41:36] and being on the show.
[00:41:37] So we honor you.
[00:41:38] And not only did Karina break a bone,
[00:41:41] then I had to reschedule this thing.
[00:41:43] So she has been super, super just generous to me
[00:41:47] and my time and for our audience.
[00:41:49] So you're infectious.
[00:41:51] You're so much fun.
[00:41:52] And I hope our audience gets the idea of your attitude.
[00:41:56] I think the attitude of what you do is really,
[00:41:59] really something that our listeners can take away
[00:42:01] is have fun with this job, treat people with kindness
[00:42:05] and care and respect.
[00:42:06] Remember how hard it is for them to,
[00:42:09] I'm going through it right now.
[00:42:10] And boy, it's, there's always like all these extra expenses
[00:42:14] that you didn't think about.
[00:42:15] And I mean, the business.
[00:42:17] And I'm like, oh my God,
[00:42:18] there's all these extra expenses that I didn't even know about.
[00:42:22] And I'm like, oh, it's so stressful.
[00:42:23] So remember that as people are going through
[00:42:26] especially first time home buyers,
[00:42:27] and think about how to meet those needs
[00:42:29] and how to make sure that they know what's coming up
[00:42:32] and care for them like Karina and her father have done.
[00:42:36] And you will build an amazing career.
[00:42:38] And you will eventually have 90 homes a year
[00:42:42] from people just calling you.
[00:42:44] And again, I love that your marketing spend is zero.
[00:42:47] I think that says everything right there.
[00:42:49] My marketing spend is zero.
[00:42:51] And I, well, it's not really zero
[00:42:54] because you're of course giving away gifts and stuff,
[00:42:56] but you are not actively going out looking for business.
[00:42:59] So it is zero, I guess.
[00:43:01] Your client appreciation obviously has a budget to it.
[00:43:06] But your marketing spend is zero.
[00:43:09] And that is, I can't even think of another
[00:43:14] a way to say how incredible of a business that must be.
[00:43:21] So well done.
[00:43:23] And we are so happy for you.
[00:43:26] And again, all of our listeners,
[00:43:28] this is what you want in your business.
[00:43:30] If you want this kind of relationship with your clients,
[00:43:32] this can happen.
[00:43:33] This is possible.
[00:43:34] And then you can go out and be a developer
[00:43:36] and convert motels into visible spaces
[00:43:39] for affordable housing.
[00:43:40] You could do really cool fun things
[00:43:42] if you take care of your people and your community.
[00:43:45] So Karina, thank you so much for being on the podcast.
[00:43:48] I want everybody to follow Karina on Instagram.

And now onto our show. Today's episode is brought to you by Corded.io. Are you looking for agents to join your brokerage team? Now, as a real estate recruiter, I can tell you the answer is always yes. But most agents aren't looking to move right now. So how do you know who to contact? Well, what if I were to tell you there's a recruiting and retention tool powered by artificial intelligence that shows you exactly which agents in your local market are looking to leave their brokerage right now and which agents at your own firm are also looking to leave you? Now, I've been recruiting REALTORS for 15 years and I've hired over 2,000 agents. I can tell you with no exaggeration, this is the tool I've been waiting for. Corded.io looks for trends across dozens of variables for each agent in your market and shows you which agents they believe are likely to move. Not only does it do that, but Corded.io went and visited my recruiting website and read everything I offer. So now when I'm recruiting, Corded's AI tells me exactly what to say based on that agent's needs and what my brokerage can offer. It even writes emails for me. I've never seen anything like it and I use it every single day. Now, if you are looking to grow your brokerage, Corded.io is the best tool out there. Visit Corded.io to schedule a demo again. That's Corded.io. And now, onto the show. Hello and welcome to another episode of Keeping It Real, the largest podcast made by real estate agents and four real estate agents. My name is DJ Paris. I am your guide and host through the show. And just a moment, we're going to be speaking with top producer Karina Chavez. Before we get to Karina, actually, before I even go forward, I have to tell you I made a horrible mistake. And when I introduced Karina because normally what I do before the podcast, of course, I by prepare, I have all of my notes in front of me. And I had forgotten to grab her Instagram. And so I just assumed, well, there's probably only one Karina Chavez in real estate, which I don't know why I thought that. But there was more than one Karina real estate, Karina Chavez. And I pulled up the wrong one, somebody from Southern California and I didn't notice it. And when I introduced her, when I introduced her, you'll hear I introduced her as a 20th Century 21 agent. And that is not her. She is a Keller Williams agent. And I give the wrong Instagram account. I correct it at the very end. But the, you know, I made a mistake at the beginning. So for all of you and you should want to follow Karina because she's doing some really amazing things with development. You'll hear that here in a moment. But please follow her on Instagram. That is Chavez team REALTORS on Instagram. Chavez team REALTORS, my apologies to Karina. She's amazing. And really her story is going to touch you because as you're listening to it, realize that this is the kind of business you want to build. She is so amazing. She's so infectious. You're going to love her. And I also want to tell you, I have a tool for you that I want you to use as the listener. I built this for you. I actually used it myself to help sell my condo. I created a listing rewriter and not just taking your listing and throwing it in chat GPT. I actually, I'm doing that, but I'm actually having it go through six different rounds of rewrites. I'm also looking for all of the amenities in the area that you might not have thought about. We're going to add those in and even things inside the home that we're going to do with some research for and find that you might have missed. So I want you to try it out. It's totally free. It's my gift to you. It's listing. Join kale.com listing. Join kale.com. You just put in a current listing you have put in your, your listing description and a few just basic facts about the property, the address and bedrooms and bath and just a couple of things. Takes 20 seconds. Hit that button. Wait about a minute and it will see we create three different listing descriptions for you. All three are amazing. We also email it to you. Again, this is my way of saying thank you for being a dedicated, keeping it real listener. Please share this with a friend. You can share this link also with other REALTORS. Have them test it and let me know what you think. Does it help you? I just send it to one of the very top producers here in Chicago and she said, oh my gosh, this is better than I could write for her own listing descriptions and she does over 200 million herself every single year. So give it a shot listing. Join kale.com. Let me know how it works for you and let's get on to my conversation with Karina Shavez. Best advice has been always answered your phone. I think a lot of people take that for granted and it's such an easy one. It's something we should all be doing at all times. But I make it my priority. If we all have a life, we all have meetings, we all have things to do. But I make it a priority to at the end of the day, just go through all the missed phone calls, all the missed text messages and answer each and every one of them because you never know what you're going to get. It's a great one. I love now too with the technology as evolved at least on my iPhone. I don't know if Android users, I'm sure they have this as well. But now when people are leaving messages, you get to see the transcription in real time and you could interrupt and you can literally pick up like you used to be able to do with answering machines. So I love that that's the possibility now. So even if you don't answer it right away, you could pick it up mid sentence and be like, oh, I'm here. I'm here. Yes, yes, yes. You know, it's funny. I asked one of the top REALTORS here in Chicago and I mean, does 200 million dollars a year or herself and why she's so successful? And she didn't say I answered the phone, but she said something basically akin to that. She says, I call every one of my clients every week and I said, and she goes, no, that's it. I said, what do you mean? She says, I call every client I have every week and give them an update on what's going on. And I said, and I was like, there's got to be more to it. But she goes, well, there is more to it. But she goes, that is the consistency. So picking up your phone, doing those things, we take it for granted that everybody has those practices, but obviously everybody doesn't. Okay, worst piece of advice you've received in real estate. I think the worst piece of advice has been not to go on social media, not to adapt to changes. You know, it's like it's just like, you know, who has time for social media? It was time for TikTok or Instagram. And I'm like, it's the new way. It's a new way. I think it changes inevitable. I feel like in my industry in real estate, everything is constantly changing and it's either get on the boat or get lost. That's just the way it works. Yeah, I agree. I am not particularly strong on social media. Our podcast isn't particularly strong on social media. And this next year, I think we're going to have to hire somebody to help me with that because I don't spend much time on social media myself. And I'm missing out on a lot of opportunity to engage with our audience. But Karina Chavez is our guest today. I am so excited. And Karina is a real trooper. She actually fractured a bone on the day that we were going to record initially. And she is here now and we are, we honor her. She is with Century 21 All Stars in Albuquerque and is a total superstar. I really just want to tell you, I'm so sorry. I'm sorry, I can't tell everyone my apologies. Keller Williams in Albuquerque. And Karina Chavez, she's a real estate professional based in Albuquerque who specializes in helping investors and also first time home buyers. She built her brand around authenticity, community, and education, specifically educating clients so that they feel empowered in every step of the journey. Her work blends market knowledge with heart because buying a home is emotional as much as it is financial. I know this. I am doing this right now. I'm selling a home and buying a home and giving up that wonderful 3% loan that I no longer will have. But that is very emotional too. Karina's work blends market knowledge with heart. Oh, I'm sorry. She's known for her energetic Instagram presence, which by the way, we're going to promote her Instagram in just a moment where she shares real estate tips behind the scene stories and her life as a mom. She loves connecting with people, finding opportunities others might miss and creating experiences that make clients feel supported. She is doing something very cool on the development side. We're going to talk about in just a moment. Real estate is not just Karina's career. It is her calling over the last five years. She has dedicated a lot of her time into purchasing 1950s motels and converting them into affordable housing. How cool is that follow Karina on Instagram at Karinita sells social. I will have a link to that in the show notes. And so you don't have to worry about spelling it. Just go to the show notes. Click on it. Follow her. She has wonderful social media. Karina, welcome. Ahisam, thank you so much. That was a great introduction. You're amazing. Well, I will tell you my team. My team writes that for me thing goodness. And I will tell you I even screwed up on one of the so I apologize there, but you have done so many things. And I am really impressed with your ability to just try different avenues within real estate. And let's start at the beginning. Why real estate? How did you get in? You know what it has to do. Everything with my dad, everything I know comes from my dad. My dad has been or was it REALTOR for, you know, even in Mexico, he was a REALTOR. So I was born and raised in Guadalajara, Mexico. And in Guadalajara, he was a REALTOR and we moved here in 1984 and he's like, I am going to keep doing what I do. And I started helping my father because times were changing. You know, back in the day, you used to make an offer and send a fax. They're like, hey, check your fax machine. Make sure you didn't get any offers. And then it was email and dad had a hard time adapting to it. So I started helping him out and slowly we just merged and we worked together for 14 years every day side by side. It was amazing working with my dad. You passed away last year. So I am now, it's personal. Now I really want to honor his memory and make it amazing. Well, that's a wonderful story by my condolences to your loss. And obviously you had a special bond with your father. There's something about daughters and fathers. There's a special bond there. And the fact that you got to work with him and share your passions is really what a blessing. So to continue on in his legacy. So I love that. What a heartwarming story. And so tell us a little bit about getting into the business. Now you're kind of running, running things yourself now. But let's start at the start. What did you learn from your dad? Because obviously he was successful. Your top 1% producer. What were some of the things that you saw him do with his clients that really impacted you? He treated them like human beings. He treated them like he was in their shoes. Like he always acted in their best interest. And closing day, if they struggled or if they had any issues with appliances, my dad would give them a refrigerator. He's like, you know what? Like, this is what I want for my people. Like, you're not going to do everything. You've got to the finish line. Let me take over the rest. Like my dad was just amazing. He treated you like you were family. And it was really cute because now I have like grandchildren. You know, like they're like, hey, your dad sold a house to my grandparents. And now I'm getting those people. And they're like, they said that I can't go with anybody else, but you. And they're so sweet because they are like family. And I do know tons of family members. I don't know like I know the parents, the grandparents, the cousins. And then you go into these like families and you just absorb the entire family and they become your family. It's really sweet. I bet you get a lot of invitations to functions and family events and weddings and all sorts of things. Yes. And I try to make them. I really do. Whenever if I have, if I have a spot in my calendar, I will make time for them because it's really sweet to catch up. But sometimes I just end to gift because I still want to be a part of their family. Yeah. I love that. And I think that is a life well lived. You know, when we talk about, you know, legacy and building a career in real estate, that's the dream, right? So that for at least almost everybody I've ever met who's a real tear, they want those relationships with clients. I, the person that I'm purchasing, I just bought a new place from. I was asking him, he's been in the business 20 years and he said, I have stood up in three people's weddings that I did not know before I started working with them. And I was like, wow, that's amazing. You know, he goes. Yeah, he was like, how cool is that? I go, that is very, very cool. There is something so special about helping people with not only potentially their largest financial purchase, but also, yeah, that most, it's such an emotional experience. And it's really, you know, fraught with all sorts of the challenges, right? It's, I know, I just, I'm going through it right now, even though my transactions have all gone super smoothly, it's still really stressful. And I'm an agent. And I, I mean, I don't really know what I'm doing, but I'm doing it. And I'm going through it as an agent who doesn't know what he's doing. And I'm like, oh, my God. Now I understand my real tears get paid so much because like I was stressing out the entire time. I would have to call my friends, go, what do I need to do here? What should I do? And that's the other thing about the REALTOR community that I'm getting from you is just and from your father is generosity. You know, you see, you were mentioning helping people like on their closing day. Tell me more about generosity and sort of how you implement that in your practice. Well, you know how you spoke about your, the other REALTOR that she touches base with her clients once a week. I spoiled my clients four times a year. I wrote for Chris in all of them. Like, oh, I said, and I have a closing and I have the secret VIP list. But all of them are in the VIP list. Like I've never not had someone in the VIP list. And for Christmas, I'll send them point set as like I'll hand deliver. I have drivers that go and take point set as over to their door or we also do the other of the more because I am Latina and I don't celebrate Halloween, but I celebrate the other those more of those. They have the dad. Yes. Yeah. I will deliver a candle to them and say, Hey, I hope you have an amazing day of the most important season. Please remember you pass loved ones or else in them pies for Thanksgiving. So I really try to spoil them. You could have bought a house for me 10 years ago and you're still hearing from me because I still care about you because you're still my client. You're still my friend. Yeah, you have that servant heart. I can, I can feel it and hear it coming off of you and that those, those are who make the best REALTOR is in my opinion and people who are really kind of meant to serve. And I do want to talk about working with Hispanic clients because it is something that we don't really tackle on our show very often. But if we look at the data, they are the fastest growing people that are buying property right now. And so it's very important, I think, for all agents, no matter what your ethnicity is, to understand the needs of the Latino market and those clients, what they're, how they think about purchasing property, maybe their fears, especially right now. There's a lot of fear right now with the current administration. There's obviously a lot going on there politically. And it's just a difficult time, I think, right now. And so I would love for you to weigh in on, tell us, you know, what, if I was an agent looking to work with more Latino clients, what should I think about? What should I know? You know, for, in the early 2000s, there was a lot of predatory loans that were done towards the Latino community. So a lot of people lost their houses because they've had these crazy interest rates that they were, they were variable interest rates. They got it. Yeah, they're interest only loans that would, would change, be a libor or something. They would be at like 2%, then they jump up to like 7%, and it was crazy. Yeah. But the worst part is that they didn't know, they didn't know what they were signing up to. They thought they were going to have that 2% for 30 years and the house was already paid off. So I think part of what I've understood with my community is to just be super transparent with the loan documents, which is most, you know, I'm not a loan officer, but I get the loan documents. So the loan documents get emailed to me. I print them out and I go over page by page with my clients so that we can see, hey, it's a fixed interest rate. It's never going to change. Nothing is going to happen. Let's just be upfront about taxes. Let's be upfront about insurance. Let's be upfront about everything. And I think the more I communicate with them, the more they trust me. And once I have their trust, I have them forever and they become mine. Yeah. I totally agree. And I remember the interest only loan days. And I remember they were disproportionately Hispanic people were disproportionately affected by it because it seemed like a really good idea. And let's be honest, nobody really understands how mortgages work. I mean, certainly the late people don't. And I barely do. And I have had mortgages for 20 years. And I barely understand it. And especially back then when it was interest only, it was so weird. And it could jump a certain number of basis points every year. But it would get very, it was just a very strange time. And a lot of those people did sort of, you know, get unfortunately not well educated on it. And that was, that's a huge problem. And I think to the, the idea of education, right? So you probably deal with a lot of first time home buyers. So what do you think the most important thing to tell somebody who's renting, you know, who maybe doesn't even know that they could purchase? You know, how do you start to educate them on, hey, now it's time to take the step to become a homeowner? Yeah. It's funny that you asked me that question yesterday. I had a client and I sold her house 2019, 2019, I sell her house. She was very uncomfortable with the idea of buying a house. She was only doing it because her family told her buy a house. She didn't qualify for much. She qualified for $160,000. We found her a beautiful three bedroom, two bathroom, older house, 1952 house, but it had good bones. She complained when the taxes went up. She complained with insurance when up. We, you know, for the five years, I've seen her at least twice a year because we shop for insurance or we submitted tax pro-ration so that they could lower her taxes. So I've helped her for five years, but she has complained for five years about buying this house, right? Yeah. I said to her, it is, it's your home, your building equity. This has been a good move for you. Like, you could have been renting and granted. You'd taxes wouldn't have gone up or you didn't have to take care of any repairs, but you haven't an asset for your children. Yesterday, she called me out of the blue and she said, can you fit me in? And I'm like, of course, coming in and I was expecting something, something like taxes went up, right? And I'm like, how are you going to fix it? But she said, I had a stroke last month. Oh, no. I have $40,000 in debt. I don't know what to do. And I said, you know what? This is what your house is for. This is what all the sacrifices have been for. Her house is now worth $250,000. Oh, wow. We're going to refinance it. We're going to cash her out. She's going to keep her home. She's going to keep a really good payment on it. And she's going to eliminate all of her debt. And I'm like, this couldn't have happened if you were renting. This is your lifeline. This is how you're going. And she, I mean, obviously, we started the ReFi process right away. And now she's going to be OK. That is an incredible story. And how fortunate for her that you are in her life. And you were able to get her to this place where she had this life emergency. And we all know life emergencies happen to all of us. And she was able to take advantage of the- She wanted to sell it. So she came to me because she wanted to sell it. And I said, if we sell it, where am I going to move you to? That's not the answer. Like, let's look at that whole picture. Like, I'm not going to make a commission out of you because you want to sell. Is this the right move for you? Yes or no? No, because then you're going to be homeless. Right. Yeah. You just basically gave her an option. She didn't know what was possible. Right. And she gets to stay in the same house. I can't imagine. That is going to be a client for life, obviously. And she's going to tell a lot of other people, you're not going to believe what my- And by the way, you're not going to move my REALTOR did for me. For free. This is not- You are not getting paid on this. So in addition to being just a good human being, you, you know, just being a great REALTOR, I meant to say, you are also being a wonderful human being to this person. And this is that servant mentality, I think, is- And boy, I would imagine you will get many, many referrals if you haven't already from just from this one person. But what a great story. So let's talk about motels because I think this is such a cool thing that you were doing. Tell us about the problem that you're solving with motels. Okay. So in Avocurky, we have Route 66. We have 22 miles that are all Route 66. So it is the longest stretch of Route 66. So we have a lot of motels along Route 66. Yeah. These motels, unfortunately, are not popular anymore. Now we have Hilton's and residents in and Marriots. And you're not going to go and stay at Route 60, at the 1950s motels. People don't like to stay at motels, yeah. Now, they don't want to stay and they smell like smoke. And the bed is dirty. And you know, you're just not going to do it. So there's a lot of dilapidated motels on Route 66. And they are, well, they're a problem. They're a problem. They're a problem for, you know, there's drugs, there's prostitution, there's just bad beings. And unfortunately, a lot of them are in my area. My site of town is 8, 7, 1 to 1. That's where I sell the most. That's where I consider my bread and butter. And these motels are just not good for my community. They, I wouldn't feel safe because of all the crime that they bring. So a colleague of mine said, I don't know, I don't know. That sounds a little bit hard. And he's like, you're young. This could be your 401k. I said, you know, I don't know. I've never even considered financing a motel. They call my god. How much does it cost? But you know, down payment, he's like, you know, I don't worry. They're going to do a risky contract, put 10% down. And then you can live off of the rent. It sounded really easy. It sounded amazing. I went to see them. And he was like, wow, phenomenal. It looks great. They have kitchen edge. They're fine. Once I got into them, I realized, you know, I needed to update the plumbing. The electricity, the H back units. I mean, it was a lot more work that I was anticipating. But it's so rewarding. I have a ton of like veterans. I have a lot of catheterities is in there. A lot of different organizations that just have single people that don't have anywhere to go. And they come to me. And then I had a wait list on the first one. So I said, hey, this is a thing. Like people need affordable housing. We provide electricity, water, internet. We include all the utilities in the rent. And we provide a safe environment. And that's what we do. So we bought one and then a second one and then the third one. Wow. Have you have you have like the local news picked up on this and done stories? I imagine they would have. You know, they haven't. There's a magazine from Colorado that came and did a whole article on it. But but no, I think I don't know. I don't I don't brag about it a lot. Yeah. I'm just happy that I'm providing for my community. What a great story to tell as well. And do you anticipate doing more of these? So funny story. I have another one. I have a fourth one. And that fourth one is in between like the same zip code, but it's in the area. And I said, I can't do affordable housing. I'm going to saturate the area. All three of them are rented out. Let's do something fun for the community. So I am turning that one into a shopping center. So it's going to be seven restaurants, two bars, and Nelson on barbershop, a Paleta bar. So obviously Mexican ice cream. Yeah. So I want somewhere safe for the community to be able to go. You think it your nails done? The husband can be watching the game. And the kids can be getting a nice cream. Everyone can be there together. I want a safe place for my community to be. Wow. I think those called third spaces, I believe they're called. Or something like the second spaces. Or where communities can kind of come together and enjoy. And I love that. What a wonderful idea. Yes, you are. You're a REALTOR, but you're really a developer at heart. It's been really hard. It's been really hard to be a developer. There's been a lot of lessons. And lessons you don't expect. I thought the food hall would be super fast and easy. No, I had to put in a fire hydrant. And I was like, why do I need to put in a fire hydrant? And like, well, you're going to have a lot of people there. And you're like, I didn't think about a fire hydrant. Like, what are you talking about? So it's just been one lesson after another. I'm very grateful for them. And I'm really, I think what makes me happier is knowing that I will be able to provide a place for my community to hang out as a family. I don't think we have enough of those places. I think restaurants, but then there's life. You have to get your nails done. You have to get your hair done. You have to get everything. And you want to be able to go out as a family. Yeah, in the 70s, there used to be things called community. In the 80s, there used to be community centers where people would, if there's really young people, would go and congregate. And they don't really exist anymore. And it's really important for people to have spaces to hang out. And malls are kind of took over that thing. But then malls kind of went away. And malls aren't as popular as they used to be because we're shopping online. And so we still have this need to get together. And I love that you are developing those things in a real positive way for your community. And I've always said, you know, well, that's not I've always said, I've learned from doing 700 episodes that real estate is so hyper local. If you can be a value to your local market, you will be rewarded with lots of business because you are giving to the exact community that you are serving. And you're not just helping them find homes. You're actually actively helping make the area more attractive, more safe. And certainly more affordable. So I really honor you for doing this. It must be a lot of fun. It's a spite of how challenging I'm sure it is. It is super fun. I have to tell you, I am impulsive. And I see something and I'm like, let's just do it. And I'll figure out how, like if I see a good deal, I'm like, I won it. And God always just puts it together. Like I'm like, how am I going to get finance if you would have asked me five years ago, how do you get four motels under contract? And I wouldn't have been able to tell you. But the opportunity came and then I figured it out. I'm like, you know what, let's do this loan or let's, there was just ways. It just happened. But without my husband supporting me in every way, like there's no way I would be here. Because I think of the ideas and I jump, but he executes them. He's the one that, you know, he does the remodel. I mean, he doesn't physically do the remodel but he's project manager. He's going every day to Home Depot and he's going every day to take up on the workers and he's making sure that the work was done right. And he's pulling her mates in me and just I think about it, but I don't do it. Well, and now you are an investor. Now you are somebody who is investing into your community. And I think that, and you know, it's where you live. It's where you work. I think that is just such a powerful message for agents to really think about how do I become more visible in my community? Well, you do things like this. And these are big swings. You're taking a big swing and you've done it. And obviously not everyone can take those big swings, but you can take small swings as well. You know, you can become valuable and be of service to an organization within your community. You can volunteer. You can give back in lots of different ways. But I've always thought that that would be really the most rewarding part of being an agent is to sort of how do I beautify my community? How do I make it a more enjoyable place to live? Let's just go back into sort of client care. So you said four times a year, you're delivering, you know, spoiling your clients, giving them items of value, gifts, et cetera. How do you, you know, what percentage of your business right now is is referral? I'm curious. 100%. I don't do any Zillow leads. I don't do anything. It's all referrals. And how many homes do you think you'll sell in the next 12 months? What do you think? You to date, I'm at 89. Unbelievable. So you, that is unbelievable. And that does not happen overnight, obviously. So what do you think, and you've seen agents come and go? You've seen agents succeed, some not succeed. And you obviously got great lessons from your father. What do you think is treating them like family, of course, you'd mentioned earlier, but what do you think are some of the other things you're doing that really, really add value so that you get 89 people calling you or maybe you're calling them saying, I want to work with you. Yeah, my phone rings. And this is why I'm telling you, if you do a good job, if you do an honest work, people will come to you, people will refer you. I don't, it's funny. All the trainings are like, oh, if you want these many appointments, you have to make these many phone calls. I have never had to do that. You don't make phone calls. No, no, no, no, no. No, the phone calls come to me and it's like, hey, you were referred by my cousin. Hey, and I'm like, oh, has your cousin doing it? And then I'll send that cousin a $25 gift card. Hope everything's doing great. I miss you. Let's have coffee soon. I just have to keep up with my database. I love that. I love that. So that is, that is really amazing. And that, imagine, I imagine a lot of our listeners are thinking, oh, my gosh, 90 homes in a year, where that basically answering the phone. And again, it's not magic. She didn't happen to her. She built this community of a self-sustaining community through incredible hard work. That's what people don't see, right? And you probably do a lot of things for free as well, along the way. And then that obviously rewards you when the time is needed for a REALTOR. But it is just give, give, give, give. And one day you receive as well. I love that. If you were a new agent starting out, what would you tell them to do to get started? So if somebody's listening here who doesn't have this big community, but once what you have, what would you suggest for them to start doing? Number one, I would reach out to everybody in your database because you do have a database. You would first create a database, right? That your mom and dad practice a mom and dad, but create a database, your friends, your colleagues, anyone that you know, put them in a database, send them a calendar, pick up the phone, and tell them, hey, I am a REALTOR, I am doing this now. Do you have anyone that's interested in purchasing a house? Is there, or even just get a neighborhood and send in CMAs, you know, just get your name out there, just doorknogging anything just to start getting out there and getting practice because you are gonna mess up, you are gonna have bad scripts, but the more you do it, the more natural it is. It was crazy. So the place I just sold is a new development at five years ago, it was built. And we've had people sell within that five years. It's not a lot of people, but do you know how many random CMAs I got from agents? And there are 45,000 REALTORS in the Chicago land area. I got, maybe, actually, I do think I got one. I was gonna say zero, but I think I actually did get one from an agent a couple of years ago, and I was like, oh my God, literally one. And I was like, anybody, and again, maybe they knew I'm a REALTOR, so they didn't send it to me, but I asked my neighbors, they didn't get them either. And unless it was from their own agent, but I mean, like what an opportunity, right? To reach out to somebody in an area and say, hey, I wanna give you a new update evaluation on your property. Like it's easy to do, it costs almost nothing, other than time, and maybe the price of a stamp. And it's valuable, it's important to people. And everybody's checking their zestiment anyway, so you might as well throw your hat in the ring and say, hey, I think the zestiment might be a little off. I've got a better predictor, and I wanna give you through my experience. So I think that is such a great idea. It's like, it's so obvious, and I mean, nobody does it. It's crazy to me. People used to do it. I remember years ago, when I was 10 years ago, I would get things in the mail. Occasionally, I don't get anything in the mail anymore. It's amazing. So I think the sort of the field is wide open for agents to take advantage of this. And like you said, give them something of value. Yeah. My kiddos hate going to Walmart with me, because if I go to Walmart and I'm like, I'm just running in, I'm getting milk. That's it. In out in their like, mom, you're gonna run into like 20 people. You're gonna talk to everyone, and it's gonna take. It's gonna go from 10 minutes to 45 minute trip. So now my kids are like, no, no, no, no, just give us the card. We'll go buy it. You stay in the card. I'm like, okay, guys, okay, fine. I'll stay in the card. Yeah. You have made yourself invaluable to that community. And yeah, going out in public, you probably just see lots of your work, your past work, as you're going through, and you see these wonderful clients and just basically spreading joy throughout. And then I follow them on Instagram, right? So then I know like, I'm like, oh, they just had a baby. And I'll be like, girls, let's send them a gift card to Amazon or less than the baby basket. Or, you know, I will. Like if you post something that I need to know about, I will send you a gift card. I'll be like, hey, congratulations. Hey, let's do this. Like, yeah, totally. I will always spoil you. What I noticed most about you, and again, this is a mindset thing, I think, but I think it's really important. You have a lot of fun with your job. Oh, I love my job. I love it. My husband is going to Dallas today. He's a clean up. Please just come with me. And I'm saying, I am so looking forward to you not being here. And me just working for four days without having to worry about dinner or anything. I'm like, I just want to work. I just want to be with my people. I just want to be having fun. Because yes, maybe I have so much fun in my job. You know, and it's infectious. I mean, I'm like in a better mood, just speaking with you. And I always think if you can have this much fun at work, and I interview people, and not that it's not hard, of course it's hard. Everything in life is hard. So the hard part is built in. But if you can have fun while it's hard, it makes it just really enjoyable. And I really get that from you. And I think, you know, boy, it must be fun to work next to you. Because it's stressful, but it is fun. If you open my calendar tomorrow, I know because my husband's gone. And when my mom lives next door to me, so it's really easy. The kids know that they have a home cooked meal at my mom's house. And I work. We have this routine that when my husband's at a town, I can work until eight or nine p.m. And I know tomorrow, my day starts at 8 a.m. And it ends at nine p.m. Most people would be like, oh man, that's a really long day to me. I am seeing some of my favorite clients tomorrow. I am so thrilled. I'm like, yes, I go from one appointment to another. And they're all amazing people. It's exciting. You're hanging out with your friends. Is essentially what you're doing. Yes. I mean, how fortunate is you get to spend time? If you build your business correctly, you get to spend time with your friends all every day. Like, that's pretty cool if you think about it. Yes. And there are a lot of professions that have this financial advisors have it, maybe accountants. But there's something special about the REALTOR and the home purchase. There's something super emotional that maybe the financial advisor doesn't quite get or the insurance agent or the account. But that is something that I think if we really lean into that and you have leaned into that heavy, that it really pays back and rewards you. And you don't worry about marketing. You don't market. You just go, I'm just going to be there for all of these people. I care about them. I know what's going on in their lives. I pay attention on social media to what they're doing. I send them things to let them know that I am paying attention. I see you. I hear you. I know you're doing this thing. By the way, how good does it feel when somebody contacts us and goes, I saw you just did that cool thing or you went on that vacation. And we all want to be seen and heard. And I know that sounds kind of like so obvious. It's not that obvious to people. If you can make people feel seen and heard and appreciated and cared for, which is, I would say that is your brand is people feel cared for when they work with Karina. And I just think, boy, you're going to have clients for life. God willing, God willing because they are, they're my friends. They are amazing. And I'm so grateful for them. Wonderful. Well, Karina, I am so grateful for you. So you came on our show. You braved a broken bone to get here. You are still smiling and laughing and having a great time. And I know life is not super easy with all the transactions you do, being a mom, running a business, and being on the show. So we honor you. And not only did Karina break a bone, then I had to reschedule this thing. So she has been super, super just generous to me and my time and for our audience. So you're infectious. You're so much fun. And I hope our audience gets the idea of your attitude. I think the attitude of what you do is really, really something that our listeners can take away is have fun with this job, treat people with kindness and care and respect. Remember how hard it is for them to, I'm going through it right now. And boy, it's, there's always like all these extra expenses that you didn't think about. And I mean, the business. And I'm like, oh my God, there's all these extra expenses that I didn't even know about. And I'm like, oh, it's so stressful. So remember that as people are going through especially first time home buyers, and think about how to meet those needs and how to make sure that they know what's coming up and care for them like Karina and her father have done. And you will build an amazing career. And you will eventually have 90 homes a year from people just calling you. And again, I love that your marketing spend is zero. I think that says everything right there. My marketing spend is zero. And I, well, it's not really zero because you're of course giving away gifts and stuff, but you are not actively going out looking for business. So it is zero, I guess. Your client appreciation obviously has a budget to it. But your marketing spend is zero. And that is, I can't even think of another a way to say how incredible of a business that must be. So well done. And we are so happy for you. And again, all of our listeners, this is what you want in your business. If you want this kind of relationship with your clients, this can happen. This is possible. And then you can go out and be a developer and convert motels into visible spaces for affordable housing. You could do really cool fun things if you take care of your people and your community. So Karina, thank you so much for being on the podcast. I want everybody to follow Karina on Instagram.
