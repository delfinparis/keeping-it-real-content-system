[00:02:45] Today on the show, my guest is Jenny Somerlott with Peterson and Company, which is part
[00:02:50] of Keller Williams-Elk River in Malacca.
[00:02:53] Now let me tell you more about Jen.
[00:02:55] Now, Jenny is a self-proclaimed country girl, a REALTOR specializing in rural real estate
[00:03:01] transactions, involving land splits, acreages, and farms in central rural Minnesota.
[00:03:07] With a proven track record, she closed 24 units in her first year.
[00:03:11] That's incredible.
[00:03:12] 22 in her second year, 30 in her third year, and 40 in her fourth year demonstrating her
[00:03:18] dedication and expertise.
[00:03:20] She takes a relationship-focused approach, serving clients with the same care she would
[00:03:25] extend to family and friends.
[00:03:27] As a busy mom to three boys and a varsity softball coach, Jen understands the value of being
[00:03:33] invested in her community and finding the perfect fit for each family.
[00:03:37] Her personalized no-pressure approach has made her a trusted advisor for those looking
[00:03:41] to buy or sell in Minnesota's rural heartland.
[00:03:44] What everybody to check out Jen at her website, which is Jen.sold in MN.
[00:03:50] Jen.sold in MN.com.
[00:03:53] We'll have a link to that in the show notes.
[00:03:55] And I want you to follow her on Instagram.
[00:03:57] If nothing else, follow her on Instagram.
[00:04:00] Jen, I'm apologize.
[00:04:01] What is your Instagram again?
[00:04:03] Yeah, just at Jen Summerlot.
[00:04:06] At Jen Summerlot.
[00:04:13] We'll have a link to that in the show notes.
[00:04:16] Jen, my apologies.
[00:04:17] I had it in front of me and then I lost it.
[00:04:20] So thanks for coming to my rescue.
[00:04:22] Without further ado, Jen Summerlot, everyone.
[00:04:24] Hi, Jen.
[00:04:25] How are you?
[00:04:26] Good.
[00:04:27] How are you?
[00:04:28] Good.
[00:04:28] I'm really excited to talk to you because I grew up in a smaller city, not as small as where
[00:04:35] you are.
[00:04:36] But I went to school, surrounded by corn fields.
[00:04:40] I'm from Central Illinois.
[00:04:43] And I very much feel more connected to rural, people who live in rural areas than maybe
[00:04:50] even people live in urban environments.
[00:04:51] I live in the city now here in Chicago.
[00:04:53] But we know that there are REALTORS all over, not just the major metropolitan markets.
[00:05:00] And so I'm super excited to chat with you because you've been having incredible success
[00:05:05] for somebody in your first four years there.
[00:05:11] That is an incredible story.
[00:05:13] And I'd love to sort of go back to the beginning and really hear about why you got into real
[00:05:19] estate.
[00:05:19] So tell us how that happened.
[00:05:22] Yeah, so it was something that I've always been interested in.
[00:05:26] Ever since a little girl, I just loved houses and dreaming of what the inside of houses
[00:05:31] looked like.
[00:05:33] But when to college did the stay-at-home mom thing for quite a while.
[00:05:38] And I think it was 2019 when I started my pre-licensing, you know, kind of just as COVID
[00:05:46] was hitting.
[00:05:48] And I thought, you know, why don't I just, I'm stuck at home anyways.
[00:05:52] I might as well just pump out this licensing stuff.
[00:05:56] I can do it all at home and get my real estate license and just give it a shot.
[00:06:00] I definitely didn't expect to have the kind of success that I've had so far.
[00:06:05] I thought it would just be, you know, I'd sell a couple of houses a year and have a little
[00:06:08] bit of sight income.
[00:06:10] But it just took off right away.
[00:06:12] So that's how I did it.
[00:06:14] Stuck at home during COVID and thought, why not?
[00:06:17] Well, I'm probably a lot of our audiences like, it didn't just take off for me right
[00:06:22] away.
[00:06:23] So I want to hear a little bit about how you made that happen because, you know, you
[00:06:27] don't live in an area where there's a, you live in a town with a population of 3,000
[00:06:34] and of course you service beyond that, not just that, that town.
[00:06:37] But you are in a very rural area.
[00:06:40] I assume there's other REALTORS competing for all those deals as well.
[00:06:44] So it's not like things just fell into your lap and I'm sure it was a lot of hard work.
[00:06:50] And I've also too, I'm always impressed by REALTORS who are also moms and dads because
[00:06:56] they're usually also coaches, they volunteer.
[00:06:59] They're doing all these other things on top of being in this case of mom and a REALTOR.
[00:07:05] So I'm amazed that you're able to juggle all of this.
[00:07:09] But tell us like, when you first got started, how did you start going about getting business
[00:07:13] because people didn't know you as a REALTOR at that point?
[00:07:16] So how did you start conditioning everyone to look at Jen somewhere a lot differently?
[00:07:20] Yeah.
[00:07:22] I don't know how I juggle it all either.
[00:07:24] I'm just just so you know, it's like the spring and summer months when I'm just trying
[00:07:27] to survive day to day.
[00:07:29] But so how I just, you know, I mean, Malacca is where I grew up and so I know a lot of
[00:07:37] people I've been involved in my community grew up here when to college came back and so
[00:07:42] I have a pretty big sphere here and just connected to a lot of people and then I also coach
[00:07:49] at the high school.
[00:07:50] And so once I got my license, I honestly just started posting a ton on Facebook just
[00:07:57] to let people know that, hey, I have my real estate license.
[00:08:00] I'd love to help you.
[00:08:01] And then I just made it a goal to try to post almost every day some kind of real estate
[00:08:07] content just to keep myself in front of all my people.
[00:08:11] So that way when they had a real estate need, they would think of me.
[00:08:14] Sure.
[00:08:17] And part of me hated doing that because I was like, I don't want people to unfriend
[00:08:21] me because they're sick of all the real estate content.
[00:08:24] But I was like, you know, I just, I have to do it.
[00:08:27] It's part of the business.
[00:08:28] And so I'm going to do it if people want to unfollow me.
[00:08:31] I guess they'll unfollow me.
[00:08:34] I'm guessing probably nobody did unfollow you.
[00:08:37] But it is something that a lot of agents struggle with, right?
[00:08:41] We do sort of think about that.
[00:08:43] We think, gosh, if I start posting content on my personal page, maybe if you, you know,
[00:08:48] for those of us that don't have a separate business page on Facebook, if we're doing
[00:08:51] it on our personal, that is something to think about.
[00:08:54] When you were posting content when you first got started, was it content?
[00:08:59] I mean, I'm assuming it wasn't just listed just sold because you were new and you probably
[00:09:02] didn't have just listed just just just sold that kind of those kind of types of posts.
[00:09:07] So what types of content were you posting?
[00:09:10] Was it content that would be useful to people in your area?
[00:09:15] Yeah.
[00:09:16] So I would post like informational stuff that would help them as far as interest rates or,
[00:09:23] you know, if interest rates go down, this is what's going to happen to home values or,
[00:09:27] you know, those types of things.
[00:09:29] A lot of the, I guess stuff that we think we aren't experts in, like I would post that,
[00:09:36] just to, you know, stay top of minds and show that I knew what I was doing in real estate.
[00:09:42] One of the other things that I did for a while that I've kind of gotten away from, I should get
[00:09:46] back to, was just, like Friday find.
[00:09:49] So I would just post a deal that I thought was a good deal, whether that was in my area or whatever.
[00:09:57] Yeah, and just say, you know, you say who it's listed by, but if you're interested in it,
[00:10:01] reach out to me just, you know, to keep people like houses, no matter what, if you're the listing
[00:10:06] agent or not. And then once I started doing more deals, it was the client reviews and the
[00:10:12] just listed just sold the story of the transaction stuff like that.
[00:10:19] Yeah, that all perfectly makes sense.
[00:10:23] And, you know, I want to talk about today's market because you've had, you had some great success
[00:10:29] in your first four years and you're continuing to have success. You know, as you've,
[00:10:36] sort of progressed through your career, what are some of the ways that you think, what are some
[00:10:42] of the things you do that maybe separate you from, and you don't have to mention names, of course,
[00:10:47] but maybe other competition. Where are you doing differently than the competition?
[00:10:52] Yeah, so I do feel like I have an opportunity in my little rural market town because a lot of the
[00:10:59] agents here are just part of the smaller brokerages and they don't focus a lot on
[00:11:06] just, you know, bettering themselves as real estate agents. And that's why I chose the brokerage
[00:11:12] that I chose because I knew that I wanted to really learn how to be a professional in the business.
[00:11:16] So I think a lot of it is just operating at a professional level so that the people in my
[00:11:23] sphere and my clients really just trust me and buy into what I'm saying right away.
[00:11:29] And not that there's anything wrong with, you know, operating at a little bit more casual
[00:11:34] level, but that's just not, that's not how I wanted to present myself as a real estate agent.
[00:11:40] So I think that's probably the biggest thing. And then also just being connected to the community.
[00:11:48] I mean, everyone wants to work with someone that they know like and trust. And if,
[00:11:52] if they already know that you do it, like you've already won, you've won, you've won them over,
[00:11:56] you don't have to sell yourself. Yeah, I agree. And I also curious too, you coach softball at the
[00:12:03] local high school. And I would love to know how, now again, I'm sure you're not doing that for
[00:12:12] business purposes. You're doing that for the love of the sport. And, you know, because you have
[00:12:16] a passion for it. And were you a former softball player as well? Yeah, I was. Yeah, but I played in
[00:12:21] high school in college and it's my outlet. It's just the thing that I love. I get to get away from
[00:12:27] real estate for a while, even though I don't. You can ask my girls, they'll be like, are you talking
[00:12:31] to a client again? Or, you know, you're coaching, you know, I'm out on the base coaching. And
[00:12:37] I'm like, responding to this stuff. And the girls are like, coach. So it's kind of funny, but they
[00:12:42] get it. And I'm curious too. Like has it. And again, you're in a smaller community. So you're right.
[00:12:48] Everybody knows everything about everybody. At least that's how it felt growing up in the
[00:12:52] community. I grew up with is everybody knows. And, you know, you're really visible in your
[00:12:56] community, not just because of real estate, but because, you know, you do, you do a lot with,
[00:13:01] with the, you know, the girls on the softball team. Has that actually translated just sort of by way
[00:13:06] of people knowing that you're a REALTOR? Has that actually translated into deals just because of
[00:13:12] the softball? Yeah, I actually just closed one yesterday. One of the softball girls, the moms,
[00:13:19] she referred me, you know, which is a family friend. And so yeah, I closed them yesterday. And
[00:13:25] I'm starting to see now as some of these girls that I've coached for 10 years are getting older.
[00:13:32] Now I'm actually starting to see the fruit of that a little bit more. Sure.
[00:13:36] It wasn't immediate, but yeah, I'm starting to see the fruit of that more, which is pretty fun.
[00:13:43] It's fun to see it kind of start to, you know, come to fruition now this year. So
[00:13:48] one of one of the responses. So when we have guests on the show, just speaking to the audience here,
[00:13:53] we ask them a few questions just to help sort of prompt us for the interview. And Jen had a really
[00:13:59] unique response to sort of what he want to talk about today. And I liked her response because I
[00:14:04] think it's completely accurate. And she basically said, you know, everyone's looking for the magic
[00:14:09] formula or the magic bullet that that is going to, you know, help them become, you know, viral or just,
[00:14:14] you know, trying, you know, skyrocket their business. And Jen's like, I've never really had that.
[00:14:20] And that's not really like, I don't know about that stuff. She's like, I know about doing
[00:14:25] repeatable daily tasks, you know, I let I know about having routines. I know about discipline.
[00:14:30] And of course, a lot of that I imagine gets helps get installed at you or an athlete. So and you
[00:14:36] probably, you're still are an athlete. So this idea of discipline and being on a team and being
[00:14:42] coachable, I'm assuming those skills transfer pretty nicely in the real estate. Yeah, they for sure do.
[00:14:49] They for sure do. It's funny. The real estate team that I'm on, I don't know if it's just a
[00:14:55] personality thing or what it is, but all the agents on our team are either current or former
[00:15:00] athletes. And I think it is a lot of that mindset stuff where we're just, we've, it's ingrained in us
[00:15:05] to follow this routine, you know, and now it's more like it's a, it's a lead generation routine.
[00:15:11] It's get up and workout and take care of myself and get my kids at school and then the lead
[00:15:16] generation and the follow ups and all that stuff. But it's just the day and and day out grind
[00:15:21] that you don't want to do, but you just do it. Well, I always I said to I was talking to my
[00:15:28] my girlfriend Natalie last night and I said, I don't want to ever do push ups because who wants to
[00:15:35] do push ups. But it's a really good idea to do push ups, right? So so it's it's this idea of doing
[00:15:42] things every day that are difficult, but healthy, right? And so I think I'd love to talk to you
[00:15:49] about that because you have a lot of balls that you're juggling and you're running a household,
[00:15:55] you're running a business and of course you're coaching a girls team and rate, you know,
[00:16:01] doing all of the family stuff at on top of all of that. So how do you do it? I'll tell walk us
[00:16:08] through your routine. People like love to hear like when do you get up? When do you start working
[00:16:13] if you don't mind sharing that? Yeah, I'm a little bit crazy because I actually really love to
[00:16:21] work out. It's like my meantime. It's what keeps me sane. And so I'm usually up sometime between
[00:16:27] 430 and 5. I know your face. My jaw just dropped open at her in 430. I'm like, I know there's a 430.
[00:16:35] I've never seen it, but I've heard there's a 430. I'm sorry, go ahead. Yeah, so but realistically,
[00:16:41] you know, that's the time that I have to. I get up. So I have my workout time, which is in our
[00:16:47] hour and a half. And then I come I come back home, get myself and then my kids ready for school.
[00:16:53] Get them out the door. And then I usually have a little bit of wiggle room if I'm not going
[00:17:00] into the office that day. If I'm just working from home where I will do the household tasks.
[00:17:06] So laundry cleaning gets up already. And then 9 o'clock every day, along with my team, we log in
[00:17:12] to lead generation whether we're together in the office or we're, you know, on the Zoom
[00:17:17] meet in front of each other. And that's just holding each other accountable to the lead generation,
[00:17:23] you know, the different types of lead generation that we enjoy. And there's still types of lead
[00:17:30] generation that I have to do, even though I hate it, like I hate making calls. I'm just going to say
[00:17:35] it. That's not what I love. I like to be in front of people on social media. But I do still have
[00:17:41] to make those calls sometimes. But I have found that like the social media and being in front of my
[00:17:46] people that way and then just out in the communities, that's kind of my money maker. And so just doing
[00:17:52] the lead generation that works for me. And I think it's important for agents to know that that
[00:17:56] you can find different ways to lead generate and really say, you don't have to make a thousand
[00:18:01] cold calls a day. So it's very true. And I don't even know if cold calls even work anymore, really.
[00:18:10] But there are lots of ways, of course, to grow the business. And I'm really interested to in,
[00:18:18] you know, you were just saying, you know, I don't like making calls, but I still have to make
[00:18:21] care calls. I still have to do that. This is part of the discipline part, right? Where you're like,
[00:18:27] I don't want to like you love working out, but maybe you don't like making care calls, right? So,
[00:18:33] but you still do both, right? You're still doing it. And it, when you get up every day, are you just
[00:18:39] basically following a template that you've already established? You're like, I already know exactly
[00:18:44] what I'm going to do today. And I'm just curious about how you set your day up.
[00:18:49] Yeah, it's, it's the same thing every day, Monday to Friday. So once I finished lead generation
[00:18:55] around noon, then it's, you know, I try to like, I try to schedule the showings and the
[00:19:01] closing for in the afternoon. It doesn't always work that way. But that's the time then that's
[00:19:06] set aside for all the random things that have to get done. And then once I'm done with that,
[00:19:11] I have to pick up my kids. And then I'm, and then I'm full on mom because they're so pretty young,
[00:19:15] they're 9, 11 and 5. Lots of activities, lots of things. Yeah, yeah. And so,
[00:19:25] yeah. So, and then, you know, sometimes it's evenings, showings, and weekends. But that's my
[00:19:30] general daily template that I follow in my very day to day. Is, is the lead gen from 9 to 12,
[00:19:38] which that's a big block of time, is that is how significant, how important is that block of time
[00:19:45] for your business? Well, it's, it's like everything. If I didn't do it, I wouldn't, because once I get
[00:19:54] my kids in the afternoon, I usually just do the work that's absolutely necessary. I'm not trying to
[00:20:01] find new business at that time of the day. So if I don't do it in the morning, it just doesn't happen.
[00:20:09] Yeah, so I like that. That you time block so every day you already have a designated time and you
[00:20:14] have accountability, because there's other people that are also doing it at the same time. So there's
[00:20:19] just like strength and numbers will hold each other accountable, and we'll all show up at the same
[00:20:24] time virtually or in person. And we're going to just start, you know, pounding the phones or doing
[00:20:29] our call or whatever, whatever the actual, you know, gaining new business activity of the day is.
[00:20:37] And I, you know, I was thinking about that because it's something I need to do as well. So I
[00:20:41] recruit REALTORS and I was thinking, gosh, if I recruited for, if I did outreach for three hours
[00:20:47] a day, how many more agents would be here at our office? So you've actually inspired me to take a
[00:20:52] look at my calendar and get a little bit more, more synced with it. But I, I think that's got to be
[00:20:58] a huge part of your success is the rinse and repeat. Like every day I base, you know, things change,
[00:21:04] of course, things come up all the time. I'm sure you have three kids and every, it's all, every day's
[00:21:10] adventure. But I'm also sure that, you know, you're, you're sticking to the schedule pretty,
[00:21:15] pretty regularly, pretty regularly. And you have the discipline and you also know that you're not
[00:21:21] going to love every part of it, which is also a big thing because I think, you know, we're so
[00:21:25] conditioned, I think our phones sort of, well, I think they do us quite a few disservices. But one of
[00:21:31] the disservices is I think it makes us think, you know, if we don't like it, we don't want to do it.
[00:21:37] Because with our phones, we can get any sort of pleasure we want, you know, pretty much at our
[00:21:42] fingertips, right? You know, instantly for free. And we don't have to do a lot of hard things with
[00:21:47] your phone, right? So I love the fact that you have this sort of sports background and team background,
[00:21:52] which is all about doing the hard things for the better, the betterment of, of the team. And you,
[00:21:58] I want to talk about being coached. How important is it now? You're in your fourth year that you're still,
[00:22:05] and you talked about always improving that sort of an athlete mentality as well. How important is it to
[00:22:11] be coachable? Well, I find that the agent, well, you know, most agents get into the business and they
[00:22:20] get out of it within a year or two. I find that the agents that get out of it are the ones that
[00:22:28] aren't coachable. They're not willing to adapt and do the hard things that they don't want to do
[00:22:35] in order to find that business. So, I mean, being coachable is everything, right? In sports,
[00:22:43] as a coach, you like the kids that are coachable, you like the athletes that are coachable. And it's
[00:22:48] the same thing in real estate. I came, every new agent comes into the business not knowing a single
[00:22:55] thing. The stuff that we learn in those classes does not prepare us for selling real estate. And so,
[00:23:02] I wanted to surround myself with people, agents who have been in the business for several years,
[00:23:07] who I could really learn from and become as good as them and be coached by them. And so,
[00:23:14] I would encourage new agents if you don't have that, like you need to find it, especially if
[00:23:19] you're struggling to find business. If that means that you get on a team and you give up part of your
[00:23:24] commission for a couple of years just to learn the business, you are going to be so much further ahead
[00:23:29] than the agent that chooses to stay as a solo agent and is just trying to figure it out all on
[00:23:34] their own, their first couple of years in the business. And being on a team, that's definitely
[00:23:39] what's propelled me forward to because I really feel that being on a team has just taught me how to
[00:23:46] be that next level above, you know, the other agents in my market. Yeah, you bring up a good point.
[00:23:54] There's some expression and I'm going to butcher it a bit, but it's something like your life is the
[00:24:00] some, is the average of the five people closest to you, their lives. So, you know, some,
[00:24:07] some amalgamation of, you know, the people closest to you, you're kind of a reflection of that.
[00:24:12] And basically is what you just said. And I think that's really important to have a mastermind group.
[00:24:18] You have one and not only do you have one, you have one with similar sort of interests. You have,
[00:24:24] you have a athlete, you know, group and athletes, you know, have a certain mentality. They have certain,
[00:24:31] just ways of thinking that non-athletes don't have. And so I think that's probably really cool too
[00:24:37] because not only are you around people that are looking to get better, but these are people that
[00:24:41] are like you. So it's like these are your tribe. You guys get each other. And I think that's also
[00:24:47] another big thing is getting on. If you're looking for a team is finding a team that really has a
[00:24:53] similar sort of style or, you know, or maybe it makes sense to get a team that's totally different,
[00:25:00] I guess. I guess there's all sorts of different ways to do it. But I like the idea. I think the sense
[00:25:04] of feeling like this is, this is my group is really nice because you can, you sort of understand
[00:25:10] each other a little bit and you can support each other more effectively because you've both,
[00:25:13] you know, you've all been through in this case, you know, sort of the athletic world and and how,
[00:25:18] you know, how significant that is for your life. I would also like to talk a little bit about, you
[00:25:26] know, sort of, so, you know, actually, I wanted to share a story. So you just reminded me of something.
[00:25:32] So I grew up in a smaller town, not as small as I mentioned. But I, before I started this podcast,
[00:25:38] we had up like a hundred agents here at our firm and I thought, oh, I know somebody's sister,
[00:25:45] I know the sister of somebody who's one of the top agents in my hometown. So I just called up
[00:25:49] the sister and I said, hey, can I interview your brother? This is before I had a show. I just want
[00:25:53] to ask him how he got to be successful. He was closing a home every three days. That was his,
[00:25:57] his thing. And these were not high priced homes. These were like $150,000 homes on average. These,
[00:26:03] you know, but he was doing, you know, 100 plus a year. He's making a really nice income. He was
[00:26:08] one of the top agents in the city. I said, how do you think, how'd you get to that level?
[00:26:12] And he goes, I get in every day, just exactly what you said. I come in every day at seven or eight
[00:26:18] o'clock. I'm the first one here. I see everyone else show up about 11, 10, 11, they kind of file in
[00:26:25] half coffee. They're not really working. He's like, I shut my door. I prospectal noon. Exactly what
[00:26:30] you said. And then I go about my day. He's like, that's, he goes, that's the secret of my success.
[00:26:35] And I said, well, there's more to it than that. He goes, not really. He's like, that's pretty much it.
[00:26:40] And I said, yeah, that makes sense because I always love this, this, this sort of really simple
[00:26:48] statement, which is if you want to double your business and you don't want to,
[00:26:53] and you don't want to double your skills, then just double your prospecting. Because if you just
[00:26:59] double your prospecting and you never get better as a REALTOR, you will absolutely double your
[00:27:03] sales. You should also get better as a REALTOR as a course. But if all you do is double your
[00:27:07] prospecting, you'll basically double your business. So anyway, sorry to just sort of jump all over
[00:27:13] your interview here, but I just remind you of something. Jim, I also want to talk about being
[00:27:20] visible in your market because you are in a small market where, of course, everyone sees everything
[00:27:26] we talked about. Does it feel like pressure for you to always, do you feel a sense of pressure
[00:27:33] to always be professional out in the, you know, when you're when you're coaching softball or when
[00:27:39] you're, you know, grocery shopping, is there a sense of like, I am always, people are always
[00:27:44] observing. And does that ever come into your mind about how to act around sort of the public?
[00:27:51] Um, a little bit. Yeah. And at the same time, I want to be myself. Like I don't, I don't go out
[00:28:00] looking like a scrub either, you know, but like, and that's part of being involved in the community
[00:28:04] too and coaching is like, that, that is who I am. And I want to attract the clients who want to
[00:28:10] work with me because they know me and they like me. And that I felt that pressure the first couple
[00:28:17] years in business that I had to like mold myself to this person and then to that person.
[00:28:23] But I found that I attracted some business that I was not fun. And now after being in the business
[00:28:30] a couple years, I've just taken the pressure off myself. And I'm not pressing as hard to convince
[00:28:37] people to work with me. I'm just being myself and showing up online in the community. And those
[00:28:44] people are naturally just coming to me because, you know, I think people like authenticity.
[00:28:52] They do. They absolutely do. And you know, you're in a community which has limited opportunity
[00:28:58] because there's just not as many people there. So I want to talk about buyers specifically because
[00:29:04] it we believe most markets would say it's a sellers market right now. And there's lots of buyers out
[00:29:10] there who are struggling. So can you give us any tips or suggestions about what you've been
[00:29:16] doing with buyers currently just to help get deals closed? Yeah. So I mean, I'll try to keep it short.
[00:29:23] So it's kind of interesting because my business the past three years up until this year has been
[00:29:29] more listing heavy. But this past year it's been about 50, 50 buyers sellers. So that means I've had
[00:29:36] 20 buyers, 20 sellers. And none of my buyers have lost out in multiple offers this year. And I
[00:29:45] think it's just due to some intentionality in from the first time that I talked to those buyers,
[00:29:52] setting up a buyer consultation meeting with them. So that's what I do. Talk to them, get them
[00:29:58] connected with the lender. We don't even talk price point or location until I can connect them with
[00:30:04] the lender and sit down with them and go over all the things that I need to go over with them in
[00:30:09] that in that buyer consultation. So that'll last an hour and a half to two hours. And I'm just
[00:30:15] unloading a ton of information on them, making sure that they're pre-approved. We go over the
[00:30:20] buyer presentation just to set them up for, you know, the expectations of what to expect. Talk
[00:30:25] about the market in their area. How long houses are sitting on the market if they're sitting or not?
[00:30:33] If something is listed at $350, it doesn't necessarily mean it's going to sell at $350. You may have
[00:30:38] to pay $10,000 more than the list price. And I talk about different buyer tools that we may use to
[00:30:47] get their offer accepted. So, you know, if we're going to ask for seller paid calls in costs or not,
[00:30:54] if we're going to do escalation clause, just all those things, the different types of inspections,
[00:30:59] of one of the big, probably the biggest thing that has gotten my buyers offers accepted this year
[00:31:06] is not necessarily them being the highest offer. It's being the most flexible offer.
[00:31:14] Can you speak more about that? Yeah, so I will always, always call the listing agent. If you are
[00:31:22] a real estate agent out there and you're not calling the listing agent and just building that good
[00:31:26] rapport right away, that might be why your buyers offers aren't getting accepted. So definitely make
[00:31:32] that call. And so I just say, hey, my buyers really loved your listing at 123 Main Street.
[00:31:41] We have the opportunity to be a little bit flexible. What exactly are your sellers looking for that
[00:31:47] you can share with me? And so I love that. I'm a positive, I'm going to pause that for a second.
[00:31:53] Because what you said is a very, very powerful phrase and there's a pre-supposition in there.
[00:31:59] So what you said is, hey, my buyers are interested. What can you tell me from your seller? What are
[00:32:07] you willing to share with me to help get this deal closed? Is essentially what you said? It didn't
[00:32:12] say can you share with me. You said, what are you willing to share with me? Which presupposes there
[00:32:17] is information to give you. And it's also an authentic, an honest question. And it shows that you
[00:32:23] really care. It shows that you're like, hey, I want to make this happen. Let me know. So it seems
[00:32:28] like a kind of a throw away phrase, but it's a very powerful phrase because it implies I need to
[00:32:34] make this deal close. I want to work with you. Let's get this done. And that is very exciting
[00:32:40] to a listing agent. Yeah, I mean, the biggest thing is too is like, it's not a my buyers versus your
[00:32:46] sellers. It's a the buyers, the sellers. How can we make this feel good for everybody? Like, I think
[00:32:52] sometimes agents take representing their client to the extreme where it's like, they got to be
[00:32:58] got to mean mean to each other. And that's, that's not it. It's, it's making it a win-win for everybody.
[00:33:04] So that's a really important call and some of this stuff, this is all, these are all things that I
[00:33:09] talk about in that buyer meeting just to really set the expectation for the buyers of ways that we
[00:33:15] it might work to be a little bit more flexible to get your offer accepted. So one of those big things
[00:33:20] is letting the sellers stay in the house a couple days after closing, you know, through the
[00:33:27] the delayed closing. Because sometimes it's tricky to line up closings from the buying and the
[00:33:33] selling. So that's been, that's been a huge one. When I make that call to the listing agent, I also
[00:33:39] ask them, or I make sure to let them know that my buyers are pre approved with my preferred lender.
[00:33:45] He's awesome. Would you like a call from him after we submit our offer? Oh, I love that.
[00:33:52] Yeah, I know I appreciate that as a listing agent. I want to know if these buyers have a good
[00:33:58] lender and I want to know that the lender is going to pick up the phone on the evenings and weekends.
[00:34:03] And so that's a big thing too that I talk to the buyers about is let's not get pre approved with
[00:34:07] Wells Fargo. Let's get pre approved with the lender who doesn't clock in and clock out.
[00:34:14] Yeah, so that's a big one. In that buyer meeting, I also go through the purchase agreement.
[00:34:18] What does that look like? And then we have that commission conversation.
[00:34:25] So that's that's that is that a new add-on because of the NAR settlement or were you always having
[00:34:30] the commission question or is that been the yeah, yeah, it's a new add-on. So the question that I
[00:34:36] asked the buyers because I know everyone hears things differently from the news. They say,
[00:34:40] what do you know about how I'm going to get paid to represent you? Oh, I like that. That's a really
[00:34:45] smart question because then you can reset that expectation or correct any misunderstanding.
[00:34:51] And I would assume the public really doesn't really understand it anyway, but go ahead and yeah,
[00:34:57] I'd say more. Yeah, so you know, I get all kinds of different answers. Well, we heard we have to
[00:35:03] pay you now or I don't know anything about it. And so then I just break it down from I said,
[00:35:11] in Minnesota, we've been a full disclosure state. So for us in most cases, the commission is not
[00:35:17] changing. In most cases, I'm going to get paid by the seller to represent you. However, we do
[00:35:23] still have those circumstances where a seller refuses is going to refuse to pay me to represent you.
[00:35:32] And if that's the case, then I need to get paid somehow. And so then I talk about how, you know,
[00:35:40] either we're going to have to maybe offer more than what the sellers are asking for to make up
[00:35:44] the difference in that commission or you guys are going to have to come out of pocket. And
[00:35:49] then we talk about the different commission structures. So we have to have different levels of commissions on
[00:35:56] our team. I love that. So the different levels of service based on different commission structures.
[00:36:02] Yep. Yep. So we go over that. Most people are going to pick this the standard, you know, the lowest,
[00:36:09] which is what what any buyer's agent, the kind of service that they would provide anyway. But we do
[00:36:14] have a few higher levels of that with, you know, we have an ISA that our team has that will call
[00:36:21] around to off-market properties or just some of the above and beyond things that a lot of agents
[00:36:27] don't maybe don't have access to because they're not paying for an ISA. Sure.
[00:36:32] Those types of things. So so then most times people are going to choose that the lowest commission
[00:36:39] so we sign the commission agreement and I let them know I say when you guys represent me just so
[00:36:45] you know my job is to get you the best deal and get hopefully get the seller to pay my commission
[00:36:53] and so my goals to get them to pay all of it but they might not. So you may need to pay some of it
[00:36:58] all of it or none at all. But at the end of the day my job is to get you the best deal possible.
[00:37:04] That sounds good to you. So then they sign they choose their their tiered commission and
[00:37:12] and then they know then they have that expectation set up front. So you know sometimes you have a
[00:37:16] buyer that finds a FSBO and if you don't have that so yeah so it's it's been helpful. I
[00:37:23] actually I've actually up to my buyer's agent commission with this new stuff. So yeah well now you
[00:37:30] can justify a little bit more of all the activities that you're doing and you can list them out and
[00:37:37] it's it's just a bit more you know visible I guess. So I love that and I you know what what I'm
[00:37:46] really hearing from you throughout your entire process working with clients is setting expectation
[00:37:53] and what we would call like coping ahead like basically saying here's how this thing works. Let me
[00:38:01] go through some examples of some homes that were in your price range that have sold recently in the
[00:38:06] area. Let's look at what they listed for. Let's look at what they sold for. Let's talk about how the
[00:38:11] process works. Obviously you're having the commission question as well which we're required to do
[00:38:15] now and you're basically just saying this is the process and and you know I was thinking too like
[00:38:22] if you when you start having that commission question if somebody says well I didn't I don't
[00:38:26] remember writing a check last time I bought a home to my REALTOR right something like that you
[00:38:31] I'm sure you have an answer for that as well which is like well you're always really paying
[00:38:35] commissions you just didn't see it they were built into the price really nothing's changed it's
[00:38:40] just the way that the money gets to me is a little has just shifted but it's it's all coming out
[00:38:46] the same pot essentially so have you have you run into any resistance from buyers on the commission
[00:38:54] piece of it? Actually no I mean I had one set of buyers that I met with that that never they didn't
[00:39:02] sign the they didn't sign with me they they talked to another agent so that would probably be the
[00:39:08] only resistance but all my other ones I've actually really appreciated this disclosure now that we
[00:39:15] have because I just have to set the expectation up front they have to sign the buyer rep before I
[00:39:22] can show them a home and so it makes it easier for me I like it because you know it's long now like
[00:39:28] we we got to do this sorry guys like so yeah I like it I suspect your secret sauce at least initially
[00:39:36] is having those one and a half to two hour long buyer consultations it really just setting the
[00:39:42] stage and it's not so much of a wide-gen summer lot is the greatest agent in the area although I'm
[00:39:48] sure you do say here here's what I've accomplished I think it's a lot of this is how it works this is
[00:39:54] what this is this is what you'll experience along the way here's how we'll deal with it and I will
[00:40:00] tell you that is it it seems simple but it is a very powerful in my opinion a very powerful strategy
[00:40:08] because all along the home buying and selling process there are ups and downs right in every transaction
[00:40:13] or just about there's something that goes wrong there's something that goes unexpected and it gets
[00:40:18] stressful and it gets you know scary or you get angry or you know people it's just what happens
[00:40:24] and I love the fact that you're basically saying ahead of time there's going to be things that happen
[00:40:30] along the way here's what we're going to do to to to confront that and you're basically just
[00:40:36] setting the stage so when those events happen whether they're expected or unexpected you've already
[00:40:42] primed your client for this I I don't think most REALTORS do that I don't think most REALTORS say
[00:40:48] here's the process going I mean I think they go great I what do you want to buy okay cool let's go
[00:40:53] look at some homes well you know I think most REALTORS do do that just fine but this idea of really
[00:40:59] prepping the person for all the other stuff the really hard stuff that's coming I wonder if that is
[00:41:06] your secret sauce yeah I think it also it sets you up as a professional and it they trust you
[00:41:13] right away they buy in because if you're going through the purchase agreement and all this stuff
[00:41:18] most buyers are so overwhelmed and they're like wow we need you to help us and so it's it's
[00:41:26] almost a bit of that first meeting overwhelmed you to let them see what I'm going to bring to the
[00:41:32] table to represent them and then yeah I don't set them on this up on the search or talk about
[00:41:37] any of that until they've signed the buyer representation very smart I have a question so once you
[00:41:45] work with a client and the transaction concludes so we'll say you know successful transaction
[00:41:51] what are you doing to stay top of mind to those previous clients so that when they you know maybe
[00:41:59] that they'll obviously hopefully talk about you to people they know but also that they'll use you
[00:42:03] again so how are you staying in touch after the sale yeah so I I try to add all of them to my
[00:42:10] socials because I feel like that's one of the best ways especially if they're younger I shouldn't
[00:42:15] say that there's a lot of older the older generation that uses that now too but so I try to add
[00:42:21] them to my socials so that it's more that friend to friend you know communication seeing me on
[00:42:28] the social media a little bit more relaxed but we have this smart plan setup so our clients get
[00:42:35] setup on smart plans that are they're follow-ups so you know a week after closing call and see how
[00:42:43] it's going in the house or whatever every December I make a call to all my buyers my new buyers
[00:42:49] from that year and make sure they've homesteaded their property I've had a few who have totally
[00:42:55] forgotten them who have been so appreciative that I saved them a couple thousand on property taxes
[00:43:00] yeah inviting them to client events I don't send out cards it's something that I feel like I
[00:43:07] should probably get better at I do have the advantage of my my lender we have the co-branded stuff
[00:43:13] and he sends everything out which is awesome that you know it takes something off of my plate
[00:43:18] um and then just like those those check-ins with them quarterly and then when they go into the CRM
[00:43:28] they're getting market updates and they're getting or five best things news letter that goes out
[00:43:35] every week so I think they get touched like a hundred times a year there's just a bunch of different
[00:43:42] touches that they're getting and a lot of it's the automated stuff well I live here in Chicago
[00:43:48] and McDonald's is headquartered here and I'm not in any way suggesting your business and McDonald's
[00:43:54] are analogous but what I will say is I get hit with McDonald's advertising or McDonald's branding
[00:44:03] is what I should say not advertising all day long every day because of Chicago and it is funny
[00:44:11] because it does it absolutely I probably get a hundred you know McDonald's sort of I don't know
[00:44:22] you call experiences every month I bet and as a result I'm constantly thinking about McDonald's
[00:44:28] even though I don't often eat there because I don't you know it's not maybe the healthiest
[00:44:33] choice for me in most cases or at least I don't choose the healthy options if they have them there
[00:44:38] but the point is is that because I'm seeing it over and over and over and over again it's kind of
[00:44:43] like always a little bit on my mind like I wonder what they're doing in McDonald's these days and
[00:44:47] again that sounds completely silly but if you're touching your your sphere a hundred times a year
[00:44:53] and I can they're not reading all hundred items or they're not seeing all hundred things maybe they're
[00:44:57] even maybe they're just deleting them or throwing them away if it's a but they see your name for a
[00:45:02] split second before that delete button gets hit or they before they throw the postcard away
[00:45:07] and that's all that matters is is is that and I love that so I want to talk about 2025 because you
[00:45:15] are an athlete athletes love goals they love getting better um what are your goals or what are some
[00:45:22] of your goals for 2025 yeah so I'm actually lowering my my unit school for this year because I'm
[00:45:31] gonna try to do more personal deals flip flip opportunities um just because those aren't as time
[00:45:40] consuming and I did a couple this year that were pretty fruitful um so right about 35 units is
[00:45:47] going to be my goal but then also an extra like 300,000 in flipping houses um so you know I don't
[00:45:57] how many total properties that's gonna come out to that they're all different um so about half you
[00:46:03] know maybe about a third of my income and actually traditionally selling real estate and then
[00:46:09] you know the majority of it in flipping but we'll see um and then I I represent a couple builders
[00:46:20] right now and so one of the things that I'm planning to do is implement a design into my business
[00:46:26] a little bit more to help those builders because I find that sometimes the builders they don't
[00:46:32] pick the best finishes um so just really figuring out what I can do to come alongside the builders
[00:46:38] and make their life easier to put out a good product that's gonna sell and then in that I'm gonna
[00:46:44] try to I'm gonna try to acquire one to two more builders to represent so yeah 35 units give or take
[00:46:53] the flips and then implementing design and fighting a couple more builders two last questions
[00:46:58] one how did you start to learn about real estate investing did you learn on your own did you
[00:47:04] go out and um you know were you reading online were you do you have mentor how did you how did you
[00:47:10] start learning about that that's a good question I really just started investing in the in the last
[00:47:15] year because you know four years under the business now have a little bit of wiggle room in the budget
[00:47:20] um my team lead era he he's awesome he has his his hands in a bunch of different places of investing
[00:47:29] and so I learn a lot from him um podcasts and then just I don't know just just getting into it I
[00:47:41] I was scared to to jump into buying that first investment property because I'm like what if I fail
[00:47:47] and I will I lose money on it and you have to get to the point where you just have to do it I think
[00:47:52] it's the same when making those calls you're scared to do it but like what's the worst it's gonna
[00:47:56] happen someone's gonna hang up on you so and and what's the worst that's gonna happen in a flip you
[00:48:02] lose money well okay that's not the end of the world right like it could be if you make a really
[00:48:09] poor decision but yeah it's you know the fear of failure that's what I love about athletes athletes
[00:48:14] are like well if I if it fails I'll just try something else like you're used to failing failings no
[00:48:20] big deal yeah I mean failings what makes you better right yeah so you have to learn from the failures
[00:48:27] and I feel like that's what I've gotten better in the business too is I've had some big failures
[00:48:31] but those have made me a better agent because I've learned that my clients want me to lead them
[00:48:37] as a professional I kind of started out a little timid and I wasn't leading my clients and I'm like
[00:48:41] they're they're hiring me because I'm the professional and they want me to lead them
[00:48:46] so yeah use those failures as a learning opportunity for sure I agree and just because nobody is
[00:48:54] perfect and our audience loves to know that you're actually human what are you struggling
[00:48:59] within your business right now what is not going as well as you would like it to need to work on
[00:49:04] that obviously this year yeah man I find that selling houses right now being the listing agent
[00:49:11] is just giving me a lot of challenges because I don't know about other markets but currently in
[00:49:18] Minnesota we always experience a little bit of a slowdown in the winter months right but
[00:49:25] houses that you think are gonna sell right away aren't and houses that you think are gonna sit
[00:49:29] on the market are going like in a week or two and so I actually had like $29,000 in GCI fall apart
[00:49:37] two weeks ago because of the low appraisal I was representing both sides the appraisal came in
[00:49:45] $60,000 low even though the comparables that we use supported it the purchase price and so
[00:49:52] at the end of the day sellers weren't gonna come down 60,000 and I didn't advise them to do that
[00:49:57] and the buyers weren't gonna make up a $60,000 appraisal gap and I didn't advise them to do that
[00:50:02] so those deals do fall apart and yeah I've had a couple of them this year where it's like
[00:50:10] it's just heartbreaking but at the end of the day if you've done everything that you could do and
[00:50:15] it's out of your control you have to move on and onward and the next business.
[00:50:22] Yeah and you know to sort of go back to your coaching sort of metaphor is like the best
[00:50:28] softball player strike out a lot of course or they ground out a lot or they hit fly balls that get caught
[00:50:34] or you know or they they fall you know tip to the to the catcher whatever it is they're
[00:50:41] the idea of failing is just part of the deal right it's just part of the deal and it hurts when
[00:50:48] it's a $30,000 you know failure but you have to have almost build it into the business plan almost
[00:50:56] like I'm gonna lose a big deal to every year and I was the thing too like you're so good at
[00:51:02] setting expectations you have as an athlete you're used to not winning you know because you win
[00:51:08] sometimes and you don't win other times so this idea of not winning I think that's really the key
[00:51:14] is like how do you handle not winning and you let's actually talk about that so I know if I you
[00:51:21] know 30,000 in GCI that would that would send me into a pretty serious depression so you know
[00:51:28] now I hopefully we get up the next day but it wouldn't be a good day for me how do you get past
[00:51:33] something this is my last question how do you get past those big setbacks?
[00:51:39] Well it's just like in sports you don't learn when you win you learn when you lose
[00:51:45] so how do I get past the big setbacks? Well I mean for me personally when that one fell apart I
[00:51:52] was like you know what I've still had a good year and I still have a good pipeline and I can still
[00:51:58] go find more business and I can't dwell on something that I can't change so yeah I'm gonna be
[00:52:05] I'm gonna be upset for a day I'm gonna be powdering maybe winding a little bit like this I want to
[00:52:14] look back and I think I love this business so yeah more deals are gonna come so you have to
[00:52:19] get back on the horse and you have to keep going yeah it's mindset and also too you know it's
[00:52:26] about expectation like this is what happens sometimes sometimes the ball does not you know
[00:52:33] go through the net like sometimes it just doesn't and there's nothing we can do about and I love
[00:52:37] the fact that you you're basically quoted the serenity prayer which I think is about the wisest
[00:52:42] prayer I've ever heard which is you know the knowing what you can change what you can't change knowing
[00:52:48] you know and knowing what you can influence what you can't and not suffering the stuff that you can't
[00:52:53] change and I think it's about probably the wisest prayer and we're not a religious or a type of
[00:53:01] podcast but that is a pretty practical tool to use you know can I change what has happened if not
[00:53:09] you know you said I have a pipeline I can get more business so you didn't just even say well I've
[00:53:15] got all these other deals in the pipeline no big deal you said I can get more business you said
[00:53:20] that very specifically and I don't know if our audience caught that but that is that is that is
[00:53:25] that is the secret of Jen Summerlott she she she loses deals too and she goes I can get more deals
[00:53:31] like you didn't it didn't it wasn't even a stressful thing for you and you're only in your fourth
[00:53:36] year it's not like I've been doing this 25 years I can get more deals you just have this self
[00:53:41] confidence knowing well four years ago I didn't have any deals so now I've all these deals I created
[00:53:46] that so I guess I could create more there's there's no reason why I couldn't and I love that mentality
[00:53:51] I think that mindset is is such a great mentality because it just means okay I can go I have to put
[00:53:58] some I have to go do some more pushups I guess I have to do some more pushups that will get me
[00:54:02] more deals you know whatever that version of a pushup is and and you're doing it from nine to
[00:54:07] 12 every single day so I would say for everyone listening we're gonna let Jen uh enjoy the rest of her
[00:54:14] this is a holiday week actually Jen's we're recording this just before Thanksgiving we're gonna let
[00:54:18] and by the way Jen's making an entire meal for her family so we're gonna let her get back to not
[00:54:24] only being coach and and and team member and REALTOR and mom but we're gonna let her go back to
[00:54:31] all of her different duties as as well as being a podcast guest um but Jen what what I I wanted to
[00:54:38] really as I was listening to you talk it sounds like structure discipline prospecting and just
[00:54:46] kind of being really intentional like make your life very intentional choose what you do choose
[00:54:53] these things and then when things happen to you that are unfavorable which happens to all of us you
[00:55:00] you were still choosing you're still making other choices to continue on the path right so I think
[00:55:07] this idea of intentionally making choices is something that you know maybe comes naturally or to you
[00:55:14] because you you've been in sports for so long but a lot of us we just let life happen to us right
[00:55:19] life happens like we lose a deal and it's like oh I was what I was hoping for that which which happens
[00:55:24] it happens to Jen too yeah I have this deal and yeah of course of course and and we and we can move
[00:55:32] forward because again we can you know we can remind ourselves before this industry I didn't have
[00:55:37] any deals right so I love that Jen you know I love talking to athletes because they tend to be
[00:55:45] not as much talkers as doers and I think you are in that same group you're just a doer you just
[00:55:52] like put the blinders on put me to work get me get me in the in the in the gym of real estate and I
[00:55:58] will work out and I will I will come out and I will be a little bit stronger and that is that's how I
[00:56:05] see you it's clearly how you've been building your business and you already have your 2025 goals set
[00:56:11] up you know what you're doing this is all about intentionality you're you're planning so on
[00:56:16] behalf of everyone let's thank Jen for reminding us how to run our business this is a really really
[00:56:23] great lesson to a room it lesson for me too prospect prospect prospect every single day do the hard

My conversation with Jenny Somerlott. Today on the show, my guest is Jenny Somerlott with Peterson and Company, which is part of Keller Williams-Elk River in Malacca. Now let me tell you more about Jen. Now, Jenny is a self-proclaimed country girl, a REALTOR specializing in rural real estate transactions, involving land splits, acreages, and farms in central rural Minnesota. With a proven track record, she closed 24 units in her first year. That's incredible. 22 in her second year, 30 in her third year, and 40 in her fourth year demonstrating her dedication and expertise. She takes a relationship-focused approach, serving clients with the same care she would extend to family and friends. As a busy mom to three boys and a varsity softball coach, Jen understands the value of being invested in her community and finding the perfect fit for each family. Her personalized no-pressure approach has made her a trusted advisor for those looking to buy or sell in Minnesota's rural heartland. What everybody to check out Jen at her website, which is Jen.sold in MN. Jen.sold in MN.com. We'll have a link to that in the show notes. And I want you to follow her on Instagram. If nothing else, follow her on Instagram. Jen, I'm apologize. What is your Instagram again? Yeah, just at Jen Summerlot. At Jen Summerlot. We'll have a link to that in the show notes. Jen, my apologies. I had it in front of me and then I lost it. So thanks for coming to my rescue. Without further ado, Jen Summerlot, everyone. Hi, Jen. How are you? Good. How are you? Good. I'm really excited to talk to you because I grew up in a smaller city, not as small as where you are. But I went to school, surrounded by corn fields. I'm from Central Illinois. And I very much feel more connected to rural, people who live in rural areas than maybe even people live in urban environments. I live in the city now here in Chicago. But we know that there are REALTORS all over, not just the major metropolitan markets. And so I'm super excited to chat with you because you've been having incredible success for somebody in your first four years there. That is an incredible story. And I'd love to sort of go back to the beginning and really hear about why you got into real estate. So tell us how that happened. Yeah, so it was something that I've always been interested in. Ever since a little girl, I just loved houses and dreaming of what the inside of houses looked like. But when to college did the stay-at-home mom thing for quite a while. And I think it was 2019 when I started my pre-licensing, you know, kind of just as COVID was hitting. And I thought, you know, why don't I just, I'm stuck at home anyways. I might as well just pump out this licensing stuff. I can do it all at home and get my real estate license and just give it a shot. I definitely didn't expect to have the kind of success that I've had so far. I thought it would just be, you know, I'd sell a couple of houses a year and have a little bit of sight income. But it just took off right away. So that's how I did it. Stuck at home during COVID and thought, why not? Well, I'm probably a lot of our audiences like, it didn't just take off for me right away. So I want to hear a little bit about how you made that happen because, you know, you don't live in an area where there's a, you live in a town with a population of 3,000 and of course you service beyond that, not just that, that town. But you are in a very rural area. I assume there's other REALTORS competing for all those deals as well. So it's not like things just fell into your lap and I'm sure it was a lot of hard work. And I've also too, I'm always impressed by REALTORS who are also moms and dads because they're usually also coaches, they volunteer. They're doing all these other things on top of being in this case of mom and a REALTOR. So I'm amazed that you're able to juggle all of this. But tell us like, when you first got started, how did you start going about getting business because people didn't know you as a REALTOR at that point? So how did you start conditioning everyone to look at Jen somewhere a lot differently? Yeah. I don't know how I juggle it all either. I'm just just so you know, it's like the spring and summer months when I'm just trying to survive day to day. But so how I just, you know, I mean, Malacca is where I grew up and so I know a lot of people I've been involved in my community grew up here when to college came back and so I have a pretty big sphere here and just connected to a lot of people and then I also coach at the high school. And so once I got my license, I honestly just started posting a ton on Facebook just to let people know that, hey, I have my real estate license. I'd love to help you. And then I just made it a goal to try to post almost every day some kind of real estate content just to keep myself in front of all my people. So that way when they had a real estate need, they would think of me. Sure. And part of me hated doing that because I was like, I don't want people to unfriend me because they're sick of all the real estate content. But I was like, you know, I just, I have to do it. It's part of the business. And so I'm going to do it if people want to unfollow me. I guess they'll unfollow me. I'm guessing probably nobody did unfollow you. But it is something that a lot of agents struggle with, right? We do sort of think about that. We think, gosh, if I start posting content on my personal page, maybe if you, you know, for those of us that don't have a separate business page on Facebook, if we're doing it on our personal, that is something to think about. When you were posting content when you first got started, was it content? I mean, I'm assuming it wasn't just listed just sold because you were new and you probably didn't have just listed just just just sold that kind of those kind of types of posts. So what types of content were you posting? Was it content that would be useful to people in your area? Yeah. So I would post like informational stuff that would help them as far as interest rates or, you know, if interest rates go down, this is what's going to happen to home values or, you know, those types of things. A lot of the, I guess stuff that we think we aren't experts in, like I would post that, just to, you know, stay top of minds and show that I knew what I was doing in real estate. One of the other things that I did for a while that I've kind of gotten away from, I should get back to, was just, like Friday find. So I would just post a deal that I thought was a good deal, whether that was in my area or whatever. Yeah, and just say, you know, you say who it's listed by, but if you're interested in it, reach out to me just, you know, to keep people like houses, no matter what, if you're the listing agent or not. And then once I started doing more deals, it was the client reviews and the just listed just sold the story of the transaction stuff like that. Yeah, that all perfectly makes sense. And, you know, I want to talk about today's market because you've had, you had some great success in your first four years and you're continuing to have success. You know, as you've, sort of progressed through your career, what are some of the ways that you think, what are some of the things you do that maybe separate you from, and you don't have to mention names, of course, but maybe other competition. Where are you doing differently than the competition? Yeah, so I do feel like I have an opportunity in my little rural market town because a lot of the agents here are just part of the smaller brokerages and they don't focus a lot on just, you know, bettering themselves as real estate agents. And that's why I chose the brokerage that I chose because I knew that I wanted to really learn how to be a professional in the business. So I think a lot of it is just operating at a professional level so that the people in my sphere and my clients really just trust me and buy into what I'm saying right away. And not that there's anything wrong with, you know, operating at a little bit more casual level, but that's just not, that's not how I wanted to present myself as a real estate agent. So I think that's probably the biggest thing. And then also just being connected to the community. I mean, everyone wants to work with someone that they know like and trust. And if, if they already know that you do it, like you've already won, you've won, you've won them over, you don't have to sell yourself. Yeah, I agree. And I also curious too, you coach softball at the local high school. And I would love to know how, now again, I'm sure you're not doing that for business purposes. You're doing that for the love of the sport. And, you know, because you have a passion for it. And were you a former softball player as well? Yeah, I was. Yeah, but I played in high school in college and it's my outlet. It's just the thing that I love. I get to get away from real estate for a while, even though I don't. You can ask my girls, they'll be like, are you talking to a client again? Or, you know, you're coaching, you know, I'm out on the base coaching. And I'm like, responding to this stuff. And the girls are like, coach. So it's kind of funny, but they get it. And I'm curious too. Like has it. And again, you're in a smaller community. So you're right. Everybody knows everything about everybody. At least that's how it felt growing up in the community. I grew up with is everybody knows. And, you know, you're really visible in your community, not just because of real estate, but because, you know, you do, you do a lot with, with the, you know, the girls on the softball team. Has that actually translated just sort of by way of people knowing that you're a REALTOR? Has that actually translated into deals just because of the softball? Yeah, I actually just closed one yesterday. One of the softball girls, the moms, she referred me, you know, which is a family friend. And so yeah, I closed them yesterday. And I'm starting to see now as some of these girls that I've coached for 10 years are getting older. Now I'm actually starting to see the fruit of that a little bit more. Sure. It wasn't immediate, but yeah, I'm starting to see the fruit of that more, which is pretty fun. It's fun to see it kind of start to, you know, come to fruition now this year. So one of one of the responses. So when we have guests on the show, just speaking to the audience here, we ask them a few questions just to help sort of prompt us for the interview. And Jen had a really unique response to sort of what he want to talk about today. And I liked her response because I think it's completely accurate. And she basically said, you know, everyone's looking for the magic formula or the magic bullet that that is going to, you know, help them become, you know, viral or just, you know, trying, you know, skyrocket their business. And Jen's like, I've never really had that. And that's not really like, I don't know about that stuff. She's like, I know about doing repeatable daily tasks, you know, I let I know about having routines. I know about discipline. And of course, a lot of that I imagine gets helps get installed at you or an athlete. So and you probably, you're still are an athlete. So this idea of discipline and being on a team and being coachable, I'm assuming those skills transfer pretty nicely in the real estate. Yeah, they for sure do. They for sure do. It's funny. The real estate team that I'm on, I don't know if it's just a personality thing or what it is, but all the agents on our team are either current or former athletes. And I think it is a lot of that mindset stuff where we're just, we've, it's ingrained in us to follow this routine, you know, and now it's more like it's a, it's a lead generation routine. It's get up and workout and take care of myself and get my kids at school and then the lead generation and the follow ups and all that stuff. But it's just the day and and day out grind that you don't want to do, but you just do it. Well, I always I said to I was talking to my my girlfriend Natalie last night and I said, I don't want to ever do push ups because who wants to do push ups. But it's a really good idea to do push ups, right? So so it's it's this idea of doing things every day that are difficult, but healthy, right? And so I think I'd love to talk to you about that because you have a lot of balls that you're juggling and you're running a household, you're running a business and of course you're coaching a girls team and rate, you know, doing all of the family stuff at on top of all of that. So how do you do it? I'll tell walk us through your routine. People like love to hear like when do you get up? When do you start working if you don't mind sharing that? Yeah, I'm a little bit crazy because I actually really love to work out. It's like my meantime. It's what keeps me sane. And so I'm usually up sometime between 430 and 5. I know your face. My jaw just dropped open at her in 430. I'm like, I know there's a 430. I've never seen it, but I've heard there's a 430. I'm sorry, go ahead. Yeah, so but realistically, you know, that's the time that I have to. I get up. So I have my workout time, which is in our hour and a half. And then I come I come back home, get myself and then my kids ready for school. Get them out the door. And then I usually have a little bit of wiggle room if I'm not going into the office that day. If I'm just working from home where I will do the household tasks. So laundry cleaning gets up already. And then 9 o'clock every day, along with my team, we log in to lead generation whether we're together in the office or we're, you know, on the Zoom meet in front of each other. And that's just holding each other accountable to the lead generation, you know, the different types of lead generation that we enjoy. And there's still types of lead generation that I have to do, even though I hate it, like I hate making calls. I'm just going to say it. That's not what I love. I like to be in front of people on social media. But I do still have to make those calls sometimes. But I have found that like the social media and being in front of my people that way and then just out in the communities, that's kind of my money maker. And so just doing the lead generation that works for me. And I think it's important for agents to know that that you can find different ways to lead generate and really say, you don't have to make a thousand cold calls a day. So it's very true. And I don't even know if cold calls even work anymore, really. But there are lots of ways, of course, to grow the business. And I'm really interested to in, you know, you were just saying, you know, I don't like making calls, but I still have to make care calls. I still have to do that. This is part of the discipline part, right? Where you're like, I don't want to like you love working out, but maybe you don't like making care calls, right? So, but you still do both, right? You're still doing it. And it, when you get up every day, are you just basically following a template that you've already established? You're like, I already know exactly what I'm going to do today. And I'm just curious about how you set your day up. Yeah, it's, it's the same thing every day, Monday to Friday. So once I finished lead generation around noon, then it's, you know, I try to like, I try to schedule the showings and the closing for in the afternoon. It doesn't always work that way. But that's the time then that's set aside for all the random things that have to get done. And then once I'm done with that, I have to pick up my kids. And then I'm, and then I'm full on mom because they're so pretty young, they're 9, 11 and 5. Lots of activities, lots of things. Yeah, yeah. And so, yeah. So, and then, you know, sometimes it's evenings, showings, and weekends. But that's my general daily template that I follow in my very day to day. Is, is the lead gen from 9 to 12, which that's a big block of time, is that is how significant, how important is that block of time for your business? Well, it's, it's like everything. If I didn't do it, I wouldn't, because once I get my kids in the afternoon, I usually just do the work that's absolutely necessary. I'm not trying to find new business at that time of the day. So if I don't do it in the morning, it just doesn't happen. Yeah, so I like that. That you time block so every day you already have a designated time and you have accountability, because there's other people that are also doing it at the same time. So there's just like strength and numbers will hold each other accountable, and we'll all show up at the same time virtually or in person. And we're going to just start, you know, pounding the phones or doing our call or whatever, whatever the actual, you know, gaining new business activity of the day is. And I, you know, I was thinking about that because it's something I need to do as well. So I recruit REALTORS and I was thinking, gosh, if I recruited for, if I did outreach for three hours a day, how many more agents would be here at our office? So you've actually inspired me to take a look at my calendar and get a little bit more, more synced with it. But I, I think that's got to be a huge part of your success is the rinse and repeat. Like every day I base, you know, things change, of course, things come up all the time. I'm sure you have three kids and every, it's all, every day's adventure. But I'm also sure that, you know, you're, you're sticking to the schedule pretty, pretty regularly, pretty regularly. And you have the discipline and you also know that you're not going to love every part of it, which is also a big thing because I think, you know, we're so conditioned, I think our phones sort of, well, I think they do us quite a few disservices. But one of the disservices is I think it makes us think, you know, if we don't like it, we don't want to do it. Because with our phones, we can get any sort of pleasure we want, you know, pretty much at our fingertips, right? You know, instantly for free. And we don't have to do a lot of hard things with your phone, right? So I love the fact that you have this sort of sports background and team background, which is all about doing the hard things for the better, the betterment of, of the team. And you, I want to talk about being coached. How important is it now? You're in your fourth year that you're still, and you talked about always improving that sort of an athlete mentality as well. How important is it to be coachable? Well, I find that the agent, well, you know, most agents get into the business and they get out of it within a year or two. I find that the agents that get out of it are the ones that aren't coachable. They're not willing to adapt and do the hard things that they don't want to do in order to find that business. So, I mean, being coachable is everything, right? In sports, as a coach, you like the kids that are coachable, you like the athletes that are coachable. And it's the same thing in real estate. I came, every new agent comes into the business not knowing a single thing. The stuff that we learn in those classes does not prepare us for selling real estate. And so, I wanted to surround myself with people, agents who have been in the business for several years, who I could really learn from and become as good as them and be coached by them. And so, I would encourage new agents if you don't have that, like you need to find it, especially if you're struggling to find business. If that means that you get on a team and you give up part of your commission for a couple of years just to learn the business, you are going to be so much further ahead than the agent that chooses to stay as a solo agent and is just trying to figure it out all on their own, their first couple of years in the business. And being on a team, that's definitely what's propelled me forward to because I really feel that being on a team has just taught me how to be that next level above, you know, the other agents in my market. Yeah, you bring up a good point. There's some expression and I'm going to butcher it a bit, but it's something like your life is the some, is the average of the five people closest to you, their lives. So, you know, some, some amalgamation of, you know, the people closest to you, you're kind of a reflection of that. And basically is what you just said. And I think that's really important to have a mastermind group. You have one and not only do you have one, you have one with similar sort of interests. You have, you have a athlete, you know, group and athletes, you know, have a certain mentality. They have certain, just ways of thinking that non-athletes don't have. And so I think that's probably really cool too because not only are you around people that are looking to get better, but these are people that are like you. So it's like these are your tribe. You guys get each other. And I think that's also another big thing is getting on. If you're looking for a team is finding a team that really has a similar sort of style or, you know, or maybe it makes sense to get a team that's totally different, I guess. I guess there's all sorts of different ways to do it. But I like the idea. I think the sense of feeling like this is, this is my group is really nice because you can, you sort of understand each other a little bit and you can support each other more effectively because you've both, you know, you've all been through in this case, you know, sort of the athletic world and and how, you know, how significant that is for your life. I would also like to talk a little bit about, you know, sort of, so, you know, actually, I wanted to share a story. So you just reminded me of something. So I grew up in a smaller town, not as small as I mentioned. But I, before I started this podcast, we had up like a hundred agents here at our firm and I thought, oh, I know somebody's sister, I know the sister of somebody who's one of the top agents in my hometown. So I just called up the sister and I said, hey, can I interview your brother? This is before I had a show. I just want to ask him how he got to be successful. He was closing a home every three days. That was his, his thing. And these were not high priced homes. These were like $150,000 homes on average. These, you know, but he was doing, you know, 100 plus a year. He's making a really nice income. He was one of the top agents in the city. I said, how do you think, how'd you get to that level? And he goes, I get in every day, just exactly what you said. I come in every day at seven or eight o'clock. I'm the first one here. I see everyone else show up about 11, 10, 11, they kind of file in half coffee. They're not really working. He's like, I shut my door. I prospectal noon. Exactly what you said. And then I go about my day. He's like, that's, he goes, that's the secret of my success. And I said, well, there's more to it than that. He goes, not really. He's like, that's pretty much it. And I said, yeah, that makes sense because I always love this, this, this sort of really simple statement, which is if you want to double your business and you don't want to, and you don't want to double your skills, then just double your prospecting. Because if you just double your prospecting and you never get better as a REALTOR, you will absolutely double your sales. You should also get better as a REALTOR as a course. But if all you do is double your prospecting, you'll basically double your business. So anyway, sorry to just sort of jump all over your interview here, but I just remind you of something. Jim, I also want to talk about being visible in your market because you are in a small market where, of course, everyone sees everything we talked about. Does it feel like pressure for you to always, do you feel a sense of pressure to always be professional out in the, you know, when you're when you're coaching softball or when you're, you know, grocery shopping, is there a sense of like, I am always, people are always observing. And does that ever come into your mind about how to act around sort of the public? Um, a little bit. Yeah. And at the same time, I want to be myself. Like I don't, I don't go out looking like a scrub either, you know, but like, and that's part of being involved in the community too and coaching is like, that, that is who I am. And I want to attract the clients who want to work with me because they know me and they like me. And that I felt that pressure the first couple years in business that I had to like mold myself to this person and then to that person. But I found that I attracted some business that I was not fun. And now after being in the business a couple years, I've just taken the pressure off myself. And I'm not pressing as hard to convince people to work with me. I'm just being myself and showing up online in the community. And those people are naturally just coming to me because, you know, I think people like authenticity. They do. They absolutely do. And you know, you're in a community which has limited opportunity because there's just not as many people there. So I want to talk about buyers specifically because it we believe most markets would say it's a sellers market right now. And there's lots of buyers out there who are struggling. So can you give us any tips or suggestions about what you've been doing with buyers currently just to help get deals closed? Yeah. So I mean, I'll try to keep it short. So it's kind of interesting because my business the past three years up until this year has been more listing heavy. But this past year it's been about 50, 50 buyers sellers. So that means I've had 20 buyers, 20 sellers. And none of my buyers have lost out in multiple offers this year. And I think it's just due to some intentionality in from the first time that I talked to those buyers, setting up a buyer consultation meeting with them. So that's what I do. Talk to them, get them connected with the lender. We don't even talk price point or location until I can connect them with the lender and sit down with them and go over all the things that I need to go over with them in that in that buyer consultation. So that'll last an hour and a half to two hours. And I'm just unloading a ton of information on them, making sure that they're pre-approved. We go over the buyer presentation just to set them up for, you know, the expectations of what to expect. Talk about the market in their area. How long houses are sitting on the market if they're sitting or not? If something is listed at $350, it doesn't necessarily mean it's going to sell at $350. You may have to pay $10,000 more than the list price. And I talk about different buyer tools that we may use to get their offer accepted. So, you know, if we're going to ask for seller paid calls in costs or not, if we're going to do escalation clause, just all those things, the different types of inspections, of one of the big, probably the biggest thing that has gotten my buyers offers accepted this year is not necessarily them being the highest offer. It's being the most flexible offer. Can you speak more about that? Yeah, so I will always, always call the listing agent. If you are a real estate agent out there and you're not calling the listing agent and just building that good rapport right away, that might be why your buyers offers aren't getting accepted. So definitely make that call. And so I just say, hey, my buyers really loved your listing at 123 Main Street. We have the opportunity to be a little bit flexible. What exactly are your sellers looking for that you can share with me? And so I love that. I'm a positive, I'm going to pause that for a second. Because what you said is a very, very powerful phrase and there's a pre-supposition in there. So what you said is, hey, my buyers are interested. What can you tell me from your seller? What are you willing to share with me to help get this deal closed? Is essentially what you said? It didn't say can you share with me. You said, what are you willing to share with me? Which presupposes there is information to give you. And it's also an authentic, an honest question. And it shows that you really care. It shows that you're like, hey, I want to make this happen. Let me know. So it seems like a kind of a throw away phrase, but it's a very powerful phrase because it implies I need to make this deal close. I want to work with you. Let's get this done. And that is very exciting to a listing agent. Yeah, I mean, the biggest thing is too is like, it's not a my buyers versus your sellers. It's a the buyers, the sellers. How can we make this feel good for everybody? Like, I think sometimes agents take representing their client to the extreme where it's like, they got to be got to mean mean to each other. And that's, that's not it. It's, it's making it a win-win for everybody. So that's a really important call and some of this stuff, this is all, these are all things that I talk about in that buyer meeting just to really set the expectation for the buyers of ways that we it might work to be a little bit more flexible to get your offer accepted. So one of those big things is letting the sellers stay in the house a couple days after closing, you know, through the the delayed closing. Because sometimes it's tricky to line up closings from the buying and the selling. So that's been, that's been a huge one. When I make that call to the listing agent, I also ask them, or I make sure to let them know that my buyers are pre approved with my preferred lender. He's awesome. Would you like a call from him after we submit our offer? Oh, I love that. Yeah, I know I appreciate that as a listing agent. I want to know if these buyers have a good lender and I want to know that the lender is going to pick up the phone on the evenings and weekends. And so that's a big thing too that I talk to the buyers about is let's not get pre approved with Wells Fargo. Let's get pre approved with the lender who doesn't clock in and clock out. Yeah, so that's a big one. In that buyer meeting, I also go through the purchase agreement. What does that look like? And then we have that commission conversation. So that's that's that is that a new add-on because of the NAR settlement or were you always having the commission question or is that been the yeah, yeah, it's a new add-on. So the question that I asked the buyers because I know everyone hears things differently from the news. They say, what do you know about how I'm going to get paid to represent you? Oh, I like that. That's a really smart question because then you can reset that expectation or correct any misunderstanding. And I would assume the public really doesn't really understand it anyway, but go ahead and yeah, I'd say more. Yeah, so you know, I get all kinds of different answers. Well, we heard we have to pay you now or I don't know anything about it. And so then I just break it down from I said, in Minnesota, we've been a full disclosure state. So for us in most cases, the commission is not changing. In most cases, I'm going to get paid by the seller to represent you. However, we do still have those circumstances where a seller refuses is going to refuse to pay me to represent you. And if that's the case, then I need to get paid somehow. And so then I talk about how, you know, either we're going to have to maybe offer more than what the sellers are asking for to make up the difference in that commission or you guys are going to have to come out of pocket. And then we talk about the different commission structures. So we have to have different levels of commissions on our team. I love that. So the different levels of service based on different commission structures. Yep. Yep. So we go over that. Most people are going to pick this the standard, you know, the lowest, which is what what any buyer's agent, the kind of service that they would provide anyway. But we do have a few higher levels of that with, you know, we have an ISA that our team has that will call around to off-market properties or just some of the above and beyond things that a lot of agents don't maybe don't have access to because they're not paying for an ISA. Sure. Those types of things. So so then most times people are going to choose that the lowest commission so we sign the commission agreement and I let them know I say when you guys represent me just so you know my job is to get you the best deal and get hopefully get the seller to pay my commission and so my goals to get them to pay all of it but they might not. So you may need to pay some of it all of it or none at all. But at the end of the day my job is to get you the best deal possible. That sounds good to you. So then they sign they choose their their tiered commission and and then they know then they have that expectation set up front. So you know sometimes you have a buyer that finds a FSBO and if you don't have that so yeah so it's it's been helpful. I actually I've actually up to my buyer's agent commission with this new stuff. So yeah well now you can justify a little bit more of all the activities that you're doing and you can list them out and it's it's just a bit more you know visible I guess. So I love that and I you know what what I'm really hearing from you throughout your entire process working with clients is setting expectation and what we would call like coping ahead like basically saying here's how this thing works. Let me go through some examples of some homes that were in your price range that have sold recently in the area. Let's look at what they listed for. Let's look at what they sold for. Let's talk about how the process works. Obviously you're having the commission question as well which we're required to do now and you're basically just saying this is the process and and you know I was thinking too like if you when you start having that commission question if somebody says well I didn't I don't remember writing a check last time I bought a home to my REALTOR right something like that you I'm sure you have an answer for that as well which is like well you're always really paying commissions you just didn't see it they were built into the price really nothing's changed it's just the way that the money gets to me is a little has just shifted but it's it's all coming out the same pot essentially so have you have you run into any resistance from buyers on the commission piece of it? Actually no I mean I had one set of buyers that I met with that that never they didn't sign the they didn't sign with me they they talked to another agent so that would probably be the only resistance but all my other ones I've actually really appreciated this disclosure now that we have because I just have to set the expectation up front they have to sign the buyer rep before I can show them a home and so it makes it easier for me I like it because you know it's long now like we we got to do this sorry guys like so yeah I like it I suspect your secret sauce at least initially is having those one and a half to two hour long buyer consultations it really just setting the stage and it's not so much of a wide-gen summer lot is the greatest agent in the area although I'm sure you do say here here's what I've accomplished I think it's a lot of this is how it works this is what this is this is what you'll experience along the way here's how we'll deal with it and I will tell you that is it it seems simple but it is a very powerful in my opinion a very powerful strategy because all along the home buying and selling process there are ups and downs right in every transaction or just about there's something that goes wrong there's something that goes unexpected and it gets stressful and it gets you know scary or you get angry or you know people it's just what happens and I love the fact that you're basically saying ahead of time there's going to be things that happen along the way here's what we're going to do to to to confront that and you're basically just setting the stage so when those events happen whether they're expected or unexpected you've already primed your client for this I I don't think most REALTORS do that I don't think most REALTORS say here's the process going I mean I think they go great I what do you want to buy okay cool let's go look at some homes well you know I think most REALTORS do do that just fine but this idea of really prepping the person for all the other stuff the really hard stuff that's coming I wonder if that is your secret sauce yeah I think it also it sets you up as a professional and it they trust you right away they buy in because if you're going through the purchase agreement and all this stuff most buyers are so overwhelmed and they're like wow we need you to help us and so it's it's almost a bit of that first meeting overwhelmed you to let them see what I'm going to bring to the table to represent them and then yeah I don't set them on this up on the search or talk about any of that until they've signed the buyer representation very smart I have a question so once you work with a client and the transaction concludes so we'll say you know successful transaction what are you doing to stay top of mind to those previous clients so that when they you know maybe that they'll obviously hopefully talk about you to people they know but also that they'll use you again so how are you staying in touch after the sale yeah so I I try to add all of them to my socials because I feel like that's one of the best ways especially if they're younger I shouldn't say that there's a lot of older the older generation that uses that now too but so I try to add them to my socials so that it's more that friend to friend you know communication seeing me on the social media a little bit more relaxed but we have this smart plan setup so our clients get setup on smart plans that are they're follow-ups so you know a week after closing call and see how it's going in the house or whatever every December I make a call to all my buyers my new buyers from that year and make sure they've homesteaded their property I've had a few who have totally forgotten them who have been so appreciative that I saved them a couple thousand on property taxes yeah inviting them to client events I don't send out cards it's something that I feel like I should probably get better at I do have the advantage of my my lender we have the co-branded stuff and he sends everything out which is awesome that you know it takes something off of my plate um and then just like those those check-ins with them quarterly and then when they go into the CRM they're getting market updates and they're getting or five best things news letter that goes out every week so I think they get touched like a hundred times a year there's just a bunch of different touches that they're getting and a lot of it's the automated stuff well I live here in Chicago and McDonald's is headquartered here and I'm not in any way suggesting your business and McDonald's are analogous but what I will say is I get hit with McDonald's advertising or McDonald's branding is what I should say not advertising all day long every day because of Chicago and it is funny because it does it absolutely I probably get a hundred you know McDonald's sort of I don't know you call experiences every month I bet and as a result I'm constantly thinking about McDonald's even though I don't often eat there because I don't you know it's not maybe the healthiest choice for me in most cases or at least I don't choose the healthy options if they have them there but the point is is that because I'm seeing it over and over and over and over again it's kind of like always a little bit on my mind like I wonder what they're doing in McDonald's these days and again that sounds completely silly but if you're touching your your sphere a hundred times a year and I can they're not reading all hundred items or they're not seeing all hundred things maybe they're even maybe they're just deleting them or throwing them away if it's a but they see your name for a split second before that delete button gets hit or they before they throw the postcard away and that's all that matters is is is that and I love that so I want to talk about 2025 because you are an athlete athletes love goals they love getting better um what are your goals or what are some of your goals for 2025 yeah so I'm actually lowering my my unit school for this year because I'm gonna try to do more personal deals flip flip opportunities um just because those aren't as time consuming and I did a couple this year that were pretty fruitful um so right about 35 units is going to be my goal but then also an extra like 300,000 in flipping houses um so you know I don't how many total properties that's gonna come out to that they're all different um so about half you know maybe about a third of my income and actually traditionally selling real estate and then you know the majority of it in flipping but we'll see um and then I I represent a couple builders right now and so one of the things that I'm planning to do is implement a design into my business a little bit more to help those builders because I find that sometimes the builders they don't pick the best finishes um so just really figuring out what I can do to come alongside the builders and make their life easier to put out a good product that's gonna sell and then in that I'm gonna try to I'm gonna try to acquire one to two more builders to represent so yeah 35 units give or take the flips and then implementing design and fighting a couple more builders two last questions one how did you start to learn about real estate investing did you learn on your own did you go out and um you know were you reading online were you do you have mentor how did you how did you start learning about that that's a good question I really just started investing in the in the last year because you know four years under the business now have a little bit of wiggle room in the budget um my team lead era he he's awesome he has his his hands in a bunch of different places of investing and so I learn a lot from him um podcasts and then just I don't know just just getting into it I I was scared to to jump into buying that first investment property because I'm like what if I fail and I will I lose money on it and you have to get to the point where you just have to do it I think it's the same when making those calls you're scared to do it but like what's the worst it's gonna happen someone's gonna hang up on you so and and what's the worst that's gonna happen in a flip you lose money well okay that's not the end of the world right like it could be if you make a really poor decision but yeah it's you know the fear of failure that's what I love about athletes athletes are like well if I if it fails I'll just try something else like you're used to failing failings no big deal yeah I mean failings what makes you better right yeah so you have to learn from the failures and I feel like that's what I've gotten better in the business too is I've had some big failures but those have made me a better agent because I've learned that my clients want me to lead them as a professional I kind of started out a little timid and I wasn't leading my clients and I'm like they're they're hiring me because I'm the professional and they want me to lead them so yeah use those failures as a learning opportunity for sure I agree and just because nobody is perfect and our audience loves to know that you're actually human what are you struggling within your business right now what is not going as well as you would like it to need to work on that obviously this year yeah man I find that selling houses right now being the listing agent is just giving me a lot of challenges because I don't know about other markets but currently in Minnesota we always experience a little bit of a slowdown in the winter months right but houses that you think are gonna sell right away aren't and houses that you think are gonna sit on the market are going like in a week or two and so I actually had like $29,000 in GCI fall apart two weeks ago because of the low appraisal I was representing both sides the appraisal came in $60,000 low even though the comparables that we use supported it the purchase price and so at the end of the day sellers weren't gonna come down 60,000 and I didn't advise them to do that and the buyers weren't gonna make up a $60,000 appraisal gap and I didn't advise them to do that so those deals do fall apart and yeah I've had a couple of them this year where it's like it's just heartbreaking but at the end of the day if you've done everything that you could do and it's out of your control you have to move on and onward and the next business. Yeah and you know to sort of go back to your coaching sort of metaphor is like the best softball player strike out a lot of course or they ground out a lot or they hit fly balls that get caught or you know or they they fall you know tip to the to the catcher whatever it is they're the idea of failing is just part of the deal right it's just part of the deal and it hurts when it's a $30,000 you know failure but you have to have almost build it into the business plan almost like I'm gonna lose a big deal to every year and I was the thing too like you're so good at setting expectations you have as an athlete you're used to not winning you know because you win sometimes and you don't win other times so this idea of not winning I think that's really the key is like how do you handle not winning and you let's actually talk about that so I know if I you know 30,000 in GCI that would that would send me into a pretty serious depression so you know now I hopefully we get up the next day but it wouldn't be a good day for me how do you get past something this is my last question how do you get past those big setbacks? Well it's just like in sports you don't learn when you win you learn when you lose so how do I get past the big setbacks? Well I mean for me personally when that one fell apart I was like you know what I've still had a good year and I still have a good pipeline and I can still go find more business and I can't dwell on something that I can't change so yeah I'm gonna be I'm gonna be upset for a day I'm gonna be powdering maybe winding a little bit like this I want to look back and I think I love this business so yeah more deals are gonna come so you have to get back on the horse and you have to keep going yeah it's mindset and also too you know it's about expectation like this is what happens sometimes sometimes the ball does not you know go through the net like sometimes it just doesn't and there's nothing we can do about and I love the fact that you you're basically quoted the serenity prayer which I think is about the wisest prayer I've ever heard which is you know the knowing what you can change what you can't change knowing you know and knowing what you can influence what you can't and not suffering the stuff that you can't change and I think it's about probably the wisest prayer and we're not a religious or a type of podcast but that is a pretty practical tool to use you know can I change what has happened if not you know you said I have a pipeline I can get more business so you didn't just even say well I've got all these other deals in the pipeline no big deal you said I can get more business you said that very specifically and I don't know if our audience caught that but that is that is that is that is the secret of Jen Summerlott she she she loses deals too and she goes I can get more deals like you didn't it didn't it wasn't even a stressful thing for you and you're only in your fourth year it's not like I've been doing this 25 years I can get more deals you just have this self confidence knowing well four years ago I didn't have any deals so now I've all these deals I created that so I guess I could create more there's there's no reason why I couldn't and I love that mentality I think that mindset is is such a great mentality because it just means okay I can go I have to put some I have to go do some more pushups I guess I have to do some more pushups that will get me more deals you know whatever that version of a pushup is and and you're doing it from nine to 12 every single day so I would say for everyone listening we're gonna let Jen uh enjoy the rest of her this is a holiday week actually Jen's we're recording this just before Thanksgiving we're gonna let and by the way Jen's making an entire meal for her family so we're gonna let her get back to not only being coach and and and team member and REALTOR and mom but we're gonna let her go back to all of her different duties as as well as being a podcast guest um but Jen what what I I wanted to really as I was listening to you talk it sounds like structure discipline prospecting and just kind of being really intentional like make your life very intentional choose what you do choose these things and then when things happen to you that are unfavorable which happens to all of us you you were still choosing you're still making other choices to continue on the path right so I think this idea of intentionally making choices is something that you know maybe comes naturally or to you because you you've been in sports for so long but a lot of us we just let life happen to us right life happens like we lose a deal and it's like oh I was what I was hoping for that which which happens it happens to Jen too yeah I have this deal and yeah of course of course and and we and we can move forward because again we can you know we can remind ourselves before this industry I didn't have any deals right so I love that Jen you know I love talking to athletes because they tend to be not as much talkers as doers and I think you are in that same group you're just a doer you just like put the blinders on put me to work get me get me in the in the in the gym of real estate and I will work out and I will I will come out and I will be a little bit stronger and that is that's how I see you it's clearly how you've been building your business and you already have your 2025 goals set up you know what you're doing this is all about intentionality you're you're planning so on behalf of everyone let's thank Jen for reminding us how to run our business this is a really really great lesson to a room it lesson for me too prospect prospect prospect every single day do the hard things and you'll you'll get results you know the good news too is there's so many people that have come
